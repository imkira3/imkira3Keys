00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,014
Daily Sentinel.

3
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,724
One minute, please.

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,438
The mayor doesn't want the article
to print until after the next quarter.

5
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,026
Tell the mayor I'm insulted.

6
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,613
I'd never jeopardise the journalistic
integrity of this newspaper...

7
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,157
...for some rent-a-mayor's
political agenda.

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,366
Very well, Mr.--

9
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,538
So, Britt.

10
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,958
Here we are again.

11
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,962
Sent home after another
schoolyard fight.

12
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,256
I know you miss your mother.

13
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,050
So do I.

14
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,930
But I have to take care
of 750 employees...

15
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,724
...and you have to
take care of yourself.

16
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,604
Still, that seems to be
asking too much.

17
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,398
I was trying to stop some bullies
and the guy hit me.

18
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,151
Trying doesn't matter
when you always fail.

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,447
No! No!

20
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,787
Do you think it makes
me happy to do this?

21
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,622
- Yes!
- No, it doesn't.

22
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,793
But not a week goes by without you
finding yourself in trouble.

23
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,045
If you're doing this for attention...

24
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,548
...you have all that I can
afford to give you.

25
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,508
And you're wasting my time.

26
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,585
Frank!

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,591
No, no. Not you.

28
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,977
Have a seat.

29
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,647
Either one.
They're both very comfortable.

30
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,238
So, what can I do for you?

31
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,406
As you know...

32
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,952
...I've worked my entire life,
very hard, to achieve one goal.

33
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,622
And that goal...

34
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,999
...which I have,
in fact, achieved...

35
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,045
...was to be in charge of all the crime
in the city of Los Angeles.

36
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,380
Therefore...

37
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,300
...the fact that you assume
that you can...

38
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,886
...open this establishment
without my permission...

39
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,390
...without payment, and sell narcotics
out of it, is completely unacceptable.

40
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,558
Really?

41
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,935
And, to be honest...

42
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,436
...quite insulting.

43
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,065
Therefore, you must
sign over ownership...

44
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,942
...of this establishment to me...

45
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,152
...at which time,
you become my employees.

46
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,612
We're your employees?

47
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,155
Yeah. Or...

48
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,698
...close down permanently.

49
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,200
Choice is yours.

50
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,577
Okay. How do I pronounce
your name?

51
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,579
Tchaikovsky?

52
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,039
Chudnofsky.

53
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,791
Char-- Chudofsk--

54
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,251
Chowdofsky?

55
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,424
Chud-nof-sky.

56
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,385
Chudnofsky?

57
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,388
All right.
Chudnofsky, kiss my ass.

58
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,058
Put your lips to my ass...

59
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,394
...and kiss it. French kiss it.

60
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,688
Tickle it with your grey whiskers.

61
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,065
I got bittersweet news for you.

62
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,025
You're washed-up.

63
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,945
You're old. You're boring.
You're not scary.

64
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,863
You dress like shit.

65
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,117
It's over for you, okay?
That's the bitter news.

66
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,910
Now the sweet news is:

67
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,328
You can retire.

68
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,622
You can go play golf...

69
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,209
...eat your dinners at 3:00
in the afternoon...

70
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:59,089
...play with your grandkids,
drink Metamucil, old people shit.

71
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,508
Okay? Look at me.

72
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,386
I got a name people can say.

73
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,305
My name's Danny Clear.

74
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,348
I deal crystal meth.

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,476
People call me Crystal Clear.
It's easy.

76
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,271
Check out my kick-ass
hangout here.

77
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,149
I got shitloads of glass
everywhere.

78
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,692
I got a see-through piano.

79
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,902
Look at my boys.

80
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,904
They're pimped out.

81
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,406
We got Gucci...

82
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,907
...Armani...

83
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,327
...another Gucci, tailor-made.

84
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,123
This is what you need
to get to the top today.

85
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,750
Not hard work.

86
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,210
Not dressing like
Disco Santa Claus.

87
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,129
You need charisma.

88
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,756
You look like my Uncle Greg.

89
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,093
A very nice guy, but, you know,
he's a dentist.

90
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,472
Now consider this
your retirement letter.

91
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,309
It's over.

92
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,853
See your way out.

93
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,068
What, you truly
don't think I'm scary?

94
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,404
No.

95
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,535
Okay, okay, you're scary.

96
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,037
Shit, you're scary.

97
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,246
You just said I'm not.

98
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,831
No, no, you are. You are.

99
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,625
What's a "Disco Santa"?

100
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,794
"A Disco Sa--"? I don't know.

101
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,961
Sorry.

102
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,463
It was just something stupid.

103
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,881
You said I'm boring.

104
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,009
My gun has two barrels.
That's not boring.

105
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,387
And it was very difficult to make.

106
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,181
Answer me!

107
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,432
What?

108
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,894
What could I do
to be more scary?

109
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,396
A better name?

110
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,313
Cooler name?

111
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,731
More colour or something.

112
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,111
Maybe you could say
something to people...

113
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,987
...before you kill them.
But not now.

114
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,949
It's hard to think with this
double-barrel in my face.

115
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:49,950
Sorry.

116
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,749
You've given me
a lot to think about.

117
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,798
You're not gonna kill me?
Oh, I get it.

118
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,301
You keep me alive
so I can spread your legend.

119
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,888
Okay, I'll do that, man.
I'll spread your legend.

120
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,932
Hey, you forgot your briefcase.

121
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,214
Let's get this party crazy!

122
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,509
Behold, my lady.

123
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,403
That's the good stuff.

124
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,197
Oh, man.

125
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,411
Good morning....

126
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,664
Ana Lee.

127
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,874
Ana Lee. That's what I meant.

128
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,586
Oh, shit.

129
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,967
Son. This what you want
from your life?

130
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,054
This....

131
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,224
This gives you
a sense of fulfilment?

132
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,519
Dad, I told you,
tomorrow I'm enrolling...

133
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,730
...in ITT Technical Institute...

134
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,232
...and I'm gonna fix computers
for a living, so--

135
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:11,776
I spend...

136
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,653
...all night writing an editorial...

137
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,406
...about the nausea this town
has come to inspire.

138
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,784
About the corruption, the violence
and the decadence...

139
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,704
...that we've come to expect
as part of our daily life.

140
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,874
Then I have to turn the page...

141
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,169
...and see my own son's
contribution...

142
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,962
...to this mayhem.

143
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,800
Sweet! I'm in the paper?

144
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,469
Now, you may think you're...

145
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,678
...humiliating me...

146
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,805
...but you're humiliating yourself.

147
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,808
Sorry. If you don't like it,
just ask them not to print it.

148
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,976
It's your newspaper.

149
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,437
I can't, because, unfortunately,
it's news.

150
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,897
That's a good point.

151
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,940
I kept myself out of
the papers for years.

152
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,984
Now do me a favour
and do the same.

153
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,319
And I told you...

154
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,405
...stop taking girls
into my garage.

155
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,034
You do it again,
I'll change the lock.

156
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,497
- Okay, but can you sign this for me?
- Yeah.

157
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,088
"Never stop the partay."

158
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,570
Look at these.

159
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,366
My shoe.

160
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,159
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

161
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,412
I'm very uncomfortable.

162
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,623
Who is it?

163
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,459
Paparazzi in the house.

164
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,211
Change the channel.

165
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,922
I think we may have our
first visual on Britt Reid.

166
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,800
- Go, go, go! Go! Get in there!
- It's for me. Hello?

167
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,051
Get in there!

168
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,639
And how are you coping
with your father's death?

169
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,890
Give us some insight!

170
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,309
If you're just joining us...

171
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,979
...James Reid has been found dead
from an allergic...

172
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,731
...reaction to a bee sting...

173
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,774
...leaving his son his media empire.

174
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,318
How are you coping
with your father's death?

175
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,970
It was during my
election campaign...

176
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,848
...for district attorney
that I first met James Reid.

177
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,185
And it was immediately clear to me
that he was a man of...

178
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,145
...infallible integrity.

179
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,149
He dedicated himself to this city
through his philanthropic endeavours...

180
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,526
...and his newspaper,
The Daily Sentinel...

181
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,403
...a shining beacon of truth.

182
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,448
He was our North Star.

183
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,325
He showed us the way.

184
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,536
Thank you, James.

185
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,135
Britt, your father was truly...

186
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,387
...a great man.
When I started campaigning...

187
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,639
...he gave me some--

188
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,724
The best businessman
I've ever known.

189
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,143
- He always came out on top.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

190
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,436
Britt?

191
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,397
Britt.

192
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,818
Hey. I'm so sorry for your loss.

193
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,362
I just wanted to say
that my father...

194
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,657
...was a federal court judge,
so I think I know how it feels.

195
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,036
When he passed away,
I had some pretty big shoes to fill.

196
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,538
Just like you.

197
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,958
So if you ever need
somebody to talk to....

198
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,754
I mean, if you ever just want to grab
a drink, you want to get cheered up...

199
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,714
...I'm around.

200
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,676
Okay, thanks, man.
I really appreciate--

201
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,344
- Lock it up.
- Yeah. Okay.

202
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,429
- Keep it tight.
- Cool.

203
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,943
This is your newspaper...

204
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,031
...but the burden doesn't
have to fall on you alone.

205
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,372
I've been your father's...

206
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,458
...most trusted colleague
for the past 45 years.

207
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,587
I'm gonna make sure
The Daily Sentinel...

208
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,089
...stays on a path that
would make him proud.

209
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,348
So, what do you think
of all this?

210
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,560
I don't think anything, man.

211
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,355
I don't know a thing
about this newspaper.

212
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,483
I've never even read
a full edition of it.

213
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,236
You can do whatever the hell
you want with it.

214
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,739
I'm not the guy to run
The Sentinel.

215
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,545
Trying doesn't matter
when you always fail.

216
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,057
Where's my leaf?

217
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,485
Stupid bush.

218
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,824
Hello!

219
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,328
Who makes my coffee?!

220
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,665
Will someone explain to me why,
on the worst day of my life...

221
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,542
...my coffee tastes like shit?!

222
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,878
Your coffee is normally
made by Kato.

223
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,797
Who the hell is that?

224
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,967
He works on your father's cars
and makes his coffee.

225
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,136
You fired him and everyone who
works for your father yesterday.

226
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,013
I want Kato here now!

227
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,947
You're Kato?

228
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,784
I thought your name was Henry.
I thought the pool guy was Kato.

229
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,285
I'm Kato.

230
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,373
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

231
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,334
He was a complex man.

232
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,296
Yeah.

233
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,551
I have two questions for you, Kato.
Then you can go home.

234
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,178
Why is it that my dad's mechanic
makes the coffee?

235
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,848
And why is it that without you,
the coffee tastes...

236
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,807
...like crap?

237
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,767
I think it's easier if I show you.

238
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,938
Holy cow.

239
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,440
Where did you get that thing?

240
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,566
I made it.

241
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,567
Watch this.

242
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,776
You made that?

243
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,322
Sit with me, Kato.
Tell me your tale.

244
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,158
I was born in Shanghai.
You know Shanghai?

245
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,618
Love Japan.

246
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,120
My parents died when I was 4...

247
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,333
...and until I was 12
I lived in an orphanage.

248
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,003
I'm sorry. My mom died
when I was young too.

249
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,173
What happened after that?

250
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,717
Then me and a few friends
ran away.

251
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,011
- Lived on the street.
- How'd you start...

252
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,555
- ...working for my dad?
- I work in a garage.

253
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:23,017
And one day your father came in
with a '65 Chrysler.

254
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,602
I know the car well.

255
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,815
He was so happy with my work
that he offered me a job.

256
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,358
I said yes.

257
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,652
The coffee.
How'd that come about?

258
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,362
He used to always say:

259
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,532
"No one could ever make me
a good cup of coffee."

260
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,699
Good impression.

261
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,993
So I built him the coffee machine.

262
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,872
Well, you make one
damn fine cup of coffee, sir.

263
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,041
Wanna see something cool?

264
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,793
Yeah.

265
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,966
Not bad, man.

266
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,384
- You did that?
- Yep.

267
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,636
Industrial polycarbonate.

268
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,973
What the hell is industrial
polycarbonate?

269
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,350
It's the stuff...

270
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,727
...they use to make shark tanks.

271
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,398
What are you doing?
Put that away. Are you crazy?

272
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,566
Come on.

273
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,192
Don't be a pussy.

274
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,403
Okay.

275
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,072
What are you gonna do?

276
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,661
Dude.

277
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,831
That was awesome. What is that stuff?
How does that wo--?

278
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,583
Whoa, what are you
gonna do now?

279
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,792
And....

280
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,256
That is some Ben-Hurshit, dude.

281
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,007
Yeah.

282
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,510
Your dad made me do this kind
of stuff over the last few years.

283
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,056
That is the balls.

284
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,937
Old man was getting
paranoid, huh?

285
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:50,855
You like that?

286
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,940
- Yeah.
- Check this out.

287
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,825
You drew all these?

288
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,952
This is awesome.

289
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,537
Kato, you are...

290
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,788
...a really good drawer.

291
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,165
This is really impressive.

292
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,792
Thanks. That's the stuff
I would really like to do.

293
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,127
Holy--!

294
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,046
Kato, are you a pervert?

295
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,840
I wish I could draw stuff that sexy.

296
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,553
Beer?

297
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,805
Yeah, I'd love a beer. Sure.

298
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,611
Thank you.

299
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,079
Hey, Kato?

300
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,332
What did you think of my father?

301
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,625
He was fine.

302
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,836
Come on. Just tell me.

303
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,257
He was my boss.
Nobody loves their boss.

304
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,176
Don't sugar-coat this.
You're not going to offend me.

305
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,970
Just tell me, man to man.

306
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,640
He was a bit of a dick.

307
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,519
Yep.

308
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,357
You are--

309
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,526
Look at that.

310
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,653
I am genius.

311
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,321
- You are a genius.
- Yeah.

312
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,823
You're a mad genius.

313
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,283
I like classical music.

314
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,328
You're a genius who likes classical
music. You know what you are?

315
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,705
A human Swiss Army knife.

316
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,248
What's that mean?

317
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,750
It's a little thing,
you keep pulling out things.

318
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,211
When you think
there couldn't be any more...

319
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,297
...a new cool thing comes out.
That's you.

320
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,715
You even dress like one.

321
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,675
Just need a little plus
on your chest.

322
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,885
- Let's drink more.
- Yeah, let's drink.

323
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,264
Yeah.

324
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,058
You're speaking Chinese.

325
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,185
Oh, shit. Sorry.

326
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:57,356
I spent three weeks making a new
bumper for his Rolls-Royce.

327
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,693
And the day after I finished,
he crashed it.

328
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,448
He actually said it was my fault.
He screamed at me.

329
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,575
That sounds like him.

330
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,245
Listen to this, here's another story
of the 10 million I have.

331
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,914
I'm young, there's a--

332
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,917
Guys are picking on a girl
in school, I try to stop it.

333
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,169
I get in trouble.

334
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,420
What does my dad do?

335
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,674
He takes my favourite toy, and he rips
the head off of it! Right in front of me.

336
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,217
He throws it in the garbage.

337
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,179
I was trying to help!
That's all I was trying to do!

338
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,681
You know, it's unbelievable.

339
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,895
He's an ass his entire life and then,
you know, they build him a statue.

340
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,438
I just don't think....

341
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,859
People are gonna look at it
and think he's great but he's not.

342
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,694
It's totally unfair.

343
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,197
There's no justice.

344
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,285
Well, Kato?

345
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,623
What do you say we get ourselves
some goddamn justice, huh?

346
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,083
You serious?

347
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,292
I'm totally serious.

348
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,045
Let's do something crazy, man.
Let's do something nuts!

349
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,755
Let's just do it.

350
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,756
Yeah!

351
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,308
Let's roll, Kato.

352
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,158
Do you think it makes me
happy to do this, Dad?

353
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,756
Come here.

354
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,429
I know what you mean.

355
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,351
Oh, this looks ominous.

356
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,021
Where you going, man?

357
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,784
Oh, shit. Oh, no.

358
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,791
What do I do? What do I do?

359
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,543
Oh, God.

360
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,838
Hey! Leave them alone!

361
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,882
Let's get him!

362
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:28,883
Oh, shit!

363
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,301
I made a mistake!

364
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,891
Shit.

365
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,853
Guys, seriously! That's messed up!

366
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,812
Seriously!

367
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,360
No!

368
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,404
Okay. Okay. No.

369
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,198
I'm gonna give him a root canal.

370
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,199
Just cut him.

371
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,367
Get off, man! That's enough!

372
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,369
Open wi--

373
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,249
- You're a dead man!
- Come on, let's go!

374
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,708
Britt! Behind you!

375
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,175
Eat shit!

376
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,472
Kato, wait up!

377
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,643
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

378
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,479
Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Wait!

379
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,692
- Go, go, go.
- I'm in! I'm in! I'm in!

380
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,613
Oh, God! That was crazy!
I can't believe that!

381
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,658
Holy shit! Oh, my God, Kato.

382
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,126
Shit. Pigs.

383
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,919
Oh, no. Oh, no.

384
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,588
Are you a good driver?

385
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,964
You kidding me?

386
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,174
When I was a kid,
me and some friends--

387
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,676
Kato, not now. Just drive.

388
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,885
Okay, okay.

389
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,183
Just act cool.

390
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,519
- What do I do?
- Just act casual.

391
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,729
Pull it over! Now!

392
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,273
What are you doing?

393
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,608
I'm trying to lose him.

394
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,400
I don't know!

395
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,485
Man, now we're in a car chase!

396
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,738
Here he comes!

397
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,909
Show me your hands!

398
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,960
He's trying to kill us!

399
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,545
Do the Ben-Hurshit!

400
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,048
The Ben-Hurshit!

401
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,560
Oh, no.

402
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,737
Damn it.

403
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,573
Kato...

404
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,827
...I think this is the greatest
moment of my entire life.

405
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,871
I know. Mine too.

406
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,338
Yeah! We rule!

407
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,800
That was amazing!

408
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,559
We are awesome!

409
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,727
That was crazy!

410
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,814
How do you do that, dude?
You beat the crap out of those guys!

411
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,441
Where I grew up,
it was very dangerous.

412
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,403
I got in a lot of fights
when I was a kid.

413
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,863
But you knew where people
were without looking.

414
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,115
You were so fast.

415
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,452
When my heart starts pumping,
it's almost like time slows down.

416
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,705
It's unbelievable how cool we are!

417
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,207
Do you hear me, Dad? We did it!

418
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,792
That was amazing!

419
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,377
Kato, I'm serious.

420
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,632
I'm gonna get real with you,
so just go with this.

421
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,301
It might get weird and intimate...

422
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,886
...but just accept me, okay?

423
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:47,558
What we did tonight was fantastic.
It was amazing.

424
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,478
We saved those people, man.
We saved their lives!

425
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,606
So here's what I'm saying.
We keep doing this.

426
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,900
You can beat the crap
out of a million dudes...

427
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,778
...because you freeze time
when your heart starts pumping.

428
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,114
We do that every night,
I'm saying!

429
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,907
Kato? Kato?

430
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,788
We could be heroes

431
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:10,748
Hey, hey, hey.

432
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,832
Look, look.

433
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,251
We're on television!

434
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,587
We're on TV.

435
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,840
Look at me!

436
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,175
Where am I?

437
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,634
I don't know.

438
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,846
I'm too fast for TV.

439
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,514
Yes, exactly.

440
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,353
We saved those people and they
just talk about that stupid head.

441
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,690
How can we be heroes
if they think we're criminals?

442
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,526
The suspects are considered
armed and dangerous.

443
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:43,280
I am coming to you live from
Elysian Fields Cemetery....

444
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,032
Okay.

445
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,534
Think about this, Kato.

446
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:52,790
What is the one insanely stupid thing
every superhero has in common?

447
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,958
Tights?

448
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,168
No.

449
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,169
Cape?

450
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,545
No, Kato.

451
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:03,634
It's that everyone knows that they're
the good guy, the hero, you know?

452
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,720
All the bad guy has to do is
start capping innocent people...

453
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,389
...and he's got the good guy
by the nuts.

454
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,642
It's in every movie,
it's in every comic book.

455
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,894
It's in everything. It's so stupid.

456
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,562
But if the bad guy...

457
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,733
...thought the good guy was also a bad
guy, he wouldn't be able to do that.

458
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,361
That's what we'll do differently.
We will...

459
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,654
...pose as villains...

460
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,489
...but we'll act like heroes.

461
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,868
But then the police and the bad guys
will both try to kill us.

462
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,162
We're dead already, Kato.

463
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,082
I mean, seriously, look at us.

464
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,960
We've both been completely
wasting our potential.

465
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,920
You a little bit more than me.

466
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,589
What do you want your
autobiography to be called?

467
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,676
Oil Changes and Cappuccinos?

468
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:51,098
Because I think Balls Deep
in Shit-Kicking Dudes by Kato...

469
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,350
...is a much cooler-sounding book.

470
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,936
I would read that book,
and I don't read shit.

471
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,606
But when they adapted it into a movie,
I would see the shit out of it.

472
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,442
Kato, you should never make
coffee for anyone again.

473
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,944
It's a waste of your talent.

474
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,572
It's not dying that
you need to be afraid of.

475
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,449
It's never having lived
in the first place.

476
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,914
It did feel good
saving those people.

477
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,292
Well, technically, I saved them,
but you helped.

478
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,126
Whatever.

479
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,753
- Let's not get technical.
- But why would people...

480
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,798
...take us serious? We're just
two guys who stole a head.

481
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,640
I know how to make them
take us seriously.

482
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,443
All right, gentlemen. Hear ye, hear ye.
Court is in session.

483
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,653
Let's talk shop, okay?

484
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,905
Shall we?

485
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,824
Who's this guy?

486
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,618
Who's your friend?

487
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,912
- He's my man.
- I'm not your man.

488
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,332
He's not my man.
No. He's not my man.

489
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,168
He's like, you know, he's like
"my man." He's my--

490
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,337
Not-- We're plato-- It's plato--

491
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,631
We're platonic friends.
Platonic male friends.

492
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:06,924
He's my...

493
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,134
...executive associate.

494
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,846
Yes. That's who he is,
and that doesn't matter.

495
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,515
What does matter
is how we tackle...

496
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,142
...this horrible incident.

497
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,812
Whoever did this means business,
and this is just the beginning.

498
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,274
What are you talking about?
You mean the vandalising business?

499
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,609
I get it.

500
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,612
Listen, let's not blow this thing
out of proportion.

501
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,156
I will blow this guy
in any proportion I like.

502
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,199
This is my...

503
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,702
...newspaper, Axford, and I want
this man on the front page of it.

504
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,373
I want him on the webpage.
I want you to blog about him.

505
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,875
I want him on every
news outlet we have.

506
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,502
I want the whole city to know...

507
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,379
...how dangerous this man is.

508
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,297
The man that cut the head off...

509
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,175
...of my father's statue. Not yours.

510
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,636
All right.

511
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,598
Since there isn't any real info
on the guy's identity...

512
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,559
...what do we call him?

513
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,989
That's easy.

514
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,615
I got it.

515
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,411
This man is called...

516
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,913
...the Green Bee.

517
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,503
It's kind of lame.

518
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,213
It sounds like a knitting store.

519
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,132
It sounds like an energy bar.

520
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,593
No, that came out wrong. That's not
what I meant. I didn't mean that!

521
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,554
I like The Decapitator.

522
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,306
Well, then make it like
the Green Desecrater.

523
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,183
What's the guy
that drives the horse?

524
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,518
Or Green Trenchcoat Guy.

525
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,894
The Green Hornet.

526
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,271
No. It's more like--

527
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,772
- What?
- What did--?

528
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,441
The Green Hornet.

529
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,444
That's pretty awesome.

530
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,611
Much better.

531
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,072
- You guys like that?
- Yeah, your man's right.

532
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,949
- Green Hornet it is.
- Looks good too.

533
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,036
- The Green Hornet. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine.

534
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,746
It's decided, then.

535
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,789
The front page of
tomorrow's newspaper...

536
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,293
...will feature the Green Hornet.
Unless you like Green Bee better?

537
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,294
Anyone? No one?

538
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,587
Oh, that's much worse.

539
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,297
- Definitely Hornet.
- Okay, fine.

540
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,215
Let's roll, Kato.

541
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,803
So Green Hornet des-- Oh, no, not
"desecrates." How about decapitates?

542
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,472
It's gonna be a long night.

543
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,156
I am.

544
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,787
We need to think of
a cool name for you.

545
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:42,996
The Lil' Stinger!

546
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm the Green Hornet,
you're Lil' Stinger!

547
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,249
No way.

548
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,502
The Honey Pot.

549
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,254
Get it? Like, bees make honey?
You're my Honey Pot.

550
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,341
What's going on?

551
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:02,099
Decapitated statues.
I decapitated real people.

552
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,184
No, no. I wouldn't worry about it.

553
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,603
He won't affect business.

554
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,314
I'm not worried.

555
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,025
Who told you I'm worried?

556
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,318
DA Scanlon!

557
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,530
With the nightclub bombing,
and now this Green Hornet guy...

558
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,366
...some saying the streets
might not be as safe as you say.

559
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,370
Look, guys, stop connecting separate
thoughts with invisible lines.

560
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,123
This Green Hornet thing
is just a prank.

561
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,084
What you guys should report
is that since I took office...

562
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,379
...crime is down significantly
in the city of Los Angeles.

563
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,713
Thank you.

564
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,994
- Hi.
- Hi.

565
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,662
I'm Lenore Case.

566
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,999
I'm the temp for Mr. Reid's
secretarial position.

567
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,542
Today's my first day.

568
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:14,337
Oh, nice to meet you. I'm Kato.

569
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,839
It's my first day too.

570
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,175
Really? Well, nice to meet you.

571
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,718
Do you work for Mr. Reid?

572
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,095
I'm his executive associate.

573
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,097
That must be great.

574
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,933
Yeah, it is. So far.

575
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,061
I have a really important question.

576
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:34,274
Who is the hottie-boom-bottie who's
standing right behind me right now?

577
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,235
I'm kidding. Hi, I'm Britt Reid.
I own this newspaper.

578
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,238
- What's going on?
- It's such a pleasure. I'm Lenore Case.

579
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,283
I've been sent to be your temp
until you find a new secretary.

580
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,120
Jackpot.

581
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,788
Right this way.

582
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,207
So...

583
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,125
...got one.

584
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,460
Why don't you tell me:

585
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,297
How do you feel about
the state of this...

586
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,715
...newspaper...

587
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,926
...as it stands today.

588
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,302
Go.

589
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,138
To be honest,
this paper has taken a dip...

590
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,599
...in the last few years
in quality and ambition.

591
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,558
Really?

592
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,393
Well, the entire industry has...

593
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,145
...because of the Internet.

594
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,649
So there's a lot of pressure to print
easy-to-digest articles.

595
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:16,775
And it's the last...

596
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,028
...family-owned paper in the city,
one of the only not attached...

597
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,656
...to a conglomerate,
so it's understandable.

598
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,615
Conglomerate?

599
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,159
The Sentinel used to really
use its independence...

600
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,953
...to be brazen, at the very least.

601
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,830
Like that article your father wrote
just after the bombing?

602
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,501
That was reporting. That is the kind
of article that can make a difference.

603
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,838
That was good. You know
a lot about this shit, huh?

604
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,008
I studied journalism.
I have a minor in criminology.

605
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,677
- Really?
- Yeah.

606
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,638
Criminology.
The study of the criminal mind.

607
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,847
What are your...

608
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,976
...thoughts on this
Green Hornet character? Go.

609
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,646
Well, first, there's two kinds
of criminals.

610
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,273
There's the psycho egomaniac...

611
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,691
...and the power maniac.

612
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,276
He seems to be the second.

613
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,902
- English.
- He defied authority--

614
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,362
What will he do next?

615
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,114
Yeah.

616
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,950
What is his next move,
is what I was gonna ask.

617
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,493
Write this down.

618
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,037
Well, he'll probably try to...

619
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,372
...appropriate more power.

620
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,708
He'll hit somebody
on their own turf.

621
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,378
Basically, he'll start out small, and
then he'll work his way up to the top.

622
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,381
I mean, that's what John Gotti did
to Paul Castellano in '85.

623
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,383
- And it worked?
- Yes.

624
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:25,719
Look at you!

625
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,804
You really know a lot
about this stuff.

626
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,806
And you're lovely
and beautiful and--

627
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,977
I'm just sitting here thinking, "Why
are you only pursuing this in your...?"

628
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,230
Kato, help me out here.

629
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,565
Twilight?

630
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,527
"Twilight"?

631
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,570
Yeah.

632
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,573
I saw the movie,
but I don't see how this is--

633
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,576
Oh, no, no, no. Not like that.
No. Not like the movie.

634
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,788
I guess if we're doing movies,
it would be more like Cocoon...

635
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,915
...or something like that.

636
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,335
Yeah. Later in one's years.

637
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,086
What are you--? I'm only 36.

638
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,338
You're 36?

639
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,922
Holy shit. That's crazy.

640
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,841
Thought you were, like, 31, tops.

641
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,135
I don't even know if we
can hire a 36-year-old.

642
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,428
We have to build a ramp.

643
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:10,597
Why now?

644
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,098
She doesn't wanna tell you.

645
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,184
You don't know what
you're talking about.

646
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,435
Mr. Kato is right.

647
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,270
I do not feel comfortable.

648
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,441
And if this means I am not going to be
your temp any longer, I'm sorry. It's--

649
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,234
That's exactly what it means.

650
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,446
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

651
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,699
Because you are now
my permanent secretary!

652
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,410
Here is what has
gone down, Lenore.

653
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,954
You've displayed two things.

654
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,122
Balls.

655
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,875
And if there's one thing
I like on my women...

656
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,960
...it's balls.

657
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,295
Be my permanent secretary.

658
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,463
Are you kidding me?

659
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,298
I'm not kidding. This is how I do.

660
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,425
This is how I roll,
every day, all day.

661
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,636
I make it rain like this, okay?

662
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,054
Come work for me.

663
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,473
- Just say yes. Don't think.
- Really?

664
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,225
- I'll do it. Yes!
- Thank you. Yes!

665
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,143
- This is so exciting.
- It is exciting.

666
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,062
- Thank you so much.
- Don't thank him.

667
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,397
- Thank you.
- Yes.

668
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,982
- I will not disappoint you.
- I don't think you will.

669
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,236
I will do in-depth research,
fact checking, spell checking.

670
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,487
Anything that you need.

671
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,241
Why don't you get started on more
Green Hornet research? Perfect.

672
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,161
She is hot. It's crazy how
hot she is. It's sickening.

673
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,913
Did you write down everything?

674
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,123
Let me see!

675
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,125
Pervert.

676
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,836
Let's get to work, Kato.

677
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,423
All right, we got a plan.
Start small...

678
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,591
- ...work our way up to the top.
- Okay.

679
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,677
We'll need a car.

680
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,011
Yes, we'll need a car.

681
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,304
With some weapons.

682
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,098
And armour.

683
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,850
Cool rims. Spinning rims.

684
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,017
Slurpee machine.

685
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,769
A horn that plays "La Cucaracha."

686
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,688
Loaded up the ass with cool shit!

687
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,022
I can do that.

688
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,024
Kato, I want you to take my hand...

689
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,318
...and come with me
on this adventure.

690
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,447
I'll go with you,
but I don't wanna touch you.

691
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,700
Don't take my hand, but will you
come with me on this adventure?

692
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,639
No.

693
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,486
I'll pick this one.

694
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,322
All right. This one.

695
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,492
Tell me what's going down, girl.

696
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,080
Hey, Kato!

697
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,499
Come closer.

698
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,375
I had an idea for the car.

699
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,586
Ejector seats.

700
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,087
Ejector seats?

701
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,048
You don't think it's a good idea?

702
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,093
- Hi.
- Hi.

703
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,424
I'm so excited right now.

704
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,468
I can't wait!

705
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,641
Oh, man. What the hell?

706
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,184
Watch your feet.

707
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,062
I call it the Black Beauty.

708
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,064
Kato!

709
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,400
It's beautiful!

710
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,319
And it's black.

711
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,698
Incredible.

712
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,833
Dude, we're forgetting
something important.

713
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,752
Watch this.

714
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,217
That is so wicked.

715
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,001
Where we going?

716
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,045
I have no idea. I thought you knew.

717
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,797
Oh, okay, I got an idea. Okay.

718
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,510
Mr. Reid's office.

719
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,387
I'm looking at you.

720
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,221
What?

721
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,389
I'm totally joking.

722
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,058
Britt Reid calling.

723
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,894
Burning the candle at both ends,
I see.

724
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,731
Wouldn't Mr. Case
be upset with that?

725
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,484
There is no Mr. Case?

726
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,402
Well, that's not why I'm calling.

727
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,073
Remember we asked you to do
all that Green Hornet research?

728
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,866
Predicting what he might do next?

729
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,077
If you could send us that?
Those crime maps.

730
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,245
- Oh, yeah.
- That'd be helpful. Fax it over.

731
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,413
Hold on a second.

732
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,374
Let me see.
It's coming right at you.

733
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:30,667
Great.

734
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,418
So, what you doing? Just--?

735
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,504
If you need anything else,
let me know.

736
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,214
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Bye-bye.

737
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,676
She wants me so bad...

738
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,593
...it's crazy.

739
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,057
Here we go.

740
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,100
South Central.

741
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,768
Yeah. Okay. We got...

742
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,269
...14 homicides...

743
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:53,398
...34 assaults, 116 drug arrests.

744
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,732
This month.

745
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,527
A good place for
the Green Hornet to make his debut.

746
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,113
- Let's roll, Kato.
- Let's roll.

747
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,285
This is really far east.

748
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,413
I've never been to this part of town.

749
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,125
I think we're in the hood, Kato.

750
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,878
Britt, Britt! Do you think...

751
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,088
...we start with them?

752
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,881
Yeah. Just like Lenore said.

753
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,134
Start small, work our way up.

754
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,969
This is really, really intense.

755
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,595
- You don't want to do it?
- I do.

756
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,764
Let's do it before
we chicken out, okay?

757
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,975
- I won't chicken out.
- Who knows who might?

758
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,143
Just pull up to them.

759
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,310
I don't want to talk.

760
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,063
- Well, I don't want to talk either.
- So get in the back!

761
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,150
- I barely speak English.
- You're speaking English now!

762
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,902
Okay, fine! Oh, this is so stupid.

763
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,070
Okay.

764
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,406
- Calm down.
- I am calm. This is scary.

765
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,658
- Shut up.
- You shut up. Just let me talk.

766
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,660
- Be cool, be cool.
- I am cool. Shut up.

767
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,998
Yo, you looking for
that good stuff, man?

768
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,917
I am the Green Hornet.

769
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,170
And I would like to sit
down with your boss.

770
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,337
Sit on this, bitch.

771
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:02,925
Oh, God!

772
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:04,886
My arm!

773
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,898
Bean bags! Kato, hit them
with the bean bags!

774
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,488
Yeah!

775
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,031
Let me show you
how it's done!

776
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:27,492
Green...

777
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,701
...Hornet...

778
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:29,911
...says hello!

779
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,227
Eat my foot...

780
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,561
...bitch!

781
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,897
My nuts!

782
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,240
What the hell was that?

783
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,994
Who do you work fo--?

784
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,538
Oh, God. Gross.

785
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,583
Who do you work for?

786
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,919
Shit. Hey! You!

787
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,420
Come here! Come here!

788
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,880
Hey! Who do you work for?

789
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:23,756
Chudnofsky.

790
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,216
Guy everybody works for.

791
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,050
Chov-what-sky?

792
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,176
Chudnofsky.

793
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,012
What kind of a dumb name is that?

794
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,765
- Where do you get the shit you sell?
- I won't tell you.

795
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,433
Oh, really? Never?

796
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,855
Chudnofsky's on our ass, guys.

797
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,773
We gotta get this shipment done.

798
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,616
You've just been stung!

799
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,993
Yeah!

800
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,994
You!

801
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,288
This is my town now!

802
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,790
My name is the Green Hornet.

803
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,126
Cool, man. Nice to meet you.

804
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,044
Cool. How's it going?

805
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,380
Anyway, tell your boss...

806
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,675
...the Green Hornet
sends his regards.

807
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,676
Dude.

808
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,889
You broke my lab, man.

809
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:13,723
Yeah.

810
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,516
I'm sorry about that.

811
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,730
Let's burn this mother down, Kato.

812
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,374
Explain yourself, Mr. Tupper.

813
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:45,004
The guy was crazy, man. I mean,
he drove a car through a wall.

814
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,131
The thing looked like a half-tank.

815
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,050
There was fire
coming out of the thing.

816
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,509
And?

817
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,762
Oh, yeah, he gave me this.

818
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,016
He said that this is his town now.

819
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,355
A man comes in in an insect
costume and you shit your pants?

820
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,523
Look, trust me!

821
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,234
A grown man wearing a mask...

822
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:10,029
...is a little bit scarier
than a guy wearing a suit.

823
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:21,082
You're not pleased with my suit?
Does it fail to fill you with fear?

824
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,462
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
any disrespect.

825
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,924
Do you have any idea how many great
people have killed in a suit?!

826
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,552
I like your suit.

827
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,720
Me too.

828
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,931
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

829
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,893
I'm not as scary as some idiot
in a green mask. Come on!

830
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,771
You say they won't affect business.

831
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,398
Now, this guy ran six...

832
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,441
...of the biggest meth labs in L.A.

833
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,443
Now because of that Hornet,
he's dead.

834
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,154
Business affected.

835
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,241
I've got reports of the Green Hornet
shooting out a camera....

836
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,827
I had a report that
an elderly couple claims...

837
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,954
...he gave the finger
from the HOV Lane.

838
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,165
--that saw the Green Hornet
and his chauffeur in a fistfight...

839
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,751
...with gang members
in South Central.

840
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,546
The Green Hornet raises questions.
We all know that...

841
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,965
...gang proliferation
has been rising.

842
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,675
Okay, that'll be homework.

843
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,135
I got a yoga class.

844
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:18,264
Don't worry. Anyhoo, bottom line:
Headlines, people.

845
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,766
Get this story out there.

846
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,811
Will the violence continue
to spill out onto the street?

847
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,105
What are the police
doing about it?

848
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,357
Is anyone safe...

849
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,859
...at the mercy of...

850
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,444
...dot, dot, dot...

851
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,611
...the Green Hornet?

852
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,322
And I want those dots.
I want dots in the paper, okay?

853
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,949
Want us to handle this delicately?

854
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,576
No.

855
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:42,413
But DA Scanlon's re-election platform
is based on cleaning up the streets.

856
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,040
You guys are acquaintances.

857
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,542
- So if you want us to--
- That's a great idea.

858
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,668
You should use that.

859
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,295
Write an article about that!

860
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:53,174
"Even DA Scanlon is quivering
at the feet of this scourge."

861
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,717
Use the word "scourge."

862
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,635
- Write an article about that.
- Britt.

863
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,637
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, yeah.

864
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:02,683
I know what you're trying to do, turn
this newspaper into a discotheque.

865
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:03,976
But it's not gonna work.

866
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,312
That's not what I'm doing.
She's a brainy broad.

867
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,022
This is a serious matter, okay?

868
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,191
Every line we print,
there's repercussions.

869
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,693
Somebody has to take
responsibility. That's me.

870
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,988
Well, I'm not afraid of these bastards
and you shouldn't be either.

871
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:17,907
Neither was Daniel.

872
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,325
He made it to the wall.

873
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,244
They killed him for wantonly
speculating on the drug war.

874
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,831
That's exactly what you and your
little girlfriend are doing.

875
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,334
I know you think my experience
ain't worth shit...

876
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,753
...but your father listened to me.
So should you.

877
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,089
This is the story I want to run.

878
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:37,051
I'm going with it,
and if he were still with us, it's what...

879
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,263
...Daniel Vertell.... Vertellah?

880
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,060
Vertalot. It's what he would've
wanted too. Okay?

881
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,271
That's the story, team. Run it!

882
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,398
Britt Reid outro.

883
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,541
"Scourge"?

884
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,257
--tail on this Hornet guy!

885
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,200
Yeah!

886
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,577
Red light. Stop!

887
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,078
Shit, the camera got us.

888
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,252
What camera?

889
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,549
The Green Hornet
and his masked accomplice...

890
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,843
...stirred up trouble in
the southland today.

891
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,304
Violence has erupted downtown....

892
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,601
- Kato? Breakfast in the house.
- Yes.

893
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,311
I just checked the Hornet mail.

894
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,813
Nothing new,
but they'll be a-knocking.

895
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,440
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

896
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,819
- I have something for you.
- Really? Awesome.

897
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,118
"Dear Britt, you are my shon-di."

898
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,119
What's shon-di?

899
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,287
Brother.

900
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,623
That's awfully nice.

901
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,501
I've never had a brother, man.
I always wanted one.

902
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,550
What the hell is this?

903
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,511
It's a gas gun. Your Hornet gun!

904
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,055
- A gas gun?
- Yeah.

905
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,349
Why not a "gun" gun?

906
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,975
Our enemies have "gun" guns.

907
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,311
What? I don't understand.
What are these?

908
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,980
What is this? What are these?
Are these paint balls?

909
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,149
No. Inside is knockout gas.

910
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,651
That's insane.

911
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,486
Where's yours? Do you have one?

912
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,155
- Do you have a black version of it?
- No, just you.

913
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,157
- No?
- No.

914
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,825
Well, why not? Why just me?

915
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,328
You are so special.

916
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,872
I know, but how come
I'm the only one with a gun?

917
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,915
You don't have...

918
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,876
...much fighting experience,
so I thought you needed a gun.

919
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,546
Well, I'll be honest,
that's a little insulting, man.

920
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,548
We were both badasses
the other night.

921
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,677
I kicked that guy in the face
like three times. In the face.

922
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,095
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

923
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,513
Yeah.

924
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,056
It makes you look cool.

925
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,183
I need to look cool now?
What the hell?

926
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,685
You said my outfit was pimp.

927
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,854
I thought, "That's a weird word."
But you said it was pimp.

928
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,356
- It is pimp.
- Yeah.

929
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,525
The Hornet gun
is just an accessory.

930
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,693
- An accessory?
- Yeah.

931
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,904
Well, then you need
nunchucks, then.

932
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,116
- If you don't like it, don't use it.
- How does it work?

933
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:48,534
Shit!

934
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,369
Hey.

935
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,204
Hey, hey, hey.

936
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,373
Okay. It works.

937
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,050
What the hell?

938
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,304
Kato!

939
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,471
I'm here!

940
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,559
Hey, you're awake.

941
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,062
What the hell? What happened to me?
What's happening? What happened?

942
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,898
You shot yourself in the face
by mistake.

943
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,068
How long was I out?
What time is it?

944
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,486
Two o'clock.

945
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,488
Oh, that's not so bad, I guess.

946
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,741
On Thursday.

947
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,910
It's Thursday? Are you ki--?
It's not Monday right now?

948
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,120
No. I'm sorry.

949
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,296
Did you put this diaper on me?

950
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,927
Well, what did I miss?

951
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,095
Nothing really.

952
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,556
I did some work on
the Black Beauties.

953
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,766
"Beauties"?

954
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,435
Holy crap.

955
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,187
Backups.

956
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,689
How the hell did you do this
in four days?

957
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,399
It's been 11 days.

958
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,863
Whoa, 11 days? What?!
Are you kidding me?

959
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,616
I wasn't sleeping,
I was in a coma, dick!

960
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,118
But it's okay now,
I fixed the Hornet gas.

961
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,496
The gas only lasts one hour.

962
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,789
Can I see it?

963
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,791
Okay, but be careful
this time. Okay?

964
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,919
I just want to look at it.
Just give it to me for one second....

965
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,341
See you in an hour.

966
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,675
Mr. Reid!

967
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,802
Hey.

968
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,513
Welcome back. I'm so glad
you're feeling better.

969
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,515
I heard that mono was the worst.

970
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:35,808
Mono?

971
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,312
Yeah, well,
it's better than herpes, right?

972
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,482
Here are your messages.
I have some meetings...

973
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,651
- ...I'd like to set up with you.
- Cool.

974
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,985
Knock that off.

975
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,364
Here is the research that you
asked for before you got sick.

976
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,408
Green Hornet! Me likey!

977
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,661
DA Scanlon called, he said that
he really needs to speak to you.

978
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,453
Boring!

979
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,497
I need to go look at this stuff.

980
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,049
I read the article you sent me.

981
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,509
What are you doing tonight?

982
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,677
- Nothing.
- No?

983
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,719
Nothing at all.

984
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:16,682
Thought maybe we could get dinner
or get a drink, blow off some steam.

985
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,184
Yeah. I would love to.

986
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,520
- What time?
- I was thinking 7?

987
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,896
We could meet downstairs.

988
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,524
Seven.

989
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,779
- Perfect. I'll be there.
- Okay.

990
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,200
That was awesome!

991
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,244
Hey, Kato!

992
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,538
Can you make me some coffee?

993
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,877
You don't have your whole
little operation set up...

994
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,045
...but whatever you whip up
would be great.

995
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,380
Lenore...

996
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,966
...have you had this
little bastard's coffee?

997
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,009
Because it is...

998
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,344
...scrump-diddly-umptious.
You want a cup?

999
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,471
I'm fine, thank you.

1000
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,306
So that's just one...

1001
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,557
...cup of coffee, Kato.

1002
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,895
So there's this restaurant that just
opened in the San Fernando Valley...

1003
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:06,940
...and it's called
La Maison des la Voide.

1004
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,735
The whole thing is you eat
your meal in total darkness.

1005
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,069
So with deprived sight...

1006
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:14,323
...each bite is like an orgasm
in your mouth.

1007
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,408
And I was thinking
maybe it would be...

1008
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,243
- Mr. Reid's office.
- ...fun if....

1009
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,787
This is DA Scanlon calling
for Britt Reid, please.

1010
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,915
Hello, sir.
I'm aware you've been calling.

1011
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,750
No, he's had mono.

1012
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,086
Let me look. Maybe there's a chance
we could work that out today.

1013
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,426
If you ever tell me
to get you coffee again...

1014
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,178
...I'll beat the shit out of you!

1015
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,972
What are you--? What is wrong
with you? Are you crazy?

1016
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,808
This is our plan,
you're supposed to work for me!

1017
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,435
You got me a Jamba Juice!

1018
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,354
We're supposed to be
brothers, man.

1019
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,439
We're supposed to be shon-di!

1020
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,441
What happened to that, huh?

1021
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,776
I'm sorry.

1022
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,361
You should be sorry.

1023
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,781
We've become superheroes
and there's a lot of stress involved...

1024
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,075
...but you don't gotta
freak out about it.

1025
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,118
Now can I have the coffee?

1026
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,579
I'm joking. I'm totally joking.

1027
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,498
You still mad at me, Kato?

1028
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,707
No.

1029
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,875
Good.

1030
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,794
Because you shouldn't be anyway.

1031
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,254
What's up with Lenore, man?

1032
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,005
Is she acting weird around me?

1033
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,298
No, why?

1034
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,466
I "like" like her.

1035
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,469
And I can't nail her.
She's completely un-nailable.

1036
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,138
It's a terrible fact.
I don't know what to do.

1037
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,808
She doesn't like you,
why would you want her?

1038
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,811
Maybe it's because she doesn't
like me. Isn't that sick?

1039
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,312
That could be it.

1040
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:31,483
Girls are such a drag, Kato.
Thank God we have each other.

1041
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,654
Hey! I'm calling a boys' night!
What do you say, huh?

1042
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,822
What are you doing?

1043
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,993
I didn't know you wanted to hang out.
I'm going for drinks with a friend.

1044
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,495
Friend? Who? Come on.

1045
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,247
Tony.

1046
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,498
Tony?

1047
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,710
Well, have fun!

1048
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,837
Hey, wait, wait, wait! Can I come?

1049
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,177
- You want to try?
- No.

1050
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,721
Hit the black key.

1051
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,514
- Really?
- Yeah.

1052
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,182
Okay, I'll try. Which one?

1053
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:19,239
You know, this Green Hornet thing
is just crazy, isn't it?

1054
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,575
I mean, it's all I can think about
sometimes.

1055
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,455
I feel really in tuned with it. Kind of
like that guy with the Zodiac Killer.

1056
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,707
What about the man
dressed in black?

1057
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,084
Johnny Cash?

1058
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,919
No. His partner.

1059
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,423
His partner. No, I don't think
that that's his partner.

1060
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,550
That's probably just
some thug he hired.

1061
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,053
Anyhow, they'll both
be dead in no time.

1062
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,721
Yeah.

1063
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,640
Why?

1064
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,893
Because the Green Hornet's been
attracting way too much attention.

1065
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,646
Whoever's in charge
is gonna get tired of it...

1066
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,065
...call him in to make a deal,
then kill him.

1067
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:55,692
It's what Gotti did
to Mangela in '87.

1068
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,612
In two weeks. Two weeks, tops,
that's what I give them.

1069
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,072
- Two weeks?
- Dead.

1070
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,660
You're not gonna like this,
but we got nothing.

1071
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,079
It's like the Green Hornet
didn't exist.

1072
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,747
Nobody's done a deal with him...

1073
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:09,998
...done time with him.

1074
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,249
Nobody's heard of him.

1075
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,251
It's like he came out of thin air.

1076
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,462
Yeah, and I've gotta say...

1077
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:18,465
...he's setting a bad example
for the other gangs.

1078
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,342
I met with the Armenians today.

1079
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,345
They told me if the Hornet
is independent...

1080
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,806
...they wanna be independent too.

1081
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,266
The Armenians truly said that?

1082
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,728
And I heard rumours the Koreans
are talking the same.

1083
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,146
Which Korean?

1084
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,773
Kim.

1085
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,610
Kim?

1086
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,197
No, Kim never said that.

1087
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,283
No, we've been doing business
for 25 years. We're friends.

1088
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,619
I'm sorry, boss.

1089
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,371
That's just shocking.

1090
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,124
Maybe we should go down there
and teach them...

1091
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,709
...to keep their mouths shut.

1092
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:54,459
No.

1093
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,002
No. No.

1094
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,297
I should kill Kim myself.
He's a friend.

1095
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:03,218
And I'll kill the Armenians too.
It'll make me feel better.

1096
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,261
Wait! Wait!

1097
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,265
Great. What about The Hornet?

1098
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,565
Britt?

1099
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,484
What you doing here?

1100
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,195
Guess what, you son of a bitch.

1101
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,907
We got mail.

1102
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:29,327
We got Hornet mail!
He e-mailed! It happened!

1103
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,706
Come here, look! Come here!
Look, look, look!

1104
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,584
"Green Hornet." Me.

1105
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,335
"Good job on the meth lab.

1106
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,881
The place was costing me money
and I wanted to shut it down."

1107
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:41,882
That's B.S.

1108
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:45,260
"Let's talk about another venture
that could be mutually beneficial.

1109
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,513
Please meet tomorrow
at the lot on Fifth and Union...

1110
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,807
...in downtown at 4 p.m."

1111
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,935
Another adventure for
the Green Hornet...

1112
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,354
...and his nameless sidekick!

1113
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,526
Looks like we've got
some planning to do.

1114
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,403
It could be a trap.

1115
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,865
Like how Gotti killed
Mangela in '87.

1116
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,201
Where did you hear that from?

1117
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,329
The History Channel.

1118
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:13,538
Oh, yeah?

1119
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,457
Should we go downtown now...

1120
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,792
...and check it out?

1121
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,794
No, that's cool. I got that covered.

1122
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,087
You fill up the car
with weapons and stuff.

1123
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:25,342
So you're just gonna come up
with the plan by yourself?

1124
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,052
Bingo.

1125
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,596
I don't know if that's the best idea.

1126
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,473
- Course you don't.
- What's that mean?

1127
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,726
Oh, it means that you think
you're an awesome karate dude...

1128
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,813
...that can do anything, and that
I'm an incompetent schmuck...

1129
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,398
...who needs a gun
that shoots farts at people.

1130
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,484
I'm saying,
we should do this together.

1131
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,152
I'm saying you should go home.

1132
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:48,907
You should go to sleep so tomorrow
you could process my incredible plan.

1133
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,743
Fine.

1134
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,414
This is so stupid.

1135
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,583
We pissed this guy off.

1136
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,377
Now we're walking into his turf.

1137
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,879
We walked into their turf last time
and guess what.

1138
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,756
We kicked the crap out of them.

1139
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,843
And everyone knows: what happens
when you corner a hornet?

1140
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,094
You get stung.

1141
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,179
"You get stung."
What does that mean?

1142
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,724
This is not a game, Britt.
And you're gonna get us killed.

1143
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:18,436
If you don't like my plan,
you do not have to be a part of it.

1144
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,647
- I don't think you have a plan.
- I do!

1145
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,232
I just haven't told you yet.

1146
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,401
And it's amazing, okay?

1147
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,279
So are you in, or are you
chickening out like a bitch?

1148
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,613
You are a bitch.

1149
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,949
Not now, Kato, not now.
Turn in here.

1150
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,124
There they are.
Game faces, Kato. Game faces.

1151
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,420
Here's the plan.
Take this, put it in your ear.

1152
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,213
You listen in on my phone...

1153
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,882
...which I've taped to my chest.

1154
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:50,260
When I say the secret word,
which is "Constantinople"...

1155
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,763
...I'll kick the old guy in the nuts,
you blow them up with missiles.

1156
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:56,057
Truck! Kato, back up!

1157
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,309
Back up! Back up!

1158
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:58,977
Okay, okay, okay.

1159
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,480
This is not part of the plan!

1160
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:03,398
No shit!

1161
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:18,079
And so thunder strikes lightning.

1162
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,085
Okay, don't panic!

1163
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,173
The worst thing we can do
right now is panic.

1164
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,966
Just let me think.

1165
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,683
Okay, don't worry.
I'll get us out of here, okay?

1166
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:41,519
No, you won't! We're gonna
die now, you ass-wipe.

1167
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,189
Well, with that attitude we will!
Come on, man!

1168
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,112
- I think I'm claustrophobic!
- Let me think.

1169
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:51,821
Oh, no!

1170
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,240
- I can't breathe!
- Listen, listen.

1171
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,038
We're buried!
We are totally buried!

1172
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,957
Okay, okay.

1173
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,541
What are you doing?

1174
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,294
Either killing us or saving us.

1175
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,881
Missiles armed?
That's your plan? You'll blow us up.

1176
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,633
That's not a good plan!

1177
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,051
Disarm them, man!

1178
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,678
Shall we part?

1179
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,180
Feel like kebabs for dinner?

1180
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:23,979
Look out!

1181
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,193
Chili!

1182
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,405
They killed him! They killed Chili!

1183
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:43,873
Run!

1184
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,258
Oh, shit.

1185
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,301
- There's thorns in these bushes!
- Shut up!

1186
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,344
Shut up!

1187
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,849
This thing has no aim!

1188
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:01,933
It sucks!

1189
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,435
You have no aim!

1190
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:07,439
Britt!

1191
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,531
What?

1192
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,626
I smash window, you shoot in.

1193
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,628
Every man for himself!

1194
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,055
Go away!

1195
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,390
Die!

1196
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:43,725
Oh, shit!

1197
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,460
So you just gonna
ignore me now, is that it?

1198
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,128
Like a baby?

1199
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,964
And go home,
eat some baby food maybe?

1200
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,633
Drink some milk?

1201
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:20,261
Why don't you talk like a baby.
Mama, goo-goo. You baby.

1202
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,188
Baby.

1203
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,194
Explosives were triggered
from that vehicle, destroying it...

1204
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,113
- ...freeing the Green Hornet....
- Dickweed.

1205
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,825
You're calling me that too?
I know people call me that.

1206
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,993
That's not a surprise.
That's not a mystery.

1207
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,203
Why not?

1208
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:47,664
You say rude things to me
all day, every day.

1209
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,207
That's not how partners work.

1210
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,542
We're not partners.

1211
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:54,712
I'm the hero, you're my sidekick!
That's what this is.

1212
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,714
I'm Indy, you're Short Round!

1213
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:59,217
Simon, Garfunkel!

1214
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,719
Scooby, Doo!

1215
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,556
Stop fooling yourself.
Green Hornet is nothing without me.

1216
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:08,226
I made the knockout gas. I alone
designed and built the Black Beauty.

1217
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,520
And I didn't help at all?

1218
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,230
How? Ejector seats?

1219
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:13,523
Exactly.

1220
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,692
What a great idea.

1221
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,236
You may have started
this Green Hornet thing...

1222
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,238
...because you hated your father.

1223
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:23,199
- You're an egomaniac.
- I know.

1224
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:25,910
Exactly like your father.

1225
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:30,665
You are a jealous,
pathetic little man!

1226
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,042
Fine. You're doing great
with Lenore.

1227
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:34,919
What the hell does that mean?

1228
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,338
Don't you walk away on that!

1229
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,924
What, you're charming her
pants off, that's what...

1230
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,426
...I'm supposed to believe?

1231
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,929
No, that is a filthy gesture!

1232
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,181
You know I like her!

1233
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,932
I confided in you, Kato!

1234
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,268
I trusted you!
I told you I liked her!

1235
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,854
Stop it! You hit on
everything that moves.

1236
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,106
I'm amazed you haven't...

1237
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:56,399
...hit on me yet.

1238
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,612
If you keep talking like this, Kato...

1239
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,614
...I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you.

1240
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,533
- Just so you know.
- I'd like to see you try.

1241
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,076
You are a yuppie wimp...

1242
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:10,538
...and I'm a martial arts expert who
grew up penniless on the streets.

1243
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,916
You grew up penis-less
on the streets.

1244
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,459
Funny!

1245
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,961
Heroes beat sidekicks, period!

1246
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,463
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

1247
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,797
I'm warning you.

1248
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,471
Okay, I'm gonna forget that slap...

1249
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:27,931
...so we can fix this.

1250
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:30,308
Okay, okay, you're right.
You're right.

1251
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,936
Let's talk. I'm sorry.

1252
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,232
Sacked you like a bitch, Kato!

1253
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:44,030
Come here! Chop-chop!

1254
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,328
You like that, Kato? You like it?
This is what you get...

1255
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,413
...when you corner a hornet!

1256
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,665
You get--

1257
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,166
Oh, God!

1258
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,424
Now I'm gonna hurt you.

1259
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,093
I'd like to see you try.

1260
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,933
Get this stupid thing off me...

1261
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,268
...you cheating bastard!

1262
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,857
You dirty bastard!

1263
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:35,707
You idiot.

1264
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,500
Okay, let's--

1265
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,712
Can we end this?

1266
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,803
You are so stubborn.

1267
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,070
Do you like it? You like it?

1268
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:07,530
No, I don't like it!

1269
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:08,906
You like it? You like it?

1270
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:09,949
I don't like it.

1271
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,336
Okay. Now we can end this.

1272
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,838
Just stop. Just stop.

1273
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,090
Just stop! Stop!

1274
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:27,133
Stop, stop, stop!

1275
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:38,269
Britt!

1276
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:44,525
Help!

1277
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,619
Get out of my pool.

1278
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,622
Get off my property!

1279
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,457
You're fired!

1280
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,292
- Never come back!
- Help!

1281
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,421
I can't swim!

1282
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:13,930
Britt! Britt!

1283
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:39,997
Lenore, it's me.

1284
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,083
It's me, Kato.

1285
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,127
What the hell?

1286
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:46,629
- That's for whatever lie you told Britt.
- What?

1287
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:49,006
He called me a minx,
and then he fired me.

1288
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,679
Chili was a fine warrior.

1289
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,266
He was a man of honour and dignity.

1290
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,727
We must show our respect.

1291
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,522
And we must show it in blood.

1292
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,275
Popeye, go forth.

1293
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,111
Take these words
and spread them:

1294
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:13,614
The bounty, 1 million dollars.

1295
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:16,534
The prey, the Green Hornet.

1296
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,703
Dead, if possible.

1297
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,122
Alive, if necessary.

1298
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,001
I don't care whence they have to go,
or who they have to do.

1299
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:28,754
I want the head of the Green Hornet,
and I want it tonight!

1300
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:32,383
Find him. Kill him. Take him out.

1301
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,058
How do you do?

1302
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,686
Everybody, chase The Hornet!

1303
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,522
It's about The Hornet.
We want him dead.

1304
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:47,690
All right.

1305
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:49,859
Hey, you, do me a favour.

1306
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,570
Listen to me. He's got a mask on.

1307
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:55,239
I need you to spread the word,
all right? Kill him.

1308
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:56,908
The mask was green. Yeah.

1309
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,159
Yo.

1310
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:01,913
A green mask.

1311
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,415
A hit on The Hornet.
A million bucks.

1312
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,583
Good, good.

1313
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,585
What's going on?
What's the word?

1314
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,422
Listen, this Green Hornet.
He's got a mask on.

1315
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,382
One million dollar.
The Green Hornet.

1316
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,760
You got it. All right.

1317
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,094
Hey, Jacko!

1318
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,388
Hey, man, you wanna
make a few bucks?

1319
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,542
You failed to kill me
The Hornet, Popeye!

1320
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:57,760
I warned you about this.

1321
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,679
You heightened this
thing to a point...

1322
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:02,265
...where it had to reach
some kind of a climax.

1323
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:04,642
Well, here it is.

1324
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,314
I hope you realise now that
you should stay out of my way.

1325
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:12,567
Let me run this paper.

1326
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,742
A gruesome scene last night as
bodies were found across the city...

1327
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,579
...every one of them
wearing green clothing.

1328
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,334
DA Scanlon's office, please.

1329
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:33,212
The victims were unrelated
and authorities believe...

1330
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,964
...their only connection was...

1331
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,426
...their choice of attire.
As a precaution, police are advising...

1332
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,846
...citizens to avoid wearing
the colour green, so as not to be...

1333
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,806
...unwittingly targeted.

1334
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,852
This is my fault. This is
what I did with this paper.

1335
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:48,853
So what?

1336
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:52,356
At least you tried. Your dad
would have understood that.

1337
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:54,859
Look, running a newspaper
must be difficult.

1338
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:58,571
I mean, if it's anything like running
a re-election campaign...

1339
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,615
...it's gotta be a pain in the ass.

1340
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:05,786
Fortunately, I think we can
make each other's lives easier.

1341
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:07,830
How?

1342
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,707
There are two sides
to every story.

1343
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:12,877
I mean, some people,
they see an event and they...

1344
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,963
...interpret it as this crime war,
you know?

1345
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,882
Other people see
the same incident...

1346
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,343
...and they interpret it
as an isolated event.

1347
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,845
- Yeah.
- I guess I could...

1348
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:27,892
...help you decide how
these incidents are exposed.

1349
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,810
In the public interest, of course.

1350
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:34,023
Now, if this collaboration
leads to assert my position...

1351
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:36,400
...well, I will make sure that you...

1352
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,904
...enjoy compensation in return.

1353
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,491
What kind of compensation?

1354
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:46,952
Frank, are you--?

1355
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:49,580
Are you saying you want me
to slant the news...

1356
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:51,999
...for your re-election?
Is that what this is?

1357
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,542
I thought you needed my help.

1358
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,295
We help each other out...

1359
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,923
...so that we can both get ahead.

1360
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,467
This is mutually beneficial.

1361
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,679
Okay, I get it now.

1362
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:07,348
You went to my dad,
he rejected your offer...

1363
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,558
...and you think you can
push me around.

1364
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,560
That's what you think?

1365
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:13,479
No, what I think...

1366
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:17,191
...is that you overvalue
your dad's integrity.

1367
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,987
You get out of my office
right this second.

1368
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,786
This might be
what you're looking for.

1369
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:29,995
Thank you.

1370
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:31,247
You're welcome.

1371
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,773
Stay here.

1372
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,945
Boss, what are you
doing up here?

1373
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:04,780
We were waiting for you down--

1374
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,157
Come here.

1375
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,827
I've been doing some thinking.

1376
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:12,455
And I had a revelation.

1377
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:14,415
Look, I'm obsolete.

1378
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,292
I'm a dinosaur.

1379
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,836
Not in the scary way,
in the extinct way.

1380
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,588
And it's time for changes.

1381
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,089
You know, it's time for me...

1382
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,382
...to gain some...

1383
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:25,843
...charisma.

1384
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,929
I've no idea what you're
talking about. I mean--

1385
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:33,350
I'm talking about a motif.
A theme.

1386
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:34,518
A mask.

1387
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:36,520
Perhaps a stylish cape.

1388
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:39,064
I'm talking about the death
of Chudnofsky...

1389
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:42,067
...and the rebirth of Bloodnofsky.

1390
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:44,487
What do you say?

1391
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:47,573
Honestly?

1392
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:48,824
Yeah.

1393
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:53,788
I think that is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

1394
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:56,332
Why is that stupid?

1395
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,167
That's not stupid.

1396
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:00,711
Bloodnofsky.

1397
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,215
I was gonna wear red.

1398
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:06,175
For blood, get it?

1399
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:08,135
That's scary.

1400
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:09,887
And cool.

1401
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,514
Get this:

1402
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:16,477
"Be it my mask or your blood, red will
be the last colour you'll ever see."

1403
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,731
I say that to people
when I kill them.

1404
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,900
The Green Hornet killed Chili.

1405
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:25,611
I am minus an eyeball here.

1406
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,656
You can't go and tell these
guys that, they'll think you've...

1407
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,157
...lost your bloody mind.

1408
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:32,743
I think you're having
a midlife crisis here.

1409
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,829
Seriously, you're starting
to scare me.

1410
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,374
Want to know a secret?

1411
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,585
I'm starting to scare myself.

1412
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,593
Gentlemen...

1413
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:53,180
...the reign of Bloodnofsky
starts tonight.

1414
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,897
- Hey. I'm sorry I fired you!
- Get out of here!

1415
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:04,108
I shouldn't have
called you a minx.

1416
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,776
Look, please, just listen to me.

1417
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,611
Kato lied about us, okay?

1418
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,072
You should have found that out
before you fire me.

1419
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,907
- Nothing happened?
- No.

1420
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,952
Oh, thank God! I knew it!
I knew nothing happened!

1421
01:21:15,161 --> 01:21:17,621
- That ass. He said you did this.
- What?

1422
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:18,455
What is that?

1423
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:21,292
I don't know. It's gross.
That's not why I'm here.

1424
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:23,127
I need you to come back and work.

1425
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,629
I'll do whatever you want.
I'll double your salary.

1426
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,549
Things at The Sentinel
Not what they seem.

1427
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,467
As soon as Scanlon
started running...

1428
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,554
...my father stopped printing news
about hard crime.

1429
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,306
He was making Scanlon
look good.

1430
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:37,683
And I have to make it right.

1431
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:42,146
And I realised that if I want to do
what's best for this world...

1432
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:45,649
...that The Daily Sentinel is the most
responsible way to do that.

1433
01:21:45,817 --> 01:21:47,276
But here's the problem:

1434
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:48,652
I don't know...

1435
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,070
...anything...

1436
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,197
- ...about journalism.
- That's the truth.

1437
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:54,658
Look, I need someone who does.

1438
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:57,828
I need someone who
I can trust with my life.

1439
01:21:57,996 --> 01:21:59,246
I'm just-- Okay?

1440
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:02,666
I need someone who is you.
I need you, Lenore.

1441
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,669
Will you please help me?

1442
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:09,924
Britt, I--

1443
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,343
I know, I know.

1444
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,428
Oh, my God!

1445
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:17,348
Oh, God.

1446
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,099
What is your problem?

1447
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,100
God.

1448
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,477
Why did you do that to me?

1449
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:22,978
Because you tried to kiss me!

1450
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:25,439
- Yeah, we were gonna make out.
- No, we weren't.

1451
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:28,692
Then I guess I owe you an apology,
because I misread that.

1452
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:29,860
As usual.

1453
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:33,447
Okay. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't plan
on kissing you when I said all that.

1454
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,616
Will you come back
and work for me, please?

1455
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:36,867
Pretty please?

1456
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,535
Double my salary.

1457
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:40,454
And I want a parking spot.

1458
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,873
You don't have a parking spot?
Oh, that sucks.

1459
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:46,210
And if you ever so much
as look at my ass again...

1460
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,378
I can't even see it.

1461
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,215
...I will sue you for sexual harassment.
Do you understand?

1462
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:52,883
Hugs?

1463
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:55,135
Where my hugs at, y'all?

1464
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,417
- Britt Reid's office.
- Frank Scanlon.

1465
01:23:27,293 --> 01:23:28,460
Please hold.

1466
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,421
DA Scanlon.

1467
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:32,006
- Really?
- Yes.

1468
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:33,799
Hello?

1469
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:35,926
Hey, Britt, it's Scanlon.

1470
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:39,096
Listen, I think I owe you
an apology.

1471
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:53,444
Too much blood in the gutter.
You win. Let's split L.A.

1472
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:56,947
You get the L. I get the A.
That means we share the gold...

1473
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,615
...and the work.

1474
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:06,540
One million dollars for today.

1475
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,460
I think you misunderstood
where I was coming from...

1476
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:11,962
...and I'd like a chance
to clarify some things.

1477
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,380
Things are pretty clear.

1478
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,132
- I got three words for you:
- No.

1479
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,092
- Suck it, you dick face!
- Look.

1480
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,803
Tell him that you wanna meet him.
This is journalism.

1481
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:23,015
If you wanna be an investigative
reporter, you have to investigate.

1482
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:24,808
Tell him that you wanna meet him.

1483
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:27,978
- Might've gotten disconnected, Britt.
- You're right. Watch this.

1484
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:33,984
I was joking.

1485
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:36,820
Yeah, why don't we get together
and talk about things?

1486
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:38,155
That's a good idea. Okay?

1487
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,075
Let's meet for dinner.
A place called Gonpachi Hibachi.

1488
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,659
Little place on La Cienega.

1489
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:44,203
Around 8:30?

1490
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,125
La Cienega...

1491
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:51,210
...8:30.

1492
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:31,834
Britt!

1493
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:43,887
Hey, Frank.

1494
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:44,930
Hey, Britt.

1495
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:46,098
Good to see you.

1496
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,058
I'm having a sake.
What are you having?

1497
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,560
Yeah, I'll have some sake.

1498
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,230
Thanks for coming.

1499
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:55,065
No problem.

1500
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:28,640
Mr. Chudnofsky?

1501
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:30,934
Bloodnofsky. Blood-nof-sky.

1502
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:34,313
I commissioned the Green Hornet.
You're the chauffeur.

1503
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:36,148
Partner.

1504
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,524
Where's The Hornet?

1505
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:39,484
Right there.

1506
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,780
Whoa, we only get half the team?

1507
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:45,324
Who says you're the good half?

1508
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:51,872
Where's Reid?

1509
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,207
Guess.

1510
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:59,296
Any of you move, you're dead.

1511
01:27:00,131 --> 01:27:02,299
I'm not actually here
for forgiveness, Britt.

1512
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,508
I don't understand.

1513
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:05,135
You understand nothing...

1514
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:07,471
...so I'm gonna explain it
to you very simply.

1515
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:10,974
If you ever come across any article
regarding a major crime...

1516
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:12,809
...a man named
Benjamin Chudnofsky...

1517
01:27:12,977 --> 01:27:15,270
...or anything that makes
this city think...

1518
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:18,565
...I am not the fine line protecting
the light from the darkness...

1519
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,192
...you're gonna bring it to me.

1520
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,777
You're gonna bring it to me...

1521
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,112
...and I'll tell you
if it's okay to print...

1522
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,323
...in your stupid little newspaper.

1523
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,576
That's how I did it with your dad.

1524
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:32,704
And that's how you and I
are gonna do it.

1525
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:38,460
Scanlon, are you saying you want me
to let you write the news?

1526
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:44,341
Finally you understand.

1527
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:49,179
Yup. I understand, all right.

1528
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:50,722
Here's what I understand.

1529
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:54,017
That you, son, just got played...

1530
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,228
...by a player.

1531
01:27:56,562 --> 01:27:58,522
Recording device. USB.

1532
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,232
No, you can't have it, it's mine!

1533
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,317
You stupid schmuck!

1534
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:05,737
I got you by the balls, Scanlon.
I own a newspaper, genius.

1535
01:28:05,905 --> 01:28:08,031
- This'll be front-page.
- I have to say...

1536
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:09,741
- ...I'm impressed.
- You should be.

1537
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:11,076
It won't do you any good.

1538
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,204
How could it not? Are you
gonna kill me in this restaurant?

1539
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:15,205
Yes.

1540
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,124
What, you're gonna murder me?

1541
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:20,002
Yeah. Like I murdered your father.

1542
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:23,755
I don't think so. My dad was not
murdered. He died of a bee sting.

1543
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:26,591
No, no, your father died of
an overdose of apitoxin...

1544
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:30,220
...most commonly found in a bee sting,
which he happened to be allergic to.

1545
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:32,014
But that apitoxin...

1546
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,891
...was administered by me.

1547
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,020
Shit!

1548
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:42,065
Think, Britt. You can figure this out,
my son, with your brains.

1549
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:44,818
It's almost like time slows down.

1550
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:48,488
That's right. Think. Slowly.

1551
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:51,408
Okay, two years ago,
Scanlon decides to run for DA.

1552
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,910
He says he's cleaning up
the streets of L.A...

1553
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,620
...which is impossible.

1554
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:57,622
So he asked the media
to slant the news.

1555
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,000
And you go along with it
like everybody else?

1556
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,918
No way. I refused.

1557
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:04,921
So he-- Shit! What does he do?
So Scanlon decides...

1558
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:06,089
...to go really dirty.

1559
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:09,092
Makes a pact with a criminal.
Chudnofsky kills your reporter.

1560
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:10,427
Vertolibe? Vertoleeb?

1561
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,513
I didn't want more bloodshed,
so I stopped reporting on crime.

1562
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,474
To be honest,
in the last few years...

1563
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:17,934
...this paper has dipped
in quality and ambition.

1564
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:20,145
Scanlon can hold up
his part of the deal...

1565
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:23,732
...keeping the media under control,
and Chudnofsky does what he wants!

1566
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:24,941
To be honest....

1567
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,944
But Chudnofsky
had a different plan.

1568
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:30,781
He wanted to take over
all the gangs of L.A.

1569
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:32,616
So that's when you decided...

1570
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:33,950
...to cut the strings.

1571
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:37,579
I couldn't look in the mirror.
I hated every word I said to you...

1572
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:38,789
...that morning, Britt.

1573
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,666
So you start reporting
on crime again.

1574
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:43,418
And now Scanlon
is a dead man...

1575
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:45,462
...unless he proves
he's still in control.

1576
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,255
He has no choice
but to organise...

1577
01:29:47,423 --> 01:29:48,799
...a meeting with you...

1578
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,134
...and he kills you himself.

1579
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:53,804
In the end...

1580
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,473
...you stood up
for what's right, Dad.

1581
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,392
Now I have to do the same.

1582
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:06,525
I can see by that expression you've
had on your face for five minutes...

1583
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:09,277
...that you're piecing this together,
but it's no good.

1584
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:11,530
You're about to be killed
by the Green Hornet.

1585
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:13,156
What?

1586
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,664
The Green Hornet's sidekick!
He's got a gun!

1587
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:24,751
Bluff! Bluff!

1588
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:26,503
Eradicate!

1589
01:30:29,882 --> 01:30:32,426
Before you do this,
I want you to know that I'm sorry.

1590
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,678
I'm sorry for everything.

1591
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:36,721
I forgive you.

1592
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,353
Hey, not me. Him, stupid.

1593
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:45,272
Confused? You should be.

1594
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:47,357
Go, go.

1595
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,650
Let's bail, Kato!

1596
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:50,360
Back here!

1597
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,871
We're cornered!

1598
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,373
Know what happens
when you corner a hornet?

1599
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:04,875
- No!
- You get stung!

1600
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,462
Oh, Je--!

1601
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:17,053
See? Backups.

1602
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:21,391
Go, go, go!

1603
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:28,648
What the hell?
He's supposed to kill Britt Reid!

1604
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:30,942
- He's shooting at me!
- Embark the vehicle!

1605
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:32,486
Okay, okay, okay.

1606
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:43,788
Are you okay?

1607
01:31:43,956 --> 01:31:45,457
Wait. Yeah, I'm fine.

1608
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:46,958
My outfit's back here.

1609
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,589
Britt Reid is the Green Hornet!

1610
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,716
I know.
You hired a guy to kill himself.

1611
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,093
Shut up!

1612
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:00,597
Britt Reid recorded
the whole conversation...

1613
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,098
...on some sushi drive USB!

1614
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:03,600
We can't lose him!

1615
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,685
We're not losing him,
we're following him!

1616
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:06,853
Oh, Kato. Thank you.

1617
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:09,314
- I need to hug you to thank you!
- What the hell?

1618
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:10,148
Okay.

1619
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:11,441
- To the house?
- No!

1620
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:12,692
Here's the dilly yo.

1621
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:16,196
We gotta get this to The Sentinel.
It's got Scanlon spilling the beans.

1622
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,114
We're gonna put it on the Net.

1623
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:20,075
It's what my father
would have wanted.

1624
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:22,077
- You like your father now?
- Yes!

1625
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:23,954
You see, he wasn't a dick after all.

1626
01:32:24,121 --> 01:32:27,791
Well, he was a dick, just not
really how we thought he was.

1627
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,628
At the end, he wasn't a di-- It's
complicated. I'll explain later, okay?

1628
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,630
It's a lot of conflicting emotions.

1629
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:35,465
Let's roll, Britt.

1630
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:45,809
Here's the thing, honestly.

1631
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,019
I've been jealous of you
this entire time.

1632
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:50,564
- You're awesome. You built this car.
- I know.

1633
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:52,899
- You know karate. You're charming.
- Thank you!

1634
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:54,901
These guys are amazingly
well organised.

1635
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:57,862
Hold on!

1636
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:01,992
Yeah! Yeah!

1637
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:04,202
Oh, yeah!

1638
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:11,084
Burn them from the side!

1639
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:12,919
Door guns!

1640
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:13,920
What's a door gun?

1641
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:14,671
Here!

1642
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:21,678
The other side!

1643
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:24,055
Your turn!

1644
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:30,854
Oh, God!

1645
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:39,696
Oh, shit!

1646
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:43,950
We lost him!

1647
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:46,119
- He's gone! He's gone!
- Yeah!

1648
01:33:47,121 --> 01:33:48,705
Shit! He's back!

1649
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,373
You gotta be kidding me.

1650
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:51,750
These guys are good!

1651
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,210
Over there, over there!

1652
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:56,713
We're not gonna make it, dude.

1653
01:33:57,882 --> 01:33:59,049
We're not gonna make it!

1654
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:00,550
Yeah, we're gonna make it!

1655
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:16,066
That's a very big gun.

1656
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:29,996
Kato, be careful!

1657
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:32,499
Take the wheel.

1658
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:33,416
What?!

1659
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:34,751
- Take the wheel.
- I can't!

1660
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:35,877
Yes, you can!

1661
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:37,879
Nunchucks?! That was my idea!

1662
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:39,923
Where are you going?

1663
01:34:46,972 --> 01:34:48,765
Are you okay?
What are you doing?

1664
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:03,697
Shit! Shit!

1665
01:35:03,906 --> 01:35:04,531
Kato!

1666
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:05,532
Jesus!

1667
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,158
I don't know what anything does!

1668
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:08,993
Why didn't you do this in English?!

1669
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,504
- What are you saying?
- Closer.

1670
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:20,672
Just jump in!

1671
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,840
Turn the knob!

1672
01:35:22,007 --> 01:35:23,466
These guys are shooting at me!

1673
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:26,886
- Sorry! I'm sorry!
- Turn the knob!

1674
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:28,388
- I don't know how!
- Calm down!

1675
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:31,641
How do I stop it?

1676
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,185
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1677
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:40,692
- It's on fire!
- It's okay.

1678
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:42,152
It's okay!

1679
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:43,820
Next time, don't touch anything.

1680
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,366
Kato! Look!

1681
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:49,659
We made it!

1682
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:51,411
- Kato, we made it!
- Hell, yeah!

1683
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:52,579
Yeah!

1684
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,372
- I can't.
- Okay, that's cool.

1685
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,465
Oh, we're screwed!

1686
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:26,696
Come on, hurry! Hurry up!

1687
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:35,830
Did you drop it?

1688
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:36,664
Yes.

1689
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:37,665
Shit!

1690
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,005
Go get it! I'll cover you!

1691
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,465
Wish me luck!

1692
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,301
Good luck!

1693
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,617
Dear Hornet...

1694
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:14,202
...be it my mask...

1695
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,037
...or your blood, red will be...

1696
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:16,913
...the last--

1697
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,750
It's Britt Reid!

1698
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:22,210
There he is! Get him!

1699
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,254
Don't let them go!

1700
01:37:24,421 --> 01:37:25,421
Come on!

1701
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:28,007
Get him! Get him!

1702
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:32,512
Let me shoot him!

1703
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:35,056
Oh, no.

1704
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:38,726
Shoot to kill!

1705
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:42,021
You brought a gas mask?!

1706
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:43,648
Of course I brought a gas mask!

1707
01:37:43,816 --> 01:37:44,774
Just for yourself?!

1708
01:37:49,154 --> 01:37:50,280
Where the--?

1709
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:12,302
There!

1710
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:18,474
There! Behind the paper!

1711
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:26,608
Over here!

1712
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:33,698
The helmet, it fogs up everything.

1713
01:38:42,791 --> 01:38:44,125
There. There.

1714
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:44,959
Shoot, shoot.

1715
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:51,507
Kato!

1716
01:38:54,136 --> 01:38:55,637
Kato, save me!

1717
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:05,438
I'm ungassable!

1718
01:39:13,238 --> 01:39:14,030
Move it!

1719
01:39:21,163 --> 01:39:22,372
That was dangerous.

1720
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:26,876
Drop me by the elevators,
I'll take it from here!

1721
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:33,758
No, we stay together!

1722
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:41,683
Get in the front seat!

1723
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:42,642
Quick! Quick!

1724
01:39:52,903 --> 01:39:54,696
Tenth floor! Tenth floor!

1725
01:39:54,863 --> 01:39:55,571
What works?

1726
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,240
- Missiles?
- Four missiles left.

1727
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:58,533
Hornet gun?

1728
01:39:58,701 --> 01:39:59,867
Check. Machine guns?

1729
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:00,702
Check.

1730
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:01,661
Does it drive?

1731
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,496
Front-wheel drive.

1732
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:09,669
Get out!

1733
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:10,837
Get out of here!

1734
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,261
You can let me out here.

1735
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:24,726
Bazooka!

1736
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:25,852
Guy with a bazooka!

1737
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:29,397
Missile!

1738
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:31,315
Fire!

1739
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:42,326
Reload!

1740
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:47,915
Kato, they're here.

1741
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:49,292
Go be a journalist.

1742
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,543
I'll kick ass.

1743
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:51,627
There they are!

1744
01:40:51,795 --> 01:40:52,420
There!

1745
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,055
Come on.

1746
01:41:09,104 --> 01:41:09,812
I'm there.

1747
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:12,231
In one minute,
this'll be all over the world.

1748
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:16,152
Blue team, go!

1749
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:18,988
Start up.

1750
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:23,493
Shit!

1751
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:28,998
Yeah.

1752
01:41:44,306 --> 01:41:44,972
There!

1753
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:09,705
Can you see him? I can't see him.

1754
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:38,818
Oh, I'm so stupid.

1755
01:42:49,246 --> 01:42:50,538
All right, Reid!

1756
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:52,540
Hand over the thing.

1757
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:53,541
You want it?!

1758
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:55,543
Go get it!

1759
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:02,049
Where is it? Where is it?

1760
01:43:02,217 --> 01:43:03,551
I am Bloodnofsky.

1761
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,429
I killed a thousand before
and I'll kill a thousand more.

1762
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:16,981
Now tremble before your death.

1763
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:20,026
For be it my mask,
or be it your blood...

1764
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:23,112
...red will be the last colour
you'll ever see.

1765
01:44:13,038 --> 01:44:13,913
Britt.

1766
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:14,997
Britt!

1767
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:27,802
- Shit!
- Hey!

1768
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:30,304
End of the road, Scanlon.

1769
01:44:30,472 --> 01:44:32,682
Okay, okay.
Let's just calm down.

1770
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:34,433
Hand over the sushi.

1771
01:44:35,477 --> 01:44:36,602
Yeah, hand it over.

1772
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:37,770
We can talk about it.

1773
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,605
- On the ground, now!
- Get down!

1774
01:44:39,856 --> 01:44:41,691
It's the Green Hornet. Shoot him!

1775
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:48,531
Britt, quick!

1776
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,909
I'm District Attorney Frank Scanlon!

1777
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:54,870
That is the Green Hornet.
Go shoot him!

1778
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:57,707
Down on the ground!

1779
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:01,502
Kato, I screwed up!

1780
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,379
Scanlon's gonna
get away scot-free!

1781
01:45:04,214 --> 01:45:04,839
No, he's not.

1782
01:45:33,618 --> 01:45:35,161
Don't move. Don't move.

1783
01:45:44,671 --> 01:45:46,339
Holy shit!

1784
01:45:46,506 --> 01:45:48,215
Ejector seats!

1785
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:49,759
You actually built them!

1786
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:50,926
It was a good idea.

1787
01:45:58,060 --> 01:46:00,269
This is really scary.

1788
01:46:01,271 --> 01:46:03,397
A high-speed chase
between the Green Hornet...

1789
01:46:03,565 --> 01:46:06,359
...and gang members has led
to The Daily Sentinel office...

1790
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:07,943
Oh, my God! I called it.

1791
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:11,030
...leaving a trail of demolished cars
and trucks in their path.

1792
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,909
Here's the story: We're on our way
to a costume party. Okay?

1793
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,203
We gotta get out of our suits.

1794
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:19,455
Where the hell are we gonna go?

1795
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:22,541
No one knows why
the district attorney....

1796
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:24,210
Lenore!

1797
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:25,169
No, no, no.

1798
01:46:26,963 --> 01:46:28,089
- Lenore, stop!
- No, wait!

1799
01:46:28,256 --> 01:46:29,715
Stop. Lenore!

1800
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:30,674
Lenore! Wait.

1801
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:31,967
How do you know my name?

1802
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:32,927
Kato.

1803
01:46:33,178 --> 01:46:34,387
- It's me.
- Oh, my God.

1804
01:46:35,263 --> 01:46:37,973
You assholes!

1805
01:46:38,141 --> 01:46:40,643
What the hell are you doing?!
You guys are criminals!

1806
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:42,478
You're criminals! Oh, my God.

1807
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:44,814
- Stop.
- We're helping people.

1808
01:46:44,981 --> 01:46:47,358
Why ask me to do research
on the Green Hornet...

1809
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:49,068
...when you are
the Green Hornet?

1810
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,321
We don't know what we're doing.
We needed you. Don't you see?

1811
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:53,823
- You're the mastermind.
- What?

1812
01:46:54,908 --> 01:46:56,325
This is the police. Open up.

1813
01:46:56,493 --> 01:46:59,078
Please don't screw us.
We were trying to be good people.

1814
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:00,246
Think about it.

1815
01:47:01,748 --> 01:47:03,666
Hello, officer, can I help you?

1816
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:06,043
We're looking for two masked men.
Seen anything?

1817
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:07,503
Yeah, of course.

1818
01:47:07,712 --> 01:47:08,504
Really?

1819
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,673
They're all over the news
all the time.

1820
01:47:11,299 --> 01:47:14,301
All right. Well, please report
anything suspicious.

1821
01:47:14,469 --> 01:47:15,469
Absolutely.

1822
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:19,432
You guys are such stupid assholes!

1823
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:22,309
- What are you thinking?!
- Please forgive us. Forgive me.

1824
01:47:22,769 --> 01:47:24,645
- Are you crazy?
- Kiss and make up later.

1825
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:25,938
I don't kiss him!

1826
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:27,314
I got a bullet in me!

1827
01:47:27,482 --> 01:47:30,526
You and I don't kiss! You guys
might kiss, but I don't kiss you!

1828
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:33,779
I've been shot in the shoulder.

1829
01:47:33,947 --> 01:47:35,489
Well, then go to the hospital!

1830
01:47:35,657 --> 01:47:38,367
No! Don't you see? The police
know the Green Hornet was...

1831
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:39,702
...shot in the shoulder.

1832
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,872
If I go to the hospital,
they'll know I'm the Green Hornet.

1833
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:44,373
Yeah, you've been shot.

1834
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:45,791
- Here's what I need.
- What?

1835
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:48,002
Get me a spatula to bite
and a knife.

1836
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:51,380
You gotta dig this bullet
out of my meat. Do it.

1837
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:52,882
I'm cold.

1838
01:47:54,843 --> 01:47:56,218
It's deep inside me.

1839
01:47:56,511 --> 01:47:58,345
- Oh, God.
- Spatula.

1840
01:47:59,055 --> 01:48:00,973
Okay, okay. Wait!

1841
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,308
- Sterilise it!
- What?

1842
01:48:02,517 --> 01:48:03,559
Sterilise it.

1843
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,144
I don't wanna get gangrene.

1844
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:06,395
Say it, say it.

1845
01:48:07,647 --> 01:48:08,731
Shon-di forever.

1846
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:11,400
- Here we go, this is hot. Let me see.
- Just wait.

1847
01:48:11,568 --> 01:48:13,360
I'm not ready. Stop, stop, stop.

1848
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:15,196
Wait, it hurts.

1849
01:48:15,363 --> 01:48:17,490
Okay, I can't do it.
Take me to the hospital.

1850
01:48:17,657 --> 01:48:18,741
Would you just shut up?

1851
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:20,493
Okay, look, if I'm...

1852
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:23,913
...the mastermind of this, just let me
have a second of silence...

1853
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,582
...so I can figure this out! Okay?

1854
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,375
Mere hours ago...

1855
01:48:28,543 --> 01:48:31,337
...the Green Hornet and a group
of his criminal underlings...

1856
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:34,590
...launched a horrendous attack
on this building...

1857
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:38,302
...that claimed the life of
District Attorney Frank Scanlon.

1858
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:39,887
It's unfortunate, but...

1859
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:42,097
...you know, that's what happens.

1860
01:48:42,891 --> 01:48:45,100
The Daily Sentinel will be rebuilt.

1861
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:47,269
And to start that off...

1862
01:48:47,437 --> 01:48:51,398
...I am naming Mike Axford
the new editor in chief.

1863
01:48:52,108 --> 01:48:54,527
Mike's great and he's
comfortable telling me off...

1864
01:48:54,694 --> 01:48:57,029
...so he's the perfect man
for the job.

1865
01:48:57,447 --> 01:49:00,950
We have to get this paper
back to the ideals...

1866
01:49:01,117 --> 01:49:03,702
...that my father started it on.

1867
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:08,290
I wanna make him proud,
and I hope to...

1868
01:49:08,458 --> 01:49:12,628
...make this city proud of
The Daily Sentinel like never before.

1869
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:19,468
The Green Hornet
sends his regards.

1870
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:25,140
He shot me!

1871
01:49:26,268 --> 01:49:27,560
Directly in the shoulder!

1872
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:30,646
The Green Hornet's sidekick
shot Britt Reid!

1873
01:49:31,147 --> 01:49:32,439
Get me to the hospital!

1874
01:49:32,607 --> 01:49:34,066
He's been shot in the shoulder!

1875
01:49:34,234 --> 01:49:36,569
We gotta get him
to a hospital right away!

1876
01:49:38,488 --> 01:49:39,655
It worked.

1877
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:18,944
Kato.

1878
01:50:19,195 --> 01:50:19,945
Hey!

1879
01:50:20,196 --> 01:50:22,364
We have a secret mission.
Everything...

1880
01:50:22,532 --> 01:50:24,950
...we've done up till now is
complete and utter crap!

1881
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:26,785
This is all that matters.

1882
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:28,871
This is it.

1883
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:30,706
Let's roll, Kato.

1884
01:50:38,548 --> 01:50:39,923
It's crooked.

1885
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:41,884
He's kind of--

1886
01:50:42,218 --> 01:50:43,886
He's kind of looking....

1887
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:45,346
Down?

1888
01:50:45,513 --> 01:50:46,722
It's fine.

1889
01:50:46,973 --> 01:50:48,390
Doesn't matter.

1890
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:50,225
We did it.

1891
01:50:51,144 --> 01:50:52,227
We did.

1892
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:54,730
The Green Hornet.

1893
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:56,732
His reliable partner...

1894
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,400
...The Blue Wombat.

1895
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,362
Oh, man.

1896
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:05,949
Okay, how about
The Red Hippopotamus?

1897
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:08,410
No? Not Red Hippopotamus?

1898
01:51:08,578 --> 01:51:10,037
Hippos are not red.

1899
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:12,373
I know. Hornets aren't green.
Who cares?

1900
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:15,042
The Orange Albatross.

1900
01:51:16,305 --> 01:52:16,379
