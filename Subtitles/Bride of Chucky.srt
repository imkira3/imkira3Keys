It ain't the size that counts, asshole.
It's what you do with it.

159
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:19,698
All right.

160
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,515
Hi.

161
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:46,892
Hi.

162
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:50,563
- How you been ?
- Okay.

163
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:53,774
- You ?
- Peachy.

164
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:56,902
Actually, to tell you the truth,
I've been kinda out of it.

165
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:59,947
I know. It took me
ten years to find you.

166
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,911
That is sick.

167
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:09,248
What are you doing
with this jerk anyway ?

168
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,376
Ten years is
a long time, Chucky.

169
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,421
Besides, I was never
actually with him.

170
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,423
You know me.

171
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:21,051
I'll kill anybody,
but I'll only sleep with someone I love.

172
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:25,556
- You look great, Tiff.
- Thanks.

173
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:27,641
I mean it.
I gotta be honest.

174
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:31,103
l always thought
you were gonna let yourself go.

175
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,944
Come here.

176
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:42,865
Yeah.

177
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:51,123
Huh ?

178
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,669
Stop it.

179
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:58,130
- Hmm.

180
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:00,674
All right,
you satisfied ?

181
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:02,718
- Can I wait in the car, please ?
- No.

[ Siren Chirps ]

183
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,140
All right,
Boogie Nights, you're up.

184
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:10,476
This is such
a load of shit.

185
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,728
You know we haven't
been drinking.

186
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,564
Well, then, you've got
nothing to worry about, do you ?

187
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:19,527
Evening, Chief.

188
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:23,697
Seems like
a false alarm here.

189
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:26,200
That's okay, Norton.
Better safe than sorry, right ?

190
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:28,494
- This is a new low.
- For you too.

191
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,412
- Get in the car.
- Bite me.

192
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:34,833
Jade, when you're 18,
you can go to hell for all I care.

193
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,211
But until then,
I'm stuck with you.

194
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:39,630
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let you embarrass me...

with some trailer trash lowlife.

196

- You fuck.
- But you won't.

197
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:48,013
Not Jade anyway.
Not anymore.

In the car.

199

You can't keep us
from seeing each other.

201
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:01,694
So if, for example, I was
to run a blood test on you tonight...

202
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:05,698
and the results made you look like
Christian Slater on New Year's Eve,

203
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,367
you think anybody
would question me ?

204
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,662
- He's bluffing.
- Try me.

205
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,919
l wish we really could
choose our own families.

your orchid dry now, you hear ?

Screw him.

210

lf I were you, I would take Jade,
get the hell outta Dodge...

211
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:37,104
and never look back.

212
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,611
Look, Chucky.

213
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:46,363
l made Swedish meatballs,
your favorite.

214
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:48,908
Honey, you shouldn't have.

215
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:54,788
Well, I wanted everything tonight
to be absolutely perfect.

216
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:58,250
Tiff, what the hell
is that ?

217
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:01,003
It's a playpen, silly,
for the nursery.

218
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:06,258
You know, Chucky,
I still have the ring.

219
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:09,178
- What ring ?
- The ring, the one you left for me.

220
00:21:09,261 --> 00:21:13,641
l found it on the mantel the night you
were killed. I've never taken it off.

221
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:17,102
Oh, that ? The one I got
from Vivian Van Pelt.

222
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:19,313
- Vivian who ?
- Vivian Van Pelt.

223
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:22,441
l dumped her
in the river, remember ?

224
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:25,361
That ring is worth
five or six grand, easy.

225
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:29,865
You mean.... you weren't
gonna ask me to marry you ?

226
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:34,787
What are you, fucking nuts ?

227
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:37,665
You thought--

228
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:46,924
You haven't changed.

229
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,301
You'll never change.

230
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:51,679
What the hell
was I thinking ?

231
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:57,059
Now, the first thing we gotta do is
get me outta this body once and for all.

232
00:21:57,142 --> 00:21:59,144
No.

233
00:22:00,646 --> 00:22:04,275
I think I prefer you
like this.

234
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:08,445
You're kinda cute.
You're just like a little baby.

235
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,782
- Is the little baby ticklish ? Is he ?
- Stop !

236
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:14,410
- Is he ? Is he ? Is he ?
- Stop ! Stop !

237
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:18,539
- Is he ? Is he ? Okay. Mommy's tired.

238

Okay, I get it.

240
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:30,175
You're still hung up
on the domestic thing.

241
00:22:30,217 --> 00:22:33,053
No problem.
We'll get hitched.

242
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:38,350
Sorry.
I'm not into short guys.

243
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:53,407
My mother always said
love was supposed to set you free.

244
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,202
But that's not true, Chucky.

245
00:22:56,285 --> 00:23:00,623
I've been a prisoner of my love for you
for a very long time.

246
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,419
Now it's payback time.

- Treat her right, Jesse.
- Excuse me ?

Treat her right.
Never take her for granted.

300

It's like my mother
always used to say,

00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:46,015
''A woman spends all day
slaving over a hot stove for a man,

the least he can do
is the dishes.''

00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:17,838
W-O-M-A-N.

Oh ! Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

312
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:32,061
lf you can't play nice,
l may just have to take your toys away.

313
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:35,814
