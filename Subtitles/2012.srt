1
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:42,665
Hey, hey, watch out, watch out.

2
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,099
Welcome my friend!

3
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,664
Great to see you! Glad you made it

4
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:54,375
This can't be Ajit.

5
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:56,888
He's a little man already. Unbelievable.

6
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,598
I hope you're hungry, Adrian.

7
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:00,819
I'm famished. How are you, Aparna?

8
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,487
I made that fish curry you love.

9
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,905
I can't wait.

10
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:07,294
She gets more beautiful every time I see her, why is that?

11
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,451
Strange, isn't it?

12
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:10,307
But her fish curry is still awful.

13
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:13,915
You were mysterious on the phone.

14
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,563
Why didn't you attend the conference?

15
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,148
I will show you, Adrian, sir.

16
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:19,285
Satnam. Stop sir-ing me.

17
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:27,992
How deep do we need to go?

18
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:29,879
11000 feet.

19
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,778
Searched all over India for this dig.

20
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:36,041
Used to be the deepest copper mine in the world.

21
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:42,465
Remember my brother Gurdeep?

22
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:43,476
He's a student now.

23
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,322
Namaste, Dr Helmsley, sir.

24
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,376
Adrian. It's just Adrian.

25
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,306
It's so hot, ice's so little

26
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,110
Just don't pour too much, okay?

27
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:56,458
How do you work in this heat?

28
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,117
You've come on a good day, my friend.

29
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,463
Ssometimes it can be 120 degrees.

30
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,549
I want you to meet Dr Lokesh?

31
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:07,010
Fellow of quantum physics at the university in Chennai

32
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,887
Namaste Dr Helmsley.

33
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:14,194
So, what are we looking at?

34
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:18,991
These neutrinos are acting normally. No mass, no electrical charge.

35
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:21,514
They pass through ordinary matter almost undisturbed.

36
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:22,317
Your message said that

37
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,903
The count doubled after the last solar eruptions.

38
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:26,665
That was last week.

39
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,991
But this happened two days ago.

40
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:37,676
The biggest solar eruptions in human history.

41
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,847
Causing the highest neutrino count we've ever recorded.

42
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,162
My God.

43
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,323
That's not what worries me, Adrian.

44
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:56,049
For the first time ever the neutrinos are causing a physical reaction.

45
00:03:58,551 --> 00:03:59,886
That's impossible.

46
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,715
That feels very good!

47
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,355
Please, follow me.

48
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:16,006
You won't believe this.

49
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,355
This water tank goes down another 6000 feet.

50
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:25,484
It looks like the neutrinos coming from the sun

51
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:28,341
Have mutated into a new kind of nuclear particle.

52
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:38,226
They're heating up the earth's core.

53
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,573
And suddenly act like microwaves.

54
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,763
Ladies and gentlemen.

55
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:57,256
As promised, no speech!

56
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,582
Just a "thank you".

57
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:03,658
Tonight, with your extraordinary generosity,

58
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:07,870
We have raised 1.7 million dollars.

59
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,179
It's okay.

60
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,242
I work for the White House.

61
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:18,287
I don't care who you are, sir, this is a black tie event.

62
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,684
Scotty!

63
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,585
Hey, Adrian, I thought you were in India. What's going on?

64
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:26,274
I need your jacket. What?

65
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,859
I gotta speak to Anheuser. I don't wanna give

66
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,621
Give me your damn jacket!Please.

67
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:30,779
Okay.

68
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,552
Here, here. Take it, please.

69
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,964
Easy! That's a 600 dollar jacket.

70
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:41,529
Mr Anheuser?

71
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,395
Mr Anheuser?

72
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:45,992
I need to talk to you.

73
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:50,642
Do I know you?

74
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:52,540
Sorry sir,My name is Dr Adrian Helmsley.

75
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,950
I'm a deputy geologist at the office of science and technology policy.

76
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:58,629
Excuse me, fellows.

77
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:01,664
You know that this is a fund-raiser,

78
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,551
Not a frat party, right?

79
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,740
It's extremely important, sir.

80
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,918
You know what, It always is.

81
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:08,525
Here is what I want you to do. Make an appointment or even better,

82
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,465
Have your boss bring it up at the Quarterly science briefing, okay?

83
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:12,654
There's a good plan.

84
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:16,084
I just traveled 20 straight hours to get here, sir.

85
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:19,473
I haven't slept in two days. You need to read this, sir.

86
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,006
You need to read it now!

87
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,546
Let me guess. National geology crisis?

88
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:32,205
Excuse me.

89
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:51,756
Who do you report to?

90
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,258
Lico Vasos Not anymore.

91
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,534
Al, bring the car around.

92
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,172
You may wish you took a shower.

93
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:02,798
Sir?

94
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:04,143
You're about to meet the president.

95
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:05,676
What's going on?

96
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:07,605
Get that to the office.

97
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:38,969
Good morning.

98
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,869
I would like to meet privately with my fellow heads of state.

99
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:48,416
Mr Macaraca wishes to have his interpreters present.

100
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,688
Mr President,

101
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,273
I can assure you,

102
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:55,434
Your English is more than sufficient for what I have to say.

103
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:17,591
Mr President,

104
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,003
Six months ago,

105
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:27,518
I was made aware of a situation so devastating

106
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,178
That at first I refused to believe it.

107
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:39,009
However, through the concerted efforts of our brightest scientists,

108
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,741
We have confirmed its validity.

109
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:52,668
The world as we know it will soon come to an end.

110
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,813
This dam project

111
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,555
Will create many new jobs.

112
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:11,134
The party and country will assist in your re-location.

113
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:14,701
Grandma, give me your hand.

114
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:16,056
But where are they taking us?

115
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,401
It'll be alright.

116
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:23,574
Brother!

117
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,859
Grandma, I will send you money.

118
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:34,189
Who can write?

119
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,014
Who can read?

120
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:39,204
Who can weld?

121
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,688
Has his highness had an opportunity to study the dossier?

122
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:23,957
You must understand I have a big family, Mr

123
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,365
Isaacs.

124
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:28,733
One billion dollars is a lot of money.

125
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:33,550
I'm afraid the amount is in Euros, your highness.

126
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:53,362
I put a lot of faith into your organization.

127
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:57,480
It's a perfect replica, Roland.

128
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:01,766
There are too many fanatics out there that could damage her.

129
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:06,688
Just think about the beautiful buddha statues they blew up in Afghanistan.

130
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:11,223
Our heritage organization has already made selections

131
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:14,310
From the British museum and hermitage.

132
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:23,068
I guess she'll be safe now, tucked away.

133
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:25,696
Hidden, in some bunker in Switzerland.

134
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,273
Perfectly safe, Roland.

135
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:37,771
Only infrared analysis can reveal the difference.

136
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:40,628
But it's still a fake.

137
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:58,552
This mass suicide was actually discovered by a documentary crew here

138
00:11:58,562 --> 00:12:00,825
In the ancient Mayan city of Takal.

139
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,764
Now the victims, and we've seen many,

140
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,350
are said to have adhered to the Mayan-quiche calender,

141
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:10,282
Which predicts the end of time to occur on the 21st december of this year,

142
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,712
Due to the suns destructive forces.

143
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:13,744
Thank you, Mark.

144
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:14,724
Strangely enough,

145
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,278
Scientific records do support the fact

146
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:21,043
That we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history.

147
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:31,606
Many people believe that the Mayan calender predicts

148
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:34,056
That there's supposed to be a galactic alignment

149
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:37,716
I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man.

150
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:51,157
Hey, Kate, I'm practically on the freeway right now.

151
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:54,493
Yes, I'm rolling towards you as we speak.

152
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,591
Would you relax? I'll be there any second.

153
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,970
You know it's a vacation and not a doctors appointment, right?

154
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,733
It's supposed to be fun.

155
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,505
You remember fun, don't you Kate?

156
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,571
Do you remember where you were when it stopped being fun for you?

157
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:13,189
Got it.

158
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,456
Bug spray?

159
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:22,521
Oh yeah, cause it's mosquito season in Yellowstone.

160
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:26,421
I got a whole bunch. I gotta go, I'm in a bad reception area.

161
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:38,329
Woah, man. Would you look at that? Sick.

162
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:46,191
Merrill, I told you.

163
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:48,693
We have to move back to Wisconsin.

164
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,875
These little mini-quakes are really getting on my nerves, Randy.

165
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:53,980
Come on, a little surface crack,

166
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,659
You're not gonna be inconvenienced by that.

167
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,057
Right, surface crack. I've got a plastic surgeon for that.

168
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:01,289
No kidding. Thank God for those shake-proof coffee mugs.

169
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:03,573
They show the true nature of us Californians.

170
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:06,701
We'll not bow to these little inconvenient things like surface quakes.

171
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:07,504
Repent! The end is near.&

172
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:09,537
If you have a funny mini-quake story and want to share it.

173
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:11,987
Call Lisa & Randy at 555

174
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,997
Hi Daddy! Hi baby.

175
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,062
How are you sweety? Good.

176
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,200
Jackson. What is this?

177
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:27,524
Please don't call me that.

178
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,473
I'm your Dad.

179
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:30,902
Come on

180
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,748
Taking them camping in a limo?

181
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:36,668
Okay, great. What happened to your temp job?

182
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,432
Better hours, more time to write.

183
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,476
What about sleeping, have you been doing that lately?

184
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:44,562
I've said it a thousand times.

185
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:47,127
No lipo on Fridays. It's too messy.

186
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,222
Hold on.

187
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,692
Morning Jackson. Hi.

188
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:51,287
Nice ride. Thanks.

189
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:54,332
Have a nice trip. Remember, watch out for the bears.

190
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,543
Bye, Gordon Love you, honey.

191
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,953
-Bye. Okay, so You tell him.

192
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:03,038
Tell me what?

193
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:05,656
She needs to put these on every night before she goes to sleep.

194
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:06,678
Still?

195
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:09,368
Yes. Your 7 year old daughter still wets her bed.

196
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:10,838
Maybe that's something you should know.

197
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,028
Love you Love you, Mom.

198
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:15,478
You okay?

199
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:21,672
They really were looking forward to spending some time with you. I know.

200
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:23,653
So don't be on your computer all the time.

201
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:24,539
Got it.

202
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,076
Love you!

203
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:37,615
So this time we'll hit Japan. So?

204
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,658
Now you can visit your boy, Will.

205
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:41,556
Afternoon, ladies!

206
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,037
Hello

207
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,413
Are you even listening to me?

208
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:46,446
Unfortunately I am, Harry.

209
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,469
I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa now.

210
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,128
Would you mind keeping your nose out of my family?

211
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:53,850
You're cramping my style, baby. There we are.

212
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,447
So he married a Japanese girl, how's that the end of the world?

213
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,783
Come on Tony, you should at least go see him.

214
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,159
You see your boy?

215
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,152
Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long way,

216
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,904
But at least we talk. About what?

217
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:10,158
Life. And how short it is.

218
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,892
What the hell was that?

219
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,244
Hello? Laura?

220
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,934
Laura, can you hear me?

221
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:48,623
Roland, is that you?

222
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,959
Laura, they lied to us.

223
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,430
I've arranged a press conference for tomorrow.

224
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:55,943
I will tell everyone the truth about what is going on.

225
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:57,518
What are you talking about?

226
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:01,949
The art you collected is not in the Alps.

227
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:03,200
Those tunnels are empty.

228
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:05,025
I have proof!

229
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,217
Laura, can you hear me?

230
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:11,479
I'm losing you, Roland.

231
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,461
Laura, can you hear me?

232
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,826
I liked that song. We lost it.

233
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:48,902
The west coast with all those surface cracks,

234
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:51,175
I told myself, Charlie,

235
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:54,116
Get your stupid ass to Yellowstone.

236
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:57,786
I don't want to miss all the fun when it finally blows.

237
00:17:57,797 --> 00:17:58,599
Let me tell you,

238
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,030
There's been government people flying in and out all morning.

239
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,502
And trust me, they do not look happy.

240
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:08,099
Always remember, folks It's weird.

241
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:09,673
Can you believe he said that?

242
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:13,156
What are the odds?

243
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:16,670
We're not seeing the soil liquefaction we'd expect to fine.

244
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,662
Or any evidence of fracture propagation within the tectonic plates.

245
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:20,528
English, doctor.

246
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:24,031
The seismic activity on the west coast is not caused by tect

247
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:24,928
Regular earth quakes.

248
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,369
And these surface cracks have nothing to do with shifting fault lines.

249
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,632
Are you suggesting this could be the beginning of the Joline operation?

250
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,250
Dr Helmsley is flying to Yellowstone this morning

251
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,355
To collect more data, sir.

252
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,545
We've been following the schedule

253
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,557
You established, Mr Helmsley.

254
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,976
The most important schedule in the history of mankind.

255
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,510
Now you're telling me we have to throw it out?

256
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:46,168
Yes, sir.

257
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:49,338
I was wrong.

258
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:56,251
Do you know how many times I've heard those words in this office?

259
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,347
Zero.

260
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,132
Did you see this?

261
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:04,634
I'm sorry Mr President. She insisted.

262
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,917
It's all over the news.

263
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:12,486
We are learning more about this deadly car explosion,

264
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:15,301
The director of the French National Museum was

265
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:18,596
Scheduled to hold a press conference at the Louvre this morning.

266
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,618
Coincidentally,

267
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:22,527
His death took place in the same Paris Tunnel

268
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,624
where Princess Diana died in 1997.

269
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:28,523
We are continuing to follow this story

270
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,256
Laura, I don't believe you've met Dr Helmsley.

271
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:36,249
I just talked to him Dad, and he told me

272
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:38,324
The organization I work for is a sham.

273
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:39,690
Why would he say that?

274
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,031
You look just like your mother when you get upset.

275
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:50,347
Did I ever tell you that? Every time I get upset.

276
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:52,964
Daddy, a man was killed.

277
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:58,000
Honey. Please sit down.

278
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:11,024
Only a dozen people in this administration

279
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,494
know what I'm about to tell you.

280
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,444
Dad, what's going on?

281
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:23,484
An unprecedented international endeavor is under way.

282
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:27,790
At this point 46 nations are invested in this thing.

283
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,711
Laura's a smart girl. She'll understand that thing in Paris..

284
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,516
We're not involved in any of that, are we?

285
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,705
"We"? Who the hell is "we"?

286
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:38,082
What are you talking about?

287
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:40,876
What we need to do is focus on this time line.

288
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:42,440
So when do we let the country know?

289
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,880
What do you mean? The people, sir.

290
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:46,580
They need to know.

291
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:50,636
Well of course they do. Listen.

292
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,421
Your job is to figure out when this is all gonna fall apart.

293
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,621
My job is to figure out how to retain

294
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,906
Some type of government after it falls apart.

295
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:03,920
Until then we don't have time for anything except those jobs. Okay?

296
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,631
Call me when you have any news from Yellowstone.

297
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:07,622
Yes, Sir.

298
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:11,292
Cute girl, huh? Sir?

299
00:21:11,657 --> 00:21:13,471
The first daughter, I saw you looking at her.

300
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:18,059
I wasn't looking at her Better move fast kid the end is near.

301
00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:20,822
Your chopper's ready.

302
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,783
They're waiting on the south lawn.

303
00:21:25,171 --> 00:21:27,392
Daddy, where are we going?

304
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:30,019
This special place I know,

305
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,450
actually It's a place where your Mom and I used to hang out a lot.

306
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,785
I don't want to know where you and Mom had sex.

307
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,329
I'm not ready for that, Jackson.

308
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:40,259
Stop calling me that, it's creeping me out.

309
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:43,272
What's wrong with "Dad"?

310
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:44,440
Daddy, look at this.

311
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:46,671
That wasn't here before.

312
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:48,882
What did I do?

313
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,019
Go get your hat.

314
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:57,964
Can't you see the signs?

315
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:07,682
There used to be a lake here.

316
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:10,351
Doesn't look much of a lake to me.

317
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:12,489
I know. The whole damn thing's gone.

318
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:16,003
Come on, let's check it out.

319
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:17,254
Great.

320
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:42,519
Subjects have now entered hot zone.

321
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,887
What is that?

322
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,141
It's the U.S. Army.

323
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:14,050
All manner of government vehicle are converging on subjects.

324
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:16,167
You're in a restricted area, sir.

325
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,460
We need you and your family to come with us.

326
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,421
Right. Okay, we're gonna go with these guys.

327
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,632
That'll be fun, huh?

328
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,462
This is wild. This is really wild.

329
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:45,060
This is unbelievable. 2700'C at 40.000 feet?

330
00:23:45,071 --> 00:23:47,229
I know, it sounds completely implausible.

331
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,848
Nonetheless, we're noticing an increase of almost 0.5%

332
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:52,161
Per day? No.

333
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:53,840
Per hour.

334
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:56,937
Dr helmsley, we arrested some tourists in the hot zone.

335
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,564
I'll take care of it.

336
00:23:58,574 --> 00:24:01,421
Let's get Satnam on the communications link.

337
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:03,569
Try to cross reference the data.

338
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,592
It's a national park, there's not supposed to be fences.

339
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:08,636
What's going on here?

340
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,127
We're geologists.

341
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:13,349
You usually go digging with machine guns?

342
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:17,145
Major, I'll take care of this, thank you.

343
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:18,771
So what happened to the lake?

344
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:20,471
Well that's what we're trying to find out.

345
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,504
We think the entire area has become unstable.

346
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:24,621
I think you should take your kids and leave, Mr

347
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,227
Curtis.

348
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,586
You're not by any chance the Jackson Curtis who wrote "Farewell Atlantis"?

349
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:35,788
The very same.

350
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:39,271
It's actually dedicated to my Mom.

351
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:45,684
I read a couple of your short stories in college.

352
00:24:45,955 --> 00:24:49,719
Your father is a very talented man Listen up.

353
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,252
It's amazing. I'm reading your book.

354
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:54,703
I'm around day 300, the shuttle has just lost communication with earth.

355
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:56,496
You're one of the lucky few who bought it.

356
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:58,467
I didn't buy it. No?

357
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:00,657
My Dad gave it to me.

358
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:03,493
Let me ask you something.

359
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:06,298
Do you think those people would behave so

360
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:08,946
Selflessly knowing that their own lives were at stake?

361
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:10,344
I hope so.

362
00:25:11,157 --> 00:25:14,473
The critics said I was naive, an unabashed optimist,

363
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:15,818
But what do they know, right?

364
00:25:16,412 --> 00:25:19,947
It was a great pleasure meeting you.

365
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,305
Mayor, could you escort these good people to the camp grounds, please.

366
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:24,368
This is yours.

367
00:25:25,254 --> 00:25:26,203
Thank you Yes, sir.

368
00:25:26,214 --> 00:25:29,112
Take care. Okay he was very nice.

369
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:31,000
You're just saying that cause you like my book.

370
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,155
Looks like that boy of yours is gonna be smarter than any of us.

371
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:46,150
What's wrong?

372
00:25:46,557 --> 00:25:48,882
I sent Satnam the temperature readings.

373
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:53,439
My colleagues in Argentina and Ontario have almost identical data.

374
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:55,973
It's so hot here we've had to seal off the mine.

375
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:57,078
Did you double check the numbers?

376
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,861
I triple checked, my friend.

377
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:02,260
I wish we were wrong, but we're not.

378
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,087
The earth's crust is destabilizing.

379
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,239
It's too early.

380
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:15,659
Adrian. You have to begin the evacuation.

381
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:18,923
My God.

382
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:22,072
All our scientific advances,

383
00:26:22,468 --> 00:26:25,711
our fancy machines The Mayans saw this coming thousands of years ago.

384
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:37,399
I thought we'd have more time.

385
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:47,003
Okay.

386
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:49,735
Okay, I want you to pack up your family.

387
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,893
I'm gonna arrange an airlift from Delhi.

388
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:53,676
Thank you my friend.

389
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,709
And good luck.

390
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:05,959
Ajit.

391
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:09,421
We are going on a big ship.

392
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,007
Wait. Wait, wait.

393
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,207
Sorry. One question.

394
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,014
What did the government guys say to you?

395
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:34,676
They don't like us going over their fences

396
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:39,253
And that the whole area back there is unstable.

397
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:41,974
"Unstable"?They said "unstable"?

398
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:46,635
That's funny.

399
00:27:47,386 --> 00:27:48,043
Let's go.

400
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:49,837
"Unstable".

401
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:53,882
"Unstable".

402
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:01,348
It's not just Yellowstone, sir.

403
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:03,725
Temperatures are rising with incredible velocity

404
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:05,686
in hot zones across the globe.

405
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,324
Are you absolutely sure about this, Adrian?

406
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:12,515
Because once we give these orders, there's no going back.

407
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:15,133
I'm afraid there's no longer any doubt. Sir.

408
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:17,541
We have to save what we can.

409
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:19,512
And we have to move now!

410
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:53,192
There's mosquitoes in here. Did anybody spray the tent?

411
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,590
I'm gonna get that spray tomorrow.

412
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,176
They just like you because your blood's so sweet.

413
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:02,618
Dad, you said you wouldn't work on your book.

414
00:29:02,628 --> 00:29:03,514
What?

415
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:05,996
I'm not, I'm doing something else.

416
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:10,542
Okay.

417
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:16,048
Did you really need all these hats?

418
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:17,466
Where are your pull-ups? Sweetie.

419
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:18,686
I have them on.

420
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,580
Who gave you this? Mommy?

421
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:29,999
No, Gordon gave it to me for my birthday.

422
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:34,431
A cell phone is something we got to talk about as a family.

423
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,183
What family?

424
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:43,429
It hurts my feelings when you say stuff like that.

425
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,558
Go away.

426
00:29:52,803 --> 00:29:53,408
Adults get hurt feelings too.

427
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,107
No way.

428
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,640
tell the truth.

429
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,840
Thank you, Bill. What is your question?

430
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,092
I wanted to know, where is all this gonna start?

431
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:24,001
Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood.

432
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:27,651
They have the earth cracking under their asses already.

433
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:30,455
Our family believes in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus.

434
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:31,915
We have nothing to fear, Charlie.

435
00:30:31,926 --> 00:30:34,386
Good for you, Bill. Thanks for calling.

436
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:39,256
This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park,

437
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:44,480
Soon to become the worlds largest active volcano.

438
00:30:44,897 --> 00:30:46,722
I'll be right back, folks.

439
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:50,621
Do you mind if I join you?

440
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:53,030
I wanted to ask you something.

441
00:30:53,176 --> 00:30:54,667
I only got a minute.

442
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:56,096
Hi, Pickle?

443
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,714
I was listening to the broadcast

444
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:03,572
and I was wondering what exactly is it that's gonna start in Hollywood?

445
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:08,358
It's the apocalypse. End of days.

446
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:12,007
The judgment day. The end of the world, my friend.

447
00:31:12,018 --> 00:31:15,594
Christians call it the rapture, but the Mayans knew about it,

448
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:21,340
the hopis,The I Ching, the Bible.

449
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:24,478
Beer? Yeah.

450
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:26,355
So look, I gotta eat.

451
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:29,296
Why don't you download my blog?

452
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:33,936
It's free. Of course, we do appreciate donations.

453
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:35,072
In ancient times,

454
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,086
The Mayan people were the first civilization to discover that

455
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,744
This planet had an expiration date.

456
00:31:40,755 --> 00:31:45,979
According to their calender, in the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold,

457
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,888
Caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system

458
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:53,424
That only happens every 640.000 years.

459
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:55,071
Oh, not again.

460
00:31:55,488 --> 00:31:59,492
Neat, huh? I did all the animation myself.

461
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:01,974
Just imagine the earth as an orange

462
00:32:03,111 --> 00:32:05,436
You lure them in with humor.

463
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:07,678
Then you make them think.

464
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:11,317
Our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation

465
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:13,694
Screw you bastards, they are call nutrino.

466
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:17,354
That the core of the earth will melt at the inside part of the orange.

467
00:32:17,364 --> 00:32:20,670
Leaving the crust of our planet free to shift.

468
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,925
In 1958 Professor Charles "earth crust displacement"

469
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:28,709
Albert Einstein did support it.

470
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:30,200
People will get it all

471
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:33,453
The forces of mother nature will be so devastating it

472
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:36,801
Will bring an end to this world on winter solstice

473
00:32:36,811 --> 00:32:39,407
12-21-12.

474
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:40,940
Always remember, folks.

475
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:43,516
You heard it first from Charlie Frost.

476
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:47,426
You'd have to keep a thing like this under wraps.

477
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,219
Just think about it.Okay?

478
00:32:49,355 --> 00:32:52,014
First, the stock market would go.

479
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,641
Then the economy boom!

480
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:55,872
The dollar boom!

481
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:57,957
And then pandemonium in the street.

482
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:01,742
War, genocide. Boom boom boom!

483
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:05,194
Bullshit. Nobody could keep that big a secret, Charlie.

484
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:07,644
Somebody would blow the whistle an every once in a while

485
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:10,167
Some poor sucker tries.

486
00:33:10,178 --> 00:33:12,920
Like these guys. Boom! Boom!

487
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:16,288
Every one of these dead! Dead! Dead!

488
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,044
Woah, that's Professor Meyers.

489
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,588
He ran the Atlantis shuttle program.

490
00:33:24,598 --> 00:33:25,287
Did you know him?

491
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,226
Yeah, he helped me out with research on my book.

492
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:30,187
Well, that must have been before his accident.

493
00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:34,296
Meyers is dead? Yeah, two months ago.

494
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:37,591
He was one of my most avid listeners.

495
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,520
He had it all figured out.

496
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,554
Everything the government was doing, where, why.

497
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:45,744
He even sent me a map.

498
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:48,487
A map for what, Charlie? What's the map for?

499
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:59,529
They're building space ships, man.

500
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:11,437
Shit, man, I have to go. I gotta get back to earth.

501
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:13,345
But do you have a beer? ***

502
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,523
This is my last.

503
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:17,578
Alright, I really enjoyed most of this.

504
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,069
Thank you so much.

505
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,636
Guess what, they're selling seats!

506
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:23,491
Put me down for three.

507
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:26,097
No! Guys like you and me don't have any chance.

508
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:30,904
You'd have to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch or some Russian billionaire.

509
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:33,084
Keep it down, my kids are sleeping.

510
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:38,120
Get them out of yellowstone. It's gonna get ugly here.

511
00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:43,542
Why don't we make a baby?

512
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:48,411
We're not making a baby at the supermarket.

513
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:52,217
Hands off the merchandise.

514
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:56,690
Honey, woman give me thousands of dollars

515
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:57,754
To handle their boobs.

516
00:34:57,942 --> 00:34:59,068
You get it for free.

517
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:20,339
You always act strange after he shows up.

518
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,873
I'm not acting strange, I'm looking for macaroni.

519
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:28,743
So why did you stick with him so long anyways?

520
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,255
Can we just give it a rest, please?

521
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:31,924
He's the father of my children.

522
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:33,790
Oh, come on, Kate.

523
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,220
You gave up med school so you could have Noah.

524
00:35:36,324 --> 00:35:38,482
You practically raised him and Lilly by yourself

525
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:40,724
While he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk.

526
00:35:40,734 --> 00:35:42,872
It's not junk! He's published.

527
00:35:42,882 --> 00:35:44,738
Oh, published. Right, I forgot.

528
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,834
422 copies.

529
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:03,184
Did you see that?

530
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,446
See what?

531
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:08,085
Kate, listen, we have to keep working at this.

532
00:36:08,272 --> 00:36:09,378
Our relationship.

533
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,046
I meanI don't know, honey.

534
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:14,623
I just feel like there's something pulling us apart.

535
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:23,413
Grab the pole! Kate, don't let go!

536
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,127
Do you have anything for mosquito bites?

537
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:30,837
Before or after?

538
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:34,528
I'll get before and after.

539
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,832
Stop scratching or you're gonna get it all infected.

540
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:38,980
and I had to make a quick stop at the grocery store

541
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,733
Look, it's Mrs.Birnbaum, she's my teacher.

542
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:43,068
She's on TV!

543
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:45,455
Right here I'm in the Market

544
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:47,364
which was open for business at the time

545
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,408
But fortunately there are no fatalities or injuries reported.

546
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:52,932
It really is a miracle that no one got hurt.

547
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,830
Hello? Hi Mom.

548
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,760
Did you see what happened to our supermarket?

549
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,088
She wants us to come home.

550
00:37:04,276 --> 00:37:05,194
Is this even possible?

551
00:37:05,204 --> 00:37:07,425
We worked every option through the night.

552
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:09,365
The good news consensus is that

553
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,554
4 of the arks will be operational in time.

554
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:13,817
Only 4? You call that good news?

555
00:37:13,828 --> 00:37:16,268
We can save over 400,000 people.

556
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,415
To me, sir, that's nothing short of a miracle.

557
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:20,762
But we have to initiate the boarding process now.

558
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:24,171
Thomas. We don't have a choice.

559
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,695
You have got to convince them.

560
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,045
According to the latest information

561
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,903
Please continue, Adrian. Thank you, sir.

562
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,843
The temperature of the subterranean crust,

563
00:37:39,854 --> 00:37:43,858
That is the cement that holds our landmass in place,

564
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,413
Is increasing at a rapid rate much faster than anticipated.

565
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:50,802
As a result we've observed extreme polar instability,

566
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:55,275
The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80% in the last 48 hours.

567
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:58,059
How much time do we have, Dr. Helmsley?

568
00:38:00,937 --> 00:38:03,096
Two, maybe three days, if we're lucky.

569
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:06,641
How can you speak about luck in such a situation?

570
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:09,404
Apologies, Mr. Prime Minister.

571
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,772
I meant no disrespect.

572
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,507
I'm afraid the longer we wait, the more luck plays its part.

573
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:25,253
My friends.

574
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:29,361
I recommend we evacuate immediately.

575
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:36,525
If any of you have objections, please speak now.

576
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:43,365
In the blue corner, 38 victories, 34 knockouts,

577
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:46,493
The fighting machine from the Ukraine

578
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:50,862
The undefeated number one ranked heavy weight challenger

579
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:57,973
Mr. Zultan Balashin!

580
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,575
Yuri! Zultan!

581
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:07,545
I feared you would not come.

582
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:09,996
He needs to concentrate now. Mr. Karpov.

583
00:39:10,006 --> 00:39:13,697
You shut up while I talk to my boy, understand?

584
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:15,512
Yes, Mr. Karpov.

585
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,171
Good. That is good.

586
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,569
Zultan, listen to me.

587
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:24,594
We are fighters, we never go down.

588
00:39:24,604 --> 00:39:28,014
No matter how hard they hit us.

589
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:34,312
Kill the bastard.

590
00:39:35,052 --> 00:39:35,918
Ladies and gentlemen,

591
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:42,591
Let's get ready to rumble!

592
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,041
Yuri, where are you going?

593
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:19,357
Yuri!

594
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:31,828
Caltech believes that the fissures running through Westwood

595
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:34,247
Has released most of the surface tension.

596
00:40:34,455 --> 00:40:37,875
Life in the city will soon return to normal, Mayor Gonzales said

597
00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:41,076
Okay guys. Almost home.

598
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,059
Rise and shine.

599
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:55,727
Alright, you're free.

600
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:00,335
Mommy!

601
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,286
Hi, sweetheart.

602
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:08,708
Gordon!

603
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:11,889
Hey, buddy boy.

604
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:15,027
Had a good time? yeah?

605
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,133
God, I missed you.

606
00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:20,658
Who wants pancakes? Come on. Me!

607
00:41:25,757 --> 00:41:27,279
Thanks for bringing them home early.

608
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:28,426
Yeah.

609
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:30,855
Pancakes?

610
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:34,046
Late for work.

611
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,321
Yes, hello? Curtis, where are you?

612
00:41:48,613 --> 00:41:51,960
Just back from vacation, sir. Good. That is good.

613
00:41:52,075 --> 00:41:54,932
I will send a jet to pick up Alec and Oleg.

614
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:57,935
Yuri bear. Tell him to bring the rain coat for Caesar.

615
00:41:57,945 --> 00:41:59,207
It's in the Range Rover.

616
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:02,794
Curtis? Yeah. Get my boys as fast as you can.

617
00:42:02,804 --> 00:42:04,743
I'm hurling towards you as we speak, sir.

618
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:06,433
Good. That is good.

619
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,315
Curtis, you're late. Good morning to you too.

620
00:42:29,654 --> 00:42:31,103
Be careful with our stuff.

621
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:33,574
Don't get your dirt on it. Idiot.

622
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:43,136
Took you a while, Mr. Curtis.

623
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:49,820
What's your problem? Be more careful.

624
00:42:50,185 --> 00:42:51,686
He did that on purpose.

625
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:54,074
Have a safe trip, you little bastards.

626
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:56,483
Now you're laughing, Curtis.

627
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,714
But we have tickets to go on a big ship.

628
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:02,145
We will live, and you will die.

629
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:18,088
Did you hear that? The authorities in L.A.

630
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:20,611
Say there's nothing to worry about.

631
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:23,061
I'd love to see their dark faces

632
00:43:23,072 --> 00:43:29,787
When Malibu and Beverly Hills sink down into the Pacific.

633
00:43:29,797 --> 00:43:32,905
Where will they plug in their electric cars then?

634
00:43:37,597 --> 00:43:39,922
Is this your plane? Yeah Are you a pilot?

635
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:41,590
Yeah. I want to rent it, okay?

636
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:42,591
I'll give anything you want.

637
00:43:42,602 --> 00:43:44,145
Here, take this very expensive watch.

638
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,481
My neighbor gave it to me when he thought I was gonna be somebody.

639
00:43:50,443 --> 00:43:52,143
Caltech,

640
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:55,615
That in the last 36 hours we have basically zero

641
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:59,515
Earthquake activity in southern California, which is very rare.

642
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:02,945
Unlike the tough characters I have portrayed in my films

643
00:44:02,955 --> 00:44:03,790
Hello?

644
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:06,292
Kate. Stop what you're doing. Jackson?

645
00:44:06,303 --> 00:44:07,251
Listen to me.

646
00:44:07,262 --> 00:44:09,410
I've rented a plane, pack up the kids,

647
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,859
I'm gonna be there in 5 minutes.

648
00:44:11,308 --> 00:44:12,069
What are you talking about?

649
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,539
We're gonna have a regular Saturday.

650
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:15,583
Noah has music at 2:00 and Lilly has karate.

651
00:44:15,593 --> 00:44:17,042
You expect him to remember?

652
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:19,691
Kate, California is going down.

653
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:22,506
Pack up the kids now! They just got back.

654
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,352
God, you sound like a crazy person.

655
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:26,354
The governor just said we're fine now.

656
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:29,023
The guy's an actor, he's reading a script!

657
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:32,912
When they tell you not to panic that's when you run!

658
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,436
Will you call me back when you calm down?

659
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:39,127
Mommy, why are you acting so crazy?

660
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:43,579
Finish your pancakes, Al Capone.

661
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:48,480
It seems to me that the worst is over.

662
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:06,206
Hold Mommy's hands!

663
00:45:10,606 --> 00:45:13,860
Let's go! Let's go! I think it's safer under here!

664
00:45:13,954 --> 00:45:16,508
Get in the fucking car!

665
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:17,280
Righ now!

666
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,438
Let's go! Let's go! Let's let's go!

667
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:20,742
Come on, kids!

668
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:22,003
Move, quick, qiuck!

669
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:31,909
Get in. Get in.

670
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,848
My hats!

671
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:40,887
Buckle up!

672
00:45:40,897 --> 00:45:41,648
Lilly!

673
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:51,001
Sorry.

674
00:46:04,952 --> 00:46:07,246
Jackson. Hurry up! Look behind you!

675
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:10,510
Oh God.

676
00:46:15,453 --> 00:46:17,872
Get out of the way! Move it!

677
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:19,707
Hold on, dear.

678
00:46:19,717 --> 00:46:21,479
Come on, you old bags!

679
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:25,755
Tree, tree!

680
00:46:28,048 --> 00:46:28,924
God! Damn!

681
00:46:38,413 --> 00:46:39,581
Oh! My God!

682
00:46:46,327 --> 00:46:47,047
Gee

683
00:46:53,115 --> 00:46:54,471
We gotta get to Santa Monica Airport.

684
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,379
Take the freeway. It'll be half the time.

685
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:01,102
Yeah, right.

686
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:12,968
We gotta get to the other side of the freeway.

687
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:16,013
Daddy!

688
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:29,464
Dad, look! Come on!

689
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:41,872
Dad, back off.

690
00:47:57,263 --> 00:47:59,807
They've just been upgraded to a 10.9 by Harvard.

691
00:47:59,817 --> 00:48:01,256
What does Caltech have to say?

692
00:48:01,454 --> 00:48:03,613
The city of Pasadena was wiped out.

693
00:48:03,978 --> 00:48:05,166
Just a few minutes ago.

694
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,814
This is coming in live

695
00:48:06,824 --> 00:48:08,524
From Coachella Valley near Joshua Tree.

696
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:11,047
That huge canyon, it was there this morning.

697
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:15,500
And 100 miles further north, for the west, same thing.

698
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:18,732
The San Andreas fault is shifting.

699
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:19,660
Yes.

700
00:48:19,671 --> 00:48:22,048
And all major Sister Faults in the bay area.

701
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:25,030
The whole Pacific Plate is destabilizing.

702
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:35,937
Come on!

703
00:48:36,854 --> 00:48:38,690
Who's that? Our pilot.

704
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:41,338
Dead pilot!

705
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:43,444
Gordon! Gordon! You can fly!

706
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:47,188
I've only had a couple of lessons in a single engine plane only.

707
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:49,210
You're the guy! No, I'm not the guy!

708
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:50,159
Trust me! You're the guy.

709
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,109
I'm not being modest about this!

710
00:48:52,464 --> 00:48:53,267
Come on, kids.

711
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:55,143
Gordon's gonna get us out of here.

712
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:57,500
That plane has multiple engines.

713
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:00,159
Jackson!

714
00:49:15,591 --> 00:49:17,322
T's and P's TNP?

715
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:17,854
What?

716
00:49:17,864 --> 00:49:19,543
Temperatures and Pressures Let's go!

717
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:20,586
My preflight check.

718
00:49:20,596 --> 00:49:23,557
Let him concentrate, Jackson. He has no experience.

719
00:49:23,912 --> 00:49:24,694
Thank you.

720
00:49:26,612 --> 00:49:27,593
Gordon! Go!

721
00:49:27,603 --> 00:49:29,480
Gordon! Go! Go! Go! Go!

722
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:33,786
We're not there yet.

723
00:49:36,403 --> 00:49:38,478
Punch it! We need 85 knots.

724
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:40,533
80 is good! Let's do it.

725
00:49:46,205 --> 00:49:48,374
Okay,okay, we're up.

726
00:49:57,352 --> 00:49:58,467
Higher, higher!

727
00:51:04,877 --> 00:51:06,149
Lilly, go sit with your brother.

728
00:51:11,665 --> 00:51:13,501
I don't understand how did you know this would happen?

729
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:16,733
It's not just California.

730
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:19,569
The whole damn world is going to shit.

731
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,739
I met this crazy guy in Yellowstone

732
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,824
But he's been right about everything so far

733
00:51:25,304 --> 00:51:27,275
He said the Government is building these ships,

734
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:28,568
Space ships, I don't know what,

735
00:51:28,578 --> 00:51:30,153
But something Space ships?

736
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:32,082
Yeah. Places where we could be safe.

737
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:34,720
He knows where they are. He's got a map.

738
00:51:35,272 --> 00:51:36,096
Jackson

739
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,109
Kate, trust me on this,

740
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:40,830
okay, Guys. Look.

741
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,108
But it ain't the end of the world, buddy.

742
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,089
It's only the end of this song.

743
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,270
But it ain't the end of the world, buddy.

744
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,283
It's only the end of this song.

745
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:21,016
It's been a gas, been a flip, been a hell of a trip,

746
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:26,094
But it ain't the end of the world.

747
00:52:29,076 --> 00:52:31,495
Thank you. Thank you. You got fans, Tony.

748
00:52:33,956 --> 00:52:36,052
There's a call for you, Harry. Want me to take a message?

749
00:52:36,062 --> 00:52:37,699
No, thats alright.

750
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:44,446
Yeah, hello?

751
00:52:44,967 --> 00:52:46,823
Dad? Adrian!

752
00:52:47,282 --> 00:52:50,045
Remember I told you about that dam in China?

753
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:53,976
Yeah. It's happening, Dad.

754
00:53:03,162 --> 00:53:07,187
They'd probably shoot me if they knew I told you.

755
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:10,221
Nobody's gonna shoot you, son.

756
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:11,222
They need you.

757
00:53:11,848 --> 00:53:14,851
The president has ordered us to clear out the White House.

758
00:53:15,748 --> 00:53:18,156
About time somebody cleaned up that mess.

759
00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:22,557
Where are you, Dad?

760
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,154
What exactly is the course of the Genesis right now?

761
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:28,646
It's all good, Adrian.

762
00:53:29,188 --> 00:53:31,753
Don't you be worrying about your old man.

763
00:53:32,483 --> 00:53:34,610
You have more important things to do now.

764
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:39,000
You know I

765
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,586
Your Mom and I, We

766
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:44,829
We had one hell of a great life, son.

767
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,189
And the best part about that

768
00:53:52,034 --> 00:53:54,891
We had one hell of a great kid, too.

769
00:53:58,051 --> 00:53:59,052
Look at here,

770
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:03,389
This Genesis is a pretty big ship, son.

771
00:54:04,682 --> 00:54:08,217
Don't you write your old man off just yet.

772
00:54:09,385 --> 00:54:10,511
Besides

773
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:14,035
You know I couldn't leave Tony alone.

774
00:54:14,901 --> 00:54:18,894
That old fool can't keep decent time by himself.

775
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:22,627
I love you, Dad.

776
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:32,637
I love you too, son. God knows I do.

777
00:54:46,276 --> 00:54:48,455
Herb, I want a double.

778
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:51,990
Harry I need a double right now.

779
00:54:57,099 --> 00:54:57,975
Thank you, son.

780
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,252
After 25 year I know, Wagon.

781
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:06,098
Are you out of your mind?

782
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:23,542
What are you doing? Gotta go.

783
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:24,981
That's against regulation!

784
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:26,524
Careful careful

785
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:31,978
Anything?

786
00:55:32,186 --> 00:55:33,438
Yeah, there's fuel. Fill her up.

787
00:55:33,448 --> 00:55:34,345
I'm gonna to find Charlie.

788
00:55:34,355 --> 00:55:36,222
Daddy, wait, I wanna come with you!

789
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,015
No! Lil, no!

790
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:38,933
It's alright, I'll take her.

791
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:40,132
Just fill it up. I'll be right back.

792
00:55:40,142 --> 00:55:41,717
Jackson, hurry please!

793
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:46,180
I'm standing here at the highest point of what is the

794
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:51,894
Rim of the worlds largest super volcano, mount big horn.

795
00:55:51,904 --> 00:55:52,425
Charlie!

796
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:56,721
I can only hope that all of you have made your peace Chalie.

797
00:55:57,462 --> 00:56:01,872
I can only hope that all of you have made your peace

798
00:56:01,883 --> 00:56:03,103
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

799
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:04,125
Let's go back, Daddy.

800
00:56:04,135 --> 00:56:07,117
No no no we gotta find Charlie, cause he's got a map.

801
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:09,171
It's like a secret map. Like in pirate movies.

802
00:56:09,307 --> 00:56:11,132
We gotta work as a team, okay?

803
00:56:11,257 --> 00:56:12,643
Okay Okay, come on.

804
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:16,043
Call Mom. Tell her we're gonna be 5 minutes late.

805
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:23,123
Hello. I need to talk to Mom.

806
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,771
It's Lilly. Sweety, where are you?

807
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,378
Hi Mommy Let me speak to Daddy

808
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:31,506
He can't talk right now. He's driving really fast.

809
00:56:33,112 --> 00:56:33,873
Ouch!

810
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:35,103
Lilly?

811
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:38,263
Who is that? Who's speaking in the car?

812
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,797
He's not in the car, he's on a mountain waiting for fireworks.

813
00:56:41,725 --> 00:56:42,976
Fireworks? What fireworks?

814
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:44,665
Daddy, over there.

815
00:56:47,689 --> 00:56:48,794
Good job, Lilly.

816
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:52,266
Let me talk to Mom now.

817
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,978
Hey! We got him. Bring back my child now!

818
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:01,578
You stay here.

819
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,612
I will go talk to the pirate, okay? Okay.

820
00:57:13,152 --> 00:57:14,038
Charlie!

821
00:57:15,967 --> 00:57:16,551
Charlie!

822
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:19,429
What are you doing? I thought you were toast.

823
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:21,452
No no no! Where are the space ships?

824
00:57:21,462 --> 00:57:23,819
No way you can make it there.

825
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:25,414
We have a plane. You can come with us.

826
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:26,957
But we gotta leave right now!

827
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:37,948
Fly birdies!

828
00:57:40,533 --> 00:57:41,680
Is this your kid?

829
00:57:43,234 --> 00:57:44,996
Where's the God damn map? Where is it?

830
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:48,166
Where's the map?

831
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:51,784
It's in the camper. Where in the camper?

832
00:57:51,816 --> 00:57:55,392
Map section. On the conspiracy shelf.

833
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:56,987
Dewey decimal system.

834
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:02,847
Between Roswell And Marilyn Monroe?

835
00:58:11,763 --> 00:58:12,920
It's starting.

836
00:58:21,825 --> 00:58:23,316
You sure you don't wanna come with me?

837
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,955
So beautiful, I'm gonna stay.

838
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:29,655
Good luck.

839
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:38,904
This marks the last day of the United States of America

840
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:43,211
final hour of all mankind.

841
00:58:43,774 --> 00:58:49,498
As we will be visible from the milky way as a tiny little puff of smoke.

842
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:53,919
I'm watching the earth crumble before my eyes.

843
00:58:55,588 --> 00:59:00,905
The giant ash cloud created by this super volcano

844
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:05,514
Will first envelop Vegas, and then St. Louis

845
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:12,010
And then Chicago, and then at long last, Washington D.C.

846
00:59:12,021 --> 00:59:14,763
Will have its lights go out.

847
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,358
That guy is crazy, right Daddy?

848
00:59:16,546 --> 00:59:17,505
Don't think so.

849
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:21,989
This is ridiculous.

850
00:59:22,448 --> 00:59:23,564
It's been over half an hour.

851
00:59:24,002 --> 00:59:26,066
The guy is a nut job. Stop it.

852
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:28,037
Noah, give me the phone again.

853
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,593
Daddy. What was that?

854
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,543
Nothing. Nothing.

855
00:59:56,753 --> 00:59:59,443
I have goosebumps, people!

856
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,489
I wish you could see what I'm seeing, people.

857
01:00:24,739 --> 01:00:27,575
I wish you could be here with me!

858
01:00:28,066 --> 01:00:29,609
Oh, baby!

859
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,966
Bring it on!

860
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:40,547
You heard it first from Charlie!

861
01:00:55,259 --> 01:00:56,761
Daddy, it's following us!

862
01:00:56,771 --> 01:00:59,733
Get down on the ground and hold on.

863
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,465
Don't look back. Just look at me.

864
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:03,956
Do I look scared? Uhum.

865
01:01:09,346 --> 01:01:11,161
Hold on baby. Hold on tight.

866
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:19,878
Daddy, we're on fire!

867
01:01:28,835 --> 01:01:30,075
There they are!

868
01:01:36,311 --> 01:01:39,137
It's them. It's them!

869
01:01:40,888 --> 01:01:41,962
Mommy!

870
01:01:45,779 --> 01:01:46,415
Shit.

871
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:54,360
Oh, Dady

872
01:01:54,371 --> 01:01:56,049
Hang on baby. Hang on.

873
01:02:20,146 --> 01:02:22,305
Lil, grab my hand. Come on, Noah.

874
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:23,493
Lilly, you okay?

875
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:30,563
Everybody on? Ready? Jackson!

876
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:35,276
Where is he? What's he doing?

877
01:02:35,287 --> 01:02:36,225
No!

878
01:02:49,947 --> 01:02:52,085
Daddy! No!

879
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,372
Hey. We have to go.

880
01:02:58,476 --> 01:02:59,853
No, we're not going anywhere!

881
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:01,094
Kids, buckle up. We're leaving.

882
01:03:01,104 --> 01:03:03,408
He's my Dad. We're gonna wait!

883
01:03:08,966 --> 01:03:09,821
No!

884
01:03:10,885 --> 01:03:12,146
Daddy!

885
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:19,112
Wait! Wait. Roland, I see something.

886
01:03:19,122 --> 01:03:19,987
Dad!

887
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:26,567
It's Daddy!

888
01:03:30,915 --> 01:03:31,843
Slow down!

889
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:36,056
Jackson, Reach for my hand!

890
01:03:36,129 --> 01:03:37,620
Jackson! Dad!

891
01:03:39,893 --> 01:03:41,009
We're running out of runway.

892
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:42,865
For God's sakes, Kate, pull him up.

893
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:44,502
Reach for my hand!

894
01:03:44,627 --> 01:03:46,597
Daddy! Come on!

895
01:03:47,098 --> 01:03:48,297
Daddy!

896
01:03:52,656 --> 01:03:54,074
Right. Here we go!

897
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:57,629
Faster. Faster.

898
01:04:17,576 --> 01:04:18,452
Hang on

899
01:04:39,786 --> 01:04:42,706
Okay. We're good. We're good.

900
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:51,506
So, now you got your map, where are we going?

901
01:04:57,168 --> 01:05:00,056
China

902
01:05:02,538 --> 01:05:04,123
We're gonna need a bigger plane.

903
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,404
You just said that, Mom. You just said that.

904
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:16,771
You don't remember that you just said that?

905
01:05:17,136 --> 01:05:19,555
That's okay.

906
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:24,758
Listen, Mom. I'll call you next week, same time.

907
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:28,793
Okay? Take care now. Take care of yourself.

908
01:05:32,276 --> 01:05:36,155
Sir. I think you need to see this.

909
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:44,486
I thought they'd give you an extra ticket, sir.

910
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:45,341
They did.

911
01:05:46,165 --> 01:05:50,242
But my mother is almost 89. She's in a wheelchair.

912
01:05:50,565 --> 01:05:51,827
And she is easily confused.

913
01:05:51,837 --> 01:05:55,789
And I am confident that she'll want to meet her maker on her own terms.

914
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,551
Okay? Yes, sir.

915
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,897
Who are you bringing? Nobody.

916
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:03,693
My ex-wife said she never wanted to see me again.

917
01:06:03,703 --> 01:06:04,777
So be it.

918
01:06:04,955 --> 01:06:06,831
We could bring people that contribute.

919
01:06:07,144 --> 01:06:11,273
has been damaged by a series of major earthquakes.

920
01:06:11,284 --> 01:06:14,349
The death toll is expected to be well over 2 million people.

921
01:06:14,839 --> 01:06:18,061
The devastation in Rio De Janeiro is beyond imagination.

922
01:06:18,218 --> 01:06:23,859
Two 8.5 tremors have left the people in the street fighting for resources.

923
01:06:23,869 --> 01:06:27,644
In the last hour we received this video from Globo News, Brazil.

924
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:30,365
What's happening? My God!

925
01:06:30,678 --> 01:06:34,912
The statue of Christ is collapsing!

926
01:06:35,068 --> 01:06:37,372
Fear and chaos have spread throughout the globe.

927
01:06:37,445 --> 01:06:41,053
As in London, where the 30th Olympic games has been suspended.

928
01:06:41,064 --> 01:06:43,660
Hundreds of thousands are marching towards to Downing Street

929
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,453
Demanding a lift of the information

930
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:47,278
Blackout proposed by the Prime Minister.

931
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:49,937
Thousands of calls to the switchboard. We had to shut it down.

932
01:06:49,947 --> 01:06:52,544
We're receiving reports from all across the globe.

933
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:57,007
Millions of distraught masses are gathering in public places everywhere,

934
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,508
Converging in desperate prayer.

935
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:01,678
Preachers of many faiths have taken their message of

936
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:04,504
The end of the world to the streets all over the U.S.

937
01:07:04,514 --> 01:07:06,871
Repent. There is still time.

938
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:09,112
Kind of calling when you realize the nightmare

939
01:07:09,123 --> 01:07:11,573
With the cardboard signs had it right the whole time.

940
01:07:11,584 --> 01:07:13,043
All these people out there, sir.

941
01:07:13,638 --> 01:07:15,442
Shouldn't we be issuing warnings now?

942
01:07:15,588 --> 01:07:17,579
Only when the boarding process is complete.

943
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:18,466
That's the plan.

944
01:07:18,476 --> 01:07:20,843
Which recall me 2010, remember?

945
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,054
Sir, those plans were drawn up 2 years ago.

946
01:07:24,065 --> 01:07:27,120
Okay, everybody out. Come on, get out.

947
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:31,718
Wasn't it also decided that people have the right

948
01:07:31,729 --> 01:07:33,960
To fight for their lives, best way they can?

949
01:07:34,002 --> 01:07:36,640
After we get everyone on board, Adrian.

950
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:37,756
I think that's wrong.

951
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:41,186
Want to tell everyone they're doomed?

952
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:43,334
There'd be anarchy.

953
01:07:43,689 --> 01:07:46,024
You want to jeopardize the departure of the president? Come on

954
01:07:46,035 --> 01:07:51,280
Our mission is to assure the continuity of our species.

955
01:07:52,062 --> 01:07:54,835
My question£¬can I count on you?

956
01:07:55,461 --> 01:07:56,389
Can I?

957
01:07:57,724 --> 01:07:58,537
What?

958
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,737
The Yellowstone caldera has erupted, sir.

959
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:03,615
The ash cloud will reach Washington in 7 hours.

960
01:08:05,346 --> 01:08:07,108
We've to get the president on board.

961
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:09,485
Where is the president, Sally?

962
01:08:09,496 --> 01:08:11,393
Said he wanted to spend some time alone.

963
01:08:11,435 --> 01:08:14,261
I think he's at the chapel. He's going to church now?

964
01:08:14,271 --> 01:08:18,317
He's praying, sir. Which in this circumstance is not such a bad idea.

965
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:25,856
Mr. President. I need to get you on Air Force One immediately.

966
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:29,797
Give me a moment with Adrian.

967
01:08:29,808 --> 01:08:32,133
No disrespect sir, we do not have time.

968
01:08:32,143 --> 01:08:33,259
Make time.

969
01:08:46,157 --> 01:08:48,806
Did you ever meet my wife Dorothy?

970
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:52,143
No sir, I never had that honor.

971
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:58,785
She was in and out towards the end. The night before she passed on,

972
01:08:58,795 --> 01:09:04,436
She took my hands and told me "I think you should have a monastery"

973
01:09:06,031 --> 01:09:09,170
"Everyone should have a chance to go"

974
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:14,227
Maybe that's what we should have done.

975
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:21,662
I'll be the last president of the United States of America.

976
01:09:22,527 --> 01:09:24,143
Do you know how that feels, son?

977
01:09:25,676 --> 01:09:27,960
No one could have saved the country, sir.

978
01:09:30,035 --> 01:09:34,018
And I think, I think people have a right to know.

979
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,240
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

980
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:40,952
Go on now.

981
01:09:43,037 --> 01:09:44,612
Not without you, sir.

982
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:48,511
Get on that plane, son.

983
01:09:49,335 --> 01:09:52,703
It's a great new world you head into and

984
01:09:53,016 --> 01:09:57,917
A young scientist will be worth 20 old politicians.

985
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:18,781
We should go to my parents house in the Rockies.

986
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:22,003
This isn't one of your crazy stories, now. Right, Jackson?

987
01:10:22,045 --> 01:10:23,390
How the hell are we going to make it to China?

988
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,027
Hey, Gordon without Jackson.

989
01:10:25,038 --> 01:10:26,643
We wouldn't have made it out of California.

990
01:10:26,654 --> 01:10:27,832
Noah, please.

991
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:38,833
Be careful with the landing gear!

992
01:10:38,843 --> 01:10:40,960
Easy Gringo, I know what I'm doing.

993
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:41,825
Attention!

994
01:10:41,898 --> 01:10:44,255
The national guard has informed us that an extremely

995
01:10:44,265 --> 01:10:47,310
Hazardous ash cloud is headed for the city of Las Vegas.

996
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,863
Where are you going?

997
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,753
Move! You can't stay here.

998
01:10:52,763 --> 01:10:55,099
I have a plane here. It's not safe.

999
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:08,581
So you got positive confirmation on this?

1000
01:11:10,197 --> 01:11:11,396
Thank you, I understand.

1001
01:11:22,762 --> 01:11:24,034
The president is not coming.

1002
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:35,097
So, the captain won't abandon his sinking ship.

1003
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:38,642
That's his choice, and a noble one.

1004
01:11:39,456 --> 01:11:42,865
I have also just learned that the vice president's Chopper

1005
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:46,066
went down in the ash cloud outside Pittsburgh.

1006
01:11:47,307 --> 01:11:50,727
Fortunately, we have protocols to follow.

1007
01:11:51,343 --> 01:11:52,656
What about the speaker of the House?

1008
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:54,262
In this chaos, I have no idea. Where is he?

1009
01:11:54,273 --> 01:11:55,931
He's the commander in chief now, sir.

1010
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:56,660
I don't know what to tell you

1011
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,881
This is one flight he shouldn't be late for.

1012
01:11:59,841 --> 01:12:00,894
Tell the captain we're taking off.

1013
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,593
Sir, you don't have the authority.

1014
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:04,950
Who got the authority? You? You got the authority?

1015
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,088
You couldn't even keep your damn mouth shut.

1016
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,663
You betrayed top secret information last year.

1017
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:10,810
What the hell are you talking about?

1018
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:14,115
You told your father everything, put this entire plan in jeopardy,

1019
01:12:14,126 --> 01:12:17,066
Good thing for you the old man could keep his mouth shut better than you.

1020
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,849
Come on! Don't look so shocked.

1021
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,205
We had to monitor everybody who knew,

1022
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:21,842
How do you think we kept it a secret for so long?

1023
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:24,219
So you just killed anybody who tried to talk?

1024
01:12:25,126 --> 01:12:28,286
Anybody who tried to talk was not just an enemy of the state.

1025
01:12:28,296 --> 01:12:29,474
They were an enemy of humanity.

1026
01:12:29,485 --> 01:12:31,935
The director of the Louvre was an enemy of humanity?

1027
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:34,135
After he called a press conference he was.

1028
01:12:35,293 --> 01:12:37,305
Jesus, what did you think?

1029
01:12:37,316 --> 01:12:40,538
We're all just gonna get on board, hold hands and sing Kumbaya?

1030
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:43,155
Sit down and buckle up.

1031
01:12:53,259 --> 01:12:55,344
Excuse me, is my father in the command center?

1032
01:12:56,293 --> 01:12:58,034
President is on the line, Dr Wilson.

1033
01:13:00,036 --> 01:13:00,797
Thank you.

1034
01:13:08,034 --> 01:13:09,004
Where are you?

1035
01:13:09,483 --> 01:13:12,424
You never would've gotten on that plane if I told you.

1036
01:13:15,531 --> 01:13:18,534
But you said that you'd be here Darling, listen to me.

1037
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:21,297
Do you understand how much strength it gives me

1038
01:13:21,912 --> 01:13:23,643
knowing that you will survive?

1039
01:13:25,426 --> 01:13:31,151
The only thing left to do now, is tell the truth to people.

1040
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:39,847
At least if they know, families can say goodbye to each other.

1041
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:43,736
A mother can comfort her children.

1042
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:47,438
And a father

1043
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:52,683
Can ask his daughter for forgiveness.

1044
01:14:02,453 --> 01:14:04,152
Whenever you're ready, Mr President.

1045
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:18,761
My fellow Americans this will be the last time I address you.

1046
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:24,788
As you know, catastrophe has struck our nation.

1047
01:14:26,581 --> 01:14:28,239
Has struck the world.

1048
01:14:29,073 --> 01:14:33,619
I wish I could tell you we could prevent the coming destruction.

1049
01:14:34,902 --> 01:14:36,091
We cannot.

1050
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:39,771
Today, none of us are strangers.

1051
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:47,206
Today, we are one family, stepping into the darkness together.

1052
01:14:47,998 --> 01:14:50,626
We are a nation of many religions,

1053
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:57,060
But I believe these words reflect the spirit

1054
01:14:57,904 --> 01:14:59,896
"The Lord is my shepard."

1055
01:14:59,906 --> 01:15:00,938
I shall

1056
01:15:02,805 --> 01:15:05,506
People! Get away from the doors and windows.

1057
01:15:06,381 --> 01:15:08,331
What are we gonna do? You tell me.

1058
01:15:08,686 --> 01:15:11,553
Dr Silberman? Tamara!

1059
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:13,263
What are you doing here?

1060
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,443
She's a patient, honey.

1061
01:15:15,599 --> 01:15:18,873
Excuse me, I have a private plane out there.

1062
01:15:18,883 --> 01:15:20,948
Karpov! Yuri!

1063
01:15:21,532 --> 01:15:24,399
You knew. This whole time you knew.

1064
01:15:24,577 --> 01:15:27,037
You've got a way out of here, right? You got a plane?

1065
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:29,613
My family, take us with you. Please!

1066
01:15:29,957 --> 01:15:31,605
Boss, Boss.

1067
01:15:32,105 --> 01:15:34,159
I found us a plane. An Antonov.

1068
01:15:34,222 --> 01:15:36,599
They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them.

1069
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:38,997
Can you still fly that thing?

1070
01:15:39,341 --> 01:15:42,438
Sure, Boss, but I need co-pilot.

1071
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,565
Gordon's a pilot.

1072
01:15:46,223 --> 01:15:48,225
No, I'm not.

1073
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:50,530
Yes he is. great pilot. Let's go.

1074
01:15:51,061 --> 01:15:52,876
Good. Let's go!

1075
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:56,087
Jackson, stop saying I'm a pilot.

1076
01:15:58,267 --> 01:15:59,925
You can't go out there. Come back!

1077
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:07,401
Move back, People!

1078
01:16:14,126 --> 01:16:15,993
Wow, that's a big plane.

1079
01:16:16,983 --> 01:16:18,318
It's Russian.

1080
01:16:19,767 --> 01:16:21,394
Let's move everybody. Come on!

1081
01:16:26,993 --> 01:16:29,308
Gordon, where are you? Let's go!

1082
01:16:29,496 --> 01:16:31,404
Up here, Gordon. Hurry up!

1083
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:35,324
Oh my God.***

1084
01:16:42,947 --> 01:16:46,356
Woah, Look at these. Las Vegas auto show.

1085
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:49,651
We had VIP tickets for this.

1086
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,320
That's fantastic, Let's go.

1087
01:16:51,351 --> 01:16:54,052
Check the main bus for hydraulics, I'll balance the tanks.

1088
01:16:54,145 --> 01:16:54,959
What?

1089
01:16:57,159 --> 01:16:59,140
Okay, okay. I'm trying.

1090
01:17:01,632 --> 01:17:03,332
Tower to Antonov, what the hell are you doing?

1091
01:17:03,342 --> 01:17:05,104
Shut down immediately.

1092
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:13,707
Caesar, shh.

1093
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:15,219
When I say "go"

1094
01:17:15,281 --> 01:17:17,471
We push all this down at once, okay?

1095
01:17:17,523 --> 01:17:18,816
Okay. Go!

1096
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:23,060
Antonov, abort take-off. You do not have clearance.

1097
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:24,989
I repeat, you must abort.

1098
01:17:31,964 --> 01:17:32,861
What the hell was that?

1099
01:17:33,132 --> 01:17:35,061
I don't know, but it's not good.

1100
01:17:38,116 --> 01:17:40,390
Push! Pushing! Come on!

1101
01:17:44,675 --> 01:17:46,145
We're going down!

1102
01:17:55,759 --> 01:17:57,813
It must be thetake over.

1103
01:17:57,824 --> 01:17:59,784
Take over, What do you mean, take over?

1104
01:18:02,839 --> 01:18:04,591
Sasha! Relax.

1105
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:05,665
Now!

1106
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:11,650
God, God, Jesus.

1107
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:16,853
Oh, God

1108
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:19,575
Sasha, now! Take a deep breath.

1109
01:18:19,898 --> 01:18:21,212
Pull!

1110
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:27,030
Come up, baby

1111
01:18:48,572 --> 01:18:49,865
Was that the Eiffel Tower?

1112
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:52,337
I think so.

1113
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:04,213
Ladies and gentlemen. We're on our way to China.

1114
01:19:06,903 --> 01:19:09,239
Good. Very good.

1115
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:23,701
Do not believe in something simply because you have heard it, Nima.

1116
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:27,987
But Great Lama. Tenzin is my brother.

1117
01:19:28,925 --> 01:19:31,699
He works inside the big tunnel, where the ships are built.

1118
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:39,561
But what is there in your wisdom, Great Lama, if Tenzin is right?

1119
01:19:40,176 --> 01:19:42,501
What if our world is indeed coming to and end?

1120
01:19:52,647 --> 01:19:57,954
It is full, Great Rinpoche.

1121
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:09,007
Like this cup, you are full of opinions and speculations.

1122
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:14,231
To see the light of wisdom, you first must empty your cup.

1123
01:20:32,165 --> 01:20:33,500
Be careful with the clutch

1124
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:36,566
It tends to slip.

1125
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:58,150
Grandma Grandpa, Nima is here!

1126
01:20:58,327 --> 01:21:00,058
Grandma, I got a message from Tenzin

1127
01:21:00,392 --> 01:21:03,436
He want us to meet him in Cho Ming at the work camp.

1128
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:07,044
He says he can get us onto the ships he's working on.

1129
01:21:07,055 --> 01:21:09,098
What are you talking about?

1130
01:21:09,109 --> 01:21:11,309
Tenzin works on the dam.

1131
01:21:14,687 --> 01:21:15,563
Grandma

1132
01:21:16,272 --> 01:21:19,859
the dam is a ship. The government lied to us.

1133
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:22,059
There will be a big flood!

1134
01:21:22,831 --> 01:21:24,697
We must pack up right away.

1135
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:28,347
Nima? Who gave you a truck? Grandpa

1136
01:21:28,357 --> 01:21:34,905
We took a trip on the liam song ferry once grandpa threw up the whole way.

1137
01:21:35,781 --> 01:21:37,262
Let's eat first.

1138
01:21:43,685 --> 01:21:47,136
Hey, Look, the new Bentley! Our father had one on order.

1139
01:21:47,376 --> 01:21:49,357
He was supposed to get it next year.

1140
01:21:49,764 --> 01:21:52,371
But then he canceled it. Because of the ships.

1141
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:55,217
How many cars does your family have?

1142
01:21:56,531 --> 01:21:58,637
My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche.

1143
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:01,432
Our parents are divorced too.

1144
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:04,216
Yeah, but there is nothing that we can do about that.

1145
01:22:04,247 --> 01:22:05,092
Found a hat.

1146
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:07,448
She has a thing for hats.

1147
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:10,170
I was just like that at her age.

1148
01:22:10,775 --> 01:22:12,203
They made me feel safe.

1149
01:22:13,611 --> 01:22:16,718
So, how did you meet Dr Silberman?

1150
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:19,919
As you can see not the same way you did.

1151
01:22:22,057 --> 01:22:27,281
My boyfriend asked me to get them done. But he's not your husband?

1152
01:22:27,593 --> 01:22:29,877
Oh, no, We are not married.

1153
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:31,660
And probably never will be.

1154
01:22:39,856 --> 01:22:40,721
For the boys.

1155
01:22:46,185 --> 01:22:48,083
They seem to like each other.

1156
01:22:50,356 --> 01:22:51,649
Yeah, I guess.

1157
01:22:53,859 --> 01:22:56,091
Tell me, Mr Karpov, how much did you pay?

1158
01:22:57,498 --> 01:23:00,918
One billion Euro. Per seat.

1159
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:05,235
That's disgusting Oh yeah?

1160
01:23:06,591 --> 01:23:10,115
You know, Curtis, I wasn't always a businessman.

1161
01:23:10,616 --> 01:23:12,420
I am a boxer.

1162
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:16,663
Was my only playing when I was boy back in Murmansk.

1163
01:23:16,768 --> 01:23:20,865
And my coach, his name was also Yuri.

1164
01:23:21,189 --> 01:23:26,705
He always say "If someone wants to beat you"

1165
01:23:26,851 --> 01:23:28,915
"he has to kill you first"

1166
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:33,868
That's very nice.

1167
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:41,386
yeah. But tell me, what would you have done if you were rich like me?

1168
01:23:41,928 --> 01:23:44,848
Look, they are wonderful children.

1169
01:23:47,142 --> 01:23:51,949
Ok guys. The plan is to refill in Hawaii, so sit down and buckle up.

1170
01:23:52,376 --> 01:23:53,627
Gordon and I will do the rest.

1171
01:23:57,152 --> 01:23:58,017
Oh God.

1172
01:24:00,342 --> 01:24:01,469
Go get the guys.

1173
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:08,079
Guys, there's ayou might wanna

1174
01:24:26,838 --> 01:24:31,061
What is that? The state of Hawaii.

1175
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:35,336
Not good. That is not good.

1176
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:41,894
How much fuel do we have left?

1177
01:24:42,437 --> 01:24:43,406
Not enough.

1178
01:24:43,886 --> 01:24:47,681
We have to make a water landing somewhere in south China sea.

1179
01:24:48,067 --> 01:24:50,643
Great, at least we won't need a landing gear.

1180
01:24:50,789 --> 01:24:53,635
What about it? We lost it all, in Vegas.

1181
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:06,638
Dr Wilson, may I come in?

1182
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:09,599
I'm not very good company, I'm afraid.

1183
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:13,749
Doctor Please, call me Adrian.

1184
01:25:19,682 --> 01:25:21,424
All those people we left behind.

1185
01:25:22,727 --> 01:25:24,447
They don't stand a chance, do they?

1186
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:30,516
I believe that nature will choose for itself, from itself,

1187
01:25:30,787 --> 01:25:31,976
What will survive.

1188
01:25:33,853 --> 01:25:36,657
Just like you, preserving those great artworks.

1189
01:25:37,867 --> 01:25:41,537
Our culture is our soul, and that's not dying tonight.

1190
01:25:41,652 --> 01:25:45,229
Come on, I contributed to this cover up.

1191
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:49,107
The Da Vinci, Picasso, they're in.

1192
01:25:49,483 --> 01:25:51,245
But if you're some nobody you don't stand a chance.

1193
01:25:51,255 --> 01:25:55,072
It's not necessarily true.

1194
01:25:56,678 --> 01:26:00,525
Did you ever hear of a writer called Jackson Curtis?

1195
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:02,798
Wrote a book, "Farewell Atlantis".

1196
01:26:03,903 --> 01:26:06,552
What do you think the chances are of an unknown writer

1197
01:26:06,562 --> 01:26:09,826
Who barely sold 500 copies making it aboard this plane?

1198
01:26:11,911 --> 01:26:15,926
I don't understand I mean call it chance or faith or nature,

1199
01:26:15,936 --> 01:26:19,805
Doesn't matter this book is part of our legacy now. Why?

1200
01:26:20,952 --> 01:26:22,224
Because I'm reading it.

1201
01:26:26,635 --> 01:26:29,992
Dr Helmsley, please report to the situation room.

1202
01:26:42,838 --> 01:26:43,808
Who is it?

1203
01:26:43,818 --> 01:26:47,343
Hello, I'm sorry. Who is this?

1204
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:49,011
This is Yoko Delgado.

1205
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:51,326
Do you want to speak to my Daddy?

1206
01:26:54,652 --> 01:26:55,768
Yes, please.

1207
01:26:56,227 --> 01:26:57,718
Who should I say is calling?

1208
01:27:01,826 --> 01:27:06,654
Tell him, its his father. You're my grandpa?

1209
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,188
Yes, sweetheart, I am.

1210
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:14,088
Daddy, grandpa is on the phone.

1211
01:28:18,246 --> 01:28:19,518
Mr President, Sir.

1212
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:29,904
What's the matter, sweety? She can't find her Daddy.

1213
01:28:32,677 --> 01:28:35,347
Why don't you two get comfy on that couch?

1214
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:37,067
Sally, come here

1215
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,268
I'll find your Daddy.

1216
01:28:48,714 --> 01:28:50,080
Who can help me with missing persons?

1217
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:51,853
Sorry, man, I'm really busy right now.

1218
01:28:53,646 --> 01:28:57,348
I mean of course, sir. Sorry, Mr President.

1219
01:28:57,358 --> 01:28:59,569
Don't worry about it, you're doing a great job, son.

1220
01:29:26,512 --> 01:29:28,775
What's happening? The capital has been hit by a 9.4

1221
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:30,370
Lost communication with the White House, sir.

1222
01:29:30,381 --> 01:29:32,591
Where is it centered? North Chesapeake bay.

1223
01:29:37,221 --> 01:29:40,453
Mr Anheuser, Russian president on the line, sir.

1224
01:29:41,069 --> 01:29:41,757
Excuse me.

1225
01:29:42,883 --> 01:29:44,530
We just entered Chinese air space.

1226
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,107
That's affirmative, Mr President.

1227
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:53,612
Until communication is restored, I suppose I am in command.

1228
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,866
It appears that all other heads of state are en route,

1229
01:29:56,876 --> 01:29:59,347
With the exception of the Italian Prime Minister,

1230
01:30:00,254 --> 01:30:04,894
Who has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer.

1231
01:31:12,212 --> 01:31:14,464
Earths crust has begun to shift, Dr Helmsley!

1232
01:31:14,474 --> 01:31:17,425
By what degree? 1.2 degree. Still moving.

1233
01:31:17,436 --> 01:31:18,791
So, what happens next?

1234
01:31:18,937 --> 01:31:21,534
The movement of our land masses comes to a halt.

1235
01:31:21,648 --> 01:31:22,983
Let's see a simulation.

1236
01:31:24,193 --> 01:31:26,497
Expect the formation of gigantic tsunamis.

1237
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:29,114
Proportional to the magnitude of corresponding quakes.

1238
01:31:34,995 --> 01:31:36,768
Pull up the Japanese sea border.

1239
01:31:36,945 --> 01:31:37,675
Yes, sir.

1240
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:41,095
My Dad's on a cruise ship out there.

1241
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,598
But I guess you already knew that.

1242
01:31:46,298 --> 01:31:48,436
Sir, we've recorded two underwater quakes

1243
01:31:48,446 --> 01:31:50,239
At 7.9 and 8.2.

1244
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:09,081
From what we have just learned,

1245
01:32:09,092 --> 01:32:12,553
Tokyo seems to have taken the full force of the earthquake.

1246
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:14,858
At this point unconfirmed reports Indicate that

1247
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:17,611
Large areas of land are under water.

1248
01:32:17,923 --> 01:32:19,519
Please stay tuned for further

1249
01:32:29,821 --> 01:32:33,116
Tony I called.

1250
01:32:37,286 --> 01:32:38,517
I was too late.

1251
01:32:43,386 --> 01:32:45,837
Maybe they got out of town.

1252
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:48,245
You never know.

1253
01:34:16,323 --> 01:34:18,273
I'm coming home, Dorothy.

1254
01:34:45,258 --> 01:34:46,103
Anything?

1255
01:34:48,157 --> 01:34:49,283
Nothing but static.

1256
01:34:49,846 --> 01:34:51,421
Not even an emergency signal.

1257
01:35:05,007 --> 01:35:07,072
Can't think about what's going on down there.

1258
01:35:14,569 --> 01:35:16,550
Remember that old beetle we used to camp in?

1259
01:35:16,696 --> 01:35:17,801
But you'd never get the roof up.

1260
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,732
We definitely traded up.

1261
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:27,363
I tried to find our old spot at Yellowstone.

1262
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:29,584
When I went camping with the kids, but

1263
01:35:30,971 --> 01:35:32,045
I couldn't find it.

1264
01:35:41,127 --> 01:35:42,555
Do you think people change?

1265
01:35:43,931 --> 01:35:45,214
By people, do you mean me?

1266
01:35:45,756 --> 01:35:46,622
Yes.

1267
01:35:46,872 --> 01:35:48,853
Do you think you've changed since we separated?

1268
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:52,940
I seem to eat a lot more cereal now.

1269
01:35:57,601 --> 01:35:59,134
You always had tunnel vision.

1270
01:36:00,594 --> 01:36:02,700
You could just block everything out and write.

1271
01:36:07,288 --> 01:36:08,592
You blocked us out.

1272
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:19,457
Do you love him?

1273
01:36:22,835 --> 01:36:23,888
I love him enough.

1274
01:36:37,172 --> 01:36:39,602
All global ground communication is ceased, sir.

1275
01:36:44,367 --> 01:36:48,058
The only signals our satellites are picking up from Cho Ming.

1276
01:36:49,758 --> 01:36:51,176
Well there's a piece of good news.

1277
01:36:52,052 --> 01:36:53,261
Any updates, Doctor?

1278
01:36:53,459 --> 01:36:56,733
We expect the tsunamis to reach land fall on every continent.

1279
01:36:56,744 --> 01:37:00,331
The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately 6 hours.

1280
01:37:01,843 --> 01:37:03,229
It looks like the crust have shifted

1281
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,191
By almost 23 degrees to the southwest.

1282
01:37:07,108 --> 01:37:11,488
The data also shows the earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields.

1283
01:37:12,259 --> 01:37:15,064
These are their new positions.see here?***

1284
01:37:16,785 --> 01:37:21,529
You're telling me that the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin?

1285
01:37:22,123 --> 01:37:24,563
Actually, thats the south pole now.

1286
01:37:33,187 --> 01:37:35,553
Engine failure. 2 of 6 are down.

1287
01:37:35,564 --> 01:37:36,878
You must get ready.

1288
01:37:38,671 --> 01:37:41,549
How long do we have? 18 minutes. Maybe.

1289
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:45,355
Better wake up the kids.

1290
01:38:26,594 --> 01:38:28,002
Why do you hate Gordon?

1291
01:38:32,673 --> 01:38:35,582
Hey. Come on.

1292
01:38:37,563 --> 01:38:41,025
What are you talking about? I don't hate him.

1293
01:38:41,463 --> 01:38:46,343
You don't like him either. That's because I don't know him well, maybe.

1294
01:38:46,499 --> 01:38:47,782
But I do.

1295
01:38:48,011 --> 01:38:50,410
He's really nice once you get to know him.

1296
01:38:50,451 --> 01:38:51,807
You should talk to him more often.

1297
01:38:52,172 --> 01:38:54,226
You guys would get along really well.

1298
01:38:58,543 --> 01:38:59,648
You like him a lot, huh?

1299
01:39:08,897 --> 01:39:11,670
I'll do my best. I promise. Ok?

1300
01:39:13,568 --> 01:39:16,821
I'm really proud of you. Really proud of you.

1301
01:39:18,865 --> 01:39:22,754
Is it time? Yeah

1302
01:39:26,988 --> 01:39:27,905
Dad, what's wrong?

1303
01:39:28,959 --> 01:39:31,471
Sasha's gotta land. It's gonna be a little bumpy.

1304
01:39:31,482 --> 01:39:32,545
Maybe a little wet.

1305
01:39:33,932 --> 01:39:34,714
Daddy?

1306
01:39:41,346 --> 01:39:42,420
Hold her steady.

1307
01:40:00,407 --> 01:40:02,784
Daddy, I'm not a really good swimmer.

1308
01:40:03,076 --> 01:40:06,767
Hey, that's alright. It's what you got this for.

1309
01:40:07,372 --> 01:40:08,821
It's like being in a swimming pool.

1310
01:40:08,863 --> 01:40:13,326
Only it's got more cool stuff. It's got a whistle, a light.

1311
01:40:14,024 --> 01:40:15,505
I thought we were going to China.

1312
01:40:16,996 --> 01:40:18,331
No, we gotta land here.

1313
01:40:22,283 --> 01:40:22,950
So that's what we're gonna do.

1314
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,577
We're just gonna all stay together. Right?

1315
01:40:24,671 --> 01:40:25,901
No we're not, we're gonna die!

1316
01:40:25,911 --> 01:40:27,934
No, we're not.

1317
01:40:28,289 --> 01:40:29,196
Promise?

1318
01:40:29,613 --> 01:40:33,054
I promise you, we'll all stay together, no matter what happens.

1319
01:40:48,924 --> 01:40:49,769
Jackson,

1320
01:40:50,874 --> 01:40:51,625
Yuri.

1321
01:40:53,345 --> 01:40:54,565
I think you better come up here

1322
01:40:55,941 --> 01:40:57,516
Hold on, hold on. I'm gonna go check this out.

1323
01:40:57,526 --> 01:40:59,747
Dad, Dad! I'll be right back.

1324
01:41:00,946 --> 01:41:02,646
We gotta buckle up. Let's go.

1325
01:41:04,585 --> 01:41:07,557
Don't ask me how that happened. There is no more ocean,

1326
01:41:07,568 --> 01:41:09,955
And we're pretty close to where we wanted to go.

1327
01:41:10,049 --> 01:41:12,228
It's like the whole world shifted by 1000 miles.

1328
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:14,981
1578 to be exact.

1329
01:41:14,992 --> 01:41:17,703
It's called "Earth crust displacement theory"

1330
01:41:17,786 --> 01:41:19,527
Professor Hapgood 1958.

1331
01:41:21,019 --> 01:41:22,332
Way to go, Charlie.

1332
01:41:26,065 --> 01:41:26,753
What was that?

1333
01:41:28,265 --> 01:41:30,434
We just lost our last two engines.

1334
01:41:49,432 --> 01:41:52,227
I'll shoot for that glacier.It's going to get rocky.

1335
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:56,106
Listen, it's gonna sound crazy, but here's what you have to do.

1336
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,884
Get up! Follow me!

1337
01:42:03,957 --> 01:42:06,168
Yuri, what are you doing?

1338
01:42:06,418 --> 01:42:08,837
We are taking the Bentley!

1339
01:42:10,193 --> 01:42:12,643
Not yet! Not yet.

1340
01:42:13,133 --> 01:42:15,855
Almost there.

1341
01:42:17,252 --> 01:42:18,096
Get in the car.

1342
01:42:28,961 --> 01:42:31,464
Okay, go now! Pull!

1343
01:42:36,208 --> 01:42:38,523
No no no no no

1344
01:42:42,454 --> 01:42:43,257
Go, Jackson.

1345
01:42:43,267 --> 01:42:45,144
We gotta wait for Sasha and Gordon.

1346
01:42:46,521 --> 01:42:50,212
Go! Make sure everybody gets off the plane before I touch down.

1347
01:42:50,274 --> 01:42:51,202
What about you?

1348
01:42:51,734 --> 01:42:55,102
I'll be fine. I have to touch this plane down.

1349
01:42:56,625 --> 01:43:00,848
What are you waiting for? Go!

1350
01:43:15,675 --> 01:43:17,020
There he is. I see him!

1351
01:43:17,948 --> 01:43:19,157
Come on lets go.

1352
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:19,950
Where is Sasha?

1353
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,045
He said he's fine.

1354
01:43:21,243 --> 01:43:22,828
We should get out of here before he touches down.

1355
01:43:22,838 --> 01:43:25,862
No, don't go! We should wait for him No no no no

1356
01:43:25,873 --> 01:43:27,551
Go Jackson, go.

1357
01:43:29,491 --> 01:43:30,419
It won't start.

1358
01:43:32,379 --> 01:43:34,548
Shut up everybody!

1359
01:43:36,268 --> 01:43:39,939
Engine start.

1360
01:43:43,056 --> 01:43:45,632
Voice control. Sold me on it.

1361
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:51,372
Welcome, to the People's Republic of China.

1362
01:45:51,685 --> 01:45:53,781
Good to be here. Say hi, kids.

1363
01:45:55,512 --> 01:45:58,108
What color are your passes? What?

1364
01:45:58,494 --> 01:46:00,392
What color are your boarding passes?

1365
01:46:02,665 --> 01:46:04,104
I have green cards.

1366
01:46:05,209 --> 01:46:07,711
For my boys and me. What?

1367
01:46:11,914 --> 01:46:13,561
Yuri? Yuri!

1368
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:17,179
Yuri. It's a mistake. A joke, eh?

1369
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:23,686
What? You think I didn't know about you and Sasha?

1370
01:46:24,781 --> 01:46:28,295
May God bless that poor bastard's soul.

1371
01:46:33,644 --> 01:46:36,605
I'm sorry guys. Good luck.

1372
01:46:38,002 --> 01:46:39,160
Come on, boys.

1373
01:46:41,308 --> 01:46:43,289
Maybe with money we could bribe them. I do, I do.

1374
01:46:43,664 --> 01:46:45,113
You got a billion Euros?

1375
01:46:50,056 --> 01:46:51,015
Dr Wilson.

1376
01:46:51,818 --> 01:46:54,498
I'm captain Michaels, skipper of the American ship.

1377
01:46:54,675 --> 01:46:56,927
Please accept my sincere condolences for your father.

1378
01:46:56,938 --> 01:46:58,074
Thank you, captain.

1379
01:46:59,909 --> 01:47:02,860
Mr. Anheuser. Your party is the last to arrive.

1380
01:47:07,292 --> 01:47:09,774
There's been reports of severe damage, captain.

1381
01:47:09,899 --> 01:47:11,703
What's the status of ark number 3?

1382
01:47:11,713 --> 01:47:13,736
We haven't done a complete assessment yet.

1383
01:47:14,226 --> 01:47:15,832
Looks like we lost it.

1384
01:47:26,029 --> 01:47:28,271
No toothbrush. Only books.

1385
01:47:29,814 --> 01:47:32,505
When I was a kid my Dad was on the road a lot.

1386
01:47:33,839 --> 01:47:35,747
He'd always leave me a box full of books.

1387
01:47:35,758 --> 01:47:37,384
Call me every night and cruise me.

1388
01:47:38,584 --> 01:47:41,190
I'd get an ice cream cone for every book I read so

1389
01:47:42,004 --> 01:47:43,203
I was a fat kid.

1390
01:47:44,736 --> 01:47:46,425
I find that very hard to believe.

1391
01:47:46,435 --> 01:47:48,583
No, its true, my high school career

1392
01:47:48,698 --> 01:47:52,827
Was 2000 books zero girlfriends.

1393
01:47:54,673 --> 01:47:57,081
I didn't even kiss a boy until I was in college.

1394
01:47:58,041 --> 01:47:59,907
They were all too scared of my dad.

1395
01:48:48,091 --> 01:48:49,519
Leave it to the Chinese.

1396
01:48:50,176 --> 01:48:51,500
I didn't think it was possible.

1397
01:48:51,876 --> 01:48:53,127
Not in the time we had.

1398
01:48:54,576 --> 01:48:56,026
That's ark number 3, sir.

1399
01:48:56,797 --> 01:48:59,957
The roof collapsed during the shifting of the earth's crust.

1400
01:49:00,832 --> 01:49:02,313
Jesus Christ.

1401
01:49:03,669 --> 01:49:09,059
Boarding of arc 3 will be delayed due to technical difficulties.

1402
01:49:12,219 --> 01:49:13,950
Hey, what's going on here?

1403
01:49:14,023 --> 01:49:16,619
I have a green card for my boys and me.

1404
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:18,913
I want to speak to your supervisor.

1405
01:49:18,924 --> 01:49:20,373
I am the supervisor.

1406
01:49:20,383 --> 01:49:23,720
Get back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained.

1407
01:49:25,899 --> 01:49:27,776
What he said about you and Sasha, is it true?

1408
01:49:28,277 --> 01:49:31,499
Sasha was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri.

1409
01:49:32,343 --> 01:49:34,606
I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman.

1410
01:49:34,648 --> 01:49:37,244
I actually liked the way I looked before

1411
01:49:37,275 --> 01:49:39,340
That monster talked me into it.

1412
01:49:39,903 --> 01:49:41,790
Did you know he asked me for a discount?

1413
01:49:42,218 --> 01:49:43,646
He payed in installments.

1414
01:49:44,053 --> 01:49:45,523
Cheap bastard.

1415
01:49:46,295 --> 01:49:47,150
You hear that?

1416
01:49:50,497 --> 01:49:51,519
Over there!

1417
01:49:55,397 --> 01:49:56,357
Stop!

1418
01:49:56,576 --> 01:49:57,389
Stop!

1419
01:50:01,695 --> 01:50:06,221
Hi! Hi! Stop! Stop the car

1420
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:41,329
How were all these people chosen?

1421
01:50:41,464 --> 01:50:42,622
Same way your arc was.

1422
01:50:42,643 --> 01:50:43,810
By experts from all over the world.

1423
01:50:43,821 --> 01:50:45,917
We had geneticists determine the perfect gene pool

1424
01:50:45,927 --> 01:50:46,918
We need to repopulate.

1425
01:50:46,928 --> 01:50:48,909
These people were chosen by geneticists?

1426
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:53,080
All green card holders please proceed to hangar D-4

1427
01:50:53,091 --> 01:50:54,988
Looks to me like their check books got them on board.

1428
01:50:54,999 --> 01:50:56,114
That's right, Dr. Wilson.

1429
01:50:56,125 --> 01:50:58,335
Without billions of dollars from the private sector

1430
01:50:58,346 --> 01:51:00,160
This entire operation would've been impossible.

1431
01:51:00,171 --> 01:51:01,641
We sold tickets?

1432
01:51:02,392 --> 01:51:04,029
What about all these workers?

1433
01:51:04,644 --> 01:51:05,968
They all get passes?

1434
01:51:06,406 --> 01:51:09,034
What? Life isn't fair?

1435
01:51:09,357 --> 01:51:10,295
Is that it?

1436
01:51:10,556 --> 01:51:11,964
If you want to donate your passes,

1437
01:51:11,974 --> 01:51:13,496
To a couple of Chinese workers,

1438
01:51:13,507 --> 01:51:14,862
You be my guest.

1439
01:51:16,114 --> 01:51:17,636
Captain, I want a pre-launch briefing.

1440
01:51:17,678 --> 01:51:19,336
All international teams present.

1441
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,987
What the hell?

1442
01:51:59,814 --> 01:52:02,660
What is this? They could've fit 10 people in here.

1443
01:52:10,084 --> 01:52:11,325
Satnam, where are you?

1444
01:52:11,805 --> 01:52:14,537
On the Nampan Plateau. What?

1445
01:52:16,017 --> 01:52:18,061
There's a tidal wave coming from the east.

1446
01:52:18,071 --> 01:52:19,344
It's gigantic.

1447
01:52:19,781 --> 01:52:20,887
Satnam, what happened?

1448
01:52:21,554 --> 01:52:23,254
We never got picked up, Adrian.

1449
01:52:24,015 --> 01:52:25,318
The airlift never came.

1450
01:52:27,414 --> 01:52:28,613
Goodbye, my friend.

1451
01:52:30,073 --> 01:52:35,068
Satnam, Satnam.

1452
01:52:58,758 --> 01:53:01,302
Mary Where are we set up? Over there.

1453
01:53:06,234 --> 01:53:07,955
Give me the satellite images from Nampan, India.

1454
01:53:07,965 --> 01:53:08,987
Ok, right away.

1455
01:53:09,435 --> 01:53:10,301
What's happening?

1456
01:53:11,333 --> 01:53:15,118
Satnam was talking about another wave, coming from the east.

1457
01:53:19,091 --> 01:53:20,227
Holy mother of God.

1458
01:53:20,603 --> 01:53:23,241
So the flooding will hit earlier?

1459
01:53:23,251 --> 01:53:24,471
The second wave is closer?

1460
01:53:24,482 --> 01:53:25,618
Plug in the new data.

1461
01:53:27,714 --> 01:53:29,257
Satnam didn't get picked up.

1462
01:53:29,403 --> 01:53:30,154
What?

1463
01:53:30,331 --> 01:53:32,907
A lot of people didn't get picked up in this chaos.

1464
01:53:33,355 --> 01:53:35,472
This is not a conspiracy, Helmsley.

1465
01:53:35,524 --> 01:53:39,319
Your predictions haven't exactly panned out, have they, doctor?

1466
01:53:39,851 --> 01:53:40,612
It's ready.

1467
01:53:42,854 --> 01:53:44,585
Oh God, its 1500 meters high.

1468
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:47,150
When will it get here?

1469
01:53:47,765 --> 01:53:49,288
Talk to me, Hemsley, when will it hit?

1470
01:53:49,298 --> 01:53:50,320
Adjust the countdown.

1471
01:54:07,306 --> 01:54:10,455
28 minutes, 10 seconds to impact.

1472
01:54:10,663 --> 01:54:11,445
My God.

1473
01:54:11,768 --> 01:54:12,550
Captain.

1474
01:54:13,478 --> 01:54:15,241
I need to speak to the other heads of state immediately.

1475
01:54:15,251 --> 01:54:15,772
Right away.

1476
01:54:15,783 --> 01:54:17,931
Taylor? Aye, captain standing by.

1477
01:54:17,941 --> 01:54:20,621
Ark 6, stand by. Ark 7, stand by.

1478
01:54:20,631 --> 01:54:23,197
This is Carl Anheuser Acting CIC on 4,

1479
01:54:23,207 --> 01:54:23,833
Yes sir

1480
01:54:23,843 --> 01:54:26,033
Requesting emergency conference T-99.

1481
01:54:47,137 --> 01:54:48,743
He thinks the world of you, you know that?

1482
01:54:51,662 --> 01:54:52,716
He's a great little man.

1483
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:55,083
Yeah!

1484
01:55:03,758 --> 01:55:05,562
I always wanted to have a family of my own.

1485
01:55:09,941 --> 01:55:11,265
You're a lucky man, Jackson.

1486
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:13,872
Don't ever forget it.

1487
01:55:30,441 --> 01:55:31,442
Who are they?

1488
01:55:32,203 --> 01:55:33,621
We found them alongside of the road.

1489
01:55:33,736 --> 01:55:35,675
Send them back!

1490
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:45,988
I am a follower of our great lama Rinpoche.

1491
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:48,198
You know I cannot do that.

1492
01:55:50,127 --> 01:55:51,368
You don't have to take all of us.

1493
01:55:51,378 --> 01:55:52,807
Please just take my children.

1494
01:55:52,817 --> 01:55:53,923
I'm begging you.

1495
01:55:54,340 --> 01:55:55,831
Why should I do that?

1496
01:55:56,321 --> 01:55:59,313
Same reason you sent for your family.

1497
01:55:59,585 --> 01:56:03,067
Please just the children, you don't have to take us.

1498
01:56:03,078 --> 01:56:03,954
Please!

1499
01:56:07,301 --> 01:56:09,647
Please. Oh my God.

1500
01:56:13,161 --> 01:56:16,821
Please. I don't know if you can understand what I'm saying.

1501
01:56:17,238 --> 01:56:19,302
As a mother, I'm begging you.

1502
01:56:19,313 --> 01:56:20,689
Please take them.

1503
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:23,108
Please.

1504
01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:29,312
We are all children of the earth.

1505
01:56:30,105 --> 01:56:33,452
My plan will not work for so many, grandma.

1506
01:56:33,587 --> 01:56:36,444
We will take them all.

1507
01:56:53,023 --> 01:56:55,390
Attention. All construction workers.

1508
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:01,428
They're opening the mountain.

1509
01:57:01,782 --> 01:57:04,326
They are leaving without us.

1510
01:57:05,838 --> 01:57:07,767
Get back. What did I tell you!

1511
01:57:07,778 --> 01:57:10,510
They are leaving you behind too.

1512
01:57:11,605 --> 01:57:12,991
Please be patient

1513
01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:21,906
Follow me.

1514
01:57:25,264 --> 01:57:26,578
Follow me.

1515
01:57:34,023 --> 01:57:35,118
We have to hurry!

1516
01:57:35,618 --> 01:57:36,431
They are leaving!

1517
01:57:39,664 --> 01:57:41,624
Initiating security procedures.

1518
01:57:47,422 --> 01:57:49,945
Excuse me. Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?

1519
01:57:49,955 --> 01:57:51,363
He's on the bridge. This way.

1520
01:57:55,711 --> 01:57:56,650
Tenzin wait!

1521
01:57:59,611 --> 01:58:00,414
Grandma, we're almost there.

1522
01:58:00,424 --> 01:58:02,520
Green lights on pressure, Mr. Anton?

1523
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:03,980
Green lights across the board, captain.

1524
01:58:16,711 --> 01:58:17,994
Why do they have anchors?

1525
01:58:18,088 --> 01:58:20,903
Because they're not space ships. They're arcs.

1526
01:58:21,675 --> 01:58:22,509
Let's go.

1527
01:58:35,428 --> 01:58:36,189
Mr president.

1528
01:58:37,482 --> 01:58:38,170
You've got to see this.

1529
01:59:09,598 --> 01:59:13,257
Stop.Stop.Stop.

1530
01:59:19,941 --> 01:59:21,735
Engage the support mechanisms.

1531
01:59:21,766 --> 01:59:23,903
Aye-aye, captain. Engaging supports.

1532
01:59:23,914 --> 01:59:26,906
Just exactly how long are these things expected To hold us in place, Captain?

1533
01:59:26,906 --> 01:59:29,482
They're just meant to withstand the first impact of the waves,

1534
01:59:29,524 --> 01:59:30,514
Mr Anheuser.

1535
01:59:48,053 --> 01:59:51,014
Down there Oleg, you go first.

1536
01:59:56,832 --> 01:59:57,771
Caesar!

1537
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:05,309
Caesar!

1538
02:00:05,622 --> 02:00:06,894
Caesar!

1539
02:00:14,965 --> 02:00:17,499
Caesar! Caesar!

1540
02:00:18,635 --> 02:00:21,617
Good boy. Come to Mommy.

1541
02:00:22,191 --> 02:00:23,088
Caesar!

1542
02:00:24,068 --> 02:00:25,767
Mommy, where's Tamara?

1543
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:29,334
Daddy look!

1544
02:00:33,035 --> 02:00:34,047
Tamara!

1545
02:01:11,125 --> 02:01:12,898
Oh my God, what's happening out there?

1546
02:01:12,908 --> 02:01:18,257
Anheuser convinced the other Heads of state to launch.

1547
02:01:21,876 --> 02:01:22,929
Mr. Anheuser

1548
02:01:25,254 --> 02:01:26,901
We have to stop this madness.

1549
02:01:28,205 --> 02:01:30,071
Make sure the other bridges can see me.

1550
02:01:30,916 --> 02:01:31,688
What do you think you're doing?

1551
02:01:31,698 --> 02:01:33,460
I know exactly what I'm doing. Turn it on

1552
02:01:35,566 --> 02:01:36,213
Ladies and gentleman,

1553
02:01:36,223 --> 02:01:37,704
This is Dr. Adrian Helmsley

1554
02:01:37,714 --> 02:01:40,613
Chief science adviser to the late president Wilson.

1555
02:01:41,145 --> 02:01:43,157
Could you please turn up the volume, Mr Hoffman.

1556
02:01:44,106 --> 02:01:45,222
I know we've all been forced to make

1557
02:01:45,232 --> 02:01:47,995
Difficult decisions to save our human civilization.

1558
02:01:48,392 --> 02:01:51,228
But to be human means to care for each other and

1559
02:01:51,238 --> 02:01:54,982
Civilization means to work together to create a better life.

1560
02:01:55,503 --> 02:01:56,421
If that's true,

1561
02:01:56,431 --> 02:01:58,047
Then there's nothing human and

1562
02:01:58,058 --> 02:02:00,779
Nothing civilized about what we're doing here.

1563
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:03,688
Dr. Helmsley's passion is admirable,

1564
02:02:03,876 --> 02:02:05,044
But I remind you that

1565
02:02:05,054 --> 02:02:08,120
we have very Limited resources and extremely limited time.

1566
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:08,798
Ask yourselves,

1567
02:02:08,808 --> 02:02:11,759
Can we really stand by and watch these people die?

1568
02:02:13,615 --> 02:02:15,460
I read a quote two days ago.

1569
02:02:15,648 --> 02:02:17,525
The author is probably by now.

1570
02:02:17,535 --> 02:02:20,518
But he said that the moment we stop fighting with each other.

1571
02:02:20,518 --> 02:02:23,823
"That's the moment that we lose our humanity"

1572
02:02:24,011 --> 02:02:25,293
And in order to save the human race,

1573
02:02:25,304 --> 02:02:27,931
We have an obligation to stick to this plan

1574
02:02:27,942 --> 02:02:30,986
Which every nation on this flotilla signed up for.

1575
02:02:31,205 --> 02:02:32,905
They're in God's hands now.

1576
02:02:35,512 --> 02:02:37,347
Officer, you turn that off.

1577
02:02:38,984 --> 02:02:40,350
That is an order, sailor. Turn it off!

1578
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:42,206
Don't you dare touch that button, young man!

1579
02:02:42,269 --> 02:02:44,729
Have you completely lost your mind?

1580
02:02:45,324 --> 02:02:46,491
Look at the clock!

1581
02:02:46,637 --> 02:02:48,702
We have barely 15 minutes left!

1582
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:51,528
Do you want to be responsible for the extinction of the human race?

1583
02:02:51,632 --> 02:02:52,967
Can you handle that, Adrian?

1584
02:02:53,822 --> 02:02:55,918
There's a young astrophysicist from India

1585
02:02:55,928 --> 02:02:57,450
who's the reason we are all here.

1586
02:02:57,461 --> 02:02:58,681
Oh, for God's sake.

1587
02:02:59,233 --> 02:03:01,600
He's the one who discovered it all.

1588
02:03:01,611 --> 02:03:02,779
He connected all the dots,

1589
02:03:02,789 --> 02:03:04,791
We all owe him our lives.

1590
02:03:05,521 --> 02:03:07,784
I just learned that he was killed with His family

1591
02:03:07,794 --> 02:03:10,317
in a tsunami in eastern India.

1592
02:03:12,851 --> 02:03:14,175
He was my friend.

1593
02:03:15,437 --> 02:03:16,803
And he died in vain.

1594
02:03:18,127 --> 02:03:21,454
Everybody out there has died in vain.

1595
02:03:21,464 --> 02:03:24,717
If we start our future with an act of cruelty,

1596
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:28,325
What will you tell your children?

1597
02:03:34,842 --> 02:03:36,333
If my father were here,

1598
02:03:36,886 --> 02:03:38,345
He would open the gates

1599
02:03:45,728 --> 02:03:58,136
The people of Russia along withChina and Japan agree to open the gates!

1600
02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:03,151
The United Kingdom, Spain, France

1601
02:04:03,402 --> 02:04:05,060
Canada and Germany,

1602
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:09,157
And I believe I may also speak for the Italy president

1603
02:04:09,564 --> 02:04:11,910
The we vote to let these people come in.

1604
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:22,348
Captain Michaels. Please

1605
02:04:26,936 --> 02:04:27,947
This is your captain.

1606
02:04:28,573 --> 02:04:31,023
In a few moments, we will open the gates.

1607
02:04:39,302 --> 02:04:41,273
Phew, it stinks.

1608
02:05:00,563 --> 02:05:01,950
They are opening the gate.

1609
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:04,202
Come down! Noah. Move it!

1610
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:07,132
Noah! Noah! Noah!

1611
02:05:18,435 --> 02:05:20,030
Mom, something happened.

1612
02:05:20,614 --> 02:05:22,210
Hold on, hold on.

1613
02:05:25,077 --> 02:05:30,447
Hold on, god damn it! Give me your hand!

1614
02:05:30,458 --> 02:05:31,615
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

1615
02:05:31,625 --> 02:05:34,681
Reach for it! Help me!

1616
02:05:37,736 --> 02:05:38,737
Gordon!

1617
02:05:41,771 --> 02:05:42,616
Stop!

1618
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:49,185
Climb!

1619
02:06:23,625 --> 02:06:24,616
What's wrong with the gate?

1620
02:06:25,002 --> 02:06:26,295
Looks like it didn't run the full cycle.

1621
02:06:26,305 --> 02:06:27,369
We're checking it out.

1622
02:06:28,964 --> 02:06:30,038
Order, please!

1623
02:06:37,055 --> 02:06:38,526
4 minutes to impact

1624
02:07:24,978 --> 02:07:27,523
We're all loaded, captain. Then let's lock it up. Now!

1625
02:07:38,106 --> 02:07:40,556
Oleg! Grab my hand!

1626
02:07:41,245 --> 02:07:42,631
Oleg!

1627
02:07:42,663 --> 02:07:44,665
No, no, no

1628
02:07:47,125 --> 02:07:48,992
No!

1629
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,914
Something's jamming the hydraulics, Captain.

1630
02:08:14,924 --> 02:08:16,405
Well then get it out for Christ sake.

1631
02:08:16,415 --> 02:08:19,376
I can't fire up the engines until we get a good seal on that gate.

1632
02:08:19,867 --> 02:08:22,160
Captain, we have a breach in the zoological bay.

1633
02:08:22,265 --> 02:08:23,245
Can you zoom in?

1634
02:08:23,307 --> 02:08:23,964
Yeah!

1635
02:08:28,573 --> 02:08:29,501
I know those kids.

1636
02:08:29,512 --> 02:08:32,035
What is happening? What's going on?

1637
02:08:32,348 --> 02:08:33,484
Where did they come from?

1638
02:08:36,216 --> 02:08:38,072
There. Through the hydraulic chamber.

1639
02:08:38,083 --> 02:08:39,647
Captain, I think we found the problem!

1640
02:08:39,657 --> 02:08:41,492
Who are these people? No, wait!

1641
02:08:42,514 --> 02:08:43,515
He's injured.

1642
02:08:43,692 --> 02:08:44,923
Something must've gone wrong.

1643
02:08:44,933 --> 02:08:46,424
Something must've gone wrong?

1644
02:08:46,935 --> 02:08:50,126
Are you kidding me? Of course something went wrong!

1645
02:08:50,501 --> 02:08:52,170
Congratulations to the both of you.

1646
02:08:52,430 --> 02:08:53,567
Might have gotten us all killed,

1647
02:08:53,577 --> 02:08:56,017
But as long as your conscience is clean, right Helmsley?

1648
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:57,686
Captain, get an emergency team down there

1649
02:08:57,696 --> 02:08:59,416
I'll meet them at the hydraulics chamber.

1650
02:08:59,562 --> 02:09:01,721
You know your way around here? Yeah. Let's go!

1651
02:09:01,731 --> 02:09:03,806
1 minute to impact.

1652
02:09:17,768 --> 02:09:18,540
Captain?

1653
02:09:19,019 --> 02:09:20,521
Cho Ming airfield has been hit.

1654
02:09:21,282 --> 02:09:23,336
Put me on emergency comm, Mr.Taylor.

1655
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:30,958
This is the captain speaking we expect to be impacted by water shortly.

1656
02:09:31,230 --> 02:09:32,137
We need to go this way.

1657
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:56,317
All stations prepare for impact.

1658
02:10:42,853 --> 02:10:45,126
Pressure just climbed 80 Pascal.

1659
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:47,942
Surface compression of valve sensors, Captain.

1660
02:10:47,952 --> 02:10:49,266
Track Dr Helmsley.

1661
02:10:49,766 --> 02:10:50,486
There.

1662
02:10:55,428 --> 02:10:57,409
Out of the way! Excuse me.

1663
02:10:58,869 --> 02:11:01,132
Tenzin. Almost there.

1664
02:11:02,008 --> 02:11:03,415
Nima. What happened?

1665
02:11:05,981 --> 02:11:06,721
Tamara!

1666
02:11:06,992 --> 02:11:09,161
Will you take the kids please?

1667
02:11:09,547 --> 02:11:10,443
Which way?

1668
02:11:10,996 --> 02:11:14,645
We can't get there! Water is entering the stern.

1669
02:11:15,261 --> 02:11:18,941
The rear of this ship is flooded and Will seal up one compartment at a time.

1670
02:11:19,650 --> 02:11:20,599
Where's Gordon?

1671
02:11:22,153 --> 02:11:22,904
No?

1672
02:11:25,177 --> 02:11:26,167
We gotta go back!

1673
02:11:26,856 --> 02:11:28,868
We have to go back!

1674
02:11:32,528 --> 02:11:33,915
Mommy!

1675
02:11:34,248 --> 02:11:36,553
Help! Mommy!

1676
02:11:38,357 --> 02:11:40,108
Run!

1677
02:11:41,495 --> 02:11:42,517
Lilly run!

1678
02:11:45,666 --> 02:11:46,938
Go over, Lilly!

1679
02:11:49,952 --> 02:11:51,985
Caesar! Lilly, take him!

1680
02:11:54,686 --> 02:11:56,239
Mommy!

1681
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:06,061
Is there another way to the hydraulics chamber?

1682
02:12:06,072 --> 02:12:07,021
Where does this ladder go?

1683
02:12:07,031 --> 02:12:10,086
To the zoological pens Okay, let's go!

1684
02:12:16,343 --> 02:12:19,074
Professor? It's Air Force One.

1685
02:12:37,207 --> 02:12:38,531
The mid-ship anchor support is hit.

1686
02:12:38,542 --> 02:12:39,897
Can you stabilize it?

1687
02:12:39,908 --> 02:12:41,514
The bow anchor is giving in.

1688
02:13:01,346 --> 02:13:03,171
Captain, the turbines aren't responding.

1689
02:13:03,181 --> 02:13:06,038
So override it. Hit the override. Start the engine.

1690
02:13:06,049 --> 02:13:08,343
We can't start the engine until we close that gate.

1691
02:13:26,892 --> 02:13:28,905
Help me! Help!

1692
02:13:34,066 --> 02:13:35,411
Momma!

1693
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:37,966
Momma!

1694
02:13:38,623 --> 02:13:41,313
Are you ok? My Mommy is in there. Please help her!

1695
02:13:41,323 --> 02:13:42,366
We'll get to your Mommy, sweetheart.

1696
02:13:42,377 --> 02:13:43,742
They're doing everything they can, okay?

1697
02:13:43,753 --> 02:13:44,921
Can we talk to her?

1698
02:13:45,056 --> 02:13:46,464
I'm gonna try to connect us.

1699
02:13:47,256 --> 02:13:48,706
We have to stop the bleeding!

1700
02:13:48,716 --> 02:13:49,988
How about my belt?

1701
02:13:50,259 --> 02:13:52,856
Here Mom! Mr. Curtis? Jackson?

1702
02:13:53,398 --> 02:13:56,265
Help!

1703
02:13:56,557 --> 02:13:58,726
It's Adrian Helmsley, we met at Yellowstone.

1704
02:13:58,820 --> 02:14:01,343
Thats great. Open the god damn door!

1705
02:14:01,667 --> 02:14:02,824
Your daughter is with me!

1706
02:14:02,949 --> 02:14:06,463
Lilly? Where's Noah?

1707
02:14:06,651 --> 02:14:07,871
I'm right here, Lil!

1708
02:14:08,569 --> 02:14:14,085
Impact warning 30 west. 45 east.

1709
02:14:14,096 --> 02:14:17,850
Target elevation 29035 feet.

1710
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:20,998
29000 feet? What the hell is at 29000 feet?

1711
02:14:21,301 --> 02:14:23,949
We're headed straight for the north face of Mount Everest

1712
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:25,336
Mr. Anheuser.

1713
02:14:25,743 --> 02:14:29,695
And if we can't start our engines, we will not survive the impact.

1714
02:14:40,174 --> 02:14:43,208
Jackson, you're sealed off! We can't get to you!

1715
02:14:43,323 --> 02:14:45,158
There's something blocking the hydraulics

1716
02:14:45,169 --> 02:14:47,546
If you can't get it out, none of us are gonna make it

1717
02:14:49,141 --> 02:14:51,362
Dr. Helmsley, look at this.

1718
02:14:52,113 --> 02:14:53,708
It's completely submerged down there

1719
02:14:53,719 --> 02:14:56,013
And there's no way for them to get any air.

1720
02:14:56,138 --> 02:14:57,108
Theres no other way!

1721
02:14:57,274 --> 02:14:59,120
But it's a suicide mission, Sir!

1722
02:15:06,826 --> 02:15:08,723
I know where it is, I'll give it a try.

1723
02:15:15,897 --> 02:15:18,160
Dad, wait, I wanna go with you!

1724
02:15:18,295 --> 02:15:20,725
Dad, I wanna help you! No, no, no.

1725
02:15:21,225 --> 02:15:23,144
You are helping me. Dad, please!

1726
02:15:23,207 --> 02:15:25,511
Remember when Lilly was born

1727
02:15:25,699 --> 02:15:27,503
And you wanted to be introduced as her big brother?

1728
02:15:28,076 --> 02:15:29,244
Well, she's scared now.

1729
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:30,870
She needs you more than ever.

1730
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:34,384
If you're safe, I know that she's safe. Do you understand?

1731
02:15:41,350 --> 02:15:42,955
You can help me out the next time.

1732
02:15:46,782 --> 02:15:48,284
We caused this thing, it was us.

1733
02:15:48,597 --> 02:15:49,754
I gotta go check it out.

1734
02:16:20,347 --> 02:16:21,922
Can you hear me?

1735
02:16:28,730 --> 02:16:31,056
Who can help me! Help!

1736
02:16:33,673 --> 02:16:35,153
Who can help me!

1737
02:16:54,089 --> 02:16:55,121
Press down!

1738
02:16:55,278 --> 02:16:56,915
Press down with your hand!

1739
02:17:05,215 --> 02:17:07,029
Don't stop. Keep pressing!

1740
02:17:24,588 --> 02:17:25,975
No!

1741
02:17:29,906 --> 02:17:34,296
Distance to impact 1850 meters

1742
02:17:37,090 --> 02:17:38,102
There he is!

1743
02:17:39,655 --> 02:17:41,762
Captain! We have a visual!

1744
02:17:41,772 --> 02:17:43,263
I think we found the problem.

1745
02:17:43,378 --> 02:17:44,786
Show us the hydraulics chamber.

1746
02:18:02,449 --> 02:18:04,608
I told you to stay up there with your Mom!

1747
02:18:04,618 --> 02:18:06,005
I just wanted to help.

1748
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:09,686
Alright. Hold the light.

1749
02:18:09,696 --> 02:18:11,323
We're right under the air pocket, okay?

1750
02:18:12,376 --> 02:18:13,575
How did you know I needed help?

1751
02:18:18,392 --> 02:18:21,520
Grandpa, grandmaI'm sorry.

1752
02:18:22,730 --> 02:18:23,658
I could not save us.

1753
02:18:24,336 --> 02:18:27,245
He has gone back in. He will fix it.

1754
02:18:28,173 --> 02:18:30,248
There's no way.

1755
02:18:31,363 --> 02:18:33,292
Don't lose faith, brother.

1756
02:19:08,807 --> 02:19:09,485
Malfunction

1757
02:19:10,966 --> 02:19:13,082
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

1758
02:19:34,468 --> 02:19:37,336
Great job! You light the way and I'll go for the cable.

1759
02:19:38,608 --> 02:19:41,100
Distance to impact 400 meters

1760
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:42,695
Underwater ridge ahead!

1761
02:19:42,747 --> 02:19:44,228
We're going to run aground, captain!

1762
02:20:14,644 --> 02:20:16,229
Sir, the gate is sealed!

1763
02:20:16,354 --> 02:20:17,532
That's affirmative, captain!

1764
02:20:17,543 --> 02:20:19,169
Anton, start the engines.

1765
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:21,067
Aye-aye captain. Full reverse.

1766
02:20:29,878 --> 02:20:31,546
Captain! We're not gonna make it!

1767
02:20:31,557 --> 02:20:34,215
Distance to impact 50 meters.

1768
02:20:35,081 --> 02:20:36,405
40 meters.

1769
02:20:59,929 --> 02:21:01,962
Reverse motion activated.

1770
02:21:02,285 --> 02:21:07,801
10 meters. 20 meters.

1771
02:21:22,305 --> 02:21:23,139
Hard to port!

1772
02:21:23,150 --> 02:21:24,672
Okay, hard to port!

1773
02:21:35,829 --> 02:21:38,353
We did it! We did it!

1774
02:21:39,072 --> 02:21:41,022
Where's Dad? He was right behind me, Mommy.

1775
02:21:42,815 --> 02:21:44,869
Any word from the hydraulic chamber?

1776
02:21:45,026 --> 02:21:45,839
Where is he?

1777
02:21:46,016 --> 02:21:47,674
I thought you said he was right behind you.

1778
02:21:47,747 --> 02:21:48,519
He was!

1779
02:21:48,613 --> 02:21:50,041
Are you sure? Yes.

1780
02:21:50,333 --> 02:21:51,793
He was right there!

1781
02:22:00,343 --> 02:22:03,680
Dad. Dad!

1782
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:05,724
Come on, Jackson. Come on.

1783
02:22:10,197 --> 02:22:12,533
Please, please.

1784
02:22:14,847 --> 02:22:17,506
Please, please.

1785
02:22:35,065 --> 02:22:36,004
He did it!

1786
02:22:36,838 --> 02:22:37,745
He did it!

1787
02:23:36,637 --> 02:23:38,963
Shuttle Atlantis. Our last day.

1788
02:23:39,849 --> 02:23:42,696
All we can hear is the sound of our own breathing.

1789
02:23:42,873 --> 02:23:46,345
That reminds us we are still sharing our memories

1790
02:23:46,356 --> 02:23:48,034
Hopes and ideas.

1791
02:23:48,848 --> 02:23:51,819
And isn't it funny? Just this morning, we walked out.

1792
02:23:52,508 --> 02:23:56,699
Somehow we all have relatives in Wisconsin.

1793
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:00,641
The end.

1794
02:24:11,141 --> 02:24:12,058
It's good.

1795
02:24:13,403 --> 02:24:14,603
I thought you would like it.

1796
02:24:16,698 --> 02:24:20,807
Tell meApart from books and art.

1797
02:24:22,673 --> 02:24:25,728
Do you think there's anything else we might possibly share?

1798
02:24:26,604 --> 02:24:27,689
In the future?

1799
02:24:29,357 --> 02:24:32,475
Are you asking me out on a date, Dr. Helmsley?

1800
02:24:33,872 --> 02:24:36,030
You know my diary is pretty full.

1801
02:24:37,918 --> 02:24:38,866
Actually

1802
02:24:42,318 --> 02:24:43,371
Yes, I was.

1803
02:24:48,386 --> 02:24:50,274
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge, please.

1804
02:24:51,337 --> 02:24:52,797
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge.

1805
02:24:55,612 --> 02:24:56,363
Come here.

1806
02:25:03,245 --> 02:25:05,601
Ladies and gentleman, this is captain Michaels speaking.

1807
02:25:06,602 --> 02:25:09,887
In a few minutes I will give orders to unseal the decks.

1808
02:25:11,138 --> 02:25:13,109
At 23:45 last night

1809
02:25:13,119 --> 02:25:17,436
Our sister arks number 6 and 7 have joined our course.

1810
02:25:18,875 --> 02:25:23,369
For the first time on our journey, we will have clear skies.

1811
02:25:24,078 --> 02:25:27,269
As you know our passenger count is way over capacity.

1812
02:25:27,415 --> 02:25:31,106
So please, be careful when you step out and of course

1813
02:25:31,554 --> 02:25:33,181
Enjoy the fresh air.

1814
02:25:36,226 --> 02:25:37,102
Can I hold him?

1815
02:25:37,696 --> 02:25:40,376
Sure, he can be your dog too if you like.

1816
02:25:40,470 --> 02:25:41,147
Thanks.

1817
02:25:45,819 --> 02:25:47,018
Where have you been all my life?

1818
02:25:47,425 --> 02:25:48,217
Gift shop.

1819
02:26:46,119 --> 02:26:48,684
Oh, Adrian. Excellent.

1820
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:51,092
I called because we just got our first satellite feet.

1821
02:26:51,103 --> 02:26:53,021
The equalization of the oceanic

1822
02:26:53,219 --> 02:26:57,005
Seabeds has not turned out to be as extreme as we expected.

1823
02:26:57,015 --> 02:26:58,423
The waters are receding.

1824
02:26:58,454 --> 02:26:59,882
Much faster than we thought.

1825
02:26:59,924 --> 02:27:01,405
Thank God. And

1826
02:27:02,041 --> 02:27:02,917
This is hard to believe,

1827
02:27:02,927 --> 02:27:05,795
But the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world.

1828
02:27:06,034 --> 02:27:09,517
It's now the Drakensberg Mountains of Kwazulu, Nepal.

1829
02:27:09,527 --> 02:27:11,665
The entire African continent has just risen.

1830
02:27:11,675 --> 02:27:14,814
7000 feet, and unlikely they are even flooded.

1831
02:27:14,866 --> 02:27:16,899
That's why they call it the Cape of Good Hope.

1832
02:27:16,910 --> 02:27:18,609
We've already set course for it.

1833
02:27:26,503 --> 02:27:28,536
Daddy, when will we go back home?

1834
02:27:29,318 --> 02:27:30,621
Well, we talked about that.

1835
02:27:30,632 --> 02:27:32,780
We're gonna find a new home out here somewhere.

1836
02:27:33,896 --> 02:27:36,471
Right? Wherever we're all together. That's home.

1837
02:27:37,514 --> 02:27:38,087
Right?

1838
02:27:39,099 --> 02:27:39,954
You are scared?

1839
02:27:40,141 --> 02:27:40,861
I am not.

1840
02:27:43,353 --> 02:27:44,813
No more pull-ups.

1841
02:27:48,181 --> 02:27:48,984
Nice.
