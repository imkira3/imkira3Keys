Opening & Ending
Encyciopedia"

00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,875
"The Spirit Realm"

3
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,967
Ah, so busy, so busy, so busy...

4
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,302
It's Botan! I'm coming in.

5
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,672
--So busy, so busy...
--Koenma-sama, I'm just going to pop
on down to the Human Reaim, okay?

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,207
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

7
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,076
Okay!

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,477
Hey, just a minute!

9
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,045
Is that all the screen time I get?

10
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,265
And after showing up again
after all this time, too!

11
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:05,308
In a crowded city, as I
bump shoulders, I'm all alone

12
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:11,915
On an endless prairie, as the
wind whistles by, I'm all alone

13
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:19,422
Which one is it that makes me
want to cry more, I wonder

14
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:26,716
Marking it with twin circles,
I feel a bit more grown-up!

15
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,467
It must be, that when I run
into these terribly difficult walls,

16
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:35,138
and unexpectedly, for whatever reason,

17
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:42,712
the courage and power to break
through rises up from within

18
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:49,953
All because of how, when I run
into these terribly difficult people,

19
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:57,560
they show me kindness, I bet!

20
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,885
Thank you very much!

21
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,829
Look out!

22
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,748
Urameshi Yusuke, age 14, hyper-delinquent.

23
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:23,419
He dies in place of a child who is a complete
stranger to him, in a traffic accident.

24
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,289
Back then, who would have ever predicted

25
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,225
the strange destiny he would have?

26
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:33,663
To put it in a nutshell, Urameshi Yusuke is...

27
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,432
...a simpleton who doesn't
think before he acts!

28
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,569
A fool whose body engages
before his brain does!

29
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,339
Minamino Shuichi, whose true
identity is the Yoko Kurama.

30
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,208
He can turn any plant into a weapon,

31
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:49,278
and becomes mercilessly hard-nosed
against anyone who means him harm.

32
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,980
While living in the Human Realm,

33
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,849
he develops feelings of affection
toward his adopted mother,

34
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,952
and his encounter with Yusuke
and company changes him.

35
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,389
Hiei, the Jagan Master with
a third eye in his forehead.

36
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,525
Born in a land of ice,
he uses flame techniques.

37
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,261
The heart of this callous, ambivalent fellow

38
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,231
also changes through his battles.

39
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,367
Kuwabara Kazuma. Eh, never mind about him.

40
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,369
Hey, what was that?!

41
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:17,240
As the cherry blossom among flowers,
so is Kuwabara's grit among men!

42
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:21,210
He fights for love, justice, and Yukina-san!

43
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,945
Hobbies include looking after cats,

44
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,448
and his motto is to do a good deed daily!

45
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,316
In any event...

46
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,605
...I sure am glad to have met them.

47
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:44,256
The second hand is sharp again tonight

48
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,973
As it chops up time

49
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,829
"Chi chi chi..."

50
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,701
I'll never be able to finish this homework

51
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:05,722
So I toss it away!

52
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,738
Son of a gun!

53
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:17,533
It's the dreams that tumble away, oh

54
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:24,373
That are the ones I want to go after

55
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:32,115
And if l stop, they will get away, oh

56
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:38,955
So I can't ease up on them!

57
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:45,942
It's the dreams that tumble away, oh...!

58
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,245
¥300.

59
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,213
Thank you!

60
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,249
Step on up!

61
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,750
Oh, it's you, Keiko.

62
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,953
What do you mean, "Oh, it's you"?
You're talking to a customer.

63
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,088
Char siu pork and noodles.

64
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,023
Coming right up.

65
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,325
It looks like you're making
an honest living, huh?

66
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,527
Thankfully, yes.

67
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,562
Very good, very good.

68
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,111
Your order's ready.

69
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,456
How is it, miss?

70
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,171
I hate to admit it, but it's good.

71
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:31,240
Isn't it? I'm not telling you
what the secret ingredient is.

72
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,742
Come to think of it, Yusuke,

73
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,645
this is the first I've ever had of your cooking.

74
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,934
If you like this sort of thing,
I'll make it for you every day.

75
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,320
Hey, your face is flushed. Are you all right?

76
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,903
It's nothing!

77
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,160
By the way, are you free tomorrow?

78
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,930
Why? What if I am free tomorrow?

79
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,766
Oh, Botan was by earlier.
She said it's been too long,

80
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,122
and we should all get
together at Ba-san's piace.

81
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,273
Hey, your face really is red.
You sure you don't have a cold?

82
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,474
It's nothing at all!

83
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,776
Hey, are you okay?

84
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,945
I said I'm fine!

85
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,913
This is incredibly delicious.

86
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,116
Urameshi, you've upped your game.

87
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,785
I'm not treating you today.

88
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:19,322
Who'd have thought you
had this kind of talent?

89
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,723
Isn't that the truth?

90
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,260
He'll be able to take over the
Yukimura Diner any time like this.

91
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,529
W-Why would you say something like that?!

92
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,597
Hey, Keiko...

93
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,099
Yeah, I know, my face is red!

94
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,784
Do you have a cold?

95
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:45,381
As my heart is about to burst,

96
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:52,388
the mild wind that blows
against us is gentle

97
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,727
Facing each other, hand in hand,

98
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:04,734
the usual twilight
envelops us and melts away

99
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:10,740
Isn't it funny? They're not
even the slightest bit alike,

100
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:17,079
your smiling face, and mine

101
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:23,753
But right now, it feels like
I'm looking in a mirror

102
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:30,092
I am not feeling sad;
everything is fine, after all

103
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:36,432
There, hiding within an offhanded
greeting, lies a "thank you"

104
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:42,772
Sayonara, bye bye,
take care of yourself

105
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,274
This is the line I'm drawing between us,

106
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,178
so catch it, if you would

107
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:55,418
Sayonara, bye bye,
take care of yourself

108
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,920
This is the line I'm drawing between us,

109
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,822
so catch it, if you would

110
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,791
so catch it, if you would
Granny is as chipper as ever, huh?

111
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,192
Sayonara, bye bye,
take care of yourself
Granny is as chipper as ever, huh?

112
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,694
Sayonara, bye bye,
take care of yourself
Yeah.

113
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,562
Sayonara, bye bye,
take care of yourself 
It's been just about a year
since the Spirit Reaim

114
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,730
Sayonara, bye bye,
take care of yourself
brought down the kekkai barrier.

115
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:08,464
brought down the kekkai barrier.

116
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,168
It looks like they're slowly
warming up to each other--

117
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,403
both the Spirit Realm and the Demon Realm.

118
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,673
No matter how sunny their coexistence
may be promoted as being,

119
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,076
some friction is bound to come up.

120
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,944
They may be undeservedly
discriminated against,

121
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,746
just for being Yokai.

122
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,882
When that happens, someone
will have to stick up for them.

123
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,684
Leave that to me!

124
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,053
Kuwabara the man will defend Yukina-san,

125
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,222
even at the cost of his own iife!

126
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:37,093
Please rest assured, I will
take care of you, Yukina-san!

127
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,794
Right! Thank you.

128
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:42,531
Oh, come on, now. I mean, this is me, right?

129
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,956
Hey, Yusuke!

130
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,107
Huh? Where's Yukina-chan?

131
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,476
She's still talking to Ba-chan.

132
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,277
Huh? That photo!

133
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,413
That's the one I dropped earlier, isn't it?

134
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,415
It is?

135
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:03,419
Ta-da! Look! I brought all the
pictures we've taken together.

136
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,856
Most of them are from the Dark Tournament.

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,827
The Dark Tournament, huh?
That seems like it was so long ago now.

138
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,063
There were all sorts of folks there, huh?

139
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,266
And Kuwa-chan had a real strong showing, too.

140
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,402
Oh, please! Do go on.

141
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,871
I wonder how Chu, Jin
and the others are doing.

142
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:26,342
It looks like they're all fired up,
ready for the next tournament.

143
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,597
I can't wait to fight against them again!

144
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,922
Within a cracked mirror

145
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,259
I see your reflection

146
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:47,263
Crying, crying

147
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:51,934
As you trace the narrow
moon with your finger

148
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,938
Who is it that I am calling out to?

149
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,275
It's the back of a love
nowhere to be found

150
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,612
Over and over, over and over

151
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,949
I will tap at your window

152
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:14,957
With my back pressed by
the acceleration of night

153
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,961
It was as if a thread was snapping

154
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:26,985
And I just held on to you,
held on to you, tightly

155
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:31,307
As you exchange your
unbalanced kisses with me,

156
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:35,244
come closer to my love!

157
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:39,248
May both your tears and
your sorrowful deceptions

158
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:46,770
come to rest in my heart!

159
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,038
Hiei-kun didn't come, huh?

160
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,407
I tried to contact him through Enki,

161
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,110
but he said he's not with Mukuro right now.

162
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,546
That's just the kind of guy he is.

163
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,016
I mean, really, he has
no sense of cooperation.

164
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,886
I'm sure he must be doing
some secret training

165
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,277
to get ready for the upcoming
Demon Realm Unification Tournament.

166
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,390
Here it is!

167
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:26,362
Hiei, fast asleep after fighting
Sensui in the Demon Realm!

168
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,731
Yusuke...

169
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,634
Oh, I was just thinking,

170
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,403
if I'd met Toguro and Sensui in
the Demon Realm to begin with,

171
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,740
maybe our fights might have taken...

172
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,199
...some other form.

173
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:10,673
In a crowded city, as I
bump shoulders, I'm all alone

174
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:17,279
On an endless prairie, as the
wind whistles by, I'm all alone

175
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:24,787
Which one is it that makes me
want to cry more, I wonder

176
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:32,081
Marking it with twin circles,
I feel a bit more grown-up!

177
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,832
It must be, that when I run
into these terribly difficult walls,

178
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,502
and unexpectedly, for whatever reason,

179
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:48,077
the courage and power to break
through rises up from within

180
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:55,317
All because of how, when I run
into these terribly difficult people,

181
00:12:55,341 --> 00:13:02,925
they show me kindness, I bet!

182
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:07,250
Thank you very much!

183
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,078
Hiei-san...

184
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,582
I couldn't find your brother.

185
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,597
He is probably already dead.

186
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,254
You can have this back.

187
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,610
No, that's okay.

188
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,563
You please hang on to it.

189
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:46,423
I have a feeling that it would
be better for you to keep it.

190
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:57,102
Yukina is not as much of
a child as you think she is.

191
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:07,323
When my letter reaches you,
don't break the seal

192
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:15,164
Just leave it alone,
and after some time has passed,

193
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:20,502
I'm sure you will
understand how I feel now

194
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:26,021
This is my first, and last, request

195
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:34,183
As gently as we could, it wasn't very hard

196
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:41,857
With one purpose, we foolishly embraced

197
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:47,196
As twilight closes in,
I shoot an arrow of courage

198
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:54,559
from a distant window,
toward your back, as you leave

199
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:03,212
Although it still has not
stopped raining outside,

200
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:09,718
the drenched people and the city
still believe in the sun

201
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:16,392
An old melody, and a blurred silhouette

202
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:24,119
Living the easy life doesn't
make for a very good picture

203
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,786
Ah, here she comes.

204
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,574
I'm sorry to keep you all waiting.

205
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,344
Oh, no, not at all.

206
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:38,313
For you, Yukina-san,
I would wait a hundred years.

207
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,681
I'm so sorry.

208
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,850
Well then, there's still plenty of day left.

209
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,419
Want to stop off somewhere on the way back?

210
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,355
You mean like that beach of memories?

211
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,590
Huh? Memories?

212
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,060
Yes, the beach of memories.

213
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:56,899
Oh, right! That's what you meant!
The beach of memories!

214
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,400
What are you talking about?

215
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,336
Heh, don't play dumb.

216
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,471
Yusuke, you...

217
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,839
...and Keiko-chan's...

218
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,208
...first kiss seaside beach!

219
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,944
Y-You dumbasses! That was just, you know...

220
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,113
Don't start blushing about it now!

221
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,549
--No, actually, it was our second.
--Yusuke!

222
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,118
The late summer heat today
is something else, huh?

223
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,754
Sis, you tell 'em, you tell 'em!

224
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:19,988
Come on, let's go.

226
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,567
Behind closed eyes, only longing arises

227
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:35,237
as to the sleeping season I bid good-bye

228
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:39,074
More than kindness that
sparkles in the distance,

229
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:43,245
I'd rather have just one thing that I want

230
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:50,586
Having passed through a city of cold glass,

231
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:58,610
I want to touch your hands,
and confirm your feelings

232
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,998
It's just a dream I'm
having with my eyes open,

233
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,002
for me to be hugging you so tightly

234
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:13,842
Although the wind may blow, the rain
may fall, and my heart may waver,

235
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,180
if it's a dream I'm
having with my eyes open,

236
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,450
it's okay if now I get hurt

237
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:29,258
I can be as gentle as
the sky is unpredictable

238
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,995
I've come to realize that
all of us are by ourselves,

239
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:36,732
somewhat accustomed to emptiness, lonely

240
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,469
In the gloom of my midafternoon room,

241
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:44,673
I lift up my dejected face

242
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:52,147
Let's break off the unproductive discussions,

243
00:17:52,171 --> 00:18:00,171
and toss out ideas against a bitter future

244
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:04,393
The dream I'm having with my eyes open

245
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,430
is bound to have plenty of thorns

246
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:15,237
The tears of trusting others and
discovering their lies are painful

247
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,274
The dream I'm having with my eyes open

248
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,811
is always jerking me around

249
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:30,504
For as arbitrary as this city is,
I can't leave it behind

250
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:56,578
The dream I'm having with my eyes open

251
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:00,415
is sure to be a challenge

252
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:07,456
The shadow of someone who
snuck in a kick to the heart

253
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,393
If it's a dream I'm
having with my eyes open,

254
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,930
then I don't mind the heartache now

255
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:20,435
As capricious as this love is,
I'll use it as a springboard

256
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,439
It's just a dream I'm
having with my eyes open,

257
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,343
for me to be hugging you so tightly

258
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:28,777
Although the wind may blow, the rain
may fall, and my heart may waver,

259
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,813
Although the wind may blow, the rain
may fall, and my heart may waver,
It's nice that we could all come here again.

260
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,182
Although the wind may blow, the rain
may fall, and my heart may waver,
Mm-hmm, it sure is.

261
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,217
Although the wind may blow, the rain
may fall, and my heart may waver,

262
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:35,417
Although the wind may blow, the rain
may fall, and my heart may waver,
The sea is so pretty, almost like a dream.

263
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:39,354
If it's a dream I'm
having with my eyes open,
The sea is so pretty, almost like a dream.

264
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,824
It's okay if now I get hurt
For me, it's an even bigger
dream to have you here.

265
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,526
I can be as gentle as
the sky is unpredictable
For me, it's an even bigger
dream to have you here.

266
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,096
I can be as gentle as
the sky is unpredictable
It looks like you still
haven't gotten any smarter.

267
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,432
I can be as gentle as
the sky is unpredictable
Hiei! When did you get here?!

268
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:50,832
Hiei! When did you get here?!

269
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,935
Hmph, I can do what I want.

270
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,905
I thought you were supposed to
be at Mukuro's, mellowing out.

271
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,274
What are you talking about?

272
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,009
A little lover's spat, huh?

273
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,310
I'm gonna kill you.

274
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,881
It's been a long time since I've
heard Kuwa-chan and Hiei's repartee.

275
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:09,718
Repartee?! Wait, who's the straight man,
and who's the funny man?

276
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,837
You've gotta make that clear, Botan!

277
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:21,563
It's finally upon us! The Second
Demon Realm Unification Tournament!

278
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,132
Who will come away the winner this time?

279
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:28,670
Will Contestant Urameshi fight
back and vindicate his honor?

280
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:32,908
Hindsight is 20/20. You should go
home now, while you're still alive.

281
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:36,778
Hmph, even if my mortal frame
falls before the whirlwind...

282
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,215
...I will trust in the immortality
of the soul, and move forward.

283
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,784
That is the way a man lives!

284
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,853
And now, the start of
the preliminary matches!

285
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,539
All right! Here we go!
