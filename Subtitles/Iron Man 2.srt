00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,602
<i>Been a while since I was up here</i>
<i>in front of you.</i>

3
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:14,772
<i>Maybe I'll do us all a favour</i>
<i>and just stick to the cards.</i>

4
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,528
<i>There's been speculation that I was</i>
<i>involved in the events that occurred</i>

5
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,030
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop...</i>

6
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,158
<i>Sorry, Mr Stark, do you</i>
<i>honestly expect us to believe that</i>

7
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:28,828
<i>that was a bodyguard</i>
<i>in a suit that conveniently appeared,</i>

8
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:31,622
<i>despite the fact</i>
<i>that you sorely despise bodyguards?</i>

9
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:32,832
<i>Yes.</i>

10
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:37,587
<i>And this mysterious bodyguard</i>
<i>was somehow equipped</i>

11
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:41,090
<i>with an undisclosed</i>
<i>Stark high-tech powered battle...</i>

12
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:43,134
<i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

13
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,763
<i>It is one thing to question the official</i>
<i>story, and another thing entirely</i>

14
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:50,058
<i>to make wild accusations,</i>
<i>or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

15
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:56,356
<i>I mean, let's face it,</i>
<i>I'm not the heroic type.</i>

16
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:58,650
<i>A laundry list of character defects,</i>

17
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,569
<i>all the mistakes I've made,</i>
<i>largely public.</i>

18
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,279
<i>The truth is</i>

19
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:10,203
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

20
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,173
Ivan.

21
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:28,846
Vanya.

22
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:08,149
<i>270 at 30 knots.</i>
<i>Holding steady at 15,000 feet.</i>

23
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,569
<i>You are clear for exfiltration</i>
<i>over the drop zone.</i>

24
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:10,063
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

25
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,482
It's good to be back.

26
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,152
- You missed me?
- Blow something up!

27
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:20,406
I missed you, too.
Blow something up? I already did that.

28
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:23,743
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying

29
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:27,997
its longest period of uninterrupted peace
in years because of me.

30
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,714
I'm not saying
that from the ashes of captivity,

31
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:41,844
never has a greater phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

32
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:50,853
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

33
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:52,563
sipping on an iced tea

34
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,692
because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough

35
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,653
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.

36
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:04,283
I love you, Tony!

37
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:06,494
Please, it's not about me.

38
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:09,664
It's not about you.

39
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,919
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.

40
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,756
It's about what we choose
to leave behind for future generations.

41
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:22,969
And that's why for the next year
and for the first time since 1974,

42
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:25,471
the best and brightest men and women

43
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:27,515
of nations and corporations
the world over

44
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,102
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

45
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:34,230
to leave behind a brighter future.

46
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:36,065
It's not about us.

47
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:40,111
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything,

48
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:42,739
is welcome back to the Stark Expo.

49
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:49,162
And now,
making a special guest appearance

50
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,664
from the great beyond
to tell you what it's all about,

51
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:54,250
please welcome my father, Howard.

52
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,547
<i>Everything is achievable</i>
<i>through technology.</i>

53
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,924
<i>Better living, robust health,</i>

54
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:06,971
<i>and for the first time in human history,</i>
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

55
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:08,973
<i>So, from all of us here</i>
<i>at Stark Industries,</i>

56
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:13,853
<i>I would like to personally introduce you</i>
<i>to the City of the Future.</i>

57
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:17,690
<i>Technology holds infinite possibilities</i>
<i>for mankind,</i>

58
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,610
<i>and will one day rid society of all its ills.</i>

59
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:24,280
<i>Soon, technology will affect the way</i>
<i>you live your life every day.</i>

60
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:25,948
<i>No more tedious work,</i>

61
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:30,662
<i>leaving more time for leisure activities</i>
<i>and enjoying the sweet life.</i>

62
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:33,498
<i>The Stark Expo. Welcome.</i>

63
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,589
<i>We are coming to you live</i>
<i>from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,</i>

64
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,550
<i>where Tony Stark</i>
<i>has just walked offstage.</i>

65
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:46,219
<i>Don't worry</i>
<i>if you can't make it down here tonight</i>

66
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:48,721
<i>because this Expo goes on</i>
<i>all year long.</i>

67
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:50,807
<i>And I'm gonna be here</i>
<i>checking out all the attractions</i>

68
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:54,435
<i>and the pavilions and the inventions</i>
<i>from all around the world.</i>

69
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,980
- <i>Make sure you join me...</i>
- All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.

70
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:59,899
- Open up, let's go.
- Hey! Nice to see you.

71
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,527
- All right. Thank you. I remember you.
- Tony, Tony...

72
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,153
Hey, hey...

73
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:06,698
- Call me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

74
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,242
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

75
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,827
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.

76
00:10:10,952 --> 00:10:11,995
This is Larry.

77
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,163
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

78
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,748
- Nice to see you.
- Call me. Call me.

79
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,625
- Larry King.
- Larry!

80
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:20,461
Yes, my people, my people.

81
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,088
Come on, Tony. There we go.

82
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,048
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

83
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,425
No, it was perfect.

84
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,010
Look what we got here, the new model.

85
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:28,803
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

86
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:29,971
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,222
- And you are?
- Marshal.

88
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:33,266
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

89
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,518
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

90
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:36,811
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

91
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,605
- Looking for you.
- Yeah? You found me.

92
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,193
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

93
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:47,822
He doesn't like to be handed things.

94
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,490
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

95
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,700
You are hereby ordered

96
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:53,036
to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

97
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,787
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

98
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:56,456
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

99
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,833
He likes the badge.

100
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,960
- You still like it?
- Yep.

101
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:06,507
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.? 250 miles.

102
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:15,141
<i>Mr Stark, could we pick up now</i>
<i>where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.</i>

103
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:16,809
- <i>Yes, dear?</i>
- <i>Can I have your attention?</i>

104
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:17,977
<i>Absolutely.</i>

105
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:21,022
<i>Do you or do you not possess</i>
<i>a specialised weapon?</i>

106
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,399
- <i>I do not. I do not.</i>
- <i>You do not?</i>

107
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,985
<i>Well, it depends</i>
<i>on how you define the word "weapon."</i>

108
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,738
- <i>The Iron Man weapon.</i>
- <i>My device does not fit that description.</i>

109
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,531
<i>Well... How would you describe it?</i>

110
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,660
<i>I would describe it by defining it</i>
<i>as what it is, Senator.</i>

111
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:37,538
- <i>As?</i>
- <i>It's a high-tech prosthesis.</i>

112
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,665
<i>That is... That is...</i>

113
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,042
<i>That's actually the most apt description</i>
<i>I can make of it.</i>

114
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,002
<i>It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr Stark.</i>

115
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:46,172
<i>Please, if your priority was actually</i>
<i>the well-being of the American citizen...</i>

116
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:49,133
<i>My priority is to get the Iron Man</i>
<i>weapon turned over to the people</i>

117
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,595
- <i>of the United States of America.</i>
- <i>Well, you can forget it.</i>

118
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,933
<i>I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.</i>

119
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,477
<i>To turn over the Iron Man suit</i>
<i>would be to turn over myself,</i>

120
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:02,563
<i>which is tantamount</i>
<i>to indentured servitude or prostitution,</i>

121
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,315
<i>depending on what state you're in.</i>

122
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,360
- <i>You can't have it.</i>
- <i>Look, I'm no expert...</i>

123
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:11,239
<i>In prostitution? Of course not.</i>
<i>You're a senator. Come on.</i>

124
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,659
<i>I'm no expert in weapons.</i>

125
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,536
<i>We have somebody here</i>
<i>who is an expert on weapons.</i>

126
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:21,416
<i>I'd now like to call Justin Hammer,</i>
<i>our current primary weapons contractor.</i>

127
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,920
<i>Let the record reflect that I observed</i>
<i>Mr Hammer entering the chamber,</i>

128
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,338
<i>and I am wondering</i>

129
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:31,175
<i>if and when any actual expert</i>
<i>will also be in attendance.</i>

130
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:39,434
<i>Absolutely. I'm no expert.</i>
<i>I defer to you, Anthony.</i>

131
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,519
<i>You're the wonder boy.</i>

132
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:43,730
<i>Senator, if I may.</i>

133
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:48,276
<i>I may well not be an expert,</i>
<i>but you know who was the expert?</i>

134
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,987
<i>Your dad. Howard Stark.</i>

135
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:55,491
<i>Really a father to us all,</i>
<i>and to the military-industrial age.</i>

136
00:12:56,117 --> 00:13:00,621
<i>Let's just be clear.</i>
<i>He was no flower child. He was a lion.</i>

137
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:03,124
<i>We all know why we're here.</i>
<i>In the last six months,</i>

138
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,337
<i>Anthony Stark has created a sword</i>
<i>with untold possibilities.</i>

139
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:10,256
<i>And yet he insists it's a shield.</i>

140
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:14,969
<i>He asks us to trust him</i>
<i>as we cower behind it.</i>

141
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,306
<i>I wish I were comforted, Anthony,</i>
<i>I really do.</i>

142
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,517
<i>I'd love to leave my door unlocked</i>
<i>when I leave the house,</i>

143
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,061
<i>but this ain't Canada.</i>

144
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:24,812
<i>You know, we live in a world</i>
<i>of grave threats,</i>

145
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,650
<i>threats that Mr Stark</i>
<i>will not always be able to foresee.</i>

146
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,152
<i>Thank you.</i>

147
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,988
<i>God bless Iron Man. God bless America.</i>

148
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,200
<i>That is well said, Mr Hammer.</i>

149
00:13:37,325 --> 00:13:39,243
<i>The committee would now like to invite</i>

150
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:42,455
<i>Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes</i>
<i>to the chamber.</i>

151
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,040
<i>Rhodey? What?</i>

152
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:53,633
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.

153
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:56,344
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

154
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,512
I just...

155
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,013
- Drop it.
- All right, I'll drop it.

156
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,600
<i>I have before me a complete report</i>
<i>on the Iron Man weapon,</i>

157
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:05,353
<i>compiled by Colonel Rhodes.</i>
<i>And, Colonel, for the record,</i>

158
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,564
<i>can you please read page 57,</i>
<i>paragraph four?</i>

159
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,942
<i>You're requesting</i>
<i>that I read specific selections</i>

160
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,318
- <i>from my report, Senator?</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

161
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:14,320
<i>It was my understanding</i>
<i>that I was going to be testifying</i>

162
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:16,572
<i>in a much more comprehensive</i>
<i>and detailed manner.</i>

163
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:18,282
<i>I understand.</i>
<i>A lot of things have changed today.</i>

164
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:19,659
- <i>So if you could just read...</i>
- <i>You do understand</i>

165
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:22,161
<i>that reading a single paragraph</i>
<i>out of context does not reflect</i>

166
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:25,498
- <i>the summary of my final...</i>
- <i>Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.</i>

167
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:27,959
<i>Very well.</i>

168
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:33,214
<i>"As he does not operate within</i>
<i>any definable branch of government,</i>

169
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:39,304
<i>"Iron Man presents a potential threat</i>
<i>to the security of both the nation</i>

170
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:40,805
<i>"and to her interests."</i>

171
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,765
<i>I did, however, go on to summarise</i>

172
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,560
<i>that the benefits of Iron Man</i>
<i>far outweigh the liabilities.</i>

173
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,812
- <i>And that it would be in our interest...</i>
- <i>That's enough, Colonel.</i>

174
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,063
- <i>... to fold Mr Stark...</i>
- <i>That's enough.</i>

175
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,690
<i>... into the existing</i>
<i>chain of command, Senator.</i>

176
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:54,152
<i>I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider</i>
<i>Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.</i>

177
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:56,863
<i>We can amend the hours a little bit.</i>

178
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,324
<i>I'd like to go on and show, if I may,</i>

179
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:01,576
<i>the imagery</i>
<i>that's connected to your report.</i>

180
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,537
<i>I believe it is somewhat premature</i>
<i>to reveal these images</i>

181
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:06,414
- <i>to the general public at this time.</i>
- <i>With all due respect,</i>

182
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,707
<i>Colonel, I understand.</i>

183
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:11,878
<i>And if you could just narrate those</i>
<i>for us, we'd be very grateful.</i>

184
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:13,880
Let's have the images.

185
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,593
<i>Intelligence suggests</i>
<i>that the devices seen in these photos</i>

186
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,554
<i>are, in fact, attempts</i>
<i>at making manned copies</i>

187
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,097
<i>of Mr Stark's suit.</i>

188
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:28,227
<i>This has been corroborated by our allies</i>
<i>and local intelligence on the ground,</i>

189
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:33,441
<i>indicating that these suits are quite</i>
<i>possibly, at this moment, operational.</i>

190
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,528
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

191
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:41,074
Boy, I'm good.
I commandeered your screens.

192
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:44,619
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

193
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,621
- <i>Now, let's see what's really going on.</i>
- <i>What is he doing?</i>

194
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,957
<i>If you will direct your attention</i>
<i>to said screens...</i>

195
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,626
<i>I believe that's North Korea.</i>

196
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:02,720
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

197
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:03,972
Iran.

198
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:11,479
No grave immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?

199
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,023
How did Hammer get in the game?

200
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:16,734
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

201
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:21,280
<i>Okay, give me a left twist.</i>
<i>Left's good. Turn to the right.</i>

202
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:26,452
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, shit!</i>

203
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:27,704
Wow.

204
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:32,458
Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, 10 years away.

205
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,835
Hammer Industries, 20.

206
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,546
<i>I'd like to point out</i>
<i>that that test pilot survived.</i>

207
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,172
<i>I think we're done,</i>
<i>is the point that he's making.</i>

208
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:41,467
- <i>I don't think there's any reason...</i>
- <i>The point is, you're welcome, I guess.</i>

209
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,387
- <i>For what?</i>
- <i>Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.</i>

210
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:47,015
<i>It's working.</i>
<i>We're safe. America is secure.</i>

211
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,017
<i>You want my property?</i>
<i>You can't have it.</i>

212
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,476
<i>But I did you a big favour.</i>

213
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,147
I've successfully privatised world peace.

214
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:59,569
What more do you want? For now!

215
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,239
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

216
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:06,701
<i>... you, Mr Stark... you, buddy.</i>

217
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,911
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.

218
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:11,289
- Okay.
- You've been a delight.

219
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,380
<i>My bond is with the people.</i>

220
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:24,677
<i>And I will serve this great nation</i>
<i>at the pleasure of myself.</i>

221
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,387
<i>If there's one thing I've proven</i>

222
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,807
<i>it's that you can count on me</i>
<i>to pleasure myself.</i>

223
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,011
Wake up. Daddy's home.

224
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:08,680
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

225
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:10,640
<i>Congratulations on</i>
<i>the opening ceremonies.</i>

226
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,768
<i>They were such a success,</i>
<i>as was your Senate hearing.</i>

227
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,603
<i>And may I say how refreshing it is</i>

228
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:19,440
<i>to finally see you in a video</i>
<i>with your clothing on, sir.</i>

229
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,485
You!

230
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:25,279
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

231
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,949
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

232
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,702
How many ounces a day
of this gobbledegook

233
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:31,869
am I supposed to drink?

234
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:35,915
<i>We are up to 80 ounces a day</i>
<i>to counteract the symptoms, sir.</i>

235
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,876
Check palladium levels.

236
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:43,131
<i>Blood toxicity, 24%.</i>

237
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:46,968
<i>It appears that the continued use</i>
<i>of the Iron Man suit</i>

238
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,429
<i>is accelerating your condition.</i>

239
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:53,349
<i>Another core has been depleted.</i>

240
00:18:56,811 --> 00:18:58,396
God, they're running out quick.

241
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:01,149
<i>I have run simulations</i>
<i>on every known element,</i>

242
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,276
<i>and none can serve</i>
<i>as a viable replacement</i>

243
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:05,361
<i>for the palladium core.</i>

244
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,658
<i>You are running out of both time</i>
<i>and options.</i>

245
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:17,081
<i>Unfortunately, the device</i>
<i>that's keeping you alive</i>

246
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:19,000
<i>is also killing you.</i>

247
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:21,919
<i>Miss Potts is approaching.</i>

248
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:24,922
- <i>I recommend that you inform her...</i>
- Mute.

249
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:29,594
Is this a joke?

250
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:32,680
- What are you thinking?
- What?

251
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,058
- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

252
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:37,477
And you're angry about something.

253
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:38,936
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

254
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,438
- Did you just donate...
- Keep your business.

255
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:44,067
...our entire modern art collection
to the...

256
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:45,777
- Boy Scouts of America.
...Boy Scouts of America?

257
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:47,654
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.

258
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,115
I didn't physically check the crates
but, basically, yes.

259
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,368
And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No offence.

260
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,495
No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled

261
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,163
to say "our" collection

262
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:00,458
considering the time that I put in,
over 10 years,

263
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,377
- curating that.
- It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

264
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:05,546
You know,
there's only about 8,011 things

265
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,590
that I really need to talk to you about.

266
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,133
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

267
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,677
The Bridgeport's
already machining that part.

268
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:13,137
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

269
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,473
I need you to wear a surgical mask
until you're feeling better.

270
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:16,599
- Is that okay?
- That's rude.

271
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:18,184
There's nothing more important to me
than the Expo.

272
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:19,602
It's my primary point of concern.

273
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:22,855
- I don't know why you're...
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

274
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,691
Wow. Look at that.

275
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:28,319
That's modern art. That's going up.

276
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:31,155
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

277
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,449
- This is vital.
- Stark is in complete disarray.

278
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,868
- You understand that?
- No. Our stocks have never been higher.

279
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:38,287
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,

280
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:39,872
- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.

281
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:41,541
- Let's move on to another subject.
- No, no, no, no.

282
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,334
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman

283
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:44,919
- and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.

284
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,254
I'm just replacing it with this.

285
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,714
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

286
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,925
My point is,
we have already awarded contracts

287
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,677
- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

288
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,846
- I'm already feeling gassy.
- And to the plastic plantation tree,

289
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,056
which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...

290
00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:58,933
- Everything was my idea.
...and you won't make a decision.

291
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,727
I don't care
about the liberal agenda any more.

292
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:03,187
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

293
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:05,565
- You do it.
- I do what?

294
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,608
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

295
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,486
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

296
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:11,988
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

297
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:13,740
- give me the information...
- I'm not asking you to try...

298
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:14,949
...in order to...
- I'm asking you

299
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,242
to physically do it. I need you to do it.

300
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:18,077
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

301
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:20,079
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.

302
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:22,040
Why won't you let me?

303
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:25,585
- Have you been drinking?
- Chlorophyll.

304
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:31,758
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

305
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,760
effective immediately.

306
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,847
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

307
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,893
I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought,

308
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:45,897
believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

309
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:49,859
trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.

310
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:51,736
And then I realised

311
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:56,824
it's you. It's always been you.

312
00:21:58,868 --> 00:21:59,952
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

313
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:03,498
but actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.

314
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:06,209
My successor being you.

315
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,046
Congratulations?

316
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,383
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

317
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:15,259
Don't think. Drink.

318
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:21,099
There you go.

319
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:05,727
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

320
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,729
I'm on happy time.

321
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:15,194
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

322
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,697
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

323
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,866
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

324
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:22,410
All right, put them up. Come on.

325
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:29,959
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

326
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,546
I need you to initial each box.

327
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:36,883
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...

328
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,386
That's it. I'm done.

329
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:42,889
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

330
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:44,557
Front and centre. Come into the church.

331
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:48,436
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
- lf it pleases the court, which it does.

332
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,856
- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

333
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:06,579
What?

334
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:13,127
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

335
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,380
- Pepper.
- What?

336
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:18,716
- Who is she?
- She is from legal.

337
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:22,887
And she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit

338
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:25,139
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.

339
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:28,017
Yes, and I've got
three excellent potential candidates.

340
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,644
They're lined up and ready to meet you.

341
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,605
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.

342
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,773
No, it's not.

343
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:35,650
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

344
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:39,696
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot
Camp? Crunch? Something like that?

345
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:43,533
- How do I spell your name, Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

346
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:48,037
- What, are you gonna google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

347
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:51,791
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
- You're so predictable, you know that?

348
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,043
She's fluent in French, Italian,
Russian, Latin.

349
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:56,004
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

350
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:58,381
- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.

351
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:00,258
You can read Latin
or you can write Latin,

352
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:01,926
- but you can't speak Latin...
- Did you model in Tokyo?

353
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:03,761
- 'Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
- Well...

354
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:05,221
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.

355
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:08,933
Rule number one,
never take your eye off your opponent.

356
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:11,561
Oh, my God!

357
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:16,566
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

358
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:17,984
- I just slipped.
- You did?

359
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:20,403
- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.

360
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,949
Just... I need your impression.

361
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:27,744
You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.

362
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:30,330
- I meant your fingerprint.
- Right.

363
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:36,711
- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

364
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:41,174
- You're the boss.
- Will that be all, Mr Stark?

365
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:43,217
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.

366
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:45,136
Thank you very much.

367
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:49,807
- I want one.
- No.

368
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:26,094
You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,

369
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,428
- just go with it.
- Go with it? Go with what?

370
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,055
- Mr Stark?
- Hey.

371
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,348
Hello. How was your flight?

372
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:31,933
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.

373
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:36,187
We have one photographer
from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

374
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:38,356
- When did this happen?
- What? You made me do it.

375
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:40,984
- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile. Look right there.

376
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:42,193
Stop acting constipated.

377
00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:43,736
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

378
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:44,862
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

379
00:26:44,988 --> 00:26:46,656
- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.

380
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:48,574
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

381
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,576
You have a 9:30 dinner.

382
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:52,412
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00.
- Absolutely.

383
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:54,330
- Is this us?
- It can be.

384
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:56,082
- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.

385
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:58,626
- Mr Musk. How are you?
- Hi, Pepper.

386
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,586
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

387
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:02,922
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

388
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:05,008
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea
for an electric jet.

389
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,175
- You do?
- Yeah.

390
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:08,303
Then we'll make it work.

391
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,138
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No,

392
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:11,681
- I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...

393
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:13,182
- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.

394
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:14,434
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

395
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,643
Thank you very much.

396
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,687
- Green is not your best colour.
- Oh, please.

397
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:19,314
Anthony! Is that you?

398
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,690
- My least favourite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.

399
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:22,066
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

400
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,944
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

401
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:27,447
You know Christine Everhart
from <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

402
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:28,656
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

403
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:29,991
- Yes.
- Yes.

404
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:31,242
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

405
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:35,371
BTW, big story.
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

406
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:36,748
- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.

407
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:40,293
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

408
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:41,544
- Can I?
- Sure.

409
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:44,130
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

410
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:46,132
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

411
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:47,300
- Right.
- Right?

412
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:50,762
Well, she did quite a spread
on Tony last year.

413
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:52,180
And she wrote a story as well.

414
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:54,307
- It was very impressive.
- That was good.

415
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:56,434
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

416
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,977
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

417
00:27:58,102 --> 00:27:59,520
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.

418
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:00,897
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

419
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:03,608
- Can I ask you... Is this the first time...
- <i>Fromage.</i>

420
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,193
- Say, "Brie."
...that you guys have seen each other?

421
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:07,528
God, that's so awful.

422
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:09,989
Listen, is it the first time you've seen
each other since the Senate?

423
00:28:10,114 --> 00:28:11,741
Since he got his contract revoked...

424
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:14,035
- Actually, it's on hold.
...when you were attempting to...

425
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,120
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"

426
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:18,039
- and "cancelled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?

427
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,500
No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?

428
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:24,587
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

429
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:27,048
Well, if you invent something
that works,

430
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,549
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

431
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,843
- Mr Stark, your corner table is ready.
- Yes?

432
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,137
I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.

433
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:36,391
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.

434
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:38,434
We kid. We're kidders.

435
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:02,834
Got any other bad ideas?

436
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,214
Tony!

437
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:16,347
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

438
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,891
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

439
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,477
for Hammer Industries, you know?

440
00:29:21,602 --> 00:29:24,897
- Everything that Tony and I do...
- <i>Well, what's the use of having...</i>

441
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:27,859
...is a healthy...
- <i>... and owning a race car...</i>

442
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:30,903
...competition.
- <i>... if you don't drive it?</i>

443
00:29:31,988 --> 00:29:33,489
Is he driving?

444
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:42,457
Natalie. Natalie!

445
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,584
- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?

446
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,878
This is the first that I have known of it.

447
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:48,713
This... This cannot happen.

448
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,465
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

449
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,799
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

450
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,760
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

451
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:56,638
Tony's... You know, he...

452
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,598
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

453
00:29:58,723 --> 00:29:59,766
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

454
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:02,810
- can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.

455
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,103
- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.

456
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:05,438
But I have to make one quick phone call.

457
00:30:05,563 --> 00:30:06,606
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

458
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:08,066
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

459
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:09,651
- I'll be right back.
- Look!

460
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:11,235
That's Stark.

461
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,480
Go, go!

462
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:15,360
Hang on.

463
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:26,139
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

464
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:27,807
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

465
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:29,058
Car!

466
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:34,123
Oh, my God!

467
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:43,257
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

468
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,260
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

469
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:48,346
- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

470
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:50,390
- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!

471
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:52,225
I was attacked! We need better security.

472
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,560
- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.

473
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:56,396
God, it's embarrassing.

474
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:59,482
First vacation in two years.

475
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:05,571
Oh, my God!

476
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:08,908
- I got him!
- Hit him again. Hit him again.

477
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:10,868
Football.

478
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:15,373
- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!

479
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:17,125
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

480
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,043
Stop banging the car!

481
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:23,548
Calm down.

482
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:26,467
God! God!

483
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:31,806
Give me the case! Please! Come on!

484
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:05,858
You... You lose.

485
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,826
You lose. You lose, Stark.

486
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:12,050
Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.

487
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:20,725
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

488
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:26,189
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionised plasma channels.

489
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:29,192
It's effective. Not very efficient.

490
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:32,570
But it's a passable knock-off.

491
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:34,781
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,

492
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:36,658
you could have made a solid paycheck.

493
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:40,912
You could have sold it
to North Korea, China, Iran,

494
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:43,623
or gone right to the black market.

495
00:38:43,748 --> 00:38:46,668
You look like you got friends
in low places.

496
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:52,298
You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.

497
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:55,969
And now, like all guilty men,

498
00:38:56,928 --> 00:38:59,514
you try to rewrite your own history.

499
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:05,186
And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.

500
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:09,607
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

501
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:12,610
My father. Anton Vanko.

502
00:39:13,861 --> 00:39:15,989
Well, I never heard of him.

503
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:19,784
My father is the reason you're alive.

504
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:22,036
The reason I'm alive
is 'cause you had a shot, you took it,

505
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:23,663
you missed.

506
00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:24,956
Did I?

507
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,961
If you can make God bleed,

508
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,840
the people will cease to believe in him.

509
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:39,512
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

510
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:45,935
The truth,
all I have to do is sit here and watch

511
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,521
as the world will consume you.

512
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:50,690
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

513
00:39:50,815 --> 00:39:54,694
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

514
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,071
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

515
00:39:57,196 --> 00:40:00,533
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

516
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:21,429
<i>It's just unbelievable. It proves</i>
<i>that the genie is out of the bottle</i>

517
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:23,973
<i>and this man has no idea</i>
<i>what he's doing.</i>

518
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:27,810
<i>He thinks of the Iron Man weapon</i>
<i>as a toy.</i>

519
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:32,732
<i>I was at a hearing</i>
<i>where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant</i>

520
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:36,444
<i>that these suits</i>
<i>can't exist anywhere else,</i>

521
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:39,072
<i>don't exist anywhere else,</i>
<i>never will exist anywhere else,</i>

522
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:40,490
<i>at least for five to 10 years,</i>

523
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:45,203
<i>and here we are in Monaco realising,</i>
<i>"These suits exist now."</i>

524
00:40:45,328 --> 00:40:46,454
Mute.

525
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,043
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

526
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,384
- What is that?
- This is your in-flight meal.

527
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:04,555
Did you just make that?

528
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:08,059
Yeah. Where do you think I've been
for three hours?

529
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:10,228
Tony,

530
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:14,649
what are you not telling me?

531
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:21,572
I don't want to go home. At all.

532
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:26,536
Let's cancel my birthday party and...

533
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:29,205
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

534
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,498
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

535
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:32,458
It's a great place to

536
00:41:35,003 --> 00:41:38,089
- be healthy.
- I don't think this is the right time.

537
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:40,425
We're in kind of a mess.

538
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,135
Yeah, but maybe that's why
it's the best time.

539
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,262
- 'Cause then we...
- Well, I think as the CEO,

540
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:45,471
I need to show up.

541
00:41:45,596 --> 00:41:49,851
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

542
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:51,269
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

543
00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:53,896
- A retreat? During a time like this?
- Just a ride.

544
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:57,567
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

545
00:41:57,692 --> 00:42:00,403
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

546
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,495
Hey, there he is.

547
00:44:15,246 --> 00:44:16,664
There he is.

548
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:21,753
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.

549
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:23,880
Oh, goodness gracious.

550
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:27,508
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

551
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:31,095
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

552
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,974
I didn't want to make
a first impression like this.

553
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,310
He's not an animal. Come on.

554
00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:40,897
He's a human being. Thank you.

555
00:44:45,985 --> 00:44:47,362
We're fine.

556
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,698
My name is Justin Hammer.

557
00:44:50,823 --> 00:44:54,118
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.

558
00:44:57,872 --> 00:45:00,333
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?

559
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,753
- We have some salmon carpaccio.
- Salmon carpaccio.

560
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:07,048
Anything you want here, we got it.

561
00:45:07,173 --> 00:45:11,219
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in from San Francisco.

562
00:45:11,344 --> 00:45:13,179
It's Italian, though.

563
00:45:13,304 --> 00:45:15,056
Organic ice cream.

564
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:19,060
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

565
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,773
What I saw you do to Tony Stark
on that track,

566
00:45:23,898 --> 00:45:27,527
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

567
00:45:27,652 --> 00:45:29,737
that was... Wow!

568
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:31,364
You spoke to me with what you did.

569
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:34,075
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

570
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,702
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off

571
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:38,579
to God knows where. It would have been
such a waste of talent.

572
00:45:38,705 --> 00:45:39,998
But if I might make a suggestion,

573
00:45:40,123 --> 00:45:42,792
you know,
you don't just go and try and kill the guy.

574
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:47,130
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.

575
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:49,299
That's what you kill.

576
00:45:49,424 --> 00:45:52,385
You and me,
we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

577
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:57,098
The only difference between you and I
is that I have resources.

578
00:45:57,974 --> 00:46:00,351
I think, if I may,

579
00:46:00,476 --> 00:46:02,770
you need my resources.

580
00:46:02,895 --> 00:46:05,440
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

581
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:07,567
I'd like to be that guy.

582
00:46:19,537 --> 00:46:23,791
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

583
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:26,711
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

584
00:46:26,836 --> 00:46:28,212
Very good, man.

585
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:31,466
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

586
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:32,675
Hey!

587
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,387
- Hey.
- Yes?

588
00:46:36,512 --> 00:46:38,056
I want my bird.

589
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:43,728
- A bird? You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

590
00:46:43,853 --> 00:46:45,480
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

591
00:46:45,605 --> 00:46:47,106
I want my bird.

592
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:49,734
Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible. I could...

593
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:53,488
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird back in Russia?

594
00:46:53,613 --> 00:46:56,616
Yes, but the fundamentals
of the company are still very, very strong

595
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:58,618
- despite the events in Monaco.
- Yes, of course.

596
00:46:58,743 --> 00:47:02,163
- The AP wants a quote.
- Don't tell him. Fax them...

597
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:03,748
Where is he?

598
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:05,625
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
- He's downstairs.

599
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,168
- <i>... what happened in Monaco?</i>
- Yes, but...

600
00:47:07,293 --> 00:47:09,754
<i>But his continuing erratic behaviour</i>

601
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:11,965
<i>may lead many people</i>
<i>to ask themselves,</i>

602
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,883
<i>"Can this man still protect us?"</i>

603
00:47:14,008 --> 00:47:17,261
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.

604
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:22,934
<i>Query complete, sir.</i>
<i>Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist</i>

605
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:26,020
<i>who defected to the United States</i>
<i>in 1963.</i>

606
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:30,274
<i>However, he was accused of espionage</i>
<i>and was deported in 1967.</i>

607
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,735
<i>His son, lvan, who is also a physicist,</i>

608
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:37,573
<i>was convicted of selling Soviet-era</i>
<i>weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,</i>

609
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:40,159
<i>and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.</i>

610
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:42,328
<i>No further records exist.</i>

611
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:48,543
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

612
00:47:48,668 --> 00:47:50,878
and get on top
of this situation right now.

613
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:55,216
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

614
00:47:55,341 --> 00:47:58,136
trying to talk them out
of rolling tanks up the PCH,

615
00:47:58,261 --> 00:48:01,097
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

616
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:03,224
They're gonna take your suits,
Tony, okay?

617
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:05,226
They're sick of the games.

618
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:08,521
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

619
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:11,816
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.

620
00:48:11,941 --> 00:48:14,235
It's not theoretical any more.

621
00:48:15,486 --> 00:48:17,488
Are you listening to me?

622
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:22,744
- Are you okay?
- Let's go.

623
00:48:25,663 --> 00:48:28,166
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

624
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:33,880
- You all right?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

625
00:48:34,005 --> 00:48:36,090
- See that cigar box?
- Yeah.

626
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:38,051
It's palladium.

627
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:46,559
Is that supposed to be smoking?

628
00:48:46,684 --> 00:48:50,897
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.

629
00:48:54,692 --> 00:48:56,778
You had this in your body?

630
00:49:01,658 --> 00:49:05,453
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

631
00:49:05,578 --> 00:49:06,913
Road rash.

632
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:11,709
Thank you.

633
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:26,641
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

634
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:29,769
You wanna do
this whole lone gunslinger act

635
00:49:29,894 --> 00:49:31,896
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

636
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,190
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

637
00:49:34,315 --> 00:49:36,526
But you've gotta trust me.

638
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:40,405
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

639
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:51,457
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

640
00:49:51,582 --> 00:49:55,003
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?

641
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:56,504
No pressure.

642
00:49:56,629 --> 00:49:59,590
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

643
00:49:59,716 --> 00:50:01,134
I may have done a few miscalculations

644
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:03,219
and rushed the prototype
into production.

645
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:05,179
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

646
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:07,557
Go ahead, take a look around.

647
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:14,272
You don't wanna do that.

648
00:50:14,397 --> 00:50:15,982
You'll be able to access that

649
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:17,984
as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.

650
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:20,153
Can we generate
some encrypted pass codes?

651
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:23,364
Get some of those
encrypted pass codes, Jack.

652
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:26,200
Never mind, I...

653
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:30,747
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

654
00:50:33,249 --> 00:50:35,543
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

655
00:50:37,837 --> 00:50:39,047
Well...

656
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:41,966
You're good.

657
00:50:42,258 --> 00:50:45,386
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

658
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:49,515
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

659
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,517
Go ahead, take a look.

660
00:50:52,477 --> 00:50:55,063
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

661
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:57,148
You know,
those are really just for show and tell.

662
00:50:57,273 --> 00:51:02,236
They're $125.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.

663
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:07,200
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

664
00:51:08,117 --> 00:51:10,662
That's where the pilot goes.

665
00:51:10,787 --> 00:51:14,791
I'm having a tough time
finding volunteers.

666
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:18,044
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

667
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:19,629
What you want them do?

668
00:51:19,754 --> 00:51:24,926
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

669
00:51:25,051 --> 00:51:27,053
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

670
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:28,262
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

671
00:51:28,388 --> 00:51:30,264
I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.

672
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,766
You know what I'm talking about?

673
00:51:31,891 --> 00:51:34,018
- I can do that. No problem.
- Yeah?

674
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:36,270
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

675
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:39,107
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

676
00:51:48,658 --> 00:51:51,077
Do you know which watch
you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

677
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:53,371
I'll give them a look.

678
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:57,750
I should cancel the party.

679
00:51:58,876 --> 00:52:00,086
- Probably.
- Yeah.

680
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:02,797
- 'Cause it's...
- Ill-timed.

681
00:52:02,922 --> 00:52:04,382
Right, sends the wrong message.

682
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:05,967
Inappropriate.

683
00:52:11,848 --> 00:52:14,100
Is that dirty enough for you?

684
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:18,855
Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

685
00:52:19,397 --> 00:52:20,815
Bring them over here.

686
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,237
I'll take that. Why don't you...

687
00:52:38,374 --> 00:52:40,668
I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.

688
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,129
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

689
00:52:45,882 --> 00:52:47,967
Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?

690
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:49,344
Bit odd.

691
00:52:49,677 --> 00:52:53,014
If this was your last birthday party
you were ever gonna have,

692
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:54,682
how would you celebrate it?

693
00:52:57,393 --> 00:53:01,522
I'd do whatever I wanted to do
with whoever I wanted to do it with.

694
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:34,347
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

695
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:37,225
Yes, sir, I understand.

696
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:41,562
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

697
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:43,982
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,

698
00:53:44,107 --> 00:53:45,900
Iron Man will be back on watch.

699
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:54,659
Hey, Pepper.

700
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:57,120
I'm going to go get some air.

701
00:53:57,245 --> 00:53:58,579
What's wrong?

702
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:01,666
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

703
00:54:07,922 --> 00:54:10,508
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
- No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

704
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:12,510
This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

705
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:13,845
I know. I know. I get it.

706
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,179
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.

707
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:18,182
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

708
00:54:19,434 --> 00:54:21,060
<i>You know, the question</i>
<i>I get asked most often is,</i>

709
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:23,646
<i>"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom</i>
<i>in the suit?"</i>

710
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:28,484
<i>Just like that.</i>

711
00:54:32,155 --> 00:54:35,033
<i>Does this guy know</i>
<i>how to throw a party or what?</i>

712
00:54:38,786 --> 00:54:39,787
<i>I love you.</i>

713
00:54:39,912 --> 00:54:42,540
<i>Unbelievable! Thank you so much.</i>

714
00:54:42,665 --> 00:54:46,586
<i>Tony, we all thank you so much</i>
<i>for such a wonderful night.</i>

715
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:50,673
<i>And we're gonna say good night now,</i>
<i>and thank you all for coming.</i>

716
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:51,966
<i>No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.</i>

717
00:54:52,091 --> 00:54:53,843
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.

718
00:54:53,968 --> 00:54:56,721
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

719
00:54:56,846 --> 00:54:59,140
- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.

720
00:54:59,265 --> 00:55:00,350
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be

721
00:55:00,475 --> 00:55:01,643
- happy about this.
- Come on, you know you want to.

722
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:03,102
You just peed the suit.

723
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:04,646
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

724
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,147
You could drink that water.

725
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:09,817
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

726
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:11,653
- lf you say so.
- Okay.

727
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:13,905
I'll take this, you take that.

728
00:55:15,365 --> 00:55:16,950
<i>Pepper Potts.</i>

729
00:55:18,284 --> 00:55:19,786
<i>She's right. The party's over.</i>

730
00:55:19,911 --> 00:55:22,830
<i>Then again, the party was over for me,</i>
<i>like, an hour and a half ago.</i>

731
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:26,417
<i>The after-party starts in 15 minutes.</i>

732
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:34,175
And if anybody, Pepper,
doesn't like it, there's the door.

733
00:55:40,682 --> 00:55:42,016
Yeah!

734
00:55:46,437 --> 00:55:47,647
Hit!

735
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:56,030
Pull!

736
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:06,499
Pull!

737
00:56:15,508 --> 00:56:17,677
I think she wants the Gallagher!

738
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:28,938
I'm only gonna say this once.

739
00:56:32,483 --> 00:56:33,776
Get out.

740
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:43,369
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

741
00:56:45,038 --> 00:56:46,164
<i>Goldstein.</i>

742
00:56:47,457 --> 00:56:48,625
Yes, Mr Stark?

743
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,961
Give me a phat beat
to beat my buddy's ass to.

744
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:57,759
I told you to shut it down.

745
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:11,856
Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.

746
00:57:18,613 --> 00:57:19,864
Really?

747
00:57:27,664 --> 00:57:31,209
Sorry, pal,
but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

748
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:34,045
Sidekick this!

749
00:57:42,595 --> 00:57:44,055
Had enough?

750
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:46,432
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

751
00:57:46,557 --> 00:57:48,643
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.

752
00:57:48,768 --> 00:57:50,770
You know what?
Ever since you came here...

753
00:57:54,524 --> 00:57:55,525
Pepper!

754
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,403
Get out of here. Get out of here.

755
00:58:04,701 --> 00:58:07,412
You want it? Take it!

756
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,871
Put your hand down.

757
00:58:49,996 --> 00:58:52,165
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

758
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,708
We don't have to do this, Tony.

759
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:55,501
You wanna be the War Machine,
take your shot.

760
00:58:55,627 --> 00:58:57,420
- Put it down!
- You gonna take a shot?

761
00:58:57,545 --> 00:58:58,755
- Put it down!
- No!

762
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,298
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it.

763
01:00:11,452 --> 01:00:13,746
<i>Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant</i>
<i>Colonel James Rhodes,</i>

764
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:17,041
<i>inbound from three miles east</i>
<i>at 5,000 feet...</i>

765
01:01:01,502 --> 01:01:02,795
Colonel.

766
01:01:03,796 --> 01:01:05,006
Major.

767
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:06,883
Wow.

768
01:01:08,134 --> 01:01:09,385
Yeah.

769
01:01:11,262 --> 01:01:13,139
Let's take it inside.

770
01:01:13,264 --> 01:01:14,724
Clear the area.

771
01:01:37,497 --> 01:01:38,665
Sir!

772
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:41,209
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the doughnut.

773
01:01:45,296 --> 01:01:47,423
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

774
01:01:48,341 --> 01:01:51,970
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

775
01:01:52,095 --> 01:01:55,264
- How's that working out for you?
- It's... It's... It's...

776
01:01:56,808 --> 01:01:58,101
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

777
01:01:58,226 --> 01:01:59,978
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

778
01:02:01,145 --> 01:02:02,188
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

779
01:02:02,313 --> 01:02:04,607
I'm not sure if you're real
or if I'm having...

780
01:02:04,732 --> 01:02:06,776
I am very real.

781
01:02:06,901 --> 01:02:08,861
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

782
01:02:09,404 --> 01:02:12,615
- Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
- That's not looking so good.

783
01:02:13,408 --> 01:02:15,368
I've been worse.

784
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:18,079
We've secured the perimeter,

785
01:02:18,204 --> 01:02:21,040
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

786
01:02:24,669 --> 01:02:27,463
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

787
01:02:28,214 --> 01:02:31,384
Tony, I want you to meet
Agent Romanoff.

788
01:02:31,509 --> 01:02:32,593
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

789
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:35,305
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

790
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,223
I suggest you apologise.

791
01:02:37,348 --> 01:02:38,850
You've been very busy.

792
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:42,186
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

793
01:02:42,312 --> 01:02:45,273
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

794
01:02:45,398 --> 01:02:46,733
Now, if I didn't know better...

795
01:02:46,858 --> 01:02:48,818
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

796
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:51,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

797
01:02:51,696 --> 01:02:54,866
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

798
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:57,744
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

799
01:02:57,869 --> 01:02:59,037
Is that possible?

800
01:02:59,162 --> 01:03:01,748
Well, according to Mr Stark's
database security guidelines,

801
01:03:01,873 --> 01:03:04,834
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorised usage.

802
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,256
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you?

803
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:12,216
What do you want from me?

804
01:03:12,342 --> 01:03:15,970
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

805
01:03:16,095 --> 01:03:19,307
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the centre of my universe.

806
01:03:19,432 --> 01:03:22,435
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

807
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,561
Hit him.

808
01:03:24,812 --> 01:03:28,107
Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

809
01:03:28,608 --> 01:03:31,486
Could you please not do anything awful
for five seconds?

810
01:03:32,111 --> 01:03:35,698
- What did she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

811
01:03:35,823 --> 01:03:38,201
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

812
01:03:38,326 --> 01:03:40,161
We're trying to get you back to work.

813
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:42,330
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

814
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:44,332
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

815
01:03:44,457 --> 01:03:46,918
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

816
01:03:47,043 --> 01:03:49,212
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

817
01:03:49,337 --> 01:03:51,673
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

818
01:03:51,798 --> 01:03:56,177
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

819
01:03:56,302 --> 01:03:59,347
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

820
01:04:00,848 --> 01:04:03,935
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

821
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,561
Candygram.

822
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:11,234
I brought you something.

823
01:04:11,859 --> 01:04:13,569
Oh, yeah.

824
01:04:16,155 --> 01:04:17,949
We got you the bird, pal.

825
01:04:18,074 --> 01:04:19,367
This is not my bird.

826
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:21,869
What do you mean?
That's the bird. This is the bird.

827
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:24,747
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

828
01:04:24,872 --> 01:04:26,124
This is a great bird.

829
01:04:26,249 --> 01:04:28,835
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

830
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,379
Hey, man, this not my bird.

831
01:04:33,756 --> 01:04:37,635
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

832
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,513
I mean, you know, look,
don't get so attached to things.

833
01:04:40,638 --> 01:04:42,307
Learn to let go.

834
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:47,562
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

835
01:04:48,146 --> 01:04:51,232
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

836
01:04:59,782 --> 01:05:03,286
lvan... What's this? Jack.

837
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:06,289
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

838
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:08,958
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

839
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,877
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

840
01:05:11,002 --> 01:05:14,172
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

841
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:16,924
See, lvan?
He can't put his head in there.

842
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:21,387
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

843
01:05:21,512 --> 01:05:24,849
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

844
01:05:25,224 --> 01:05:27,310
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

845
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:29,979
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

846
01:05:30,104 --> 01:05:31,856
People make problem.

847
01:05:31,981 --> 01:05:33,816
Trust me. Drone better.

848
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:38,446
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

849
01:05:39,364 --> 01:05:41,157
You said, "No problem."

850
01:05:41,282 --> 01:05:44,160
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

851
01:05:44,285 --> 01:05:47,038
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

852
01:05:47,163 --> 01:05:49,123
Like Iron Man. You understand?

853
01:05:49,248 --> 01:05:52,335
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

854
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:54,504
Hey, man.

855
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:58,633
Don't get too attached to things.

856
01:05:59,384 --> 01:06:01,052
Learn to let go.

857
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:07,141
These drones
better steal the show, lvan.

858
01:06:07,809 --> 01:06:11,187
You understand?
Better rock my world, lvan.

859
01:06:20,822 --> 01:06:22,448
Unbelievable.

860
01:06:22,949 --> 01:06:25,576
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

861
01:06:25,702 --> 01:06:29,038
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

862
01:06:29,455 --> 01:06:32,792
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponise it.

863
01:06:33,835 --> 01:06:34,836
Sir?

864
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:37,547
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

865
01:06:37,672 --> 01:06:39,257
We'd like this to introduce it.

866
01:06:39,382 --> 01:06:40,925
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

867
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:43,803
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

868
01:06:43,928 --> 01:06:46,931
- We've got to make this happen.
- Yes, General, but...

869
01:06:47,056 --> 01:06:49,017
It's also an order.

870
01:06:49,434 --> 01:06:50,727
Yes, sir.

871
01:06:51,144 --> 01:06:54,564
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

872
01:06:54,689 --> 01:06:56,274
Thank you, sir.

873
01:07:02,488 --> 01:07:06,159
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

874
01:07:06,284 --> 01:07:07,285
No, it was finished.

875
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:11,497
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturised it and put it in my...

876
01:07:11,623 --> 01:07:13,708
No. Howard said the arc reactor

877
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:15,543
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

878
01:07:15,668 --> 01:07:20,131
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

879
01:07:20,673 --> 01:07:21,758
He was on to something big,

880
01:07:21,883 --> 01:07:25,303
something so big that it was gonna
make the nuclear reactor

881
01:07:25,428 --> 01:07:27,388
look like a triple-A battery.

882
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:29,974
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

883
01:07:30,099 --> 01:07:33,144
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

884
01:07:33,269 --> 01:07:35,271
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

885
01:07:35,396 --> 01:07:37,732
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

886
01:07:37,857 --> 01:07:39,734
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

887
01:07:39,859 --> 01:07:41,361
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

888
01:07:41,486 --> 01:07:44,197
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

889
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:46,824
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

890
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:51,037
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

891
01:07:51,454 --> 01:07:52,747
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

892
01:07:52,872 --> 01:07:55,041
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

893
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:59,379
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

894
01:07:59,545 --> 01:08:01,506
to finish what he started.

895
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:03,091
He said that?

896
01:08:03,299 --> 01:08:05,885
Are you that guy? Are you?

897
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:11,265
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

898
01:08:15,603 --> 01:08:17,021
I don't know
where you get your information,

899
01:08:17,146 --> 01:08:19,357
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

900
01:08:19,482 --> 01:08:20,817
What do you remember
about your dad?

901
01:08:20,942 --> 01:08:22,610
He was cold, he was calculating.

902
01:08:22,735 --> 01:08:25,446
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,

903
01:08:25,571 --> 01:08:27,115
so it's a little tough for me to digest

904
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,659
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

905
01:08:29,784 --> 01:08:32,704
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

906
01:08:32,829 --> 01:08:34,038
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

907
01:08:34,163 --> 01:08:35,623
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

908
01:08:35,748 --> 01:08:36,791
That's not true.

909
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:39,544
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

910
01:08:40,003 --> 01:08:43,631
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

911
01:08:43,756 --> 01:08:44,882
What?

912
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:47,510
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

913
01:08:47,635 --> 01:08:49,137
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

914
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:50,972
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

915
01:08:51,097 --> 01:08:52,932
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

916
01:08:53,057 --> 01:08:56,269
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

917
01:08:56,394 --> 01:08:59,272
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

918
01:08:59,731 --> 01:09:01,190
And Tony,

919
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:05,445
remember, I got my eye on you.

920
01:09:11,534 --> 01:09:14,746
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

921
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:16,205
Good luck.

922
01:09:20,335 --> 01:09:21,544
Please.

923
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:25,340
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

924
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:27,592
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

925
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:30,261
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

926
01:09:30,386 --> 01:09:31,471
I'm not here for that.

927
01:09:31,596 --> 01:09:33,014
I've been authorised by Director Fury

928
01:09:33,139 --> 01:09:35,558
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

929
01:09:35,683 --> 01:09:38,269
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

930
01:09:38,394 --> 01:09:41,564
I will tase you and watch <i>Supernanny</i>
while you drool into the carpet.

931
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:43,900
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

932
01:09:44,025 --> 01:09:45,860
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

933
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:13,846
Think this is the power source?

934
01:10:13,972 --> 01:10:18,726
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

935
01:10:19,894 --> 01:10:21,187
Yes, sir.

936
01:10:21,646 --> 01:10:22,897
Oh, yes!

937
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:25,233
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

938
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:27,068
Is it my birthday?

939
01:10:27,402 --> 01:10:30,780
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?

940
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,744
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

941
01:10:36,869 --> 01:10:39,914
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

942
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:41,582
What am I going to do for you?

943
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:44,711
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

944
01:10:44,836 --> 01:10:47,797
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

945
01:10:47,922 --> 01:10:50,216
I'm talking about firepower.

946
01:10:51,759 --> 01:10:53,803
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

947
01:10:55,138 --> 01:10:58,391
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

948
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:02,020
Too downtown? I agree.

949
01:11:02,603 --> 01:11:04,814
M24 shotgun, pump action.

950
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:06,733
Five-round magazine.

951
01:11:06,858 --> 01:11:08,151
You know what? You're not a hunter.

952
01:11:08,276 --> 01:11:10,320
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

953
01:11:10,445 --> 01:11:12,864
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

954
01:11:12,989 --> 01:11:15,241
They do make something
better than waffles.

955
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:18,202
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

956
01:11:18,328 --> 01:11:19,579
so I'm gonna put it right here.

957
01:11:19,704 --> 01:11:22,707
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

958
01:11:22,832 --> 01:11:25,835
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

959
01:11:26,127 --> 01:11:27,420
You're tough.

960
01:11:27,545 --> 01:11:30,006
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

961
01:11:30,131 --> 01:11:31,591
Don't let anyone tell you different.

962
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:35,303
This is an M1347.62 Minigun.

963
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:38,848
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

964
01:11:38,973 --> 01:11:41,059
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho,

965
01:11:41,184 --> 01:11:43,519
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

966
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:47,607
Okay.

967
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:53,321
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

968
01:11:55,031 --> 01:11:56,908
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle

969
01:11:57,033 --> 01:12:01,287
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

970
01:12:01,913 --> 01:12:05,375
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

971
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,627
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

972
01:12:07,752 --> 01:12:11,130
A book that would make <i>Ulysses</i>
look like it was written in crayon.

973
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:13,549
It would read it to you.

974
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:15,134
This is my Eiffel Tower.

975
01:12:15,259 --> 01:12:18,304
This is my Rachmaninoff's <i>Third.</i>
My <i>Pieta.</i>

976
01:12:18,429 --> 01:12:21,474
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

977
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:26,271
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

978
01:12:27,397 --> 01:12:29,274
I call it the Ex-Wife.

979
01:12:34,445 --> 01:12:36,322
That's the best I got.

980
01:12:41,452 --> 01:12:43,079
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

981
01:12:43,204 --> 01:12:47,333
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
- I think I'll take it.

982
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:50,086
- Which one?
- All of it.

983
01:12:52,088 --> 01:12:53,089
All of it.

984
01:13:30,543 --> 01:13:34,297
<i>Everything is achievable</i>
<i>through technology.</i>

985
01:13:34,422 --> 01:13:36,799
<i>Better living, robust health</i>

986
01:13:36,924 --> 01:13:42,722
<i>and for the first time in human history,</i>
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

987
01:13:43,264 --> 01:13:44,432
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

988
01:13:44,557 --> 01:13:48,561
<i>and everything you'll need for the future</i>
<i>can be found right here.</i>

989
01:13:48,686 --> 01:13:51,648
<i>City of the Future?</i>
<i>City of Tomorrow? City of...</i>

990
01:13:57,528 --> 01:13:58,655
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

991
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:02,617

992
01:14:02,742 --> 01:14:05,578
<i>So, from all of us at Stark Industries,</i>

993
01:14:05,703 --> 01:14:07,956
<i>I would like to personally...</i>

994
01:14:08,623 --> 01:14:10,833
<i>Tony, what are you doing back there?</i>
<i>What is that?</i>

995
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:14,504
<i>Put that back.</i>
<i>Put it back where you got it from.</i>

996
01:14:14,754 --> 01:14:16,881
<i>Where's your mother? Maria?</i>

997
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,217
<i>Go on. Go, go, go, go.</i>

998
01:14:21,552 --> 01:14:23,763
<i>All right, I think we got...</i>

999
01:14:24,138 --> 01:14:25,890
<i>I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...</i>

1000
01:14:29,852 --> 01:14:31,729
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

1001
01:14:33,564 --> 01:14:38,152
<i>So, from all of us at Stark Industries,</i>
<i>I'd like to personally show you</i>

1002
01:14:38,987 --> 01:14:39,988
<i>my ass.</i>

1003
01:14:40,113 --> 01:14:42,156
<i>I'd like to... I can't... This is...</i>

1004
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:44,617
<i>I can't... We have this, don't we?</i>

1005
01:14:44,742 --> 01:14:47,662
<i>This is a ridiculous way...</i>

1006
01:14:48,162 --> 01:14:49,622
<i>Everything</i>

1007
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:52,125
<i>is achievable</i>

1008
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:54,752
<i>through technology.</i>

1009
01:15:07,265 --> 01:15:08,391
<i>Tony?</i>

1010
01:15:08,516 --> 01:15:10,351
<i>You're too young</i>
<i>to understand this right now,</i>

1011
01:15:10,476 --> 01:15:13,438
<i>so I thought</i>
<i>I would put it on film for you.</i>

1012
01:15:15,315 --> 01:15:17,150
<i>I built this for you.</i>

1013
01:15:18,151 --> 01:15:20,737
<i>And someday you'll realise</i>
<i>that it represents a whole lot more</i>

1014
01:15:20,862 --> 01:15:24,782
<i>than just people's inventions.</i>
<i>It represents my life's work.</i>

1015
01:15:26,034 --> 01:15:28,328
<i>This is the key to the future.</i>

1016
01:15:31,289 --> 01:15:36,044
<i>I'm limited by the technology of my time,</i>
<i>but one day you'll figure this out.</i>

1017
01:15:36,961 --> 01:15:38,630
<i>And when you do,</i>

1018
01:15:39,589 --> 01:15:41,674
<i>you will change the world.</i>

1019
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:47,055
<i>What is and always will be</i>
<i>my greatest creation</i>

1020
01:15:49,474 --> 01:15:50,808
<i>is you.</i>

1021
01:16:11,829 --> 01:16:14,582
- $6. Six.
- I don't have any dough.

1022
01:16:14,707 --> 01:16:16,250
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

1023
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:17,543
No, it's fine. Take that.

1024
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:19,629
- It's fine.
- No, <i>senor.</i>

1025
01:16:19,921 --> 01:16:22,840
Take it. Take it.
I don't like people handing me things.

1026
01:16:22,966 --> 01:16:24,842
If you just drop that there,
that'd be great.

1027
01:16:25,218 --> 01:16:27,804
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

1028
01:16:28,012 --> 01:16:29,722
We believe in you.

1029
01:16:30,181 --> 01:16:32,892
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

1030
01:16:33,309 --> 01:16:34,394
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

1031
01:16:34,519 --> 01:16:35,520
- Mr Stark...
- Is here.

1032
01:16:35,645 --> 01:16:37,480
- He refuses...
- I don't. It's fine.

1033
01:16:37,605 --> 01:16:40,108
- I'll just be a second.
- Listen, it's our position

1034
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:42,485
that Stark has and continues to maintain

1035
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:45,280
proprietary ownership
of the Mark II platform.

1036
01:16:45,405 --> 01:16:48,116
<i>When Mr Stark announced</i>
<i>he was indeed Iron Man,</i>

1037
01:16:48,241 --> 01:16:50,410
- <i>he was making a promise to America.</i>
- No, the suit belongs to us.

1038
01:16:50,535 --> 01:16:52,412
<i>We trusted that he would look out for us.</i>

1039
01:16:52,537 --> 01:16:54,580
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
- <i>He obviously did not.</i>

1040
01:16:54,706 --> 01:16:57,000
- <i>And now we learn that his secretary...</i>
- Yes, it does.

1041
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,419
<i>... a woman named</i>
<i>Virginia "Pepper" Potts,</i>

<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

1044
01:17:03,965 --> 01:17:05,008
- No.
- <i>Ms Potts is doing</i>

1045
01:17:05,133 --> 01:17:06,217
<i>nothing to manage this terrible...</i>

1046
01:17:06,342 --> 01:17:07,802
- Mute.
- No...

1047
01:17:08,678 --> 01:17:10,638
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.

1048
01:17:10,763 --> 01:17:13,182
Don't tell me that we have
the best patent lawyers in the country

1049
01:17:13,308 --> 01:17:15,351
and then not let me pursue this.

1050
01:17:15,768 --> 01:17:16,811
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1051
01:17:16,936 --> 01:17:19,731
Well, then, tell the President
to sign an order.

1052
01:17:20,565 --> 01:17:21,983
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

1053
01:17:22,108 --> 01:17:25,069
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

1054
01:17:25,194 --> 01:17:28,031
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

1055
01:17:28,698 --> 01:17:30,950
- No, he will not. Bye.
- I would like to be.

1056
01:17:32,243 --> 01:17:33,286
- Got a minute?
- No.

1057
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:36,122
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

1058
01:17:37,582 --> 01:17:39,876
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

1059
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:41,586
I was just driving over here,

1060
01:17:41,711 --> 01:17:44,172
and I thought I was coming
to basically apologise, but I'm not.

1061
01:17:44,297 --> 01:17:47,050
- You didn't come here to apologise?
- Look, that goes without saying,

1062
01:17:47,175 --> 01:17:48,718
and I'm working on that.

1063
01:17:48,843 --> 01:17:52,764
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

1064
01:17:52,889 --> 01:17:54,057
and I just want to try to make good.

1065
01:17:54,182 --> 01:17:56,434
Can I move this? This is crazy.

1066
01:17:56,559 --> 01:17:57,644
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1067
01:17:57,769 --> 01:17:58,853
- I'm trying to get some...
- No.

1068
01:18:01,648 --> 01:18:03,983
Do you know how short life is?

1069
01:18:04,108 --> 01:18:07,111
And if I never got to express...

1070
01:18:07,236 --> 01:18:09,864
And by the way,
this is somewhat revelatory to me.

1071
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:12,408
And I don't care...
I mean, I care. It would be nice.

1072
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:14,118
I'm not expecting you to...

1073
01:18:14,243 --> 01:18:15,370
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1074
01:18:15,495 --> 01:18:17,330
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Let me stop you right here, okay?

1075
01:18:17,455 --> 01:18:19,874
Because if you say "l" one more time,

1076
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:22,752
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

1077
01:18:23,378 --> 01:18:25,254
I am trying to run a company.

1078
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,882
- Do you have any idea what that entails?
- Yes.

1079
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:30,969
People are relying on you to be Iron Man
and you've disappeared,

1080
01:18:31,094 --> 01:18:34,389
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires
and taking the heat for it.

1081
01:18:37,058 --> 01:18:40,478
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

1082
01:18:44,274 --> 01:18:46,567
Did you bring me strawberries?

1083
01:18:47,735 --> 01:18:51,114
Did you know that there's only
one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

1084
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:53,449
Allergic to strawberries.

1085
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:57,036
This is progress, Pepper.

1086
01:18:57,161 --> 01:18:59,831
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

1087
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:02,000
- I need you...
- I need you, too.

1088
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:04,752
...to leave now.
- That's what I'm trying to...

1089
01:19:09,966 --> 01:19:11,342
Ms Potts?

1090
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:15,305
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1091
01:19:15,888 --> 01:19:17,223
Thank you.

1092
01:19:19,017 --> 01:19:20,476
- Anything else, boss?
- I'm good, Hap.

1093
01:19:20,602 --> 01:19:23,646
No, I'll be just... another minute.

1094
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:26,274
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1095
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,613
No.

1096
01:19:33,823 --> 01:19:38,911
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?

1097
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:42,290
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1098
01:19:42,415 --> 01:19:45,335
I thought you two didn't get along.

1099
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:48,713
- No. That's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

1100
01:19:48,963 --> 01:19:51,341
- No? Nothing?
- Actually, while you're here,

1101
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:54,510
maybe you and Natalie could discuss
the matter of the personal belongings.

1102
01:19:54,636 --> 01:19:56,012
Absolutely.

1103
01:20:02,518 --> 01:20:03,519
I'm surprised
you can keep your mouth shut.

1104
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:04,687
Boy, you're good.

1105
01:20:04,812 --> 01:20:07,315
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

1106
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,233
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

1107
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:11,611
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

1108
01:20:11,736 --> 01:20:12,779
Do you even speak Latin?

1109
01:20:14,989 --> 01:20:17,575
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

1110
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,912
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

1111
01:20:22,538 --> 01:20:23,957
You're good.

1112
01:21:23,766 --> 01:21:26,394
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form
a digital wire frame?

1113
01:21:26,519 --> 01:21:29,022
I need a manipulatable projection.

1114
01:21:36,321 --> 01:21:39,824
<i>1974 Stark Expo</i>
<i>model scan complete, sir.</i>

1115
01:21:42,118 --> 01:21:43,911
How many buildings are there?

1116
01:21:44,037 --> 01:21:46,456
<i>Am I to include</i>
<i>the Belgian waffle stands?</i>

1117
01:21:46,581 --> 01:21:49,083
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

1118
01:22:01,888 --> 01:22:06,476
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.

1119
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:10,021
In which case the nucleus
would be here.

1120
01:22:11,147 --> 01:22:13,191
Highlight the unisphere.

1121
01:22:22,033 --> 01:22:27,038
- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- <i>What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?</i>

1122
01:22:27,163 --> 01:22:28,957
I'm discovering... Correction.

1123
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:33,002
I'm rediscovering a new element,
I believe.

1124
01:22:33,836 --> 01:22:36,839
Lose the landscaping,
the shrubbery, the trees.

1125
01:22:36,965 --> 01:22:39,217
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

1126
01:22:44,055 --> 01:22:50,019
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

1127
01:22:53,147 --> 01:22:54,232
Dad.

1128
01:23:15,545 --> 01:23:20,258
Dead for almost 20 years,
and still taking me to school.

1129
01:23:26,514 --> 01:23:31,102
<i>The proposed element should serve</i>
<i>as a viable replacement for palladium.</i>

1130
01:23:31,227 --> 01:23:32,270
Thanks, Dad.

1131
01:23:32,395 --> 01:23:35,565
<i>Unfortunately, it is impossible</i>
<i>to synthesise.</i>

1132
01:23:40,153 --> 01:23:43,698
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

1133
01:24:31,537 --> 01:24:33,790
- I heard you broke the perimeter.
- Yeah.

1134
01:24:33,957 --> 01:24:35,792
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?

1135
01:24:35,959 --> 01:24:39,921
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

1136
01:24:40,046 --> 01:24:42,006
Hey, I'm playing for
the home team, Coulson,

1137
01:24:42,131 --> 01:24:44,175
you and all your
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1138
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,052
Now, are you gonna let me work
or break my balls?

1139
01:24:48,388 --> 01:24:50,348
What's this doing here?

1140
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:53,268
That's it.

1141
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,688
- Bring that to me.
- You know what this is?

1142
01:24:56,813 --> 01:24:58,273
It's exactly what I need
to make this work.

1143
01:25:00,275 --> 01:25:01,276
Lift the coil.

1144
01:25:01,818 --> 01:25:03,194
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

1145
01:25:03,861 --> 01:25:05,697
There you go. And...

1146
01:25:06,781 --> 01:25:08,658
Drop it. Drop it.

1147
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:14,956
Perfectly level.
I'm busy. What do you want?

1148
01:25:15,081 --> 01:25:18,209
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.

1149
01:25:18,835 --> 01:25:20,378
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

1150
01:25:20,503 --> 01:25:22,922
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
- So I'm told.

1151
01:25:23,047 --> 01:25:25,049
- Secret stuff?
- Something like that.

1152
01:25:26,509 --> 01:25:27,510
- Good luck.
- Bye.

1153
01:25:27,635 --> 01:25:29,679
- Thanks.
- We need you.

1154
01:25:29,804 --> 01:25:32,724
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

1155
01:25:51,117 --> 01:25:53,703
<i>Initialising prismatic accelerator.</i>

1156
01:25:59,834 --> 01:26:02,211
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

1157
01:26:49,759 --> 01:26:50,927
That was easy.

1158
01:27:07,527 --> 01:27:09,445
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

1159
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:13,700
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

1160
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:25,461
<i>Sir, the reactor has accepted</i>
<i>the modified core.</i>

1161
01:27:25,586 --> 01:27:28,131
<i>I will begin running diagnostics.</i>

1162
01:27:34,053 --> 01:27:35,388
Hey, lvan.

1163
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,307
<i>I got Senator Stern here.</i>

1164
01:27:37,432 --> 01:27:39,726
<i>Thought we'd swing over</i>
<i>and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

1165
01:27:39,851 --> 01:27:42,103
The drone is not going to be ready.

1166
01:27:42,395 --> 01:27:43,605
Not ready? What do you mean?

1167
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:47,150
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

1168
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:49,235
What the hell is the difference?

1169
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,113
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1170
01:27:52,405 --> 01:27:54,240
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1171
01:27:54,365 --> 01:27:57,452
What can you make them do? I mean,
this is a weapons demonstration.

1172
01:27:57,577 --> 01:28:00,872
- I can make salute.
- <i>You can make salute?</i>

1173
01:28:00,997 --> 01:28:02,332
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1174
01:28:02,457 --> 01:28:06,502
<i>What the hell does that mean, lvan?</i>
<i>This is not what we agreed to, okay?</i>

1175
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:09,213
<i>You promised me suits</i>
<i>and then you promised me drones.</i>

1176
01:28:09,339 --> 01:28:13,384
- Hey, man, everything will be okay.
- <i>This is not what I wanted.</i>

1177
01:28:25,563 --> 01:28:28,149
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

1178
01:28:29,734 --> 01:28:35,323
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1179
01:28:36,324 --> 01:28:39,661
You said it wasn't,
but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1180
01:28:39,786 --> 01:28:43,665
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what? Take the bird.

1181
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:46,584
Hey!

1182
01:28:48,711 --> 01:28:51,339
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

1183
01:28:52,632 --> 01:28:54,550
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

1184
01:28:58,638 --> 01:29:00,306
I took your stuff.

1185
01:29:00,431 --> 01:29:03,559
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?

1186
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:06,980
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1187
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:10,775
We had a contract.

1188
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:13,194
I saved your life

1189
01:29:13,987 --> 01:29:15,947
and you give me suits.

1190
01:29:16,531 --> 01:29:18,241
That was our deal.

1191
01:29:18,366 --> 01:29:20,368
And you did not deliver.

1192
01:29:21,244 --> 01:29:25,707
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

1193
01:29:28,084 --> 01:29:31,379
Something really, really great
fell into my lap.

1194
01:29:32,005 --> 01:29:35,216
And if it hadn't,
I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1195
01:29:35,508 --> 01:29:39,262
Now I have a piece of Stark tech
that I pimped out myself.

1196
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:41,264
And now your overpriced paperweights

1197
01:29:41,389 --> 01:29:43,933
are gonna look like a backdrop
to my demonstration.

1198
01:29:44,475 --> 01:29:46,644
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1199
01:29:48,938 --> 01:29:53,151
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

1200
01:29:56,613 --> 01:29:58,448
I'm gonna leave now.

1201
01:29:58,573 --> 01:30:01,618
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

1202
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:04,203
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

1203
01:30:04,412 --> 01:30:06,873
They are not to be trifled with.

1204
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:09,125
When I get back,
we're gonna renegotiate

1205
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:11,544
the terms of our agreement.

1206
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:14,172
And you're gonna make good
on our arrangement

1207
01:30:14,756 --> 01:30:15,840
because if you don't,

1208
01:30:15,965 --> 01:30:18,343
you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you,

1209
01:30:18,468 --> 01:30:20,094
a dead man.

1210
01:30:20,219 --> 01:30:21,596
You got that?

1211
01:30:22,597 --> 01:30:24,891
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1212
01:30:34,359 --> 01:30:36,694
Dummy, you, can we clean up
this mess? You're killing me.

1213
01:30:36,819 --> 01:30:38,196
- You know I don't...
- <i>Incoming call</i>

1214
01:30:38,321 --> 01:30:40,031
<i>with a blocked number, sir.</i>

1215
01:30:40,156 --> 01:30:43,326
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.

1216
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:44,869
Coulson.
How's the Land of Enchantment?

1217
01:30:44,994 --> 01:30:47,664
<i>Hey, Tony, how you doing?</i>

1218
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:51,292
- <i>I double cycle.</i>
- You what?

1219
01:30:52,335 --> 01:30:56,172
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

1220
01:30:56,547 --> 01:30:58,174
You sound pretty sprightly
for a dead guy.

1221
01:30:58,299 --> 01:30:59,759
<i>You, too.</i>

1222
01:31:02,387 --> 01:31:03,680
- Trace him.
- <i>Sir.</i>

1223
01:31:03,805 --> 01:31:07,517
Now, the true history of Stark name
will be written.

1224
01:31:07,642 --> 01:31:08,685
Jarvis, where is he?

1225
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:12,897
<i>Accessing the Oracle grid.</i>
<i>Eastern Seaboard.</i>

1226
01:31:13,022 --> 01:31:17,110
What your father did
to my family over 40 years,

1227
01:31:17,986 --> 01:31:20,571
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1228
01:31:20,822 --> 01:31:22,699
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.

1229
01:31:23,032 --> 01:31:24,325
<i>Tri-State area.</i>

1230
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:26,661
<i>Manhattan and outlying boroughs.</i>

1231
01:31:26,786 --> 01:31:28,663
I hope you're ready.

1232
01:31:31,457 --> 01:31:33,418
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

1233
01:31:44,053 --> 01:31:46,598
- <i>Sir...</i>
- You want to run some tests, run them.

1234
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:49,601
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

1235
01:31:49,726 --> 01:31:52,103
- <i>We are unclear as to the effects...</i>
- I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

1236
01:31:56,566 --> 01:31:58,610
That tastes like coconut.

1237
01:31:58,735 --> 01:32:00,403
And metal.

1238
01:32:00,778 --> 01:32:02,280
Oh, wow, yeah!

1239
01:32:14,959 --> 01:32:16,753
I'll keep the car down here, all right?

1240
01:32:16,878 --> 01:32:18,129
Thank you, Happy.

1241
01:32:18,254 --> 01:32:22,967
<i>... Justin Hammer. His presentation</i>
<i>will begin shortly in the main pavilion.</i>

1242
01:32:41,486 --> 01:32:42,695
<i>Yeah.</i>

1243
01:32:43,863 --> 01:32:47,158
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

1244
01:32:47,825 --> 01:32:49,744
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,</i>

1245
01:32:49,869 --> 01:32:54,374
<i>this country has had to place its</i>
<i>brave men and women in harm's way,</i>

1246
01:32:54,582 --> 01:32:56,167
<i>but then the Iron Man arrived,</i>

1247
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:59,921
<i>and we thought the days</i>
<i>of losing lives were behind us.</i>

1248
01:33:00,797 --> 01:33:03,508
<i>Sadly, that technology</i>
<i>was kept out of reach.</i>

1249
01:33:03,633 --> 01:33:05,927
<i>That's not fair. That's not right.</i>

1250
01:33:06,052 --> 01:33:08,263
- <i>And it's just too bad.</i>
- Oh, Lord.

1251
01:33:08,388 --> 01:33:10,431
<i>Regardless, it was</i>
<i>an impressive innovation,</i>

1252
01:33:10,556 --> 01:33:13,434
<i>one that grabbed headlines</i>
<i>the world over.</i>

1253

<i>Well, today, my friends,</i>

1254
01:33:15,561 --> 01:33:18,982
<i>the press is faced</i>
<i>with quite a different problem.</i>

1255
01:33:19,524 --> 01:33:21,985
<i>They are about to run out of ink.</i>

1256
01:33:27,573 --> 01:33:29,492
Get that out of here.

1257
01:33:30,493 --> 01:33:32,328
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1258
01:33:33,413 --> 01:33:35,915

<i>the new face</i>
<i>of the United States military.</i>

<i>The Hammer drone.</i>

01:33:44,465 --> 01:33:45,842
<i>Army!</i>

01:33:59,022 --> 01:34:00,148
<i>Navy!</i>

<i>Marines!</i>

1265

<i>Yeah!</i>

1266
01:34:34,349 --> 01:34:35,516
<i>Yeah!</i>

1267
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:41,898
<i>That's a hell of a lot better</i>
<i>than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.</i>

1268
01:34:43,274 --> 01:34:46,110
<i>But as revolutionary</i>
<i>as this technology is,</i>

1269
01:34:46,235 --> 01:34:49,906
<i>there will always be a need for man</i>
<i>to be present in the theatre of war.</i>

1270
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:53,534
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>today I am proud to present to you</i>

1271
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:55,370
<i>the very first prototype</i>

<i>in the Variable Threat Response</i>
<i>Battle Suit</i>

1273
01:34:58,873 --> 01:35:02,669
<i>and its pilot, Air Force</i>
<i>Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.</i>

1274
01:35:04,253 --> 01:35:05,463
What?

1275
01:35:26,401 --> 01:35:29,612
<i>For America and its allies,</i>
<i>Hammer Industries is reporting for...</i>

1276
01:35:46,671 --> 01:35:48,298
We got trouble.

1277
01:35:48,423 --> 01:35:50,091
Tony, there are civilians present.

1278
01:35:50,216 --> 01:35:52,802
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

1279
01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:54,178
Give them a wave.

1280
01:35:54,304 --> 01:35:56,431
<i>Hey, all right. Yeah.</i>

1281
01:35:56,556 --> 01:35:58,558
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

1282
01:35:58,683 --> 01:36:00,643
You gotta trust me
for the next five minutes.

1283
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:02,812
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

1284
01:36:02,937 --> 01:36:04,939
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

1285
01:36:05,064 --> 01:36:06,649
Vanko's alive?

1286
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,027
<i>Yeah.</i>

1287
01:36:09,152 --> 01:36:10,361
Where is he?

1288
01:36:10,778 --> 01:36:12,739
- What?
- Where's Vanko?

1289
01:36:13,239 --> 01:36:14,490
- Who?
- Tell me.

1290
01:36:15,158 --> 01:36:17,118
What are you doing here, man?

1291
01:36:17,243 --> 01:36:18,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1292
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:25,668
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

1293
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:29,422
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!

1294
01:36:30,256 --> 01:36:32,383
Get out of here. Go! This whole
system's been compromised.

1295
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:35,678
Let's take it outside.

1296
01:36:47,857 --> 01:36:49,067
No. No!

1297
01:36:59,077 --> 01:37:02,288
- Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1298
01:37:04,165 --> 01:37:07,043
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

1299
01:37:07,168 --> 01:37:08,753
- On what?
- On you.

1300
01:37:13,841 --> 01:37:15,635
Tony, on your six!

1301
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:35,321
- What's going on? What's happening?
- The software's been overridden.

1302
01:37:35,446 --> 01:37:36,614
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

1303
01:37:36,739 --> 01:37:38,032
- What does that mean?
- I think he slaved the drones.

1304
01:37:38,157 --> 01:37:39,242
That's impossible.

1305
01:37:39,367 --> 01:37:40,994
- Call the guards.
- All the phones are down, sir.

1306
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,204
Well, then call their... Call their cells.

1307
01:37:43,329 --> 01:37:44,831
Their cell phones
are not working, either, sir.

1308
01:37:44,956 --> 01:37:46,124
He's locked us out of the mainframe.

1309
01:37:46,249 --> 01:37:47,417
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

1310
01:37:47,542 --> 01:37:49,043
Please, please, go away. Go away.

1311
01:37:49,168 --> 01:37:50,461
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

1312
01:37:50,586 --> 01:37:51,671
Yes, I do.

1313
01:37:51,796 --> 01:37:54,215
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't be happening.

1314
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:56,676
So please, now go away. Thank you.

1315
01:37:57,093 --> 01:37:59,387
Listen, we got to get
these bitches out of here.

1316
01:37:59,637 --> 01:38:01,055
What?

1317
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,473
You tell me who's behind this.

1318
01:38:02,599 --> 01:38:07,103
- Who's behind this?
- Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1319
01:38:07,562 --> 01:38:10,106
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

1320
01:38:13,484 --> 01:38:15,111
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no!

1321
01:38:15,236 --> 01:38:16,362
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

1322
01:38:16,487 --> 01:38:18,364
- Don't call the authorities.
- Okay. Right away. Right away.

1323
01:38:18,489 --> 01:38:20,491
Step aside. Step aside.

1324
01:38:21,492 --> 01:38:23,119
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1325
01:38:30,585 --> 01:38:33,546
- How are we doing, Jarvis?
- <i>Remote reboot unsuccessful.</i>

1326
01:38:51,064 --> 01:38:52,523
This way.

1327
01:38:53,232 --> 01:38:55,026
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

1328
01:38:55,151 --> 01:38:57,362
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.

1329
01:38:57,487 --> 01:38:59,864
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- Fine. You want me to drive?

1330
01:38:59,989 --> 01:39:02,492
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1331
01:40:01,009 --> 01:40:02,635
Nice work, kid.

1332
01:40:04,429 --> 01:40:07,724
- <i>You got multiples coming in on you.</i>
- Let's get this away from the Expo.

1333
01:40:13,187 --> 01:40:15,565
When we arrive,
I need you to watch the perimeter.

1334
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:19,319
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

1335
01:40:21,613 --> 01:40:24,198
- Watch the road.
- I got it. I got it.

1336
01:40:54,646 --> 01:40:55,688
Listen, listen.

1337
01:40:55,813 --> 01:40:57,815
A pack just peeled off.
They're headed back to the Expo.

1338
01:40:57,941 --> 01:40:59,233
Got it.

1339
01:41:03,029 --> 01:41:04,489
I'm closing on you.

1340
01:41:04,614 --> 01:41:06,950
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.

1341
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,510
- Stay in the car.
- I'm not staying in the car.

1342
01:41:25,635 --> 01:41:27,136
I said, stay in the car.

1343
01:41:27,345 --> 01:41:29,305
What are you wearing?

1344
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,892
Look, I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

1345
01:41:33,017 --> 01:41:34,394
You want to help? Keep the car running.

1346
01:41:34,519 --> 01:41:35,770
Okay.

1347
01:41:39,315 --> 01:41:41,567
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.

1348
01:41:42,026 --> 01:41:43,528
Hold on. Hey!

1349
01:42:28,281 --> 01:42:30,199
Each set of drones is communicating

1350
01:42:30,325 --> 01:42:33,036
- in its own unique language.
- Well, choose one and focus on that.

1351
01:42:33,161 --> 01:42:35,121
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?

1352
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:41,127
<i>Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.</i>

1353
01:42:41,252 --> 01:42:43,504
We got it. We're on our way.

1354
01:43:24,963 --> 01:43:26,381
I got him!

1355
01:43:41,271 --> 01:43:43,273
- Rhodey, you still locked on?
- Yeah.

1356
01:43:43,398 --> 01:43:46,818
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

1357
01:43:49,028 --> 01:43:50,113
Wait, wait, wait!

1358
01:44:09,757 --> 01:44:11,134
He's gone.

1359
01:44:15,263 --> 01:44:17,265
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

1360
01:44:18,099 --> 01:44:19,892
What's your 20?

1361
01:44:31,529 --> 01:44:34,324
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1362
01:44:40,788 --> 01:44:41,789
Tony!

1363
01:44:58,348 --> 01:44:59,974
Reboot complete.

1364
01:45:00,683 --> 01:45:02,393
You got your best friend back.

1365
01:45:02,518 --> 01:45:05,855
- <i>Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.</i>
- Well done with the new chest piece.

1366
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:09,609
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

1367
01:45:09,734 --> 01:45:12,445
<i>Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1368
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:14,614
<i>What do you mean you're not dying?</i>
<i>Did you just say you're dying?</i>

1369
01:45:14,739 --> 01:45:16,449
<i>Is that you? No, I'm not.</i>

1370
01:45:16,574 --> 01:45:18,076
- <i>Not any more.</i>
- <i>What's going on?</i>

1371
01:45:18,201 --> 01:45:19,911
<i>I was going to tell you.</i>
<i>I didn't want to alarm you.</i>

1372
01:45:20,036 --> 01:45:21,496
<i>You were gonna tell me?</i>
<i>You really were dying?</i>

1373
01:45:21,621 --> 01:45:23,331
- <i>You didn't let me.</i>
- <i>Why didn't you tell me that?</i>

1374
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:26,167
<i>I was gonna make you an omelette</i>
<i>and tell you.</i>

1375
01:45:26,292 --> 01:45:29,212
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

1376
01:45:29,337 --> 01:45:30,880
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

1377
01:45:31,005 --> 01:45:32,799
- <i>Great. Pepper?</i>
- <i>Are you okay now?</i>

1378
01:45:32,924 --> 01:45:34,092
<i>I am fine. Don't be mad.</i>

1379
01:45:34,217 --> 01:45:35,760
- <i>I will formally apologise...</i>
- <i>I am mad!</i>

1380
01:45:35,885 --> 01:45:38,805
<i>... when I'm not fending off</i>
<i>a Hammeroid attack.</i>

1381
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:40,390
- <i>Fine.</i>
- <i>We could have been in Venice.</i>

1382
01:45:40,515 --> 01:45:41,557
<i>Oh, please.</i>

1383
01:45:44,811 --> 01:45:46,187
<i>Rhodes?</i>

1384
01:45:46,646 --> 01:45:49,274
<i>Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.</i>

1385
01:45:50,108 --> 01:45:52,360
<i>They're coming.</i>
<i>Come on, let's roll. Get up.</i>

1386
01:45:55,697 --> 01:45:57,782
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

1387
01:46:01,327 --> 01:46:02,620
You okay?

1388
01:46:02,829 --> 01:46:04,372
Yeah, thanks.

1389
01:46:05,957 --> 01:46:08,334
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
- Don't be.

1390
01:46:08,459 --> 01:46:09,627
No. I should have trusted you more.

1391
01:46:09,752 --> 01:46:11,296
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

1392
01:46:11,421 --> 01:46:13,715
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1393
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:17,093
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
Partner.

1394
01:46:17,385 --> 01:46:20,930
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

1395
01:46:21,598 --> 01:46:23,182
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

1396
01:46:23,308 --> 01:46:24,851
So let's put the biggest gun
up on that ridge.

1397
01:46:24,976 --> 01:46:26,227
Got you.

1398
01:46:27,103 --> 01:46:28,146
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

1399
01:46:28,271 --> 01:46:29,856
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

1400
01:46:29,981 --> 01:46:31,941
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.

1401
01:46:32,066 --> 01:46:33,401
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,

1402
01:46:33,526 --> 01:46:34,652
- all the bells and whistles.
- Yeah.

1403
01:46:34,777 --> 01:46:37,238
- It's called being a badass.
- Fine.

1404
01:46:37,989 --> 01:46:41,326
All right.
You go up top. I'll draw them in.

1405
01:46:41,451 --> 01:46:43,286
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

1406
01:46:43,411 --> 01:46:44,621
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?

1407
01:46:44,746 --> 01:46:47,624
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

1408
01:47:37,382 --> 01:47:39,133
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

1409
01:47:47,183 --> 01:47:48,393
Rhodey?

1410
01:47:49,811 --> 01:47:51,229
Get down.

1411
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:03,950
Wow. I think
you should lead with that next time.

1412
01:48:04,075 --> 01:48:07,370
Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

1413
01:48:09,831 --> 01:48:11,958
I told you that five minutes ago.

1414
01:48:13,293 --> 01:48:14,669
That's your guy here.

1415
01:48:16,045 --> 01:48:18,006
- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.

1416
01:48:18,131 --> 01:48:19,549
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

1417
01:48:19,674 --> 01:48:21,259
I'm trying to help here.

1418
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:28,933
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

1419
01:48:29,058 --> 01:48:30,602
That's good. That's good.

1420
01:48:30,727 --> 01:48:33,605
You're starting to think like a CEO,
taking out the competition.

1421
01:48:33,813 --> 01:48:36,190
I like that. You think you're making
a problem for me?

1422
01:48:36,316 --> 01:48:37,358
I'm gonna make a problem for you.

1423
01:48:37,483 --> 01:48:40,445
I'm gonna be seeing you again
real soon.

1424
01:48:44,699 --> 01:48:46,159
When they get here,
I think you should station them

1425
01:48:46,284 --> 01:48:49,078
at the south, east and both west exits.

1426
01:48:49,203 --> 01:48:51,247
We shut down the 7 train
in and out of Willets Point already.

1427
01:48:51,372 --> 01:48:54,125
Well, have city buses there
to ferry people to operating lines.

1428
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:55,710
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

1429
01:48:55,877 --> 01:48:59,297
- No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.
- Okay.

1430
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:03,551
Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.

1431
01:49:03,718 --> 01:49:05,011
This one looks different.

1432
01:49:05,511 --> 01:49:07,847
<i>The repulsor signature</i>
<i>is significantly higher.</i>

1433
01:49:18,983 --> 01:49:20,610
Good to be back.

1434
01:49:21,235 --> 01:49:22,695
This ain't gonna be good.

1435
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,284
I got something special for this guy.

1436
01:49:28,409 --> 01:49:30,495
I'm gonna bust his bunker
with the Ex-Wife.

1437
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:32,038
With the what?

1438
01:49:42,465 --> 01:49:44,926
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

1439
01:49:46,803 --> 01:49:48,346
I got this.

1440
01:50:41,316 --> 01:50:43,276
Rhodes. I got an idea.

1441
01:50:43,693 --> 01:50:46,154
- You want to be a hero?
- What?

1442
01:50:46,529 --> 01:50:49,449
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

1443
01:50:49,574 --> 01:50:51,409
- This is your idea?
- Yep.

1444
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,704
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!

1445
01:50:58,541 --> 01:50:59,584
Take it.

1446
01:51:28,196 --> 01:51:29,572
You lose.

1447
01:51:37,163 --> 01:51:39,874
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.

1448
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:41,626
Pepper?

1449
01:52:21,833 --> 01:52:23,543
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.

1450
01:52:23,668 --> 01:52:25,044
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

1451
01:52:25,169 --> 01:52:26,546
- Look at me.
- My body, literally,

1452
01:52:26,671 --> 01:52:27,880
cannot handle the stress.

1453
01:52:28,006 --> 01:52:32,468
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself
or wreck the whole company.

1454
01:52:32,594 --> 01:52:34,554
I think I did okay.

1455
01:52:34,762 --> 01:52:36,764
I quit. I'm resigning.

1456
01:52:37,432 --> 01:52:38,766
That's it.

1457
01:52:39,392 --> 01:52:41,936
What did you just say? You're done?

1458
01:52:43,271 --> 01:52:46,733
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.

1459
01:52:47,191 --> 01:52:50,445
- You don't have to make any excuses.
- I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

1460
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:51,654
You actually were just making excuses.

1461
01:52:51,779 --> 01:52:53,239
- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

1462
01:52:53,364 --> 01:52:54,657
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

1463
01:52:54,782 --> 01:52:57,076
- You deserve better.
- Well...

1464
01:52:57,201 --> 01:52:59,746
You've taken such good care of me.

1465
01:53:00,663 --> 01:53:03,041
I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so...

1466
01:53:03,166 --> 01:53:04,375
Right?

1467
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:05,710
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1468
01:53:06,544 --> 01:53:09,464
- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1469
01:53:09,589 --> 01:53:12,216
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
- Okay. What about the press?

1470
01:53:12,342 --> 01:53:14,177
Because you only had
the job for a week. That's gonna seem...

1471
01:53:14,302 --> 01:53:15,970
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1472
01:53:16,095 --> 01:53:17,430
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

1473
01:53:30,526 --> 01:53:31,736
Weird.

1474
01:53:32,028 --> 01:53:33,488
- No, it's not weird.
- It's okay, right?

1475
01:53:33,613 --> 01:53:35,490
- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.

1476
01:53:35,615 --> 01:53:37,450
I think it was weird.

1477
01:53:37,909 --> 01:53:40,828
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1478
01:53:41,412 --> 01:53:43,831
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

1479
01:53:43,957 --> 01:53:46,417
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1480
01:53:46,542 --> 01:53:49,420
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

1481
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:52,882
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

1482
01:53:53,007 --> 01:53:55,593
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

1483
01:53:55,718 --> 01:53:58,179
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

1484
01:53:58,304 --> 01:54:01,432
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

1485
01:54:01,557 --> 01:54:03,268
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1486
01:54:03,893 --> 01:54:05,103
It wasn't a question.

1487
01:54:10,733 --> 01:54:14,028
How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?

1488
01:54:33,923 --> 01:54:36,801
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1489
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:39,137
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.

1490
01:54:39,262 --> 01:54:44,475
Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1491
01:54:45,768 --> 01:54:46,811
Read it.

1492
01:54:48,771 --> 01:54:52,734
"Personality overview. Mr Stark displays
compulsive behaviour."

1493
01:54:52,859 --> 01:54:54,986
In my own defence, that was last week.

1494
01:54:57,071 --> 01:54:59,866
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

1495
01:55:00,033 --> 01:55:02,577
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

1496
01:55:02,994 --> 01:55:05,788
"Textbook narcissism"?

1497
01:55:07,874 --> 01:55:08,916
Agreed.

1498
01:55:10,043 --> 01:55:11,377
Okay, here it is.

1499
01:55:11,502 --> 01:55:14,797
"Recruitment assessment
for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1500
01:55:14,923 --> 01:55:17,425
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

1501
01:55:20,011 --> 01:55:21,512
"Tony Stark not...

1502
01:55:21,638 --> 01:55:23,139
"Not recommended"?

1503
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:25,558
That doesn't make any sense.

1504
01:55:25,683 --> 01:55:28,561
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

1505
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:30,647
I got a new ticker.

1506
01:55:30,772 --> 01:55:33,733
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

1507
01:55:34,359 --> 01:55:37,236
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1508
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:39,948
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1509
01:55:40,073 --> 01:55:43,201
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

1510
01:55:50,166 --> 01:55:52,001
You can't afford me.

1511
01:55:54,379 --> 01:55:56,589
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer

1512
01:55:56,714 --> 01:55:59,550
in exchange for a small favour.

1513
01:56:00,551 --> 01:56:05,431
Rhodey and I are being honoured
in Washington and we need a presenter.

1514
01:56:07,308 --> 01:56:08,768
I'll see what I can do.

1515
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:15,316
<i>It is my honour to be here today</i>
<i>to present these distinguished awards</i>

1516
01:56:15,441 --> 01:56:19,404
<i>to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes</i>
<i>and Mr Tony Stark,</i>

1517
01:56:19,529 --> 01:56:22,824
<i>who is, of course, a national treasure.</i>

1518
01:56:25,034 --> 01:56:26,327
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

1519
01:56:26,452 --> 01:56:28,788
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1520
01:56:29,122 --> 01:56:31,082
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

1521
01:56:32,834 --> 01:56:34,085
Mr Stark.

1522
01:56:34,210 --> 01:56:38,256
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1523
01:56:38,381 --> 01:56:40,008
You deserve this.

1524
01:56:41,509 --> 01:56:43,928
Oh, sorry.

1525
01:56:44,053 --> 01:56:47,432
Funny how annoying
a little prick can be, isn't it?

1526
01:56:48,933 --> 01:56:50,685
Let's get a photo.

1527
02:04:16,881 --> 02:04:18,800
Sir, we've found it.

1528
