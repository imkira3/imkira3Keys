1
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,770
What the hell is going on?

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,270
This amount of rain is
not normal!

3
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,970
L-Lord Koenma!

4
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,540
What is it?!

5
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,610
The river Styx is...!

6
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,130
Hurry!

7
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,260
Water has broken through
the Gate of Judgment!

8
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,560
There's a crack in the
upper part of the Gate...!

9
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,640
Take the important files!

10
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,130
W-What shall we do?

11
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,540
- Lord Koenma!
- What is it?

12
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,520
The Second and Third Levels
have been submerged!

13
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,620
If this keeps up,
all the gates will be in danger!

14
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,520
The shield has collapsed!
It cannot be repaired!

15
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,660
It is dangerous, Lord Koenma.
Please seek refuge!

16
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,200
What's the matter
with you, Lord?!

17
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,610
I don't believe it...!

18
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,210
Summon Botan!
I will be in the Great Vault!

19
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,880
But, my Lord,
now is not the time to--

20
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,580
Hurry up!

21
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,920
Lord Koenma!

22
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,330
Lord Koenma!

23
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,840
I'm here, Botan!

24
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,180
Lord Koenma!

25
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,190
Lord Koenma!

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,830
This cannot end up
in their hands!

27
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,630
Hurry and take it to Yusuke!

28
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,330
There is no other way to
save the spirit world.

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,110
- Do you understand?
- Y-Yes!

30
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,140
Go, Botan!
I must remain here.

31
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,120
Okay!

32
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,990
Go, Botan!

33
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,960
Hurry!

34
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,180
L-Lord Koenma!

35
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,810
Poltergeist Report
Bonds of Fire

36
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,300
Where did he go now?

37
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,030
Boy, I'm hungry.

38
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,800
Maybe I should just eat
my lunch now.

39
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,880
B-Botan!

40
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,220
What happened, Botan?
Talk to me!

41
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,230
What happened to you?

42
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,530
T-The spirit world is...

43
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,260
The spirit world,
the spirit world is...!

44
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,240
The spirit world is what?

45
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,280
Botan!

46
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,010
W-We must go to Kasane Shrine
and find Hinageshi.

47
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,580
What?!

48
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,350
P-Please, Yusuke.

49
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,860
Botan!

50
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,430
Keiko!

51
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,190
What happened, Botan?!

52
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,200
I don't know what's going on.

53
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,770
Botan...

54
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,870
Keiko, would you hurry and
take Botan to Genkai's temple?

55
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,810
So, what is at Kasane Shrine?

56
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,550
- I don't know.
- You don't know?!

57
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,310
You didn't find out any details?

58
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,620
There was no time for that!

59
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,890
You're not any use at all.

60
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,790
I would have found out
everything from start to--

61
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,890
Over there!

62
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,840
You bastard!

63
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,180
What do you want?

64
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,180
Get away from me!

65
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,210
Shotgun!

66
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,170
Don't worry.

67
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,500
Die!

68
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,520
Spirit Sword!

69
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,620
Oops. Didn't mean to do that...

70
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,230
- Are you all right?
- Y-Yes!

71
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,540
You two are investigators
from the spirit world, aren't you?

72
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,110
And you are...?

73
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,340
My name is Hinageshi.
I am a guide of the spirit world.

74
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,020
Botan!

75
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,160
What is this?
What could have...?!

76
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,880
How is her condition?

77
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,610
It's in the balance.

78
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,780
Something serious must have
happened to the spirit world.

79
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,490
Kurama!

80
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,070
The spirit world...was gone.

81
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,200
What?!

82
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,210
Actually, that is not accurate.
I should say it was covered by water.

83
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,290
B-But why?

84
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,220
Some immeasurably strong power
must have gained control.

85
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,850
No way...

86
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,020
What could have the
power to do that?

87
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,660
When I was there,

88
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,640
some phantoms wearing the pattern
of a cross on their foreheads...

89
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,370
were looking for something.

90
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,570
It must have been
the netherworld!

91
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,250
The netherworld...?

92
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,250
Right.

93
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,810
Those phantoms were demons
controlled by the netherworld.

94
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,580
Their symbol is that cross.

95
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,950
Hold it.
What is this "netherworld"?

96
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,330
As far as I know, there are just
the human world, the spirit world,

97
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,190
and the demon world.

98
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,730
Ah, here it is.

99
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,600
To begin with,

100
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,610
above the human world
lies the spirit world.

101
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,640
The two of them are in balance.

102
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,540
Well, humans who have died
do go to the spirit world.

103
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,580
And the netherworld
was originally...

104
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,780
above and in balance
with the demon world.

105
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,950
Then, several
thousand years ago,

106
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,150
the netherworld began a war
with the spirit world...

107
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,560
in order to gain possession
of the human world.

108
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,000
Exactly how we were able to
defeat them is unknown...

109
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,730
but Emperor Enma did finally
destroy the netherworld and...

110
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,070
banish their King Yakumo and
his men to the darkness of space.

111
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,380
So, how did the netherworld
come back into existence?

112
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,480
If the netherworld is responsible
for this disturbance...

113
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,960
it could become a very
dangerous situation.

114
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,260
We cannot repel them alone.

115
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,190
The netherworld...

116
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,820
In any case, it has
nothing to do with me.

117
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,910
Yukina is here?

118
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,580
Yukina!

119
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,250
She's with Botan.

120
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,420
Hello, Yukina!
How've you been?

121
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,530
Yukina...

122
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,860
Kazuma...

123
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,260
I'm sorry.
I'm glad to see you, but...

124
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,530
Don't.

125
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,700
But, why is Botan...?

126
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,410
An unhappy face like that
doesn't suit you, Yukina.

127
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,380
I, Kazuma Kuwahara,
shall resolve everything!

128
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,290
Soon we will all be
smiling happily again.

129
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,230
Yukina!

130
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,090
A-Are you all right?

131
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,170
Your temperature is
going up and up.

132
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
That is the power of love.

133
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,910
He is so hard to understand.

134
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,450
You're in the way, Kuwahara.

135
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,060
Yukina...

136
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,890
Why don't you tell Yukina
that you are her older brother?

137
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,400
I don't need your advice.

138
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,940
Hiei...

139
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,370
You saw the condition
of the spirit world, too.

140
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,310
This is no ordinary event.

141
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,420
How would I know?

142
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,020
What should we do, Hinageshi?

143
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,770
We have to transmit power
to the spirit world.

144
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,670
How?

145
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,930
Look.

146
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,100
There are places in the
human world called...

147
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,180
elemental sites which
naturally collect spiritual energy.

148
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,610
Elemental sites?

149
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,080
You mean storage tanks
for spiritual power?

150
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,310
Yes, something like that.

151
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,120
There are five of
these elemental sites...

152
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:04,190
representing the Earth, Wind,
Fire, Water, and the Spirit.

153
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,320
If they all are unsealed,

154
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,700
that amassed spiritual power
will be sent to the spirit world.

155
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,870
And with that power
it would be restored!

156
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,270
- Right.
- So, where are they?

157
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,240
I know where!

158
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,840
All right! Leave it to me!

159
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,870
Come, my servants!

160
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,270
Are you here?

161
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,560
Your three demon gods
have arrived, Lord Yakumo.

162
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,650
Our strategy has entered
the second stage.

163
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,350
Make the power of
the elemental sites ours.

164
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,780
- Go!
- Yes, Lord.

165
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,200
Okay, turn at this corner,
so north is behind you...

166
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,270
Where the hell is it?

167
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,380
Hold on a minute!

168
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,440
I-Is this an earthquake?

169
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,550
What's that?

170
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,740
It's...

171
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,950
It's the elemental site
representing Earth!

172
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,390
- What?!
- Let's hurry, Yusuke!

173
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,570
W-What's going on?

174
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,880
What the...?!

175
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,450
This is no good!

176
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,810
What do you mean?

177
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,380
Look at that color.

178
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,780
The elemental site has
been destroyed.

179
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,360
What is streaming out
is not spiritual power...

180
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,080
but the power
of the netherworld!

181
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,920
What?!

182
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,960
Those demons are able to convert
spiritual power to netherworld power.

183
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,870
So, that netherworld power--

184
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,560
If they steal the power from
each of the elemental sites, then...

185
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,230
Then...?

186
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,540
The spirit world will
remain inaccessible!

187
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,750
And there will be
nothing we can do!

188
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,150
- Right.
- Let's hurry!

189
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,650
They may be ahead of us.
We must protect the other sites!

190
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,930
- Okay!
- Let's split up!

191
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,630
I can't even repay Botan
the kindness I owe her.

192
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,200
Kindness?

193
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,570
I always made mistakes and
caused a lot of problems for Botan.

194
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,970
- And now I can't--
- You're wrong.

195
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,470
It's too early to give up!

196
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,870
Umm...

197
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,610
Oh, it's this way!
Up these stairs!

198
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,180
Okay.

199
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,910
Hurry up!

200
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,520
What's wrong?

201
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,620
Everything is completely different!

202
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,660
It crumbled just like that!

203
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,170
Netherworld demons.

204
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,770
They got here ahead of us again!

205
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,170
We may still make it!

206
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,350
Wait!

207
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,600
Look! That's the
elemental site of Fire!

208
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,190
What?!

209
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,270
Hold it!

210
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,040
Don't touch that!

211
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,330
It's over, Hinageshi!
What do we do now?

212
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,730
What, more?

213
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,670
Hinageshi!

214
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,680
Damn!

215
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,550
My body is... No!

216
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,520
Stop! What is this?!

217
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,690
S-Stop!

218
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,210
No. This girl is not the one.

219
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,310
Wait!

220
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,020
It seems your friend is still here.

221
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,510
Stop, you!

222
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,530
You really did it now.

223
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,300
You bastard!

224
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,470
Damn!

225
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,120
You are not a normal
human, are you?

226
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,490
You must be a tool of
the spirit world.

227
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,000
Who are you?!

228
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,300
I am Yakumo,
king of the netherworld.

229
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,740
It's Yakumo!

230
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,690
Here we go, Yakumo!

231
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,690
Spirit gun!

232
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,160
It didn't get through!

233
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,800
Your spiritual power is nothing.

234
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,800
Get out of here!

235
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,380
Yusuke! Are you okay?!

236
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,990
Yusuke!

237
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,290
Yakumo, king of the netherworld...
But why is he...?

238
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,300
D-Damn.

239
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,980
The Power Sphere...
source of our energy...

240
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,020
Plundered in the past
by the spirit world...

241
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,390
Once it has been returned,
our hopes will finally be realized.

242
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,000
The leaders of the spirit world
must have hidden it well.

243
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,100
They would not let it be
protected by such small fry.

244
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,010
Where is it?
Where did they hide it?

245
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,460
This must be the
elemental site of the Soul.

246
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,890
All right, time to open it up.

247
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,300
What's that?

248
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,150
Fools are amusing.

249
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,050
W-Who are you?

250
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,430
I am Majari, one of the three
demon gods of the netherworld.

251
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,830
I shall destroy that elemental site.

252
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,400
What did you say?
You think I'll let you do that?

253
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,070
I shall kill anyone in my way.

254
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,540
Aren't you superior?

255
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,610
Spirit sword!

256
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,680
Looks interesting.

257
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,250
Bastard!

258
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,880
Spirit sword!

259
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,950
Let me show you
what I am known for.

260
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,390
I can mirror my opponents.

261
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,230
I have copied your skills
and your ideas.

262
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,230
You have no chance at victory.

263
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,370
Say that after we've fought!

264
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,550
Bastard.

265
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,240
It's over there!

266
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,360
Don't mess with me!

267
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,310
All right.

268
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,350
I have taken your past.

269
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,260
Who is that?

270
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,630
"Who is that?"

271
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,230
I can't believe you would say
that to your old partner.

272
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,690
Kuronue...

273
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:31,700
Or do you mean to say you have
forgotten your terrible past?

274
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,080
Kurama Yoko.

275
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,380
You are still alive!

276
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,720
Try to remember that day.

277
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,320
That day we snuck into
the palace of the demon world.

278
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,380
- Don't, Kuronue!
- I need it!

279
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,370
Kuronue!

280
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,510
Traitor!

281
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,880
You deliberately cut my pendant
in order to trap me!

282
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,020
You sacrificed me so that
you alone could escape!

283
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,320
You're wrong!
That's ridiculous.

284
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,050
How dare you say that
after trying to kill me!

285
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,400
What are you talking about?
That day, I...

286
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,600
I...
To save you, I...

287
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,760
You set a trap for me. Then...

288
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,280
you left me to die
while you saved yourself.

289
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,580
Take this!

290
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,760
Wait, Kuronue!

291
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,110
It appears that we have
opened the other sites.

292
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,110
Shoot!

293
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,420
- Kuwahara!
- Wait!

294
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,720
Look at his weapon!

295
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,360
A spirit sword!

296
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,800
That demon is able to
mirror his opponent's techniques.

297
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,070
He is Majari, one of the three
demon gods of the netherworld.

298
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,940
- What...?
- You can't help!

299
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,740
If you try, he'll steal
your techniques, too!

300
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,620
Now, we finish it.

301
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,120
Kuwahara!

302
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,090
Stop joking around!

303
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,700
Even if this is the end,
I will never let you have it.

304
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,070
Here!

305
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,210
Not bad. Though I will
not be defeated either.

306
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,310
You don't have any
more tricks, do you?

307
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,720
I won't be careless again.

308
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,160
Fool!

309
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,060
I just developed a new
killing technique!

310
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,330
What?!

311
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,140
Impressive...

312
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,740
releasing your entire store
of spiritual energy at once.

313
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,750
Thank you for teaching me how.

314
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,700
Pitiful bastard.

315
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,980
I caught you!

316
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,900
Kuwahara.

317
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,850
Now you're all out of
energy, too, Majari.

318
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,420
What...?

319
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,980
I'm telling you it's useless!

320
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,730
Y-You...

321
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,320
There is something
I'm proud of too.

322
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,560
In a true contest of guts...

323
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,500
I have...

324
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,940
never been...

325
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,340
beaten!

326
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,390
I win.

327
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,960
That's it.

328
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,860
Kuwahara!

329
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,960
Hey, Kuwahara!

330
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,640
Hurry and unseal it.

331
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,140
Watch out! Jump, Yusuke!

332
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,710
Hiei!

333
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,980
The final site...!

334
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,290
With this,

335
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,350
the basis for the restoration
of the netherworld is complete.

336
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,630
Lord Yakumo...

337
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,200
Is it definite?

338
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,970
Yes. One more female
from the spirit world exists.

339
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,970
I have waited many years for this...

340
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:24,650
the moment the netherworld
will be restored on new territory.

341
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,560
W-Where are we?
Are we alive?

342
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,700
Look!

343
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,980
It appears that we were
somehow flung over here.

344
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,350
What do we do now?

345
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,050
That must be it.

346
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,000
A shield has been built around
the area the netherworld appeared in.

347
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,560
Why isn't the city in an uproar?

348
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,110
That is the power of the
netherworld.

349
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,080
Nobody is noticing things
that they normally would.

350
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,970
Where's Yusuke?

351
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,520
Keiko was going to get a
change of clothes,

352
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,350
and he said he was going
with her to check on Botan.

353
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,190
What's wrong, Hiei?

354
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,690
If no one has a good plan,
I'll take care of it myself.

355
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,390
Botan!

356
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,620
There is tremendous energy.

357
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,200
Who are you?

358
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,810
Shall I...?

359
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,140
Don't bother.

360
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,040
This is my temple!

361
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,140
How dare you enter
without permission!

362
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,320
He's strong!

363
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,790
What?! She is able to repel
Lord Yakumo's ghostly power!

364
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,910
That is it.

365
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,850
Wait!

366
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,310
S-Stay away!

367
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,910
So, it was actually true.

368
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,280
Stay away!

369
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,290
The Power Sphere is
inside this girl's body.

370
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,700
What's that?
Stay here, Keiko!

371
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,270
Yusuke!

372
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,380
Hold it!

373
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,930
You bastard!

374
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,770
You again?

375
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,400
You can't stand the
fact that I beat you.

376
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,270
Like a whipped dog.

377
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,210
What did you say?

378
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,380
Yusuke!

379
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,720
Keiko!

380
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,580
Learn your place!

381
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,220
I, Yakumo, have retrieved the
Power Sphere of the netherworld!

382
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,370
Power... Sphere...?

383
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,840
The moment of the netherworld's
restoration has arrived.

384
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,170
This is the source of our power!

385
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,010
B-Botan!

386
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,230
- Are you injured?
- I am fine.

387
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,220
Yukina...

388
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,240
Yukina!

389
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,210
She just fell asleep.

390
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,570
Damn...!

391
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:00,980
Yusuke, Keiko's
injuries are not serious.

392
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,990
Those bastards said they had found
a Power Sphere inside of Botan.

393
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:21,190
Now they have the Power Sphere,
the source of their energy--

394
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,260
Even though they have
retrieved the Power Sphere...

395
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,240
the netherworld is extinct.

396
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,100
With no place to go and
the spirit world disempowered...

397
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,680
Yakumo and his brethren
have one aim in mind.

398
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,250
Right.

399
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,870
It is to obtain their true restoration
here in the human world.

400
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,380
Botan probably knew that...

401
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,980
when Koenma entrusted her
with the Sphere.

402
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:49,720
She hid it inside her own body
so that those demons wouldn't find it.

403
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,720
She risked her own life...

404
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:56,130
knowing that its power would
overwhelm her like that.

405
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,330
And we never realized.

406
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,190
If only I had some
spiritual power remaining...

407
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,200
You left me for dead.

408
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,960
Botan...

409
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,490
You wanted me to notice.

410
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,670
If only I had been more aware...

411
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,610
I'm so sorry.

412
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,680
Keiko!

413
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,010
You are afraid of me.

414
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:23,950
Botan!

415
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,850
I shall take the
Power Sphere and this girl.

416
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:39,970
Twice... I haven't been
able to save Botan.

417
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,210
Please, Yusuke.

418
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,210
Even now,

419
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:53,750
Botan is trying to prevent them
from having their Power Sphere.

420
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,830
It's no joke!

421
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,160
You think I'll let you
get away with that?!

422
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,840
Yakumo!

423
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,180
We may have no chance, but
we cannot let it end this way!

424
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,500
The spirit world and
human world cannot be wiped out.

425
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,290
This time we will start
the attack from our side.

426
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,670
Botan, I swear I will...

427
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,180
Yusuke.

428
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,350
Let's take a different road.

429
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,760
No, it makes no difference.

430
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,430
You are correct.

431
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,440
- Kuronue!
- You know him?

432
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,450
He was a partner of mine
back when I was a thief.

433
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,520
Let me take care of it.

434
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,450
Kurama, are you still
against your old partner?

435
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,950
His old partner?
Is he okay?

436
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,430
Come, Kurama!

437
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,070
Kurama!

438
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,650
You are truly despicable.

439
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,830
In the past, you fled
and left me to die.

440
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,000
Now, you are trying to
destroy our dream.

441
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:19,680
Kuronue, it is true that I
could not rescue you that day...

442
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,350
but please believe this.
I--

443
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,240
Silence!

444
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,390
Kurama! Damn!

445
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,470
We can't do anything
in this fog.

446
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:49,040
This is his problem.
He has to resolve it himself.

447
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,980
Rose whip!

448
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,320
What's wrong?
You're not fighting back?

449
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,300
Kuronue, what you are trying
to do now is wrong.

450
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,130
You say it's wrong?
How dare you say that!

451
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:21,000
Listen to me, Kuronue!

452
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,970
Shut up!

453
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,980
You still haven't
remembered, have you?

454
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,750
Your dirty act.

455
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,190
Traitor!

456
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,450
Traitor! Traitor!

457
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:17,960
Traitor! Traitor!

458
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,070
What's that eerie noise?

459
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,090
I thought so.

460
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,160
What is it?

461
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,430
He's causing many scythes like this
to resonate and create a shield.

462
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,130
Inside it, he is able to
create evil hallucinations.

463
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,700
So, Kurama has been tricked.

464
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:12,210
Now you can make up
for your ugly past!

465
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,420
I...

466
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,480
What's wrong, Kurama?

467
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:22,490
You want to kill me to
save yourself again?

468
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,900
No, he's wrong.
That time, his pendant...

469
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,640
I will use this scythe to
cleanse your ugly soul.

470
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,110
What?

471
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,580
Stop, Kuronue!

472
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,920
Forget about me
and run, Kurama!

473
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,590
Now, the final blow!

474
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,210
Die!

475
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,380
Y-You...

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,290
The one with the ugly
rotten soul is you!

477
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,900
You are not my old
friend Kuronue!

478
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,890
Show me your true form!

479
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,870
How did you discover my trick?

480
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,040
I could tell.

481
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:53,640
First, Kuronue always
carried this with him.

482
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,580
He would never throw it away.

483
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,490
What's more,
no matter the circumstances...

484
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,320
he would never
attack an enemy from the rear.

485
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,360
Take this!

486
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,730
Kuronue risked his own life,
telling me to run away.

487
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,740
You twisted the friendship between
me and Kuronue to your advantage!

488
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,720
What's this?

489
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:58,880
So even someone like you,
who is so cool...

490
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,950
occasionally gets angry.

491
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:02,880
That's good to know.

492
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,130
Not being able to rescue
Kuronue that day--

493
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,750
Kurama.

494
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:17,890
There is no one who does not
have scars on his heart.

495
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:23,570
If there were someone like that,
he would be a shallow bastard.

496
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,080
Let's go!

497
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,020
Okay.

498
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,750
Damn! What do we do?

499
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,050
We can cross at that
flood gate!

500
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,820
What?!

501
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:24,600
All right, let's go!

502
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,670
What?!

503
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,740
W-Who is that?

504
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,840
You maggots are
persistent, aren't you?

505
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:12,280
Oh, are you planning to
fight again?

506
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,310
It seems you won't
learn till I crush you...

507
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,950
like that old lady and
little girl in the temple.

508
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,390
What?!

509
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,260
You're the bastard who
attacked Genkai and Yukina!

510
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,700
And what if I was?

511
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:32,500
Bastard!

512
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,330
I, Kazuma Kuwahara,
shall punish you!

513
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,780
What are you doing, Hiei?!

514
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,810
Leave this scum to me.

515
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,720
You have no chance
without your spiritual power!

516
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,390
I will not let you live!

517
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,390
What the...?

518
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:10,830
You cannot treat me
like the others, Hiei.

519
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,140
You are no match for
my Evil Eye!

520
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,080
What...?

521
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:29,090
That's Raiko, another of the three
demon gods of the netherworld.

522
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,960
What type of creature is he?

523
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,130
A very powerful one.

524
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,220
He is a demon who can
draw out wickedness...

525
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,300
from his opponent's soul and
manipulate it with his Evil Eye.

526
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,930
Draw out wickedness...?

527
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,010
Hiei is going to become evil!

528
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,350
Take this, hell-scum!

529
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,500
Damn.

530
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:19,270
Let your eyes open to the evil
which dwells in your soul!

531
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,840
What...?

532
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:25,970
Awaken the evil which sleeps
in the depths of your heart!

533
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:44,190
- W-What's that?!
- No, Hiei!

534
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,500
If he looks into that
evil abyss for too long...

535
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,940
he will be pulled into
their evil world.

536
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,780
Evil Eyes!

537
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:05,420
That is correct.
Now the eyes will open...

538
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,120
and you shall
despise your friends.

539
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:14,190
Your true character is
an incarnation of evil!

540
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,960
Go after them!

541
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:23,440
Your power is now
at its maximum.

542
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,070
Smash them!

543
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:30,610
Hiei! Stop!

544
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,970
He's preparing for the
Black Dragon Wave!

545
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,900
We're doomed if he uses it!

546
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,240
You cannot attack us, Hiei!

547
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,220
Now! Fire, Hiei!

548
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:29,400
Hiei, you bastard,
showing us your true evil character!

549
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,870
Hiei!

550
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,850
Don't underestimate me!

551
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,620
What?!

552
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:57,930
You bastard!

553
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:37,600
Part of the shield has...!

554
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,010
A path has been opened!

555
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,710
Hiei!

556
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:50,050
Those Evil Eyes could not
seduce my Black Dragon.

557
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:52,150
W-What's going on?

558
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,350
Hiei wasn't tricked at all.

559
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,870
Hiei!

560
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:06,270
Using the Black Dragon Wave
against those Evil Eyes has...

561
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:08,700
exhausted all his energy.

562
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,430
Are you okay?

563
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:14,140
Don't worry about me.
There is no time. Hurry!

564
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,140
Okay!

565
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,870
- Let's go!
- Okay!

566
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:30,920
Boy, you sure are
a troublemaker.

567
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,790
- Here we go.
- Kuwahara!

568
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,560
We all have to see the
conclusion. Let's go!

569
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,450
That's it!

570
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,590
Let's go.

571
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:49,400
So, Raiko and the others
are dead.

572
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,480
It doesn't matter.

573
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,620
If the Power Sphere of
the netherworld is returned...

574
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,150
we will make the
human world our own.

575
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,650
Our years of pain shall
finally end.

576
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,220
Now you shall return the
Netherworld Power Sphere to me.

577
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,800
Even unconscious,

578
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,570
you are using your
final bit of energy to resist.

579
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,140
It is useless!

580
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,680
I am the only one who can
handle the Power Sphere!

581
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:33,180
You will only suffer with it.

582
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,430
Botan!

583
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,800
- Wait!
- Leave!

584
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:04,710
This is it!

585
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,680
What?

586
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:11,750
I will never give it to you!

587
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:14,280
Botan!

588
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,890
It is useless!

589
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,230
Let go, woman!

590
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,160
Botan!

591
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,910
Botan!

592
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,840
I'm sorry, Hinageshi.

593
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,910
Involving you in this
dangerous situation...

594
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,740
Don't be ridiculous!

595
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:41,840
I should have realized sooner.

596
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,720
I'm sorry.

597
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,090
T-Thank you.

598
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:51,750
I knew that
you would find out.

599
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,200
Botan!

600
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,400
Y-Yusuke.

601
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:05,770
I couldn't protect...

602
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,810
the Power Sphere.

603
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:11,040
Get it back.

604
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,610
Botan! Botan!

605
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,190
Here I go.

606
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,480
I won't let you die, Botan!

607
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,020
I won't let you do
whatever you want!

608
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,130
The origin of the
netherworld's strength,

609
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:35,200
the Power Sphere
has returned.

610
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,140
Now I shall restore our world.

611
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,800
I shall become god and
master of this place!

612
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:46,570
Humans seem to be
quite stupid creatures.

613
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,910
Do you think
you can match me?

614
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:54,580
We don't necessarily attack
because we think we can win.

615
01:09:54,680 --> 01:10:00,050
Then is the great aim of protecting
the world for a sense of justice?

616
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,620
That is wrong, too!

617
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,060
What incomprehensible creatures.

618
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,070
W-What is this?

619
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:17,930
What's going on...?

620
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,200
- Hurry!
- Okay.

621
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:32,820
Botan! Hinageshi!

622
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:40,090
I am going to create my own world.
What is wrong with that?

623
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:46,200
Why are you doing it
in the human world?

624
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,600
You are the ones who called me.

625
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:51,170
What?!

626
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:54,110
You said, "Please visit."

627
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,580
It is true...

628
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:01,640
that my world was beaten
in a battle with the spirit world...

629
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:05,210
and was sealed in
the darkness of outer space.

630
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:09,050
I waited patiently for
an opportunity.

631
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:13,160
And I collected the evil
power of those humans...

632
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,560
who were sent into space
by the spirit world.

633
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:20,230
I gathered enough power
to destroy the seal.

634
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,770
I seem to get along just fine
with that evil human power...

635
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,700
which the spirit world
could not handle.

636
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,540
Damn.

637
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:37,520
Our souls set him loose!

638
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,390
What happened?

639
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:44,980
Now I shall let you taste the power
of human beings' wicked hearts!

640
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,590
- He's just playing around!
- It's no match!

641
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,570
D-Damn!

642
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,410
Yusuke!

643
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:42,170
You should not waste your
remaining bit of spiritual energy.

644
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:47,860
He's fast!

645
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,590
Hurry and get behind the pole!

646
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:57,530
Botan.

647
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,720
Spirit gun!

648
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:53,080
What happened?

649
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,180
This is my world.

650
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:58,330
I said everything is
according to my thoughts.

651
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,400
You cannot harm me.

652
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:04,960
You are a fool, harming
yourself with your own power.

653
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:09,530
Have you wasted your
remaining bit of spiritual power?

654
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,010
This is no good!

655
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:17,880
I'll make this the end!

656
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:26,150
Kuwahara!

657
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,520
What?!

658
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:39,690
You fool. Yusuke
isn't your only opponent.

659
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,600
Did you forget
that I'm still here?!

660
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:03,750
What can you, a human being
without spiritual energy, do?

661
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,360
Kuwahara!
I'm the one fighting!

662
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,740
S-Stop! I'm...

663
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,220
You rest there!
I'll finish him off now.

664
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:33,020
Are you protecting each other?

665
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,090
What's so funny?

666
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,690
The reason you are weak...

667
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:42,060
is because you are stuck
believing in that facile friendship.

668
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,800
Shut up!

669
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,260
Don't you know
the meaning of fear?

670
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:54,940
Your body should be feeling
the disparity in our power.

671
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,830
The time has come to change the
human world into the netherworld!

672
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,820
Damn! What's happening?

673
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:45,290
Die! I shall blow away
you and your world!

674
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,390
Return the Power Sphere
of the Netherworld!

675
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:58,210
Give it back!

676
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:02,510
You can't keep that thing
which Botan almost died to...!

677
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,610
Hinageshi!

678
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:21,900
Hinageshi!

679
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,440
Don't mess with me!

680
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:39,240
Stop! You'll die!

681
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,660
Hiei! Kurama!

682
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:58,360
Yu... Yusuke... What happened
to the Power Sphere?

683
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,630
I have no more spiritual power.

684
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,970
But in there...

685
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,610
What's wrong, boy?

686
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,390
You are certainly strong...

687
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:22,890
and we may simply not
be a match for you.

688
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,000
But...

689
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:34,360
But, if I did nothing...

690
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:41,230
I could not forgive myself!

691
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,580
It is useless.

692
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,150
Even Emperor Enma
of the spirit world...

693
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:56,120
could not handle the Netherworld
Power Sphere and had to seal it up.

694
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:58,590
I am the only one who
can manage it.

695
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,470
Yusuke.

696
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,970
Yusuke!

697
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,870
Yusuke...

698
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:35,190
Now, into my hands the
sphere of the netherworld--

699
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,400
What? Impossible!

700
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:53,180
Yusuke!

701
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,660
Yusuke is burning
his soul into pure power.

702
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:38,050
Kuwahara!

703
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:44,220
Let me help you, Yusuke.
I have too much spiritual power.

704
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:54,600
Do it, Yusuke!

705
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:56,270
I can't wait.

706
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,570
Kurama, Hiei, let's go!

707
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,950
It can't be!

708
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:07,490
Does he really have the strength to
change the netherworld's power...

709
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,920
into spiritual energy?

710
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:21,800
The feelings of all four
have become one.

711
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,810
Take this!

712
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:12,950
Go!

713
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,820
Did we do it?

714
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:33,840
It's over.

715
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:36,940
It has finally been settled.

716
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:39,870
Where are Hinageshi
and Botan?

717
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,610
Let's find them!

718
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:51,820
Hinageshi!

719
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,240
Guys!

720
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:51,640
This is my final blow!

721
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:57,910
Take this! Spirit gun!

722
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:53,190
Botan!

723
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:56,670
Hang in there, Botan!

724
01:26:57,570 --> 01:26:59,230
Botan!

725
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,040
Koenma.

726
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,710
Is it you, Koenma!

727
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,870
A-Are we still alive?

728
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,920
Has the spirit world
been restored?!

729
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,870
Yusuke.

730
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,100
- It's finally over.
- Yeah, somehow.

731
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:40,800
Did that bastard really die?

732
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:44,900
I don't know.
He could be hiding among us.

733
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,250
That's not even funny!

734
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:51,310
But if he is, we'll give him
another good beating!
