2
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,237
This is Mr Mathison.
He's a doctor.

3
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:14,951
- Are you okay?
- An ambulance is on the way.

4
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,036
Thank you.

5
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,253
Is there a name yet?

6
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,506
Elijah.

7
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,055
Is he supposed
to be crying like this?

8
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,141
May I?

9
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,575
Can I have him back?

10
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,457
What happened during the delivery?

11
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,210
Nothing.
It was very quick.

12
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,462
The baby just wanted
to come right out.

13
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,547
And there were no problems.

14
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:14,010
Did you drop him?

15
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,095
What?

16
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,306
Did you drop this baby?

17
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,391
Jesus Christ, no.

18
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:28,566
Inform the ambulance
that we have a situation.

19
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,611
All right.
Molly.

20
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:34,531
I've never seen this.

21
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:41,371
It appears that your baby
has sustained some fractures...

22
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:43,456
while inside your uterus.

23
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,003
His arms and his legs are broken.

24
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,306
<i>This is Eastrail 177.</i>

25
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,516
<i>Next stop, Philadelphia.</i>

26
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,469
Are you alone?

27
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,223
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,479
Someone left this magazine.

29
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,565
Want to take a look at it?

30
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:15,650
Could I take a look at that one?

31
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,908
Thanks.

32
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:26,911
- You like sports?
- It's my field.

33
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,997
I represent athletes.
I'm an agent.

34
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:34,294
Are you looking for any
male synchronized swimmers?

35
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:37,172
- I'm thinking about getting into that.
- Is that right?

36
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:42,594
I'm afraid of water.

37
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,679
Think that's a problem?

38
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:55,106
You represent someone
in Philadelphia?

39
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,442
I'm meeting this player
from Temple University.

40
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,527
He's a cornerback.

41
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:03,364
This kid is 6'1 ", 210 pounds.

42
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:07,619
He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.

43
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,705
Do you like football?

44
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,790
Not really.

45
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:27,764
- I'm David Dunn.
- Kelly.

46
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:30,600
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

47
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,685
Nice-Nice to meet you.

48
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,862
How long are you gonna be
in Philadelphia?

49
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:54,123
- I'm married.
- Great.

50
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,043
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

51
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:02,090
I-

52
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:06,469
I think you misunderstood
what I was, uh...

53
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,721
- s-saying-
- I know.

54
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,643
I think I'm gonna find another seat.

55
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:16,187
I- I didn't mean, uh-

56
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:59,123
<i>That's what he failed to realize.
I look classy, not trashy.</i>

57
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:04,045
<i>I look classy too. What about me?
Don't I look classy?</i>

58
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,548
<i>But I'm afraid you forgot this!</i>

59
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:10,802
<i>- And this! And-
- Where has you been, Banana?</i>

60
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,137
<i>Now I've got you, weasel.</i>

61
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:17,934
<i>Some cars are still on fire,
and the debris is everywhere.</i>

62
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,936
<i>We are not sure at this time, uh...</i>

63
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,522
<i>how rescue personnel will be able
to get on scene at all.</i>

64
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:25,191
<i>If you'rejust tuning in,
Eastrail train number 177...</i>

65
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,694
<i>has derailed
just outside Philadelphia.</i>

66
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,113
<i>And we're bringing you
live coverage from Skycam 4.</i>

67
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,532
<i>Yes, that is- It appears
to be a rescue ambulance...</i>

68
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,535
<i>and there are more behind it
I can see on the access road.</i>

69
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,121
<i>I don't know how close they're
gonna be able to get, David.</i>

70
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:40,999
<i>These are woods and, uh, trees.</i>

71
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,501
<i>It's gonna be a very
difficult rescue effort.</i>

72
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:01,603
Try to hack some of that off.

73
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,203
Hi. I'm Dr Dubin.

74
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:21,998
You're in the emergency room in
the Philadelphia City Hospital.

75
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,083
You were in a serious accident.

76
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,504
Look at me.

77
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,589
How are you feeling?

78
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,676
- Okay.
- Good.

79
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,221
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

80
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:40,099
Have you ever had any heart
or asthma problems in the past?

81
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:44,354
- No.
- Kidney or renal problems?

82
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,940
- No.
- Any allergies?

83
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:51,319
No.

84
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,117
Where were you sitting
on the train?

85
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:04,958
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?

86
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,212
Yeah.

87
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:15,176
- Where are the other passengers?
- Was your family travelling with you?

88
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:19,764
No.

89
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:22,559
Did you get up from your seat?

90
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:31,234
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?

91
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,491
Yes.

92
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,877
Why are you looking at me like that?

93
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,004
Your train derailed.

94
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,840
Some kind of malfunction.

95
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:56,885
They only found
two people alive so far-

96
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,970
you and this man.

97
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:04,684
His skull was cracked open and
most of his left side was crushed.

98
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:08,980
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons...

99
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:12,108
why I'm looking at you like this.

100
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,986
One, because it seems
in a few minutes...

101
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:19,365
that you will officially be
the only survivor of this train wreck.

102
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,368
And two...

103
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,454
because you didn't break one bone.

104
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,874
You don't have a scratch on you.

105
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,899
David?

106
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:22,488
What happened in New York?

107
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:26,701
I don't think I got the job.

108
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:31,706
I'm still going to, uh-

109
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,542
I'm still moving there.

110
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,628
Just-

111
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:39,756
Uh, just-just not now.

112
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,930
Good night.

113
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,060
Good night.

114
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,074
Sara Elaston...

115
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:09,327
social worker at
Broad and Locust Community Centre.

116
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,747
We pray for your soul.

117
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,044
Kevin Elliot, businessman...

118
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,005
father of six.

119
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:23,091
We pray for your soul.

120
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,845
Glen Stevens...

121
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:30,223
researcher in the area
of leukemia...

122
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,308
at Drexel University.

123
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:36,104
We pray for your soul.

124
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:40,066
Jennifer Pennyman...

125
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,320
third-grade teacher
at Jefferson Elementary.

126
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,533
We pray for your soul.

127
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,770
- Yes?
- Is Noel in, ma'am?

128
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,855
No, sir, he is not.

129
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:05,109
I read about you in the paper.

130
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:08,446
- What?
- I was in an accident once too.

131
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,533
A horse almost trampled me to death.

132
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:13,618
- Wow.
- Had him put down.

133
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,289
That's a sad story.

134
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:26,089
Could- Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?

135
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:28,341
Proceed.

136
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:30,468
Would you ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken...

137
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:32,679
since I've worked here?

138
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:35,640
- That the entire message?
- Yes, ma'am.

139
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,563
Thank you.

140
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,603
Hey, Noel.

141
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,938
What, you hit your head on that train?

142
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:26,024
Get your brain
to start working again?

143
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,278
- What?
- Forty dollars.

144
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:34,616
- Forty dollars what?
- You're gettin' a $40-a-week raise.

145
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,701
That's it.

146
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:41,039
I checked. You were right.
You've never taken a sick day.

147
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:44,834
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.

148
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:46,878
Smart way to make your point.

149
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:16,199
- Is Joseph okay?
- Yeah.

150
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:18,827
- He's asleep.
- Oh.

151
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,959
I wanted to ask you a question.

152
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:28,253
It's gonna sound a little strange,
but, uh...

153
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:31,297
just think about it
for a second, okay?

154
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:34,092
Okay.

155
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:36,344
When's the last time I was sick?

156
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:38,429
Do you remember?

157
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:43,977
Um, I-I don't know.

158
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,857
It's been a while.

159
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,735
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.

160
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:54,946
Okay.

161
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,031
Do you remember me gettin' sick?

162
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:02,495
Um...

163
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:04,873
not a specific day.

164
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:07,167
And what's-what's this about?

165
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,006
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?

166
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:15,967
In the three years
we lived in this house?

167
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,136
In the old apartment?

168
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:21,181
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?

169
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:27,520
I- I can't remember.

170
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:31,733
Don't you think
that's kind of weird...

171
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:35,987
not remembering one cold
or a-a fever or a sore throat?

172
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:40,283
What do you think it means?

173
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:47,957
Um...

174
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,920
I think it means
I'm probably too tired to remember.

175
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:37,715
No more sittin' in this room.
I let it go on long enough.

176
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,969
I'm not goin' out there any more.
I'm not getting hurt again.

177
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:45,390
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.

178
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:47,809
You might fall between
this chair and that television.

179
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:50,895
If that's what God has planned for you,
that's what's gonna happen.

180
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:53,398
You can't hide from it
sittin' in a room.

181
00:21:57,443 --> 00:22:01,281
They call me Mr Glass at school
because I break like glass.

182
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:08,413
You make this decision now...

183
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:11,833
to be afraid...

184
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:15,628
and you will never turn back.

185
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:22,177
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.

186
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:39,527
- I got a present for you.
- Why?

187
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:43,239
Forget why.

188
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:47,827
You want it or not?

189
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:52,999
Well, go get it, then.

190
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:56,044
Where is it?

191
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,755
On a bench...

192
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:00,840
across the street.

193
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,898
Someone's gonna take it.

194
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,653
Then you better get out there soon.

195
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:38,104
I bought a whole bunch.

196
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,694
There'll be one of these
waitin' for you...

197
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,946
every time you want
to come out here.

198
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,789
They say this one
has a surprise ending.

199
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:08,718
This is from Fritz Campion's
own library.

200
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:13,723
This is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1968.

201
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:17,852
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.

202
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:21,940
Notice the square jaw of Slayer,
common in most comic heroes.

203
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:25,777
And the slightly disproportionate size
of Jaguaro's head to his body.

204
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,948
This again is common,
but only in villains.

205
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:32,450
The thing to notice about this piece...

206
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:36,538
the thing that makes it
very, very special...

207
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:39,707
is its realistic depiction
of its figures.

208
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,835
When the characters
reached the magazine...

209
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:44,003
they were exaggerated...

210
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:46,339
as always happens.

211
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:50,176
This is vintage.

212
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:55,056
Well...

213
00:26:00,144 --> 00:26:02,647
wrap it up.

214
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,149
You've made a considerably
wise decision.

215
00:26:10,572 --> 00:26:12,574
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.

216
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,163
Once again, please?

217
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:21,040
My son Jeb-
it's a gift for him.

218
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:24,002
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.

219
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:29,090
No.

220
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:32,927
No, no, no, no, no.

221
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:36,806
You need to go. Now.

222
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,727
What'd-What'd I say?

223
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,147
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?

224
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,274
Do you see a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt...

225
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:48,526
with my name printed on it?

226
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,529
Did you see a little Asian child with
a blank expression sitting outside...

227
00:26:51,613 --> 00:26:55,366
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?

228
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,078
No? Well, that's what
you see at a toy store...

229
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:01,164
and you must think
you're in a toy store because...

230
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:04,792
you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

231
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:07,879
Now, one of us
has made a gross error...

232
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:11,174
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.

233
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:13,384
This is an art gallery,
my friend...

234
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:17,222
and this is a piece of art.

235
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,572
We're by appointment only.

236
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,952
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations.

237
00:27:39,035 --> 00:27:42,664
You have a mailbox.
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.

238
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:45,583
This one was under
the windshield wiper of my car.

239
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:51,548
How certain are you that
you've never taken ill?

240
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:54,175
Seventy-five percent.

241
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:57,720
Well, that's not
certain at all, is it?

242
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:02,058
That's hole number one.

243
00:28:02,141 --> 00:28:05,353
I'm going to be extremely skeptical
about all this.

244
00:28:05,436 --> 00:28:07,438
About all what?

245
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,151
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?

246
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:14,237
Dad's been injured.

247
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,533
Is the child correct?

248
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:22,745
Yes, sir. In college,
I was in a car accident.

249
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:27,709
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football any more.

250
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,794
That's hole number two.

251
00:28:31,588 --> 00:28:33,590
That's a big one.

252
00:28:37,177 --> 00:28:41,139
Mr Price, can we talk about
the note that you left on my car?

253
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:44,475
I've studied the form
of comics intimately.

254
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,603
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed...

255
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:49,856
with nothing else to do but read.

256
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:51,941
I believe comics
are our last link...

257
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:55,737
to an ancient way
of passing on history.

258
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,989
The Egyptians drew on walls.

259
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:02,327
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.

260
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,579
I believe comics
are a form of history...

261
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:08,249
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.

262
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,668
Then, of course,
those experiences and that history...

263
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:13,796
got chewed up in the commercial
machine, got jazzed up...

264
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,758
made titillating,
cartooned for the sale rack.

265
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:21,554
This city has seen its share
of disasters.

266
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:24,140
I watched the aftermath
of that plane crash.

267
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:26,768
I watched the carnage
of the hotel fire.

268
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:31,773
I watched the news waiting to hear
a very specific combination of words...

269
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:34,359
but they never came.

270
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:38,196
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident...

271
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,323
and I heard them.

272
00:29:40,406 --> 00:29:42,492
"There is a sole survivor...

273
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:45,703
and he is miraculously unharmed. "

274
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:52,168
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.

275
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:54,254
It's a genetic disorder.

276
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:56,339
I don't make a particular
protein very well...

277
00:29:56,422 --> 00:29:58,967
and it makes my bones
very low in density.

278
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,344
Very easy to break.

279
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:03,972
I've had 54 breaks in my life...

280
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:08,852
and I have the tamest version
of this disorder, type one.

281
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:12,647
There are type two,
type three, type four.

282
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,732
Type fours don't last very long.

283
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,362
So that's how it popped into my head.

284
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:22,282
If there is someone
like me in the world...

285
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:24,617
and I'm at one end
of the spectrum...

286
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:26,744
couldn't there be someone else...

287
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:29,080
the opposite of me
at the other end?

288
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:33,543
Someone who doesn't get sick, who
doesn't get hurt like the rest of us?

289
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:37,422
And he probably
doesn't even know it.

290
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:42,719
The kind of person
these stories are about.

291
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:47,932
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.

292
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:50,101
To guard us.

293
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,108
- You think my dad's a real-
- I don't think anything right now.

294
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:59,652
It's a possibility-

295
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,738
one with many holes.

296
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:07,952
Joseph, don't take
another sip of that water.

297
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:13,208
- Go throw it in the trash.
- But Dad-

298
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,293
Do it now, please.

299
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,556
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.

300
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,143
You find someone you want
to take advantage of...

301
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:35,688
you tell them a fantastic story...

302
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:38,650
and somewhere in there you say it:

303
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,694
"I just need
your credit card number...

304
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:43,780
a small down payment. "

305
00:31:46,449 --> 00:31:48,451
This morning was the first morning
that I could remember...

306
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:50,537
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...

307
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:55,500
sadness.

308
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:02,257
I thought the person that wrote
that note had an answer for me.

309
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,225
I'm gonna leave now.

310
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:14,310
Good luck with your exhibition.

311
00:32:14,394 --> 00:32:16,896
So, what kind of job
do you have, David?

312
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,023
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.

313
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:23,695
- What exactly is it that you do?
- I work at the University Stadium.

314
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,364
I'm a security guard.

315
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,252
Hi.

316
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:47,172
I've come to a decision.

317
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:49,632
Okay.

318
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:52,260
I just wanna ask you something, okay?

319
00:34:52,343 --> 00:34:55,889
And you can be totally honest.

320
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:59,601
I'm prepared for any answer,
and-and it won't affect me.

321
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,981
Have you been with anyone?

322
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:07,317
I mean, since we've
been having problems.

323
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,402
The answer won't affect me.

324
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:15,283
I just need to know, you know?

325
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:17,368
I mean, it won't affect me
either way.

326
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:21,789
No.

327
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:31,925
Sorry, David.
I'm sorry.

328
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,390
Anyway...

329
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:41,476
my decision is...

330
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:46,731
that I want to start again.

331
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,112
And I want it to be
like it was in the beginning.

332
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,828
And it's a big deal that
you walked away from that train.

333
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:04,833
I feel like it's a second chance.

334
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:14,300
And if you feel like
asking me out sometime...

335
00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:16,386
that'd be okay.

336
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:20,849
Okay.

337
00:36:33,528 --> 00:36:36,072
<i>- Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.</i>

338
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:40,451
<i>Yeah, it's Jenkins. Look, we got a guy
over at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket.</i>

339
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:44,581
<i>Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.</i>

340
00:36:44,664 --> 00:36:47,375
What's he look like?

341
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,669
Why is it, do you think, that
of all the professions in the world...

342
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:51,754
you chose protection?

343
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,634
- You are a very strange man.
- You could have been a tax accountant.

344
00:36:56,718 --> 00:36:59,596
You could have owned your own gym. You
could've opened a chain of restaurants.

345
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,098
You could've done
one of 10,000 things.

346
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:06,311
But in the end,
you chose to protect people.

347
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:08,897
You made that decision,
and I find that...

348
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,982
very, very interesting.

349
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:15,195
Now all I need is
your credit card number.

350
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,323
That last part was a joke.

351
00:37:22,494 --> 00:37:26,998
- You're a big sports fan, are you?
- It's starting to intrigue me.

352
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:30,710
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.

353
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:45,391
Programme here.
Programme.

354
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:47,477
Programme.

355
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,066
Programme. Programme here.

356
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:55,151
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.

357
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:57,237
- Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?

358
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,322
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to search you.

359
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:02,784
- It's nothing personal.
- The tall guy in the camouflage jacket.

360
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:07,413
Sometimes people carry weapons in here,
and they drink too much.

361
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:12,168
If the team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.

362
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:15,505
We do pat-downs of the crowd
to discourage people from carrying.

363
00:38:16,923 --> 00:38:19,551
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.

364
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:34,691
Yeah, step right up here.

365
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:48,621
Okay. I got you a seat up
in the yellow section.

366
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:53,543
It's in the nosebleeds,
but at least you won't get spit on.

367
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:55,879
- All right.
- How'd you know that guy you bumped...

368
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:57,964
was carrying a weapon?

369
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:02,343
I don't know.

370
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:06,848
Maybe it was that camouflage
army jacket he was wearing.

371
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:09,684
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.

372
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:13,146
You thought he was carrying a knife?

373
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:16,316
- I thought he was carrying something, yeah.
- But not a knife.

374
00:39:19,944 --> 00:39:24,908
I got a picture of a silver gun
with a black grip...

375
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:27,243
tucked in his pants.

376
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:29,704
You know, like on TV.

377
00:39:31,164 --> 00:39:34,000
You have good instincts
for things like that?

378
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:37,504
- Like what?
- Knowing when people have done something wrong?

379
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:44,135
- Yeah.
- Have you ever tried to develop it?

380
00:39:46,095 --> 00:39:50,183
- I don't know what you're asking me.
- Your skill.

381
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:52,435
Look, I gotta be down on
the sidelines during the game.

382
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:54,771
- You can get to your seat right down-
- Characters in comics...

383
00:39:54,854 --> 00:39:57,357
are often attributed special powers-

384
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,903
invisibility, X-ray vision,
things of that sort.

385
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:04,572
Okay.

386
00:40:04,656 --> 00:40:09,285
- I don't wanna play this game any more.
- It's an exaggeration of the truth.

387
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:14,582
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.

388
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:17,293
- But he might not have been carrying anything.
- But he might have been carrying...

389
00:40:17,377 --> 00:40:20,255
a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in his pants.

390
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:23,174
<i>- Dunn.
- I gotta go.</i>

391
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:27,846
Yeah, I know.
I'll be right down.

392
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:31,140
- One last question.
- What?

393
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:33,601
That car accident you were in.

394
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:35,687
Was there anyone else involved?

395
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:41,234
Yeah.
My wife, Audrey.

396
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:43,403
She was in the car with me.

397
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:48,408
Have a good life, Elijah.

398
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:51,870
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.

399
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:55,999
<i>- Dunn.
- I'm on my way.</i>

400
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:02,297
<i>...into the investigation
of train 177...</i>

401
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,550
<i>being conducted at the Eastrail
holding warehouses.</i>

402
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:08,178
<i>The city council has
stepped up plans to pass a bill...</i>

403
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:11,598
<i>requiring higher standards
for inspection and maintenance...</i>

404
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:14,350
<i>of all rail transportation
for Philadelphia...</i>

405
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:16,436
<i>and its outlying districts.</i>

406
00:41:24,194 --> 00:41:25,862
Hold up a second!

407
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,503
I just want to ask you something.

408
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,909
Dad! Hey, Dad!

409
00:43:42,832 --> 00:43:44,834
Dad!

410
00:43:55,887 --> 00:43:59,641
Joseph, do you know how mad your mother would
be if she knew you were playing football?

411
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:02,560
Are you gonna tell?

412
00:44:02,644 --> 00:44:06,105
You wanna play last of the downs?
We got a big guy like you.

413
00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:10,318
You could play on opposite sides.
He's Potter's cousin.

414
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:12,946
He's starting cornerback
at Temple University.

415
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:15,114
He's going pro in the draft.

416
00:44:15,198 --> 00:44:18,660
They say he can run the 40
in 4.3 seconds.

417
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:20,662
Yeah, I've heard.

418
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,747
You can beat him, Dad.

419
00:44:22,831 --> 00:44:25,291
- Let's beat him.
- I'm gonna go in.

420
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:28,002
Just play one set of downs.
I told them you were great.

421
00:44:28,086 --> 00:44:30,088
- Why'd you do that?
- Just one.

422
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:32,298
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.

423
00:44:32,382 --> 00:44:35,176
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.

424
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,886
- I'll help you.
- No, I-I don't need-

425
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:40,765
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!

426
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:43,852
Go, go.
Here we go! Ready?

427
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:47,146
Hut! You're doing good.
Right there! Catch!

428
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,524
<i>I've gOt tO run</i>

429
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:52,193
<i>To keep from hiding</i>

430
00:44:52,277 --> 00:44:54,612
<i>And I'm bound</i>

431
00:44:54,696 --> 00:44:57,198
<i>To keep on riding</i>

432
00:44:57,282 --> 00:45:01,911
<i>And I've got one more silver dollar</i>

433
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:04,122
How much did you put on there?

434
00:45:13,006 --> 00:45:16,801
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.

435
00:45:16,885 --> 00:45:20,680
How much can you lift?

436
00:45:20,763 --> 00:45:22,807
That's the most I ever lifted.

437
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,104
That could've been dangerous,Joseph.

438
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:30,565
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me finish up, okay?

439
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:33,443
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.

440
00:45:37,906 --> 00:45:41,576
You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

441
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:43,495
No.

442
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:46,080
I mean, if you knew karate.

443
00:45:46,164 --> 00:45:48,166
No.

444
00:45:52,212 --> 00:45:55,340
Well, what if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?

445
00:45:55,423 --> 00:45:57,425
No,Joseph.

446
00:46:38,758 --> 00:46:41,469
How much did you take off?

447
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:45,890
I lied.

448
00:46:48,434 --> 00:46:50,436
You added?

449
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,321
How much is it?

450
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:03,783
270 pounds.

451
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:09,330
Let's put more.

452
00:47:12,584 --> 00:47:14,043
Okay.

453
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:20,967
Why don't you move back a little
just to be safe, okay?

454
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,752
More?

455
00:48:07,013 --> 00:48:10,850
You should never do anything like this.
You know that, right?

456
00:48:12,644 --> 00:48:15,146
What do you do
if something bad happens?

457
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,732
Get Mom.

458
00:48:17,816 --> 00:48:19,692
Right.

459
00:48:54,894 --> 00:48:57,689
How much did you put on that time?

460
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:03,486
All of it.

461
00:49:05,238 --> 00:49:07,240
What else can we use?

462
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,852
How much is it?

463
00:49:44,777 --> 00:49:46,779
How much is it, Dad?

464
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:52,285
About 350 pounds.

465
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:01,461
Fracture of the fifth metacarpal
of the right hand...

466
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:04,923
as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.

467
00:50:05,006 --> 00:50:07,550
The worst of the injury, however,
was sustained to the right leg...

468
00:50:07,634 --> 00:50:09,636
in the form of a spiral fracture.

469
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:11,721
There were 14 breaks.

470
00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:14,682
It simply shattered.

471
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:17,352
They call me Mr Glass.

472
00:50:17,435 --> 00:50:21,147
- Who does?
- Kids.

473
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:23,316
Are you all right, Mr Price?

474
00:50:23,399 --> 00:50:25,401
Shall I continue?

475
00:50:26,736 --> 00:50:29,113
Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg.

476
00:50:29,197 --> 00:50:31,950
The use of a wheelchair will be needed
for a two-month period.

477
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:35,453
The use of crutches will follow
for 12 to 14 months.

478
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:37,705
Hospital stay will range
from five to eight days...

479
00:50:37,789 --> 00:50:40,625
followed by nine to twelve months
of physical therapy.

480
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:43,419
Prescribed medication for pain
management will take the usual forms...

481
00:50:43,503 --> 00:50:46,297
of morphine drip, percocet, darvocet.

482
00:50:57,809 --> 00:50:59,894
Your, uh, 10:00 is here.

483
00:50:59,978 --> 00:51:02,105
The hospital discharged him
this morning.

484
00:51:04,315 --> 00:51:06,317
Thanks.

485
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,202
Elijah, right?

486
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:20,123
We're gonna prevent any substantial
atrophy of your good leg with this...

487
00:51:20,206 --> 00:51:22,458
and it works your quadriceps.

488
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:25,795
How long have you been married?

489
00:51:28,506 --> 00:51:31,467
- Twelve years.
- How'd you get together?

490
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,722
I'm a little nervous being here.

491
00:51:35,805 --> 00:51:39,267
I ask too many questions
when I'm nervous.

492
00:51:41,352 --> 00:51:43,354
A car accident.

493
00:51:43,438 --> 00:51:47,192
Oh. And now you're gonna
have to tell me more.

494
00:51:51,571 --> 00:51:54,073
My husband was a star athlete
in college...

495
00:51:54,157 --> 00:51:56,201
and we were in
an accident together.

496
00:51:57,827 --> 00:52:01,873
Our car flipped on an icy road and we were both
injured, and he couldn't play football any more.

497
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:04,751
And if that hadn't happened,
we probably wouldn't have been together.

498
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:08,546
- How so?
- I think we should talk about your rehab.

499
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,965
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

500
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:15,595
So, tell me more
about the quad machine.

501
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,849
It prevents atrophy by-

502
00:52:21,601 --> 00:52:23,812
I couldn't spend my life
with someone who played football.

503
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:25,897
It's pretty much that simple.

504
00:52:27,065 --> 00:52:30,276
I mean, I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount of skill it involves.

505
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,154
And-And like everyone else,
I was in awe of the way he played it.

506
00:52:33,238 --> 00:52:37,492
But football, in many ways,
is the opposite of what I do.

507
00:52:38,743 --> 00:52:41,246
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.

508
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:44,791
You know, it's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.

509
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:49,754
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but-

510
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,924
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident...

511
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:55,260
and took football out of the equation.

512
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:58,263
And everyone lived happily ever after.

513
00:53:00,306 --> 00:53:01,933
Sort of.

514
00:53:02,016 --> 00:53:04,686
What part of David's body was injured?

515
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:09,399
Who said my husband's name was David?

516
00:53:17,157 --> 00:53:19,159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen-</i>

517
00:53:30,879 --> 00:53:32,881
<i>In the first half-</i>

518
00:54:02,035 --> 00:54:04,579
A 737 crashes on takeoff-

519
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:07,624
172 die, no survivors.

520
00:54:07,707 --> 00:54:12,086
A hotel fire downtown-
211 die, no survivors.

521
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:16,132
An Eastrail train derails
71/2 miles outside the city-

522
00:54:16,216 --> 00:54:18,218
131 die...

523
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:20,386
one survivor.

524
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,764
He is unharmed.

525
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:25,767
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.

526
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,686
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.

527
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,940
Since then, I've come to believe
that possibility...

528
00:54:32,023 --> 00:54:34,025
however unbelievable...

529
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:36,569
is now more a probability.

530
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:39,531
And what was it you suggested?

531
00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:42,325
These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn.

532
00:54:42,408 --> 00:54:45,995
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe...

533
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,124
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.

534
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:53,336
I hope you can keep an open mind.

535
00:55:35,336 --> 00:55:37,922
Excuse me, sir?

536
00:55:38,006 --> 00:55:40,425
Can you step out of line, please?

537
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:48,516
We've been having some problems with
people selling drugs here in the stadium.

538
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,060
Would you mind if I check your pockets?

539
00:55:52,187 --> 00:55:54,898
Raise your arms, please.

540
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:56,983
Come on, raise them up.

541
00:55:57,066 --> 00:55:59,277
I just got here, man.

542
00:56:09,871 --> 00:56:11,915
Can I put my hands down now?

543
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,672
Can I go?

544
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:22,800
Yeah.

545
00:56:24,344 --> 00:56:26,346
Hope you find them.

546
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:39,901
<i>- YO, Dunn.
- Yeah.</i>

547
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:43,029
<i>I just came into the office.
Your kid was hurt.</i>

548
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,492
<i>- Where is he?
- Some play rehearsal at school.</i>

549
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:49,828
<i>He wants you to come down there.</i>

550
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,803
Is that your dad?

551
00:57:10,014 --> 00:57:13,184
I bet my dad could beat up your dad.

552
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:19,816
No, he, uh, he insisted
we call only you...

553
00:57:19,899 --> 00:57:21,985
though we had some trouble
tracking you down.

554
00:57:22,068 --> 00:57:24,112
I mean, you're not on our list.

555
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:26,990
Audrey handles this type of stuff.

556
00:57:27,073 --> 00:57:29,784
Oh. What type of stuff?

557
00:57:31,244 --> 00:57:33,246
Joseph stuff.

558
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:38,751
Do I need to put any smelly ointment
on him or anything?

559
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:40,837
No, no, it's more emotional damage.

560
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,465
Not, uh- Not to serious, physically.

561
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:48,052
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

562
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:54,225
When was that?

563
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:58,938
My office was on the other side
of the building back then.

564
00:58:01,399 --> 00:58:04,068
You don't remember me, do you?

565
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:10,158
- No, ma'am.
- I had red hair.

566
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:17,165
Well, you were a little younger
than Joseph when it happened.

567
00:58:17,248 --> 00:58:20,835
Did you know that we
changed the rules of conduct...

568
00:58:20,919 --> 00:58:23,713
around the pool because of you?

569
00:58:26,132 --> 00:58:28,134
The kids still tell about it...

570
00:58:28,218 --> 00:58:31,679
like it was some sort of ghost story.

571
00:58:31,763 --> 00:58:36,059
"Did you know there was a kid
nearly drowned in that pool?

572
00:58:37,352 --> 00:58:40,730
He lay on the bottom of the pool
for five minutes.

573
00:58:40,814 --> 00:58:45,026
And when they pulled him out,
he was dead. "

574
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:53,701
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.

575
00:58:57,288 --> 00:58:59,833
You still phobic of water?

576
00:59:02,836 --> 00:59:04,879
It was Potter and another guy.

577
00:59:06,214 --> 00:59:10,176
They were messing with
this Chinese girl in the dressing room.

578
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,596
Y- You can't let bad things
happen to good people, right?

579
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:18,226
That's your code, right?
That's the hero's code.

580
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:21,729
I tried to make them stop...

581
00:59:21,813 --> 00:59:25,900
but they kept pushing me down,
and they wouldn't let me get back up.

582
00:59:28,695 --> 00:59:31,531
I thought maybe 'cause you're my dad...

583
00:59:32,657 --> 00:59:34,993
I thought I might be like you.

584
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,582
I'm not like you.

585
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:45,670
You are like me.

586
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:47,964
We can both get hurt.

587
00:59:49,299 --> 00:59:53,511
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.

588
00:59:53,595 --> 00:59:56,431
Why do you keep saying that?

589
01:00:04,147 --> 01:00:07,442
Elijah Price came to visit me
at the centre today.

590
01:00:08,568 --> 01:00:11,446
Jesus.

591
01:00:11,529 --> 01:00:14,282
He didn't do anything. He just...

592
01:00:14,365 --> 01:00:16,367
told me his theory.

593
01:00:17,494 --> 01:00:20,163
That's sad when patients get like that.

594
01:00:20,246 --> 01:00:22,248
They lose reality.

595
01:00:27,212 --> 01:00:29,756
Joseph, what the hell are you doing?

596
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,841
Oh, my God.

597
01:00:31,925 --> 01:00:35,720
You don't believe. I'll show you.
You can't get hurt.

598
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:38,723
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't
know where I keep the bullets.

599
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:41,851
In your Rookie of the Year trophy.

600
01:00:41,935 --> 01:00:44,729
Joseph, did you load the gun?

601
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:48,483
- You won't get hurt.
- Elijah was wrong.

602
01:00:48,566 --> 01:00:51,069
- When did he meet Elijah?
- He was with me when I met him.

603
01:00:51,152 --> 01:00:53,154
No one believes him.

604
01:00:53,238 --> 01:00:56,199
Joseph, listen to me.

605
01:00:56,282 --> 01:01:01,412
Sometimes when people get sick or hurt
for a long time, like Elijah...

606
01:01:01,496 --> 01:01:05,375
their mind gets hurt too, and they
start to think things that aren't true.

607
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:09,254
He told me what he thought
about your father. It isn't true.

608
01:01:09,337 --> 01:01:11,339
I'll show you.

609
01:01:13,967 --> 01:01:18,012
Do you remember the story about the
- about the boy that almost drowned in the pool?

610
01:01:18,096 --> 01:01:20,765
That was me they were talking about.
I almost died. That was me.

611
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:23,643
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying, okay? I just didn't remember it, that's all.

612
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:25,895
Joseph, you know your father
was injured in college.

613
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:28,815
You know that.
You know all about that.

614
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:32,485
Don't do it.
He'll die,Joseph.

615
01:01:32,569 --> 01:01:37,073
- I'll just shoot him once.
- Joseph, listen to what your moth-

616
01:01:37,157 --> 01:01:39,159
Don't be scared.

617
01:01:40,368 --> 01:01:42,370
Joseph...

618
01:01:42,453 --> 01:01:44,998
if you pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.

619
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:48,459
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.

620
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:52,046
Y- Y-You're right.
If you pull that trigger...

621
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:55,383
that bullet is just gonna bounce off me,
and I'm not going to be hurt.

622
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:57,802
But then I'm going to go upstairs
and I'm gonna pack...

623
01:01:57,886 --> 01:02:01,097
and I'm going to leave for New York.

624
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:06,102
- Why?
- Because I thought we were just starting to be friends for real.

625
01:02:06,186 --> 01:02:08,188
And friends'll listen to each other.
They don't-

626
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:12,108
And-And they don't shoot each other,
uh, uh, do they, Audrey?

627
01:02:12,192 --> 01:02:15,236
N- No shooting friends,Joseph.

628
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,780
Joseph!

629
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:20,992
You are about to be in big trouble!

630
01:02:22,118 --> 01:02:24,120
Now, I am your father,
and I am telling you...

631
01:02:24,204 --> 01:02:27,415
to put that goddamn gun down
right now!

632
01:02:27,499 --> 01:02:30,335
One, two-

633
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,689
I followed the guy
in the camouflage jacket.

634
01:02:53,608 --> 01:02:59,030
He had a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in the back of his pants.

635
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:04,077
Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?

636
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,664
'Cause I believe you faked it.
I believe you took the opportunity...

637
01:03:07,747 --> 01:03:10,500
to end your football career,
no questions asked.

638
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:14,337
And I think you did it,
of all things, for a woman.

639
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,422
I guess that makes sense.

640
01:03:16,506 --> 01:03:19,759
Football's what, just ten years?

641
01:03:19,843 --> 01:03:24,430
But love?
Hmm. Now, that's forever.

642
01:03:26,766 --> 01:03:29,978
And that little bit of sadness
in the mornings you spoke of?

643
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:32,313
I think I know what that is.

644
01:03:32,397 --> 01:03:35,900
Perhaps you're not doing
what you're supposed to be doing.

645
01:03:35,984 --> 01:03:37,986
Most guns have a black
or silver handle.

646
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:40,071
I had a 50-50 shot
of getting the colour right.

647
01:03:40,155 --> 01:03:43,283
- That's not what I witnessed.
- Stop.

648
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:46,661
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.

649
01:03:46,744 --> 01:03:50,331
My son almost shot me last night because
he wanted to prove you were right.

650
01:03:50,415 --> 01:03:52,417
I never said you couldn't be killed.

651
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,502
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.

652
01:03:54,586 --> 01:03:59,424
There have been three major disasters,
and you were the only one unharmed.

653
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:01,509
I have been sick.

654
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,433
When I was a kid, I spent a week in the
hospital getting better from pneumonia.

655
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:12,270
I almost drowned.
Two skinny little kids...

656
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:15,857
were fooling around in a pool dunking me
and I swallowed some water.

657
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:19,068
They didn't know it,
and it almost killed me.

658
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:21,738
Heroes don't get killed like that.

659
01:04:21,821 --> 01:04:24,073
Normal people do, right?

660
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:28,578
I don't need to see you any more, okay?

661
01:04:30,163 --> 01:04:32,665
Please stay away from my family.

662
01:04:41,341 --> 01:04:44,469
<i>She said I could tell stories
that could make you cry</i>

663
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:46,596
<i>What about you</i>

664
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:48,890
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.

665
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:50,975
I gotta head.

666
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:55,271
<i>And she sighed, ahh
I said, I want to be a singer</i>

667
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:58,775
You better not be jacking off to the
Japanese comics, I swear to God.

668
01:05:00,652 --> 01:05:03,780
<i>Let's go, let's sit
Let's talk politics</i>

669
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:06,783
<i>Goes so good with beer
And while we're at it, baby</i>

670
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:09,369
<i>Why don't you tell me
one of your biggest fears</i>

671
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:12,580
<i>I said, losing my penis
to a whore with disease</i>

672
01:05:12,664 --> 01:05:14,791
Uh, look, man, I didn't
know you were in a-

673
01:05:14,874 --> 01:05:17,085
<i>Losin'my life to
a whore with disease</i>

674
01:05:17,168 --> 01:05:20,129
<i>- Just choose something, all right?
- Excuse me, please</i>

675
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:27,053
The baby-sitter's here.

676
01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:33,143
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fine.

677
01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:38,940
We can do this another time.

678
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:41,025
Don't lie.

679
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:45,738
I'm fine. I just got mixed up.

680
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:55,748
How about we just go
for a couple drinks?

681
01:06:01,421 --> 01:06:04,174
Okay, look, man,
I'm-I'm just gonna wheel you out.

682
01:06:04,257 --> 01:06:06,259
All right? You can think about things
outside on the sidewalk.

683
01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:08,344
I gotta get some chicken in me,
you know what I'm sayin'?

684
01:06:08,428 --> 01:06:11,598
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired</i>

685
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:16,603
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired</i>

686
01:06:25,445 --> 01:06:28,740
<i>- I told the tale of a girl
- Shit!</i>

687
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:31,075
<i>She's a little bit older than me</i>

688
01:06:31,159 --> 01:06:33,912
<i>Strong legs, strong face
voice like milk</i>

689
01:06:33,995 --> 01:06:35,997
<i>Breasts like a cluster of grapes</i>

690
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,374
<i>I can't escape her ways</i>

691
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:40,460
<i>She raise me</i>

692
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:48,760
<i>- Dude.
- Even if you have no one</i>

693
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:50,887
Man, I don't care if you are in
a wheelchair. If you do that again...

694
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,515
I'm calling 5-0.

695
01:06:53,598 --> 01:06:55,683
<i>And while you're at it, baby</i>

696
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:57,769
Man.

697
01:07:03,316 --> 01:07:07,946
<i>You don't want to sleep
after setting my loins on fire</i>

698
01:07:08,029 --> 01:07:11,407
That's it, crackerjack. You're gonna
be sitting your ass in jail now.

699
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:16,204
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired</i>

700
01:07:16,287 --> 01:07:19,833
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired</i>

701
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:32,720
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired</i>

702
01:07:32,804 --> 01:07:35,974
<i>- I've been tired, I've been tired
- How much for this one?</i>

703
01:07:36,057 --> 01:07:37,559
<i>I've been tired</i>

704
01:07:39,018 --> 01:07:42,397
- Rust?
- Yeah.

705
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,816
As a colour, not as rust.

706
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:48,820
You know, like rust-coloured
paint or wood.

707
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:53,908
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

708
01:07:53,992 --> 01:07:56,578
Mine's still brown.

709
01:07:56,661 --> 01:07:58,663
Okay, my turn.

710
01:07:58,746 --> 01:08:00,957
Favourite song?

711
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:05,211
"Soft and Wet" by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.

712
01:08:05,295 --> 01:08:07,630
What?

713
01:08:07,714 --> 01:08:10,466
We're supposed to be honest.

714
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,969
"Soft And Wet. "

715
01:08:13,052 --> 01:08:15,388
That's very interesting.

716
01:08:15,472 --> 01:08:17,474
Okay, my turn.

717
01:08:19,184 --> 01:08:21,394
When was the first time...

718
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:25,773
the thought popped into your head
we might not make it?

719
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:29,277
That's not the game.

720
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,405
It's the first date.
There aren't any rules.

721
01:08:36,576 --> 01:08:40,121
- Don't know for sure.
- Think carefully.

722
01:08:41,414 --> 01:08:43,416
What about the game?

723
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,502
It's over. I won.

724
01:08:47,504 --> 01:08:49,506
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specific moment.

725
01:08:49,589 --> 01:08:54,344
- Maybe it was a time-
- I had a nightmare one night...

726
01:08:54,427 --> 01:09:00,266
and I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was okay.

727
01:09:01,768 --> 01:09:04,145
I think that was the first time.

728
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:08,191
Does that count?

729
01:09:09,734 --> 01:09:11,736
That counts.

730
01:09:15,448 --> 01:09:19,327
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?

731
01:09:27,043 --> 01:09:29,462
Yes.

732
01:09:29,546 --> 01:09:31,548
Why?

733
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:35,718
I don't know.

734
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,809
I just don't feel right, Audrey.

735
01:09:44,227 --> 01:09:46,604
Something's...

736
01:09:46,688 --> 01:09:48,898
just not right.

737
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:54,195
Do you resent us, David?

738
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:56,781
Resent the life you have?

739
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:02,328
I mean, there were a lot of other things
you could've done after college.

740
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:04,789
These were your choices.

741
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,754
You know, even if it meant
we couldn't have been together...

742
01:10:11,838 --> 01:10:15,300
I never would've wished
that injury on you.

743
01:10:15,383 --> 01:10:17,844
What you could do physically...

744
01:10:17,927 --> 01:10:20,180
was a gift.

745
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:23,057
I never would've wished it to go away.

746
01:10:25,268 --> 01:10:27,270
You know that, right?

747
01:10:31,483 --> 01:10:34,319
You had two calls after Joseph
went to bed. One came through...

748
01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:36,696
while I was on the other line,
but I wasn't talking too long.

749
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:40,617
There was an emergency with my sister. She tried to do
her own perm, and now she looks like she stuck her head-

750
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,827
Who called through?

751
01:10:42,911 --> 01:10:45,330
Um, someone from New York...

752
01:10:45,413 --> 01:10:47,457
uh, about a security job.

753
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,752
They want to hire you. I didn't know
you guys were moving to New York.

754
01:10:50,835 --> 01:10:53,254
Thanks for telling me.

755
01:10:53,338 --> 01:10:55,924
We weren't all gonna move.

756
01:10:57,091 --> 01:10:59,093
Oh.

757
01:11:01,012 --> 01:11:04,349
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

758
01:11:08,478 --> 01:11:10,480
Great.

759
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:25,787
Look, let's just be honest here.
We're just at the beginning...

760
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:28,873
and I don't expect
you or I to change...

761
01:11:28,957 --> 01:11:31,417
the course of where
our lives were headed...

762
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:33,795
because of one date.

763
01:11:33,878 --> 01:11:38,341
And if you do go to New York,
we can develop this.

764
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:41,594
We'll just be forced to take it slow.

765
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:45,431
And in the end, I think
that's definitely better.

766
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:50,270
I mean, this is our second time around,
David. I didn't expect us...

767
01:11:50,353 --> 01:11:52,647
to get carried away.

768
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:58,778
But I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.

769
01:12:23,553 --> 01:12:25,805
<i>David, it's Elijah.</i>

770
01:12:25,889 --> 01:12:27,891
<i>It was so obvious.</i>

771
01:12:27,974 --> 01:12:30,310
<i>It was this one issue
that brought it back for me-</i>

772
01:12:30,393 --> 01:12:32,395
<i>Century Comics 117.</i>

773
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:34,606
<i>That's where this group,
the Coalition of Evil...</i>

774
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:37,192
<i>tried to ascertain the weakness
of every superhero...</i>

775
01:12:37,275 --> 01:12:40,695
<i>because they all have one,
just like you.</i>

776
01:12:40,778 --> 01:12:44,824
<i>Your bones don't break.
Mine do. That's clear.</i>

777
01:12:44,908 --> 01:12:48,369
<i>Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine.</i>

778
01:12:48,453 --> 01:12:52,415
<i>You don't get sick.
I do. That's also clear.</i>

779
01:12:52,499 --> 01:12:57,795
<i>But for some reason, you and I
react the exact same way to water.</i>

780
01:12:57,879 --> 01:13:00,298
<i>We swallow it too fast, we choke.</i>

781
01:13:00,381 --> 01:13:02,634
<i>We get some in our lungs, we drown.</i>

782
01:13:02,717 --> 01:13:07,806
<i>However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I.</i>

783
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:12,560
<i>We're on the same curve,
just on opposite ends.</i>

784
01:13:12,644 --> 01:13:16,689
<i>The point of all this is we
now know something we didn't.</i>

785
01:13:16,773 --> 01:13:20,318
<i>You have a weakness- water.</i>

786
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:23,363
<i>It's like your kryptonite.</i>

787
01:13:23,446 --> 01:13:25,740
<i>You hearing me, David?</i>

788
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,710
Audrey?

789
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:18,538
Gotcha. Come on.

790
01:16:36,139 --> 01:16:38,975
Audrey. Audrey.

791
01:16:44,856 --> 01:16:46,858
Hey!

792
01:16:50,945 --> 01:16:53,823
You'll be okay.

793
01:16:53,907 --> 01:16:57,702
What- What happened?

794
01:16:57,785 --> 01:17:01,706
I thought I was-
I thought I was dead.

795
01:17:01,789 --> 01:17:03,791
Me too.

796
01:17:08,254 --> 01:17:10,256
Is she all right?

797
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,675
I think her leg's broken.

798
01:17:12,759 --> 01:17:15,303
Are you hurt?

799
01:17:15,386 --> 01:17:17,597
Hey, man, are you hurt?

800
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:50,046
Hello.

801
01:17:50,129 --> 01:17:52,882
<i>I wasn't injured in that car accident.</i>

802
01:17:52,966 --> 01:17:55,593
David.

803
01:17:55,677 --> 01:17:58,221
<i>I've never been injured, Elijah.</i>

804
01:18:00,557 --> 01:18:02,851
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

805
01:18:08,815 --> 01:18:11,693
Go to where people are.

806
01:18:11,776 --> 01:18:14,779
You won't have to look very long.

807
01:18:16,406 --> 01:18:19,367
It's all right to be afraid, David...

808
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:23,496
because this part won't be
like a comic book.

809
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:28,459
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes
that were drawn for it.

810
01:19:06,789 --> 01:19:10,752
There's one in the first row.
It's- It's the second one.

811
01:19:10,835 --> 01:19:13,713
Yes. It's the second one over.

812
01:19:46,871 --> 01:19:49,040
Go back to Africa!

813
01:20:05,348 --> 01:20:07,600
Hey, what's your name?

814
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:15,441
I think you drank too much.

815
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:03,114
Can I come in?

816
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:05,742
Who are you?

817
01:21:05,825 --> 01:21:08,620
I like your house.

818
01:21:08,703 --> 01:21:10,705
Can I come in?

819
01:21:10,788 --> 01:21:12,999
What is this?

820
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:17,962
No, you can't come in.

821
01:21:18,046 --> 01:21:20,507
Are you sure?

822
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:22,884
What are- What are you-

823
01:25:53,071 --> 01:25:55,073
It's okay.

824
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:07,418
It's okay. It's okay.

825
01:32:51,114 --> 01:32:53,700
I had a bad dream.

826
01:32:59,581 --> 01:33:01,749
It's over now.

827
01:33:29,736 --> 01:33:32,572
I don't know.

828
01:33:32,655 --> 01:33:34,741
I can't believe you'd think that.

829
01:33:34,824 --> 01:33:36,826
I'm just asking you.

830
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:42,290
I'm making French toast.

831
01:33:57,722 --> 01:34:00,308
I've been thinking about Elijah Price.

832
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:05,396
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, okay?

833
01:34:09,484 --> 01:34:11,486
Okay?

834
01:34:13,988 --> 01:34:15,990
Okay.

835
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,186
You were right.

836
01:36:15,777 --> 01:36:19,864
This is one of Johann Davis'
earliest drawings.

837
01:36:19,948 --> 01:36:22,325
See the villain's eyes?

838
01:36:22,408 --> 01:36:24,661
They're larger than
the other characters'.

839
01:36:24,744 --> 01:36:30,250
They insinuate a slightly skewed
perspective on how they see the world-

840
01:36:31,376 --> 01:36:33,670
just off normal.

841
01:36:33,753 --> 01:36:36,089
He doesn't look scary.

842
01:36:36,172 --> 01:36:38,675
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son.

843
01:36:38,758 --> 01:36:41,427
But he says there's always two kinds.

844
01:36:41,511 --> 01:36:45,932
There's the soldier villain
who fights the hero with his hands...

845
01:36:46,015 --> 01:36:50,311
and then there's the real threat-
the brilliant and evil archenemy...

846
01:36:50,395 --> 01:36:52,897
who fights the hero with his mind.

847
01:36:52,981 --> 01:36:54,983
Are you Elijah's mother?

848
01:36:55,066 --> 01:36:58,820
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

849
01:36:58,903 --> 01:37:01,698
Nice to meet you. I'm David Dunn.

850
01:37:01,781 --> 01:37:03,783
He's spoken of you.

851
01:37:03,867 --> 01:37:05,869
Says you're becoming friends.

852
01:37:05,952 --> 01:37:08,371
We are.

853
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:10,665
Looks like he's doing good today.

854
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:14,711
I'm very proud of him.

855
01:37:14,794 --> 01:37:17,881
He's come through a lot in his life-

856
01:37:17,964 --> 01:37:21,509
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.

857
01:37:21,593 --> 01:37:24,721
Mm-hmm. They were bad...

858
01:37:25,847 --> 01:37:28,391
but he made it.

859
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:30,477
Yes, he did.

860
01:37:31,603 --> 01:37:33,813
He's kind of a miracle.

861
01:37:35,982 --> 01:37:37,984
Yes, he is.

862
01:37:41,529 --> 01:37:44,199
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

863
01:37:45,533 --> 01:37:49,287
We'll work something out.
Always able to work something out.

864
01:38:14,354 --> 01:38:16,356
It has begun.

865
01:38:19,484 --> 01:38:21,611
Tell me something, David.

866
01:38:22,737 --> 01:38:27,283
When you woke up this morning,
was it still there?

867
01:38:27,367 --> 01:38:30,245
The sadness?

868
01:38:30,328 --> 01:38:32,330
No.

869
01:38:35,917 --> 01:38:38,962
I think this is where we shake hands.

870
01:38:57,981 --> 01:39:01,025
- Look!
- Did you see it?

871
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:12,912
I worked in that building 25 years.

872
01:39:12,996 --> 01:39:15,123
I know all its secrets.

873
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:18,585
Secrets?

874
01:39:20,003 --> 01:39:24,924
Like if there ever was a fire
on floors one, two or three...

875
01:39:25,008 --> 01:39:28,511
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.

876
01:39:34,476 --> 01:39:37,228
Passengers aren't allowed in there.

877
01:40:20,522 --> 01:40:22,982
Do you know what
the scariest thing is?

878
01:40:26,694 --> 01:40:29,989
To not know your place
in this world...

879
01:40:30,073 --> 01:40:32,617
to not know why you're here.

880
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:35,912
That's-

881
01:40:37,747 --> 01:40:40,166
That's just an awful feeling.

882
01:40:41,543 --> 01:40:43,878
What have you done?

883
01:40:45,046 --> 01:40:48,091
I almost gave up hope.

884
01:40:48,174 --> 01:40:51,386
There were so many times
I questioned myself.

885
01:40:51,469 --> 01:40:54,013
You killed all those people.

886
01:40:55,306 --> 01:40:58,143
But I found you.

887
01:40:58,226 --> 01:41:01,521
So many sacrifices...

888
01:41:02,647 --> 01:41:04,649
just to find you.

889
01:41:04,732 --> 01:41:06,734
Jesus Christ!

890
01:41:16,619 --> 01:41:19,414
Now that we know who you are...

891
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:23,251
I know who I am.

892
01:41:26,838 --> 01:41:29,048
I'm not a mistake.

893
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:32,719
It all makes sense.

894
01:41:32,802 --> 01:41:37,390
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?

895
01:41:37,474 --> 01:41:40,852
He's the exact opposite of the hero.

896
01:41:40,935 --> 01:41:44,689
And most times, they're friends,
like you and me.

897
01:41:44,772 --> 01:41:48,610
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?

898
01:41:48,693 --> 01:41:50,695
Because of the kids.

899
01:42:00,622 --> 01:42:03,291
They called me Mr Glass.
