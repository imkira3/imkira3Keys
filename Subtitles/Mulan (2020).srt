3
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,610
<i>There have been many tales</i>

4
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,530
<i>of the great warrior, Mulan.</i>

5
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,870
<i>But, ancestors,
this one is mine.</i>

6
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,580
Here she is.

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,210
<i>A young shoot, all green...</i>

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,250
<i>unaware of the blade.</i>

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,260
<i>If you had such a daughter...</i>

10
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,390
<i>her chi, the boundless energy
of life itself...</i>

11
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,180
<i>speaking through
her every motion...</i>

12
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,390
<i>could you tell her that
only a son could wield chi?</i>

13
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,690
That a daughter would risk
shame, dishonor, exile?

14
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,700
Ancestors, I could not.

15
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,390
This way.

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,810
That's the last one.

17
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
Gently.

18
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,980
Mulan! Forget the chicken!

19
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,190
It will come back!

20
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,240
No!

21
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,870
<i>Tell me your sister
is not the cause of this.</i>

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,170
Mulan!

23
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,210
<i>Take control of yourself!</i>

24
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,410
<i>Mulan!
Listen very carefully.</i>

25
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,870
No!

26
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,410
Mulan, what happened
when you fell off the roof?

27
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,330
It was like you were a bird.

28
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,990
Don't panic.

29
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,290
There's a spider
crawling in your hair.

30
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,710
You know I'm afraid of spiders.

31
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,460
This is not one of
your tricks, is it, Mulan?

32
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,050
<i>Don't worry,
if you hold very still...</i>

33
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,340
<i>I will squash it.</i>

34
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,050
<i>It is because I'm trying
to protect Mulan</i>

35
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,140
<i>that I say this.</i>

36
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
Mulan is young.

37
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,350
She is still learning
how to control herself.

38
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,060
You make excuses for her.

39
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,730
You forget, Mulan is
a daughter, not a son.

40
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,980
<i>A daughter brings honor
through marriage.</i>

41
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,530
<i>Any man would be fortunate to
marry either of our daughters.</i>

42
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,820
<i>Including Mulan.</i>

43
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,870
<i>I ask you, what man will want
to marry a girl</i>

44
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,080
<i>who flits around rooftops,
chasing chickens?</i>

45
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,540
Xiu gives me no trouble.

46
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,380
The matchmaker will find
a good husband for her.

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,590
It is Mulan I worry about.

48
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,930
They'll call her a witch.

49
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,390
It's time you talked to her.

50
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,680
<i>Do you know why the phoenix</i>

51
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,670
<i>sits at the entrance
of our shrine?</i>

52
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,720
She is the emissary
for our ancestors.

53
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,340
But I broke her.

54
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,140
<i>Some say the phoenix
is consumed by flame...</i>

55
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,390
<i>and emerges again.</i>

56
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,060
I think she can survive
a broken wing.

57
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,150
Your chi is strong, Mulan.

58
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,240
<i>But chi is for warriors...</i>

59
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,490
<i>not daughters.</i>

60
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,540
<i>Soon,
you'll be a young woman...</i>

61
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,580
<i>and it is time for you...</i>

62
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,750
<i>to hide your gift away.</i>

63
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,790
<i>To...</i>

64
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,340
<i>To silence its voice.</i>

65
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,640
I say this to protect you.

66
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,220
That is my job.

67
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,850
Your job is to bring honor
to the family.

68
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,230
Do you think you can do that?

69
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,470
Rourans? It can't be.

70
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,510
<i>Close the gates!</i>

71
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
Take out the leader!

72
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,240
<i>He's way too strong!</i>

73
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,790
You. You'll do.

74
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,320
<i>Your Majesty...</i>

75
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,320
<i>six of our northern garrisons
along the Silk Road...</i>

76
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,820
<i>have fallen
in a coordinated attack.</i>

77
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,370
<i>All trade has been disrupted.</i>

78
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,240
<i>If we allow this to continue,</i>

79
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,370
<i>it could be
the end of the kingdom.</i>

80
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,960
<i>And my citizens?</i>

81
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,750
Slaughtered.

82
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,710
This soldier
is the only survivor.

83
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,170
I fear more attacks will follow.

84
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,510
Who is responsible?

85
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,060
<i>Rourans, Your Majesty.</i>

86
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,440
<i>Their leader calls himself
Böri Khan.</i>

87
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,060
<i>I killed Böri Khan.</i>

88
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,270
It is his son.

89
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,230
<i>He has united the tribes</i>

90
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,190
<i>and resurrected the Rouran army.</i>

91
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,860
If I may,
Your Imperial Majesty.

92
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,580
<i>You may speak.</i>

93
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,120
<i>Böri Khan
fights alongside a woman.</i>

94
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,460
<i>Her chi is beyond imagining.</i>

95
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,960
<i>There is no place
for witches in this kingdom.</i>

96
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,840
<i>It is forbidden
to use the power of chi</i>

97
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,380
<i>in destructive ways.</i>

98
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,930
<i>And yet, it is her skill</i>

99
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,010
<i>that leads the Rouran army
to victory.</i>

100
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,970
<i>She has trained an elite force
of shadow warriors</i>

101
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,350
<i>to assist Böri Khan.</i>

102
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,640
We're not afraid
of dark magic.

103
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,150
We'll destroy this Rouran army
and their witch.

104
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,650
Here's my decree.

105
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,900
We'll build a mighty army.

106
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,990
Every family
will supply one man.

107
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,290
<i>We'll protect
our beloved people...</i>

108
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,660
<i>and crush these murderers.</i>

109
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,170
Deploy the Imperial Army.

110
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,510
The dynasty
will not be threatened.

111
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,090
So, you have news.

112
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,010
<i>The emperor sends his army</i>

113
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,510
<i>to defend the Silk Road.</i>

114
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,590
Good.

115
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,180
<i>We will crush every garrison</i>

116
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,680
<i>until the Imperial Army
is on its knees.</i>

117
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,680
<i>And then...</i>

118
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,730
<i>the Imperial City
will be laid bare.</i>

119
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,820
The emperor
will be mine to kill.

120
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,440
You have proved useful, witch.

121
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,030
Not witch.

122
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,990
Warrior.

123
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,160
I could tear you to pieces
before you blink.

124
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,750
But you won't.

125
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,380
<i>Remember what you want...</i>

126
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,590
<i>a place where your powers
will not be vilified.</i>

127
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,800
A place where you are accepted
for who you are.

128
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,390
You won't get what you want
without me.

129
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,190
<i>When I found you
on a desert steppe</i>

130
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,770
<i>wandering alone...</i>

131
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,400
<i>you were exiled.</i>

132
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,360
A scorned dog.

133
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,780
When I sit on the throne,
that dog will have a home.

134
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,240
We will finish what we started.

135
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,830
<i>And you will see to it</i>

136
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,170
<i>that nothing and no one
stands in my way.</i>

137
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,320
<i>Black Wind and I rode alongside</i>

138
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,160
<i>two rabbits
running side by side.</i>

139
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,700
I think one was a male,
one was a female.

140
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,620
<i>But you know,
you can't really tell</i>

141
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,250
<i>when they're running that fast.</i>

142
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,460
When I go riding tomorrow,
I will try to find them again.

143
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,770
Maybe they'll still be there.

144
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,710
We have excellent news.

145
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,460
The matchmaker has found you
an auspicious match.

146
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,220
Yes, Mulan, it is decided.

147
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,850
Come and sit down.

148
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,650
It is what is best
for our family.

149
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,950
Yes.

150
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,040
It is best.

151
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,090
I will bring honor to us all.

152
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,420
<i>I'm truly blessed
to be in the presence</i>

153
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,320
<i>of such enchanting women.</i>

154
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,820
<i>I have no doubt today will be
a momentous day for the Hua...</i>

155
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,700
<i>Never mind that.
We must be on time.</i>

156
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,240
I'm starving.

157
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,040
I already told you,
you cannot eat.

158
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,250
It will ruin your makeup.

159
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,380
The fiercest winter storm
could not destroy this makeup.

160
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,210
<i>Xiu, look at my face.
What am I feeling?</i>

161
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,010
I have no idea.

162
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,510
Exactly.

163
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,260
<i>This is my sad face.
This is my curious face.</i>

164
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,350
And now I'm confused.

165
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,140
<i>Quiet.</i>

166
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,310
<i>Composed.</i>

167
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,190
<i>Graceful.</i>

168
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,110
<i>Elegant.</i>

169
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,410
<i>Poised.</i>

170
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,780
<i>Polite.</i>

171
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,580
<i>These are the qualities...</i>

172
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,620
<i>we see in a good wife.</i>

173
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,460
<i>These are the qualities...</i>

174
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,340
<i>we see in Mulan.</i>

175
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,180
<i>When a wife
serves her husband...</i>

176
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,180
<i>...she must be silent.</i>

177
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,600
<i>She must be...</i>

178
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,520
<i>invisible.</i>

179
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,900
<i>She must be...</i>

180
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,740
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

181
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,660
<i>No, Madam Matchmaker.
Thank you.</i>

182
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,830
<i>It's ideal for the teapot...</i>

183
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,880
<i>to remain
in the center of the table.</i>

184
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,840
Yes, I understand.

185
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,010
But I think the teapot
should remain where it is.

186
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,220
Move the teapot.

187
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,430
Girl!

188
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,020
Dishonor to the Hua family.

189
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,650
They have failed
to raise a good daughter.

190
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,850
<i>Citizens!</i>

191
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,020
Citizens, we are under attack
from Northern Invaders.

192
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,740
Our land is at war.

193
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,700
<i>By edict
of His Imperial Majesty,</i>

194
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,320
<i>the Son of Heaven...</i>

195
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,120
<i>every family must contribute
one man to fight.</i>

196
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,580
One man from every house.

197
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,920
Wáng family.

198
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,880
Chin family.

199
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,430
Dù family.

200
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,600
Hua family.

201
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,730
I am Hua Zhou.

202
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,610
<i>I served the Imperial Army</i>

203
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,240
<i>in the last battle
against the Northern Invaders.</i>

204
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,620
Have you no son
old enough to fight?

205
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,040
I am blessed with two daughters.

206
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,330
I will fight.

207
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,750
No.

208
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,550
You will
only humiliate him further.

209
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,220
<i>Are you all right?
Can I help you?</i>

210
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
No.

211
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,850
Liu family.

212
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Wei family.

213
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,190
You're a war hero.

214
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,830
You've already made
many great sacrifices.

215
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,240
<i>Are you suggesting...</i>

216
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,670
<i>our family not comply
with the Imperial edict?</i>

217
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,290
<i>But how can you fight...</i>

218
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,300
<i>I am the father.</i>

219
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,380
<i>It is my place to bring honor</i>

220
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,340
<i>to our family
on the battlefield.</i>

221
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,140
You are the daughter!

222
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,270
Learn your place.

223
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,860
We must be strong.

224
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,650
This time, he will not return.

225
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,900
It's beautiful.

226
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,570
<i>Beautiful tool...</i>

227
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,450
<i>for terrible work.</i>

228
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,870
The phoenix.

229
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,670
You remember?

230
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,800
She has followed me
into battle before,

231
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,850
and she will follow me now.

232
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:25,900
<i>And she will tell our
ancestors I've been loyal...</i>

233
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,110
<i>brave, and true.</i>

234
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,610
I wish I was as brave as you.

235
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,740
There is no courage
without fear.

236
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,490
<i>But, Father...</i>

237
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,950
<i>You must be courageous, Mulan.</i>

238
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,240
<i>For your mother</i>

239
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,500
<i>and your sister.</i>

240
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,040
<i>For me.</i>

241
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,890
It is my duty to fight.

242
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,230
My honor to sacrifice
for the emperor.

243
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,480
If I were your son,
you wouldn't have to.

244
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,950
I would change nothing
about my life.

245
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,290
We should all get some rest.

246
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,130
I'm leaving in the morning.

247
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:12,750
"Loyal, brave, and true."

248
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,340
My sword.

249
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,760
My armor! It's gone!

250
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,220
Who would do such a thing?

251
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,230
The conscription scroll.

252
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,110
It was Mulan.

253
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,070
You must stop her.

254
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,900
The Northern Invaders
will kill her!

255
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,280
If I expose her lie,
our own people will kill her.

256
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,420
<i>Ancestors,
honored phoenix...</i>

257
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,420
<i>ancestral guardian,
I beseech you...</i>

258
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,130
<i>watch over my daughter, Mulan.</i>

259
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,560
She has made a terrible mistake.

260
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,780
I taught her too late
to know her place.

261
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,610
I indulged her.

262
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,120
She is innocent of the world.

263
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,370
Of men.

264
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,580
And the evils of war.

265
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,210
And now she's in great danger.

266
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,170
<i>Please, honored phoenix...</i>

267
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,970
<i>protect her.</i>

268
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,070
Our last apple.

269
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,820
You need it more than I do.

270
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,780
We should be there by now.

271
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,240
Do you think we are lost?

272
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,920
The phoenix.

273
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,570
There were men gathering
from all over the kingdom.

274
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,820
An alien
and savage tribe to her.

275
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,160
To hide amongst them, she knew
she must become one of them.

276
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,090
I'm Cricket.

277
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,590
My mother says I was born
under an auspicious moon.

278
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,680
That is why my mother says
I'm a good luck charm.

279
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,180
Ow.

280
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,940
Need a hand, little man?

281
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,380
<i>Insult me again,</i>

282
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,840
<i>and you'll taste
the tip of my blade.</i>

283
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,240
- Lower your sword.
- Or what?

284
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,410
I'm your commanding officer.

285
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,250
Fighting will not be
tolerated. Am I clear?

286
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,590
Yes, Commander.

287
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,960
With your voice, soldier.

288
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,220
Yes, Commander.

289
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,390
What is your name?

290
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,600
Hua Jun, Commander.

291
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,980
Is this your family sword?

292
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,690
It belongs to my father,
Hua Zhou.

293
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,030
Fall in line.

294
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,050
Sorry, Ling!

295
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,100
<i>Yao, give it back!
It's not funny!</i>

296
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,270
Po, catch!

297
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,520
I told you to line up
for showers.

298
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,860
- Showers?
- Showers.

299
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,360
You lot stink.

300
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,570
And I need a volunteer

301
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,770
- for night guard duty.
- Me!

302
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,660
I mean, I volunteer, sir.

303
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,990
<i>Stealing.</i>

304
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,820
<i>Penalty, death.</i>

305
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:25,370
<i>Desertion. Penalty, death.</i>

306
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,250
<i>Bring women into camp</i>

307
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,960
<i>or consorting with women

308
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,380
<i>Penalty, death.</i>

309
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,970
<i>Dishonesty.
Penalty...</i>

310
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,430
<i>expulsion, disgrace.</i>

311
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,100
<i>Disgrace for you,
disgrace for your family...</i>

312
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,230
<i>disgrace for your village,
disgrace for your country.</i>

313
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,520
<i>We're going to make men</i>

314
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,940
<i>out of every single one of you.</i>

315
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Ow.

316
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Fire!

317
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,230
Only the strongest
will reach the summit.

318
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,490
It will take
everything you have.

319
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,160
Straighten out those arms.

320
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,870
Keep them up. Shoulder level.

321
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,580
Keep your mind strong.

322
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,040
<i>Don't stop.</i>

323
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,340
Is he crying?

324
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,730
Fire!

325
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,860
Fire!

326
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,160
<i>Give that back!</i>

327
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,220
<i>Longwei!</i>

328
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,660
<i>Report to the barracks
immediately.</i>

329
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
<i>Immediately.</i>

330
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,270
<i>Dishonesty.
Penalty, expulsion.</i>

331
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,440
<i>Disgrace.</i>

332
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,330
<i>We were matched
28 days ago.</i>

333
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,830
Her name is Li Li.

334
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,290
Her skin is white as milk.

335
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,580
Her fingers like the tender
white roots of a green onion.

336
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,960
Ling is a romantic!

337
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,960
<i>Her eyes
are like morning dewdrops...</i>

338
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,050
<i>I like my women buxom.</i>

339
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,260
With strong, wide hips.

340
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,890
I like kissing women
with cherry red lips.

341
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,070
I don't care
what she looks like.

342
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,350
- I agree.
- I care what she cooks like.

343
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,270
Tell us, Hua Jun.

344
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,980
What's your ideal woman?

345
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,400
My ideal woman is courageous.

346
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,280
<i>A courageous woman?</i>
- Yes.

347
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,580
And she has a sense of humor.

348
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,620
- She's also smart.
- Smart?

349
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,020
Well, what does she look like?

350
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,330
That's not the point.

351
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,750
<i>Courageous, funny, smart.</i>

352
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,380
<i>Hua Jun's not describing
a woman...</i>

353
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,380
<i>...he's describing me.</i>

354
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,050
<i>That's not you, Yao.
That's definitely not you.</i>

355
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,680
Not you.

356
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,600
Not you.

357
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,310
Hua Jun.

358
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,110
Don't let them bother you.

359
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,240
Especially that donkey Yao.

360
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,540
Are you matched?
Can I ask?

361
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,000
No.

362
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,620
I mean, yes.
I was.

363
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,880
Almost.

364
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,000
Didn't work out.

365
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,840
Lucky you.

366
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,760
<i>I mean, how do you
even begin to know</i>

367
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,010
<i>how to talk to a woman...</i>

368
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,140
<i>let alone be married to one?</i>

369
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,480
Just talk to her like
you are talking to me now.

370
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,690
Yeah, I wish it was that easy.

371
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,030
What if she doesn't like me?

372
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,110
She will.

373
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,540
I mean,
I think she will, you know?

374
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,290
You never know with women.

375
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,100
<i>You should really consider
skipping guard duty</i>

376
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,380
<i>and taking a shower.</i>

377
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,760
You stink, my friend.

378
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,170
You idiot.

379
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,800
Now everyone sees it.

380
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,670
You must hide your chi!

381
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,680
Hua Jun!

382
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,850
Who knew?

383
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,310
What a killer!

384
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,190
You reek, soldier.

385
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,480
Have you even showered once yet?

386
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,650
You smell bad.

387
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,280
Mm-hmm.

388
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,540
Hua Jun.

389
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,500
I'm glad I found you.

390
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,830
I see you're finally
getting clean.

391
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,790
The Fifth Battalion thanks you.

392
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,340
I came here to be alone.

393
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,580
What was that today?

394
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,510
It was incredible.

395
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,220
<i>I don't wanna talk about it.</i>
- Why not?

396
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,970
I can't believe all this time

397
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,370
you've been keeping
your skill a secret.

398
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,980
What else have you been hiding?

399
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,780
Nothing.

400
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,400
Leave me alone.

401
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,410
Hua Jun, we started off
on the wrong foot.

402
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,870
Can we be friends?

403
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,750
I'm not your friend.

404
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,250
Very well.

405
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,250
But you are my equal.

406
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,300
We fight together
against the same enemy.

407
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,680
I will do all I can
to protect the others.

408
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,010
<i>You can turn your back on me...</i>

409
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,940
<i>but when the time comes,
do not turn your back on them.</i>

410
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,620
<i>I welcome the leaders</i>

411
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,830
<i>of the 12 Rouran tribes...</i>

412
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,040
<i>as we approach
the final victory.</i>

413
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,590
Soon the Imperial City
will be ours.

414
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,590
But we're relying on a witch.

415
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,440
Yes, a witch.

416
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,730
A witch
cannot be trusted!

417
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,000
<i>She is no threat.</i>

418
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,930
Hush! Enough!

419
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,560
<i>Make no mistake...</i>

420
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,270
<i>the witch serves me
and therefore, all of us.</i>

421
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,810
She knows who her master is.

422
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,320
Consider our future.

423
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,240
<i>This, my friends...</i>

424
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,330
<i>is just a small taste
of what is to come.</i>

425
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,120
From the Imperial City ahead,

426
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,750
riches will flow
like a mighty river.

427
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,580
I don't care about riches.

428
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,930
How much gold can a nomad carry?

429
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,730
<i>Then,
I will give you revenge...</i>

430
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,440
<i>for the land we lost
to the empire.</i>

431
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,020
For the shame of the last war.

432
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,070
For my father,
who the emperor killed.

433
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,950
<i>If gold is not enough...</i>

434
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,280
<i>I will give you blood.</i>

435
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,490
Sharpen your swords.

436
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,080
Our time has come.

437
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,420
<i>Now I know.
I serve you.</i>

438
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,880
I am the slave.

439
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,590
And you would
do well to remember it.

440
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,760
<i>Over there, witch.
The next garrison.</i>

441
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,550
Destroy it.

442
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,030
Hua Jun.

443
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,240
Report to Commander Tung.

444
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,720
Hua Jun, Commander.

445
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,510
Enter.

446
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,560
Hua Jun.

447
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,490
It seems you have been
hiding something.

448
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,030
<i>- Commander...
- I sensed it</i>

449
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,660
<i>the moment I met you.</i>

450
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,040
But now I'm sure.

451
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,670
You see,
I have a secret as well.

452
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,290
I know your father.

453
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,300
He was a great soldier.

454
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,630
<i>In you, Hua Jun...</i>

455
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,800
<i>I see the shadow of his sword.</i>

456
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,220
Perhaps this shadow
falls heavy on your shoulders.

457
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,260
You can't allow your father's
legacy to hold you back.

458
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,020
You need to cultivate your gift.

459
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,690
Sir.

460
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,940
Your chi is powerful, Hua Jun.

461
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,610
Why do you hide it?

462
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,530
<i>I...</i> I don't know.

463
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,110
<i>The chi
pervades the universe</i>

464
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,670
<i>and all living things.</i>

465
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,760
<i>We are all born with it.</i>

466
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,680
<i>But only the most true will
connect deeply to his chi...</i>

467
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,690
<i>and become a great warrior.</i>

468
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,230
<i>Tranquil as a forest...</i>

469
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,280
<i>but on fire within.</i>

470
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,700
<i>The Rouran enemy is vast.</i>

471
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,960
<i>They are ruthless
and unpredictable.</i>

472
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,630
<i>Yet physical force</i>

473
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,880
<i>need not be met
with equal force.</i>

474
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,970
<i>The warrior yields to force
and redirects it.</i>

475
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,510
<i>Disadvantage can be turned
into an advantage.</i>

476
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,850
<i>Four ounces
can move 1,000 pounds.</i>

477
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,250
<i>The garrisons
continue to fall</i>

478
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,790
<i>to the Northern Invaders.</i>

479
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,790
<i>We have been called to war,</i>

480
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,840
<i>even though our training
is not finished.</i>

481
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,440
<i>We leave to defend</i>

482
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,570
<i>the Mountain-Steppe Garrison</i>

483
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,050
<i>against the Rouran invader.</i>

484
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,970
Up until now, you've been
boys playing soldiers.

485
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,850
Today, you become men.

486
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,680
<i>You will now take the oath
of the warrior...</i>

487
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,690
<i>pledging fidelity to
the three pillars of virtue.</i>

488
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,230
<i>The enemy possesses
none of these...</i>

489
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,860
<i>and therefore can be defeated.</i>

490
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,240
Remember this when you
meet him on the battlefield.

491
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,030
Draw sword!

492
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,990
<i>Loyal.</i>
- <i>Loyal!</i>

493
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,660
<i>Brave.</i>
- <i>Brave!</i>

494
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,370
<i>True.</i>
- <i>True!</i>

495
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,380
Return swords!

496
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,180
In!

497
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,990
Commander Tung, it's Hua Jun.

498
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,280
You may enter.

499
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,960
<i>Commander Tung,</i>

500
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,010
<i>there's something that weighs
heavily on my heart.</i>

501
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,720
I need to confess it to you.

502
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,640
It has to do
with the three virtues.

503
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,470
There's no shame in being
fearful before battle.

504
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,060
<i>In fact, it's a testament
to your honesty...</i>

505
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,230
<i>that you confess such doubt.</i>

506
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,320
<i>Yes, Commander.
But the other virtues...</i>

507
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,820
Hua Jun.

508
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,160
You're a good man.

509
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,910
<i>Perhaps one day
you could accompany me</i>

510
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,490
<i>to my village...</i>

511
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,300
<i>where I will introduce you
to my daughter.</i>

512
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,080
And our village matchmaker,
of course.

513
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:45,300
<i>Yes, Commander.
That's my great honor.</i>

514
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,840
<i>I look forward
to seeing your father's face</i>

515
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:50,100
<i>when you give him this news.</i>

516
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,090
The Fourth Battalion.

517
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,300
This is the work of Böri Khan.

518
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,140
There's no one left.

519
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,210
<i>The Mountain-Steppe
Garrison welcomes...</i>

520
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,260
<i>the Fifth Battalion of
His Majesty's Imperial Army.</i>

521
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:17,140
Scouts at the gate!

522
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,190
Böri Khan assembles not
a half day's ride from here.

523
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,450
They prepare for battle.

524
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:31,700
We're greatly outnumbered.

525
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,090
Fortify for a siege!

526
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,910
<i>No. He who moves first
controls the enemy.</i>

527
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,870
We leave at first light.

528
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:45,930
<i>Anything you want me
to tell your mothers</i>

529
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,170
<i>when you die?</i>

530
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,050
That's not funny.

531
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,010
What's the matter? Scared?

532
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,100
No.

533
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,060
Who knows who will live
past tomorrow?

534
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,390
We may never see
each other again.

535
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,360
<i>My father once said...</i>

536
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,230
"There is no courage
without fear."

537
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,400
So?

538
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,570
So this is natural.

539
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,200
Well, it doesn't feel natural.

540
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:29,340
Listen to me, all of you.

541
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,720
We will live.

542
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,050
I guarantee it.

543
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,600
Because I will protect you.

544
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,140
We'll protect each other.

545
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,230
We'll fight for each other.

546
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,870
Except for you, Yao.

547
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:00,330
I might take the opportunity
to kill you myself.

548
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,220
They've left
the garrison.

549
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,330
A bold move
that changes nothing.

550
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,620
The plan continues.

551
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,960
Charge!

552
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,470
Spear men, open!

553
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,520
Archers, ready!

554
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,150
Raise!

555
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,220
Release!

556
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,030
<i>The coward retreats!
Pursue them!</i>

557
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,910
Left flank! Charge!

558
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,580
You're a witch.

559
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,750
Am I?

560
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,830
And who are you?

561
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:02,170
I'm Hua Jun.

562
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:04,880
Soldier in the emperor's
Imperial Army.

563
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,310
Liar.

564
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,480
Your deceit weakens you.

565
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,520
It poisons your chi.

566
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,730
<i>I ask again...</i>

567
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,320
who are you?

568
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,110
I'm Hua Jun.

569
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,320
Soldier in the emperor's
Imperial Army!

570
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,120
<i>Then you will die</i>

571
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,040
<i>pretending to be
something you're not.</i>

572
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,770
And Hua Jun did die.

573
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:50,450
For a lie can only live so long.

574
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,990
<i>But Mulan...</i>

575
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,330
<i>Mulan lived.</i>

576
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,440
"True."

577
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,030
Witch!

578
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,650
She's a witch!

579
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,250
Defensive position!

580
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,760
Don't run! We hold formation.

581
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,360
Now!

582
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:21,530
Fire!

583
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,250
No!

584
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,580
<i>They're targeting us!
We're dead if we stay here!</i>

585
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:14,170
<i>Enemy on the ridge!
Turn around!</i>

586
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,170
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

587
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:22,840
Turn it around!

588
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:24,390
Move it! Move!

589
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,440
Fire!

590
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:29,490
Run!

591
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,720
Cricket!

592
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,270
Go! Go! Go!

593
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:04,110
Honghui!

594
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,370
Honghui!

595
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,910
Gather yourselves.

596
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,410
Find your comrades.

597
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,500
The enemy has been defeated.

598
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:43,080
Sergeant Qiang,
regroup the men.

599
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,880
Has anyone seen Hua Jun?

600
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:57,430
Have you seen Hua Jun?

601
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,690
Hua Jun?

602
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,880
I'm Hua Mulan.

603
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:33,840
Forgive me.

604
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,350
He's a girl?

605
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,650
You are an imposter.

606
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,900
You've betrayed the regiment.

607
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:52,820
You've brought disgrace
to the Hua family.

608
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:55,820
<i>- Commander...</i>
- Your deceit is my shame.

609
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,660
<i>Commander,</i>

610
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,660
<i>what is the punishment
assigned to this imposter?</i>

611
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,710
Expulsion.

612
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,210
I would rather be executed.

613
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,680
<i>From
this moment forward,</i>

614
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,050
<i>you are expelled from
the emperor's Imperial Army.</i>

615
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,810
<i>If you
show your face again...</i>

616
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:29,020
<i>your wish to be executed
will be granted.</i>

617
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,150
You can never go home.

618
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:17,780
Your disgrace
is worse than death.

619
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,670
I understand.

620
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,600
I was a girl like you
when people turned on me.

621
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,560
You don't think
I longed for a noble path?

622
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:55,440
I've lived a life of exile.

623
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:01,160
No country,
no village, no family.

624
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,830
We are the same.

625
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,170
- We're not.
- We are.

626
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:14,500
The more power I showed,
the more I was crushed.

627
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:17,050
Just like you.

628
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:21,720
You saved them today
and still they turned on you.

629
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,100
You are just at the beginning
of your power.

630
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,560
Merge your path with mine.

631
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,770
We will be stronger together.

632
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:38,700
<i>You follow a coward.
A leader who runs from battle.</i>

633
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:42,030
Böri Khan
did not run from battle.

634
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:46,120
<i>That coward
will take the Imperial City...</i>

635
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:48,410
<i>and your emperor will fall.</i>

636
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,080
That can't happen.

637
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:54,840
But it happens even now.

638
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,300
Join me.

639
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:05,510
We will take our place together.

640
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,480
I know my place.

641
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:18,940
<i>And it is my duty...</i>

642
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:23,450
<i>to fight for the kingdom
and protect the emperor.</i>

643
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,770
Commander Tung!

644
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:55,440
What is the meaning of this?

645
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:57,480
Commander Tung,
we must ride to the emperor.

646
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:58,980
His life is in danger.

647
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:01,070
The emperor's life
has never been safer.

648
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,920
That's what Böri Khan
wants you to believe.

649
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:08,280
Please,
you have to listen to me.

650
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:11,080
Sergeant, hand me my sword.

651
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,960
<i>Kill me if you must.
But first, listen.</i>

652
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,670
The garrison attacks
were just a distraction.

653
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,180
<i>Khan has our army focused
on the Silk Road...</i>

654
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:27,820
<i>so he can sneak
into the Imperial City</i>

655
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,390
<i>and kill the emperor.</i>

656
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,520
Böri Khan is already far ahead.

657
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,640
The Imperial Army
can't stop him now.

658
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:39,230
But perhaps a small,
well-trained force could.

659
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,940
<i>When employed correctly...</i>

660
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,620
<i>four ounces
can move 1,000 pounds.</i>

661
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:54,580
<i>Only a foolish man listens to
someone whose very existence</i>

662
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,080
<i>is a lie.</i>

663
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:04,840
You would believe Hua Jun.

664
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:06,510
Why do you not believe
Hua Mulan?

665
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:10,640
She risked everything by
revealing her true identity.

666
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,430
She's braver than any man here.

667
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,020
And she's the best warrior
amongst us.

668
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:24,410
<i>- I believe Hua Mulan.
- I believe Hua Mulan.</i>

669
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,950
- <i>I believe Hua Mulan.</i>
- <i>I believe Hua Mulan.</i>

670
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:28,170
<i>I believe Hua Mulan.</i>

671
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,440
<i>I believe Hua Mulan.</i>

672
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,170
<i>Hua Mulan...</i>

673
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,420
<i>your actions have brought
disgrace and dishonor</i>

674
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,880
<i>to this regiment...</i>

675
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:48,260
<i>to this kingdom
and to your own family.</i>

676
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:52,760
But your loyalty and bravery
are without question.

677
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,690
You will lead us as we ride
to the Imperial City.

678
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,730
Ready the horses.

679
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:24,860
<i>Your Majesty, a word.
In private.</i>

680
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,570
<i>Despite the Rouran army's
crushing defeat...</i>

681
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:32,030
<i>scouts have informed me</i>

682
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:34,030
<i>that Böri Khan
has infiltrated the city.</i>

683
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,040
He assembles at the New Palace.

684
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,540
He offers a duel.

685
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,290
Prepare my guards.

686
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:44,170
We ride to the site immediately.

687
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,250
Your Majesty,
it is far too dangerous.

688
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,460
Silence!

689
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:50,720
My people have suffered enough.

690
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,930
Now I must act.

691
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:58,100
I will kill this Böri Khan
like I killed his father.

692
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,970
With my own hands.

693
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:17,990
<i>Assemble
all Imperial guardsmen</i>

694
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,830
<i>immediately in this square.</i>

695
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:24,500
That includes every guard
on every tower and every gate.

696
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:26,500
But who will protect the city?

697
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,550
You question the judgement
of His Majesty the Emperor?

698
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:35,050
<i>Of course not, Chancellor.
I will see to it immediately.</i>

699
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,080
It's time.

700
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,840
The gates are open!

701
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:19,010
<i>The streets are empty!
Why are there no guards?</i>

702
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:42,540
Ambush!

703
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:44,290
Protect the emperor!

704
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,540
Clear her path!

705
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,790
<i>Don't leave her side!
She must get through.</i>

706
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:42,800
Surely you didn't
expect a fair fight?

707
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:46,350
How did you convince
my chancellor to betray me?

708
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,270
That was not your chancellor.

709
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,640
Now!

710
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,280
<i>Join the others.
Take the city.</i>

711
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:05,910
Kill every
last Imperial soldier.

712
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:18,290
You need to find the emperor.

713
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,050
We'll hold them back.

714
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,470
Till next we meet, Honghui.

715
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,540
Go! Go!

716
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:58,800
Bolt the door.

717
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,800
Bolt the door.

718
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,540
Your Majesty, I'm Hua Mulan
from the Fifth Battalion.

719
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,830
I've come to protect you.

720
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,330
Impossible.

721
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,090
A woman leading a man's army.

722
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,510
Where's the emperor?

723
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:53,690
You were right.

724
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,350
We are the same.

725
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,060
With one difference.

726
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:03,610
They accept you,
but they will never accept me.

727
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,030
You told me
my journey was impossible.

728
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,910
Yet here I stand.

729
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:13,660
Proof that there is a place
for people like us.

730
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:15,620
No.

731
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,550
It's too late for me.

732
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,550
You can still take
the noble path.

733
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,270
It's not too late.

734
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,150
Please.

735
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,190
I need your help.

736
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:45,780
Where's the emperor?

737
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,960
They tell me
this palace is being built

738
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:46,760
in honor of your father.

739
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,390
<i>And in honor of my father...</i>

740
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:54,430
<i>this is where you will die.</i>

741
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:59,770
Or should I say "burn"?

742
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,570
Who will come to save you,
Son of Heaven?

743
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:06,820
Where are the sons
of the empire?

744
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:09,070
I will tell you.

745
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:13,580
<i>Fallen to our swords.
Pierced by our arrows.</i>

746
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,080
Who will save you?

747
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:31,550
Why are you here?

748
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,970
The attack has met
a fierce resistance.

749
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,770
<i>From who?
A young woman...</i>

750
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:38,730
<i>from a small village.</i>

751
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,600
A girl?

752
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:42,600
A woman.

753
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:43,730
A warrior.

754
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:49,320
A woman leads the army.

755
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:53,320
And she's no scorned dog.

756
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:57,740
You led her here.

757
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,690
<i>Take your place...</i>

758
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:27,320
Mulan.

759
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:52,610
The girl who has come
to save the dynasty.

760
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,810
No!

761
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,950
Rise up.

762
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,040
You are a mighty warrior.

763
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:48,500
Rise up like a phoenix.

764
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:51,840
Fight for the kingdom
and its people.

765
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:36,880
Stand up, soldier.

766
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:49,470
Tell me your name.

767
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:23,880
Your Imperial Highness,
Hua Mulan.

768
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:41,610
Hua Mulan, the people owe you
a debt of thanks.

769
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,570
I owe you my life.

770
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:49,030
<i>In gratitude for your service
and dedication...</i>

771
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,490
<i>I invite you
to take your place...</i>

772
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:54,870
<i>with our greatest
decorated warriors...</i>

773
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:59,210
<i>as an officer
in the Emperor's Guard.</i>

774
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:02,840
<i>Your Majesty...</i>

775
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:07,260
<i>I'm deeply honored by this
immeasurable invitation...</i>

776
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:10,340
<i>but with humble apologies...</i>

777
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:13,970
<i>I cannot accept it.</i>

778
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:24,570
<i>I left home
under cover of darkness...</i>

779
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:27,690
<i>and betrayed my family's trust.</i>

780
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:33,070
I made choices I knew
would risk their dishonor.

781
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:35,620
<i>Since then...</i>

782
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,620
<i>I have pledged an oath...</i>

783
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:43,790
<i>to be loyal, brave, and true.</i>

784
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:49,920
<i>In order to fulfill this oath...</i>

785
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:56,430
<i>I must return home
and make amends to my family.</i>

786
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,640
Very well, Hua Mulan.

787
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:09,110
Devotion to family
is an essential virtue.

788
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:25,460
You can't leave.

789
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:35,350
<i>The emperor
gives his permission...</i>

790
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:36,810
<i>but you do not?</i>

791
01:37:39,390 --> 01:37:40,600
We've not yet said goodbye.

792
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:49,400
Goodbye, Honghui.

793
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:59,870
You still won't take my hand?

794
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:19,930
I will see you again,
Hua Mulan.

795
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:52,130
Mulan has returned!

796
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:53,760
Mulan!

797
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:57,180
Mulan?

798
01:38:58,890 --> 01:38:59,890
Mother!

799
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:01,720
Mulan!

800
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:45,560
There is so much
I have to ask you.

801
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:46,940
Tell me about you first.

802
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:48,690
<i>I...</i> I am matched!

803
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:49,900
What's he like?

804
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,520
<i>He's handsome, a little shy,</i>

805
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:52,670
<i>but he's not afraid of spiders.</i>

806
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:54,090
- <i>Mulan!</i>
- <i>I'm so happy for you.</i>

807
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:25,350
Forgive me, Father.

808
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:31,310
<i>I stole your horse...</i>

809
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:35,360
<i>I stole your sword,
I stole your armor.</i>

810
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:40,910
<i>And the sword...</i> I lost it.

811
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:44,700
The sword is gone.

812
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:48,540
<i>Now I understand...</i>

813
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:52,420
How much that sword
means to you.

814
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:02,510
It is my daughter
that means everything to me.

815
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:09,810
And it is I should apologize.

816
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:16,020
My foolish pride drove you away.

817
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:29,830
One warrior knows another.

818
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:34,580
<i>You were always there...</i>

819
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:37,590
<i>yet I see you
for the first time.</i>

820
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:12,830
Hello, old friend.

821
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,590
<i>Tung Yong...</i>

822
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:22,800
I am honored to receive you
and the Emperor's Guard.

823
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,760
<i>But if you are here
to discipline Mulan...</i>

824
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:29,220
<i>you have to get past me.</i>

825
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:32,180
I do not believe
that will be necessary.

826
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:36,790
<i>Under order</i>

827
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:39,020
<i>of His Imperial Majesty
the Emperor,</i>

828
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:42,400
<i>we present this gift
to Hua Mulan.</i>

829
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:45,700
She has saved the dynasty.

830
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:49,580
The entire kingdom
is in her debt.

831
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,520
<i>She has brought honor</i>

832
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,470
<i>to her ancestors...</i>

833
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:07,640
<i>to her family,
to her village...</i>

834
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,560
<i>and to her country.</i>

835
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,220
<i>As befits a great warrior...</i>

836
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:14,230
<i>the sword is marked
with the pillars of virtue.</i>

837
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:19,690
<i>Loyal, brave, true.</i>

838
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:28,820
And what is this fourth virtue
I see?

839
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:30,370
Read it aloud, Mulan.

840
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,620
"Devotion to family."

841
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,710
You have brought honor
to us all.

842
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:38,140
<i>The emperor urges you</i>

843
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:40,130
<i>to reconsider his invitation</i>

844
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:42,710
<i>to join our greatest
decorated warriors...</i>

845
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,970
<i>as an officer
in the Emperor's Guard.</i>

846
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,560
He awaits your decision.

847
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:10,320
<i>The green shoot
has grown up to the sky...</i>

848
01:44:11,570 --> 01:44:13,740
<i>and her ancestors celebrate her</i>

849
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:15,540
<i>in the vault of the heavens.</i>

850
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:21,000
The girl became a soldier.

851
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:23,380
The soldier became a leader.

852
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:26,840
<i>And the leader...</i>

853
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,680
<i>became a legend.</i>

854
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:53,030
War is not freedom.

855
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,540
<i>Over my shoulder</i>

856
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:58,830
<i>I see a clearer view.</i>

857
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:03,130
All for my family.

858
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:05,670
Reason I'm breathing.

859
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:09,090
Everything to lose.

860
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:14,510
Should I ask myself
in the water.

861
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:18,930
What a warrior would do?

862
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:24,650
Tell me underneath my armor.

863
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:29,070
<i>Am I loyal, brave, and true?</i>

864
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:34,240
<i>Am I loyal, brave, and true?</i>

865
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,460
Losing is easy.

866
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:51,010
Winning takes bravery

867
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:54,390
I am a tiger's fool.

868
01:45:55,970 --> 01:45:58,520
Out in the open.

869
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,980
No one to save me.

870
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:04,690
The kindest of whispers
are cruel.

871
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:09,940
Should I ask myself
in the water.

872
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:14,320
What a warrior would do?

873
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:19,950
Tell me underneath my armor.

874
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:24,670
<i>Am I loyal, brave, and true?</i>

875
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:29,840
<i>Am I loyal, brave, and true?</i>

876
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,470
Cold is the morning.

877
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:34,970
Warm is the dream.

878
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:37,470
Chasing the answers.

879
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:40,140
'Til I can't sleep.

880
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:42,430
Will I be stronger.

881
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,890
Or will I be weak.

882
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:49,070
When you're not with me?

883
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:55,160
Who am I without my armor.

884
01:46:56,110 --> 01:47:00,120
Standing in my father's shoes?

885
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:05,500
All I know is that it's harder.

886
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:12,050
<i>To be loyal, brave, and true</i>

887
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:29,980
Look at me.

888
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:32,530
You may think you see.

889
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:35,200
Who I really am.

890
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,780
But you'll never know me.

891
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,160
Every day.

892
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:45,290
It's as if I play a part.

893
01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:47,420
Now I see.

894
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:50,000
If I wear a mask

895
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:52,710
I can fool the world.

896
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,510
But I cannot fool my heart.

897
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:05,140
Who is that girl I see.

898
01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:10,270
Staring straight back at me?

899
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:15,400
When will my reflection show.

900
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:22,450
Who I am inside?

901
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:25,040
I am now.

902
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:30,210
In a world
where I have to hide my heart.

903
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:32,790
And what I believe in.

904
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,920
<i>But somehow</i>

905
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,180
<i>I will show the world
what's inside my heart.</i>

906
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:45,220
And be loved for who I am.

907
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:52,900
Who is that girl I see.

908
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:57,740
Staring straight back at me?

909
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:02,950
Why is my reflection someone

910
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:07,250
I don't know?

911
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:11,080
Must I pretend.

912
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:17,710
That I'm someone else
for all time?

913
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:22,890
When will my reflection show.

914
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:27,310
Who I am inside?

915
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:31,900
There's a heart
that must be free.

916
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:34,730
To fly.

917
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:40,070
That burns with a need to know.

918
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:45,450
The reason why.

919
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:50,710
Why must we all conceal.

920
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:55,460
What we think, how we feel?

921
01:49:55,540 --> 01:50:00,170
Must there be a secret me

922
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:05,390
I'm forced to hide?

923
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:10,730
I won't pretend that I'm.

924
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:15,400
Someone else for all time.

925
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:20,860
When will my reflection show.

926
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:27,910
Who I am inside?

927
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:38,880
When will my reflection show.

928
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:46,850
Who I am inside?

929
01:50:47,305 --> 01:51:47,581
