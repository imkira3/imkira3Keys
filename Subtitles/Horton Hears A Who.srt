1
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:35,053
On the fifteenth of May,

2
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:36,659
in the jungle of Nool,

3
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,391
in the heat of the day,

4
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,054
in the cool of the pool,

5
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:44,391
he was splashing,
enjoying the jungle's great joys.

6
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:51,129
And Horton, the elephant,
heard a small noise.

7
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:02,746
- Horton!
- Horton!

8
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:05,501
Good morning, class.
Are you ready?

9
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,425
Yeah!

10
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,119
Jump on board!

11
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,919
Look out, below!

12
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:11,973
Tommy's on board.

13
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:13,574
Katie, you there?

14
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:18,197
- Ha-Ah-A.
- O.K.

15
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:21,813
There it is.

16
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:24,649
This is one of the jungle's
most amazing creatures.

17
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:26,075
The leaf bug.

18
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:28,320
In order to protect itself from predators

19
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:31,200
It disguises itself as a leaf

20
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:39,501
This one's got quite a deep grip.

21
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,999
Come on, little buddy!
Don't be shy!

22
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:46,241
I guess I was mistaken, Kids.

23
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:49,486
There are obviously no leaf bugs in this area.

24
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,136
- Oh, yeah.
- Even a per... Oh! They're on me.

25
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,476
Look at, there are bugs

26
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:58,355
I think I swallowed it.

27
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,619
Shoot up!
Uh-ek it's not coming.

28
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:01,506
Pull it out.

29
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,485
Uh, OK.

30
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,451
Then, humphing her nose
was sour Kangaroo.

31
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,378
A type who's convince
she knows better than you

32
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:17,703
She made every law
and then forced every rule

33
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:21,063
as self conclaimed head
of the jungle of the Nool.

34
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,285
Why can't I play with
the other kids, Mom?

35
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,078
How many times have I told you?

36
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:29,685
The jungle is no place
to act like a wild animal.

37
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:42,541
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric?

38
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,689
And that children are learning
so much from him.

39
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:48,802
Learning to be a bunch a
hell brain half-wits.

40
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:52,421
And that's why my Rudy
is pouch schooled.

41
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:55,134
So, while Kangaroos
still there sneering a sneer

42
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:57,095
Horton, how it's the best time of my life.

43
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,897
What are you gonna show us then?

44
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:03,037
Once again the speck floated
right by Horton's ear.

45
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:05,214
And he heard it again.

46
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:10,137
Just a very faint yelp,
as if some tiny person were calling for help.

47
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:14,968
And you know what he thought?

48
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:19,654
What he thought there must be someone
on top of that small speck of dust.

49
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:22,076
Or even a family.
It just might be so.

50
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:25,413
A family with children just starting to grow.

51
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,712
I wanna live!

52
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:34,430
I got to go.
Katie, you're in charge.

53
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:39,705
Wait!

54
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:41,424
Come back!

55
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:10,890
One more, one more,
One more, one more.

56
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:19,146
- Ah here someone coming.
- Get here those.

57
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:22,924
- Wait!
- Sound the alarm!

58
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,514
Excuse me!
On my stamp feet!

59
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:30,991
Sorry, Wickershams.

60
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,369
I promise I'm gonna
clean all this up later!

61
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:35,372
Bring the arrow!

62
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,891
I love the smell of
the banana's in the morning.

63
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,677
Bananing Hou!

64
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,524
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!

65
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,571
Whou!

66
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:59,188
I feel diplomatic process
is beginning to break down.

67
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:02,379
There you are.

68
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:04,356
I'll catch it. catch it.

69
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:09,890
- Hi, kids.
- Wow!

70
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:25,115
There

71
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,473
Now you're safe.

72
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,710
I know I heard you say something.

73
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:32,744
I just know it.

74
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:35,830
Where are you?

75
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,875
- Horton?
- Uhoo, sorry.

76
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,281
I just... ah.

77
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:49,936
There was this speck.

78
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,786
And the... they called up for help.

79
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,044
- And I was...
- The speck...

80
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,587
called out for help?

81
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:56,544
Well not the speck. I mean

82
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,633
That's ridiculous.

83
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:00,784
Is what you thought I've been?

84
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:04,162
No, the speck can't call out for help.
Come on.

85
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:05,746
Get real!

86
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:07,593
No.

87
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:11,038
There's tiny person on that speck
and needs my help.

88
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:12,907
Absurd.

89
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,250
There aren't people that small.

90
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:17,513
Whoa, maybe thay aren't small.

91
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:18,921
Maybe...

92
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:19,924
We're big.

93
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,473
- Horton!
- No! Really, think about it.

94
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,892
What if there is someone

95
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:25,264
way out there,

96
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,598
looking down on our world right now.

97
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:30,158
And to them, we are the speck.

98
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,179
And then this someone else come along,
he say,

99
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:33,679
"Oh, there can't be people that small. "

100
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:34,814
And the first guy would say

101
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:35,866
"Are you calling me a liar?"

102
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,313
And the second guy would say

103
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:38,705
"If the shoe fits wear it,

104
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,028
and now that fits a blind. "

105
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,165
and the first guy pick supper break.

106
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,994
And you might wanna zip up
the pouch for this next part.

107
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:45,282
Alright, Fat boy!

108
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,257
- You want some of there...
- Horton?

109
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:49,841
There is nothing on that speck.

110
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:51,987
But I heard.

111
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:55,701
Did you?
Really? Oh my!

112
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:59,022
Then how come I don't hear anything.

113
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,238
Well?

114
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:06,063
If you can't see, hear, or feel something,

115
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:07,688
it doesn't exist.

116
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:13,691
Believing in tiny imaginary people
is just not something we do.

117
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,624
Or tolerate here in the jungle of Nool.

118
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,074
Really?

119
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:20,793
Cause I verified I really tried

120
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,679
I can find somebody

121
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:23,706
- who believe what I'm saying.
- You will do nothing of the sort.

122
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:27,014
You will not breathe the word of
this lie to anyone else.

123
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,082
Specially the children.

124
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:32,558
I do not want you poisoning their minds
with this nonsense.

125
00:10:33,806 --> 00:10:36,221
Our community has standards, Horton.

126
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:40,243
If you wanna remain a part of that,
I recommend you follow them.

127
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:44,704
Have a nice day.

128
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:48,553
Alright then!

129
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:50,734
I'll ah... take that an advice.

130
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,686
Certainly appreciate your input.

131
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,348
I don't understand.

132
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:58,862
I know I heard you.

133
00:10:58,897 --> 00:11:01,149
It was just clean as nose on my face.

134
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:03,325
That's it.

135
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:05,503
Maybe you can't hear me!

136
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:08,606
Of course your ears must be tiny.

137
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:10,640
I need to speak up!

138
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:16,007
H- E-L-L-O-W!

139
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,418
Now some people out there

140
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,760
might think I know who

141
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:21,893
they find they agreed
with that Sour Kangaroo

142
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:25,911
"There can't really be people as small as a mice"

143
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:28,282
Well there can.
And there are.

144
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:31,088
Becuase Horton was right.

145
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:43,289
Hellow!

146
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,919
That single "Hellow" traveled all the way down

147
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:53,226
to the speck, to the flowers,
to the fount of the small town.

148
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:56,914
The town known as Whoville
for there live the Whos

149
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,981
Really happy in safe,
knowing only good news,

150
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,988
unaware that their world
was a speck on a clover,

151
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,686
unaware the sweet life
they knew might be old

152
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:14,989
The Mayor of Whoville
a man named McDodd

153
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:18,483
who's devoted and faired
and little bit odd.

154
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:38,754
The Mayor and his wife
they had children to spare.

155
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:42,606
96 daughters, some here
and some there.

156
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:47,490
96 girls to love,
96 girls to teach.

157
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:51,712
But the Mayors have only few second for each.

158
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:55,416
Daddy, I do better than best on my whostory test.

159
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,570
Ah, whostory. I remembered well.

160
00:12:57,605 --> 00:12:58,913
That's one of my girls.

161
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,792
Her is has been using my hairbrush?

162
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:02,496
Her is has been using my hairbrush.

163
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,815
Look, over there!

164
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:06,620
There, all better.

165
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,932
Can I please have whophone, daddy?

166
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,929
Everyone else in my class has one.

167
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:13,371
Oh, really? Everyone?

168
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:19,685
- Aw! I will think about it.
- Daddy, look! Daddy look!

169
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,389
Toos!

170
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:28,014
It's "th" sweetheart.
It's "Tooth"

171
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,576
In Whoville tradition, unlike yours or mine,

172
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:33,281
Mayor's oldest is the next Mayor of line.

173
00:13:33,316 --> 00:13:36,251
And who was the oldest lead and stand tall?

174
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:39,186
It was JoJo, his son,
the smallest who all.

175
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:41,962
So, JoJo, what's what's shaking?

176
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:44,704
What's happening?
What's the world?

177
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:48,226
Now to you or to me, it's finally clear

178
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,227
that JoJo did not want his father's career.

179
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:54,982
But the Mayor pressed forward
completely illuded.

180
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,721
And JoJo just sat there in silence and lude it.

181
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,089
Oh, JoJo!

182
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,835
- Hey! Why this he get more time?
- That's not fair!

183
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:10,809
Son! Hey!

184
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:12,292
And why didn't he speak?

185
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:15,284
Well I think the leg was
frightened if he did,

186
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,175
he might let down his dad.

187
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,032
You know what's awesome?

188
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:21,600
This is awesome!

189
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:26,965
Just look at the men and the women
hanging on these walls.

190
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,296
You, my boy, are part of family legacy
that spans centuries

191
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:33,748
You know what?

192
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:38,049
Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville.

193
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:43,050
And, your great grandmother, that's right.

194
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,805
All the way down to your

195
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,659
Great

196
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:51,742
Not so great

197
00:14:51,777 --> 00:14:52,755
Great, Great

198
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,520
Great, Great, Great

199
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,226
Great~!

200
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,060
Grandfather!

201
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,811
Some day I hope to join them.

202
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:06,937
Be one of the Grates.

203
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,769
I tell you JoJo there is nothing like being Mayor.

204
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:15,740
I get to sign resolutions,
approve ordinances, submit budgets.

205
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:16,981
And in the edible parade

206
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,232
I'm the one city noun top of the giant people.

207
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:23,554
Some day

208
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:26,198
That can be you too, JoJo.

209
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:31,765
Some day you'll be the one
wearing the Mayor crest.

210
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:33,365
You just...

211
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,506
You just need to...

212
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:38,927
You know what I mean?

213
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:42,950
O.K. Good chat!

214
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:47,178
I'm glad that we had this talk

215
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:52,330
That I'm continuing now by myself.
Good.

216
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:01,444
Oh! There. There are to become fit.

217
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:10,313
Nothing wrong with this Morton.
Nothing wrong with this.

218
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:12,986
Just you and me in the speck.

219
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,808
Shouldn't a breeze.

220
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,464
We're club. We're group.

221
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,497
We can take a vote on issues.

222
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:21,515
We can be a secret to society

223
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,222
- to control pirate's power in the world.
- Horton?

224
00:16:24,257 --> 00:16:25,723
And no one else can join

225
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,189
Unless they wear funny hats.

226
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:31,443
Listen, Horton!

227
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,758
The chair reconize it's brother Morton.

228
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:37,951
I am really happy
you found this speck in all.

229
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:42,789
But you might wanna
think about keeping it to yourself.

230
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,600
Um, what, what?

231
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,430
Are you talking to what clover.

232
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,188
That doesn't look good.

233
00:16:51,953 --> 00:16:53,641
You know what doesn't look good?

234
00:16:54,184 --> 00:16:57,422
You, talking about the speck
like the speck isn't even there.

235
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:59,676
Speck never said nothing bad about you.

236
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,317
But hey!

237
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:03,546
Good luck with your illusional superiority.

238
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:07,813
You know the speck can think
anything you want about me you to speak.

239
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:08,681
Wow!

240
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:11,623
I see what's going on here.

241
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:16,395
Morton, no matter how tight
this speck and I get,

242
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,026
the speck could never replace you.

243
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:22,020
I'm only sad that I would have to
explain that at this point.

244
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:26,916
Well, that's awesome Horton.
That really helps.

245
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:31,568
Just try to keep this to yourself.
I'll see you later.

246
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,181
Try.

247
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:40,158
Hey, Horton?
What's you got in there?

248
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,528
What? Nothing.

249
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:43,353
We're not doing anything.

250
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:47,416
Who's we?

251
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:49,213
We? What we?
Did I say that?

252
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:51,057
I just... Oh, no.
I would never say that

253
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:53,890
because that would a play that
I was with someone and not alone.

254
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:02,990
O.K. There is a story
you can't talk to anybody

255
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:03,627
I mean it.

256
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:07,119
If anybody finds out about this,
it could be very very bad.

257
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:09,861
I'm not sure why.

258
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,101
We won't tell anyone.

259
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,124
And if we do, we'll tell them
not to tell anyone.

260
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:17,783
Perfect!

261
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:18,646
O.K.

262
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,701
I'm taking a bath, right.

263
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:21,906
Cause my skin gets kind a dry.
My roof asht

264
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:24,684
While Horton can clean about
the speck that he found

265
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,903
How he'd save this what at really drowned.

266
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:29,053
The Mayor set off
on his morning commute

267
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,789
and noticed things
not quite the same on his route.

268
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:34,630
But please don't blame Horton
for he didn't know

269
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,866
That a swamp pump a bub

270
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:39,465
I do it in the water like this

271
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:42,900
Was a big bub flew.

272
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,324
Hey, Joe! Don't work too hard!

273
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,562
Ah! These luxery condos
they have gone themselves.

274
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:56,634
Hey, you look at that.
I guess they do build themselves.

275
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:59,802
Oh~Kei, that happened.

276
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,354
Now the Mayor knew it was his job

277
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:07,782
to convey the unusual things
that he noticed that day.

278
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,581
There was one problem.

279
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:11,712
Though his will was strong

280
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:13,708
- You are late.
- Thank you Miss. Yelp.

281
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,255
Nothing in Whoville had ever gone wrong.

282
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,915
We have all happy be
with all the we've got.

283
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,540
We like it in here Whoville.
We like it a lot.

284
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:29,718
We're all very busy with
Who-Centennial's coming up. So,..

285
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:32,255
Let's break this meeting to order.

286
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:36,427
Mr. Mayor I presume you have
some good news for us.

287
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:40,121
Well, it's news. I don't know.

288
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:43,444
If we need to go label it good or bad
anything like that

289
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:48,807
The thing is I have noticed
some odd goings on in Whoville lately

290
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:50,946
Good on goings on?

291
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,932
Well, you know.
Tremors, clouds surly in the sky.

292
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:58,522
And it seems to me just be safe,
we might wanna consider...

293
00:19:58,557 --> 00:19:59,662
Pospo nin th WhoCentenia?

294
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:01,397
Consider what?

295
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:03,823
Pospo nin th WhoCentenia?

296
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:06,891
What?!
Speak up, man!

297
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:10,844
Postponing the Who-centennial, alright?

298
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:36,358
We're about to celebrate 100 years
of Whoville happiness in harmony.

299
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:38,803
And you want to postpone the celebration?

300
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,097
Well, what if Whoville's not safe.

301
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,357
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville!

302
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,230
Never has and never will!

303
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:48,561
You bloodly boob!

304
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:50,208
Boob.

305
00:20:53,421 --> 00:20:56,832
The Who-centennial will proceed as planned!

306
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:00,541
The Mayor was really being an idiot.

307
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:03,795
It will be all smile from now on.

308
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:12,173
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.

309
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,580
What? What you mean it don't look like me?

310
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:16,058
That look just like me.

311
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:19,176
Ten years ago...
Wait a minute, hold on for a second.

312
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,674
Treats me like an idiot?

313
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:26,651
I'm not an idiot.

314
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,458
Do I look like an idiot?

315
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:34,638
- You don't want me to answer that.
- I'm not an idiot.

316
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:37,997
That's nerve call me a boob?

317
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:39,563
I would never call somebody a boob.

318
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:40,611
He is a boob.

319
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,766
Look at you, Yak.

320
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:45,804
Look at your face.

321
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:46,798
And I bet.

322
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,724
You don't look so good with this
staple on your head!

323
00:22:00,142 --> 00:22:00,871
Wow!

324
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:02,478
Wa-ha-au!

325
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:07,699
- Thank you, Miss. Yelp.
- You're welcome.

326
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,624
Oh!

327
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:11,400
Hellow?

328
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:14,094
Who's you that?
I'll go out punch you.

329
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,811
Hellow?

330
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,992
Hellow?

331
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:38,669
Who's there?

332
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:40,938
I'm... This the Mayor.

333
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:42,236
The Mayor?

334
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:43,681
The Mayor?

335
00:22:44,257 --> 00:22:45,870
Uh, look at this Mayor!

336
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:48,733
I knew it.

337
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,540
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.

338
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:52,350
There's life on this speck.

339
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:54,125
The speck?
What speck?

340
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:56,345
Well, Am...

341
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:59,082
I don't exactly know
how to tell you this. But...

342
00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:02,216
You're living on a speck.

343
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:05,061
Well, I ee hate to disagree with you.

344
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:07,038
Oh, voice from the drain pipe.

345
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:09,333
But, I live in Whoville.

346
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:11,141
Well, then the Whoville is a speck.

347
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:16,036
Right. O.K. Seriously.
Who is this?

348
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:18,276
Is this Bert from accounting?

349
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:20,670
No. This is Horton.

350
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:21,814
I'm an elephant.

351
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:26,339
O.K. Horton, fake name.

352
00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:27,639
Where are you?

353
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,068
Well, from where you standing?

354
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:31,371
I guess I'm...

355
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,472
in the sky.

356
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,001
Compare to you I'm enormous

357
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:38,863
which is saying something
because I slim down quite a bit I swim.

358
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:43,941
Your whole world fits on
a flower in my world.

359
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,052
Oh, man, this is even inclusion for you Bert.

360
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:48,359
Don't believe me?

361
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,472
Watch what happen
when I put you in the shade

362
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:53,377
- This is absolutly impossi...
- Dark.

363
00:23:54,822 --> 00:23:55,565
Light.

364
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,981
Dark.

365
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:58,692
Light.

366
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:02,046
- Dark, light, dark, light... Dark!
- Wow!

367
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:04,473
- Light!
- Uooo

368
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:06,321
Don't you see?

369
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:10,592
We're in the middle of some kind of
amazing cosmic convergence.

370
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:13,134
Two vastly different worlds.

371
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,348
Miraculously crossing path!

372
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:17,074
Mine colossal!

373
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:18,159
Yours miniscule.

374
00:24:18,194 --> 00:24:21,111
Yet, somehow we've managed to make contact.

375
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:24,511
If you think about it,
it's pretty amazing.

376
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,459
Is everything O.K. down there?

377
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:32,758
Oh. I.. I don't know.

378
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:34,193
You tell me...

379
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:36,167
You're the one holding the speck.

380
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:38,704
I'm the one holding the speck.

381
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:41,213
I'm the one holding the speck...

382
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,205
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.

383
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,176
Am

384
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:47,031
Hold, please.

385
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:50,750
What on all this mean?

386
00:24:50,785 --> 00:24:52,390
The Mayor haven't the clue.

387
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:54,925
So he went to the office of Dr. Larue.

388
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:57,900
Brainiest brain on the staff at Who you.

389
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:59,225
Dr. Larue!

390
00:25:00,404 --> 00:25:02,604
Oh, this is crazy.

391
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,804
Oh, Mr. Mayor.

392
00:25:05,785 --> 00:25:07,334
Ah, how may I be a assistance?

393
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,958
I don't know. Hey.

394
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:09,959
You know I just wondering...

395
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:13,066
If our world was a tiny speck

396
00:25:13,452 --> 00:25:14,838
floating to space,

397
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,169
how would we know?

398
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:17,982
Oh, why would you ask something like that?

399
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,096
Oh, no reason, no reason at all.

400
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:22,175
I don't even remember.
Yes I do.

401
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,474
You know what?

402
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:25,450
Some guy was talking to me

403
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:28,036
not an elephant in the sky,
a guy on the ground

404
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:30,554
Ah, there would be several ramifications

405
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:32,473
Good ramifications?

406
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:35,137
A tiny speck.

407
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:37,379
Uh-huh, yeah, tiny speck.

408
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:39,545
Floating around...

409
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:42,950
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors.

410
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,976
Dramatic changes in the weather.

411
00:25:46,618 --> 00:25:50,448
And if we didn't eventually achieve
some sort of stability

412
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:54,295
our world would be destroyed

413
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:55,694
Destroyed!

414
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:59,873
Destroyed, oh destroyed.

415
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,425
Horton?

416
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:10,710
Ah, no. This is Danny.
Horton is busy right now.

417
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:14,845
I'm joking. That's me.

418
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:16,397
Ah, we're doomed.

419
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:18,061
Listen, Horton!

420
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,482
Turns out I need your help a little bit.

421
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:23,209
Apparently if that speck
keeps moving around,

422
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:25,759
our whole world
could be obliterated.

423
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:27,260
So...

424
00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:33,119
I need you to find us, The Who's,
a safer, more stable home and fast

425
00:26:33,263 --> 00:26:34,750
No problem, Mr. Mayor.

426
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:35,862
Let's see...

427
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,232
Wow!

428
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:41,133
That's a nice view.

429
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,673
Hello, is everything ok?

430
00:26:55,672 --> 00:26:57,043
What's going on up there?

431
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:14,877
This entire jungle is a house of death!

432
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:16,314
Oh, wait.

433
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,625
There's a good spot.

434
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:21,355
And it's when Horton saw
at the top of mount Nool

435
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,662
a small cave that looked peaceful and quiet, and cool,

436
00:27:24,697 --> 00:27:27,935
where a sun flower grew
proud and tall from the ground.

437
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,746
There he knew every Who would be safe,

438
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:31,966
would be sound.

439
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:33,836
I found it Mayor.

440
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:35,990
The perfect place.

441
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,763
Right up there.

442
00:27:38,347 --> 00:27:40,696
- On the top of the mount Nool
- Mr. Mayor?

443
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:42,349
- Yeah?
- I wish we could...

444
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:45,709
Oh-ho, Ah, Shiny. Ah-ha.

445
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:49,366
The Who-centennial Committee is waiting for you

446
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,042
to look over the giantly bar
for the edible parade.

447
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:55,341
Oh, and then you will do at the dinners
for your Whowill Canal.

448
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:59,423
You know, sticking Who in front of everything,
doesn't make it hurt less.

449
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:00,856
Just waste time!

450
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:03,542
I don't wanna go.

451
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:06,688
Listen, Horton. I got to go.

452
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:09,143
Apparently there's a problem with the meatball.

453
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:11,950
You just take care of that meatball, Sir.

454
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:14,639
And leave the freaking out to me.

455
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:17,604
So, then Horton began his long paraless track

456
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:20,735
determined to save the small world on the speck.

457
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,648
Horton was faithful and soul working kind.

458
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:26,022
I got ya.

459
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,763
He was a brave hero.

460
00:28:28,296 --> 00:28:29,254
I'll protect ya.

461
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:30,817
At least in his mind.

462
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:33,426
We must become invisible.
Travel silently.

463
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:36,187
For there are forces
that would seek to destroy us.

464
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,200
Hee-Ha-Ah-aaaaa-Ah!

465
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:42,807
Ah-A?!

466
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:45,442
So, you think you can stick upon me, Huh!

467
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,491
E- Yab! Ah-Dadada!

468
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:50,657
It's clear that you're no match for my ticky kei!

469
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,641
Oh. Ha-a.

470
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,742
I see you have mastered
the way of the snaping branch.

471
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:57,121
Watch me tumble!

472
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:00,759
Horton! Let's go!

473
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:04,043
Mother Kangaroo has monkeys.

474
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:05,455
I wll make monkeys of these monkeys.

475
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,122
It is their destiny, Huh-Uh!

476
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,993
Hoi-Yat! My Tumble!
My Tumble!

477
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:14,253
- Oh
- Horton is the Greatest Hero of them all, Ha!

478
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,690
Horton! Horton! Go!

479
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:18,881
Ah... Hu!

480
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:20,803
Oh, mount Nool is that way!

481
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:21,999
Hahaha!

482
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:23,430
To the top of the mount Nool.

483
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:25,401
As fast as lightning.

484
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:26,537
Ha-it!

485
00:29:27,604 --> 00:29:29,068
Oh, sorry little fella.

486
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,022
You'll be fine.

487
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,418
Just the killing thoughts.

488
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:38,234
- Horton!
- Horton!

489
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:39,444
- Look!
- Go go go!

490
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:44,291
We've all got own clovers
with worlds on them.

491
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:45,358
Yeah!

492
00:29:45,393 --> 00:29:46,391
Oh!

493
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:50,131
In my world everyone's pony

494
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:53,935
and they all eat rainbows
and poop butterflies

495
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:57,717
That's beautiful, Katie.

496
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,860
In a really weired way.

497
00:30:03,895 --> 00:30:05,506
My world is called Jessicaland

498
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:08,658
Everyone worships queen Jessica
because Jessica is so beautiful.

499
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:11,957
Jessica, that was awesome.

500
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:16,973
Rudy?

501
00:30:17,008 --> 00:30:17,706
Mom, be careful!

502
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,657
My best friend Daddly Cons on there.

503
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,574
- Rudy, no one lives on this.
- What?

504
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,469
It's not possible.

505
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:25,235
That Horton is a menace.

506
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,118
Mom, Mom, please.
You're so weird.

507
00:30:27,153 --> 00:30:29,070
- Don't do this to me.
- Honey, go to your room.

508
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:30,370
Horton!

509
00:30:33,818 --> 00:30:35,270
It's good.

510
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:37,308
What do you think you're doing?

511
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:39,110
Ha, you guys are in trouble.

512
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:41,684
Have you forgotten what we discussed?

513
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:44,572
Oh, no. I'm an elephant.
And elephants never forget.

514
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:45,931
It's a curse, really.

515
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:47,192
I remember I was on my head.

516
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:48,341
And you said, and I looked up.

517
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:49,421
And you said what are you doing?

518
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:50,697
And I said the thing about the speck.

519
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:51,932
Then you pulled my ears.

520
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,677
- And you pulled my fore head.
- Horton!

521
00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:54,986
What? You did.

522
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:57,196
Give me that clover, Horton.

523
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:58,485
Now.

524
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,769
No!

525
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:05,558
No?

526
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:07,643
Yeah.

527
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:11,347
Are you sure you wanna
fight this fight, Horton?

528
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:16,046
Because I promise you it will
get very ugly, very fast.

529
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:18,338
And you need to ask yourself.

530
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:21,782
Do I really wanna put myself through this?

531
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:23,817
For a clover?

532
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,804
Take it from me, Horton.

533
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:27,447
You don't.

534
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:29,357
So, hand it over.

535
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:35,096
No! I can't give it to you.

536
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,462
There are people on this speck.

537
00:31:37,494 --> 00:31:39,373
Granted they're very small people.

538
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:40,913
But a person's a person.

539
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,701
No matter how small.

540
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,392
You just crossed the line, Horton.

541
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,990
And I'm gonna make you pay.

542
00:31:58,222 --> 00:31:59,909
That Horton is a menace.

543
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:02,717
He has those kids using their imagination.

544
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,849
It's sick.

545
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:04,743
Alright.

546
00:32:04,778 --> 00:32:08,626
I got to get this speck
up to the top of mount Nool ASAP.

547
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:09,806
Whatever that means.

548
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:13,161
Probably act sweetly awesome peckidom.

549
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:15,217
I mean, how hard can that be?

550
00:32:20,991 --> 00:32:25,336
It's just the straight plumit to certain death.

551
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:27,645
This looks...

552
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,329
kind a precarious.

553
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:31,840
Well...

554
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,368
No need to worry.

555
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:35,430
Obviously when they build a bridge like this

556
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:38,500
they take into account
that elephants will be crossing here.

557
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:42,108
Alright. Feel good.

558
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:44,401
I'll just get... Woo Waaa

559
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:45,646
Woo...

560
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:50,122
Uh-Eee

561
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:52,554
Ah-Eee

562
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:05,781
COURAGE
Woo-uh, That's true.

563
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:14,581
Alright.

564
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,473
Hello and how are we today, Mr. Mayor?

565
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:22,265
Say Aaah

566
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:23,930
Ah!

567
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:24,968
OHK!

568
00:33:32,972 --> 00:33:34,204
Linch, please.

569
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,750
Eh, I think a few of this boards
could stand to be replaced.

570
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:46,652
Uh!

571
00:33:49,181 --> 00:33:50,068
Uh!

572
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:53,607
I just need to think light.

573
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:56,021
I'm light as a feather.

574
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:59,149
I'm light as a feather.

575
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:07,160
Heavy feather.

576
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:09,072
Ok...

577
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:12,896
- This will just pinch a little.
- Ahaa

578
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:14,773
I'm lighter than a feather.

579
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:16,471
What's lighter than a feather?

580
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,300
Ha-ah! Air!

581
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,302
There's nothing lighter.

582
00:34:21,388 --> 00:34:23,532
So, it stands to reason...

583
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:27,072
that the more air I have,

584
00:34:28,702 --> 00:34:29,921
the lighter

585
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:32,879
I'll be.

586
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,114
Next, please.

587
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,431
Alright. It was absolutely terrifying.

588
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:21,824
If I just pull myself up

589
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,587
trying not to panic.

590
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:39,641
UH-AH-AH~!

591
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:42,230
Hm.

592
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:46,188
Hu.

593
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:48,276
That could've been a disaster.

594
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:52,880
Wow.

595
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:54,650
I feel really good right now.

596
00:35:55,177 --> 00:35:56,721
It is my new sense of purpose.

597
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:22,513
Uh-alright!

598
00:36:24,507 --> 00:36:27,197
Hey! JoJo, I need your help.
Can you help me?

599
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:28,285
O.K. Great.

600
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,867
O.K. First. I need you go to the girls room.

601
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:33,977
Take down the hall collection,
and then...

602
00:36:34,012 --> 00:36:35,196
Stop looking into my arm.

603
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:36,794
Put away light bulb collections, and then

604
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:40,388
you know what? Just take of
anything that might break or shatter.

605
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:43,896
Ok, take a good long look.

606
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:45,333
Got it?

607
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:46,695
Thanks, JoJo.

608
00:36:57,055 --> 00:36:58,076
Here.
I'll take that.

609
00:36:58,361 --> 00:36:59,193
and that

610
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,478
Oh Yaaa!

611
00:37:06,754 --> 00:37:08,628
Hi! You're home late.

612
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:10,564
Oh, sorry Hon, I was just...

613
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:15,508
- having some dental works on my arm
- So, what was that?

614
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:16,400
Nedd!

615
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:19,809
What are you doing?

616
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:22,046
Wa- What do you mean?

617
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:25,143
Well, I'm no detective, Nedd.
But you are hanging from the chandelier.

618
00:37:25,178 --> 00:37:26,446
I just thought it might look better

619
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:29,701
somewhere it can't fall on us
and crashes our sleep.

620
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:34,117
What is going on?

621
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:39,387
Hey, Hon...

622
00:37:41,668 --> 00:37:45,944
Did you ever get the feeling
that you're being watched?

623
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:49,072
Am... Ya, sure.

624
00:37:49,564 --> 00:37:50,453
I suppose.

625
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:55,857
And then you get feeling that
maybe that thing watching you is... Ah...

626
00:37:56,397 --> 00:37:57,508
A giant elephant?

627
00:37:58,221 --> 00:37:59,686
Am..

628
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:04,726
You know, how you get that weird feeling
that your world is actually a tiny speck?

629
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:09,109
And that the elephant
that I talked about earlier

630
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:11,137
he's carrying it around on a flower.

631
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:15,537
And you realize that if you tell anybody,
they think you are crazy...

632
00:38:15,572 --> 00:38:20,529
But you still feel the responsibility
to keep everyone safe.

633
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,163
You know that feeling?

634
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,464
Am...

635
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,552
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.

636
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,824
Do you know that feeling?

637
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:33,231
No.

638
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,589
Yarn!

639
00:38:35,624 --> 00:38:39,268
Wow! I am beat.
Time to hit the hey, I guess.

640
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:42,766
Sweetheart,
I know you're under a lot of stress.

641
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:47,720
And if you're seeing elephants
and flowers, then fine.

642
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:50,343
Just don't tell anyone else that story.

643
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:52,156
Ok? And remember...

644
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:53,848
It's not the end of the world.

645
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:57,853
The end of the world?

646
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:02,728
Horton, the Mayor. Horton, the Mayor.
Come in Mayor, over.

647
00:39:04,896 --> 00:39:06,047
Horton?

648
00:39:07,737 --> 00:39:09,528
I get terrible reception here.

649
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:10,742
How about this?!

650
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:13,577
If I get all broll course?!
Can you hear me?!

651
00:39:16,614 --> 00:39:18,975
Yeap! Roger that!

652
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,164
Are we at that safe place yet?

653
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,436
Almost.

654
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:24,692
I'm pretty sure the worst parts' over.

655
00:39:24,908 --> 00:39:26,470
This is your elephant speaking.

656
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:30,614
Just sit back, enjoy the ride
and we all happy to mount Nool in no time.

657
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:32,539
No, you can't have ice cream.
Go back there.

658
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:34,490
Who's there?

659
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:38,926
Is there someone else there?
Well, that's my wife and kids

660
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,489
You have a family.

661
00:39:40,524 --> 00:39:41,787
I do indeed.

662
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:46,851
A beautiful wife, 96 daughters,
and one son.

663
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:48,379
Hohohoho, busy guy.

664
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:51,624
And we all share one bathroom.
You know what that is.

665
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,309
Yeah. Don't I know it.

666
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,259
Bathroom?

667
00:39:56,499 --> 00:39:57,262
Nedd?

668
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:01,403
- What?
- Sweetheart. You know you're on the roof, right?

669
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:05,275
What's that? No, you need to go to bed.
Daddy's having a break down.

670
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,564
Ned? What are you up to now?

671
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,402
I was just about to put the kids to bed,

672
00:40:09,437 --> 00:40:10,579
when I got off the roof.

673
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,937
And I, that's the, that's what happened, right.

674
00:40:30,285 --> 00:40:31,946
- Daddy?
- Yes?

675
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:34,921
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Of course.

676
00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:41,874
- Me too, me three, me four...
- Ok.

677
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:49,533
Hey, JoJo! Wow.

678
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:53,507
Liquid, lot of liquid.
Just the person I wanted to see.

679
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:58,964
Yeah. I've realize that we have not
been seeing eye to eye lately.

680
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,285
and most of it is my fault.
It's true.

681
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,536
You know what I've been trying to do?

682
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:08,014
I have been trying to impose
my vision of your future on you.

683
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:10,433
Let me make this perfectly clear

684
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:15,125
JoJo, you can be
whatever kind of Mayor you wanna be.

685
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,324
Hands on, strong and silent,
outspoken, it's up to you.

686
00:41:19,464 --> 00:41:21,021
Well, good

687
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:22,598
I hear so much better.

688
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:26,228
I am expecting big things
from you, youngman. Big things!

689
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,599
Alright. Good night.

690
00:41:28,657 --> 00:41:30,637
Good stop! Good talk.

691
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:51,581
Then, JoJo snuck out feeling lonely and sad,
and tragically misunderstood by his dad.

692
00:42:07,953 --> 00:42:10,184
And where was he going
at such a late hour night?

693
00:42:13,352 --> 00:42:17,063
Up to Whoville's abandoned star study tower.

694
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,942
A place where the boy felt contented, free.

695
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:23,868
A place he could be what he wanted to be.

696
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:29,882
And what was inside there,
I'd say if I could.

697
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:33,477
But up above, the Kangaroo was up to no good.

698
00:42:41,229 --> 00:42:42,927
Can I come out now, Mom?

699
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:45,015
No, Rudy. Stay in the room.

700
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,069
- But, Mom?
- Stay inside.

701
00:42:58,344 --> 00:43:00,573
Mr. Vlad-I-Koff?

702
00:43:13,031 --> 00:43:14,831
Eating, go.

703
00:43:14,866 --> 00:43:16,789
Yes. I realize you're busy.

704
00:43:16,824 --> 00:43:19,172
But I need your help.

705
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:20,498
It's Horton.

706
00:43:20,777 --> 00:43:23,441
He's become obsess with a clover.

707
00:43:23,444 --> 00:43:27,129
And he actually thinks
there are little people on it.

708
00:43:29,549 --> 00:43:31,535
I want that clover destroyed.

709
00:43:31,648 --> 00:43:33,717
Sure, what a big deal this is.

710
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:35,147
For you, bro.

711
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:38,905
I'd do it myself.
But being a lady,

712
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,521
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

713
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:44,801
But I hear you have no problem with that.

714
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:47,110
No.

715
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:49,232
No problem.

716
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:50,877
Easy busy.

717
00:43:51,084 --> 00:43:52,041
But...

718
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,587
I will only do this for a price.

719
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:57,584
In exchange for a brand new pair of...

720
00:43:58,267 --> 00:43:59,295
No.

721
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,699
- This...

722
00:44:01,936 --> 00:44:04,151
- little kangaroo.
- Mom?!

723
00:44:04,297 --> 00:44:05,284
Quiet, Rudy.

724
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:07,343
Momy is thinking it over.

725
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,051
We'll thanks but, on a second thought

726
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:16,707
I think I'm going to have the Wickersham Brothers
take care of this for me.

727
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:19,922
Yeah, of course, Wickersham
I mean they're classy operation.

728
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,441
You know, they'd... Wait! No!

729
00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:22,890
You can't go over Wickersham.

730
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:27,003
No No. No no no.
Wickershams would be perfect for this job.

731
00:44:27,173 --> 00:44:30,940
But, they are monkeys.
He's not scary.

732
00:44:30,975 --> 00:44:34,707
Ah, thanks anyway.
Maybe next time.

733
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:35,608
Wait!

734
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:39,245
Here is what I will do
the precious clover.

735
00:44:39,485 --> 00:44:40,769
I will take it.

736
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,184
I will crush it.

737
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:45,982
And I will devour it.

738
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:55,305
Bigger than it looked. One second.

739
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:59,084
Oly moly.

740
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:06,593
Then I will regurgitate it.

741
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,561
Then...

742
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:10,620
I mean I devour it second time.

743
00:45:10,884 --> 00:45:12,888
So two times devour.

744
00:45:13,415 --> 00:45:14,971
Sounds nice.

745
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:17,842
But I think I'll talk to the Wickershams.

746
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,733
Wait.

747
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:21,791
Here is best part.

748
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:24,071
I do all

749
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,711
Gratis.

750
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:28,969
That's free bro.

751
00:45:29,966 --> 00:45:31,058
What do you think?

752
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:38,232
- Deal.
- Yes. Score. Thanking you.

753
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,691
You won't regret.

754
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:16,463
Mayor?

755
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:18,110
Mayor?

756
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:20,405
Open up, Mr. Mayor!

757
00:46:20,774 --> 00:46:22,037
Mr. Mayor!

758
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:26,300
It's snowing in the summer!

759
00:46:31,243 --> 00:46:32,081
Yes.

760
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:33,518
Yes, it is.

761
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:35,986
It's a dramatic change in the weather.

762
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:38,385
As if we're on a speck floating to space.

763
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,005
I don't know how you knew.
But, somehow you did.

764
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:47,533
And Whoville is headed for disaster.

765
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,298
- Oh, Horton.
- What?

766
00:46:50,563 --> 00:46:52,593
Ah, nothing. I'm on it.

767
00:46:52,628 --> 00:46:55,400
It's up to us to save the people of Whoville.

768
00:46:59,732 --> 00:47:01,279
Snow is not lucky.

769
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,403
That's not... Stop.

770
00:47:06,474 --> 00:47:08,283
Ok. Anybody else?

771
00:47:08,908 --> 00:47:09,606
Good.

772
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:13,952
No no. Don't join it.
This is not fun.

773
00:47:13,987 --> 00:47:15,551
Uh, this is sign of doomed.

774
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:20,569
Oh, sweety, that's.
No. No no no.

775
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,781
They took. they took.

776
00:47:24,182 --> 00:47:27,025
Stop having fun immediately!

777
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,326
This is dangerous.

778
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:29,715
Ok.

779
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:41,635
Horton?

780
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:42,951
Uh? What?

781
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:51,659
Hey, there.

782
00:47:52,777 --> 00:47:54,012
We're in big trouble down here.

783
00:47:54,047 --> 00:47:56,998
It's happening.
It's snowing in the middle of summer.

784
00:47:57,033 --> 00:47:58,343
It's end of the world!

785
00:48:02,117 --> 00:48:02,887
Hold on here.

786
00:48:03,032 --> 00:48:05,010
I think I know what your problem is.

787
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,049
There, get better?

788
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,461
That seems you have worked.

789
00:48:23,128 --> 00:48:25,620
Eh-uh. Do I smell peanuts?

790
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:27,776
Yes, they are my favorite snack.

791
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:29,485
But they tender linger.

792
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,428
Ohho! K-Uh. Debrick, No.

793
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:39,016
Oh-O. Hang on Mr. Mayor.

794
00:48:39,328 --> 00:48:40,429
I may have to put up a flight.

795
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,758
Frightened elephant can be very dangerous.

796
00:48:43,324 --> 00:48:44,083
Alright!

797
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:46,949
You come down the under, buddy.

798
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,693
You hungry for trouble?

799
00:48:48,728 --> 00:48:50,536
I don't know how you can easy self by.

800
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:51,744
Take a fight.

801
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:56,213
I hate running.

802
00:48:56,422 --> 00:48:57,321
Morton!

803
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:01,342
- Don't do that!
- Horton!

804
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:05,093
Horton? Don't...
There you are.

805
00:49:05,128 --> 00:49:07,695
We got trouble. Wait. Stay. Wait.
Can you hear that?

806
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:10,448
No I'm here. Ok. Listen.
No, go.

807
00:49:10,483 --> 00:49:13,038
Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.

808
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:16,085
She's telling everyone that
you should be kicked out of Nool.

809
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,154
She said that?

810
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,711
I thought we're friends.

811
00:49:18,746 --> 00:49:20,815
Where is she'e gone to Vlad's.

812
00:49:21,075 --> 00:49:24,387
Vlad. Vlad.
I know two Vlads.

813
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:28,271
Is it the bad Vlad or the bunny Vlad
that makes the Cookies?

814
00:49:28,505 --> 00:49:32,049
Yeah, Horton.
She's sending you a bunny with cookies.

815
00:49:32,084 --> 00:49:35,045
I think we can assume it's not bad Vlad.

816
00:49:35,337 --> 00:49:36,541
Yeah, that's good call.

817
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:41,906
So, unless you're cool
with giant razor sharp claws,

818
00:49:41,941 --> 00:49:43,771
There be not fights up your body,

819
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:45,847
If I give her the clover.

820
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:46,975
I can't.

821
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:48,848
I promised the Mayor.

822
00:49:49,242 --> 00:49:51,535
I meant what I said.
I said what what I meant.

823
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,473
And an elephant's faiths were 100%.

824
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:59,878
Please, for me, just this once,
be faithful 99% of the time.

825
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,011
I've never gone 99% on anything.

826
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:04,074
I think I'm awesome.
So come on.

827
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:08,173
I meant to what I said
and I said what I meant.

828
00:50:08,607 --> 00:50:09,669
I'm gonna say it.

829
00:50:10,837 --> 00:50:12,723
You can that all days it's not happen then.

830
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,577
- An elephant's faithful 100%.
- That's right.

831
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:19,066
That's my code. My motto.

832
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:20,683
But thanks for the worning.

833
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,829
Motto. O.K.

834
00:50:23,193 --> 00:50:28,463
But watch the skies.
Keep watching the skies.

835
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:36,159
Mayor, you need to get
everyone on the ground, now.

836
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:38,607
- Two, Three, four...
- I wanna sound the alarm.

837
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,982
There's a good possibility we maybe attacked
by a giant cannibalous bird.

838
00:50:43,017 --> 00:50:43,850
Waht?

839
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:46,387
There's small chance
it could be bunny with cookies.

840
00:50:46,422 --> 00:50:47,816
But, I wouldn't count on it.

841
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:51,719
- Oh, they are formidable words.
- Ya

842
00:50:51,945 --> 00:50:52,721
Are you there?

843
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:56,530
Ya, no. That's a great idea.
It just...

844
00:50:56,565 --> 00:51:00,931
in order to get everyone mobilized
I need the O.K. of the city council.

845
00:51:00,966 --> 00:51:03,613
And they never listen to me.

846
00:51:03,648 --> 00:51:06,829
I've been called boob.
Several times.

847
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:09,261
- I can't do it.
- You have to talk to them, Mayor.

848
00:51:09,296 --> 00:51:10,764
O.K. Listen.

849
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:13,882
Bad Vlad.

850
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:15,628
Bad Vlad.

851
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:18,088
Bad Vlad!

852
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:27,373
That is definitely not a bunny.

853
00:51:35,422 --> 00:51:36,273
Lost him.

854
00:51:36,856 --> 00:51:39,018
Mean to lose him.
And I lost him.

855
00:51:45,071 --> 00:51:46,852
This tree for real, come on!

856
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:49,855
Hang on, Whoville!
This is gonna get rough!

857
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,213
Now you're going to dead-end.

858
00:52:04,426 --> 00:52:06,084
Get ready for the best.

859
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:10,103
Leave me alone!

860
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:16,918
No! Hold on!

861
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,542
I just know he's gonna
jump out somewhere.

862
00:52:30,577 --> 00:52:31,950
- Hello?
- Ah-Ak!

863
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,893
Chess mate.

864
00:52:54,377 --> 00:52:56,959
Now it's time for me to take clover

865
00:52:56,994 --> 00:52:59,898
and crush all the little people on a two sang...

866
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:02,818
Sorry.
This is where we get off.

867
00:53:06,026 --> 00:53:08,694
Ah, right in the beak!

868
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:11,844
Ah. Cool line.

869
00:53:11,879 --> 00:53:13,801
Usually I can I think
those things to later.

870
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:15,742
- Mayor?
- Ah, Horton.

871
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,412
Are you O.K.?

872
00:53:18,454 --> 00:53:19,108
Ah.

873
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:25,209
Well, more or less.

874
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,655
- What happened? The bird?
- Ya, it attacked me.

875
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:31,416
Mayor, your people are in danger.

876
00:53:32,753 --> 00:53:34,515
You know what, I'm gonna do it.

877
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:38,027
I'm going to go out there.
And tell them what is going on.

878
00:53:38,062 --> 00:53:40,805
Perfect.
Now quick. Get go on.

879
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,175
Hey, Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!

880
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,909
My basement is in the attic.

881
00:53:49,944 --> 00:53:51,573
The science museum is history.

882
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:54,902
- We're lost thousand in this messy.
- What's going on Mr. Mayor?

883
00:53:55,463 --> 00:53:57,851
I'm declaring a state of emergency.

884
00:53:57,886 --> 00:54:01,069
Don't worry. Don't worry.

885
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,788
The Mayor is just being a moron.

886
00:54:04,223 --> 00:54:07,189
No wait.
Whoville is in terrible danger.

887
00:54:07,224 --> 00:54:11,124
Everyone needs get down to the
underground storage area immediately.

888
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:16,174
Time time.
Let's do this democratically.

889
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:21,608
Who wants the joy and glory
and festivity of the Who-centennial

890
00:54:21,643 --> 00:54:23,716
to proceed as planned?

891
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,455
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

892
00:54:26,716 --> 00:54:29,531
And who, like the Mayor,

893
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:33,843
thinks it would be better
to spend the Who-centennial

894
00:54:33,878 --> 00:54:37,596
in an underground storage area?

895
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:39,711
Yeah!

896
00:54:40,817 --> 00:54:43,478
Wait! You got to listen to me.

897
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:46,140
Our whole world could explode.

898
00:54:50,437 --> 00:54:52,697
Much more quickly.

899
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:54,764
And our world wouldn't be that noise.

900
00:54:57,158 --> 00:55:00,413
The people have spoken Mr. Mayor.

901
00:55:00,696 --> 00:55:02,715
You're finished.

902
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:06,743
No one believes you.
No one supports you.

903
00:55:08,399 --> 00:55:12,132
- Horton believes me.
- Horton?

904
00:55:13,275 --> 00:55:15,343
Who's Horton?

905
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:21,297
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky.

906
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:23,892
Don't bother look. He is invisible.

907
00:55:23,927 --> 00:55:26,162
And he is the one risking his life

908
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,090
to get Whoville which by the way

909
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,984
is a speck on a clover just safety.

910
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,529
I can prove it.

911
00:55:44,804 --> 00:55:47,978
Horton's voice comes out of this horn.

912
00:55:52,262 --> 00:55:54,016
Horton!

913
00:55:54,705 --> 00:55:57,844
I have all the Whos gathered in town square.

914
00:55:58,109 --> 00:56:00,457
Let them know you there.

915
00:56:00,826 --> 00:56:01,600
Gee.

916
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:04,936
It's a kind of high pressure situation then.

917
00:56:07,537 --> 00:56:10,039
Wow. I'm really run a blank here.

918
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:11,635
I know.

919
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:16,952
Horton?

920
00:56:17,778 --> 00:56:19,258
Horton, We're waiting.

921
00:56:20,364 --> 00:56:23,676
Time to show everyone
that you exist and...

922
00:56:23,855 --> 00:56:27,396
By extension what a none boob I am.

923
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,038
Wait!

924
00:56:35,438 --> 00:56:40,651
Everyone look at the wind.
What do you think that means?

925
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:45,630
It means, Um, it means...
obviously, uh...

926
00:56:46,346 --> 00:56:49,976
Let's the Kite Flying Race begins!

927
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:11,366
What a perron on you Horton! Ha Ha Ha!

928
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,479
Woo, brain freeze!

929
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,505
Give Me Back

930
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:21,361
- My Speck!
- Not this time, guy.

931
00:58:28,365 --> 00:58:30,870
I'm so sorry that I let you down, but...

932
00:58:31,024 --> 00:58:33,692
this... this is bigger than me.

933
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:36,788
Get the famliy together
and get some where safe.

934
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:38,788
I will!

935
00:58:39,678 --> 00:58:40,624
I believe you.

936
00:58:46,437 --> 00:58:49,210
I've got you now, elephant.

937
00:58:50,729 --> 00:58:52,366
No No No!

938
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,229
Oh, no.

939
00:59:08,307 --> 00:59:09,547
Huk! Eung.

940
00:59:12,154 --> 00:59:16,043
Yeah! Hahahahaha...

941
00:59:16,339 --> 00:59:19,798
AhHahahaha...

942
00:59:33,076 --> 00:59:33,864
Mayor?

943
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:35,948
Anybody there?

944
00:59:39,968 --> 00:59:41,222
Anyone?

945
00:59:42,062 --> 00:59:45,017
But clover by clover by clover he found

946
00:59:45,052 --> 00:59:48,994
But the one that he sought for
was just not around.

947
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:50,668
Mayor?

948
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:54,236
Hellow?

949
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:58,388
And by noon poor Horton
more dead and alive,

950
00:59:58,423 --> 01:00:02,506
Had picked, searched,
and filed up 9005.

951
01:00:03,217 --> 01:00:04,328
Hellow.

952
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,695
Sorry to bother you.

953
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,526
Nobody.

954
01:00:12,128 --> 01:00:13,372
Knock knock.

955
01:00:15,256 --> 01:00:16,931
This is the way you take.

956
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,473
Whos there?

957
01:00:18,712 --> 01:00:22,240
If there were any Whos there,

958
01:00:23,472 --> 01:00:26,856
You get it! Whos there.

959
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:29,800
I can't give up have them with you.

960
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:34,012
All day he looked.
Looked on and on.

961
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:37,547
Till his hope was almost gone.

962
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:40,753
No. No. No. Please No!

963
01:00:40,788 --> 01:00:43,471
Ah~ This is unfair!

964
01:00:48,356 --> 01:00:49,255
But wait!

965
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:53,380
Could this one be the one?
Was all this searching finally done?

966
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:56,702
Ah~ yes, for this was the hour

967
01:00:56,737 --> 01:01:00,199
Horton have found
from the 3 millions flowers.

968
01:01:00,234 --> 01:01:01,125
Mayor?

969
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:04,808
Mayor! I found you!

970
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:08,392
Mayor?

971
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:09,992
Are you there?

972
01:01:10,552 --> 01:01:11,713
Mayor.

973
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:16,960
Mayor!

974
01:01:24,272 --> 01:01:26,007
Mayor, are you there?

975
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,720
Mayor.

976
01:01:36,603 --> 01:01:37,401
Mayor.

977
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:41,260
Mayor.

978
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:47,317
MA-E-Yor!

979
01:01:54,215 --> 01:01:57,283
Ah... no. This is Floyd.

980
01:01:58,177 --> 01:01:59,932
Can I take a message?

981
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:05,361
Mayor!

982
01:02:05,716 --> 01:02:07,582
You're Ou-Kei!

983
01:02:09,669 --> 01:02:12,856
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!

984
01:02:16,505 --> 01:02:17,453
Sorry.

985
01:02:17,488 --> 01:02:19,192
There must have been
rough down there.

986
01:02:19,249 --> 01:02:21,063
I can't believe I found you.

987
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:23,050
You really have me worried.

988
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,755
Say. The Mayor was right!

989
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:29,221
Daddy, daddy, daddy

990
01:02:29,256 --> 01:02:32,622
O.K. I'm alright and so are you.

991
01:02:37,704 --> 01:02:40,022
Citizens of Whoville!

992
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:46,647
I'd like you to meet our friend Horton.

993
01:02:50,412 --> 01:02:52,008
He's going to help us.

994
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:55,952
He-e-v-ham I've got this.

995
01:02:56,053 --> 01:02:58,444
This is the chairman.

996
01:02:58,479 --> 01:03:00,844
Idiot! You're finished in this town.

997
01:03:00,879 --> 01:03:04,472
Is that understood? Finished.
You BOOB!

998
01:03:05,879 --> 01:03:07,291
Huh-uh I'm just joking.

999
01:03:12,254 --> 01:03:13,282
Good one.

1000
01:03:13,804 --> 01:03:15,570
Horton, this is my wife Sally.

1001
01:03:15,605 --> 01:03:18,914
You exist! This means
my husband isn't crazy.

1002
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:21,162
Hooray!

1003
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,196
And... a few of my daughters.

1004
01:03:23,231 --> 01:03:26,841
- Haley, Holy, Hooly, Hilder and Heddy.
- Hi!

1005
01:03:26,876 --> 01:03:30,001
And here is Miss Yelp, my loyal assistant.

1006
01:03:30,036 --> 01:03:33,091
- And here's Dr. Larue.
- You saved us.

1007
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:36,150
And Bert from accounting.
And Mrs. McQuilligan.

1008
01:03:36,185 --> 01:03:39,175
And Mr. Farfoogan
from the Cloogan Farfoogans.

1009
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:41,241
And the oldman in the bathtub.

1010
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:42,806
Let's not overwhelm the poor fella.

1011
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:44,979
He's never gonna remember
all these names.

1012
01:03:45,014 --> 01:03:48,120
Whow. I'll try my best.

1013
01:03:48,712 --> 01:03:49,883
Sally.

1014
01:03:50,068 --> 01:03:50,964
Chairman.

1015
01:03:51,105 --> 01:03:54,243
Haley, Hooly, Holy, Hilder, Heddy.
Miss. Yelp, Dr. Larue,

1016
01:03:54,278 --> 01:03:55,862
Bert from accounting,
Mrs. McQuilligany,

1017
01:03:55,897 --> 01:03:58,096
Mr. Farfoogan of the Cloogan Farfoogans.

1018
01:03:58,131 --> 01:04:00,295
And wasn't there an old guy in a shower?

1019
01:04:00,506 --> 01:04:02,539
- Um, bathtub.
- Oh, Yeah!

1020
01:04:02,574 --> 01:04:04,573
We're all here, Horton.

1021
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,903
And, We ALL believe in you.

1022
01:04:09,335 --> 01:04:11,389
Wow! That's awesome.

1023
01:04:11,424 --> 01:04:14,286
And it's reponsibility I do not take lightly.

1024
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:18,342
I promise you a future that
it's safe, sound, and stable.

1025
01:04:18,553 --> 01:04:23,985
We will create a world where every Who
is indoubt with 3 indelible rights

1026
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,227
To be determined that a later date.

1027
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:32,131
And we will put us back on Mountain Nool
before the end of this a decade.

1028
01:04:36,592 --> 01:04:37,474
Oh!

1029
01:04:38,871 --> 01:04:42,133
This, this is the elephant that is crazy.
Oh my goodness.

1030
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:46,298
I could tell anyone and it's to the kangaroo.

1031
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:47,919
Quick to they find out of them.

1032
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,564
Hoho, you should've been seeing me.

1033
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:52,514
I really read the elephant habit.

1034
01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:57,395
I chase him like doorman and then
I break him into million little elephant pieces.

1035
01:04:58,012 --> 01:05:00,227
It was thing of beauty,
Really my best work.

1036
01:05:00,262 --> 01:05:01,919
Classic Vlad.

1037
01:05:02,042 --> 01:05:04,513
- And the clover?
- Clover is finished.

1038
01:05:04,548 --> 01:05:07,821
No vain million years Horton finds it.

1039
01:05:07,856 --> 01:05:11,095
Believe my beak.
Clover is gone forever.

1040
01:05:16,276 --> 01:05:18,977
I just saw Horton.
And he is still talking to that clover.

1041
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:25,289
Idiot!

1042
01:05:25,324 --> 01:05:26,743
Whoa, come on.

1043
01:05:26,778 --> 01:05:30,173
Hang you, Bro. It's me you're
talking to. We have history.

1044
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:33,802
Come on. Let's don't forget
I did this for Free.

1045
01:05:34,772 --> 01:05:38,304
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?

1046
01:05:38,527 --> 01:05:41,836
There once was a time
when people were people.

1047
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,906
And specks were specks.

1048
01:05:44,601 --> 01:05:50,798
All I say it you can't see it, hear it,
or feel it, it doesn't exist.

1049
01:05:51,413 --> 01:05:54,315
Our way of life is under attack.

1050
01:05:54,545 --> 01:05:56,597
And who's leading that attack?

1051
01:05:56,813 --> 01:05:57,697
Horton!

1052
01:05:57,732 --> 01:06:01,574
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute!

1053
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,074
This is Horton we're talking about
you'll know about him.

1054
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:08,269
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
Except for that fly city he sat on.

1055
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:09,930
He didn't that on purpose.

1056
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:13,751
- Shut up, mouse.
- Oh, Yeah. That's weired.

1057
01:06:13,786 --> 01:06:16,963
I feel my brain is burning.
I got to go.

1058
01:06:17,959 --> 01:06:23,295
Are we going to let troublemakers
like Horton poison the minds of children?

1059
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:24,989
Not the children!

1060
01:06:26,095 --> 01:06:30,590
When Horton tells our children
about worlds beyond the jungle,

1061
01:06:30,676 --> 01:06:32,989
it makes them question authority.

1062
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,382
Which leads to the fires,
which leads to shocking!

1063
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:39,843
Yeah! Horton must pay!

1064
01:06:39,878 --> 01:06:41,419
Eat that speck!

1065
01:06:41,454 --> 01:06:43,480
We have to do something!

1066
01:06:43,515 --> 01:06:47,426
- For the children!
- For the children!

1067
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:51,337
Are we going to let him get away with this?

1068
01:06:51,372 --> 01:06:56,368
No!

1069
01:07:18,884 --> 01:07:22,827
Morton! I told you 100%!

1070
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:23,806
Horton.

1071
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:28,645
- Morton, pick up your feet, Gee.
- It's not me.

1072
01:07:30,137 --> 01:07:33,280
Oh, Hoho. I see. It's an angry mob.

1073
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,703
Sorry Morton.
I thought it's you who's making all the...

1074
01:07:36,738 --> 01:07:37,776
But it's...

1075
01:07:38,451 --> 01:07:39,728
Hold on.

1076
01:07:41,251 --> 01:07:42,766
Run, Horton!

1077
01:07:43,658 --> 01:07:44,773
There he is!

1078
01:07:46,287 --> 01:07:47,489
Let's grab him!

1079
01:07:48,036 --> 01:07:49,338
Let's take him!

1080
01:07:57,322 --> 01:07:59,247
Stop!

1081
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:01,452
Hey, fellas.

1082
01:08:01,694 --> 01:08:02,564
Good to see ya.

1083
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:03,818
All at once.

1084
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,925
You're look really great as herd.

1085
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:11,380
Horton, Horton, Horton look at that mess
you created for yourself.

1086
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:15,774
All this holible lure over us
is silly little flower.

1087
01:08:16,171 --> 01:08:17,598
It's a speck.

1088
01:08:18,067 --> 01:08:18,992
Right.

1089
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:24,624
I mean a silly really all this talk of
roping you and caging you and well

1090
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:27,183
we don't need to go into the details.

1091
01:08:27,392 --> 01:08:32,631
The point is this angry mob
of all a trouble you're in.

1092
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,836
It can all go away.

1093
01:08:37,129 --> 01:08:40,097
- Really?
- Of course.

1094
01:08:40,326 --> 01:08:43,511
All you have to do is admit to everyone

1095
01:08:43,546 --> 01:08:47,463
that there are no little people
living on that speck.

1096
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:51,353
That you're wrong and I was right.

1097
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,350
You do that,

1098
01:08:53,385 --> 01:08:57,732
and things can go the right
back to the way they were.

1099
01:08:57,955 --> 01:09:00,283
But, if you don't,

1100
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:04,691
You're going to have to pay the price.

1101
01:09:11,924 --> 01:09:13,957
So I just have to say it isn't true?

1102
01:09:19,711 --> 01:09:24,001
Go ahead! Rope me! Cage me!
Do whatever you want!

1103
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:26,372
But there are people on this speck.

1104
01:09:26,407 --> 01:09:27,899
And they have a Mayor.

1105
01:09:27,934 --> 01:09:31,002
Who has 96 daughters
and one son name JoJo,

1106
01:09:31,037 --> 01:09:34,070
Who all share a bathroom
whatever that is.

1107
01:09:35,393 --> 01:09:38,365
And even though you can't
hear or see them at all,

1108
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,755
A person's a person,
no matter how small.

1109
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:52,318
That was beautiful, Horton.

1110
01:09:52,677 --> 01:09:54,831
Rope him! Cage him!

1111
01:09:54,866 --> 01:09:59,150
Burn that speck in a pot of
boiling pees on that oil!

1112
01:10:03,256 --> 01:10:04,636
They don't believe we're here.

1113
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,379
We've got to make some noise!

1114
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:09,690
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1115
01:10:09,911 --> 01:10:13,981
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1116
01:10:14,016 --> 01:10:14,924
Come on!

1117
01:10:15,936 --> 01:10:17,060
Everybody!

1118
01:10:18,598 --> 01:10:20,702
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1119
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:33,402
This will take you not to make up stories
about people on specks!

1120
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,647
Listen. There they are!

1121
01:10:39,567 --> 01:10:41,545
- Rope him!
- Cage him!

1122
01:10:41,897 --> 01:10:43,211
It's not working.

1123
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:46,195
I can hear you.
But, their ears aren't strong enough.

1124
01:10:46,405 --> 01:10:48,163
We need to be louder.

1125
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:51,241
Get every Who'd make noise! Everyone!

1126
01:10:51,276 --> 01:10:55,025
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1127
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,931
JoJo, where're you going?

1128
01:10:57,528 --> 01:11:00,707
We need every voice! JoJo!

1129
01:11:03,999 --> 01:11:08,208
You need to make some noise down there.
Or we all be destroyed.

1130
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:12,512
The Mayor grabbed the tamtam
starting to smeck it.

1131
01:11:13,927 --> 01:11:17,225
And all over Whoville,
They ooped up all racket.

1132
01:11:19,406 --> 01:11:22,267
They rattle tin kettles,
they beat on brass pans,

1133
01:11:22,302 --> 01:11:25,092
On garbage fills absonal,
cran berrry cans.

1134
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:28,276
They blew on byzu bilzl
brasstic big tubas.

1135
01:11:28,311 --> 01:11:31,426
On durming Soom-pazum,
Boom-pazum, plutes

1136
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:34,868
There!

1137
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:38,822
Can they hear us now?

1138
01:11:39,214 --> 01:11:40,892
Listen! Please!

1139
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:43,094
It's the most beautiful thing ever!

1140
01:11:43,451 --> 01:11:45,064
I don't hear nothing!

1141
01:11:45,854 --> 01:11:47,039
I don't think so.

1142
01:11:47,222 --> 01:11:48,884
But, keep trying.

1143
01:11:49,636 --> 01:11:52,503
Never give... UP!

1144
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:59,743
Are you sure that every Who
down in Whoville is trying?

1145
01:12:08,071 --> 01:12:09,089
Where's JoJo?

1146
01:12:09,685 --> 01:12:11,752
Probably up the old observatory.

1147
01:12:25,726 --> 01:12:27,115
Hey, there's a limit.

1148
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:37,425
That's not supposed to
strech that far!

1149
01:12:47,177 --> 01:12:48,155
JoJo!

1150
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,480
You built this?

1151
01:13:44,705 --> 01:13:52,728
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1152
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:02,076
You're making a mistake.

1153
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:05,069
Mom!

1154
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:08,495
This doesn't concern you, sweety.
Back in your pouch!

1155
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,413
Everybody, don't stop!

1156
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:20,696
Keep going! This gonna do it!

1157
01:14:25,245 --> 01:14:27,972
- Can they hear?
- No!

1158
01:14:36,278 --> 01:14:39,510
No matter what happens,
I couldn't ask for a better, son

1159
01:14:43,757 --> 01:14:45,465
Ah, hey, JoJo?

1160
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:48,442
Come on! Keep going!

1161
01:14:52,801 --> 01:14:54,814
NO!

1162
01:14:59,183 --> 01:15:03,763
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1163
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:08,276
No-oh-hoU.

1164
01:15:10,009 --> 01:15:14,333
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1165
01:15:14,368 --> 01:15:17,393
NO!

1166
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,654
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1167
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:32,917
I hear it! I hear it!
They are there!

1168
01:15:32,952 --> 01:15:34,011
And that yelp.

1169
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,617
That one small extra yelp put it over.

1170
01:15:37,652 --> 01:15:40,724
And all the Who noises brust out of the clover.

1171
01:15:40,759 --> 01:15:42,456
- I hear it, too.
- Me too, wide.

1172
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:47,858
Rudy. Give me that! Come Ru...

1173
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:53,263
Rudy, get back in the pouch now.

1174
01:15:55,598 --> 01:15:56,788
No, Mom.

1175
01:15:58,217 --> 01:16:01,066
Uh, Wickersams, get that clover.

1176
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:07,581
What the... E.. Anybody take it from him.

1177
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:20,092
You did it, Mayor.

1178
01:16:20,406 --> 01:16:21,713
You did it.

1179
01:16:22,822 --> 01:16:24,468
We did it!

1180
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:29,056
Yeah!

1181
01:16:33,513 --> 01:16:34,999
Well done, son.

1182
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:38,454
Alright, Mayor!

1183
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:41,239
Dad, you're one of the Greats.

1184
01:16:45,395 --> 01:16:48,460
Wow! Easy everyone. Easy!

1185
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:50,854
Oh hi, Vlad.

1186
01:16:55,147 --> 01:16:57,263
Well, I shouldn't. But,

1187
01:17:25,824 --> 01:17:27,863
Oh man, that is nice touch.

1188
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:31,502
I'm a mess with this.
I'm emotional.

1189
01:17:31,537 --> 01:17:33,155
Here come the water slide.

1190
01:17:35,077 --> 01:17:37,071
There is so much people to thank.

1191
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:39,237
The good people of nool

1192
01:17:39,272 --> 01:17:41,378
who put me in a cage
and fork me with sticks

1193
01:17:41,413 --> 01:17:42,500
That was me!

1194
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:45,985
My buddy morton
for being the only who stood by me

1195
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:48,307
Well, not right by me
he hidden in the bushes

1196
01:17:48,404 --> 01:17:49,801
sending me good thoughts.

1197
01:17:49,981 --> 01:17:50,936
He's small.

1198
01:17:50,971 --> 01:17:53,549
Dude, you're a worrier poet.

1199
01:17:53,584 --> 01:17:56,719
And most of all I'd like to thank to
the Mayor of Whoville.

1200
01:17:57,434 --> 01:18:00,805
- Who believed me from the beginning.
- On, Horton.

1201
01:18:01,278 --> 01:18:02,825
We're going to miss you.

1202
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:04,485
Hm-um, Gee

1203
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,836
What are we gonna do without you, Horton?

1204
01:18:06,871 --> 01:18:08,082
Ah, don't worry.

1205
01:18:08,549 --> 01:18:10,027
I always be around.

1206
01:18:10,999 --> 01:18:14,956
- And even as I wonder,
- On~

1207
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:16,447
Keeping in them sight.

1208
01:18:16,641 --> 01:18:19,272
You're a candle in the window.

1209
01:18:19,307 --> 01:18:24,593
- On a cool dark winter's night.
- Beautiful metaphor.

1210
01:18:24,628 --> 01:18:29,879
And I'm getting closer than
I ever thought I might.

1211
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,644
Uh, that's a little high funnys.

1212
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:38,166
Baby, I can't fight this feeling any more.

1213
01:18:38,411 --> 01:18:43,754
I've forgotten what I started fighting for.

1214
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,849
- And if I have to crawl upon your floor.
- Crawl upon the floor.

1215
01:18:47,884 --> 01:18:51,475
- Come crashing through your door.
- Crashing through your door.

1216
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:54,764
Baby I can't fight this feeling any more.

1217
01:18:54,799 --> 01:19:05,407
I can't fight this feeling any more.

1218
01:19:05,442 --> 01:19:09,966
And so all ended well
for those Horton and Whos.

1219
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:13,062
And for all of the jungle, even Kangaroos.

1220
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:16,494
So let that be a lesson to one and to all

1221
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,777
A person's a person.

1222
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,317
No matter how small.
