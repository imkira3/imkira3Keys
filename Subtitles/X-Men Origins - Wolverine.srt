1
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:56,018
- You're always sick.
- You were sick when you were my age.

2
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,359
- Evening, sir.
- Evening, Victor.

3
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:05,689
I didn't realize you were still here.

4
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:10,198
I was just keeping James company, sir,
if that's all right.

5
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,698
Very kind of you.

6
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,637
- Any better, Son?
- Still cold, Father.

7
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,541
Just a mild fever.

8
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,843
- You'll be all right in the morning.
- You always say that.

9
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:25,213
And you always pull through, don't you?

10
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:28,720
- Yeah.
- Now, you taking your medicine?

11
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:33,253
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

12
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,190
- Your father's drunk again.
- Elizabeth!

13
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:40,631
- You should help him home, Victor.
- It's not my name he's calling, sir.

14
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,896
- Father!
- Stay where you are, James.

15
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,869
- Get off me!
- Father!

16
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,034
Now! You never loved him!

17
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,170
I told you never to come back here.

18
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,417
Get out!

19
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:13,489
James?

20
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,095
- No.
- James?

21
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:24,107
- There are things you don't understand.
- Don't.

22
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,803
- I need him to know!
- Please don't.

23
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:27,846
- No more lies.
- James...

24
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,629
- No!
- James!

25
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:56,435
He... He wasn't your father,

26
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:06,114
Son.

27
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,419
What are you?

28
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,809
- I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!
- Yes, you did!

29
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:38,840
He deserved it, and you gave it to him.

30
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,684
We're brothers, Jimmy. You realize that?

31
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,690
And brothers protect each other.

32
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:51,759
You have to be hard now,
hard so nothing can ever touch us.

33
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,389
- I want to go home.
- We can't.

34
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,065
We stick together, no matter what,

35
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,300
and take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

36
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,864
Can you do that, little brother?

37
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,676
- I'm going down to the river.
- They're coming.

38
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:11,580
- Head over the hill. Hurry!
- Can you run?

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,489
- Keep on running and don't look back.
- Okay.

40
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,554
Back to back!

41
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,303
That's enough!

42
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,145
Enough!

43
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,922
No! No!

44
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,998
Stand down, soldier!

45
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,208
Victor!

46
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,780
Stand down! Stand down!

47
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:58,145
Stand down!

48
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:02,847
No!

49
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,882
Ready, aim...

50
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,281
Wake me when it's over.

51
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:44,820
...fire!

52
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:54,235
Freaks! You're animals! Freaks!

53
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,638
My name is Major William Stryker.

54
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,871
You've been charged
with killing a senior officer.

55
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:01,879
Is that correct?

56
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:04,108
Apparently, we have some issues
with authority...

57
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,878
- Just keep a lid on it.
...sir.

58
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,819
The warden tells me that your sentence
was carried out by a firing squad

59
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,754
at 1000 hours.

60
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:15,019
- How'd that go?
- It tickled.

61
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:24,435
You boys tired of running?
Tired of denying your true nature?

62
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,871
- What do you care?
- Oh, I care.

63
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,234
I care because I know how special you are.

64
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,005
How valuable.

65
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:41,251
Look, you can stay here
locked up like freaks of nature,

66
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,184
or you can join me.

67
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,920
I'm putting together a special team
with special privileges.

68
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:54,295
Now, tell me, how would you like
to really serve your country?

69
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,436
You know, I love this weapon

70
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,038
more than any other thing
in the whole wide world.

71
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:13,107
- Do you wanna know why?
- No.

72
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:15,546
It's memorable.

73
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,747
Sure, it's a little bulky,
tough to get on a plane.

74
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,350
You whip out a couple of swords
at your ex- girlfriend's wedding,

75
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,724
they will never, ever forget it.

76
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,626
That's funny, Wade.

77
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:29,064
I think you confuse me
with someone who gives a shit.

78
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,898
Right, it's probably not
as intimidating as having a gun

79
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,872
or bone claws
or the fingernails of a bag lady.

80
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,810
- Manicure?
- Victor. Easy.

81
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,186
Fred got a new tattoo. I'm concerned.

82
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:57,084
Oh, Jesus, Fred,
you just met her last night.

83
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:59,923
- I love her.
- You love her after one night?

84
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:01,625
She's a gymnast.

85
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,901
Bradley, take her down.

86
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,601
Oh, God.

87
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,610
- Are you gonna puke?
- If we were meant to fly,

88
00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:15,475
- we'd grow wings.
- Don't worry, Nancy.

89
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:18,948
- More people die driving than flying.
- How about from impaling?

90
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:22,145
Hey, be nice,
or be your approximation of nice.

91
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,646
- Would you like a bucket?
- No.

92
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:27,885
Gentlemen, wheels down in Lagos in five.

93
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,959
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero?

94
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:17,699
- Intruder! Perimeter breach!
- Man the weapon!

95
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:23,311
Intruder, stop!
Put your hands behind your head!

96
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,369
Having fun yet?

97
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:01,476
- Fred?
- The tank?

98
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,684
- The tank.
- Yeah, I got that.

99
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:44,127
Great. Stuck in an elevator
with five guys on a high- protein diet.

100
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:46,026
- Wade.
- Dreams really do come true.

101
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:47,189
Just shut it!

102
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:50,257
- You're up next.
- Thank you, sir. You look really nice today.

103
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,860
It's the green.
It brings out the seriousness in your eyes.

104
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,897
- Oh, my God. Do you ever shut up, pal?
- No. Not when I'm awake.

105
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,869
Bradley? Top floor, please.

106
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,845
Cover the elevator! The elevator!

107
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,530
Time to go to work.

108
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,196
Okay. People are dead.

109
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:09,208
If you didn't have that mouth on you,
Wade, you'd be the perfect soldier.

110
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:17,050
I wouldn't do that if I was you, brother.

111
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,621
- Take the diamonds. They're yours.
- I don't want your diamonds.

112
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:28,431
I want this.

113
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,135
But that is nothing. A souvenir.

114
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,704
Where did you find it? I want the source.

115
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:41,475
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

116
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:47,577
Tell him this rock is
more valuable to me than his life.

117
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:49,711
Ask him where he found it.

118
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:01,932
Okay.

119
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,899
He says it came from the sky.

120
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,941
He's telling the truth.

121
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:13,607
You don't know the language, Logan.

122
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,805
- It's a meteor fragment.
- I know what it is.

123
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm asking him where he found it.

124
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,874
Sir, base wants to know our location.

125
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:23,216
- Shut them down.
- Yes.

126
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,649
Tell him everyone here will die

127
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,695
unless he tells me
where he found the rock.

128
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,501
- He says that it's sacred.
- Okay, fine.

129
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:48,677
Victor.

130
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,130
Victor!

131
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:12,896
Don't even think about it.

132
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,432
We didn't sign up for this.

133
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:21,603
Put him down!

134
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:35,889
What are you doing?

135
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:39,686
We finally got a good thing going here.
Don't you screw this up.

136
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:41,561
Enough. That's enough.
We've done enough.

137
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,726
Who do you think you are?

138
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,797
This is what we do.

139
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:48,801
Maybe you'd rather be
rotting in a hole somewhere

140
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:52,639
till they figure out a way to do it to us.
Is that it? Huh?

141
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:54,577
I'm done.

142
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,482
You coming?

143
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,420
Jimmy!

144
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:14,263
We can't just let you walk away.

145
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,001
Jimmy!

146
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,208
Jimmy!

147
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,654
Why are you up so early?

148
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,666
Come here.

149
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,798
See you, baby.

150
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,273
Hey.

151
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:15,881
Oh, that's nice. Yes. Take your time.

152
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,048
You're wrapped, man.

153
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,842
Okay, I'm totally gonna get this.

154
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,038
Nope. Come on.

155
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,050
Oh, wow! Let's go on the Ferris wheel.

156
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,552
- How does he do it?
- Come on.

157
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,247
...amazing lady in a box!

158
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,629
Swing the hammer, ring the bell!

159
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,565
Hey, what do you do?

160
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:09,134
If you turn off the light, you win a prize.

161
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:12,904
- Three tries for a buck.
- Come on, I wanna do it.

162
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:15,241
There you go. Okay?

163
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,413
No, that's obvious.

164
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:26,589
That's two.

165
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,428
Well, that's a stupid trick.

166
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,835
It's not a trick, man.

167
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:42,331
Come on. Freak.

168
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,503
Bye.

169
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,505
Show's over!

170
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:23,071
I said show's over!

171
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,544
The show's never over for us, Bradley.

172
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:35,753
- Victor.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

173
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:40,389
Yeah. Come on in.

174
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:57,978
You know, I've never said anything
to anyone about what happened.

175
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:01,241
I'm living a totally
different life now, Victor.

176
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,583
No need to bring up the past.

177
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,202
You know,

178
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,639
I always thought it would
be Wade to come knocking at my door.

179
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,271
Well... Well,

180
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,781
Wade's gone.

181
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:37,413
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

182
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,149
I'm not afraid of dying.

183
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:45,055
How do you know?

184
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:48,527
You've never tried it before.

185
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:07,616
Was it the wars?

186
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:10,519
Which one?

187
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,488
All of them.

188
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,231
- Tell me.
- Hey.

189
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:25,899
It's just a scratch.

190
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:36,236
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

191
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,747
Yeah.

192
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:04,440
Who the hell is this?

193
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:06,476
Smells like government.

194
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:13,115
My God. Haven't aged a day!

195
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:14,708
Clean living.

196
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:19,781
- You remember Agent Zero?
- Still shooting first, asking questions later?

197
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,523
- You still chewing on cheap cigars?
- Boys, please.

198
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,296
- I have a job for you.
- I already have a job.

199
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,494
Lumberjack? 18 grand a year?

200
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:35,005
18.5. Plus I haven't had to kill anyone
in a while.

201
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,063
- Starting to miss it?
- Right about now I am.

202
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:39,439
- Yeah?
- Zero, back to the car.

203
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,481
Attaboy.

204
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:54,388
You know, I'm not proud about
the way things ended between us.

205
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,358
Conversation's over.

206
00:24:57,328 --> 00:25:00,957
Playing <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>
with a schoolteacher,

207
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,162
I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.

208
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,359
And you would know, huh?

209
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:08,330
- I would.
- What do you want, Stryker?

210
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:12,908
Bradley was killed three days ago.

211
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:15,605
Wade before that.

212
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:19,680
I believe that someone is hunting down
our old team.

213
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:24,645
- Anyone else?
- As far as I know, Victor is safe.

214
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:29,221
But whoever it is has names, addresses.

215
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:31,352
I can take care of myself.

216
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:35,561
This is not about you, Logan.

217
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:40,970
Your country needs you.

218
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:43,496
I'm Canadian.

219
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:47,306
I know you, Logan! I know who you are!

220
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:04,817
- Miss Kayla, Miss Kayla, look what I did.
- What did you do?

221
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:18,334
Bye, Miss Silverfox! Bye!

222
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:26,739
What's wrong?

223
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,054
Stryker came by today.

224
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:33,623
Don't worry. I said no.

225
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:36,717
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

226
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:39,126
Because I'm the best there is at what I do,

227
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:40,857
but what I do best isn't very nice.

228
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:44,628
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

229
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:47,569
A gift. You can return a gift.

230
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:02,443
Come on, fellas.

231
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:05,087
All right.

232
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:07,216
Stay in the car.

233
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,919
I'm just gonna ask nicely.

234
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:15,956
You mind letting us go by?

235
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,294
- You in some kind of a hurry there, pal?
- Hey, hey, hey.

236
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:19,666
Are you?

237
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:20,999
Just move your truck so we can go by.

238
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:23,232
We're trying to have
a conversation there, all right?

239
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:25,502
You start something,
you'd better be ready to finish it.

240
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:26,941
Listen...

241
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:29,980
Hey, guys, take it easy! Calm down.

242
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:37,510
- Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.
- I know.

243
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:41,524
Big temper, too. So please let us pass.

244
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:49,690
- Thank you.
- Come on, man, let's go.

245
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,299
How'd you do that?

246
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:55,364
Female powers of persuasion. It's a gift.

247
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:58,840
Oh, I see.
Do you have those powers over me?

248
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:01,776
Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you?

249
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:20,994
Why is the moon so lonely?

250
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:23,492
Why?

251
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,299
Because she used to have a lover.

252
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,770
- You tell this to the kids?
- No.

253
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,775
His name was Kuekuatsheu
and they lived in the Spirit World together.

254
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:35,835
Oh, this is a true story? All right.

255
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:38,643
And every night they would
wander the skies together,

256
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:43,879
but one of the other spirits was jealous.

257
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:47,919
Trickster wanted the moon for himself,

258
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:52,190
so he told Kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers.

259
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:56,597
He told him to come to our world
and pick her some wild roses,

260
00:28:56,867 --> 00:29:00,894
but Kuekuatsheu didn't know
that once you leave the Spirit World,

261
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,573
you can never go back.

262
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:10,445
And every night he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name.

263
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:14,945
But

264
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:19,584
he can never touch her again.

265
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,483
Wow.

266
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:24,556
Koo- koo- ka- choo got screwed.

267
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,022
"Kuekuatsheu."

268
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:36,664
It means "the Wolverine".

269
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:38,927
What you doing, Logan?

270
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:48,371
Kayla.

271
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,854
Oh, God.

272
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:36,187
Kayla!

273
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:43,088
You're not from around here, are you?

274
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:49,798
What gave me away?

275
00:32:51,735 --> 00:32:53,168
Victor!

276
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:58,473
- You got insurance on this place?
- Insurance? No.

277
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:02,539
- Too bad.
- Victor!

278
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:19,959
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

279
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,263
Guys, whatever this is, take it outside.

280
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,805
Why?

281
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:38,312
Why?

282
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,850
You don't call. You don't write.

283
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:50,883
How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

284
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:33,162
I hate to say it, Jimmy, but, frankly,
I'm a little disappointed.

285
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:37,029
Stay down.

286
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:17,544
Tell me something, Jimmy.
Was she worth it?

287
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:40,536
When are you gonna figure it out?

288
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,236
We're not like them.

289
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:47,338
I am nothing like you.

290
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:50,736
Sure, you are.

291
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:54,074
You just don't know it yet.

292
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:11,464
- What do we got?
- Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

293
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:15,696
What is this, a joke? Guy's fine.

294
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:17,000
- Where is he?
- Hey, hey, don't...

295
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,042
- I said, where is he?
- I don't know who he is.

296
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:20,906
I can help you.

297
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,419
Six years I've been here.

298
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:33,252
No one knew me, and then you show up,
and the next day she's dead!

299
00:36:33,323 --> 00:36:34,654
I tried to warn you.

300
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,716
Why didn't you tell me it was Victor?

301
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:39,023
- I didn't know!
- Bullshit!

302
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:45,066
- Why?
- I swear on my son's life, I didn't!

303
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,706
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

304
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:57,770
I had to lock him up.
He felt I betrayed him.

305
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:01,847
Went AWOL.
He said he was coming after all of us.

306
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,516
You didn't come to warn me,

307
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:06,886
you came to save your own ass.

308
00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:09,153
So what's your plan, Captain?

309
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,353
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't!

310
00:37:11,428 --> 00:37:13,828
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

311
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:17,662
I can give you the tools to defeat him.

312
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:23,371
And we can still save the others.

313
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,738
You mean save yourself, right?

314
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,612
I promise you two things.

315
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,910
You will suffer more pain
than any other man can endure,

316
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:35,349
but you will have your revenge.

317
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,053
I come with you, I'm coming for blood.

318
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:45,455
No law. No code of conduct.

319
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:50,099
You point me in the right direction,
you get the hell out of my way.

320
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:33,975
When it starts, whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

321
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:37,771
focus on that. Maybe it will help.

322
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,408
Trust me, I've been through worse.

323
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,247
No, you haven't.

324
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,710
We're ready.

325
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:51,357
We're gonna make you indestructible,
but first we're gonna have to destroy you.

326
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,558
You remember
what we were looking for in Africa?

327
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:00,125
- I remember.
- Well, I found it.

328
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:06,238
It helped us create
a metal compound so strong

329
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:08,971
that you will be able to withstand
virtually anything.

330
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:11,104
It's called Adamantium.

331
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:15,611
I can't put Victor down myself, Logan.

332
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:20,780
To kill him, you're gonna have to embrace
the other side.

333
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:25,222
Become the animal.

334
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:28,989
Let's do this.

335
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:31,093
I almost forgot.

336
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:36,232
I want new ones.

337
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:38,970
What do you want them to say?

338
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:41,467
Wolverine.

339
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:01,129
Generals, welcome.

340
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:04,294
General Munson.

341
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:08,228
Today we're gonna witness
medical history.

342
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,399
- Today we're gonna create Weapon X.
- X?

343
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,070
Roman numeral 10.

344
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:20,713
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton.

345
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:23,352
Let's begin.

346
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,101
- We're brothers, Jimmy.
<i>- Logan!</i>

347
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:14,693
Body temperature, 108 and rising.

348
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,109
Why is he thrashing like that?
Why isn't he sedated?

349
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:23,634
He feels pain just like the rest of us,
but anesthesia won't work on him.

350
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:27,479
- That's why he had to volunteer.
- Heart rate, 190. 195.

351
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,075
- Will he survive this?
- I don't know.

352
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:31,620
200.

353
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:35,183
Son.

354
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:38,087
Heart rate well beyond maximum.

355
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:41,130
- Blood pressure?
- 260 over 180 and rising.

356
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:43,529
He can make it. He can make it.

357
00:41:47,904 --> 00:41:49,132
Victor!

358
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,006
<i>I love you.</i>

359
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,706
<i>You're not an animal.</i>

360
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:05,983
It means "the Wolverine".

361
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,909
Well, I guess he can die.

362
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:08,406
Come on, old friend. Come back.

363
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:13,616
Heart rate rising.

364
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:17,515
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

365
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:20,392
No rejection. Procedure completed.

366
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,028
- We did it.
- We did it.

367
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,295
Yeah! Yes.

368
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:32,397
Are we taking him to the island?

369
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:34,272
The island? No.

370
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:37,879
The bonding works.

371
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:40,211
We'll use his DNA for the XI.

372
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:44,782
Erase his memory.

373
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,020
Erase his memory.

374
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:01,469
I think he heard you.

375
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:18,310
Lock down!

376
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,256
Hunt him down. Take his head off.

377
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:41,368
Travis.

378
00:45:49,145 --> 00:45:54,708
- I think there's a naked man in the barn.
- Yep.

379
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,644
Son?

380
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:30,853
What in hell you doing?

381
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,820
- It's cold.
- Cold.

382
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:41,488
- You got no clothes on.
- Yeah.

383
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:45,563
- You're not on the drugs, are you?
- No.

384
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,599
- No, just had a rough night.
- Yeah, you could say that.

385
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:55,834
Come on up to the house.

386
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:59,404
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

387
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:01,950
Here. Cover it up with that, huh?

388
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:05,918
I don't want you giving
the old lady a heart attack.

389
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:54,829
- You all right in there?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine!

390
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:57,905
Supper's on the table.

391
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:00,135
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

392
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:13,885
I swear, I'm gonna pay for it.

393
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:18,954
- Set it down over there.
- Right.

394
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:24,533
Come and sit down, son.

395
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:33,167
I can't thank you both enough
for everything.

396
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:36,405
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

397
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:38,379
- "Decent."
- What?

398
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:43,477
Nothing. I'm just not
really used to that word.

399
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:48,087
That's a nice chopper you've got out there.

400
00:48:48,157 --> 00:48:50,523
- You know motorcycles?
- Oh! Lord, here we go.

401
00:48:50,593 --> 00:48:54,256
My favorite's a '48 Panhead.
Bought one new off the line.

402
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,423
I think you're a little young for that, son.

403
00:48:56,499 --> 00:48:59,559
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

404
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,102
In the barn.

405
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:04,671
Nothing you can break out there.

406
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,424
<i>Why is the moon so lonely?</i>

407
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,925
<i>Why?</i>

408
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:26,861
<i>Because she used to have a lover.</i>

409
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:31,128
<i>He can never touch her again.</i>

410
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,213
You sleep okay?

411
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:56,720
Yeah.

412
00:49:58,194 --> 00:50:01,357
You look like a man
fixing to do a bad thing.

413
00:50:03,866 --> 00:50:07,324
You know what happens
to men who go looking for blood?

414
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:10,600
- What?
- They find it.

415
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,404
We all got a choice, son.

416
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:19,880
- Yeah, well, mine got taken.
- Bullshit.

417
00:50:23,886 --> 00:50:25,911
This was my son's jacket.

418
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:29,623
Try it on.

419
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:48,970
- Thank you.
- Yep.

420
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:54,415
You want to take my bike for a spin?
Test the suspension?

421
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:57,184
'64, huh?

422
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:01,649
Man, you're heavy.

423
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:03,988
Yeah, I put on a little weight recently.

424
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,221
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

425
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:11,265
Oh. It fits you beautifully.

426
00:51:13,502 --> 00:51:15,026
I brought you some...

427
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,481
Weapon X is in the barn.
He's just murdered two civilians.

428
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,951
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

429
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,043
Come get me.

430
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:10,258
Blow his brains all over the road!

431
00:52:10,326 --> 00:52:11,657
Damn it!

432
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:50,158
Alpha one, do not lose him!

433
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,542
Alpha two! Target coming to you!

434
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,759
Pull up!

435
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:25,886
Pull back! Pull back!

436
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,980
<i>Zero?</i>

437
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,445
<i>Zero, come in.</i>

438
00:54:53,689 --> 00:54:55,122
<i>Zero?</i>

439
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,622
<i>- Zero, is Logan dead?</i>
- I don't know.

440
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,466
I'm down.

441
00:55:07,636 --> 00:55:09,968
<i>Zero, is he dead? Is Logan dead?</i>

442
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,071
<i>Zero, come in.</i>

443
00:55:20,516 --> 00:55:22,484
<i>You tried to kill me.</i>

444
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:24,852
- Logan?
- Where's Victor?

445
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,649
Come back to base.

446
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:28,987
I'll explain everything.
We'll take Victor down together.

447
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:32,824
Wrong answer.
After I kill Victor, I'm coming for you.

448
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:37,692
<i>Logan, listen to me.</i>

449
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:41,668
If you go down this road,
you're not gonna like what you find.

450
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:45,764
You wanted the animal, Colonel.
You got it.

451
00:55:50,813 --> 00:55:54,772
Those were good people back there.
Innocent people.

452
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:08,828
It's funny how good, innocent people tend
to die around you.

453
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:31,744
Zero never stood a chance.

454
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:35,955
The only thing that'll take him down
is an Adamantium bullet.

455
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:46,401
This facility's compromised.
Prep transport.

456
00:56:55,344 --> 00:56:57,471
Colonel, this is turning into a disaster.

457
00:56:57,546 --> 00:57:00,140
- Don't worry. We'll stop him.
- Really?

458
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:04,209
You just spent half a billion dollars
making him indestructible.

459
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,548
- Sir?
- Yes?

460
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:11,423
The young mutant you've been looking for.
We've found him.

461
00:57:11,493 --> 00:57:13,893
General, Logan isn't
the only piece of this puzzle.

462
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,158
I need to evacuate this facility.

463
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:19,724
Please go back to Washington.
We've got work to do.

464
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:25,469
<i>Yo hablo,</i> I talk.
<i>Tú hablas,</i> you talk.

465
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:27,975
<i>Él habla...</i> Somebody translate.

466
00:57:29,178 --> 00:57:30,406
Summers!

467
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,313
Sit up and take off those glasses.

468
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,378
I have a headache.

469
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,451
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

470
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:42,615
while you write out this conjugation
100 times.

471
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:44,625
- Somebody else?
- He talks.

472
00:57:44,693 --> 00:57:46,718
Thank you. He talks. <i>ÉI habla.</i>

473
00:57:58,307 --> 00:58:00,571
- You sure it was Victor?
- Yeah.

474
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:04,645
Damn. I'm sorry, man.

475
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,543
What the hell happened to him after I left?

476
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:13,884
He got worse.
He felt like you abandoned him.

477
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:15,651
Hell, we all did.

478
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:19,561
But Victor, he had to prove
he was better than you.

479
00:58:19,628 --> 00:58:22,791
Hunting and killing
everything he was pointed at.

480
00:58:22,865 --> 00:58:25,129
Quit a few months later myself.

481
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,532
Couldn't take rounding them up.

482
00:58:27,903 --> 00:58:30,337
- Rounding who up?
- Leave it alone.

483
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:32,773
Rounding who up, John?

484
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:35,206
Hey! Damn it, John!

485
00:58:35,277 --> 00:58:37,541
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

486
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,581
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

487
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:43,641
Mutants? Why?

488
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,453
Stryker said we'd be making a difference,

489
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:50,117
protecting people from the bad ones.

490
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:01,034
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

491
00:59:01,103 --> 00:59:05,563
- Remember that stuff in Africa?
- Yeah, I remember Africa. What about it?

492
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:10,171
Damn.

493
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,807
What'd they do to you, man?

494
00:59:14,116 --> 00:59:15,549
Don't ask.

495
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:19,481
Listen, Zero said something
about an island.

496
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:21,113
Does that mean anything to you?

497
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,454
Nope. But maybe Dukes knows.

498
00:59:23,926 --> 00:59:26,520
- Him and Zero were real tight.
- Fred Dukes? Where is he?

499
00:59:26,595 --> 00:59:28,062
- He's here.
- Well, let's go talk to him.

500
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,190
Hold on. He don't get in till around 4:00.

501
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:34,599
But I got to warn you, he developed
a bit of an eating disorder.

502
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:38,970
We all got our coping mechanisms.
I'm trying to whup him back into shape.

503
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:41,441
Whatever you do,
don't mention his weight.

504
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,242
Come on, Fred, if you wanna get
in shape, you got to move, man.

505
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:48,283
I told him he got to move.
He's got to move! What?

506
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,048
Fred Dukes? That looks like
the creature that ate Fred Dukes.

507
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,988
Hey, be nice, man.

508
00:59:57,726 --> 00:59:59,694
Hey, fat... Fred.

509
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:04,398
I seem to remember that girl
when she was about 85 pounds, huh?

510
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:08,365
Oh, that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

511
01:00:08,437 --> 01:00:10,530
You know where Victor is?

512
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,932
- No idea.
- What's the island, slim?

513
01:00:16,578 --> 01:00:18,478
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

514
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:20,879
Listen, I ain't leaving here
till you tell me where Victor is.

515
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:23,850
So come on, bub, for old times' sake, huh?

516
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:28,781
Did you just call me Blob?

517
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:32,059
No, but...

518
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:40,694
I told you not to mention his weight.
Why'd you call him Blob?

519
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:43,203
I didn't call him Blob. I said "bub".

520
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:45,502
- God damn it.
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Logan.

521
01:00:45,574 --> 01:00:46,836
I got an idea.

522
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,935
- This is your idea of an idea?
- I'm trying to help you out, Logan.

523
01:00:51,013 --> 01:00:52,605
Dukes don't like you that much
and you know it.

524
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:54,945
- Yeah, the feeling's mutual.
- Well, use them gloves, man.

525
01:00:55,017 --> 01:00:59,283
Dance with him a little bit.
Allow him to let his anger out on you.

526
01:00:59,354 --> 01:01:02,380
Figure if you do that, he'll probably
tell you everything you want to know.

527
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,255
Come on, man, look at him.

528
01:01:04,326 --> 01:01:07,056
Got a big old ass coming out
the front of his shirt.

529
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:09,529
Jesus. He's gonna have a coronary,
for Christ's sake.

530
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:12,465
Is there even a stretcher big enough
to take this guy out of here?

531
01:01:14,269 --> 01:01:16,567
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out of here on a stretcher.

532
01:01:16,638 --> 01:01:19,129
- You're an asshole.
- Come on, Logan.

533
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:23,334
- Whup his ass!
- You want it?

534
01:01:23,412 --> 01:01:25,346
Dance with him, Fred!
Just like I taught you.

535
01:01:26,014 --> 01:01:27,038
You want to dance with me?

536
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:29,913
- Come on, Fred!
- Oh! Oh, that feels good.

537
01:01:33,155 --> 01:01:34,816
Hey! Guess what?

538
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:37,622
See, he gonna talk now.

539
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:40,093
- You got him right where you want him.
- Whose side are you on, anyway?

540
01:01:40,162 --> 01:01:41,629
Come on!

541
01:01:42,264 --> 01:01:44,232
Come on, now, lamb chop!

542
01:01:59,815 --> 01:02:01,009
Damn!

543
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,155
Now, where's Victor?

544
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,622
Little dark for sunglasses, don't you think?

545
01:03:07,215 --> 01:03:11,549
- Please, don't! Please, don't!
- Victor!

546
01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:17,523
Hey, hey! Where's Victor?

547
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:24,431
Yeah. Victor's with Stryker on the island.

548
01:03:24,499 --> 01:03:26,967
They run it together.

549
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:31,139
What? They what?
Victor will be with Stryker?

550
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,200
Yeah.

551
01:03:33,942 --> 01:03:35,933
You didn't know that?

552
01:03:55,931 --> 01:04:00,368
All that's left now is Logan.
I trust you can handle that.

553
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:05,470
- I did before, didn't I?
- Oh, yes. You did that.

554
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:12,109
Our deal. It still applies, right?

555
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:17,577
Of course.
Now bag him and tag him, Captain.

556
01:04:26,561 --> 01:04:28,324
What's the island?

557
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:33,228
It's where Stryker takes
them after Victor's caught them.

558
01:04:34,269 --> 01:04:36,567
Wait, hang on a minute. Takes who?

559
01:04:38,273 --> 01:04:39,604
Mutants.

560
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:44,539
Rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

561
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,814
I mean, you never wondered
what happened to them?

562
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:51,648
I tried not to.

563
01:05:08,003 --> 01:05:11,439
They killed her so I'd let them
put Adamantium in me.

564
01:05:14,743 --> 01:05:17,576
They killed her for a goddamn experiment.

565
01:05:21,683 --> 01:05:25,949
- Where is it? Where is it?
- Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

566
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:34,519
But a prisoner escaped there once.

567
01:05:34,596 --> 01:05:37,064
- Who?
- His name was Remy LeBeau.

568
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:39,396
He was a street hustler from New Orleans.

569
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:42,335
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

570
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:43,769
because he kept taking
all their money at poker.

571
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,807
- That's all I know.
- What's Stryker up to, Fred?

572
01:05:45,874 --> 01:05:47,637
What's the endgame?

573
01:05:49,644 --> 01:05:54,138
He's taking their powers.
Trying to combine them somehow.

574
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:57,083
That's all I know, Logan. That's all I know.

575
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:01,382
If I have to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

576
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,321
I'm coming with you, Logan.

577
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:11,528
- There's no redemption where I'm going.
- I ain't asking.

578
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:50,966
There's our dude.

579
01:06:57,245 --> 01:06:58,974
That's cool.

580
01:06:59,047 --> 01:07:01,106
I'm gonna go cover the back
in case he rabbits.

581
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,310
- I'm not gonna fight with him.
- Yeah, right.

582
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:05,444
What? I get in fights with everybody?

583
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,647
Don't dogs kill cats?

584
01:07:07,722 --> 01:07:10,190
Just go cover the back, will you?

585
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,687
- Give me 500.
- I'm in.

586
01:07:22,604 --> 01:07:24,367
Are you Remy LeBeau?

587
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,771
- Do I owe you money?
- No.

588
01:07:30,412 --> 01:07:32,312
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

589
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:53,765
Large blind's 100. Small blind's 50.

590
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:58,730
- May I deal you in?
- What can I get for 17 bucks?

591
01:07:59,808 --> 01:08:01,105
$17?

592
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:04,736
A cab ride home, perhaps?

593
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:11,980
You my brother's new babysitter, John?

594
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:14,186
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

595
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,349
And your creepy black coat
don't scare me.

596
01:08:16,424 --> 01:08:17,652
Really?

597
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,360
Worked on Dukes.

598
01:08:20,428 --> 01:08:22,658
You shouldn't have done that,
'cause now I'm gonna kill you

599
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,858
before Logan even gets a chance.

600
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:27,726
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

601
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:29,360
Victor Creed.

602
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,535
And who's that?

603
01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:35,368
The man I'm gonna kill.

604
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:40,478
He works with a man named Stryker
on an island.

605
01:08:41,983 --> 01:08:45,475
- Just need to know where it is.
- And why would you think I know that?

606
01:08:45,553 --> 01:08:48,420
Well, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit.

607
01:08:49,524 --> 01:08:54,223
You're the guy who escaped and you're
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

608
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:58,960
You know, John, there's something
I always wanted to tell you.

609
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,066
You're predictable.

610
01:09:10,879 --> 01:09:13,370
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

611
01:09:14,349 --> 01:09:17,079
That's funny. Never knew you had one.

612
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:24,022
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

613
01:09:25,393 --> 01:09:28,487
The men who took me wore
tags just like them.

614
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:34,533
Hey, now, bub, you listen to me.

615
01:09:52,153 --> 01:09:54,053
Damn it. That little...

616
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:11,600
Two years I rotted in that hellhole
and I ain't never going back.

617
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:17,208
Shiny.

618
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:22,008
Tell me something, Jimmy.

619
01:10:22,684 --> 01:10:25,084
Do you even know how to kill me?

620
01:10:25,153 --> 01:10:27,883
I'm gonna cut your goddamned head off.

621
01:10:28,556 --> 01:10:30,421
See if that works.

622
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:42,367
You're getting slow, old man.

623
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:53,047
You son of a bitch.

624
01:10:56,684 --> 01:10:59,551
You're gonna die for what you did to her.

625
01:11:23,778 --> 01:11:25,040
Victor!

626
01:11:34,989 --> 01:11:37,082
Well, that's a nice stick.

627
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:38,075
Okay, shithead, here's the deal.

628
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:41,520
See, you're gonna take me to this island,
where I can kill Creed, Stryker

629
01:12:41,589 --> 01:12:45,787
and pretty much everyone you hate
in this world. Do you understand?

630
01:12:46,461 --> 01:12:48,122
You're really gonna kill them?

631
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:50,994
As long as you stay out of my way, yeah.

632
01:13:05,046 --> 01:13:06,513
Colonel?

633
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:09,311
- General?
- Is this Weapon XI?

634
01:13:11,886 --> 01:13:14,787
All their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

635
01:13:14,856 --> 01:13:16,790
You really hate them, don't you?

636
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:18,758
No, I don't hate them.

637
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:23,426
After 20 years of working with mutants,
I just know what they can do.

638
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:31,396
We can win this war before it starts
and save countless lives in the process.

639
01:13:31,472 --> 01:13:35,033
Pre- emptive action is
the only action here, General.

640
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:38,840
The days of our country
sitting on the sidelines are over.

641
01:13:39,814 --> 01:13:43,875
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

642
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,785
- I admire your passion, I do.
- Thank you.

643
01:13:47,555 --> 01:13:49,853
But this is as far as it goes.

644
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:54,419
- Weapon X was a hiccup.
- We know about your son, Bill.

645
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:58,624
We know he's a mutant,
and we know he killed your wife.

646
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,760
- You shouldn't have kept that from us.
- That...

647
01:14:03,304 --> 01:14:05,033
That has nothing
to do with my work, General.

648
01:14:05,106 --> 01:14:06,437
Bullshit.

649
01:14:06,741 --> 01:14:10,040
You're too close to this.
I'm shutting you down.

650
01:14:10,778 --> 01:14:15,215
Okay. You're right. I won't lie to you.

651
01:14:18,686 --> 01:14:22,349
My son did bring
the problem home for me,

652
01:14:23,858 --> 01:14:25,621
but I took an oath

653
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:29,392
to protect the American people

654
01:14:30,498 --> 01:14:33,467
from every threat, both foreign

655
01:14:41,576 --> 01:14:43,237
and domestic.

656
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:53,016
- You don't like flying, huh?
- I'm fine.

657
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,520
- Just concentrate on what you're doing.
- You sure?

658
01:14:54,589 --> 01:14:56,216
You got a bit of sweat
on your brow there.

659
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,952
Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...

660
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,789
On the what? The clouds?
Keep my eyes on the clouds?

661
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:01,453
You're up and down
like a freaking yo- yo here!

662
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:03,929
- Where'd you get this thing, anyway?
- Oh, this is my baby.

663
01:15:03,998 --> 01:15:06,728
I won her in a game. Jacks over fives.

664
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,298
Great.

665
01:15:09,871 --> 01:15:12,032
Relax. We're almost there.

666
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:18,846
There it is. The island. Three Mile Island.

667
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,348
Hiding in plain sight.

668
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:26,877
No one's gonna snoop
around a nuclear reactor.

669
01:15:26,954 --> 01:15:28,945
They think it's gonna turn them
into freaks.

670
01:15:29,023 --> 01:15:31,082
- Like you?
- Right.

671
01:15:33,828 --> 01:15:36,558
All right. You ready?
Because it's now or never. Let's go.

672
01:15:36,631 --> 01:15:38,064
About time.

673
01:15:47,275 --> 01:15:50,836
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
this is really gonna hurt.

674
01:15:50,912 --> 01:15:53,710
Well, yeah, it kind of does, actually.

675
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:57,817
- Good luck.
- Likewise.

676
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,282
Oh, shit.

677
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,255
How you doing? Everything all right?

678
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,325
- Is he ready yet?
- A few more hours.

679
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:18,634
- And he will respond to my commands?
- Absolutely.

680
01:17:22,336 --> 01:17:23,564
Logan.

681
01:17:24,839 --> 01:17:26,932
Welcome back to the war.

682
01:17:27,942 --> 01:17:30,809
Before I gut you, I want to know why.

683
01:17:32,513 --> 01:17:34,845
I needed your powers for the Pool.

684
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,384
- For the what?
- The mutant killer.

685
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:39,911
Dead pool.

686
01:17:41,155 --> 01:17:43,123
Years of searching and refining,

687
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:47,150
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body

688
01:17:47,228 --> 01:17:49,389
without ripping it apart.

689
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:53,329
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

690
01:17:55,169 --> 01:17:57,330
Logan, you were the last.

691
01:17:57,405 --> 01:17:59,635
You made Weapon XI possible.

692
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:05,908
I asked you to help,
but you said you wanted the quiet life.

693
01:18:08,015 --> 01:18:09,209
Well,

694
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:14,786
I've learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge.

695
01:18:32,373 --> 01:18:33,806
Who are you?

696
01:18:34,675 --> 01:18:36,836
Oh, she's real, old friend.

697
01:18:48,756 --> 01:18:51,987
Did you really think
we'd just let you walk away?

698
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,353
You're a dangerous man.

699
01:18:54,428 --> 01:18:57,192
We like to keep an eye on dangerous men.

700
01:18:57,932 --> 01:19:00,332
Tell him about the day you died.

701
01:19:06,207 --> 01:19:09,301
They gave me a shot
of hydrochlorothiazide.

702
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:15,042
It reduces the heart rate so low
it appears you flatlined.

703
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:28,986
Don't be angry with her.

704
01:19:29,997 --> 01:19:32,727
She's a real credit to your species.

705
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:39,495
Did you know that her sister has
diamond- hard skin?

706
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:43,003
Kayla's mutation is tactohypnosis.

707
01:19:43,644 --> 01:19:46,704
She can influence people
as long as she touches them.

708
01:19:46,781 --> 01:19:49,409
Quite a useful tool in a seduction.

709
01:19:49,483 --> 01:19:51,815
It was never real, my friend.

710
01:19:57,224 --> 01:19:59,124
It was real for me.

711
01:20:01,128 --> 01:20:05,588
I told you if you came down this road,
you wouldn't like what you found.

712
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:16,640
That story you told me about a man
who gets flowers for the moon,

713
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,544
I had it backwards.

714
01:20:23,751 --> 01:20:27,209
I thought you were the moon
and I was your wolverine.

715
01:20:29,523 --> 01:20:32,219
But you're the trickster, aren't you?

716
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:35,294
I'm just the fool who got played.

717
01:20:37,331 --> 01:20:40,323
The worst part of it is,
I should have known.

718
01:20:43,437 --> 01:20:45,667
But I ignored my instincts.

719
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:51,540
I ignored what I really am.

720
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:58,641
But that won't ever happen again.

721
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:32,285
- Colonel?
- Not now, Kayla.

722
01:21:32,353 --> 01:21:34,878
I've done everything you've asked.

723
01:21:36,357 --> 01:21:37,790
My sister.

724
01:21:38,759 --> 01:21:41,785
You said if I helped you, you'd let her go.

725
01:21:41,862 --> 01:21:46,492
Kayla, it's not as simple as that.
Her mutation is unique. Quite beautiful.

726
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:48,797
We just need a little more time
to analyze it, that's all.

727
01:21:48,869 --> 01:21:50,496
You let him go?

728
01:21:53,974 --> 01:21:56,340
- Victor, please.
- You can't let him go.

729
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,401
- You can't beat him, Victor.
- Then give me the Adamantium!

730
01:21:58,479 --> 01:21:59,878
- Your tests came back.
- We had a deal!

731
01:21:59,947 --> 01:22:02,609
You would never survive the operation.

732
01:22:04,785 --> 01:22:07,948
- I can take anything he can.
- No, you can't.

733
01:22:08,756 --> 01:22:12,715
You're my favorite soldier, Victor.
Be patient. Your time will come.

734
01:22:12,793 --> 01:22:14,420
He's using us.

735
01:22:23,003 --> 01:22:26,461
How about this time you die for real?

736
01:22:28,075 --> 01:22:29,508
Let me go.

737
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,673
Your little mind games don't work on me.

738
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:36,080
Victor!

739
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:12,510
Feels good, doesn't it?

740
01:23:13,754 --> 01:23:15,449
All that rage.

741
01:23:17,191 --> 01:23:19,989
- Do it.
- Logan!

742
01:23:21,328 --> 01:23:24,991
- You're not an animal.
- Oh, yes, you are.

743
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:30,502
Do it.

744
01:23:34,341 --> 01:23:35,808
Finish it.

745
01:24:00,334 --> 01:24:01,665
Logan?

746
01:24:05,005 --> 01:24:08,839
My sister. They have my sister.

747
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:12,278
Please. I didn't trick you into loving me.

748
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,207
It was real for me, too.

749
01:24:17,785 --> 01:24:21,243
Please, I'm so sorry. They have my sister.

750
01:24:22,823 --> 01:24:24,290
Where is she?

751
01:24:29,763 --> 01:24:32,288
- Activate Weapon XI!
- The bonding process isn't complete.

752
01:24:32,366 --> 01:24:33,993
Just do it! Now!

753
01:25:37,231 --> 01:25:38,960
Come on. Come on!

754
01:26:30,317 --> 01:26:31,443
Okay.

755
01:26:32,486 --> 01:26:33,783
Perfect.

756
01:26:33,854 --> 01:26:35,651
- Kayla, get these kids out of here.
- Logan...

757
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:37,588
Find another way out.

758
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:40,219
Okay. Let's go.

759
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:42,659
Wade, is that you?

760
01:26:46,433 --> 01:26:49,834
Guess Stryker finally figured out
how to shut you up.

761
01:26:51,939 --> 01:26:53,201
Now...

762
01:27:00,447 --> 01:27:01,675
Wade?

763
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,809
You don't have to do this.

764
01:27:05,686 --> 01:27:07,677
All right, maybe you do.

765
01:27:14,628 --> 01:27:16,562
You're shitting me.

766
01:27:21,802 --> 01:27:23,599
Shoot on sight!

767
01:27:31,478 --> 01:27:34,641
- I can help! Point me at them!
- Go.

768
01:27:42,589 --> 01:27:44,147
Go! Now!

769
01:27:50,464 --> 01:27:52,955
- Did I get them?
- Yeah.

770
01:28:03,143 --> 01:28:04,667
- Let's go.
- I can't go.

771
01:28:04,745 --> 01:28:07,373
- Kayla, come on!
- I have to stay here.

772
01:28:07,881 --> 01:28:09,508
You take them.

773
01:28:10,484 --> 01:28:12,679
Go! Go!

774
01:28:40,547 --> 01:28:41,980
<i>Go left.</i>

775
01:28:42,049 --> 01:28:43,243
Left.

776
01:28:44,084 --> 01:28:45,813
- What?
- We go left.

777
01:28:45,886 --> 01:28:47,979
- You can't see.
- Trust me.

778
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:05,003
Let's see you dance up here.

779
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,567
Nobody kills you but me.

780
01:29:52,352 --> 01:29:53,944
Back to back!

781
01:29:55,689 --> 01:29:58,157
- I got him!
- Oh, no, you don't.

782
01:31:33,487 --> 01:31:35,751
Stop! This can't be the way.

783
01:31:35,822 --> 01:31:37,312
- This is the way.
- How do you know?

784
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:39,222
I just know. Come on.

785
01:31:50,637 --> 01:31:52,434
Adamantium bullets.

786
01:31:53,073 --> 01:31:56,236
Let's see him heal with
a few of these through his thick skull.

787
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,870
You can't stop him, even with that.

788
01:31:59,246 --> 01:32:01,680
- He'll heal.
- His brain may heal,

789
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:06,184
but his memories won't grow back.

790
01:32:22,769 --> 01:32:26,034
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

791
01:32:27,307 --> 01:32:30,401
- We're done.
- We can never be done, Jimmy.

792
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:35,341
We're brothers,
and brothers look out for each other.

793
01:33:09,349 --> 01:33:11,374
- You miss me?
- Ah, Jesus.

794
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:15,253
You know, when you said
you were gonna kill everyone,

795
01:33:15,322 --> 01:33:17,813
I thought you may
just have been exaggerating.

796
01:33:17,891 --> 01:33:19,324
Yeah.

797
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:22,521
Do I look like a man who exaggerates?

798
01:33:22,596 --> 01:33:24,587
- You're welcome.
- Logan?

799
01:33:27,067 --> 01:33:28,364
Logan.

800
01:33:32,305 --> 01:33:34,773
There's kids trying to get off the island.
Split up. Go!

801
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:36,274
I'm on it.

802
01:33:44,217 --> 01:33:46,310
Kayla! Kayla!

803
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:51,550
Hey.

804
01:33:56,563 --> 01:33:58,030
I love you.

805
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:12,105
- Hey...
- I'm so cold.

806
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:15,205
Listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

807
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:16,772
Understand?

808
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:20,115
Just go easy. Nice and easy. That's it.
That's it.

809
01:34:22,522 --> 01:34:25,047
Okay. I'm gonna get you help.

810
01:34:48,448 --> 01:34:49,881
Logan!

811
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:48,799
I should make you pull the trigger.

812
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:52,512
But that would make us
no better than you.

813
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:55,411
Throw the gun away.

814
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:00,085
Turn around.

815
01:36:00,687 --> 01:36:05,317
Walk until your feet bleed.
And then keep walking.

816
01:36:43,363 --> 01:36:45,194
<i>It will be all right, Scott.</i>

817
01:36:45,265 --> 01:36:48,029
<i>My name is Charles Xavier.</i>

818
01:36:48,101 --> 01:36:50,126
<i>I'm a mutant like you.</i>

819
01:36:50,203 --> 01:36:54,401
<i>- I can hear your thoughts.</i>
<i>- Yes, and I can hear yours.</i>

820
01:36:55,241 --> 01:36:59,143
You're safe now. Come. We have to go.

821
01:37:00,146 --> 01:37:02,046
Come on, let's go.

822
01:37:48,328 --> 01:37:50,023
The kids are safe.

823
01:37:55,368 --> 01:37:56,630
Damn.

824
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:03,066
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

825
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:06,476
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now, we got to go.

826
01:38:07,213 --> 01:38:09,044
Where the hell am I?

827
01:38:09,115 --> 01:38:11,310
Listen to me. I'm a friend.

828
01:38:11,751 --> 01:38:14,447
- I'm a friend.
- Yeah? What's my name?

829
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:17,547
- What's my name?
- Your name is Logan.

830
01:38:21,895 --> 01:38:24,523
You need to trust me. We have to go.

831
01:38:29,969 --> 01:38:31,402
Follow me.

832
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:38,138
Now!

833
01:39:11,845 --> 01:39:13,472
Do you know her?

834
01:39:17,383 --> 01:39:18,714
No.

835
01:39:23,389 --> 01:39:25,516
Hey, these boys aren't gonna like
what you've done to this place.

836
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:27,526
We really need to go.

837
01:39:28,194 --> 01:39:30,059
I'll find my own way.

838
01:39:35,001 --> 01:39:36,434
Good luck.

839
01:41:07,627 --> 01:41:09,254
Colonel Stryker?

840
01:41:13,566 --> 01:41:17,195
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

841
01:41:18,404 --> 01:41:20,372
You're wanted for questioning
in connection with the death

842
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,931
of General Munson, sir.
