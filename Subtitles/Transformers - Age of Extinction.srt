There is one way you survive.

316
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,245
Tell me where he's hiding.

317
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,570
Where is Optimus Prime?

318
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,368
Never.

(LOCKDOWN TRANSFORMS)

322
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,731
I must say, it is remarkable,

323
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,317
really astounding,
the success that the CIA has had

324
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,235
since you have taken
operational control,

325
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,264
and so the President
has asked me to ask you

326
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,190
to ask him,

327
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,143
to invite you both

328
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,402
over to the White House
just to powwow,

329
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,500
where we get maybe
some more specifics about how

330
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,995
exactly you're hunting
the enemy Decepticons left.

331
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,422
I've had my desk for two years.

332
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,841
Mr. Attinger has been here for 25.

333
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,470
He runs the projects
where I don't ask for specifics.

334
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,213
That's why they're called Black Ops.

335
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,795
And why we all sleep better at night.

336
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,135
Check. That is great. So, um...

337
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,262
Any dirt on that?
Uh, how, uh, that's going?

338
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,594
Outstanding.

339
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,071
Great. Oh, great.

340
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,948
I was hoping to hear that.
The President will be pleased.

341
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:28,452
'Cause, I'll tell you right now, I've only
been Chief of Staff since Monday, um,

342
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,914
but I do know that
the alien war stuff, these are...

343
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,691
These are the only fun meetings.

344
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,502
ATTINGER: Look, I'm not here
to entertain the President,

345
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:40,031
but you may tell him
that the war will be over.

346
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,782
Soon.

347
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,886
"...be over..." In case he asks,
I just like to have an exact quote.

348
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,639
"War will be over soon."
That is great. Such good news.

349
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:53,018
And, um, the President would,
I know, just love...

350
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,312
Really, really love to press the flesh...

351
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,024
Not flesh, obviously,
but just maybe get a shot with, um...

352
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,346
Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime?

353
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,403
We could bop on Air Force One.

354
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,155
It'd be just a quick bop,
then we just bop in and bop back.

355
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,364
ATTINGER: I wouldn't get his hopes up
on that one.

356
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,390
Okay.

357

But aren't they our friends? Why?

360
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,462
Because our world
will never truly be safe

Oh. Well, I would hope we could do
a much more ceremonial farewell.

has worked so closely with them.

and set with finals,

Yes. With me, the mistake.

And the best thing that ever happened.

Do we look unhappy? Huh?
No. It's the greatest day of my life.

That's it.

It's only later they turn into men.

I wouldn't exist.

Within that manmade prototype I fought,

1776
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:07,028
I sensed the presence

built those bots in the first place, hmm?

<i>and that mind
wasn't as dead as they thought.</i>

a brand-new body.</i>

with his evil, nasty chromosomes.</i>
