1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,784
<i>Sayonara,</i> motherfucker!

3
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,389
<i>We're going live. Can you check on it?</i>

4
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,349
Ten cars down, two to go.

5
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:02,975
These drivers are crazy.

6
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,019
I still don't understand
why they're so willing to die.

7
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,563
Because everyone wants
to be king of the hill.

8
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:08,898
Is the race streaming on the Dark Web?

9
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,149
Yes, Warden.

10
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:14,987
It's online in real time
on Freenet, I2P, and Tor.

11
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,698
And there's no way to trace the ISP,

12
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,366
and shut 'em down with a web-based attack?

13
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,452
If I was the NSA,
and had a couple of months, maybe.

14
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,747
These guys are a legitimate cyber militia.

15
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:28,751
The encryption is first-rate,
it's bouncing every 10 seconds.

16
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,336
Then kill their power.

17
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,631
We don't supply their power,
they're on their own jerry-rigged grid.

18
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,639
Bitch up and take out this motherfucker!

19
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,398
Yeah, baby!

20
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,822
Fuck you, Frank!

21
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,702
Right now, get us another 22.

22
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,707
Any word from the OTB site?

23
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,792
Onsite and online wagering are up.

24
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,836
They're writing a lot of betting slips.

25
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,088
The house is banking cash
on the secondary racers

26
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,382
and the parlays,
and we're raking in some vig.

27
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,509
If Frankenstein wins, there's a payout.

28
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:22,138
Death Race is illegal, and bigger than ever.

29
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,265
Thanks to our resident crazy-man Frank.

30
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:25,808
Aw, fuck Frankenstein,

31
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,603
you're the one who resurrected
Death Race from the dead.

32
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,938
I just figured out how to
decode the satellite signals

33
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,273
and stream it on the Dark Web.

34
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,942
Frankenstein's been born again, thanks to us.

35
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:37,612
Well, if he wins tonight,
it'll be his seventh straight.

36
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,448
Our contact on the outside
says our margins are dropping

37
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,283
'cause nobody's taking
the other side of the bet.

38
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,368
We're losing a lot of money on Frankenstein.

39
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:47,955
We need to spice things up.
The parlays are paying off, but...

40
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,209
We need a challenger.

41
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,301
SWAT is en route, T-minus five minutes.

42
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:04,555
Let's shut Frankenstein
and Death Race down once and for all.

43
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,441
We've got some action from the outside.

44
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,569
You wanted spice. Say hello to SWAT.

45
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,120
Let's trade some paint.

46
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,290
Suck my dick, Frankie!

47
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,377
Suck my dick, too, Frankie!

48
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,170
Push them into the fucking wall!

49
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:41,801
Do it, baby!

50
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:47,765
Motherfucker!

51
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,602
Woo!

52
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,148
- Get off the wall!
- Got it!

53
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:00,194
Take this motherfucker out!

54
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,490
I picked the wrong driver!

55
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,458
Full house. Eights over aces.

56
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,512
Oh, nice. Nines over Jacks.

57
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:18,022
I'd like a shot at getting my money back.

58
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,613
Why don't I come to your place later tonight?

59
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:33,663
Maybe we can shuffle another deck of cards.

60
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,297
Hey, <i>jefe,</i> I've got a player,
wants to play some heavy action.

61
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,841
On SWAT versus Frankenstein.

62
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,593
- SWAT?
- SWAT.

63
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:52,515
Where does he want to play his money?

64
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,643
SWAT for 100,000. Even odds.

65
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,981
It's my book, I'll set the odds.

66
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,148
Three-to-one,

67
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,651
and if he gives you any push-back,

68
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,238
tell him the Mexican Jew said,
go to hell and take his mom.

69
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,199
I hope they got that last shipment of guns.

70
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,118
Now, make me some money, Frank.

71
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,147
Carley!

72
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,614
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

73
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:54,243
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

74
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,138
Move.

75
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,185
On the left. All clear!

76
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,270
Clear, sector one.

77
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,396
Bridge team, move out.

78
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,242
Go, go, go!

79
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,875
Hold up!

80
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,547
Move, move, move, back it up.
Go, go! All clear.

81
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,923
Tell me we got cameras in there.

82
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,843
Yeah, we've got cameras everywhere.

83
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:37,555
Go left.

84
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,225
Go left, clear.

85
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,231
Go right.

86
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,276
Go right, clear.

87
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,411
Two Tango down!

88
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,712
<i>Sector two, report.</i>

89
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,256
Copy that, one minute.

90
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,302
Spec Ops. Move.

91
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,429
- Got eyes on nothing?
- I got eyes.

92
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,436
Yeah, motherfuckers, let's go!

93
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:33,856
Go get some!

94
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,252
Send me the best you've got, Warden,

95
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,588
I'll send them back to you skinned,

96
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,340
<i>gutted and quartered.</i>

97
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:02,760
<i>You may be in charge out there,
but this is my city.</i>

98
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,470
<i>This is The Sprawl!</i>

99
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,150
Come around that first corner.

100
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:21,779
Hello?

101
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,031
This isn't going to play well
in the <i>Washington Post</i> tomorrow.

102
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,699
I know, Mr. Valentine.

103
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,659
Well, then you know
I've got Congress up my ass

104
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,536
about The Sprawl and its morality.

105
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,538
<i>Frankenstein is out of control,</i>

106
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,248
his legion is growing.

107
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,542
The government is going
to take back my prison,

108
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:38,921
<i>unless we shut down Frankenstein,
and shut him down, now.</i>

109
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,923
When I took over Weyland International,

110
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,051
I was tasked with a very specific directive.

111
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,970
Clean up The Sprawl,
and put an end to Frankenstein.

112
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,431
More importantly, Death Race.

113
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,350
<i>Our contract's up in five years</i>

114
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,477
<i>and we've got a lot invested
in that human garbage dump.</i>

115
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,563
So, when I get pulled into
a congressional oversight committee,

116
00:14:56,647 --> 00:15:00,109
what should I say to the 435
members of the House, huh?

117
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,027
Well, tell them that we're
doing our best, but...

118
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,905
But what? We can't control a bunch
of sociopathic gearheads,

119
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,615
and Frankenstein's even more legendary,

120
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,242
now that Death Race is illegal?

121
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,827
I can handle Frankenstein, sir.

122
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,911
<i>Really?</i>

123
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,123
'Cause from where I sit, Frankenstein's
making you look like a chump.

124
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,126
He's gathering steam and mounting
what adds up to a small army.

125
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,129
You can't shut him down from the outside.

126
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:24,383
He's just a mask. Anybody can wear the mask.

127
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:29,430
His disciples, inside and out, need to
see him suffer a humiliating defeat.

128
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,266
He needs to die during
Death Race, and die bloody.

129
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,184
He loses Death Race, he loses his power.

130
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,145
That's how you take back our prison.

131
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,230
Make it happen, or I will.

132
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,657
What I'm about to feed you
is going to taste bitter!

133
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,203
You have found yourselves
in a no-win situation!

134
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:57,499
There are two options! Die, or survive!

135
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:02,004
You will not be given clothes,
what you're wearing is what you'll wear!

136
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,090
You will not be given a place to sleep,

137
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,051
you will not be given jack shit,

138
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,263
except maybe a bullet in the brain!

139
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,641
If you are lucky. Rest assured,

140
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,686
there are no virgins within these walls,

141
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,941
because life has fucked you all!

142
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:26,820
The Sprawl is 88,000 acres

143
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:30,365
of bad shit about to happen.

144
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:36,330
The Containment Zone warehouses
420,000 of the worst...

145
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,915
Of the worst offenders.

146
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:43,795
Best advice, learn how to run.
Learn how to fight!

147
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,298
Stop eye-fucking me, asshole.

148
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:52,971
Uncle Sam has decided to provide you
with one roll of silver coins.

149
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:57,518
This will be your currency inside the walls!

150
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,019
That's the hot wash!

151
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:04,316
Now, get yourselves ready,
we're approaching DZ Alpha Bravo!

152
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,539
Convicts, go, go!

153
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,917
Make the world a better place!
Get the fuck out of here!

154
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,088
How do I get in Death Race?

155
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,383
Find Baltimore Bob. If you got
what it takes, he'll get you in.

156
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,969
Move! Get off my bird, now!

157
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,263
Let's go!

158
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,890
Come on, what are you staring at? Come on!

159
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,847
Who wants to play?

160
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,142
Come here, motherfucker!

161
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:21,852
On your knees!

162
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,439
Get the fuck on the ground.

163
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,774
What is this shit?

164
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,403
Shut your fucking mouth!

165
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,197
Quit eyeballing me!

166
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,617
Well, ain't this a rainbow of fucking ugly?

167
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,204
- You folks lost?
- We're good.

168
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,041
You look lost.

169
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,168
Nah, we're good, thanks.

170
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,420
You're good?

171
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,009
That's good.

172
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,011
Now, give me your fucking silver.

173
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,429
Why would we do that?

174
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,682
It's a landing tax.

175
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,060
Why don't you just shoot us and take it?

176
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:13,904
Maybe I don't want to waste
my bullets on a gutter bitch like you.

177
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,865
Huh? Mmm.

178
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,309
Mmm.

179
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,120
You're a real sweet talker, ain't you?

180
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,581
Thanks, I try.

181
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,626
I don't think you have any bullets.

182
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,922
In fact, I think you're shooting blanks.

183
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,679
Okay?

184
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:42,641
You folks want to play the hard way?
Up against the fucking truck!

185
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,391
Is this what you wanted?

186
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,114
I got this bad feeling I owe you, pretty boy.

187
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:40,991
We're square.

188
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,749
You're the one that gave the cops a beating?

189
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,794
I don't want any trouble.

190
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,337
Oh, you don't?

191
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,881
'Cause if you tuned up the cops,
you're gonna have some.

192
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,050
I'm just looking for Baltimore Bob.

193
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,347
Then jump in, cowboy.

194
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,808
I'll give you a ride.

195
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,451
Yeah, bitch.

196
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,152
Fuck you, asshole!

197
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,238
Fuck off, 'Tilly.

198
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:30,243
If I had a dick, here's where
I'd tell your ass to suck it.

199
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,664
So, your story is that one unarmed man

200
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:38,752
took out you and your gang,
and boosted my landing tax?

201
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,879
I'm sorry, Frank, I'll do better next time.

202
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:44,049
There's no next times in The Sprawl,
you know this.

203
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:47,677
You got sent here for killing cops,
and you can't handle one con?

204
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,680
Like I said, I'm sorry, Frank,
I'll do better next time.

205
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,933
He just got lucky.

206
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,437
Every piece of silver you collect
goes right back to The Sprawl.

207
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,232
When my landing tax goes
uncollected, the city suffers.

208
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,073
Do you like to suffer?

209
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,952
I don't like to suffer, Frank.

210
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,549
That's him. That's the motherfucker!

211
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,180
Hey, Bex.

212
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,556
This guy's looking for Baltimore Bob.

213
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,185
Of course, he is.

214
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:40,814
Connor Gibson, meet Jane.

215
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,399
It's good to meet you, Jane.

216
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,359
He's all yours, <i>chica.</i>

217
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,736
I'ma go dance on the pole.

218
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,113
Do it over, girl!

219
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,868
So, where'd you come in from?

220
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,495
Long Beach.

221
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,913
What are you in for?

222
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,082
Does it matter?

223
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,001
It does to me.

224
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,503
I'm here 'cause I'm here,
just like everyone else.

225
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,027
One of my tax collectors told me

226
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,820
you attacked him, then robbed him.

227
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,490
That's not exactly how it went down.

228
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,241
Enlighten me, convict.

229
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,785
Kill him, Frank!

230
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,787
Your boy and his pals tried to jump me.

231
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,497
Yet, you're the one who walked away.

232
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,373
I didn't say they were any good at it.

233
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:23,541
Let me whack him, Frank.

234
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,627
Ain't nothing but a couple drops of jizz

235
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,837
sprouted from a shit-filled
crack in the sidewalk.

236
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,508
Have we met before?

237
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:36,304
I don't think so. I just got here.

238
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,765
And if we had, I wouldn't know.

239
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,100
You're hiding behind a mask.

240
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:44,854
This is my city.
No one speaks to me like that.

241
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,439
Kill that motherfucker!

242
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:49,442
Listen, you accused me of stealing,
and I didn't steal anything.

243
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:52,195
I defended myself. It's not my fault

244
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,031
your boys weren't up to
the fight they picked.

245
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,661
Watch your back, convict.

246
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,932
You're definitely not from Long Beach.

247
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,731
You make it a habit to punch
above your weight, convict?

248
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,236
Word is you're looking for me.

249
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:35,405
Baltimore Bob?

250
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:43,288
Your balls must be made out of titanium.

251
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,251
I've never seen anyone
talk to Frank like that.

252
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:53,882
You drive?

253
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,511
Yeah, I drive.

254
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:01,014
So, what are you in here for, Bob?

255
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:04,184
Let's just say, I help people transition.

256
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,937
The press called me Dr. Kill.
I was an oncologist.

257
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:11,524
Yeah, I read about you.
You euthanized over 400 dying people.

258
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,569
I had 432, and not all of them were dying.

259
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,613
Some were living inconsequential lives,

260
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,656
and as such, they were already dead.

261
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,660
Come on, come on!

262
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,288
Get the truck!

263
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,590
This food is property of Frankenstein!

264
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,384
- What the hell are they doing?
- Feeding time.

265
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:39,594
Disciples of Frank.

266
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,472
They hijack the food shipment
and control the supply.

267
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,350
If you keep the populace hungry,
they're easier to control.

268
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,310
Where do all the weapons and cars come from?

269
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,063
Handmade, homemade,
we lick the bottom of the pot,

270
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,981
and refurbish whatever sticks to our tongues.

271
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,442
And we got a benefactor on the outside.

272
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:08,164
Step away from the vehicle, you motherfucker!

273
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,502
Die, motherfucker!

274
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,589
Fuck you! Nazi fuck!

275
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,588
You're the one everybody's talking about?

276
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,216
News travels fast, huh?

277
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,221
Small town, really, 226,000 to be exact.

278
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:09,517
We have about 19,000 deaths a year
and 22,000 come over the wall.

279
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,229
Sorry, I'm doing it again.

280
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,816
Connor Gibson, meet Lists.

281
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,238
So, what am I watching here?

282
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:25,575
It's where non-racers compete
for a spot in Death Race.

283
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,868
And how do you get a spot?

284
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,578
You have to win the Death Match.

285
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,499
<i>Let this Death Match begin!</i>

286
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:41,090
<i>Our first contestant is all the way
from New York City, New York.</i>

287
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:46,012
<i>She's a killer and a thief,
and one sexy little piece of ass.</i>

288
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:50,641
<i>Give it up for Gipsy Rose!</i>

289
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,193
<i>Next up, born in the tall cotton</i>

290
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,820
<i>and chicken-droppings of Oxford, Mississippi,</i>

291
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,781
- <i>we have a psychotic...</i>
- Who's the girl?

292
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:05,948
Frank's main squeeze.

293
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,409
Your standard, garden-variety pleasure model.

294
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,746
Carley J'adore, it's her stage name.

295
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,624
She was charged with 17 counts
of human trafficking,

296
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:19,170
eight counts prostitution, and another
five counts of false imprisonment.

297
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,630
She's an ex-cheerleader.

298
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:21,881
Ex-porn star.

299
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,466
Exactly.

300
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,593
Hmm. Never did a day's work vertical.

301
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,483
<i>On your marks, get set, and die!</i>

302
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,949
Kill, kill, kill!

303
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,869
Kill, kill, kill!

304
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,587
I can't hear you! Yeah!

305
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,391
Shut your fucking mouth!

306
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:39,930
Yeah! Yeah!

307
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:19,720
Don't pick a fight with Godzilla

308
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,555
'cause you think you know
how to throw a punch.

309
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,517
Sleep on it.

310
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,478
You still want Death Race tomorrow,

311
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,023
we'll talk.

312
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,955
Hey, Long Beach.

313
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:50,668
Got a bottle. Could use some company.

314
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:55,464
- It's nice in here.
- Thanks.

315
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:02,054
Go ahead and ask. Everybody always asks.

316
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:05,474
It's kind of like the,
"What's your star sign?" line in here.

317
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:11,439
I'm guilty.

318
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,566
I wasn't gonna ask.

319
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,152
Yeah, but you would have found out, anyway.

320
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,112
There's no secrets here in The Sprawl.

321
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:25,911
I married a really great guy,

322
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:29,248
who turned out to be not such a great guy.

323
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:36,046
He beat me up a couple of times,

324
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,466
I forgave him.

325
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:42,219
The market crashed, he lost his job,

326
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,180
smacked me around a bit more.

327
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:49,185
I forgave him again.

328
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:54,565
And then one day,

329
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,818
I didn't forgive him.

330
00:37:57,902 --> 00:37:59,820
And I shot him nine times.

331
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:05,409
You know my one regret, though?

332
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,999
Is that I didn't shoot the bastard 10.

333
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,840
So, you still wanna knock boots with me?

334
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:23,385
Never said I did.

335
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,810
Okay, well,

336
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:33,062
wasn't really up for the taking, anyway.

337
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,565
I just needed somebody
to finish this bottle with,

338
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:46,534
and you're some mysterious guy
from Long Beach, right?

339
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,328
Get some sleep.

340
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,250
Couch is yours if you want it.

341
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,641
Welcome to the Greenhouse.

342
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,561
This is Baltimore Bob's
one-of-a-kind creation.

343
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:17,523
Inspired by the Chinese solar
greenhouse designs with CO2 enrichment.

344
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:21,944
Pesticide free, and totally 100% organic.

345
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:25,197
This is where we make the ethanol,

346
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,991
and Bob is constantly tinkering

347
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,910
with the recipe to
deliver a high-octane brew.

348
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,704
It's got 20 times more kick

349
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,498
than the watered-down petrol
from outside the wall.

350
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:38,168
He's like the OPEC of The Sprawl.

351
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:41,046
And he's not in Frank's pocket?

352
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,715
They have an arrangement.

353
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,800
He provides fuel,

354
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:49,680
and Frank reciprocates
with protection and a few other perks.

355
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:52,474
We eat a little bit better than the rest.

356
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,664
You slept on it?

357
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,416
I did.

358
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:21,253
Let's say you have the skills.

359
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:28,761
Death Race is for sociopathic killers.

360
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:31,639
You gotta have gravel in your guts.

361
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:35,935
You have to live for the smell
of motor oil and high-octane fuel.

362
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,604
You gotta love the sound
of rubber on asphalt,

363
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,606
and the taste of blood in your mouth.

364
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:45,444
And when you go to sleep at night,
I mean that deep REM sleep,

365
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:49,448
the sound of bullets whizzing past
your head should give you comfort.

366
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:53,619
So, Mr. Strong and Silent,

367
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,538
you made of that stuff?

368
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:00,042
If I'm not, then I die, right?

369
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:05,799
So, you want a shot?

370
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,598
I'll get you a shot.

371
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:17,685
Tonight. Death Pit.

372
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,029
Be ready to fight!

373
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,336
<i>Welcome to the Death Pit,
you degenerate convicts.</i>

374
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,258
<i>Tonight's final Death Match promises
to be the bloodiest one yet.</i>

375
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,218
<i>The carnage is about to begin,</i>

376
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:55,597
<i>so, take your seats and get ready
for the wildest ride yet.</i>

377
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:15,909
Hello?

378
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:16,994
Hi, old friend.

379
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:18,787
Lists, my buddy, what you got for me?

380
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:20,372
There's a new guy.

381
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:24,209
This is his first Death Match,
but Baltimore Bob says he can fight.

382
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:25,294
Could be a challenger.

383
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,378
What's his story?

384
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:30,132
Connor Gibson, in for felony whatever.

385
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,134
Two counts, six counts, who's counting,

386
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,552
he's in here with the rest of us.

387
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:37,431
I wish I had a few more bullet points
for you, but he's a question mark.

388
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:41,143
Why don't you send me the link,
and I'll check him out.

389
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,270
Wait. Before you go,

390
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,899
<i>we're running short on spare parts,
bulk ammo, CAT 5 cable.</i>

391
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,275
Could you hook me up?

392
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,860
They'll be in on the next shipment.

393
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:51,278
<i>Adios, amigo.</i>

394
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,740
Okay, let's see what this kid's made of.

395
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,618
Warden, check it out.

396
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,328
What do you have?

397
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:02,122
They're transmitting a telecast
from the Death Pit.

398
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:05,292
It's the final Death Match.

399
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:20,099
Welcome to the final Death Match.

400
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:21,809
This one's simple easy.

401
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:27,773
It's called "Capture the Keys."
Here's the rules.

402
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:32,528
We're not here to see
some MMA submission bullshit.

403
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:37,074
We're here to see bone-blasting,

404
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,286
spine-shattering fun.

405
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:48,001
It's about kill.

406
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:55,342
It's about blood and bone.

407
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,719
Oh, man, somebody gonna get a citation!

408
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:02,391
We're not here to see some
fucking pussy tap out.

409
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:06,687
The one person who gets that set of keys

410
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:11,275
and sticks it in the ignition of that car,

411
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,319
wins the last spot in Death Race.

412
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:15,821
Yeah!

413
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:21,493
<i>Adiós,</i> suckers. Peace out.

414
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,695
Somebody call the police!

415
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:28,829
There's our challenger. You can't teach that.

416
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,927
Trash that motherfucker.

417
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:47,491
That pretty boy can punch!

418
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:50,535
Yeah, but can he drive?

419
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:54,873
Who cares, I want to know
if he fucks like he fights.

420
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,917
RIP that motherfucker!

421
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:07,844
Yeah!

422
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:52,264
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for the Butcher.</i>

423
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:56,768
<i>This mountain of a man has
a bellyful of killing under his belt.</i>

424
00:48:56,852 --> 00:49:00,772
<i>Having chalked up 67 body bags
on the kill board.</i>

425
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:03,150
<i>Submission is not his thing.</i>

426
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:06,820
<i>Good luck out there, Connor,
you got the keys,</i>

427
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:09,449
<i>do you have the balls?</i>

428
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:15,787
Side bet, this pretty boy
doesn't last a minute.

429
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,539
I'll take that action, <i>Mita.</i>

430
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:16,491
Down goes Frazier!

431
00:51:16,575 --> 00:51:19,202
- Shit.
- Unbelievable.

432
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:21,663
Hot dog! Made me feel young again, shit.

433
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:55,196
I got something for you, Frankenstein.
Got something for you, baby.

434
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,454
Bring the winner by for a talk.

435
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,999
With pleasure.

436
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:11,671
That's a bad motherfucker.

437
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:16,593
Wanna pay now, or shall I run up a tab?

438
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,722
- I'll pay now.
- Mmm.

439
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:00,345
Frank thought you might want a fresh shirt.

440
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:05,141
I thought you might want me.

441
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:08,770
I'm not into porn stars.

442
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:19,114
You can't pass this up.

443
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:25,745
I can.

444
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:35,755
He might have something to say about that.

445
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:55,066
If you think you can make a go of it

446
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:58,528
against Frankenstein, you're wrong.

447
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:02,240
I can barely handle him,
and I'm three times the man you are.

448
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:13,960
Pussy.

449
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:20,759
Was Carley hospitable?

450
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:22,343
Something like that.

451
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:28,475
You've impressed me, twice.
That's not easily done.

452
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:31,436
What are your first impressions
of The Sprawl?

453
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,229
Anarchy.

454
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:36,441
Any more than the outside world?

455
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:37,901
I think so.

456
00:54:44,574 --> 00:54:48,536
Do you think you can handle
being king of this mountain?

457
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:52,207
I'm just here to race.

458
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,375
Mmm-hmm.

459
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:57,462
Yes, but if you win, then what?

460
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:01,299
Are you ready to lead?
To make hard decisions?

461
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:09,349
The Sprawl is self-sustaining,
but it wasn't always this way.

462
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:12,227
When I arrived, it was a wasteland.

463
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:15,063
The Weyland corporation promoted The Sprawl

464
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:17,315
as an alternative to regular prison.

465
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:20,151
That was a lie.

466
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:24,072
The Sprawl was created as
an alternative to the death penalty.

467
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:29,160
They throw us cheese,
and expect us to act like rats.

468
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:33,122
They didn't expect us to evolve,

469
00:55:33,206 --> 00:55:36,417
but we are, and we will.

470
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:40,588
I keep this place from anarchy.

471
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:43,091
What does this have to do with a street race?

472
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:48,263
It's not just a street race,
it is who we are.

473
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:52,267
Who are you, Connor Gibson?

474
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:56,104
Nobody special.

475
00:55:56,187 --> 00:56:00,024
All that could change if you win
Death Race, if you defeat me.

476
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:03,778
Why would you be willing
to risk losing all this power?

477
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:07,448
Death Race gives anyone
the opportunity to become king.

478
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:11,035
Without that to inspire, we're nothing.

479
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:15,456
If you win, what would be
your first act as king?

480
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,585
Haven't really thought about it.

481
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:22,505
I won because I knew exactly
what I wanted to do

482
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:24,257
when I was king of this hill.

483
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:27,886
If you don't know what you want,
you'll die on the track,

484
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:30,388
and The Sprawl will cheer your death.

485
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,432
So, the question is,

486
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:34,809
what do you want?

487
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,211
Come on, baby, get in.

488
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:10,011
That was insane tonight.

489
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:12,221
The answer's no, Bexie.

490
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:16,017
You don't want to ride shotgun in Death Race.

491
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,478
Yes, I do.

492
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:20,438
It's a death sentence.

493
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:23,316
Frank's killed people I care about.

494
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,401
I wanna be part of putting him down.

495
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:34,827
I'll think about it.

496
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:18,246
I thought we could have a drink.

497
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:30,925
So, who's Merry?

498
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:35,722
She your favorite groupie,
or you're just really into Christmas?

499
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:41,477
It's my sister, Meredith.

500
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,438
She died when I was in the service.

501
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:47,692
Never got to say goodbye.

502
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,903
I can't change it, so, I...

503
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,913
I've seen a lot of bad stuff.
Done a lot of bad things.

504
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:03,666
Merry was good.

505
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,127
Better than me, that's for sure.

506
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:11,883
I was...

507
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:14,927
I was born in Little Rock.

508
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,097
Son of a preacher man.

509
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:20,224
Hardly.

510
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:23,728
My old man was a grease monkey
in a pair of coveralls.

511
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:27,065
His idea of a good time
was drinking Dixie Beer on the porch,

512
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,525
and counting the fireflies.

513
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:37,158
Spent most of my young life in Sweetwater,
Texas, on a salvage yard.

514
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:43,414
Merry passed away in Long Beach.

515
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:45,333
That's how I ended up there.

516
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,201
So, the good news is,
it's a V-8 standard transmission and it runs,

517
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:23,579
but the bad news is,
well, it needs tires, brakes,

518
01:00:23,663 --> 01:00:26,541
a total engine overhaul,
fuel cell, armor, weapons...

519
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,876
Man, don't bore me with a list.

520
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,170
Bottom line, it needs everything.

521
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:33,965
What the hell's this thing?

522
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:36,217
Your tombstone.

523
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,720
Bulletproof titanium plate,
protects your fuel cell.

524
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:42,932
You got a navigator yet?

525
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:45,852
Hell yeah, he does!

526
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:49,105
I'm the motherfucker riding shotgun.

527
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:51,858
The hell you looking at?

528
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,610
I got antifreeze in my veins.

529
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:58,030
Let's build this shit.

530
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,711
The speedometer's been calibrated
at 200 miles per hour.

531
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:37,004
Think that's all she's got?

532
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:39,465
Let's find out.

533
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:45,596
This Death Race is one lap, one day.

534
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,683
The race begins and ends at the Air Field.

535
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:51,185
A lot of speed here, few obstacles.

536
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:58,317
The second leg is on Interstate 94.

537
01:02:58,401 --> 01:03:02,113
Most of the lesser cars will be
taken out on this long stretch here.

538
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,992
Watch out for the highway gangs,
this is their turf.

539
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:09,495
And then, you hit The Projects.

540
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,914
All kind of bad boys in there.

541
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:15,876
If you come out of there alive,

542
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,713
you end up in the Meat-Packing District.

543
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:20,006
Home free.

544
01:03:22,425 --> 01:03:24,427
<i>Driving is more important than killing.</i>

545
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:28,723
Shoot only when you must.
Think slow, drive fast.

546
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:34,145
Rule number one, keep your ass alive.

547
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:19,732
That was incredible.

548
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:21,734
Don't fucking touch me.

549
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:01,524
Hi.

550
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:10,533
So, you like cars?

551
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:15,830
Yeah. I like American Muscle.

552
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:20,209
I had a 'Vette.

553
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:23,754
Rebuilt it myself.

554
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,174
A 1970 LT-1.

555
01:05:27,425 --> 01:05:28,426
Mmm.

556
01:05:29,385 --> 01:05:30,469
Stingray.

557
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:34,640
Used to love to open her up
on the highway to Vegas.

558
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:39,478
Pedal to the floor, 370 horses running hard.

559
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:41,730
Holley and Rochester Quadrajet carb

560
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:43,899
getting the mixture just right.

561
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:48,154
Momentum shift, stay off the brakes,
get her on her toes.

562
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:52,241
Man, could she fly.

563
01:05:53,576 --> 01:05:56,495
I bet you talk like this to all your girls.

564
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,544
I got nothing outside these walls.

565
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:09,091
Merry was my last connection
to anything real.

566
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:12,845
So, when she died,

567
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:17,892
I made a bad decision,

568
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:22,730
wound up here, not caring
about anything or anyone.

569
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:31,572
But now...

570
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:38,412
But now?

571
01:08:12,548 --> 01:08:14,925
We're coming for you!

572
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:18,012
We're coming for you, boy!

573
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:30,417
Sergeant Gibson.

574
01:09:31,543 --> 01:09:33,837
No one's called me that in a long time.

575
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:38,175
Connor Gibson is not the man
we are coming to know.

576
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:39,426
He is a warrior,

577
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:44,556
a very decorated and specialized warrior.

578
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,603
Known in the shadow world of government
killers for his wet work with the CIA.

579
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:54,108
Targeted killing is his forte,
and I am his mark.

580
01:09:55,401 --> 01:09:58,362
He's here at the behest
of Weyland International.

581
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:01,407
Sent here by the fascists from the outside

582
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,784
because they think
I've gained too much power.

583
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,120
They fitted him with a strap,

584
01:10:06,704 --> 01:10:09,540
and he hangs around
their waist like a hatchet.

585
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:12,918
There's a helicopter ride to freedom

586
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,129
waiting for him at the finish line.

587
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:19,425
Tell me, Sergeant, am I wrong?

588
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:21,719
Kill! Kill! Kill!

589
01:10:21,802 --> 01:10:23,887
Kill! Kill! Kill!

590
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:25,973
Kill! Kill! Kill!

591
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:30,644
Kill him!

592
01:10:30,728 --> 01:10:32,688
Sergeant Gibson...

593
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:34,148
Traitor!

594
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:36,358
...will be allowed to race.

595
01:10:36,442 --> 01:10:39,111
Fuck that, Frank! What if he wins?

596
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:43,532
Then he wins! And that is what's meant to be.

597
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,910
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

598
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:55,753
So, tell me, who's hiding behind
the mask now,

599
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:58,672
me or you?

600
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:02,176
See you on the starting line.

601
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,473
Stupid traitor.

602
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:09,516
Hope he dies. Semper Fi anyway, man.

603
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:22,446
Is it true?

604
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:29,953
Goodbye, Long Beach.

605
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:31,830
Jane, please.

606
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:37,669
Get your goddamn hands off of me.

607
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:50,057
I'm still one of your pit crew.

608
01:11:50,766 --> 01:11:53,477
I don't care if they have
sent you to kill him, or not.

609
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,978
He's a liar, Bob!

610
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:57,064
A liar who's working for the man.

611
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:58,357
Get over it.

612
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:02,069
He's good for business.

613
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:04,404
We've got a race to get ready for.

614
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,119
Get your head right, convict.

615
01:12:13,247 --> 01:12:16,166
Your life depends on it.

616
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:16,810
You gotta love race day.

617
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:28,572
<i>Are you ready, motherfuckers!</i>

618
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:33,785
<i>I can't hear you,
you bunch of fucking pussies!</i>

619
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,838
<i>Here they are!</i>

620
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:53,305
<i>Welcome to Death Race,
the ultimate in auto carnage.</i>

621
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:55,849
<i>One day, 11 drivers,</i>

622
01:13:55,933 --> 01:14:00,562
<i>four stages, and over
250 live camera feeds...</i>

623
01:14:00,646 --> 01:14:02,981
Just like clockwork, Mr. Valentine.

624
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:06,902
This is it, last chance,
Frankenstein dies, or your career dies.

625
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:09,905
Frankenstein will be
in a body bag by day's end.

626
01:14:09,988 --> 01:14:11,990
I hope so, for your sake.

627
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:19,706
<i>Let's talk about the bad boys
and girls that run this race.</i>

628
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:23,418
Did you call the cops?
'Cause I didn't fucking... I didn't call...

629
01:14:23,502 --> 01:14:26,088
<i>Featuring three-time racer, Johnny Law,</i>

630
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:27,506
<i>and his monster police cruiser.</i>

631
01:14:28,382 --> 01:14:31,176
<i>He's here to protect and serve.</i>

632
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:33,553
Mornin', motherfuckers.

633
01:14:33,804 --> 01:14:36,640
<i>Two-time racer, The Fireman
and his Dodge Ram Hemi.</i>

634
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:39,685
<i>His ass is coming through your door.</i>

635
01:14:39,768 --> 01:14:41,228
Come show mama some love.

636
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:45,232
<i>Queen bitch of The Sprawl, Matilda The Hun,</i>

637
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:48,235
<i>sporting her school bus yellow Econoline van.</i>

638
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:53,615
<i>And first-timer, Gipsy Rose,
and her badass Mini Cooper S.</i>

639
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:57,661
<i>With a face only a mother could love,</i>

640
01:14:57,744 --> 01:15:00,080
<i>here's Pierced-Face and his VW Bug.</i>

641
01:15:05,043 --> 01:15:08,588
<i>Nazi Bastard and his
blood-thirsty truck from hell.</i>

642
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:12,300
<i>Dirt and his Formula-1 War Cycle,</i>

<i>counting on speed to keep him alive.</i>

<i>He didn't come here to rest in peace.</i>

<i>And last, but definitely least,</i>

649
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:39,077
<i>our resident rat fuck, Sergeant Gibson,

650

<i>He's got a bull's eye on his back.</i>

651
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:58,972
You ready for our play-date?

652
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:11,985
You got the whole world coming after you,
my man, you know that, right?

653
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:16,907
Take a walk, Bexie, I got this.

654
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:21,203
I should, but who am I to judge?

655
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:24,664
I ain't here to throw shade on you.

656
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:28,502
I'm sure you got reasons.

657
01:16:30,962 --> 01:16:34,674
So, if it's all the same, I'll ride with you.

658
01:16:42,808 --> 01:16:45,519
<i>Now, give it up for your champion,</i>

659
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:48,772
<i>returning to the track

660

<i>Frankenstein!</i>

662
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:56,780
Frank, I got your number, baby!

663
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:02,160
Frank, baby!

664
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:24,182
Sometimes, I get the feeling
Frank is playing chess,

665
01:17:24,266 --> 01:17:27,102
and the rest of us are playing checkers.

666
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:32,274
Let her go, Frank, she's got nothing
to do with any of this.

667
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:37,070
No, but she's a good insurance policy.

668
01:17:39,406 --> 01:17:41,950
Let's see how cold-blooded you are.

669
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:50,167
Put her in the car.

670
01:17:51,543 --> 01:17:53,253

675
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:29,456
We should fuck her after the race.

676
01:18:37,547 --> 01:18:39,132
Let's light this fire!

677
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:45,972
Now, go back and strap your sweet
little ass in that chair, girl.

678

Come on!

Whoa!

681
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:46,760
One down, 10 to go.

682
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:54,726
This is gonna be the biggest payday ever.

683
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:26,132
Hey, Bexie, do me a favor and get
those motherfuckers off my ass.

684
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,222
Let's blow some shit up.

685
01:21:49,781 --> 01:21:53,326
Find me someone that will give me
some action on Connor Gibson.

686
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:55,578
And tell them I'm all in.

687

<i>Nine drivers remain,

690

<i>and we're just getting warmed up.</i>

691
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:25,692
Yeah!

692
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:46,546
You are going down,
you sodomite motherfucker!

693
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:49,382
Take him out!

694
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:58,933
Fuck you, Fireman!

695
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:19,078
Yeah!

696
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:39,849
Now, that's a waste of some good pussy!

697
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:43,019

once and for all.

702
01:23:57,283 --> 01:23:58,326
Arming missiles.

703
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:02,372
Let's see if your boyfriend's
ready to bury you.

704
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:03,456
Don't do it.

705
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,543
Let her go, Connor,
that skinny bitch ain't never coming back.

706
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:07,752
I said don't do it.

707
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:15,969
Just what I thought.

708
01:24:55,842 --> 01:24:57,385
Fucking <i>Los Muertos.</i>

709
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,016
Fuck!

710
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:06,728
Suck on this, dickface!

711

<i>Hold onto your titties, bitches!</i>

712
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,721
Six Death Racers left.

713
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:47,018
Let's go!

714
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:51,189
Who the hell brings a VW bus to a Death Race?

715
01:25:51,272 --> 01:25:52,940
You gotta hand it to these degenerates.

716
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,484
They put on a hell of a show.

717
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:14,962
Our tombstone can't hold out much longer.

718
01:26:26,516 --> 01:26:28,857
<i>Somebody call 911!</i>

719
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:31,354

720
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:50,623
Missed, motherfucker!

721
01:27:05,221 --> 01:27:06,556
Fish on!

722
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:07,640
We're hooked.

723
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,854
Hang on, Bexie, I got an idea.

724
01:27:25,867 --> 01:27:28,661
What are you doing, motherfucker?

725
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:50,516
Here, fishy, fishy.

726
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,353
Come out and play.

727
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:01,861

728
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:45,738
<i>Fuck me, this traitor and his bitch,

<i>Only five Death Racers left

<i>Frankenstein is still in the lead,</i>

731
01:28:50,326 --> 01:28:52,119
<i>with Gipsy Rose a close second,</i>

732
01:28:52,245 --> 01:28:55,289
<i>and Connor Gibson's eating

733
01:29:32,285 --> 01:29:33,452
Fucking Death Race!

734
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:13,492
Hey, you!

735
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:15,912
Did you do this?

736
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:19,999
No, we did!

737
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:22,501
Just the man I was gunnin' for.

738
01:30:24,587 --> 01:30:26,589
How ya doin', Wonder Bread?

739
01:30:28,549 --> 01:30:30,343
Stupid motherfucker!

740
01:30:33,012 --> 01:30:35,056
<i>Fick dich, Schwarzer!</i>

741
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:37,099
Oh, no, he didn't!

742
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:39,310
Did he just say what I think he said?

743
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:41,896
Yeah, but in German.

744
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:45,608
Whoo!

745
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,903
You and your bitch brought your skinhead shit

746
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:51,781
to the wrong part of town.

747
01:30:54,692 --> 01:30:56,410
Get ready to play!

748
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:35,908
We gotta reroute him over the bridge.

749
01:31:35,992 --> 01:31:37,702
He's too far out to win this race.

750
01:31:38,744 --> 01:31:39,996
I'm not telling him.

751
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:41,539
Get him online.

752
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:44,750
<i>Talk to me, Bob.</i>

753
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:46,752
We need to reroute you over the bridge.

754
01:31:46,836 --> 01:31:47,837
The bridge is out.

755
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,547
Why the fuck are you rerouting me there?

756
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:52,258
You're too far behind,
you have to jump the gap.

757
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:54,552
What are we talking about, like 50 feet?

758
01:31:54,635 --> 01:31:56,929
More like, 250 feet.

759
01:31:57,013 --> 01:31:59,015
That's your only chance if you wanna win.

760
01:31:59,098 --> 01:32:00,141
I have to win.

761
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:27,710
<i>No one's gonna shed a tear for Nazi
Bastard and his nasty little</i> Fräulein.

762
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:31,839
<i>I mean, boo-hoo, it's not
a real loss to the planet Earth.</i>

763
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:33,549
<i>Four drivers remain.</i>

764
01:32:33,632 --> 01:32:36,385
<i>Frankenstein and Gipsy Rose
have opened up a big lead</i>

765
01:32:36,469 --> 01:32:38,721
<i>on Johnny Law and Connor Gibson.</i>

766
01:32:56,489 --> 01:32:58,199
So, how do we do this, Bob?

767
01:32:58,282 --> 01:33:02,995
You've gotta hit the gap at 220 miles
an hour. There's a ramp there.

768
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:05,122
It's not the first time this has been tried.

769
01:33:05,206 --> 01:33:07,833
Nah, we're only calibrated
to 200 miles an hour.

770
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:09,543
Don't worry, she'll get you up to 220.

771
01:33:09,627 --> 01:33:11,212
Anyone ever made this jump before?

772
01:33:12,088 --> 01:33:14,715
On paper, the math works.

773
01:33:20,179 --> 01:33:21,263
What about the landing?

774
01:33:21,347 --> 01:33:23,432
Well, I ain't gonna lie to you,
it's gonna be a hard one.

775
01:33:23,516 --> 01:33:26,435
If you get your angle right, you might live.

776
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:28,020
Yeah, fuck you very much.

777
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:32,316
That rat fuck is back.

778
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:43,661
Punk-ass bitch!

779
01:33:50,543 --> 01:33:51,544
That worked well.

780
01:34:08,936 --> 01:34:10,604
Yeah!

781
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:16,735
Okay, let's get this done already.

782
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:22,074
<i>Take your next left,
the bridge is five miles out.</i>

783
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:23,200
That's your only chance.

784
01:34:23,284 --> 01:34:24,535
You like this play, Bob?

785
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,537
It's your only play.

786
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,205
I'll see you on the other side.

787
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:39,925
You should get out, Bexie.
We're all out of road.

788
01:34:40,968 --> 01:34:42,761
Not fucking happening.

789
01:34:43,262 --> 01:34:45,890
The minute I got in this car
with you, I was all in.

790
01:34:47,975 --> 01:34:52,438
So, let's do this. It's just gravity.

791
01:35:09,663 --> 01:35:11,248
We're maxing out at 209.

792
01:35:11,332 --> 01:35:12,499
I'm dropping the tombstone.

793
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,072
Come on, come on.

794
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:45,467
Yeah!

795
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:48,012
Yeah, all right!

796
01:36:48,095 --> 01:36:49,555
Told you the math worked.

797
01:36:53,934 --> 01:36:55,728
I could suck you off right now.

798
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:01,483
<i>I can't believe what I just saw.</i>

799
01:37:01,567 --> 01:37:02,818
<i>Connor Gibson jumped the bridge,</i>

800
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:04,778
<i>putting him right back in the thick of it.</i>

801
01:37:04,862 --> 01:37:07,656
<i>Motherfucker got game.</i>

802
01:37:08,949 --> 01:37:12,745
Come on, kid, don't let me down!
You gotta win this race.

803
01:37:24,256 --> 01:37:26,008
Here comes your boyfriend.

804
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:29,845
Hey, Bex, patch me through to Frank.

805
01:37:37,644 --> 01:37:38,771
<i>Hey, Frankie.</i>

806
01:37:39,396 --> 01:37:42,775
Hey, Connor, glad you showed
for your date with destiny.

807
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:44,902
I knew it'd come down to us.

808
01:37:44,985 --> 01:37:46,779
I wouldn't have it any other way.

809
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:50,449
<i>We can start shooting
at each other, or we can drive.</i>

810
01:37:50,783 --> 01:37:52,117
<i>What do you prefer?</i>

811
01:37:52,201 --> 01:37:53,452
Let's drive.

812
01:38:21,855 --> 01:38:25,025
We're running out of time,
take him out already!

813
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:38,872
What's going on?

814
01:38:44,086 --> 01:38:45,295
His fuel cell's empty.

815
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:56,181
What the fuck! Drive, Connor!

816
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:00,018
We're out of gas.

817
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:23,208
Fuel line's ruptured.

818
01:40:03,165 --> 01:40:07,711
Don't do it.
Just turn around and win your race.

819
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:12,257
This is Death Race. He has to die.

820
01:40:14,259 --> 01:40:16,428
He knows it.

821
01:40:17,638 --> 01:40:19,264
He chose it.

822
01:41:21,952 --> 01:41:23,537
All right!

823
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:29,585
That's our cue, send in the chopper.

824
01:41:29,668 --> 01:41:31,003
It's already en route.

825
01:41:39,553 --> 01:41:40,846
Get the fuck out of here!

826
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:46,310
I got you, I got you, Jane.

827
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:52,024
Jam the broadcast to the Dark Web.

828
01:41:52,107 --> 01:41:53,900
But this is good stuff...

829
01:41:53,984 --> 01:41:55,902
Just do it! Cut it for five minutes.

830
01:42:00,907 --> 01:42:02,284
Shit.

831
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:09,708
This is what the Warden wants.

832
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,877
He wants Frank's death on display.

833
01:42:12,628 --> 01:42:16,965
We give it to him, we lose.

834
01:42:17,049 --> 01:42:18,216
Fuck him.

835
01:42:35,317 --> 01:42:37,444
Job's done, let's go.

836
01:42:38,904 --> 01:42:40,238
Hold on.

837
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:49,790
They sent two of us?

838
01:42:49,915 --> 01:42:54,586
Insurance. Pretty wild, huh?

839
01:42:55,629 --> 01:42:57,047
And thanks for the assist.

840
01:42:58,006 --> 01:43:01,176
Everybody was so focused on you,
I flew under the radar.

841
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:04,012
Let's get the fuck out of this shit hole.

842
01:43:04,096 --> 01:43:07,599
Frankenstein's dead, job well done.

843
01:43:11,937 --> 01:43:13,313
Oh, and, by the way,

844
01:43:15,023 --> 01:43:17,109
we're all square, now.

845
01:43:19,528 --> 01:43:22,280
Twenty seconds, and I'm gone.

846
01:44:11,997 --> 01:44:13,957
<i>Connor, listen up.</i>

847
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:17,669
Put on the mask, become Frankenstein.

848
01:44:18,211 --> 01:44:21,506
<i>The Sprawl will never follow Connor Gibson.</i>

849
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:24,551
They follow Frankenstein.

850
01:44:24,634 --> 01:44:27,971
Without him, chaos.

851
01:44:57,042 --> 01:44:59,544
Let's finish this race, Long Beach.

852
01:46:22,002 --> 01:46:25,881
Now, put Death Race back online.

853
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,846
Goldberg's gonna be pissed.
He put heavy action on Connor.

854
01:46:32,929 --> 01:46:34,556
Easy come, easy go.

855
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:42,898
Fuck you, Valentine.

856
01:46:57,746 --> 01:46:58,747
Yeah!

857
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:04,210
Yeah!

857
01:47:05,305 --> 01:48:05,164
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
