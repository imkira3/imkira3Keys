1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,740
My love.

3
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,117
Cara mia.

4
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,203
The ring! The ring!
Oh, no! No, no, no!

5
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,256
Oh, Thing.
Best hand always has the ring.

6
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,894
Dearly be-loathed,

7
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:11,191
it is indeed a rare privilege
to see our family gathered together

8
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,610
for this Addams tradition.

9
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,904
To commence this ceremony

10
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:21,659
and deliver these two
into the yawning void of matrimony,

11
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,953
we put the lime in the coconut

12
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,331
and drink them both up.

13
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,924
I now pronounce you...

14
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,717
- Monster!
- Freak!

15
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,804
- You've been here long enough!
- We've had enough of your kind!

16
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,639
Addams aren't wanted here!

17
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,099
Leave already!

18
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,642
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

19
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,894
Quick, put the lime in the coconut
and drink them both up.

20
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,609
Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

21
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,236
This is our home!

22
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,741
Everyone, to the bridge!

23
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,871
Fire!

24
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:27,725
You two love-bats better fly out of here.
I'll hold them off.

25
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,102
Mazurka!

26
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,024
Grab onto my hairy hump!

27
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,657
I think I can see my house from here.

28
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,951
Oh, no, that's a women's prison.

29
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:46,744
Oh, Gomez.

30
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,998
Why do hordes of angry villagers
follow us everywhere we go?

31
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,668
We are safe, my love.
That is all that matters.

32
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,505
I want to find a new home
that is shrouded from the world.

33
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,508
Someplace that is truly us.

34
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,677
Yes! Somewhere horrible!

35
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,220
Somewhere corrupt!

36
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:08,475
Somewhere that no one in their right mind
would be caught dead in!

37
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,695
Unhappy, darling?

38
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,114
Yes. Completely.

39
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,784
Oh, Gomez, you have torn down my walls

40
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,496
and stabbed your name onto my heart.

41
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:35,752
My wan temptress.
Your hand is as cold as a dead fish.

42
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,047
My love, that is a dead fish.

43
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,758
So it is.

44
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:51,851
Darling? Is that a wrinkle I see
on your pallid brow?

45
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,394
What's wrong?

46
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,480
We can't run forever, my love.

47
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,315
I want a home again.

48
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,443
I want our children to grow up in peace.

49
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,445
I want to pick out cemetery plots.

50
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,741
Morticia, I swear on my life
I will find us a new home.

51
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,826
And your every wish shall be granted.

52
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,037
Mon amour.

53
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,539
French?

54
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,874
You know what that does to me.

55
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,043
Nouveau riche.

56
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,754
Je ne sais quoi.

57
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,267
- We hit something.
- We hit something.

58
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,276
Is he all right?

59
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,654
No, he seems perfectly demented.

60
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,700
State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane.

61
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:49,993
Gomez?

62
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,915
That must be the asylum.

63
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,919
Oh, thank goodness.
A decent place to sleep for the night.

64
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,761
Thank you, old boy. Lead the way.

65
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,449
It's quiet. Too quiet.

66
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,284
Must be the off-season.

67
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,169
Hello?

68
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,507
There's no one here.

69
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,217
Could it be abandoned?

70
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,053
It's creepy.

71
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,639
- Kooky.
- Mysterious.

72
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,390
Spooky.

73
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:57,161
Get out!

74
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,414
It's hideous.

75
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,748
It's horrible.

76
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,000
- It's home.
- It's home.

77
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,107
What a lovely morning!

78
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,904
Nice try.

79
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,866
Get out!

80
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:01,828
Oh, you're always so grumpy
before your morning coffee.

81
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,463
Better.

82
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,066
Lurch, it's time for breakfast.

83
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,253
Thing.

84
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,715
Have Ichabod wake the children.

85
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,637
Lurch, would you mind dusting the house?

86
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,982
Slowly, Cleopatra.

87
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,068
I wouldn't want
my favorite African Strangler to choke.

88
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,072
All right, Ichabod. I'm awake.

89
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,365
Not for long!

90
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,035
Real mature, Pugsley.

91
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,705
Oh, please. You never threw an ax
when you were my age?

92
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,290
Of course I did.

93
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,042
I never missed.

94
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,215
How I wish something would liven up
this already tedious day.

95
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,137
Thanks for trying, Ichabod.

96
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,730
Pugsley? Pugsley?

97
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,606
It's time for sword practice.

98
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,275
Pugsley?

99
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,943
Let the games begin.

100
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,973
Here's Pugsley!

101
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,159
All right, son. That's enough.

102
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,081
Ah, they blow up so fast these days.

103
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,843
Don't make me come up there!

104
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,143
This is your last warning!

105
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,782
My head.

106
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,703
Pugsley, we're supposed to be working
on your swordplay.

107
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,958
Your Sabre Mazurka is two weeks away,
and you've barely practiced at all.

108
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,168
So I missed one practice.
What's the big deal?

109
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,045
The big deal?

110
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,882
The Sabre Mazurka is the most
important day in a young man's life.

111
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,467
It's what makes you an Addams.

112
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,595
It's the day your entire family
gathers around you

113
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,723
and passes judgment on your worth
as a human being.

114
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,684
I hear it's like Thanksgiving.

115
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,603
But swords are so old-fashioned.

116
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,397
I'm more of a demolitions man.

117
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,817
Explosives have no place in a mazurka.

118
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,985
Hand them over.

119
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,698
All of them.

120
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,950
And the TNT.

121
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,452
And the M-80s.

122
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,706
Roman candles. Bang snaps.
Holy hand grenades.

123
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,712
Son, our family hasn't been all together
in 13 years.

124
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:49,175
They are coming from all over the world
to see you on your special day.

125
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,135
I just want it to go perfectly.

126
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,263
All right, Pop. I'll practice.

127
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,723
That's my boy.

128
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,732
- Putrid.
- Horrifying.

129
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,358
I call spleen.

130
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,073
Wednesday, please,
no ink stains on the table.

131
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,325
Yes, Mother.

132
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,041
Gomez, everyone we've invited
to the mazurka has threatened to come.

133
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,251
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

134
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,839
All Addamses under one roof again.

135
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,175
Yes. But where will everyone sleep?

136
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,554
We'll have Lurch fix up the mausoleum.
It'll be like sleepaway camp.

137
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,641
Very well, darling.

138
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,312
- Uncle Fester!
- Uncle Fester!

139
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,897
Brother!

140
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,528
Don't worry, I'm okay.
The plate glass window broke my fall.

141
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,785
Rick 'em, rack 'em, roar 'em, buzz!
Addams is as Addams does!

142
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,665
I am thrilled you're here.

143
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,209
I'm not late, am I?

144
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,878
Actually, we weren't expecting you
for another two weeks.

145
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:11,423
- So, not late.
- I apologize, darling.

146
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,803
You see, I asked Fester to come early
to help Pugsley with his mazurka plans.

147
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:16,929
Hey!

148
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,515
No! No! Bad Kitty!

149
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,016
That's a bad Kitty!

150
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,061
If I'd known you were coming,
I would've prepared the dungeon.

151
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,814
Please, don't worry.
I'll sleep in the attic.

152
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,691
You won't even know I'm here.

153
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:33,153
I've practiced that move
in a lot of people's homes.

154
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,324
Uncle, can you tell us
what's beyond the gate?

155
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,080
Why ever would you ask that, dear?

156
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,708
I heard a strange noise
in the fog earlier,

157
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,293
and I should like to investigate.

158
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,586
There's nothing out there
but boring marshland.

159
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,840
There must be something.
We never go anywhere.

160
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,676
Who knows the untold horrors
we're missing out on?

161
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,679
Darling, we have all the horror
we need right here.

162
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,307
Uncle Fester can go wherever he likes.

163
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,642
Now, now, there are some restrictions.

164
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,604
You know, I can't go to the mall or a zoo
or a building...

165
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,441
When you're older,
you can travel to your heart's content.

166
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,402
But for now, it's safer for you here.

167
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,488
Socrates, come.

168
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:21,869
Mexico, no-go.
South America, Europe, China, Asia.

169
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,620
Most parts of Africa.

170
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,622
I'm allowed in Antarctica.

171
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:42,222
You're watching
Home Art & Garden Television.

172
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,852
The world's a big place full of poor souls

173
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,980
who don't know the difference
between shiplap and Shinola.

174
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,607
Well, I'm here to help.

175
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,320
I take your uninspired living space

176
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,365
and turn it into the perfect palace
of your dreams.

177
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:03,202
No matter how outdated
your design sense, I can help you.

178
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,831
My only flaw?
Sometimes I care too much.

179
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,542
I'm Margaux Needler,

180
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,505
and I'm about to stage
a design intervention!

181
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,173
You're welcome in advance.

182
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,928
Today we're putting the finishing touches
on our biggest project yet.

183
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,554
Assimilation.

184
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,681
We didn't just make over a house.

185
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,267
We made over a whole town!

186
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,063
And in just two weeks
on our live season finale,

187
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,941
you will be able to buy
your very own piece of Assimilation.

188
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,067
That's right.

189
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,777
In a Design Intervention first,

190
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,489
we are putting a whole neighborhood
up for sale.

191
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,575
This will be your chance
to purchase the house of your dreams

192
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,619
in the town of your dreams.

193
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,913
Sounds good? I thought so.

194
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,833
Welcome to Assimilation, neighbor.

195
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,836
This program brought to you
by Neighborhood Peeps.

196
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,088
Your neighbors are watching.

197
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,549
And we're out.

198
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,177
Lovely. Perfect.
Let's set up for the walk-through.

199
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,012
Margaux, did that feel good to you?

200
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,641
No, Glenn. We need more balloons,
more confetti.

201
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,685
- Roger that.
- What are we selling here?

202
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,145
Big dreams.

203
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,106
You know how you get big dreams?
With big ratings.

204
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,274
- Got it.
- Double the balloons.

205
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,235
And I want a blizzard of confetti.
I want so much confetti

206
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,946
that we need snow patrols
to find lost children.

207
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,990
I bet my home improvement empire
on this town.

208
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,993
Every house must sell
or we're out of business.

209
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,578
It's got to be perfect.

210
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,914
- Mom! You're never gonna believe this.
- What is it, Parker?

211
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,459
I found a creepy mansion up on the hill.

212
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,127
I'm so glad you're exploring, Parker,

213
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,337
but I don't have time to talk
right now, sweetheart.

214
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,672
Mama needs to help people.

215
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,467
I need help. Aren't I people?

216
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:45,053
You're cute. Don't you have
chipper 'n' cheer practice this afternoon?

217
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,388
Run along, honey.

218
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,640
Now, Glenn, what are the numbers
we're expecting?

219
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:49,850
Mom!

220
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,822
Left a bit, up a bit.

221
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,200
Now down a bit.

222
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,660
Perfect.

223
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:13,832
And three, two, one...

224
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,672
You made me miss.

225
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:24,259
Do you know how long it took
for me to set this up?

226
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:27,679
Look, Pugsley, your mazurka's coming up,

227
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,182
and, well, you're not ready...

228
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,893
even if I am the only one who sees it.

229
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,978
So, pay attention,

230
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,563
and you might actually get through this.

231
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:40,359
Wait. You're going to help me?

232
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,236
Why?

233
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,363
Because you are my brother.

234
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:49,117
And... I love... you.

235
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,458
All right. How are you gonna help me?

236
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,043
You see that hole over there?

237
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,962
Go stand beside it.

238
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,966
- That hole?
- That hole.

239
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,176
I don't get it.

240
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,028
Darling, not to criticize,

241
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,114
but is that really as tight
as you can make it?

242
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,949
I'm sorry, Gomez.

243
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:32,244
I'm just a bit preoccupied
with the mazurka preparations.

244
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,871
Oh, I am as well.

245
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,249
I feel Pugsley is overconfident

246
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:41,878
and doesn't truly understand
the importance of this tradition.

247
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,797
Good news, everybody. Pugsley's gone.

248
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,383
Wednesday, I know that tone of voice.

249
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,343
Dig up your brother at once.

250
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,387
You're weakening the gene pool.

251
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,389
Hold on. What do you have there?

252
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,767
I'm not sure. I like it.

253
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,853
It's so... What's the word?

254
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,022
Opposite of sad?

255
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,898
Darling, bring that to me.

256
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,986
Strange.

257
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,365
There's usually a murderous clown
attached to the other end of these.

258
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,201
Wednesday, don't move.

259
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:18,248
What in the name of
all that is unholy is that?

260
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,543
It tastes like cotton candy.

261
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,462
How do you know what
cotton candy tastes like?

262
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,006
Tish, it was my youth.
I made mistakes.

263
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,842
Wednesday, wherever did
this pink thing come from?

264
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:32,054
Outside. They're everywhere.

265
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,481
Strangest weather system I've ever seen.

266
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,072
What is that?

267
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,658
- Where's it coming from?
- Wait, wait, wait.

268
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,535
The fog. It's lifting.

269
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,412
Well, that would only happen if...

270
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,999
Someone drained the marsh.
But who?

271
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:06,380
A town. This is not good.

272
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,508
We must go down there
and introduce ourselves at once.

273
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:13,553
This day is becoming
most wonderfully disruptive.

274
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,111
Let's keep going
with the run-through, okay?

275
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,947
Welcome back. I'm so delighted
to show you my house.

276
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,075
You can own one just like it,
just less large.

277
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,911
Blah, blah, blah.
Sconces, crown molding.

278
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,123
Which leads us to what I call
the salon de grandé.

279
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:45,919
Cross here, turn, then say something like,
now, before I show you this view,

280
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:50,173
go to an antiques store,
buy a chair and reupholster it.

281
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,300
'Cause you're gonna want
to sit down for this.

282
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,515
What? What's the matter?
For heaven's sake, what's going on?

283
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,225
Do I have something in my teeth?

284
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,435
What is it?

285
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:11,945
Not a single gargoyle.

286
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:16,074
Maybe this isn't such a bad thing.
We have been isolated here for a while.

287
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,785
I can really see myself
dying here!

288
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,748
Play nice, Kitty!

289
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,585
Well, no one is running at us
with torches and pitchforks,

290
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,003
so that's a plus.

291
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:33,133
You know, darling, I don't think we'll
need to put the family in the mausoleum.

292
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,509
They can stay here.

293
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,179
The family will never be comfortable.

294
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,056
It will be years
before rust and decay set in.

295
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,141
How you doing?

296
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,019
It's all so different.

297
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,272
Pugsley, don't drink it all.

298
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,316
This gentleman wants some too.

299
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:53,153
Sir, it's all right.
He's had all his shots!

300
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,071
What a nervous man.

301
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:58,116
Come on, Tish.
Let's explore the neighborhood.

302
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,661
I'm gonna pop in here for two minutes,
and I'll meet you in the town square.

303
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,538
- Agreed?
- Very well, darling.

304
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,458
Good day, all.

305
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,088
Don't let me interrupt your cup of joe,
or whoever you have in there.

306
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:16,259
So, what's dark and bitter here,
other than yours truly?

307
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,847
We have the...
Madagascar Emerald Peaberry

308
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,349
in a summer patchouli roast.

309
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:26,353
It has notes of oak, cherry and yoga.

310
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:30,857
You know, I'm looking
for something a bit stronger.

311
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,151
Let me try that.

312
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,325
Morticia, you have to try
these coffee grounds.

313
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,785
They have a wonderful grit.

314
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,287
Just a moment. What am I hearing?

315
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,957
<i>Join the party,
this is where we all belong, yeah</i>

316
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:51,086
<i>Everybody come together,
sing our song, sing our song</i>

317
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:55,924
<i>Life is really perfect,
we are one big family, yeah</i>

318
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,761
<i>Everything is so much better
when I'm like you and you're like me</i>

319
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:04,140
<i>What's so great about being yourself</i>

320
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,394
<i>When you can be like everyone else</i>

321
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:11,731
That is absolutely horrible.

322
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:15,068
<i>It's easy to be happy
when you have no choice</i>

323
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:18,947
<i>Yes, it's easy to be happy
when you have no choice</i>

324
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,907
Hold on.
Unless I miss my guess here,

325
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:23,994
I believe that is supposed to be music.

326
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,621
They're greeting us
with one of their traditional songs.

327
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:30,375
- Then we ought to do the same.
- Wonderful idea, Fester.

328
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,502
<i>When we are all together</i>

329
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:36,131
<i>Say it again until you believe it</i>

330
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,466
<i>I believe it</i>

331
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,636
<i>We believe it</i>

332
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,057
<i>I'd tip my hat to you</i>

333
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,101
<i>I'd do just that,
bum, bum, bum</i>

334
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,644
<i>Take it right off for you</i>

335
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:52,188
<i>But I haven't got a hat,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum</i>

336
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:53,607
<i>I'm just a college boy</i>

337
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,026
<i>Even at that,
bum, bum, bum</i>

338
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,485
<i>I'd tip my hat to you</i>

339
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,695
<i>But I haven't got a hat</i>

340
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,238
<i>Bum, bum, bum, bum</i>

341
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,866
Oh, God!

342
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,412
What'd I do?

343
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,872
How rude.

344
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,166
Gomez, we should return home.

345
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,252
Morticia, this is not the old country.

346
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:16,755
True, these people are a little different.

347
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,633
But deep down we're all the same.

348
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:22,344
We have to give them a chance,
get to know them.

349
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,970
We have to win them over.

350
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,305
Win them over?

351
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,350
Well, good morning, neighbor.

352
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,226
Margaux Needler.

353
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,855
Gomez Addams, at your service.

354
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,274
- My wife Morticia.
- Charmed.

355
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,402
Our children, Wednesday, Pugsley.

356
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,987
And my brother Fester.

357
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:44,407
Hey, neighbor. You know,
we can see right into your windows.

358
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:47,202
It's nice to... meet you.

359
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,457
As your neighbor, I'd like to offer you
the opportunity of a lifetime.

360
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:57,420
How would you like a free home makeover
from a world-renowned interior designer?

361
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:01,132
It will be a challenge, but I could
beautify that old house of yours so fast,

362
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,467
it'll make your heads spin.

363
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,178
I don't want to brag,
but mine already does that. Look.

364
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,017
I should like to see what
this plastic woman has to offer.

365
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:13,895
Yes.
Well, when is a good time to stop by?

366
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,731
Actually, Miss Needler...

367
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:17,941
Darling?

368
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:21,444
Stop by anytime you'd like.

369
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,738
Oh, wonderful! Then it's settled.

370
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:26,074
I'll see you at your house
first thing tomorrow.

371
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,743
You're welcome in advance.

372
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,873
That woman seems deranged.

373
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,959
Her face reminds me of a death mask.

374
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,336
Deranged? Death mask?

375
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:42,465
You tell me she's got halitosis,
and I'm hearing wedding bells.

376
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:58,982
Pugsley,
this is the Addams family sabre.

377
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:04,070
Three hundred years of Addams
have danced the mazurka

378
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:05,447
with this blade.

379
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:09,451
Only when you've shown
me you're ready.

380
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:15,331
Your father was the greatest swordsman
in Addams history.

381
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,501
His mazurka was the stuff of legend.

382
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,837
So no pressure!

383
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,841
It's all right here
in the mazurka handbook.

384
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,386
Every Addams performs this rite of passage

385
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,681
to show that you're prepared
to defend your family.

386
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:35,101
It sounds easy, but believe me,
it's insane.

387
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:38,063
Fester, hand him
the goo-goo-ga-ga baby training sword.

388
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:43,318
Pop, has anyone ever failed the mazurka?

389
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,487
Once. Your third cousin, Xander.

390
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,031
- Never heard of him.
- Exactly.

391
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,658
Music!

392
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,077
There's someone at the door.

393
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,121
Hi, guys. I'm going up to
this creepy mansion.

394
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,750
If you don't hear from me in 30 minutes,
send backup.

395
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:14,057
You rang?

396
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,393
Yeah, no. Life's too short. See ya!

397
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,403
Good morning, Kitty.

398
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,572
Greetings, Miss Needler.

399
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,914
Good morning.
I hope this isn't a bad time.

400
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,916
The worst. Do come in.

401
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,042
Glenn?

402
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,339
Welcome to the neighborhood.

403
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,590
Thank you.

404
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,969
Oh, my.

405
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:54,180
Are you... Are you ready
for your Margaux makeover?

406
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:58,393
Quite. Pugsley's been climbing the walls
in anticipation.

407
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,357
Well, well, well.

408
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:06,985
Let's take a look around, shall we?

409
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,571
And before you say anything,
you're welcome.

410
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:13,867
Now, if we're trying
for a more contemporary look,

411
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,411
well, these sconces have to go.

412
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,208
The sconces were a gift
from dead relatives.

413
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:26,254
If we get rid of them, they'll be
terribly hurt the next time they visit.

414
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,675
And this is our whine cellar.

415
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,011
We have a lovely collection of whines.

416
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,180
- Are we there yet?
- I want ice cream!

417
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,473
What do you mean
you're out of avocado toast?

418
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:38,933
This barrel is really bad!

419
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,477
And here's our bottomless pit.

420
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:46,733
- How do we get across?
- One moment.

421
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,373
We call this surfing the web.

422
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,378
Well...

423
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,506
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

424
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,634
Oh, my gosh.

425
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,554
I'm scared to close my eyes.
I'm scared to open them.

426
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:40,954
How do all those people fit
in that little contraption?

427
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:45,250
My vanity mirror
only imprisons 14 souls at a time.

428
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:47,794
You don't have a cell phone?

429
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:49,837
That's weird.

430
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,798
I may not have a cell phone.

431
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:56,261
Well, you don't have a crossbow,
and I thought everybody had one of those.

432
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,516
My name is Wednesday.

433
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,602
Okay. I'm Parker.

434
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,396
How long have you lived here?

435
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,439
My whole life.

436
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:11,025
Which seems endless.

437
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,860
I've never seen you at school.

438
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,196
- I'm cage-schooled.
- Excuse me?

439
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:18,366
It's terribly dull. But my mother insists.

440
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:23,955
I'm actually cutting cage right now.

441
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,209
Okay.

442
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,211
So, what happens at your school?

443
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:33,673
Not much.
Just friends turning on each other.

444
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,342
Girls making other girls
feel bad about themselves.

445
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,636
- Typical junior high stuff.
- Intriguing.

446
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,434
Can anyone go to your school?

447
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,478
I guess so. But who'd want to?

448
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:50,315
Wednesday! Great shot.

449
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:10,626
Mr. and Mrs. Addams,
there's really not much to do

450
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,545
to make this place perfect.

451
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,840
All we have to do is pull down
the side walls,

452
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,968
and then also break down
the other two walls.

453
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:23,723
Open up the ceiling
by breaking it irreversibly.

454
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,934
Just get this nasty
little floor out of the way.

455
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,561
And there you go.

456
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,855
With just those little touches...

457
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,942
Stop right there.
Don't touch another thing.

458
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,819
It's perfect.

459
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,946
Ms. Needler, you have a gift.

460
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,699
The good news is, I can have
a makeover crew up here

461
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,410
and swinging hammers
first thing in the morning.

462
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:45,995
What do you say?

463
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,665
We thought you were finished.
Our whole family is coming in two weeks.

464
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,833
Our finale!

465
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,336
Our finale is in two weeks.

466
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,129
Thank you, Glenn.

467
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:58,508
It's a gracious offer, Ms. Needler,
but you really have done enough.

468
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:01,886
It's our son's mazurka. You understand.

469
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,054
Thank you.

470
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,144
We're missing Mitch. Where's Mitch?

471
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:15,191
Get out!

472
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,068
Mitch who?

473
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,240
Gomez, I'll be blunt.

474
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:25,576
I have 50 houses to sell down there,

475
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:31,207
and their view of your property is,
well, off-brand.

476
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,042
Fifty houses?

477
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:34,210
Yes.

478
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,922
You know, ever since my family
was chased out from the old country,

479
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:42,593
my one dream has been to find a place
we could call home.

480
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,596
Once they see Assimilation...

481
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,516
I think they'll want to stay for good.

482
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,684
What's that?

483
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,354
Thank you so much for coming by, Membrane.

484
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,022
It's Margaux.

485
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:58,359
Well, then... run, Margaux!

486
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,111
Run, run, run!

487
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:09,078
That Wednesday girl is a freak.

488
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:11,914
We're about to be invaded
by a whole army of freaks.

489
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,752
It's tragic when people can't accept
the help they so badly need.

490
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:18,087
And when that happens,

491
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:21,424
well, another kind of intervention
is called for.

492
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,802
I agree, Gomez.

493
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,763
The whole family moving here
would be a dream come true.

494
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:30,349
But I don't trust that Margaux woman.

495
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:33,102
She's an eccentric, darling.
Give her a chance.

496
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:37,482
Raspberry preserves.

497
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:41,319
Must be some kind of
scented embalming fluid.

498
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:47,408
Wednesday, practice your lurking
on someone other than your father.

499
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:48,826
He's too easy.

500
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,163
Much better.

501
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,790
Mother, Father,
I'd like to speak with you.

502
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,460
What's on your mind,
my little night crawler?

503
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,086
I spoke with Parker this afternoon.

504
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:03,049
She's the daughter of
that talking mannequin who came by.

505
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:06,802
She told me about a communal school
all the neighborhood children attend.

506
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,263
It's called junior high.

507
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:12,099
Junior high.

508
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:16,896
Yes. Yes, I have read about those
in my abnormal psychology journals.

509
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,564
Anyone of age can enroll.

510
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:22,193
I think it would be good for me.

511
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:25,238
Well, I think it's a capital idea.

512
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:29,283
What of your studies here?
Your taxidermy is coming along so well.

513
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,869
Mother, would you really deprive me

514
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:35,122
of the opportunity to torment children
my own age?

515
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,166
Ah, she makes a point.

516
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,544
What's more, with Wednesday in school,

517
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,213
we'd get to know the people here
even better.

518
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,423
Well, Mother?

519
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:49,887
- Bye Mom!
- Bye, honey!

520
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:56,477
What?

521
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,481
Have a good day at school, dear.

522
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,943
Do your worst!

523
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,659
Ah, now I understand.

524
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,536
This is a children's prison.

525
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,207
Who's that?

526
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,084
Great.

527
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:22,795
This is Wednesday.

528
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:24,922
Hello.

529
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,091
Hey, Parker.

530
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,177
I got something for you.

531
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:36,017
A moldy sandwich.
You're slipping, Bethany.

532
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,810
You know what? You're right.

533
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,646
- Hey!
- Let's kick it up a notch.

534
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,615
You have no sense of humor.

535
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,118
- Did you see her face?
- I know.

536
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,287
Bethany, is it?

537
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:59,915
Don't cut your eyes on my crew
unless you're ready to dance.

538
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:04,128
What did you say, little ghoul?

539
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,923
I don't think you understand.

540
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:10,968
I'm not locked up in here
with you, Bethany.

541
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:14,680
You're locked up in here with me.

542
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,269
Whatever.

543
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,149
- What did you do?
- You shouldn't have said that.

544
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,611
There's nothing you can do.
Bethany's way too popular.

545
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,488
Popularity is fleeting.

546
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:34,241
I prefer to set my sights on something
a little more challenging.

547
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,701
- Like what?
- Like what?

548
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,828
The establishment.

549
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:59,100
Let's see. Who shall I be today?

550
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,770
How about... Ah, Shelly Longbottom
on Sugar Ridge Lane.

551
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,898
From Shelly Longbottom to everyone.

552
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:11,862
Did you hear about those Addams people?
Question mark.

553
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:16,242
Someone told me they're wanted
in 30 states.

554
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:21,580
You know, they're raising a garden
of man-eating plants.

555
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,165
And feeding them our pets!

556
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,167
Has anyone seen my shih tzu Fifi?

557
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:27,336
They're gonna turn us all into zombies.

558
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,046
Where are they from anyways?

559
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:31,757
It doesn't matter.
It's obvious they don't belong here.

560
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:34,635
Honey? Oh, those awful people
up on the hill...

561
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,762
they're not even on Neighborhood Peeps!

562
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:38,389
Well, that's suspicious.

563
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,807
If other people are scared,
then I'm scared!

564
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,225
I believe everything I read!

565
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,643
I'm not gonna be the last person
on the block to panic.

566
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:44,520
If someone posted it, it must be true.

567
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,605
You invite one family in,
then all the families come in.

568
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,816
Do you think we should investigate?

569
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,443
I'm worried for the children.

570
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:52,653
We need to talk to Margaux!

571
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:59,368
Open your books, page 43.
Follow the instructions.

572
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:03,706
- Yuck.
- Oh, I've done this thousands of times.

573
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,250
I don't want to touch it.

574
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,461
What's that?

575
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,307
Flip the switch.

576
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,621
Give my creature life!

577
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:53,380
Live! Live, I tell you! Live!

578
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:14,401
It's alive! It's alive!

579
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:35,256
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Get them off me!

580
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,520
Bethany's changed her look.
It suits her.

581
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,064
Awesome. Totally awesome.

582
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,525
- It is an honor...
- And a privilege...

583
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,818
to watch you work.

584
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,404
Hey, do you want to go to the mall?

585
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,657
Why not? I haven't seen
a good mauling in ages.

586
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:26,223
It's late. I'm worried.

587
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:30,019
Darling, Wednesday will be fine.
She can take care of herself.

588
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:33,397
It's not Wednesday I'm worried about.
It's the rest of them.

589
00:45:34,024 --> 00:45:35,608
We may need to provide an alibi.

590
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:39,194
My love, it's game night.
Wednesday will be home soon.

591
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:41,322
So why don't you come and join us?

592
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,117
Oh, very well. F-6.

593
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,411
Pugsley, you heard your mother!

594
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,788
Blow F-6!

595
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,791
Fire in the hole!

596
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,668
I'm king of the world!

597
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,641
- Yes!
- You sunk my battleship.

598
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:10,809
Well done, Pugsley.

599
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:21,779
Hello, my uglies!

600
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:25,616
Mother!
I thought I felt my skin crawling.

601
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,704
Grandma, what a surprise.
I thought you were in Prague.

602
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:34,708
I was. They caught me smuggling
crocodiles out of the zoo.

603
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:38,212
But I escaped and talked my way
onto a Somali pirate ship.

604
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,256
We got into a heated poker game,
and I cleaned them out.

605
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,968
- Cheating or robbery?
- Both!

606
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,636
Always remember, Pugsley,

607
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,722
it ain't cheating if no one catches you.

608
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,433
I haven't bathed in two weeks.

609
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,977
Or is it months?

610
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:56,397
That reminds me.
Guess what I've got, Pugsley.

611
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,357
- Candy.
- Oh, yes!

612
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:02,695
But the mazurka isn't for a week.
Why are you here so early?

613
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:05,406
Gomez said you needed a little help
with the party,

614
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,409
and I said I got my son ready
for his mazurka.

615
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:12,079
So of course I'm going to do the same
for my grandson.

616
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,372
I love him.

617
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,374
It's true. I sent for her.

618
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,836
I can't believe you bothered
your mother with that, darling.

619
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:20,462
Neither can I?

620
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:23,215
- He said you were in over your head.
- Thank you, Mother!

621
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,676
He said you were more tense
than he's ever seen you.

622
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,469
I didn't say that exactly.

623
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,888
Yes, you did. You said that exactly.

624
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:33,434
Said he was worried you'd have
a massive facial expression and...

625
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,269
You know, I'm starving. Let's eat.

626
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,147
Not until Wednesday gets home.

627
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,649
Where is that granddaughter of mine?

628
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:42,735
I've got something for her.

629
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:46,613
There's my little storm cloud.

630
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:49,324
Wednesday, where have you been?

631
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:50,409
Elsewhere.

632
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,504
What are you wearing?

633
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:05,090
Parker calls it a pop of color.

634
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:07,801
Well, I certainly appreciate a horse
with a spear through its head.

635
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:10,804
- The color is...
- She claims it brings out my smile.

636
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:13,265
Wednesday, you don't have a smile.

637
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,602
Turns out I have a lot of things
you don't know about.

638
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,066
I see I got here just in time.

639
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,984
You were right to call, Gomez.

640
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,111
I'll talk to her. Hand me that bear trap.

641
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:29,615
Thank you, Grandma.
But I will handle this.

642
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:31,617
Suit yourself.

643
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:37,956
When you're done with Fabio,
send him up to my room.

644
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,084
Oh, boy.

645
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:43,962
Wednesday.

646
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:49,468
How would you like to join me tomorrow
after the... school

647
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,595
for tea and séance in the cemetery?

648
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,347
Is attendance mandatory?

649
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,807
Come, now, my little raven.

650
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:57,226
You did so love it when you were younger.

651
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,894
If you like, Mother.

652
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:02,231
Sleep well, dear.

653
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:05,067
Don't forget to kick your father
good night.

654
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:11,782
What's your favorite filter?

655
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,035
I don't know.
I look black-and-white in all of them.

656
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,080
You know, when I met you,
I thought you were super weird.

657
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:20,124
But now I think you're really cool.

658
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:23,710
I concur. You're not completely
devoid of merit yourself.

659
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,879
I want to say... thank you.

660
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,676
Oh, how'd that barrette you bought
yesterday go over at home?

661
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,139
Actually, my mother's reaction was...
well, unexpected.

662
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:38,600
She was accepting. It depressed me.

663
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,520
One never wants to see
one's mother that way.

664
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,021
But I must admit,

665
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:47,985
walking around in something so garish,
so grotesque,

666
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:50,028
I was shocked how thrilling it felt.

667
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,656
I wish I could do that.

668
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,368
But my mom makes me wear this stuff,
and it's just so... so...

669
00:49:56,452 --> 00:50:00,414
I believe the word you're looking for
is unfortunate.

670
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:06,545
I'd love to just go crazy
and wear something that would shock her.

671
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,215
Well, Parker, you're in luck.

672
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,760
You happen to be talking
to the queen of shock.

673
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:35,782
Hello, Mother.

674
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,910
Where's my little wraith?

675
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,745
Wednesday still hasn't arrived.

676
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:43,040
We agreed to come up here
for tea and séance,

677
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,125
and now it seems she stood me up.

678
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,128
- Morticia, can you hear me?
- You're not doing it right.

679
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,880
- Press that button.
- I did.

680
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,256
- Did you hear it click?
- Morticia!

681
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:53,383
It's supposed to be on
when you hear the click.

682
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:54,718
- Wait, I see something.
- You did it!

683
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:57,763
Hello, darling!
Now, where's my granddaughter?

684
00:50:57,847 --> 00:50:59,223
Just what I said.

685
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,350
I think she's distancing herself from me.

686
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,228
She's wrapped in a black hole
of emptiness and longing

687
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:05,729
like all of us Frump women.

688
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:08,148
- Wednesday...
- It's not Wednesday!

689
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:10,275
- Who's this?
- It's me, Father.

690
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,779
Morticia, what's wrong with you now?

691
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:16,031
The world can be so cruel.

692
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,533
And all she wants to do is run toward it.

693
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:20,118
She's a lot like you that way.

694
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:23,789
You wanted to see the world,
find yourself, serve time.

695
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:25,499
Listen, Morticia.

696
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:29,419
Remember the time you ran away
and joined the Girl Scouts?

697
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,881
We were so worried you were on a bad path.

698
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:37,052
But when you found out that campfires
were for roasting marshmallows

699
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,221
and not other Girl Scouts,

700
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,306
well, you got bored and you came home.

701
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,517
We were so relieved.

702
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,143
Trust Wednesday.

703
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:48,146
Like you, she'll do the right thing.

704
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:51,650
Thank you, Father.
That's most comforting.

705
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:55,028
Good. Wait a second.
When did I die?

706
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:57,281
- Twenty years ago.
- Oh, right.

707
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,658
Happy anniversary, darling.

708
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:02,828
All right, Pugsley.
Let's go through it again.

709
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:05,914
You got this, Pugsley.
This mazurka's nothing.

710
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,627
You eat swords for breakfast.

711
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:13,255
You've just got a case
of pre-ball jitters.

712
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,507
It's way more common than you think.

713
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:18,093
If a mazurka lasts
for more than four hours,

714
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,761
contact your doctor.

715
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,181
From the top. Music.

716
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:40,657
Pugsley, I can honestly say

717
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:44,953
that was most definitely...
a thing you did.

718
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:48,165
Question.
What in heaven's name was it?

719
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:49,499
The Sabre Mazurka.

720
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:54,296
You know what?
You've been practicing hard.

721
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,506
Why don't we call it a day?

722
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:57,924
Hit the showers, kid.

723
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,135
So we're finished?

724
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:04,806
Ah, yes. Yes, son,
we are most certainly finished.

725
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:08,018
Okay.
Thanks, Pop. Thanks, Uncle Fester.

726
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:15,484
This is a complete disaster.

727
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,985
How did this happen?

728
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:19,321
He's going to make a fool of himself
in front of everyone!

729
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,782
Gomez! You gotta calm down!

730
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,076
There's still a day to get him ready.

731
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,621
Fester, a year wouldn't be enough
to get him ready.

732
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,664
I've failed him, Fester.

733
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:31,833
I tried to raise him to be an Addams,

734
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:34,294
but I failed him.

735
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:36,880
They're going to eat him alive.

736
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:40,842
<i>I like it like that</i>

737
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:42,302
<i>Yeah, baby</i>

738
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:44,137
<i>I said I like it like that</i>

739
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:46,556
<i>Oh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh, baby</i>

740
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:48,433
<i>I like it like that</i>

741
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:50,519
All right, thank you.

742
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:53,105
Grandma, we already have a band.

743
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:55,732
They came highly recommended
from the mortuary.

744
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,860
I'm sure they're good.

745
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,655
My sister Sloom is going
to be judging Pugsley.

746
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,532
And if things aren't done
the traditional way,

747
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:07,119
she won't be happy,
and the mazurka could be a disaster.

748
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:08,829
But what do I know?

749
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,081
Fine.

750
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,625
- Hey, we got the gig!
- We got it!

751
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:14,751
One more thing.

752
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:17,587
Oh, someone's at the door.
I'd better go see who it is.

753
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,974
<i>What's so great about being yourself</i>

754
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:33,019
<i>When you can be like everyone else</i>

755
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,439
Do not speak to your mother that way.

756
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:38,233
How dare you enter this house like that.

757
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:41,069
Wait. Where are your tattoos?

758
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,948
Oh, thank the stars.
Where were you?

759
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,533
Hanging out with Parker.

760
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,453
Is this why you skipped
tea and séance?

761
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,455
Your grandparents
were trying to contact you.

762
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:52,706
Holy Hades!

763
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,710
Whoever did that to you, Wednesday,
I hope the other guy looks worse.

764
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,796
Nobody did this to me.
This is my new look.

765
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,090
- Do you like it?
- I do not like it.

766
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:04,176
Everyone knows pink
is a gateway color.

767
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,220
I warned you about sending her
to public school.

768
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:09,848
Don't worry. Wednesday is never going
to that school again.

769
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,183
- What?
- In fact...

770
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,643
she's never leaving this house again.

771
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,900
Wow, that's some evil eye she's got there.

772
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,986
No. That dead-eye stare is new.

773
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,155
And I think I know where she got it.

774
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,699
Hey, guys. This is me now.

775
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,451
If you like it, hit like.

776
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,162
But who cares if you like it?
I'm living my truth.

777
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,122
Parker!

778
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,709
- Who did this to you?
- I did.

779
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:40,337
This is my new look, Mother.

780
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:43,715
I decided that from now on,
I choose my clothes.

781
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:44,799
Not you.

782
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:48,386
This is that little creep
Wednesday Addams's work.

783
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:51,556
She's not a creep.
She's just not like you.

784
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:53,517
Why can't you ever let
people be different?

785
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:56,978
Because it's my calling
to make everyone the same.

786
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,691
Too bright! It burns!

787
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,569
Good. Maybe it'll burn away the weird.

788
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:07,781
I hate it here.
Everything's boring and fake and bright.

789
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,742
Like plastic flowers.
Like... Like you.

790
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:14,204
Parker, plastic flowers live forever.

791
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,624
Now, you go think about that in your room.

792
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,668
With no social media.

793
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:22,254
No! Please, no. Anything but that.

794
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:24,798
Now, go wipe that depressing goop
off your face.

795
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,550
You first.

796
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:30,470
Those Addamses have gone
too far this time.

797
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,932
I think they're going to need
a little more help.

798
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,782
Hey!

799
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,035
Where are you going?

800
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,371
A friend's.

801
00:56:56,455 --> 00:57:00,667
I hold people prisoner,
not the other way around.

802
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,335
Good luck with your mazurka.

803
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,963
Wait! You're leaving?

804
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,965
Who's gonna torment me every day?

805
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,884
Living under this roof
is all the torment you'll need.

806
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,262
Besides, our parents have made it clear

807
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,098
that the only way to be accepted
in this family

808
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:18,184
is to be exactly like them.

809
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,437
I can't play by those rules anymore.

810
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,439
Farewell, brother Pugsley.

811
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,858
Tomorrow you become a man.

812
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:27,485
And I become a fugitive.

813
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,990
Always kind of knew it'd end up like this.

814
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,117
Just didn't think it'd be so soon.

815
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,870
I'll never forget you, Pugsley.

816
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,330
But I'll try.

817
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,583
Pugsley, have you seen your sister?

818
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,627
She's not in her room.

819
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,505
Pugsley, where's Wednesday?

820
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:55,430
Ticktock. Ticktock, Mother.

821
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:58,224
You're getting very sleepy.

822
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:59,768
Pugsley.

823
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:03,313
She did not go to her friend's house.

824
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,106
She went to her friend's house?

825
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:09,069
I repeat,
she did not go to her friend's...

826
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:39,224
<i>When the day is long</i>

827
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,352
<i>And the night</i>

828
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:47,857
<i>The night is yours alone</i>

829
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:55,573
<i>When you're sure you've had enough</i>

830
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,661
<i>Of this life</i>

831
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:03,123
<i>Hang on</i>

832
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:11,214
<i>Don't let yourself go</i>

833
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:18,763
<i>'Cause everybody cries</i>

834
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:26,229
<i>And everybody hurts</i>

835
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,816
<i>Sometimes</i>

836
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,277
I shall be staying with you for a while.

837
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:35,280
<i>Everybody</i>

838
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:40,827
<i>Hurts</i>

839
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,581
If this doesn't work, the next house
we flip is gonna land on you.

840
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:45,832
Marty, listen to me.

841
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,293
Tomorrow, our finale will be
the biggest half-hour

842
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:50,211
your network has ever aired.

843
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:52,338
There's just one more thing
to take care of.

844
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:55,008
This better be good, or you won't be able
to get a job as a doormat!

845
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:59,554
Yes, yes, yes.
I intend to bring the house down.

846
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:44,015
You rang?

847
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,518
It! Cousin! You made it!

848
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:50,146
Please come in. Make yourself at home.

849
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,234
Where did she hide my phone?

850
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,112
I haven't been able to post a photo
of my lunch in almost three days.

851
01:00:58,197 --> 01:00:59,781
And what about in there?

852
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:04,577
That's my mom's crafting room.
No one is allowed in there.

853
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,371
Then that's where it is.

854
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:15,088
Weird.

855
01:01:28,853 --> 01:01:31,187
Hidden depths.

856
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,522
What is this?

857
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:35,984
There's Mr. Haney making a sandwich.

858
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:39,195
And that guy trying to put
a tiny tuxedo on his cat.

859
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,864
- That's Mr. Flynn.
- Why are you being so difficult?

860
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:43,825
My money's on the cat.

861
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:46,703
And there's our science teacher,
Ms. Gravely...

862
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:49,455
putting her underwear in the freezer?

863
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,752
My mom must've built hidden cameras
into all of the houses.

864
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:56,129
She really is psycho.

865
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,338
Parker!

866
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:00,550
Hey, Mom.

867
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,927
We were just looking for you.

868
01:02:03,012 --> 01:02:06,556
What have I told you
about Mommy's crafting room?

869
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,811
Sorry to do this,
but standards must be upheld.

870
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:14,355
Parker, someday you'll understand.
And, Wednesday...

871
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:16,357
Well, anyway, Parker.

872
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,989
My mom has a lair and a jail?

873
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,450
I knew I should've picked
to live with my dad.

874
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:27,493
We're gonna be on TV!

875
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:29,037
Are we gonna be famous?

876
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:30,496
Glenn,
what do you want in the frame?

877
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:32,081
Okay, everyone, listen up.

878
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:34,500
It's the last run-through
before the finale,

879
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:36,878
so let's try this one last time, okay?

880
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,297
We're gonna shoot across the town square
to the gazebo,

881
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,132
where Margaux will make
her grand entrance.

882
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:45,178
So everyone will be walking
this direction across the square.

883
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:48,848
Judy, you start here.
Ken, you're gonna follow Judy.

884
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,475
You can stand right here and...

885
01:02:51,936 --> 01:02:53,853
Is there a bathroom nearby?

886
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,027
Margaux, they're here!

887
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,528
What are you talking about?

888
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:03,988
They're here!

889
01:03:04,073 --> 01:03:06,240
The Addams family!

890
01:03:16,585 --> 01:03:18,169
Pardon me.

891
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:20,338
Excuse me.

892
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:22,131
What are we gonna do?

893
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:25,051
What we always do, Glenn.

894
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,761
Help people.

895
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,097
The Addams monsters

896
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:33,685
are planning to attack
the town tonight!

897
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,478
Exclamation point.

898
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,522
Meet at Margaux's house now.

899
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:48,449
Salutations, Addams! We're here!

900
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:51,786
Petunia, I love what you've done
with your hair.

901
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,205
Thanks. I just had it mowed.

902
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,833
Please come in.
Make yourself uncomfortable.

903
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,418
Uncle Onion!

904
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:00,503
It's been so long!

905
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,714
Yes. So disappointed to see you.

906
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,092
You always manage
to bring a tear to my eye.

907
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,887
Greetings, Dr. Flambé.
How are you doing?

908
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:12,098
- I'm on fire.
- Good!

909
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,808
This party's gonna be lit.

910
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,727
Auntie Sloom.

911
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,646
Auntie Sloom.

912
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:23,484
You are as radiant
as a barrel of nuclear waste.

913
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:26,779
Where is the boy?

914
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:27,864
Pugsley!

915
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:29,615
There you are.

916
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,535
Come down and say hello
to your Auntie Sloom.

917
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:39,500
Gomez, this tradition
is not to be taken lightly.

918
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,962
I trust that the boy
has been properly trained.

919
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:44,547
Yes, once you see how...

920
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:48,760
It's bad enough this mazurka
is taking place in New Jersey.

921
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:52,263
Now, where are the drinks?
I'm thirsty.

922
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,307
You've seen them!

923
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,060
You've heard the stories
on Neighborhood Peeps.

924
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:02,023
Those Addams aren't people.
They're monsters.

925
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:05,234
And now there's an infestation of them.

926
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:08,529
They're here to destroy
our beautiful community

927
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:12,200
and turn into a place that
no design intervention can save.

928
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:14,660
Addams aren't wanted here!

929
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,537
They're monsters!
They're all monsters!

930
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:19,665
We need to destroy them first!

931
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,834
Who's with me?

932
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:23,795
We'll be revealing Assimilation

933
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:26,089
and all of you to our audience
in just an hour.

934
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:29,509
Our last chance
to help these people is now.

935
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:32,929
Bill, John, do you still have
that lovely catapult?

936
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:34,305
- Yes, we do!
- Yes, we do!

937
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,015
Are you sure about this?

938
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:38,476
We can't let them
ruin our neighborhood!

939
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,104
- Let's do it!
- I want them out!

940
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:45,399
No one torments my family but me.

941
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:47,151
Hair clip, please.

942
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:49,112
Okay.

943
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,790
- Wha...
- Cage school 101.

944
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,752
He'd better be ready,
or Auntie Sloom will have his head.

945
01:06:04,837 --> 01:06:06,129
He looks very small.

946
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:07,964
The kid's got some big shoes to fill.

947
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:09,882
I certainly hope the boy is ready.

948
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,843
I'm not going easy on him.

949
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:23,312
Heads up!

950
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:26,566
Hey, alto. You're flat.

951
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:33,698
Sloom.

952
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:34,991
Sister.

953
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,869
Darling, I know the last time
we saw each other,

954
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:39,370
we had that horrible fight.

955
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:42,498
And I just wanted to tell you,
from the bottom of my heart,

956
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,751
I won that fight,
and I was glad I cheated!

957
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:47,044
You won?

958
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:49,797
Still a sore loser, as always!

959
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:52,592
I want a rematch,
right here, right now.

960
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:55,094
Auntie Sloom, can I get you anything?

961
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:56,470
When's the mazurka?

962
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:59,891
Soon, soon.
Our daughter Wednesday isn't here yet.

963
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:02,685
If your daughter can't be on time,

964
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,021
then we will begin without her!

965
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:07,899
Very well, Auntie Sloom.

966
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:14,697
Attention, please. Attention!

967
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:20,494
The hour is upon us.

968
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:21,579
Places!

969
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:40,973
We gather today to witness my son,
Pugsley Addams,

970
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:43,684
perform his Sabre Mazurka.

971
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:10,002
He will begin with a reading
from The Terror,

972
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:13,923
which commemorates our cries in battle.

973
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:39,573
And now the transition into manhood.

974
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,344
And now the Sabre Mazurka.

975
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,770
Hold still.

976
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:15,776
The Addams mustache.
Now you're ready.

977
01:10:26,348 --> 01:10:27,390
Pugsley.

978
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:32,895
I give up. I can't do it, Pop.

979
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,902
I'm sorry.

980
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,154
I let you down.

981
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:45,533
You haven't let me down, Pugsley.

982
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,911
I let you down.

983
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:52,248
I was so focused on doing things
the traditional way,

984
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:54,500
I forgot to let you be who you are.

985
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:03,592
Hey! Are you ready
for your Margaux makeover now?

986
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:05,010
It's Margaux.

987
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:08,013
She must've turned the whole town
into stark raving lunatics.

988
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,558
Well, I have to admit I admire her work.

989
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:13,394
- Let's do this then!
- It's locked and loaded, Margaux!

990
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:15,312
Let's go get 'em!

991
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:17,523
Fire!

992
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:26,574
Get out!

993
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:37,251
Pugsley! What is the true meaning
of the mazurka?

994
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:41,589
It's about protecting our family
from those who would do us harm.

995
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:45,384
Go ahead.
Show them what you're good at.

996
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:54,435
All we have to do
is pull down the side walls!

997
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:08,157
Everyone, follow my boy!

998
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,455
Hey, guys?

999
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:50,699
Fire!

1000
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,412
Shakalaka bang, baby!

1001
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,505
Quick, out this way!

1002
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:11,053
Pop, I'm out of ammo!

1003
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:14,223
We're trapped!

1004
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:38,289
Hope I'm not crashing the party.

1005
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:39,415
Wednesday!

1006
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,708
Yes!

1007
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:42,626
Ichabod, quick! Lower your branches!

1008
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,755
Everyone grab on!

1009
01:14:10,322 --> 01:14:15,284
Margaux Needler never stops
until the project is complete!

1010
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:20,164
Fire in the hole!

1011
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:22,750
Mazurka!

1012
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:28,088
Is everyone all right?

1013
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:30,924
No limbs missing that weren't missing
before you arrived?

1014
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,432
My little raven.

1015
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,268
I'm so happy you returned.

1016
01:14:41,353 --> 01:14:42,728
Of course I came back.

1017
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,356
I knew there was no way
you were going to save yourselves.

1018
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,691
You were like weak baby squirrels.

1019
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:52,946
It's so good to see you.

1020
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:54,907
And you.

1021
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:01,955
Socrates.

1022
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:06,752
Eight legs. Nine lives.

1023
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:11,298
You were right, cara mia.

1024
01:15:12,384 --> 01:15:13,842
People can be cruel.

1025
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,053
What have we done?

1026
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:18,806
They're just a family.

1027
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:22,017
A family? Please!
They're a bunch of monsters.

1028
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:24,353
Don't go soft on me, people.

1029
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:26,480
I will relish hounding you

1030
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,774
until that nuclear waste dump
of a house is gone

1031
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,694
and your mutant family along with it.

1032
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:34,196
Be careful what you wish for,
Miss Needler.

1033
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:38,701
My family and I will never run
from the likes of you again.

1034
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,250
Deep breath, Margaux.

1035
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:48,001
Okay, I have a finale to shoot.

1036
01:15:48,086 --> 01:15:49,503
Parker, let's go.

1037
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,380
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1038
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:53,173
I'm staying with my friend.

1039
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:56,468
Your friend?
Parker, these people are freaks.

1040
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:58,429
If they're freaks, then I'm a freak.

1041
01:15:58,513 --> 01:16:00,514
And so are all of you.

1042
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:05,185
Exhibit A, Ms. Gravely.
You put your underwear in the freezer.

1043
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,271
Hey, it's refreshing, okay?

1044
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:11,692
Exhibit B, Trudy Pickering.
You sit on the toilet backwards.

1045
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:14,236
Well, where else am I supposed
to put my arms?

1046
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,405
Wait. How did you know that?

1047
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:20,659
Because your houses have been infested
with Needler-Vision.

1048
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:23,120
She has hidden cameras everywhere.

1049
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:26,874
- What?
- And watches you all of the time.

1050
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:29,960
- In my private time?
- What else has she seen?

1051
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,712
That is over the line.

1052
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:34,298
Shut up! Listen, you lemmings.

1053
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:36,133
This is my town.

1054
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:39,011
You are nothing but a bunch of extras.

1055
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:42,723
We are going to march down that hill
and do a live show.

1056
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:46,769
I expect you to convince those
brainless peons out there in the audience

1057
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:49,354
that this is the perfect place
to buy a house,

1058
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:51,940
or none of you will be
living here much longer.

1059
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:53,692
- Do you hear me?
- Actually, Mom...

1060
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:55,402
everyone can hear you.

1061
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:57,613
You've been live this whole time.

1062
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:01,074
Three million people
are watching you right now.

1063
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:02,951
The real you, for a change.

1064
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:06,121
Please. What do I care
what a bunch of bloggers think?

1065
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:07,581
- Margaux?
- What?

1066
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:11,460
It's the network.
They're taking your show off the air.

1067
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:15,088
What? No. I'll be bankrupt.

1068
01:17:15,173 --> 01:17:16,632
Who will buy all these houses?

1069
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:19,218
Okay, watch this. Now's my chance.

1070
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:23,347
Excuse me.
I just tooted.

1071
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:26,683
Furthermore, I think I can help you
get rid of those houses.

1072
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:27,976
What are you talking about?

1073
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:31,647
Well, my dear, you've got a bunch
of houses you need to get rid of

1074
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:34,525
and I got a bunch of family
I need to get rid of.

1075
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:36,151
Hello?

1076
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:38,695
Excuse me. I'm Trudy.

1077
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:43,367
Trudy Pickering.
We never officially met.

1078
01:17:43,451 --> 01:17:45,744
Ah, yes. The toilet woman.

1079
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:46,954
Right.

1080
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:52,000
Listen. Please give us a chance
to make it right.

1081
01:17:52,085 --> 01:17:55,629
Let us have our own design intervention.

1082
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,133
Mother, I spent time with these people.

1083
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:04,179
And it is true, they are odd.

1084
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:07,766
But we shouldn't judge them
just because they're different.

1085
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,915
Have a wonderful day.

1086
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:34,293
Thanks! Bye!

1087
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,587
Have a good day!

1088
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,800
Well, hello there.

1089
01:18:41,885 --> 01:18:44,595
Howdy, neighbor. How's the new house?

1090
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:48,307
I love it. I hope you brought
your umbrellas.

1091
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:52,019
You put in a typhoon. What a great idea.

1092
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:54,062
Don't forget the gift basket, silly.

1093
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:57,858
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We got scented embalming fluid,

1094
01:18:57,942 --> 01:19:00,611
toes, teeth, a fruitcake,

1095
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:03,572
rat bait, got some dried apricots.

1096
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:07,576
He's like training a puppy.
Adorable but tiresome.

1097
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,536
She's the woman of my dreams!

1098
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:12,080
Her breath is like a baby's diaper.

1099
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:14,541
Fester, stop.

1100
01:19:14,626 --> 01:19:18,170
Who would've thought a guy like me,
a total zero,

1101
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,298
would've ended up with you, an also zero?

1102
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:22,966
Well, do come in.

1103
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:29,431
Now with the house rebuilt,
Pugsley,

1104
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:33,727
we can throw you the celebration
you deserve.

1105
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,398
You are Addams, through and through.

1106
01:19:56,459 --> 01:20:00,504
Get out!

1107
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:03,840
Oh, how lovely. The spirit's home.

1108
01:20:04,384 --> 01:20:06,677
Finally back to normal.

1109
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:14,518
We did good.

1110
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:16,395
I won't tell anyone if you don't.

1111
01:20:17,305 --> 01:21:17,710
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
