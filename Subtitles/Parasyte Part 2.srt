1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,228
<i>What's the point of our existence?</i>

3
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,564
<i>What are we even doing here?</i>

4
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:18,149
<i>Human life is precious.</i>

5
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:19,859
<i>What's precious is one's own life.</i>

6
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:23,696
<i>You only got into his arm...fascinating.</i>

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,157
Attack this human and I'll kill you.

8
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:31,412
<i>It's vital that we make a network.</i>

9
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:33,831
I researched that "devil" concept.

10
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:37,251
You humans are the closest life form to it.

11
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:42,423
<i>- Mum, is it you?
- It's Mr A!</i>

12
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,593
Tell me it's not true!

13
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,012
Shinichi!

14
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:58,022
<i>You two are blending on a cellular level...</i>

15
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:00,649
<i>I'm turning into one of you?</i>

16
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:03,444
<i>You are Shinichi Izumi, right?</i>

17
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:15,247
<i>There's no way we can coexist.</i>

18
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,294
<i>No human moves like that.
What's happening?</i>

19
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:28,010
<i>Motherhood is a mysterious thing.</i>

20
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:33,057
The tears won't come.

21
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:39,605
Devour their entire species.

22
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:36,704
We're grateful for your help.

23
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:39,707
He won't be any use to you.

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,545
We've got reason to believe
he'll be a good tool.

25
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,896
<i>Send the first one in.</i>

26
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:14,408
A person of interest in the parasite murders.

27
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,538
Uragami, what do you think?

28
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:21,874
Reckon he's human?

29
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,419
Of course he is.

30
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:29,381
And not one of your monsters?

31
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,218
He's obviously human.

32
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:35,387
Next.

33
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:48,567
Next.

34
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:54,031
That's the kind I like.

35
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,034
Next.

36
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:03,040
Don't bring me old ladies, for hell's sake.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,587
You're wasting your time on this nutcase.

38
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:16,387
I reckon you're the crazy ones.

39
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:22,393
Can't even recognise your fellow men.

40
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,604
Keep running, honey. I'll get you!

41
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,898
<i>The reason I became special</i>

42
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:32,611
<i>is because I got to toy around
with all sorts of people.</i>

43
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:37,908
Calm down...

44
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:11,191
<i>It was a surprise when I first saw one.</i>

45
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:15,029
<i>Dressed like a human,
looking as sweet as a puppy.</i>

46
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:23,871
<i>Alien or not,
I was anticipating some fun...</i>

47
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,670
<i>But it was no big deal.</i>

48
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:34,840
<i>He just did the same as me.</i>

49
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:40,471
In any case,

50
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:46,477
even wild animals have the ability
to distinguish their own kind.

51
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,909
Have him look straight forward.

52
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:05,913
Tell him.

53
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,248
<i>Please look forward.</i>

54
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:23,222
Nah...

55
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,058
I'm mistaken...

56
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:30,771
Something bothered you?

57
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:36,276
Thought I saw a flash
of something else in his eyes.

58
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:39,446
I imagined it.

59
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:59,633
PARASYTE PART 2

60
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:08,976
Someone is hunting down these parasites.

61
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:16,483
Most of the dead ones have turned up

62
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:21,113
not far from Shinichi Izumi's place.

63
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:24,241
Shinichi, I'm detecting
brain-waves...close by.

64
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:25,367
What direction?

65
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:27,786
Hard left, about 70 meters.

66
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:34,501
One of them happened to be

67
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,670
his own mother.

68
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:43,510
What's more, the school
he happens to attend

69
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:48,849
was where Hideo Shimada
carried out that massacre.

70
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:54,188
He was then killed by persons unknown.

71
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:56,523
Is that just a coincidence?

72
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,526
Mr Hirama, sir...

73
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:03,697
Isn't this way over our heads?

74
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:04,341
You're one of us?

75
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,011
No, you're human.

76
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:10,847
I get it...

77
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:12,933
I know you...

78
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,102
Migi, get ready to fight.

79
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:16,687
Wait!

80
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,409
Amazing.

81
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:43,630
If only I'd got here sooner.

82
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:48,468
What's wrong?

83
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:16,163
I'm certain someone's tailing me.

84
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:18,332
Don't you feel anything?

85
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:21,501
Sensing human presence isn't my speciality.

86
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:25,839
Cops would've arrested me ages ago.

87
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:31,011
In any case, it's not good.
Stop this senseless behaviour.

88
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:35,557
Killing my kind won't bring back
your mum or your friends.

89
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:37,517
You just put us in danger.

90
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:40,687
Sympathising with fellow aliens?

91
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:43,315
Just concerned for our safety.

92
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:47,527
Every kill reduces the toll of human lives.

93
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:49,655
You're pissing in the wind.

94
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:54,493
When I've honed my technique,
I'll go kill the boss.

95
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:56,662
The boss?

96
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:02,542
Having a monster as mayor is beyond a joke.

97
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:06,713
Taking over City Hall, controlling our town.
I'll kill them all.

98
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:07,839
Newsletter
Higashi Fukuyama

99
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:12,219
This is human humour, right?

100
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:16,223
Let's have a taste.

101
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,684
Am I right?

102
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,228
Shinichi?

103
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,233
It's delicious.

104
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:29,236
Your miso soup is really very good.

105
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:32,906
You know City Hall is
a fortress of them now?

106
00:11:37,703 --> 00:11:40,831
Higashi Fukuyama City Hall

107
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,298
Another incident?

108
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:52,342
Another one of us was killed.

109
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,760
Where?

110
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:56,096
In the E block eating area.

111
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,599
How long do we tolerate this?
That human must die.

112
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,270
Ms Tamiya, what's your opinion?

113
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:08,942
Shinichi Izumi's mother was killed.

114
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:11,278
And his girlfriend almost died, too.

115
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:14,448
He's venting his anger in random violence.

116
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:19,453
It's a temporary phenomenon.
Let it pass.

117
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,956
You prefer to side with a human?

118
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:27,794
We should leave them for observation.

119
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:31,298
It holds greater merit for our kind.

120
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:38,472
If our aim is coexistence with humanity,

121
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:40,974
they remain our greatest hope.

122
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:43,810
Hope, huh?

123
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:48,315
I'd like to hear Mr Goto on this.
Where is he?

124
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,321
Still training, I should think.

125
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:57,491
We don't need to hear his opinion.

126
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:12,339
Be quiet.

127
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:26,186
In this country, 30,000 people a year
commit suicide and 80,000 disappear.

128
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:30,857
If we plan our predation systematically,
it'll calm down

129
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:33,527
and we can live in harmony.

130
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:37,030
In fact, it's already happening.

131
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:41,201
I get it. I agree.

132
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:46,706
After all, it's thanks to Ms Tamiya
that our colony thrives.

133
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,768
Mizoguchi Sogyo

134
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:19,072
What the hell's your problem?

135
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:24,911
This is a yakuza office, right?
How many are you?

136
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:29,416
None of your damn business!

137
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:28,975
You play well, Goto.

138
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,774
The piano is good training.

139
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:40,612
Eight dead at a yakuza hangout.
Overdoing it, perhaps?

140
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:44,783
It wasn't me. it was Miki's doing.

141
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:46,451
Miki, huh?

142
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,121
In search of your approval, no doubt.

143
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:54,292
He sustained three stab wounds.

144
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,131
Admittedly his opponents weren't amateurs,

145
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:02,968
but it's a poor performance.

146
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:08,807
Tell him his human expressions
are unnatural.

147
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:12,644
By the way, Goto...

148
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:19,818
Some say Migi and Shinichi should be killed.

149
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:21,987
Kill them, then.

150
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,992
Ms Tamiya won't allow it.
She wants them under observation.

151
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:30,495
She thinks they're our main hope.

152
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,415
Our hope, huh?

153
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:37,127
How is she observing them?

154
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:42,007
Any approach would be detected, right?

155
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,677
She's employing a human, apparently.

156
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:51,016
Manipulating human emotions
to control the situation.

157
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:08,199
Waited long?

158
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,702
Not at all.

159
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,168
Ms Tamiya...

160
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:21,504
I really think we should go public.

161
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:25,508
You mean sell to the mass media?

162
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:30,180
I know how you must feel.

163
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:34,184
You don't want to hurt a former pupil.

164
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:41,191
But the public should know the truth
about these parasites.

165
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:45,361
The government is concealing information.

166
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:51,034
I'm no elite journalist
but I can't remain silent.

167
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:57,791
I'm sorry to say this,

168
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,627
but surely you could use the money?

169
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,133
Life's hard as a single parent.

170
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:11,137
As a widower, I know this too well.

171
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:17,936
I'm not trying to use you.

172
00:18:18,228 --> 00:18:19,938
On the contrary...

173
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:23,775
I want us to share the experience.

174
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,612
Ryoko, I...

175
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:29,948
Since we both lost our spouses...

176
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:31,157
Mr Kuramori.

177
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:32,325
Yes.

178
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:37,288
Please wait a little longer.

179
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:41,626
Let me think it over.

180
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,427
What we share is very important to me.

181
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:56,641
Certainly...

182
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:04,983
Peek-a-boo!

183
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:34,512
I'm home.

184
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,018
Yumi?

185
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:43,354
You ate already?

186
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:01,039
Would you like a new mum?

187
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:06,377
Of course it has to be someone you like...

188
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:10,882
Don't talk nonsense.
Nobody would want you anyway.

189
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:13,384
Maybe my luck's changing.

190
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:17,222
Stop acting weird. Calm down.

191
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:20,642
You're no fun...

192
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,234
Entry Forbidden

193
00:21:14,028 --> 00:21:17,407
Everyone's back to normal
as if nothing happened.

194
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:23,746
All those grown-ups

195
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:27,583
telling me to forget everything,

196
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:30,920
to keep it to myself.

197
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:35,258
Isn't that odd?

198
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:40,596
But...

199
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:46,269
- Forgetting is important
- How could I?

200
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:49,439
Shinichi, are you mad?

201
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:52,942
Maybe you knew all along, about Shimada.

202
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,945
About all of this.

203
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:29,395
Shinichi...

204
00:22:30,063 --> 00:22:31,564
You noticed him, too?

205
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:56,589
What do you want?

206
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:01,594
What do you mean?

207
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:06,265
- Kill him.
- Stop.

208
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,436
He knows our secret. He must die.

209
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:11,771
He's human.

210
00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:13,606
You kill us without a thought.

211
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:14,941
We can't kill a human.

212
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:17,902
Please, don't. I've got a daughter...

213
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:25,118
Show us your footage.

214
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:35,128
You've shot loads of stuff.

215
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:37,630
I don't look good on camera.

216
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:39,132
No one cares.

217
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:42,635
Delete it all.

218
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:46,139
It should go public.

219
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:52,478
For the sake of society
you should surrender yourself for research.

220
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:54,730
That's the last straw.

221
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:58,860
Wait. It's my job to spread the truth.

222
00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:00,278
You just need money.

223
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:06,159
Izumi, if you hate the parasites,

224
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:10,163
cooperate with the authorities
and trust the police.

225
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:17,170
The thing that killed my mother
was a police officer.

226
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:21,340
Mr Kuramori.

227
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:25,511
How do you even know about us?

228
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:31,184
Well, a woman came to me for advice,

229
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:34,854
worried that a pupil might be a parasite.

230
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:36,189
A Pupil?

231
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:37,690
Ryoko Tamiya?

232
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,364
She's played you like a harp, Mr Kuramori.

233
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,950
Played me? She's not like that...

234
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:50,036
Ryoko Tamiya just happens to be

235
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:52,538
the smartest parasite out there.

236
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:57,543
Her, a parasite?

237
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:01,881
No way.

238
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:30,409
It's been a while. You've grown strong.

239
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:34,747
Come on up, I'll make coffee.

240
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,083
Stop pretending to be human.

241
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:41,254
You're actually raising a human child...

242
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,425
An experiment to understand motherhood.

243
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:49,929
How dare you even use that word...

244
00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:54,433
A savage monster freak
could never be worthy.

245
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,437
You should worry about yourselves.

246
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,108
My colleagues are eager to kill you.

247
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,277
The mayor and his gang?

248
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:07,280
They still want human flesh.

249
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:13,452
But gradually I'll train them
to take other food.

250
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:16,455
Give me a little time.

251
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:20,126
So I turn a blind eye while people die?

252
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:30,970
Trust me.

253
00:26:31,596 --> 00:26:35,975
Then I'll be able to ensure your safety.

254
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:39,312
I'll never trust what a monster says.

255
00:26:40,104 --> 00:26:43,482
Can human words be trusted?

256
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:46,986
She's got a point.

257
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:49,739
Shut up.

258
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:17,475
Got the picture now?

259
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:22,980
She's the leader,
organising all the parasites in this area.

260
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:26,317
City Hall is their stronghold.

261
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:28,653
Don't get involved.

262
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,823
Forget everything you know
and get out of here.

263
00:27:38,454 --> 00:27:41,499
The second you're no use, she'll kill you.

264
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,170
You've been warned.

265
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,006
So leave us alone.

266
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:00,184
Goddamn it...

267
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,520
How dare she?

268
00:28:02,978 --> 00:28:05,356
Goddamn it...

269
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:16,534
She thought I'd just roll over?

270
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,373
Higashi Fukuyama City Hall

271
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:28,212
Yes, we're actively attracting
new industry to the area,

272
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:35,386
but development only happens alongside
historical and environmental protection.

273
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:43,060
OK, I've got that.

274
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:46,731
Thank you for granting
a last minute request.

275
00:28:47,148 --> 00:28:49,400
I'll send you my article when it's done.

276
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:01,078
Thank you.

277
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,934
It's a bug he planted earlier.

278
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:29,607
Kill him.

279
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,443
You're sure?

280
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:35,946
And the one with the arm, while we're at it.

281
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:38,949
What do we tell Ryoko Tamiya?

282
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:44,288
No need to tell her.

283
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:10,815
Sorry for the horrid things
I said the other day.

284
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:13,651
I know you saved me.

285
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,448
You're experiencing a lot worse,

286
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,785
with your mum and all...

287
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,455
Forget it. No need to worry about me.

288
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:33,128
You're pretty tough
considering you were always such a chicken.

289
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:36,131
Sun dragging that up?

290
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,136
I can't cry any more.

291
00:30:42,263 --> 00:30:43,305
The tears...

292
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:47,977
They won't come.

293
00:30:51,438 --> 00:30:54,316
I'm losing the human side of my emotions.

294
00:30:57,778 --> 00:30:59,989
You'll always be Shinichi.

295
00:31:02,783 --> 00:31:04,326
I know that.

296
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:12,001
Shinichi, enemy in range.

297
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:18,340
I've got to be somewhere. See you.

298
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,634
Shinichi...

299
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:26,599
Get this straight,
you're short by a couple of zeroes.

300
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:29,268
I risk my life for this stuff.

301
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:34,106
I'll shop it to the other TV stations.
Think it over.

302
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,609
I'll be in touch.

303
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:39,111
What's up, Dad?

304
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,780
You're acting all tough.

305
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:48,454
If there's anything you want
let me buy it for you.

306
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:50,956
I bagged a once-in-a-lifetime scoop.

307
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:56,629
Don't over-do it, Dad.
You're one of the little guys.

308
00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:58,631
Remember who you are.

309
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:00,799
You sure piss me off.

310
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:03,969
But if you insist and it goes well,

311
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:06,472
you can buy a new version of this.

312
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:09,141
You're so patronising.

313
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:11,977
I'll go get some cigarettes.

314
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:14,647
Get toilet paper while you're at it.

315
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:18,817
She's getting like her mother.

316
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:21,904
Where is it?

317
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:24,990
They're following close.
Tailing by 300 meters.

318
00:32:25,157 --> 00:32:26,200
It's not Tamiya?

319
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:29,328
No. And I sense incredible bloodlust.

320
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:31,163
They're out to kill us.

321
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,706
Do we go on the offensive?

322
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:34,458
There are five of them.

323
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,085
Five?

324
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,674
What about that promise of safety, Tamiya?

325
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:43,676
They're on our tail.

326
00:32:51,392 --> 00:32:54,186
It's no use hiding.
Brain-waves give us both away.

327
00:32:54,353 --> 00:32:56,855
- We have to fight.
- It's five against one.

328
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:07,533
That's just one guy.

329
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:08,909
That can't be right.

330
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,369
He's clearly alone.

331
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:19,461
Ah, there you are.

332
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,716
You're pretty fast, kid.

333
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:25,050
What's going on?

334
00:33:25,718 --> 00:33:27,386
This guy has five of them.

335
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:32,725
Head, both arms and both legs
are parasites...

336
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:35,060
One body with five parasites...

337
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:38,063
Bingo...

338
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:41,692
This is crazy!

339
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:58,917
Daiso

340
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:28,632
You're agile, too.

341
00:35:30,217 --> 00:35:31,510
Our odds aren't good.

342
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:33,470
Don't despair just yet.

343
00:35:34,054 --> 00:35:36,473
His moves are sloppy and inaccurate.

344
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:41,145
Give up, kid.

345
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,901
What?

346
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:51,989
His limbs get in each other's way.
There's the key.

347
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:53,157
Key to what?

348
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:55,492
We'll use our speed. Let's go Shinichi!

349
00:35:57,536 --> 00:35:59,329
Time to wrap this up!

350
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:00,497
Here we go!

351
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:15,554
We did it!

352
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:20,851
The head's supposed to control
but it couldn't handle it.

353
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,480
Coordinating four parasites is no easy task.

354
00:36:25,772 --> 00:36:27,691
Let's stab him in the heart.

355
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,362
This isn't good.

356
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:24,456
Miki, come on back.

357
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,638
The right arm's your best position after all.

358
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:44,977
We shouldn't go home tonight.

359
00:37:45,102 --> 00:37:48,605
The entire organisation
is on the lookout for us.

360
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,816
Life on the run, huh?

361
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:53,402
Make your bed and lie in it.

362
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:16,675
Hirokawa...

363
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:20,512
Don't forget who got you elected.

364
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:23,849
I'm aware it was you.

365
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:28,854
Then why do you act
without my permission?

366
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,525
Ms Tamiya.

367
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:37,863
We must eliminate
any threat to our organisation.

368
00:38:38,697 --> 00:38:39,698
He's right.

369
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:43,869
Take Shinichi, Migi or that journalist...

370
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:47,205
Your so-called "experiments"
are the problem.

371
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:49,541
The problem is your failure
to eliminate them!

372
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,378
Specifically...

373
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:59,217
Letting the journalist escape
and only killing his child.

374
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:01,887
I despair at your ineptitude.

375
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,557
It's important to remove all trace of him.

376
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:09,561
A single human is an easy target.

377
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:14,900
You totally fail to grasp
their essential nature.

378
00:39:16,568 --> 00:39:18,070
The key human trait

379
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:22,240
is to care for another
more than for themselves.

380
00:39:23,075 --> 00:39:26,745
When robbed of that person,
their anger and hatred

381
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:30,582
drives them to the point of insanity.

382
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:33,418
Don't you remember anything?

383
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:36,088
<i>It'll already have happened...</i>

384
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,593
<i>That journalist's very being
will be fundamentally transformed.</i>

385
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:46,765
Did you stumble across
some incredible secret?

386
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:50,268
Mr Kuramori, give us something.

387
00:39:53,688 --> 00:39:56,608
<i>But humans are feeble creatures.</i>

388
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:59,611
Judged on an individual basis, yes.

389
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:02,447
But you're incorrect.

390
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:07,452
The fact you must grasp is that

391
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:10,288
when humans gather

392
00:40:10,914 --> 00:40:17,462
in their tens, hundreds,
thousands, tens of thousands,

393
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:21,133
they become a distinct organism,

394
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:26,471
part of another human intelligence,

395
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,808
a vast, collective brain.

396
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:30,934
Fire!

397
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,323
The moment we defy that,

398
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,327
we will be defeated.

399
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:56,001
You must never again behave so rashly!

400
00:40:57,252 --> 00:40:58,670
If you do,

401
00:40:59,963 --> 00:41:02,507
you invite our total destruction.

402
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:17,022
Any problem with that, Hirokawa?

403
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:20,400
No...

404
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:32,454
Mr Mayor, what do we do?

405
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,604
Peek-a...boo.

406
00:43:51,176 --> 00:43:52,844
I'll be back soon.

407
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:25,710
Mr Hirama!

408
00:44:27,879 --> 00:44:30,548
Kuramori escaped from his hotel room.

409
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,176
What about his guards?

410
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:35,220
He caught them by surprise.

411
00:44:35,387 --> 00:44:38,264
In that state, he might do anything.

412
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:51,569
Stop.

413
00:44:56,241 --> 00:45:01,413
Do you know what human beings call this?

414
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:06,251
A "coup d'état" or a "purge," maybe...

415
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,754
"Factional in-fighting" or "lynch mob"?

416
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,594
The birth of an organisation
is not without complications.

417
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,099
You're too involved with humans.

418
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:28,273
You thought three of you could defeat me?

419
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:15,320
I've got your baby.

420
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:22,994
Playing hardball, Mr Journalist...

421
00:46:27,123 --> 00:46:29,334
It's time for tactical operations.

422
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:36,841
We're to spearhead
the extermination of the parasites.

423
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:40,512
I want this to go by the book.

424
00:46:43,473 --> 00:46:45,850
All units, embark!

425
00:47:13,962 --> 00:47:15,171
Mr Kuramori?

426
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:24,180
<i>I'm glad you answered.
Where are you?</i>

427
00:47:25,807 --> 00:47:27,684
Listen...

428
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:30,687
I'll help you.

429
00:47:30,812 --> 00:47:33,189
Let's avenge your daughter.

430
00:47:35,316 --> 00:47:37,026
<i>I'll do it alone.</i>

431
00:47:38,486 --> 00:47:40,530
I'll kill the leader of the monsters...

432
00:47:41,906 --> 00:47:43,741
And the kid.

433
00:47:46,995 --> 00:47:49,372
Hello? Mr Kuramori?

434
00:47:51,332 --> 00:47:52,876
Did they get a trace?

435
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:54,711
Seems so.

436
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:08,433
Ms Tamiya?

437
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,734
Satomi Murano, right?

438
00:48:19,694 --> 00:48:22,405
Do you know where Izumi is?

439
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:28,244
I'm looking for him, too.
He won't answer his phone.

440
00:48:30,872 --> 00:48:32,081
Excuse me...

441
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:37,754
If you find out something,

442
00:48:38,379 --> 00:48:39,923
please let me know.

443
00:48:42,216 --> 00:48:43,760
You're worried?

444
00:48:52,018 --> 00:48:54,771
Higashi Fukuyama Zoo

445
00:49:01,402 --> 00:49:04,447
Tell me Izumi's mobile number.

446
00:49:30,556 --> 00:49:32,600
<i>You're safe, then?</i>

447
00:49:34,394 --> 00:49:35,770
It's you...

448
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:41,359
You sent that five-in-one thing to kill me?

449
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:44,112
It wasn't me who sent him.

450
00:49:44,737 --> 00:49:49,450
But he was the result
of one of my experiments.

451
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:53,037
You and your goddamn experiments.

452
00:49:56,749 --> 00:49:58,960
Maybe you're right.

453
00:50:03,756 --> 00:50:04,966
Let's go on a date.

454
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,637
<i>I need you to take care of something.</i>

455
00:50:10,596 --> 00:50:13,307
Come to Higashi Fukuyama Zoo.

456
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:30,783
Higashi Fukuyama City Hall

457
00:50:56,476 --> 00:50:59,771
This is an emergency.
I'm Mizukami of the Metropolitan Police.

458
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:02,440
It's vital that you all please listen.

459
00:51:03,316 --> 00:51:07,361
<i>A suspect with a hunting rifle
is loose in the building.</i>

460
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:11,032
<i>At this time, he's holed up on the roof.</i>

461
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:15,870
<i>We need all occupants to assemble
in the ground floor lobby.</i>

462
00:51:15,995 --> 00:51:17,038
<i>I repeat.</i>

463
00:51:17,163 --> 00:51:22,043
<i>All occupants are to assemble
in the ground floor lobby.</i>

464
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:33,721
<i>That's practically everyone.</i>

465
00:51:35,681 --> 00:51:37,725
Now we start the extermination.

466
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:43,064
<i>Stay calm, we will guide everyone
to safety outside.</i>

467
00:51:43,189 --> 00:51:46,067
<i>To avoid confusion, you'll be led in turn.</i>

468
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:53,199
<i>Please do as you're told and stay calm.</i>

469
00:51:53,366 --> 00:51:55,743
This line is to continue forward.

470
00:51:55,993 --> 00:52:02,083
<i>Everyone proceed in a calm manner.</i>

471
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:04,001
No need to hurry.

472
00:52:04,127 --> 00:52:07,171
Please proceed in single file.

473
00:52:07,964 --> 00:52:09,841
Keep going straight ahead.

474
00:52:12,468 --> 00:52:17,181
Watch your step, take it slow.

475
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:25,690
Target sighted.

476
00:52:27,984 --> 00:52:29,527
Excuse me, this way, please.

477
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:30,862
Others please proceed straight.

478
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:32,196
This way.

479
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:56,387
That's one. Next...

480
00:53:00,683 --> 00:53:05,897
You often brought your daughter here?

481
00:53:06,022 --> 00:53:07,231
Am I right?

482
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:17,074
I expected a bunch of police
but you're alone.

483
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:21,078
What do you want?

484
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:23,748
I wonder...

485
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:27,084
I'm not quite sure myself.

486
00:53:29,212 --> 00:53:31,756
I wanted to get my revenge

487
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:35,593
for getting me caught up in this.

488
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,431
I knew I couldn't easily kill you,

489
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:43,434
but I figured I could kill the kid.

490
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:47,605
So you'd know how I feel.

491
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:55,446
To make it worse,
I'd do it right in front of you.

492
00:53:56,906 --> 00:53:58,449
Or so I planned...

493
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:05,623
Totally illogical and yet so very human.

494
00:54:09,794 --> 00:54:10,795
Stop!

495
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:13,798
Don't come any closer.

496
00:54:21,764 --> 00:54:24,642
I'm a pretty useless father.

497
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:29,146
But after my wife died,

498
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:35,987
I did my best to raise her well...

499
00:54:37,863 --> 00:54:40,658
You know, it wasn't me

500
00:54:41,784 --> 00:54:43,327
who took your daughter.

501
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:44,996
It doesn't matter.

502
00:54:45,955 --> 00:54:48,499
You're still the ring-leader.

503
00:54:53,963 --> 00:54:55,631
Mr Kuramori, what are you doing?

504
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,844
You mustn't do that!

505
00:55:11,147 --> 00:55:12,857
Don't step out of line!

506
00:55:13,149 --> 00:55:14,859
Please do not move!

507
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:25,911
Please get back in line!

508
00:55:29,415 --> 00:55:30,416
Calm down!

509
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:32,376
<i>Parasites appearing on ground floor.</i>

510
00:55:32,835 --> 00:55:33,878
Roger.

511
00:55:36,464 --> 00:55:38,507
Get me the portable scanner.

512
00:56:02,031 --> 00:56:03,366
Is he holding a baby?

513
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,701
That's dangerous.

514
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,537
Killing the kid won't give you revenge.

515
00:56:08,996 --> 00:56:12,541
For her, motherhood is
all just an experiment.

516
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:15,711
They don't have feelings like we do.

517
00:56:15,836 --> 00:56:19,215
The goddamn parasite won't mourn
the kid's death.

518
00:56:20,341 --> 00:56:25,012
Then why the hell did she turn up here?

519
00:56:25,846 --> 00:56:27,223
Ryoko Tamiya!

520
00:56:28,682 --> 00:56:31,560
If your kid's precious, come take it.

521
00:56:32,353 --> 00:56:37,733
Show the good folk here
your monstrous transformation.

522
00:56:42,363 --> 00:56:46,742
Don't persecute us.

523
00:56:50,871 --> 00:56:54,917
We're frail creatures.

524
00:56:57,044 --> 00:56:59,422
In what way are you frail?

525
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:04,468
<i>Compared to the terrifying strength
of the human species,</i>

526
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:09,807
<i>we are wretched and frail.</i>

527
00:57:10,975 --> 00:57:12,643
<i>We can't survive by ourselves.</i>

528
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:15,479
<i>We're just a collection of cells.</i>

529
00:57:18,649 --> 00:57:19,817
So please...

530
00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:23,320
Go easy on us.

531
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,495
I was just passing by...

532
00:57:50,347 --> 00:57:51,849
What's the disturbance about?

533
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:07,031
I've been thinking...

534
00:58:08,866 --> 00:58:11,202
What is it that we represent?

535
00:58:12,203 --> 00:58:16,874
And what do humans represent to us?

536
00:58:19,543 --> 00:58:22,880
The conclusion I reached is that

537
00:58:23,714 --> 00:58:25,382
together

538
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:32,890
humans and parasites are like a family.

539
00:58:33,724 --> 00:58:34,892
A family?

540
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,394
It's as though

541
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:41,065
we're your children.

542
00:58:47,571 --> 00:58:49,406
And you two...

543
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:53,077
Binding us together...

544
00:58:54,578 --> 00:58:56,080
Are our hope for the future.

545
00:59:05,256 --> 00:59:06,924
Shinichi Izumi?

546
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:16,267
I'd like you to return my child.

547
00:59:17,935 --> 00:59:21,605
Mr Kuramori, let's stop this.

548
00:59:24,942 --> 00:59:29,446
Show everyone who you really are.

549
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:33,284
Humans and parasites

550
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:35,286
can never be family!

551
01:00:08,652 --> 01:00:10,279
That had you fooled.

552
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:15,117
As if a human being...

553
01:00:21,832 --> 01:00:25,836
Would ever kill a human child.

554
01:00:30,716 --> 01:00:32,176
Mr Kuramori!

555
01:00:39,308 --> 01:00:40,517
Don't move!

556
01:00:45,189 --> 01:00:46,315
Tamiya...

557
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:52,863
I'm surprised your parasite form
saved the child.

558
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,702
I was surprised, too.

559
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:22,851
<i>Excellent work.</i>

560
01:01:23,811 --> 01:01:27,189
<i>Your drastic measures
have exceeded expectations.</i>

561
01:01:28,148 --> 01:01:31,026
<i>I guess we can call it your victory.</i>

562
01:01:32,152 --> 01:01:38,492
<i>But then, when it comes to massacres
humans excel every time.</i>

563
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,705
<i>But the day will come when you realise</i>

564
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:50,045
<i>murder doesn't compare to your crime
of despoiling the environment.</i>

565
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:54,717
<i>Then it won't be long</i>

566
01:01:55,676 --> 01:02:02,057
<i>before you value our existence
and protect us parasites.</i>

567
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:08,564
<i>Value the role of your arch-enemy.</i>

568
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:22,745
<i>Stop caring about your own species.
Think of all life on earth.</i>

569
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:26,081
<i>Then you'll be the Lords of Creation.</i>

570
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:31,587
<i>You humans babble on about justice,</i>

571
01:02:32,713 --> 01:02:36,091
<i>but what about the greater justice?</i>

572
01:02:39,386 --> 01:02:45,100
<i>While we maintain a balance
between all life forms,</i>

573
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:51,106
<i>it's you humans who are parasitizing
every aspect of this planet!</i>

574
01:02:55,903 --> 01:02:57,196
No...

575
01:02:59,573 --> 01:03:02,284
<i>You're something worse than a parasite.</i>

576
01:03:07,414 --> 01:03:09,291
<i>You're a pestilence.</i>

577
01:03:11,502 --> 01:03:14,004
Are you done with your speech?

578
01:03:41,657 --> 01:03:44,284
This guy was human!

579
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:51,542
That was obvious from the start.

580
01:03:53,085 --> 01:03:55,379
That doesn't change the matter.

581
01:04:10,853 --> 01:04:12,229
Hirokawa, huh?

582
01:04:16,692 --> 01:04:20,571
One human that impressed Ryoko Tamiya.

583
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:23,907
She pinned high hopes on him.

584
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,577
He was a unique individual.

585
01:04:33,417 --> 01:04:36,086
What about this one?

586
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,756
Does he look human for even a second?

587
01:04:43,135 --> 01:04:44,177
Fire!

588
01:04:49,892 --> 01:04:51,435
I hear a voice in my head...

589
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:54,938
Telling me to devour them.

590
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:08,785
Izumi, back away from her.

591
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:15,125
Wait, don't go...

592
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,465
I've got something for you.

593
01:05:28,221 --> 01:05:29,222
Don't move.

594
01:05:29,348 --> 01:05:31,475
If you move, I'll shoot!

595
01:05:33,268 --> 01:05:34,811
Stay still. You'll be shot!

596
01:05:40,943 --> 01:05:42,486
This is my final warning!

597
01:05:43,445 --> 01:05:44,988
Stop or we'll shoot!

598
01:06:08,762 --> 01:06:12,641
Shinichi Izumi, Migi...

599
01:06:13,433 --> 01:06:14,977
This is good-bye.

600
01:06:20,273 --> 01:06:22,818
Open fire!

601
01:06:25,278 --> 01:06:26,989
Don't shoot. Stop!

602
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:36,206
Stop. The baby's human!

603
01:06:43,505 --> 01:06:48,218
You could easily have escaped.

604
01:06:50,971 --> 01:06:55,350
I've always asked the question...

605
01:06:58,145 --> 01:07:02,899
Why are we put on this earth?

606
01:07:05,402 --> 01:07:10,907
We solve one mystery
only for another to emerge.

607
01:07:12,367 --> 01:07:16,413
We long for beginnings only to
then long for endings.

608
01:07:17,539 --> 01:07:23,086
Heads spinning, we stumble forward.

609
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:28,425
Maybe it's all pointless.

610
01:07:29,718 --> 01:07:33,263
So then why even bother?

611
01:07:36,558 --> 01:07:39,436
Then, when it all comes to an end,

612
01:07:41,063 --> 01:07:43,440
we just have to resign ourselves.

613
01:07:46,568 --> 01:07:49,446
In any case, today...

614
01:07:49,905 --> 01:07:54,284
I found an answer to one of my questions.

615
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:05,962
I wish we could've had a life,

616
01:08:08,256 --> 01:08:12,636
this child and I together...

617
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:25,315
Raise him to be a normal child, please.

618
01:08:28,777 --> 01:08:33,323
He's a happy, healthy little boy.

619
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:56,179
The other day, I tried acting human.

620
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,350
I laughed out loud.

621
01:09:05,814 --> 01:09:08,692
It felt pretty good.

622
01:09:21,663 --> 01:09:22,873
She's dead.

623
01:09:24,499 --> 01:09:25,876
Tamiya...

624
01:09:36,845 --> 01:09:38,388
She's dead.

625
01:09:42,017 --> 01:09:43,560
Your mother's dead.

626
01:09:45,854 --> 01:09:47,898
She died protecting you.

627
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:32,442
Shinichi!

628
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,289
My tears...

629
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:52,963
Came back.

630
01:11:39,175 --> 01:11:40,677
I'll take him now.

631
01:11:48,518 --> 01:11:53,148
Izumi, I don't understand
your connection to these parasites,

632
01:11:53,273 --> 01:11:55,650
but I'd like some information from you.

633
01:11:57,027 --> 01:11:58,194
But Shinichi...

634
01:12:00,697 --> 01:12:01,698
Don't worry.

635
01:12:05,201 --> 01:12:08,204
That can't be true. Check again.

636
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:09,372
What is it?

637
01:12:10,874 --> 01:12:12,542
That operation at City Hall...

638
01:12:13,877 --> 01:12:15,045
The SAT team...

639
01:12:16,546 --> 01:12:18,048
It's been wiped out.

640
01:12:21,384 --> 01:12:22,552
Hello?

641
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,401
No way...

642
01:12:38,568 --> 01:12:40,945
It's the five-in-one parasite you killed.

643
01:12:41,863 --> 01:12:44,407
Yet it's totally transformed.

644
01:13:01,091 --> 01:13:03,635
He's in total control of the other four.

645
01:13:04,594 --> 01:13:06,262
He's an overwhelming force.

646
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:08,932
Let's run, I'm scared.

647
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:27,242
Get out of here.

648
01:13:36,126 --> 01:13:38,128
What on earth is it?

649
01:13:40,296 --> 01:13:41,631
Mr Hirama, sir!

650
01:13:45,468 --> 01:13:46,803
Mr Hirama!

651
01:14:00,608 --> 01:14:01,693
Wait!

652
01:14:03,653 --> 01:14:04,654
Shinichi!

653
01:14:04,821 --> 01:14:06,489
Can you drive?

654
01:14:06,656 --> 01:14:09,159
Japanese only took me a day.

655
01:14:42,525 --> 01:14:44,027
We're safe...

656
01:14:44,194 --> 01:14:46,362
Don't count your chickens.

657
01:14:47,363 --> 01:14:49,532
Goto is 100 metres away.

658
01:14:51,868 --> 01:14:53,036
Where the hell is he?

659
01:14:53,203 --> 01:14:54,370
Fifty meters.

660
01:14:55,038 --> 01:14:56,289
What's going on?

661
01:14:56,414 --> 01:14:58,374
Zero meters...

662
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,121
Did we do it?

663
01:15:37,247 --> 01:15:39,249
No, not yet.

664
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,417
He's a tough bastard.

665
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,936
It's no use. This is impossible.

666
01:16:04,274 --> 01:16:06,109
A spear's no match for a gun.

667
01:16:06,276 --> 01:16:10,280
Out-fought and out-run.
What would a human do?

668
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:12,949
Hiding's the only option.

669
01:16:13,116 --> 01:16:15,451
But your brain-waves give us away.

670
01:16:15,618 --> 01:16:17,620
Let's use that against him.

671
01:16:17,954 --> 01:16:21,291
It's me he can detect, not you.

672
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,462
But if it doesn't work?

673
01:16:26,963 --> 01:16:29,799
There's always plan B. Let's go.

674
01:17:12,008 --> 01:17:13,176
Didn't cut deep enough!

675
01:17:18,556 --> 01:17:21,100
Shinichi, I failed. Switch to plan B!

676
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,770
What the hell's that?

677
01:17:27,732 --> 01:17:29,609
Just do what I say.

678
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:31,235
What do I do?

679
01:17:32,904 --> 01:17:34,030
Run!

680
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:36,616
We mustn't both die.

681
01:17:37,116 --> 01:17:39,035
As long as one lives, we've succeeded.

682
01:17:40,787 --> 01:17:42,163
Don't be stupid!

683
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,292
You're the one being stupid!

684
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:47,543
Get out of here!

685
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:51,547
- Migi!
- Quick, get away!

686
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:54,217
I'm done for...

687
01:17:54,884 --> 01:17:55,885
Migi...

688
01:17:59,472 --> 01:18:00,848
Migi!

689
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:14,153
Run, Shinichi...

690
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:22,203
That's right...

691
01:18:23,162 --> 01:18:27,375
Without me, he'll never find you...

692
01:18:28,334 --> 01:18:31,129
Good job, Shinichi...

693
01:18:32,922 --> 01:18:37,427
When we met,
I failed to infect your brain.

694
01:18:38,386 --> 01:18:39,804
I'm glad now...

695
01:19:47,288 --> 01:19:49,832
Say NO to Nuclear Waste

696
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:47,932
Satomi?

697
01:20:48,057 --> 01:20:51,394
<i>Shinichi, where are you?</i>

698
01:21:19,255 --> 01:21:20,423
Sorry.

699
01:21:22,758 --> 01:21:23,926
Did that hurt?

700
01:21:24,969 --> 01:21:26,095
Satomi...

701
01:21:44,614 --> 01:21:46,449
Everyone's gone.

702
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:56,959
Everyone's dead.

703
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:08,971
I'm here.

704
01:22:17,313 --> 01:22:18,814
I'm right here!

705
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:37,833
You're still the old Shinichi.

706
01:22:41,087 --> 01:22:43,172
The chicken, the cry-baby.

707
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:47,677
The Shinichi I love...

708
01:25:19,954 --> 01:25:21,330
I feel as though...

709
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:26,502
All this was just a bad dream.

710
01:25:31,382 --> 01:25:33,008
It was a dream...

711
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:37,471
All Of it.

712
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:51,360
Migi?

713
01:25:52,695 --> 01:25:55,364
Were some of your cells left behind?

714
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:56,699
Shinichi?

715
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:00,536
This isn't good.

716
01:26:02,997 --> 01:26:04,165
He'll find us.

717
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:06,750
He'll be here!

718
01:26:06,876 --> 01:26:08,210
Shinichi!

719
01:26:21,557 --> 01:26:24,393
Excuse me, this is no entry.

720
01:26:27,897 --> 01:26:29,773
We should run, Shinichi.

721
01:26:29,899 --> 01:26:32,401
- He's looking for me.
- Let's escape.

722
01:26:32,568 --> 01:26:36,071
Keep running as far as it takes.

723
01:26:41,076 --> 01:26:43,662
- I've got to face him.
- Why? What can you do?

724
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:47,917
I don't know. But Migi tried.

725
01:26:49,585 --> 01:26:50,586
I promise I'll return.

726
01:26:54,757 --> 01:26:55,925
I'm here!

727
01:28:24,513 --> 01:28:26,056
Time to crush all hope.

728
01:28:58,339 --> 01:29:01,717
Give up. It's over.

729
01:29:51,683 --> 01:29:55,229
For ages, a voice
has been ringing in my ears

730
01:29:56,855 --> 01:29:58,899
urging me to devour humans.

731
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,113
Someone on this planet had the idea

732
01:30:05,197 --> 01:30:07,282
that all life needs protecting.

733
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:10,953
Who was that? Another life form?

734
01:30:17,209 --> 01:30:18,419
It's you, yourselves.

735
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:24,091
What do you mean?

736
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:31,598
Above all, mankind's increase
is a threat to mankind itself.

737
01:30:35,394 --> 01:30:40,107
It's man that whispers in my ear.

738
01:30:46,071 --> 01:30:48,782
We're actually trying to save you.

739
01:31:17,436 --> 01:31:18,479
Hi!

740
01:31:19,438 --> 01:31:20,481
Migi?

741
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:25,861
You were absorbed into him?

742
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:29,198
I sabotaged his nervous system, too.

743
01:31:29,531 --> 01:31:30,866
It was my plan C.

744
01:31:32,367 --> 01:31:33,869
I swear...

745
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:36,622
You're a law unto yourself.

746
01:31:53,055 --> 01:31:54,223
A rebellion's going on.

747
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:59,561
The subordinate parasite cells
are fleeing the impending danger.

748
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:02,397
Victory is yours, Shinichi.

749
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:03,899
Why?

750
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:05,901
Wasn't it intentional?

751
01:32:07,236 --> 01:32:11,406
That pipe you used was coated
with radioactive waste.

752
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:13,075
Radioactive waste?

753
01:32:28,298 --> 01:32:29,508
Wow...

754
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:33,595
Let's put him out of his misery.

755
01:32:39,268 --> 01:32:40,769
You fought well.

756
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:43,438
Let me help you, comrade.

757
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:09,590
The strongest parasite is dead.

758
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:19,266
Incredible. His heart is still beating.

759
01:33:20,225 --> 01:33:22,561
The head is still putting out a call,

760
01:33:23,395 --> 01:33:28,108
trying to summon all the fragments
to somehow regenerate.

761
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,776
Is that possible?

762
01:33:29,901 --> 01:33:31,278
A 50/50 chance.

763
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:33,530
We should finish him off.

764
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:45,125
<i>We're frail creatures...</i>

765
01:33:46,752 --> 01:33:47,794
So please...

766
01:33:49,755 --> 01:33:51,298
Go easy on us.

767
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,830
No final blow?

768
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:27,000
Do we really...

769
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:32,506
Have the right to kill him?

770
01:34:34,966 --> 01:34:37,844
If that's your decision, so be it.

771
01:34:46,144 --> 01:34:47,187
What is it?

772
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:28,937
You weren't in the wrong...

773
01:35:33,442 --> 01:35:34,776
You're not to blame.

774
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:40,282
It's just that I...

775
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:45,120
I had something to protect.

776
01:36:52,354 --> 01:36:53,688
I'm sorry...

777
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:57,692
We...

778
01:37:01,363 --> 01:37:02,531
Us, humans...

779
01:37:06,201 --> 01:37:08,370
We still want to keep living.

780
01:38:05,343 --> 01:38:08,597
No time to rest if you're trying to catch up.

781
01:38:08,763 --> 01:38:10,098
Just a few minutes.

782
01:38:10,265 --> 01:38:11,433
Shinichi.

783
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:14,936
I've been thinking recently.

784
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:16,771
What?

785
01:38:16,938 --> 01:38:20,567
Parasite activity is out of the news, right?

786
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:22,444
That's true.

787
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:24,988
It's not like you were all exterminated.

788
01:38:25,113 --> 01:38:29,784
Tamiya, Goto and those massacred
were a small minority.

789
01:38:29,951 --> 01:38:32,746
Why are the others behaving?

790
01:38:33,622 --> 01:38:34,831
I wonder...

791
01:38:35,123 --> 01:38:36,458
They've changed.

792
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:40,295
They've changed lifestyles
and feeding habits

793
01:38:40,545 --> 01:38:43,131
and become adept at blending in.

794
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:48,803
Ryoko Tamiya's "coexistence"
is becoming a reality.

795
01:38:50,138 --> 01:38:51,139
So...

796
01:38:51,473 --> 01:38:53,308
I have changed, too.

797
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:54,476
You have?

798
01:38:54,809 --> 01:38:57,812
Shinichi, I'm thinking of leaving.

799
01:38:58,146 --> 01:38:59,648
What are you talking about?

800
01:38:59,814 --> 01:39:03,485
That nuclear waste caused havoc
to my cellular structure.

801
01:39:03,985 --> 01:39:07,489
I've been working on the repair ever since,

802
01:39:07,989 --> 01:39:10,659
exhausting healthy cells in the process.

803
01:39:11,826 --> 01:39:13,161
Really...

804
01:39:13,328 --> 01:39:14,496
With the result that

805
01:39:14,663 --> 01:39:17,332
it's hard for me to maintain this form.

806
01:39:18,333 --> 01:39:21,670
I need to begin a long period of dormancy.

807
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:26,841
It might be years, decades...
My entire life, maybe.

808
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:30,845
It means you get your right hand back.

809
01:39:30,929 --> 01:39:31,930
Wait a minute...

810
01:39:32,013 --> 01:39:36,184
Don't worry. It's just a shut-down.

811
01:39:37,018 --> 01:39:40,355
Now's a good time to take my own path.

812
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:42,857
A journey deep inside myself.

813
01:39:43,024 --> 01:39:44,693
What do you mean?

814
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:48,697
Imagine this was all a dream...

815
01:39:48,863 --> 01:39:50,532
I can't do that.

816
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:53,702
You're right in front of me.

817
01:39:54,703 --> 01:39:57,706
For sure, I'm definitely real.

818
01:39:58,748 --> 01:40:02,711
And although we endured
so much hardship,

819
01:40:05,797 --> 01:40:08,008
we have to part now.

820
01:40:08,466 --> 01:40:09,634
Migi...

821
01:40:10,468 --> 01:40:13,013
I'm leaving, flipping the switch...

822
01:40:13,138 --> 01:40:14,347
Wait.

823
01:40:15,807 --> 01:40:19,519
Don't I get to talk to you again?

824
01:40:20,478 --> 01:40:21,688
Maybe not...

825
01:40:23,148 --> 01:40:26,693
Talking to your own hand is odd, anyway.

826
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:32,699
You know how you forget a dream
when you wake?

827
01:40:33,283 --> 01:40:35,201
Forget me the same way.

828
01:40:35,827 --> 01:40:37,537
Wait a minute, Migi.

829
01:40:37,829 --> 01:40:40,707
This is just a hand here.

830
01:40:41,499 --> 01:40:45,045
The right hand you missed so badly.

831
01:40:47,172 --> 01:40:48,548
Migi...

832
01:40:50,675 --> 01:40:52,052
Shinichi.

833
01:40:53,178 --> 01:40:55,055
Thanks for everything.

834
01:41:03,354 --> 01:41:04,397
Migi?

835
01:41:06,524 --> 01:41:10,236
Wake up, Migi...

836
01:41:13,865 --> 01:41:15,575
Is that it?

837
01:41:20,205 --> 01:41:22,248
I swear...

838
01:41:24,375 --> 01:41:26,920
You're just a law unto yourself.

839
01:41:33,635 --> 01:41:35,929
Don't ask me to forget you.

840
01:41:39,891 --> 01:41:43,103
How could I ever do that, you jerk?

841
01:42:08,086 --> 01:42:09,462
Sorry, sorry...

842
01:42:09,754 --> 01:42:11,464
Hey, you...

843
01:42:11,589 --> 01:42:12,799
I thought you stood me up.

844
01:42:12,924 --> 01:42:13,967
I fell back to sleep again.

845
01:42:14,092 --> 01:42:15,301
You're terrible.

846
01:42:25,645 --> 01:42:27,272
Taiki Tamiya.

847
01:42:30,859 --> 01:42:31,860
Taiki.

848
01:42:34,028 --> 01:42:35,029
Will he grow tall?

849
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,869
Look, they're selling coffee.

850
01:42:40,994 --> 01:42:42,203
You're right.

851
01:42:42,996 --> 01:42:44,706
It looks good.

852
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:45,874
What?

853
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:48,376
I have to get you one?

854
01:42:48,835 --> 01:42:51,546
Your punishment for being late.

855
01:42:52,005 --> 01:42:53,214
Me?

856
01:43:23,203 --> 01:43:24,245
Satomi!

857
01:43:40,053 --> 01:43:41,262
Damn!

858
01:43:42,889 --> 01:43:46,100
Hey, what are you doing?

859
01:43:46,392 --> 01:43:47,602
Do you hear me?

860
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,287
It's so damn cute...

861
01:44:07,247 --> 01:44:09,457
So scared, she barely makes a noise.

862
01:44:09,582 --> 01:44:12,126
Stop it. What do you want?

863
01:44:12,585 --> 01:44:15,296
You might not know me but...

864
01:44:15,755 --> 01:44:18,299
I remember you very well.

865
01:44:19,425 --> 01:44:21,302
Which brings me to my question.

866
01:44:22,762 --> 01:44:25,640
I need answers from a non-human viewpoint.

867
01:44:29,602 --> 01:44:34,816
Monsters kill us for food, that's simple.

868
01:44:35,775 --> 01:44:40,488
What am I, then? Why do I kill?

869
01:44:44,951 --> 01:44:47,829
The answer is that I'm a genuine human.

870
01:44:50,164 --> 01:44:54,168
Humans have always been
a murderous species.

871
01:44:54,627 --> 01:44:57,839
Slaughtering each other
for thousands of years.

872
01:44:59,424 --> 01:45:04,012
I want a monster's opinion from you.

873
01:45:07,473 --> 01:45:09,851
I'm a truly representative human, right?

874
01:45:11,561 --> 01:45:12,854
Answer me!

875
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:25,033
I guess so...

876
01:45:31,497 --> 01:45:33,541
- Maybe you're right.
- Shinichi!

877
01:45:34,709 --> 01:45:37,045
You don't have to answer this jerk.

878
01:45:38,087 --> 01:45:41,049
There's nothing human about you.

879
01:45:41,924 --> 01:45:46,387
Quiet as a mouse and now all full of energy.

880
01:45:46,596 --> 01:45:51,059
I'm not afraid of you one bit. I pity you.

881
01:45:51,351 --> 01:45:54,395
That's enough. Stay quiet.

882
01:45:58,524 --> 01:46:00,568
Shinichi is truly human.

883
01:46:02,945 --> 01:46:06,074
He values life, no matter how small.

884
01:46:11,412 --> 01:46:13,289
You're the monster!

885
01:46:52,412 --> 01:46:53,454
Satomi...

886
01:46:55,748 --> 01:46:56,958
It's OK...

887
01:46:58,751 --> 01:47:00,461
I'm going to save you...

888
01:47:02,463 --> 01:47:03,798
Believe me...

889
01:47:51,304 --> 01:47:52,513
Why?

890
01:47:53,639 --> 01:47:55,683
Why, for chrissakes?

891
01:48:09,697 --> 01:48:14,202
<i>Remember that dead puppy
by the side of the road?</i>

892
01:48:15,703 --> 01:48:17,872
It meant nothing to us, right?

893
01:48:19,207 --> 01:48:21,542
Then why were we sad?

894
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:27,381
Because human beings sympathise
with the suffering of others.

895
01:48:28,216 --> 01:48:31,385
They like to live in proximity
with other species.

896
01:48:31,719 --> 01:48:34,722
That's one endearing characteristic
you guys have.

897
01:48:35,264 --> 01:48:38,226
You can't help but offer a hand sometimes.

898
01:48:39,227 --> 01:48:43,231
So Shinichi, will you please quit moping?

899
01:48:44,065 --> 01:48:45,900
I'm tired. Take hold of her.

900
01:48:51,405 --> 01:48:52,657
Satomi?

901
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,201
Satomi?

902
01:49:00,081 --> 01:49:01,249
Satomi!

903
01:49:07,922 --> 01:49:09,090
Are you OK?

904
01:49:33,781 --> 01:49:34,949
Migi...

905
01:49:38,452 --> 01:49:39,954
Is it you, Migi?

906
01:49:48,296 --> 01:49:49,463
Are you there?

907
01:50:03,644 --> 01:50:05,479
Thank you.

908
01:50:17,992 --> 01:50:19,160
Satomi.

909
01:50:26,792 --> 01:50:28,336
Remember...

910
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:35,843
That dead puppy?
The one I threw in the trash?

911
01:50:41,474 --> 01:50:43,517
I meant to tell you for ages...

912
01:50:46,979 --> 01:50:49,357
I thought it over,

913
01:50:54,153 --> 01:50:56,697
and buried it under a tree.

914
01:51:03,663 --> 01:51:05,206
I know...

915
01:51:09,669 --> 01:51:11,712
Because that's who you are.

916
01:51:14,507 --> 01:51:17,051
Because you're Shinichi...
