[applause]

00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,699
- Aloha.
- [all] Aloha.

6
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,802
Today the Galactic Council
assembles

7
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,272
to honor Lilo and Stitch,

8
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,942
who have successfully
captured all 625

9
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,145
of Jumba's
genetic experiments,

10
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,247
turned them
from bad to good,

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,649
and found each a place
where it can belong.

12
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:25,653
[applause]

13
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,821
To recognize the completion
of their task,

14
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,823
the Galactic Council
has elected to bestow

15
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,659
the following rewards...

16
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,794
[gasps]
You hear that, Jumba?

17
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,829
We're gonna
get prizes.

18
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,841
Dr. Jumba Jookiba,

19
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,244
we hereby return
the confiscated key

20
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,280
- to your laboratory.
- Hah!

21
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:56,650
With old lab back,
evil possibilities are infinite!

22
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,153
Agent Wendy Pleakley...

23
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:01,622
[snores]

24
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,158
we hereby offer you
the chair of Earth Studies

25
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:06,527
at the GACC.

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,529
Ohh.

27
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,165
Galactic Alliance
Community College?

28
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,766
Yes!

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,702
As for Stitch,

30
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,205
you are hereby
offered a commission

31
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,173
as captain of
the Galactic Armada

32
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:24,545
and commander of its
new flagship the BRB-9000.

33
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,049
Ooh. BRB.

34
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,319
What's BRB
stand for?

35
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:35,956
Big Red Battleship!
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,659
Finally, Lilo Pelekai,

37
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,195
you shall become our
first Earth ambassador

38
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,863
and return to Kauai

39
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,233
to be the experiments'
sole caretaker.

40
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,535
[applause]

41
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,008
You mean Jumba and Pleakley
and Stitch aren't coming home?

42
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:05,819
Stitch wants to come back
to Kauai. Right, Stitch?

43
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,822
Oh, uh, Kauai.

44
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,592
Yeah.

45
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,194
Maybe everybody
wants to go back?

46
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:17,865
- Right. Of course.
- Right.

47
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,634
Don't you have
something to say?

48
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,538
Oh, yeah, right.

49
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,574
I'm wishing to go back
to stinky water planet

50
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,209
and share bunk bed
with bossy one-eyed noodle.

51
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,679
Is this your
final decision?

52
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,747
[all] Um...

53
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,289
- Eeh.
- Absolutely.

54
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,791
I suppose.
Or maybe...

55
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,493
Then so be it.

56
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,796
[electricity crackles]

57
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,865
* Aloha

58
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,269
* Ohana

59
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,830
[foghorn bellowing]

60
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,050
[Lilo] Now that we're done
catching experiments,

61
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,820
we can do whatever we want.

62
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,955
I want to finish
my logbook.

63
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,324
It's got a picture
of every experiment,

64
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,794
in the one place
they belong.

65
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,862
What do you want
to do, Stitch?

66
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,702
Hmm...
[humming]

67
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,804
- [grunts]
- [pipe creaks]

68
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,839
And, uh... Huh?

69
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,675
- [rustling]
- [Stitch muttering]

70
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,578
Ee-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

71
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:48,649
[imitates jets roaring]

72
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,851
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

73
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,253
[gibberish]

74
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,725
Scale model
of Big Red Battleship.

75
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,259
Impressive.

76
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,062
[microwave beeps]

77
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,164
Where are you taking
the microwave?

78
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,867
Hah! Without
evil genius lab,

79
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,869
Jumba must energize
genetic experiments

80
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,871
with primitive
Earth popcorn maker.

81
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,873
You know,
the microwave oven

82
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,842
was invented
by Dr. Percy Spencer.

83
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,877
Ah, who cares?

84
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,179
If you were a student
at GACC you'd care

85
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,549
'cause it would be
on the final exam.

86
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,786
And what do we
call this, class?

87
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,220
Breakfast?

88
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,690
Specifically,
grain-based flakes

89
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,859
immersed in bovine
gland extract.

90
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,894
Eww!

91
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,030
I'm off to work.
Oh, Pleakley.

92
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,767
I need you to fix
Lilo's skirt for hula class.

93
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,236
Only if you answer this extra
credit question correctly.

94
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,807
Where did the native Hawaiian
hula dance originate?

95
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,744
- Uh, Hawaii?
- Very good, Nani!

96
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,646
If you were attending GACC,

97
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,648
I'd move you
to the head of the class.

98
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:57,785
- [imitates jets roaring]
- [crash]

99
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,955
[turbine backfires]

100
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,764
[Gantu] Blitznak!

101
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:15,235
Without the reserve engines,
this ship is stupid and useless.

102
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,005
- Just like you.
- [sighs] Who am I kidding?

103
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,007
You're right.

104
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,943
I couldn't hold on to a single
one of those experiments.

105
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,244
You still got me,

106
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,914
your faithful
sandwich-making pal.

107
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:31,251
Yes. I noticed the little
Earth girl never captured you.

108
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,253
I guessed the one place
I belonged

109
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,023
was with my
blubber-butt buddy Gantu.

110
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,926
Maybe that was
my problem all along.

111
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,962
What? Your blubber butt?
[chuckles]

112
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,733
Gantu?

113
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,976
So, we're taking the old
two-man shuttle, huh? Heh-heh.

114
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,946
Hey, you want I should fix
a picnic lunch for the trip?

115
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,615
There's only room for two
on the two-man shuttle,

116
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,051
me and Dr. Hamsterviel.

117
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,020
- I'm breaking him
out of prison.
- What?

118
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,022
This is my last chance
to redeem myself.

119
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,725
If I succeed,
my future is secured.

120
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,995
What about my future? How am I
supposed to pay the bills?

121
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,865
Why not make sandwiches?
It's all you're good at.

122
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,701
- Maybe I will!
- Fine.

123
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,803
You're gonna miss
my egg salad!

124
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,073
Not enough mayonnaise
and too much dill weed.

125
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,876
What did you call me?

126
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,922
- [generator starts]
- [beep]

127
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,224
- [crackling]
- [beeps]

128
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,695
Aagh! Primitive
Earth science.

129
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,603
Jumba...

130
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,005
...what was
your old lab like?

131
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,009
Ah ha ha ha!
Galaxy Defense Industries.

132
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,344
State-of-art
genetic accelerator.

133
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,780
Endless uburnium
energy supply.

134
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:10,017
Everything little boy Jumba
ever dreamed of having

135
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,086
in evil genius laboratory!
[laughs]

136
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,959
Hah... Um, but popcorn power
is good too.

137
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,994
[beeps]

138
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:29,737
[Pleakley]
Welcome, students,
to Earthiana 101.

139
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,739
Quiet, class. Quiet!

140
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,774
Plooka,
spit out that gum!

141
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,809
Lenlu, stop playing
with your antenna.

142
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,811
- Pleakley.
- Aah! Oh, Lilo!

143
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,813
Don't pay
any attention to me.

144
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,315
I wasn't pretending to be
a professor of Earth Studies,

145
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:46,720
just like I dreamed of
since before I could walk
on three legs.

146
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:50,858
Not at all! I was just, uh,
uh... brushing my tongues!

147
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,268
BRB.

148
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,526
Scrump, have I ever
told you the story

149
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,561
of the Lonely Rooster?

150
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,600
Once there was a rooster
named Pancake.

151
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,669
He was lonely.

152
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,305
So he went to the beach
to make friends.

153
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,774
He made friends
with a shell named Paula

154
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,610
and an empty can of soda
named Jimmy

155
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,047
and a piece of a broken
surfboard named Steve.

156
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,151
They were good friends
and had fun playing together.

157
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,955
But then one day a big wave
splashed over the whole beach

158
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,525
and washed Paula and Jimmy
and Steve away.

159
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,861
[wave crashes]

160
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,864
Pancake was sad
that his friends were gone.

161
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,633
But Pancake
was never lonely again,

162
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,237
because he could always
remember them.

163
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,272
The end.

164
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,512
Lilo, are you OK?

165
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,815
Scrump and I are
getting used to the way

166
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,152
things used to be.

167
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,255
So, you're letting them go.

168
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,523
They'll say
they want to stay,

169
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,525
but it's just because

170
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,561
they don't want me
to be sad.

171
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:37,831
They'll be OK
without me, right?

172
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,833
Oh, Lilo.

173
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:43,170
You're showing so much
aloha spirit letting them go.

174
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,840
And the aloha you give
will always come back to you.

175
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,842
It's like a circle.

176
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,880
Aloha means hello,
but it also means goodbye.

177
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,615
It's hard to say goodbye.

178
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,717
I know, baby.

179
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,623
Goodbye, laundry!
Goodbye, dirty dishes!

180
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,860
Goodbye, dust bunnies.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!

181
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:10,530
Nani says that letting you go
shows aloha spirit,

182
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,934
and that the aloha you give
will always come back to you.

183
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,237
Eh, interesting theory
but scientifically impossible.

184
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,639
I'm estimating
23 percent aloha

185
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,042
- is lost in giving process.
- [beakers break]

186
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,311
You know, aloha is one
of those Earth concepts

187
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,546
I never did understand.

188
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,548
Come, Pleakley. Oof!

189
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,550
What is in here,
bricks?

190
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,552
Concrete, adobe,
terra cotta...

191
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,654
You name the brick,
it's in there.

192
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,690
My students are sure
to find them fascinating.

193
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:09,089
Jumba, you belong back in your
real evil genius laboratory.

194
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,792
But if you're ever missing
Kauai, you can play this.

195
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:16,029
It's my favorite
Elvis record.

196
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:19,967
Pleakley, you belong at Galactic
Alliance Community College

197
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,802
teaching Earth stuff
to aliens.

198
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,872
That's why I'm
giving you this rock.

199
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,674
Here it's just
a dumb old paperweight,

200
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:30,177
but out there it'll be
a dumb old paperweight

201
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,179
from another planet.

202
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,814
I'll keep it
with me always.

203
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,918
And, Stitch,
you belong...

204
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,891
I'll miss you too.

205
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,797
But you belong
out in space,

206
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,967
catching bad guys with
the Big Red Battleship.

207
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,070
This is a very
special necklace.

208
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:01,741
I kept it hidden in
a sock for three years.

209
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,744
It's Ku Tiki,
the god of strength.

210
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,947
Promise to never
take it off?

211
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,685
- Promise.
- You're number 626.

212
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:17,690
- Name: Stitch.
- [camera clicks]

213
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,239
Aloha.

214
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,042
Aloha.

215
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,625
[alarm blaring]

216
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,953
Don't worry,
Dr. Hamsterviel,

217
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:21,955
your escape
will soon be complete.

218
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,890
What do you mean
"complete"?

219
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,059
You haven't even broken me
out of my cell!

220
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,061
Then who is this?

221
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,164
That's the warden's gerbil,
you nearsighted fish stick!

222
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,600
[laughter]

223
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,602
Hmm. He looks
just like you.

224
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,870
[P.A.] Security command,
release portal 7.

225
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,044
Run! Run!

226
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,714
And put down
that gerbil!

227
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,826
I brought you
a little surprise.

228
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,029
- What is it?
- An Earth souvenir.

229
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,797
They call it an aloha lei.
It symbolizes...

230
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,766
Excellent!
I'm starving!

231
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,835
Wait! Wait!
You're not supposed to...

232
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,171
[burps]

233
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,972
Never mind.

234
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:39,866
- [clears throat] Aloha.
- Captain Stitch.

235
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,102
The Council has received...

236
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,705
You have coconut cake
on your uniform.

237
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:50,177
Oh. Sorry.
[slurps]

238
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,812
The Council has received
a security alert.

239
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,881
With the aid
of the former Captain Gantu,

240
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,851
Dr. Jacques von Hamsterviel
has escaped from prison.

241
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,588
- [gibberish]
- This is your first mission

242
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,923
as captain of
the Galactic Armada.

243
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,060
Seek out and capture
Dr. Hamsterviel.

244
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:11,231
It will also be
the maiden voyage of...

245
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:17,036
- Oh!
- ...the BRB-9000.

246
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,073
- [man] BRB fueling complete.
- [woman] Hatchway secure.

247
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,275
[man] Captain has
arrived in the bay.

248
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,677
Oh! Big Red...

249
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,614
[playing march]

250
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,916
Whoo-hoo! Aah!

251
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,584
[cymbal crash]

252
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,060
He, uh, went in
through the air manifold.

253
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,763
- [door beeps]
- Captain on the...

254
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,633
- [Stitch laughs]
- ...ceiling?

255
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,735
Big Red, Big Red, Big Red!

256
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,939
Huh?

257
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,007
[seat motor whirring]

258
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,579
[clicks]

259
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:08,155
Hmm. [gibberish]

260
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,190
[computer]
Hyperdrive activated...

261
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,630
Captain, you're certain
you want to engage

262
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,966
the H-drive
in the spaceport?

263
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,068
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

264
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,171
[boosters firing]

265
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,847
Well, he's certainly
enthusiastic.

266
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:38,518
Yeeow! [cackles]

267
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,160
Is there anything else I can
get for you, Professor Pleakley?

268
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,796
Why, yes.
You could give me

269
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,165
a great big pinch
to wake me up!

270
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,667
I've got a huge
corner office,

271
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,637
a complete set of
the Encyclopedia Earthiana,

272
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,806
my very own walk-in closet,

273
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,210
the keys to the college
carpool van, and...

274
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,779
...galaxy-wide fame as the
greatest Earth expert ever!

275
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,617
[gasp] Is that
a real Earth rock?

276
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,952
Why, yes.
Yes, it is.

277
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,054
You've actually been
to Earth?

278
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,989
You must tell me everything.

279
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,226
Of course.
But you will have to wait

280
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,228
for my first lecture,

281
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,197
"Perspectives on Earthiana:
A One-Eyed View."

282
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:27,166
Lecture?
You don't give lectures.

283
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,168
I don't?

284
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:32,872
Oh. Well, then, in my
first class you can always...

285
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,807
And you don't have
classes either.

286
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,909
You're a supervising
professor.

287
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,911
That's why you get
all this great stuff:

288
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,980
the office,
the encyclopedias,

289
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,182
your own walk-in closet
and wardrobe.

290
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,518
Oh, right.

291
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:49,556
Could we take a look at
that, um, new wardrobe?

292
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:54,527
Ah! Jumba's
evil scientist laboratory.

293
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:57,163
Is just as I left it!

294
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,833
So many wonderful memories
of evil experimentation,

295
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,603
ending with disgrace,
arrest and imprisonment,

296
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,239
but still
wonderful memories.

297
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:10,009
So much new evil
to be done. Heh-heh-heh!

298
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,680
Where to begin?
Antiaircraft lollipops?

299
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,048
Oh! Permanently stinky
bedroom slippers?

300
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,785
Or perhaps device to stop
evil genius talking to self.

301
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,488
Heh-heh-heh-heh!
Eh, silly Jumba.

302
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,757
It's rounds time,
Scrump.

303
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,759
I used to do it
with Stitch,

304
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,695
but you can
help me instead.

305
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,197
We just check to make sure
that all Stitch's cousins

306
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,535
are still happy
in the one place they belong.

333
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,697
Wow! Wasp Mummies VI
is already out.

334
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,766
I hope my dad will
let me go see it.

335
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,834
- Well, I heard...
- Aloha, Myrtle.

336
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,536
Where are you
taking Gigi?

337
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,638
I'm taking her
to the canine spa.

338
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,607
What'd you do
with your dog?

339
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,109
He's an outer space pilot
in a Big Red Battleship

340
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,313
- and fighting bad guys.
- [Gigi whimpers]

341
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,983
Is not!
You're a weirdo!

342
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,185
- [girls] Yeah!
- No, I'm not!

343
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:02,021
I'm done doing
all that weird stuff now.

344
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,524
Wanna play dolls?

345
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,860
No way! Once a weirdo,
always a weirdo.

346
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,996
That's what my dad
used to say.

347
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:13,165
- I didn't know you had a dad.
- Quiet, Yuki.

348
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,068
In fact, I bet that's why
your dog ran away,

349
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:19,038
and I also bet that
he's never coming back.

350
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,174
- [girls] Yeah!
- Just like Myrtle's dad.

351
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,243
Quiet, Yuki!

352
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,149
Hey! Wait up!

353
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,184
Come on, Scrump.

354
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,734
[Nani] Lilo! I told you
you can't stay out after sunset.

355
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:51,804
- OK.
- OK?

356
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,041
[groans]

357
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,545
You did the right thing.

358
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:02,281
- Letting them go shows...
- [muffled] Aloha. I know.

359
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,552
[bubbling]

360
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:08,888
Add two tablespoons
genetic material and...

361
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:16,596
Hah! I've perfected
evil genius boom-boom liquid

362
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,931
for saliva of new experiment.
[laughs]

363
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,633
Pleakley! Come look!

364
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,102
Pleak... [echoes]

365
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,140
I'm forgetting.
No Pleakley, just Jumba.

366
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:31,177
Shh! Who you talking to?
Shh! Stop that.

[glass breaks]

368
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,491
[Elvis] I'd like
to sing a song

369
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:47,627
that's probably the saddest
song I've ever heard.

- Jumba!
- Dr. Hamsterviel!

394
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,965
I see I have found you
recollecting

395
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,234
misty musical
recollections.

396
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,805
Why are you no longer on
asteroid of inescapable prison?

397
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,541
No prison can contain me!

398
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,946
I... I mean, I am fully
reformed. Out on parole.

399
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,248
I heard you were
opening up the old shop.

400
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,084
So I am thinking...
[sniffs]

401
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,186
maybe we could work
together again.

402
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,791
[sighs]
Remember the old days?

403
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,760
You creating
experiments,

404
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:36,495
I funding them with my
shady business deals.

405
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,631
- No.
- Oh, come on!

406
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:42,635
Graduating together
from Evil Genius U?

407
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:45,571
- [scoffs]
- Our first business together?

408
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,906
[scoffs]

409
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,575
What about creating
our first experiment?

410
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,811
You remember Shrink?

411
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,781
25 years of partnership,

412
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:57,650
and you did nothing
but cheat Jumba,

413
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,086
embarrass Jumba,
steal from Jumba,

414
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,522
and finally fink on Jumba
to Galactic Federation.

415
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,660
For you, I wouldn't create
piece of dry toast!

416
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:10,830
Very well, then.
You leave me no choice

417
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,766
but to forcibly force you
to make a new experiment

418
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,302
by force!

419
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,638
By force! By force!
That was your cue!

420
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:21,674
Sorry.

421
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:27,279
Now, Jumba, I will
explain this only once

422
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,648
and oh, so patiently.

423
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:32,819
I want to order
a new version of 626.

424
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,521
Make him with extra
destructive capabilities

425
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,523
but easy on the fluffy.

426
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,525
And I don't like blue.

427
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,327
So make him
resplendent red

428
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,196
to match my cape,
and make him to go!

429
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,134
Jumba makes genius experiments,
not fast food.

430
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,737

just to create design.

I just miss you so much!

444
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:41,287
I mean, heh, I just happen to be
in your quadrant, so I thought,

445
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,922
maybe I'll drop by.

446
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,057
- Enough! Hang up!
- No.

00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,960
No? But don't you miss
your Aunt Pleakley?

- No!
- I'm wearing the wig.

No! Not coming by.
Never coming by!

Never wanting
seeing you again.

Yeah?
Well, me neither!

452
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:01,240
What I meant when I said
"I miss you so much

453
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,210
and can I visit?" was
"I don't miss you at all

454
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,013
and I never ever want to see
you ever again ever either!"

455

- [cries]
- Is truly evil!

to be mean to Pleakley.

457

[dinging]

529
00:34:56,962 --> 00:35:00,632
- Captain on this... floor.

[speaks gibberish]

532
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,940
Captain setting
destination coordinates.

533
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,842
Zero parsec?

534
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,679
Captain Stitch, our orders
are to return the prisoner

535
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,814
to Asteroid K-37.

536
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,816
Why are we setting
a course for Turo?

537
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,586
- [snarls]
- [speaks gibberish]

538
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,289
[gasps]
You're not the captain!

539
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:27,025
He is now!

[line ringing]

542
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,306
[man] Hello,
this is Cobra Bubbles.

543
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,508
Cobra, I want
to call Stitch.

544
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,543
I'm unable to come to
the phone right now.

545
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,546
My current location:
classified.

546
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,549
Estimated return time:
classified.

547
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,984
Have a nice day.

548
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,020
[sighs]

549
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,528
[Nani] Does Scrump
want some breakfast?

550
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:05,697
It's her favorite,
cold pizza.

551
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,168
She's not hungry.

552
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,671
She's worried
about Stitch.

553
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,541
Aww, Stitch can
take care of himself.

554
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,543
He's indestructible,
remember?

555
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,245
I told Scrump that,

556
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:22,514
but she gets feelings
sometimes.

557
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,583
She thinks
something's wrong.

558
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,686
so I've been trying to
get in touch with Stitch.

559
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,688
Oh, 'cause
you're gonna need

560
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,690
one of those intergalactic
communicator thingies

561
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,692
if you want
to contact him.

562
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:36,528
I know! But Jumba and
Pleakley's ship is gone,

563
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:38,830
and Pleakley took
his space cell phone.

564
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:42,834
Who else?
Out of my way!

565
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,604
- I need peanut butter!
- For breakfast?

566
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,811
Hello?

567
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,882
Hmmph, Gantu schmantu.
Who needs him?

568
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,917
Nothing but a pain
in the patookie anyhow.

569
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,786
Didn't even like
my egg salad.

570
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,522
"More mayonnaise,
less dill weed."

571
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,958
- Uh, hello?
- Sorry, we're not open.

572
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,295
- Open?
- I'm turning this dump

573
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:13,699
into the best spaceship-shaped
sandwich shop on the island.

574
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,001
- Where's Gantu?
- He left.

575
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,137
But I'm naming
a sandwich after him,

576
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,940
the open-faced
double decker blubber butt.

577
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,242
I won't ask what's in it.

578
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,645
I brought you something.

579
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,619
Peanut butter and jelly?
[sniffs]

580
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:37,656
Gee, nobody's ever made me
a sandwich. Heh-heh.

581
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,658
Hey, what do you want?

582
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,760
I need to call Stitch.

583
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,962
Sorry. Videophone's busted,

584
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,931
like everything else
in this dump.

585
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,834
- Can you fix it?
- Why should I?

586
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,637
Gantu's the only one who'd call,
and I ain't answerin'.

587
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,674
From now on, I'm lookin' out
for old number 625.

588
00:37:55,707 --> 00:38:00,646
625. I never gave you
a name, did I?

589
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,014
A name? For me?

590
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:06,017
Let's see.
How about Patty?

591
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,787
Short for patty melt.

592
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,191
Or... Monte?
Like a Monte Cristo?

593
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,161
Or Pita Pita Sandwich Eata.
[chuckles]

594
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:19,297
[sarcastic chuckle]
I don't think so.

595
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,667
I know! Reuben.

596
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,804
Huh. The classic corned beef
and sauerkraut on rye.

597
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,139
Reuben.
Ooh, I like that.

598
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:31,710
So, uh, does this give me
official "cousin" status?

599
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:34,946
You know, full ohana rights?
All that aloha stuff?

600
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,650
Depends. You have to give
aloha to get some back.

601
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,787
So, you're gonna help me
fix the videophone?

602
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,689
Sure. Why not?

603
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:47,192
It's Lilo, right?

604
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:49,861
[banging on metal]

605
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,964
- [clattering]
- [saw buzzing]

606
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,000
[air wrench whirring]

607
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,574
Uh, you sure
that's gonna work?

608
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:06,144
You'd be amazed. Pickle juice
is a great conductor.

609
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,180
[humming]

610
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:12,150
- You may thank me later.
- I'll thank you now.

611
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,520
Mahalo, Reuben.

612
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,221
Heh. No problem, Lilo.

613
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,903
[snarls]

614
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:40,111
- [Leroy laughs]
- [beeping]

615
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:43,615
Incoming call from...
E-arth, sir.

616
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:45,617
- [growls]
- [speaks gibberish]

617
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,786
It must be
the little Earth girl.

618
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:52,558
Ha-ha! My Leroy will easily
dupe her tiny little brain.

619
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:54,593
Hide!

620
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,635
Oooh!

621
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,807
Aloha, Stitch.

622
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,910
- Stitch?
- Uh...

623
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,813
- Say "eeh."
- Eeh.

624
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:18,884
- Are you OK?
- No, cuter.
Think "plush toy"!

625
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,821
Oh, yeah, it's me.
I'm Fluffy.

626
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,824
That's him,
all right.

627
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,731
Wait a minute.
My tiki necklace.

628
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,602
He's not wearing it.
That's not Stitch!

629
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:40,906
- Hang up. Hang up!
- OK! Bye-bye!

630
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,274
- Wait!
- [explosion]

631
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:50,516
Ah. I think that went
very well, don't you?

632
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,951
- Actually, sir, I think...
- I didn't ask what you think!

633
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:56,021
- Actually, you did. I...
- It was a rhetorical question!

634
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,757
Don't you know what
a rhetorical question is?

635
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,794
- Yes, sir! I believe it's...
- That was rhetorical too!

636
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:06,264
[groans] Aah!
[sighs]

637
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,035
My genius plan
is unfolding perfectly.

638
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,971
Prepare for hyperspace
to planet Turo,

639
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,206
where I and my army
of Leroys...

640
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,611
- [slurping]
- Quit picking your nose.

641
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:23,014
...shall take over the
stinky Galactic Alliance!

642
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:26,017
Sir, I must point out
a weak spot in your plan.

643
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,620
The little Earth girl
has a special talent

644
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,623
for turning evil experiments
from bad to good.

645
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:33,525
And she controls
a force of over 600

646
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,627
of Jumba's
genetic creations.

647
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:38,664
This makes her a credible
threat to your Leroy army.

648
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:41,800
Very well. Then the
little girl's experiments

649
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,637
must be captured and taken
to a large public arena,

650
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,839
where I shall
destroy them all!

651
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:49,575
[cackling]

652
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:53,211
This is clearly a job
for my most trusted henchman.

653
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,847
Thank you, sir. I won't
fail you this time.

654
00:41:55,881 --> 00:42:00,752
You have already failed me
625 times.

655
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:05,323
No, this time I will send
my new trusted henchman,

656
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:09,094
- Leroy!
- [growls]

657
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:14,532
[static]

658
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,868
Reuben,
there's a fake Stitch

659
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:19,037
driving
the Big Red Battleship.

660
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,172
Do you know
what that means?

661
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,074
It's lunchtime?

662
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,777
No. Stitch is in trouble,

663
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:28,580
and so is the Galactic Armada
and planet Turo

664
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:31,016
and maybe the whole galaxy!

665
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,752
It ain't our problem.

666
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,788
Look, you're number 625.

667
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,790
The closest one
to Stitch.

668
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:42,961
If you wanted to, you could
have all of his powers.

669
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,731
You just have to stop
making sandwiches

670
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:48,233
and start making
something of yourself.

671
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,869
- [sighs]
- I'm gonna fix this ship,

672
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,606
fly to planet Turo
and warn the Grand Councilwoman.

673
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,108
Are you with me?

674
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:02,047
I said,
are you with me?

675
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,751
I'm with you, sister,
but first we gotta
put this servo unit

676
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:07,653
back in the main
drive shaft.

677
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,788
You are as strong
as Stitch.

678
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:11,957
Now, we reroute
the ignition conduit...

679
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,792
And you can walk
on the ceiling.

680
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,227
[Reuben] Whoa-ohh!

681
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,664
I'm a little
out of practice.

682
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,834
Flazookie
and cartridge clamp.

683
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:24,836
- Here?
- Smaishy scoop.

684
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,972
- Is this it?
- Pickle.

685
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:29,941
- It's got a bite out of it.
- Perfect!

00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:13,785
And please, keep Weirdlo
and her weirdness

691
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,787
as far away from me
as possible.

that you wish to resign

Yes, please.

That being the case,
Mr. Gantu,

968
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:12,602
would you be interested
in resuming your position

969
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,671
as captain of
the Galactic Armada?

970
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,640
Would I?! Ahem.

I mean, yes,

I've grown rather fond
of your egg salad.

977
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:36,626
Granted. And finally,
Jumba and Pleakley.

978
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,197
Jumba would like to return
to Earth as well.

You would?
But what about your lab?

Jumba is finally
understanding

981
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:47,171
