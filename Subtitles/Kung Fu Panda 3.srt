2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh-ooh!

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,235
Stairs.

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,630
I don't think I can...

5
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,280
You guys,
just start without me.

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,792
I'll catch up!

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,832
Sweet.

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Ah.

9
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,593
Inner peace.

10
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,836
Itchy nose.

11
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,317
Finally, inner peace.

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Now what?

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,590
Kai, old friend.

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,588
Master Oogway.

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,917
Our battle ended
500 years ago!

16
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,675
Well, now I'm ready
for a rematch.

17
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,876
Took you long enough!

18
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,756
You've grown stronger.

19
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,830
500 years in the Spirit Realm,
you pick up a thing or two.

20
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,919
I have taken the chi
of every master here.

21
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
No!

22
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Yes.

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,318
And soon I will have
your power, too.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,391
When will you realize?

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,914
The more you take,
the less you have.

26
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,029
With your chi,

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,715
I will finally be able
to return to the mortal world.

28
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,913
And this time,
you won't be there to stop me.

29
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,753
It was never my destiny
to stop you.

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,992
I have set another
on that path.

31
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,276
Then I will find him,

32
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,040
and take his chi, too.

33
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,239
Justice is about to be served!

34
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,755
Whoo-hoo!

35
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,073
Yee-haw!

36
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,078
We'll have two Justice Platters,
please.

37
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Um... Three.
Three.

38
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
And a few tofu buns.

39
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,469
Oh, the spicy noodle
soup for Tigress.

40
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,754
Did you want extra
sauce with that?

41
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
She wants it
on the side.

42
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,558
On the side.
On the side.

43
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,312
Go, Dragon
Warrior! You can do it!

44
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,515
Go, Dragon Warrior!

45
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,715
Defend the Valley!

46
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,199
Dragon Warrior!

47
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,512
Go, Dragon Warrior!

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,511
Defend the Valley!

49
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,350
Yee-haw!

50
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,190
You guys aren't doing
the Dramatic Pose, are you?

51
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,590
Do we have to strike a pose
every time we land?

52
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,598
You guys, never underestimate

53
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,159
the power
of a Dramatic Entrance.

54
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,912
I've heard about some masters
who can win a fight

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,672
just by throwing open a door.

56
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,314
Oh!

57
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,628
Dramatic Entrance?

58
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Master Shifu.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,831
The Dragon Warrior is correct.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,513
Really? I was just making...

61
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,716
Uh, yeah. I mean, yeah. I am.

62
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,792
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

63
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,520
Hence, the Dramatic Entrance.

64
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,749
Oh!

65
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,877
Nice Dramatic Entrance.
What's the occasion?

66
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,713
Today will be
my final class.

67
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,399
Your final... Wait.

68
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,039
I didn't even know
you were sick!

69
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,230
Although you have been looking a little...
I'm not sick.

70
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,390
...healthy.
A little healthy. A lot, actually.

71
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,990
My final class,
because from now on,

72
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,310
your training will be
in the hands

73
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,152
of the Dragon Warrior.

74
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
What?

75
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,871
Me, teach?
I mean, why not, Tigress?

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,234
She's always telling
everyone what to do.

77
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Be quiet, Po.

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,549
You see what I mean?

79
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,312
Tigress is not
the Dragon Warrior.

80
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
You are.

81
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,438
Come on,
they're the Five.

82
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,158
What could I teach them?

83
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,949
There is always something more
to learn, even for a master.

84
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,235
For instance,

85
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,436
let me show you
another move,

86
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,916
the Dramatic Exit.

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,232
What's that?

88
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,637
Wow! Are you kidding me?

89
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,756
Where'd he go?

90
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Master.

91
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,797
He's gone, guys.
It's cool.

92
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,235
We await your
instruction, Master.

93
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,113
All you have to lose
is our respect.

94
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,278
I mean, seriously,
how bad can it be?

95
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,316
Very bad!
Very, very bad!

96
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,277
Okay, okay.
Let's switch it up.

97
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,237
Monkey!
Immovable Mountain Stance!

98
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,594
Yes, Master!

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,036
Tigress,
Tornado Back Flip!

100
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,235
Yes, Master.

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,319
Oh, no! Fire!

102
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
- Fire!
- Stop!

103
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,118
Sorry! My fault.

104
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,557
Crane, go high.
I mean low! Low!

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,153
Ah, my claw thingy!

106
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,918
Uh, Viper and Tigress, do,

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,992
uh, like, a Totem Pole
Poison Technique!

108
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,231
Uh, you two,
do a Swarming Insect Bite

109
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,671
with a Yellow Tail,
Yellow Jacket, Spicy Tuna...

110
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,193
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,789
Good job, Po.

112
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Ah!

113
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,755
Did you at least learn
a little something?

114
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,989
Yes.

115
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,798
That you can't teach.

116
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,235
And Tigress is flammable,
it turns out.

117
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,874
Yeah, that was
a complete disaster.

118
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,917
Uh, I'm glad
we're not Po right now.

119
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,115
What a loser!

120
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,514
What was Shifu thinking?

121
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,040
What was Oogway thinking?

122
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,790
I think he heard us.

123
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,632
I didn't hear
anything.

124
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,717
Uh, he said
you're a loser.

125
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,071
I'm sorry, Oogway.

126
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,589
Would you stop
doing that?

127
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,318
How was your
first day teaching?

128
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,833
Humiliating.

129
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
I heard.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,433
Who told you?
Did Tigress tell you?

131
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,670
I heard from Monkey,
and Crane, and Mantis,

132
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,912
and your dad,
and Mrs. Chao from the gift shop,

133
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,672
and those ducks
you just passed,

134
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
and Tigress told me.

135
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,277
Yeah, well, did she also tell you
that it'll never happen again?

136
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,429
Because I'm done.

137
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,590
Teaching or being humiliated?

138
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,513
Both! I don't know why you ever
thought I could teach that class.

139
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,319
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

140
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,438
What? You set me
up to fail? Why?

141
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,556
If you only do
what you can do,

142
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,393
you will never be
more than you are now.

143
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,308
I don't wanna be more!
I like who I am.

144
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,153
You don't even know
who you are.

145
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,719
What do you...
Of course I do.

146
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,438
I'm the Dragon Warrior.

147
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,353
And what exactly does
that mean, Dragon Warrior?

148
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,795
Hmm.

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,156
It means, you know,
just going around

150
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,559
and punching and kicking.

151
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,314
Defending the Valley!
And stuff.

152
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,919
Punching and kicking?

153
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,229
You think that is what

154
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,356
the great Master Oogway
saw for you?

155
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,309
A 500-year
prophecy fulfilled

156
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,960
so you could spend
your days kicking butt

157
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,839
and running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

158
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,873
Yes?
No!

159
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,634
Oogway saw greatness
in you, Po.

160
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,711
Against my better judgment.

161
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,678
More than you can see
in yourself.

162
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,553
Incredible power awaits you.

163
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,919
Power beyond anything
you can imagine.

164
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,516
Wow! What was that?

165
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,954
That was chi.

166
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,314
Wow!

167
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
What's chi?

168
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,636
The energy that flows
through all living things.

169
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,870
So you're saying
if I teach,

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,194
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that?

171
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,476
No. I'm saying
if you teach,

172
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,471
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that.

173
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Oh.

174
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,155
Mastering chi requires
mastery of self.

175
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,197
Oogway sat alone in a cave

176
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,955
for 30 years
asking one question.

177
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,913
"Who am I?"

178
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,839
"Who am I?"

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,752
I'm lucky if
I get five minutes

180
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
before you interrupt...

181
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,715
So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years?

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Eventually.

183
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,512
After you master teaching.

184
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,831
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,956
I'm not trying
to turn you into me.

186
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,312
I'm trying to
turn you into you.

187
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,273
Turn me into me?

188
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,560
Wait a second,
that makes no...

189
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,755
Almost there, Shifu.

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,117
Just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway.

191
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,033
Hmm... Oh! Uh...

192
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,918
Sorry, no offense,
Master Oogway. I just...

193
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,840
I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.

194
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,872
What is this place?

195
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,917
Uh... My brother's farm?

196
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Ah.

197
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,872
If I stepped on you,
would you die?

198
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Yes.

199
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,756
The mortal realm.

200
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,955
You hear that, Oogway?
I'm back.

201
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,433
Kai has returned!

202
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,715
Who?

203
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,838
Kai. General Kai.

204
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,158
Supreme Warlord of all China.

205
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,075
Huh?

206
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,391
The Jade Slayer.
Master of Pain.

207
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,349
You may know me as
the Beast of Vengeance.

208
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,277
Uh... Maker of Widows?

209
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Uh...

210
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,998
Okay, I used to
work with Oogway.

211
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,513
Oh, Master Oogway!

212
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,669
Now, he was a great warrior.

213
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,994
We've heard of
Master Oogway.

214
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,276
Okay, okay,
enough. Silence!

215
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,278
Find Oogway's students,
and bring them to me.

216
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,992
By the time I am done
with them, Oogway,

217
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,711
there will be no one left who
will even remember your name.

218
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,793
Kai is coming!

219
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,959
I am ready

220
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,554
to teach you a lesson.

221
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,029
Teach me? Oh, no!
It's the Dragon Teacher!

222
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,633
Yeah, he's so handsome!

223
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,960
Thank you for the compliment.

224
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,991
No! Please don't
teach me to death!

225
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Po?

226
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,311
Oh, hey, Dad.
What's up?

227
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,079
I was just, uh,
stopping by for a little soak.

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,069
Okay. What's wrong?

229
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Nothing.

230
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,878
Nothing? I come home

231
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,598
to find you taking
a bath with your dolls...

232
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Action figures.

233
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,916
...and instead of adding
bath salts to the water,

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,718
you just added
Szechuan peppercorns.

235
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Szechuan...

236
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,197
Oh, oh, my tenders! Oh...

237
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,079
Okay, yes,
something's wrong.

238
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,389
There, there, son.

239
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,272
You tell your daddy
all about it.

240
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,595
Lift your arm.

241
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,398
Shifu says I don't
know what it means

242
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,879
to be the Dragon Warrior.

243
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,190
Now I have to be a teacher?

244
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,799
I thought I finally
knew who I was.

245
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,190
If I'm not the Dragon Warrior,
then who am I?

246
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,715
A teacher?
Teaching kung fu?

247
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,870
Po, that's a promotion!

248
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,195
Take the job, son!

249
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,680
And, someday when
you're in charge

250
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,795
of the whole Jade Palace,

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,912
I can sell noodles
in the lobby!

252
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,440
Why are you still here
taking a bath like a baby?

253
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,635
Get out! Get up!

254
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,798
Go, go, go!
Franchise expansion awaits us!

255
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,040
But what about the Dragon
Warrior look-alike contest?

256
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,838
Oh, Mrs. Chow
always wins that.

257
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,799
Skadoosh.

258
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,190
And the Dragon Warrior
dumpling-eating contest?

259
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,349
I have to defend my title.

260
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,120
No one's gonna beat your
dumpling-eating record.

261
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,320
Someone's about to beat your
dumpling-eating record!

262
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,311
Go! Go!

263
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,799
Who's eating my dumplings?

264
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,234
And who's paying
for them?

265
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,229
101! 102!

266
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,196
103!

267
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,233
Yeah!

268
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,833
Is that a new record?

269
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,719
Who are you?

270
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,871
I am Li Shan.

271
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
What?

272
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,716
I'm Li Shan.

273
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,871
I'm looking for my son.

274
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,199
You lost your son?

275
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,594
Yes.

276
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,876
Many years ago.

277
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,033
I lost my father.

278
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,198
I'm very sorry.

279
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,555
Thank you.

280
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,834
Well, good luck to you.

281
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,913
You, too.

282
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,752
I hope you find your son.

283
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,589
And I hope you find
your father.

284
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,592
Son?

285
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,836
Oh, my gosh, it is you!

286
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,435
Well, don't just stand there.
Give your old man a hug!

287
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,596
I can't believe
you're alive!

288
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,869
Oh, I thought I lost
you forever, Little Lotus.

289
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,029
Uh...

290
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,758
Okay. Uh, this is
very embarrassing,

291
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,949
but I think you've
got me confused

292
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,115
with a panda named Lotus.

293
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,315
My name is Po.

294
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,710
Oh, right,
you wouldn't know.

295
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,672
Oh. Okay.
See, Little Lotus

296
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,836
was the name you
were given at birth.

297
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,433
Really?
Really!

298
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
I can't believe it!

299
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,477
After all these years,
you're really here?

300
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,113
This is amazing!

301
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,315
Oh, Dad!

302
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,271
Come! Say hi to, um...

303
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,908
I don't know what
I'm supposed to call you.

304
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,911
I'm pretty sure
he said his name is Li.

305
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,798
You.

306
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,439
Come here.

307
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,714
Oh...

308
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,358
Thank you, thank you

309
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,755
for taking such
good care of my son.

310
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,117
Your son?
Now, hold on just a minute.

311
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,989
How do we know this stranger
is even related to you?

312
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,479
Look at that.

313
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,949
Our bellies could be brothers!
That is so cool.

314
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,951
Hey, son, let me teach you
how to belly gong.

315
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,000
- All right. Belly gong.
- They jiggle the same!

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,877
It's like looking
in a fat mirror.

317
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,389
I can't believe we're
taking a picture together.

318
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,149
Huh?

319
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,471
But I still
don't understand.

320
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,551
I thought Po
was the only panda left.

321
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,518
No.
There's a whole bunch of us.

322
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,999
Where?

323
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,469
A secret panda
village in the mountains.

324
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,709
A secret panda...

325
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,751
Whoa.

326
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,478
But how did you know
where I was?

327
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,473
I received a message
that led me here.

328
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,392
How could you
receive a message

329
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,829
if no one
could find you?

330
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,268
Sounds suspicious to me.

331
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Hmm?

332
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,994
No, it was a message
from the universe.

333
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,195
Whoa!
Whoa.

334
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Rats!

335
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,557
Now, what's all
this about a Dragon Warrior?

336
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,637
How did you know
I was a Dragon Warrior?

337
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,312
Did the universe
tell you that, too?

338
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,669
No, the poster did.

339
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,875
And the gift shop.

340
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,673
I bought a tiny cup.

341
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,434
Oh, right, of course!

342
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,438
You have no idea.
There's so much to show you.

343
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
You're gonna be
so awesomely proud.

344
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,758
Come on, come on!

345
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,358
I'm already
awesomely proud.

346
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,716
- Couple more steps.
- Give me a minute.

347
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,280
Feeling the burn.

348
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,955
Do you have
panda asthma, too?

349
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,792
Does that run
in the family?

350
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,514
Dad, you're
gonna love this.

351
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,398
It's, like,
the coolest thing ever.

352
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,914
This is the Hall of Heroes.

353
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,229
Home of the most priceless

354
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,918
kung fu artifacts
in all of China!

355
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,038
Whoa! This place is...

356
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,360
Awesome?
Were you gonna say...

357
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,312
You were gonna say "awesome,"
right? Because it totally is!

358
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,516
Totally!
But be super careful.

359
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,635
Everything's very
fragile here.

360
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,512
Like the Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

361
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,113
Someone broke that once.

362
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,799
Who?
Some idiot.

363
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,473
Wow!

364
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,596
This is Master Flying
Rhino's battle armor!

365
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,115
I wonder if
I could fit in that.

366
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,475
Get out of my head, Dad!
I've wondered the same thing!

367
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
If I could fit in it?

368
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,199
If you could?
No, if I could fit.

369
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,077
Oh.
Dad, check it out!

370
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,995
Master Ram's crossbow,
the infamous Gate Smasher.

371
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Dad, look at this!

372
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,912
The battle helmets
of Master Rat's army.

373
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,319
They're so tiny!

374
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,512
Master Dolphin's
waterproof armor!

375
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,749
This is my favorite.

376
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,353
Check it out.
It's the legendary

377
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,953
battle rickshaw
of Emperor Hawk.

378
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,913
Sweet ride.

379
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Dad, what are
you doing?

380
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,720
We're not supposed
to touch anything!

381
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,473
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Should I put it back?

382
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,358
Yeah, you probably should.

383
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,476
You look so cool, though.

384
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,079
How does it feel?

385
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,430
Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?

386
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,272
Does it feel like
you're impenetrable?

387
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,640
Does it feel like you could
take on a thousand warriors,

388
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,320
and emerge unscathed?

389
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,313
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

390
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Ooh!

391
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,751
I wonder what this does.
I should pull it.

392
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,712
I think I just peed a little.

393
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,315
Anything else
we should try in here, son?

394
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Hmm?

395
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,669
Charge!

396
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,310
Faster, faster, faster!

397
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,674
Thumb war!

398
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,193
Reinforcements!
Ooh. Ooh.

399
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,918
No fair. No fair.

400
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Yeah!

401
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,832
This is so much fu...

402
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,879
Here we go! Go, go, go!

403
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,678
Awesome!
Faster, faster, faster.

404
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,353
There, there.

405
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,919
I'm fine, I'm fine.

406
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,514
There you go.

407
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,756
Dolphin-Style Attack!

408
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,075
You got me.
Dolphin-Style Retreat!

409
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,158
Go long, son!

410
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Whoa!

411
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,391
I wasn't ready!

412
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,192
Coming back at you.
I got it.

413
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,753
I'm going high!
There you go.

414
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,920
Come on, throw it!

415
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,553
I'm coming for you.

416
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,559
Bring it on, Master Rhino.

417
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Here I come!

418
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Oh!

419
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,717
I'm gonna get you.
I am gonna get you!

420
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,990
I'm gonna get you,
I'm gonna get you!

421
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,672
Psst. Psst. Psst
I'm gonna get you.

422
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,950
Who's got you?
Who's gonna get you?

423
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,918
Who's gonna get you?
Yeah. Who's gonna get you?

424
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,793
Master Rhino.

425
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,111
What? What's wrong?

426
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,433
Hello.

427
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Guys, guys.

428
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,236
You're never gonna guess
who just showed up.

429
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,197
Not in a million years.

430
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
You just try.

431
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,714
Your father!

432
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,472
Whoa! How did you
just guess that?

433
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,629
Oh, wait a second.
Oh, yeah, of course.

434
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
We look exactly the same.

435
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,638
Dad, say hi
to my friends.

436
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,110
Mantis, Tigress,
Monkey, Crane, and Viper.

437
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,315
Oh, Viper, was it?

438
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Monkey, sir.

439
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,795
They're kind of my best friends.
And this...

440
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,110
This is Master Shifu. Legend.

441
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,431
Uh... It is an honor
to meet you, Master Panda.

442
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,431
Perhaps your father
would care to join us

443
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,635
in the training hall.

444
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,677
Your son will be
teaching the class.

445
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,473
Oh, ho, ho!
I'm sure he's tired.

446
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,437
I'm sure you're tired.
He's tired.

447
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,794
I'm gonna show him
to the Chrysanthemum Suite.

448
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,871
What, tired?
No, I'm fine.

449
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,439
I would love
to watch you teach.

450
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,953
Trust me, it'll be more
fun just to watch me...

451
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,638
Fight!

452
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
What is that?

453
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,359
The Valley's under attack.

454
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,198
Son? Under attack?

455
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
This is perfect!

456
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,034
Now you can see what being the
Dragon Warrior's all about!

457
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Follow me!

458
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,950
Enemies of justice,
prepare for war!

459
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,678
Are you kidding me? Whoa!

460
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,315
Ow!

461
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,952
What's the deal
with the green guys?

462
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,948
Some kind of jade zombies.

463
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,553
Jade zombies?

464
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,312
Jombies! Jinx!

465
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Ow!

466
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,873
Lotus, be careful!

467
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,474
It's okay, Dad,
I do this every day!

468
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,358
Whoa! I recognize
these guys.

469
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,873
The Master Badger Twins,

470
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,712
with their Crushing
Double-Gong technique!

471
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,875
Ow!

472
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,678
Yeah, that's the one!

473
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,955
And that guy is...

474
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,031
No! Master Porcupine!

475
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,351
I thought he died
a hundred years ago.

476
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,317
These guys are legend!

477
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,711
Get a quick sketch of us.

478
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,233
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

479
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,039
Oh, I blinked.

480
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,800
Can we get another one?

481
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,669
I'm being choked
by Master Porcupine.

482
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,829
This is so cool.

483
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,398
Oh! Oh, look. It's you!

484
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,278
Po, focus!

485
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,079
"Message from the universe."

486
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,555
I'll give you a message
from the universe.

487
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,073
Stay away from my son!

488
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,600
Sorry, Dad.
I'll clean up later.

489
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,193
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not my good pan!

490
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,395
Uh, take this one.

491
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,074
Lotus! Watch out!

492
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Whoa!

493
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,192
Dad, check out
my Dumplings of Doom.

494
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Gotcha.

495
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,153
I see you.

496
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,474
<i>Your chi will soon be mine.</i>

497
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,675
Is he talking to me?
Which one?

498
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,795
They're all talking.

499
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,110
Whoa, you're right.
That's so scary.

500
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,271
We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd be scary back at them.

501
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,953
Okay, but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first.

502
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,633
Otherwise, it won't be scary.
It'll just be stupid.

503
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,149
<i>It's not them talking,
you idiots!</i>

504
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,833
<i>It's me talking
through them. Kai!</i>

505
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Who?

506
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,431
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

507
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,040
Did you see that?
What just happened?

508
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,509
The green smoke, just poof!
And then poof!

509
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,159
Shifu, what was that?

510
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,318
Kai... Kai... Kai...

511
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,318
Nope, never heard of him.

512
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,273
Kai... Kai...

513
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Where is it?

514
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,040
There's so much wisdom in here,
I can't find anything.

515
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,195
Yes!

516
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,198
Behold.

517
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,754
All the answers
will be found within.

518
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,110
What? It's blank?

519
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,633
Are you kidding me?
Not again.

520
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,037
Wait, wait, hold on. Sorry.

521
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,634
Oh, okay. Here we go.

522
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
It is written
in Oogway's hand.

523
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,395
"Long ago, I had a brother..."

524
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,953
Oogway had a brother?

525
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,476
"In arms. In arms." Sorry.
He says, "Brother-in-arms."

526
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,471
Maybe you should just
unroll it all at once?

527
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,070
"I was an ambitious young
warrior leading a great army."

528
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,839
<i>And fighting
by my side was Kai,</i>

529
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,996
<i>my closest friend.</i>

530
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,758
<i>One day, we were ambushed.</i>

531
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,876
<i>I was badly wounded.</i>

532
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,352
<i>My friend carried me for days,
looking for help,</i>

533
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,553
<i>until we came
to a secret village,</i>

534
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,676
<i>high in the mountains.</i>

535
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,593
<i>An ancient place of healing.</i>

536
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,638
<i>A village of pandas.</i>

537
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,358
Pandas?

538
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,511
<i>Yes, pandas.</i>

539
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,673
<i>Pandas who used
the power of chi to heal me.</i>

540
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,198
<i>They taught me
how to give chi.</i>

541
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,430
<i>Oh, but Kai wanted
the power all to himself.</i>

542
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,878
<i>He saw that what could be
given could also be taken.</i>

543
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,909
<i>I had to stop him.</i>

544
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,273
<i>Our battle shook the earth,</i>

545
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,271
<i>until, finally,</i>

546
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,750
<i>I banished Kai
to the Spirit Realm.</i>

547
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,559
<i>Should he ever return
to the mortal realm,</i>

548
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,918
<i>he can only be stopped
by a true master of chi.</i>

549
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,633
"True master of chi"?

550
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Like you!

551
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,718
Me? I can barely
make a flower bloom.

552
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,434
I need at least
30 more years, and a cave.

553
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,720
We need a chi master.

554
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,512
He will
continue stealing

555
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,480
the chi of masters
until he has consumed it all.

556
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,828
We have to think
of a way to stop him!

557
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,274
He'll get more
and more powerful

558
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,958
with every master he defeats.

559
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,600
There is
no choice. We fight.

560
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,392
I can teach you, son.

561
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,790
You can do this?

562
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,793
Of course. I'm a panda.

563
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,788
That must be why
the universe sent you here!

564
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,591
Okay, so what do I
have to do?

565
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,591
You have to
come home with me.

566
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
What?

567
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,319
To the secret village?

568
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Yes, son.

569
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,030
You must rediscover
what it is to be a panda.

570
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,395
You have to learn
to live like a panda,

571
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,993
sleep like a panda,

572
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,037
eat like a panda.

573
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,234
Those 103 dumplings?

574
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,276
I was just warming up.

575
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,192
I've always felt like
I wasn't eating up

576
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,673
to my full potential.

577
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,834
No, you can't take Po
away from me. No, no.

578
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,194
I want a second opinion.

579
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,715
Shifu, open another
scroll or something.

580
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,639
I think he should go.

581
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,279
Fine, a third opinion.

582
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,550
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?

583
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,393
Dad, you heard what
Shifu said Oogway said.

584
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,233
This guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

585
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,631
And I can only master chi
by knowing who I really am.

586
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,390
Well, I'm a panda.

587
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,516
I'll pack you a lunch
for the road.

588
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,873
Do you really think
Po can master chi in time?

589
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,712
Doesn't matter
what I think.

590
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,717
It only matters
what the universe thinks.

591
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,757
So, that's a "no"?

592
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,558
Master, what are
we going to do?

593
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,676
You are going to find
out where Kai is.

594
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,440
Follow the trail
of those jade creatures.

595
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,154
But do not engage,

596
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,716
for with every foe he faces,
Kai becomes stronger.

597
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,871
Why me? Is it
because I asked?

598
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,554
No. It is because
you can fly. Go!

599
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,556
Should have kept
your beak shut.

600
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,835
And take Mantis.

601
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,080
Oh, man. Is it
because I...

602
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,309
Yes.

603
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,355
Oh! Lunch break.

604
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Oh.

605
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,999
You don't need
to ask me twice.

606
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,877
Dad?

607
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,632
Yes?
Dad?

608
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Yes?

609
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,075
What are you doing here?

610
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,708
What am I doing?
Getting a backache.

611
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,791
Did you have to step
on every rock?

612
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,752
No, I mean,
why are you here?

613
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,473
What was I supposed
to do, huh?

614
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,716
What if the pandas
don't have food you like?

615
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,717
You're never gonna be able
to save the world

616
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,432
on an empty stomach.

617
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,114
I consider my presence
mission critical.

618
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,633
Oh... Yes, about that...

619
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,634
We can't share the location of
the village with others. So...

620
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,792
Well, you think I can't
keep a secret, huh?

621
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,951
I raised Po for 20 years

622
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,196
before I finally
told him he was adopted.

623
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,157
Seriously?
Yeah.

624
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,432
Okay. I guess it would be
cruel to make you fly back.

625
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,758
You can fly?

626
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,273
I'm a bird, Po.

627
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
We're here.

628
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,672
Sure looks like a long
ways up there.

629
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,671
And my son hates stairs.

630
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,273
So, let's go home.

631
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,948
We're pandas.
We don't do stairs.

632
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,031
I've waited my whole life
to hear those words.

633
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,195
Rats.

634
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,476
Whoa... Huh?

635
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,880
This is the secret
panda village?

636
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,076
No wonder
you keep it a secret.

637
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,038
If I lived here,
I wouldn't tell anyone either.

638
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,392
Now you can "Whoa."

639
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,154
Whoa!

640
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
Let's go!

641
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,760
Over here! Come on!

642
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,232
Look over there!

643
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Oh...

644
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,351
My turn! My turn!
Come on, faster, faster!

645
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Li?

646
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,072
Everyone! Li's back!

647
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,310
They're both back!
He found his son!

648
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,475
He made it!
They're back!

649
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,238
Li?
He found his son!

650
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,038
Everyone! Li's back!

651
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,151
Hang on, we're coming!

652
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,117
He made it!
Whoo-hoo!

653
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,952
They made it!
Why are we running?

654
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,991
- Here we come!
- He's back!

655
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,752
They made it!

656
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,076
Li Shan is back!

657
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
Hi!

658
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,155
Everyone!

659
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,635
Everyone, gather around!
This is my son!

660
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,915
Hello, hi.
He's here!

661
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,479
You're here!
Triplets!

662
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,959
Hi, I'm Ku Ku!

663
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,109
I'm Meng Meng.
I'm Shuai Shuai.

664
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,918
Your fur is soft.
He smells like cookies.

665
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,629
He's so handsome,
just like his father.

666
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Thank you.

667
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,951
Son, these are
your cousins.

668
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,758
Dim and Sum.

669
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
I have cousins!

670
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Welcome!
Welcome!

671
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,639
Whoa! Buns on a string.

672
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,835
We call it a snacklace.

673
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,320
That's right.

674
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,352
Uh... We'll make
you another one.

675
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,549
Oh!

676
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,675
It's you!

677
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,474
So... That's nice. Yeah, hi!

678
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,471
I don't know who you are.

679
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,995
Oh, Stripy Baby. So beautiful.

680
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,280
Oh! Okay, careful with that.
That's my action figure.

681
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,436
Can I keep her?
Can I? No...

682
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,269
Problem. Of course.

683
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,640
Yeah.
That's why I brought her.

684
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,789
Take good care of her.

685
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,269
Yes! Stripy Baby.

686
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,155
You look just like me,
but a baby.

687
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,792
You're like me, but old.

688
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,838
You're like me, but fatter!

689
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,797
You're like me, but

690
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,229
with a hat.

691
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,198
He does wear a hat!

692
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,032
You all look like me.

693
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,040
Let's feast in
my son's honor.

694
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
What the...

695
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,989
Pandas don't walk. We roll!

696
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,435
Have you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous?

697
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,077
Po, what are
you doing? Po!

698
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,230
Ohh! Ow!

699
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,876
You're right,
that is better than walking.

700
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,117
Mmm!

701
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,988
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

702
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,160
Have some dumplings.

703
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,509
What kind of panda
doesn't know how to roll?

704
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,194
Well, I'm kind of new at this
whole "being a panda" thing.

705
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,839
Hey, what kind
of panda are you?

706
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,399
You have a funny neck.

707
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,555
I'm not a panda at all.

708
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,919
What's that? What's that?
My hat. My beak.

709
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
What's that?
My wing.

710
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,718
What's that?
My dumplings.

711
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,916
No more questions!
Go away, kid.

712
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,718
Here, son. I packed
your chopsticks.

713
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
- Thanks, Dad.
- Wow.

714
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Oh, my.

715
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,080
What?

716
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,755
What are those for?

717
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,000
These? These
are chopsticks.

718
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,069
They're for picking
up dumplings.

719
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,959
You mean you only eat
one at a time?

720
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,915
Yummy.

721
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,269
Yeah, yummy.

722
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,954
I knew I wasn't eating
up to my potential!

723
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,595
Huh?

724
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,915
I am Mei Mei.

725
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,516
Wow, she's amazing.
She's so beautiful.

726
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,908
That's sweet, Po.

727
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,469
But please, try to save
all other compliments

728
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,477
until after the performance.

729
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,353
Me? No, I didn't say...

730
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,432
Shut it.

731
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,158
After the performance.

732
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,311
Huh! Has it
started yet?

733
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,755
Best ribbon dancer
in the world!

734
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,279
At least,
that's what she said.

735
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,998
Look away. Look away.

736
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,310
No. You can't, can you?

737
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,994
Dad, why does she
keep staring at me like

738
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
that!

739
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Try to keep up.

740
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,872
I don't really know
how to dance!

741
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,112
Of course you do.
All pandas dance.

742
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,195
I know what you were thinking.
You do?

743
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,550
"How can one
panda be so beautiful?"

744
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,316
For me? Oh!

745
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,833
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

746
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,995
Po.

747
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,156
Help me, Dads.
Yeah, no, you're on your own.

748
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,548
You're doing
great, son.

749
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,028
Your turn.

750
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,719
Oh!

751
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Huh?

752
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,758
Yay, Po!

753
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,555
Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of it.

754
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,992
I have so much to learn.

755
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,676
Wings of Surveillance!

756
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,398
Why do you do that?
Do what?

757
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,198
Just because you say
"Wings of" before something,

758
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,998
it doesn't mean that you're
doing a special move.

759
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,395
It's like me saying
"Antenna of Power"

760
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,717
or "Thorax of
Making Sandwiches."

761
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,194
Wings of Disagreement.

762
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,588
Whoa! There.

763
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,315
Master Bear,
Master Chicken, Master Croc!

764
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,594
What are you doing out here?

765
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,438
Jade creatures
attacked our villages.

766
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,709
We've tracked them here.

767
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,393
Stop!

768
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,070
They must be in there.

769
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,198
Master Shifu strongly
advised us

770
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,788
not to engage.

771
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,473
We've gotta get in there.
But Master Shifu said...

772
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,709
You're seriously afraid?

773
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,758
Even Master Chicken's going
in there! And he's a chicken.

774
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,116
That's it.
I'm going in.

775
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,310
Mantis! We have orders not to...
They need our help!

776
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,351
Come on.
I'll go high, you go low.

777
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,475
No, wait.

778
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,639
Fear the bug!

779
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,319
All right, you little...

780
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Uh-oh!

781
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,675
Hold on, buddy. I'm coming!

782
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,229
Antenna of Power!
Ah! It didn't work!

783
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,435
Mantis!

784
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,594
Mantis?

785
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,756
Mantis.

786
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,631
Your chi is strong.

787
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,639
Just like your friend,

788
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,789
the bug.

789
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,793
Mantis.

790
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,038
Don't worry, little birdie.

791
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,035
I'll put your chi
to good use,

792
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,037
destroying the Jade Palace
and everyone in it.

793
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,389
No!

794
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,351
Wings of Regret!

795
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,354
Hmm. Oh, yeah.

796
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,839
First day of panda training!

797
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,598
All right, flower.

798
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,069
I'm gonna make you bloom.

799
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,872
Whoo-hoo!

800
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,149
Dad. Dad.

801
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,355
What? What? What is it?

802
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,280
I'm ready for my first day
of panda training.

803
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,469
What?
You know, learn to be

804
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,516
a panda, master chi,
save the world!

805
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,836
Pandas sleep
till past noon.

806
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,833
So lesson
number one is, "Go back to bed."

807
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,231
Oh! Of course!

808
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,876
Nobody said this was
gonna be easy.

809
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,033
Did I oversleep?

810
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
You sure did.

811
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Yes!

812
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Yeah! Show him, kids!

813
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,517
Can you do this?
Can you do that?

814
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,880
How about this?
How about that?

815
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,758
Am I doing it?
Is this good? Whoa!

816
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,518
I got it! Ka-blam!

817
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Whoa!

818
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,760
Grandma Panda, heads up!
Hello! Ow!

819
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Oh.
Uh-oh.

820
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,191
We better roll.

821
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,510
Po, lunch time.

822
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,953
Oh!

823
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,189
Po?

824
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,635
You gotta let the hill
tell you where to roll.

825
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,113
Oh! Rookie mistake.

826
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,636
Dim, Sum, let's show him
how we go uphill!

827
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,432
Whoo-hoo!

828
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,913
It's beautiful.

829
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,274
Snack time. Po!

830
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,634
Whoo-hoo!

831
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,113
You can fly?

832
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,554
I'm coming in hot!

833
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,111
Get them while
they're cold. Hmm.

834
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,469
What are you doing there?

835
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,232
That food is for Po!

836
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
Throw it in!

837
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,753
There, there. That's it.

838
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,956
Feeling relaxed?
Totally.

839
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,275
Just let yourself
fall into it.

840
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
Got it.

841
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,519
I'm fine. I just...

842
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,074
There we go.
Just let it all out.

843
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,639
That's my boy.

844
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,840
Get out of there!

845
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,674
Oh! My noodles!

846
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,074
Leave my noodles alone.

847
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,912
Subtle, Po. Very subtle.

848
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,473
Let me get some of that.

849
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,154
Oh!

850
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,879
Hey, leave my hat alone!

851
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,837
We love noodles!

852
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,035
More noodles!

853
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,679
Oh! Just like my Po.

854
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,880
What are you guys looking at?

855
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,712
That's how we roll!
Cannonball!

856
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,833
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

857
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,673
Here, bring it up here.

858
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,193
Mom, look it!
Whoa!

859
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,194
How was that?

860
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,673
Whoa!

861
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,037
Now, you try again.
But don't try so hard.

862
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,269
Okay. Okay.

863
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,551
Much better.

864
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,549
Thanks, Dad.

865
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,229
For what?

866
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,311
You know, just for,
you know,

867
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,231
showing me
what it feels like

868
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,519
to be a panda.

869
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,670
So, when do you think
I'll be ready? Ready?

870
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,392
You know, to learn
how to master chi.

871
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,071
Soon. Real soon.

872
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,160
Come on, I wanna
show you something else.

873
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,349
Come on.

874
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,230
Sorry about the mess.
I don't usually get visitors.

875
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,633
Is this my mom?

876
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,551
I had this done
on your 100th day.

877
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Hmm.

878
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,230
Your momma couldn't
hold you still.

879
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,439
You nearly ate
the paper.

880
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,429
It's true.

881
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,828
What was she like?

882
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
Oh!

883
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,957
She was the total package.

884
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,276
Smart, beautiful,

885
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,595
tremendous appetite.

886
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,631
She was the love
of my life.

887
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,199
And then, just when I thought
I couldn't get any luckier,

888
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,909
along you came.

889
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,634
My Little Lotus.

890
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,677
I really had it all,

891
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,478
until that one moment,

892
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,152
when I lost everything.

893
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,878
Dad.

894
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,032
You don't have to worry about
losing me ever again.

895
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,194
Okay?

896
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,878
Let me get
some of that.

897
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,555
It's from
the Eastern Province!

898
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,914
Master Lizard, Master Ox,
Master Eagle. All of them.

899
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,597
In every village
from the sea to here,

900
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,558
every master in China,

901
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,760
has vanished.

902
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,154
Maybe they are
all at a party.

903
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,275
Monkey.

904
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,549
I didn't get
invited either.

905
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,751
Kai has taken their chi.

906
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,388
We are all that stand
between him,

907
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,434
and the knowledge
Oogway left in our care.

908
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,552
The villagers, evacuated?

909
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,720
Done, Master.

910
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,080
Crane, Mantis?

911
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,120
Still nothing.

912
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,639
Wait. It's them!

913
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,080
No!

914
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,440
Kai.

915
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,634
Nice.

916
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,389
Very tacky.

917
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,074
How dare you set foot
on these grounds!

918
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,629
Look at you pathetic fools.

919
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,839
Groveling at the feet
of Oogway the Magnificent.

920
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,150
You are not fit
to speak his name.

921
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,954
I am not fit, little kitten?

922
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,950
I fought by his side.

923
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,948
I loved him like a brother.

924
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,789
And he betrayed me.

925
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,834
Now I will destroy
everything he has created!

926
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Go!

927
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,233
How's that
for a little kitten?

928
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,717
I will not let you
destroy Oogway's memory.

929
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,235
Why not? He destroyed mine.

930
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,589
Mantis.

931
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,711
It is me, your bestie!

932
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,308
Sorry, Tigress!

933
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,080
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

934
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Sorry!

935
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,075
Shifu.

936
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,714
Bring them to me.

937
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,275
No.

938
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,515
You must warn Po.

939
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Master, please.

940
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,759
I will show you the true
power of chi, brother.

941
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,115
No.

942
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,351
Oogway, forgive me.

943
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,752
Hmm. What do
you say, Oogway?

944
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,592
Do you forgive him?

945
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,749
You may have destroyed
the Jade Palace,

946
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,639
but you will never succeed.

947
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,634
There will always
be someone to stop you.

948
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,631
Who? The panda?

949
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,831
His chi is strong,

950
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,635
but it won't be enough.

951
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,633
He will meet
the same fate as you.

952
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,835
No.

953
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,158
And so will every panda
in that village.

954
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,793
Yes.

955
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,675
Po, I hope
you're ready.

956
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,278
Dance, Lotus. Dance.

957
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,032
He's so handsome.

958
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,348
Ooh!

959
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,749
Hi!

960
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,753
That's a panda hug!

961
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,158
Hey.

962
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,360
Po.

963
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,400
Tigress?

964
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,879
Who's she?

965
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,189
Who is that?

966
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,359
Big Stripy Baby!

967
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,080
What are you
doing here?

968
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,912
Kai attacked the Valley.

969
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,433
He's taken every
master in China,

970
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,760
including Shifu
and the others.

971
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,752
It's all gone, Po.
Everything. Everyone.

972
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
Everyone?

973
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,080
Everyone.

974
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,431
How's my restaurant?

975
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,279
We'll talk later.

976
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,759
And now he's on his way here.

977
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,433
He's after you, Po.

978
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,355
He's after all pandas.

979
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,668
How long do we have?

980
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,760
Not long.

981
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,876
Please, tell me
you've mastered chi.

982
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,360
Here, take the baby.
Dad! Dad!

983
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,600
Okay, who belongs
to this one?

984
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,680
You need to teach me
the secret chi technique now!

985
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,910
No, no, I'm afraid
you need more time.

986
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,238
Everyone, go get your things!
Let me help you with that.

987
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,072
I don't have more time.
I need to learn it now!

988
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,071
Sorry, you're not ready.

989
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,389
Okay, pack everything!

990
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,079
- I am ready.
- Not quite.

991
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,630
What are you talking about?
I've done everything you've asked.

992
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,273
I've mastered napping,
sleeping in,

993
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,714
hammocks, hot tubs.

994
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,791
I am totally at one
with my panda parts.

995
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,955
Now why won't
you show me?

996
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,236
Because I don't know it!

997
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,480
You what?

998
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,869
I don't know it, okay?
No one does.

999
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,149
Maybe we used to.

1000
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,473
But not anymore.

1001
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,995
You lied?

1002
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,433
No, I...

1003
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,473
Yes.

1004
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,631
Wh... Why?

1005
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,398
To save your life!

1006
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,996
I find out some blade-swinging
maniac is coming for you.

1007
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,232
What am I supposed to do?
Just let that happen?

1008
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,837
Yes! I'm the Dragon Warrior.
Facing maniacs, that's my job!

1009
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,356
But because of you,
I left the Valley unprotected.

1010
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,238
I left my friends unprotected!

1011
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,793
And now they're all...

1012
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,360
They're all...

1013
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,277
And you would have been, too.

1014
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,750
I lost you once.

1015
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,309
I am not going
to lose you again.

1016
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,111
I can't.

1017
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,359
You just did.

1018
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,199
Mom! Pick me!

1019
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,400
Oh!

1020
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,118
Po, I'm so worried for you

1021
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,834
that I can't even enjoy
being right about everything.

1022
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,798
Now run, run, run, as fast
as those chubby legs can go!

1023
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,359
Run? There's
nowhere to run.

1024
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,158
But what are
you going to do?

1025
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,073
I'm gonna stay,
and fight that monster.

1026
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,516
Po, he may be a monster,
but he's still your father.

1027
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,193
Not him. Kai!

1028
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,078
No!

1029
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,229
Hungry?

1030
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,436
No, I... Not really.

1031
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,792
Well, maybe just one.

1032
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,553
You know, you weren't
the only one who was lying.

1033
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,640
Oh?

1034
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,034
I didn't really come along

1035
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,192
because I was worried Po
would go hungry.

1036
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,872
I was worried about you.

1037
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,799
Worried that I'd go hungry?

1038
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,109
No.

1039
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,709
I was worried
you'd steal Po from me.

1040
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,800
I'd what?

1041
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,599
I know. That was crazy.

1042
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,470
But I realize having you

1043
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,910
in Po's life doesn't
mean less for me.

1044
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,310
It means more for Po.

1045
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,988
Oh.

1046
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,837
Well, I'm not in his life.

1047
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,228
Not anymore.

1048
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,834
Your son got mad at you.

1049
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,319
Welcome to parenthood.

1050
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,517
You don't understand.
I lied to him.

1051
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,473
He'll never forgive me.

1052
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,915
I lied to him for 20 years.

1053
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,150
He still thinks
he came from an egg.

1054
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,516
Sometimes, we do the wrong
things for the right reasons.

1055
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,640
Look.

1056
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,352
He's hurt.

1057
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,033
He's confused.

1058
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,758
And he still has
to save the world.

1059
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,838
He needs both his dads.

1060
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,793
This isn't going to work.

1061
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,960
It has to.

1062
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,109
You're not
thinking straight.

1063
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,514
I am!
You're not.

1064
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,680
I am!
No.

1065
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,840
Yes, I am.
No.

1066
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,718
I've seen Kai.

1067
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,518
I've seen what he can do.

1068
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,796
But he hasn't seen
what I can do.

1069
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,199
The Wuxi Finger Hold?

1070
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,920
It's my best move.

1071
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,399
I just have to get to Kai,

1072
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,840
grab his finger
and then skadoosh!

1073
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,478
Back to the Spirit Realm.

1074
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,357
He has an army
of jade warriors.

1075
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,317
Everything they see,
he sees.

1076
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,913
So there's no
sneaking up on him.

1077
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,080
You will never get

1078
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,832
close enough.
It's gonna work!

1079
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,833
He can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

1080
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,120
Oh, you sound just like Shifu
with the, "Chi, chi, chi."

1081
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,031
"Chi this. Chi that."
"Chi, chi, chi!"

1082
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,350
I'm not a master
of chi, okay?

1083
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,839
I don't know if I'm
the Dragon Warrior.

1084
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,433
I don't even know
if I'm a panda!

1085
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,033
I don't know who I am!

1086
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,840
You're right.

1087
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,070
There's no way I can
stop him and his army.

1088
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,954
Unless you had
an army of your own.

1089
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,280
You?

1090
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,392
Not just me.

1091
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,959
Us.

1092
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,394
All of us.

1093
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,553
I finally found my son,
after all these years.

1094
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,748
It's going to take a lot more
than the end of the world

1095
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,955
to keep us apart.

1096
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,076
But you don't
even know kung fu.

1097
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,555
Then you will teach us.

1098
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,314
What? I can't
teach you kung fu.

1099
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,554
I couldn't even teach Tigress.
And she already knows kung fu!

1100
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,075
Po, I know I'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now.

1101
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,319
But you gotta believe me.

1102
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,118
We can do this.

1103
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,236
We can learn kung fu.

1104
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,994
We can be just like you!

1105
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,080
What did you just say?
Uh...

1106
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,679
"We can do this"?
No!

1107
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,833
"We can learn kung fu"?
After that!

1108
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,473
Uh... "We can be
just like you"?

1109
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,959
Yes!
We can?

1110
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,678
No! You can't!

1111
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,513
But you don't have to be!

1112
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,119
That's what Shifu meant.

1113
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,838
I don't have to
turn you into me.

1114
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,353
I have to turn you into you!

1115
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,112
That doesn't
make any sense.

1116
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,111
I know!

1117
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,594
Thanks, Dads.

1118
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,034
You're welcome?

1119
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,158
I'm gonna do something I never
thought I'd be able to do.

1120
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,515
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

1121
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,034
You guys, your real strength
comes from being

1122
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,200
the best "you" you can be.

1123
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,554
So who are you?

1124
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,039
<i>What are you good at?</i>

1125
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,553
<i>What do you love?</i>

1126
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,789
<i>What makes you, "you"?</i>

1127
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,995
Whoo-hoo!

1128
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,630
Yes, good. Good. Again.

1129
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,868
Good. Again.

1130
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,392
Good, good, good. Again.

1131
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,190
Stripy Baby! Stripy Baby!

1132
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,994
Faster, faster!
Twirl those ribbons!

1133
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,388
Hug that log, you!

1134
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,152
Hug that log
like it's the last time

1135
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,071
you're ever gonna hug it
goodbye forever.

1136
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,912
Higher! And a little more
to the left this time.

1137
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,040
You can do it!

1138
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,638
Whoo-hoo!

1139
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,159
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1140
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,674
I don't wanna see any of
these hit the ground!

1141
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,996
Wait, wait, Stripy Baby!

1142
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,555
Good! Try it with this.

1143
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,749
Now try it with these!

1144
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,910
Good! Now try
it with these.

1145
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,759
Oh! Oh!

1146
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,599
Whoo!

1147
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,039
They are ready.

1148
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,193
What?

1149
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,795
Okay, pay attention because
I'm only gonna go over this

1150
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,148
10 more times.

1151
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,073
The only entrance
to the village is here.

1152
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,549
The dumpling squadron
will take position here,

1153
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,234
while the cookie squadron
will take position here.

1154
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,834
Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...

1155
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,759
Right, okay.

1156
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,672
The noodle squadron will...

1157
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,990
Okay. Anyway,
the important thing to remember

1158
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,513
is that this
is the spot where...

1159
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,158
Okay, I saw that coming.

1160
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,839
If you only remember
one thing,

1161
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,313
it's distract the jombies

1162
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,313
until I get close enough to
put a Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai.

1163
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,993
- You got it?
- Yeah!

1164
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,350
Pandas on three!
One, two three, Pan...

1165
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,956
You guys... Never mind,
I'll teach you that later.

1166
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,392
I wish I could have
taught you this, son.

1167
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,312
It's okay, Dad. I'm...

1168
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,558
He's here.

1169
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,831
Wow!

1170
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,589
That's what I call
a Dramatic Entrance!

1171
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,554
Ha-ha! You must be
the Dragon Warrior.

1172
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,359
And you must be Kai!

1173
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,954
Beast of Vengeance,
Maker of Widows!

1174
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,430
Yes! Finally! Thank you!

1175
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,437
Almost makes me wanna
spare your life.

1176
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,959
Oh, you wanna spare me?

1177
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,270
How about you spare me
the chit-chat?

1178
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,231
All right? Let's do this.

1179
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,396
I'm going to take your chi,

1180
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,199
then the chi
of every panda in the...

1181
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,469
Oh! Chit-chat!

1182
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,073
In this...
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1183
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,554
In...
Chat, chat, chat.

1184
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,548
In the...
Chit-chat!

1185
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,313
Oh, you pudgy little...

1186
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,597
Round them all up.

1187
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,316
Oh, no. It's true.

1188
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,436
You guys have all been
turned green!

1189
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,518
Except for you, Mantis.
You were already green.

1190
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,794
Now?
Wait for the signal.

1191
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,595
Here we go!

1192
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,635
Dumpling Squad!

1193
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,518
Ready?
Go time!

1194
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,352
Belly!
Gong!

1195
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,520
Whoo!

1196
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,040
Seriously?

1197
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,360
Yeah! Whoo!
We did it! Whoo-hoo!

1198
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,588
Sorry, Crane.

1199
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,200
Spring Roll Squad!
Time for some takeout!

1200
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,712
Yoo-hoo!

1201
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,553
Over here, Mr. Jombie!

1202
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,197
I don't know who
you are, either.

1203
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,560
Noodle Squad!

1204
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,798
Get ready to dance

1205
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,479
with danger!

1206
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,754
Oh, sweet!

1207
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,749
Stripy Baby!

1208
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,920
Oh.

1209
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,040
Whee!

1210
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,038
Do it.
You're mean!

1211
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,194
Fire!

1212
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,955
Fire in the hole!

1213
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,189
Oh!

1214
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,509
Yes!

1215
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,272
All right, kids!

1216
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,793
You got it, guys!

1217
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,879
Oh, no! Master Shifu!

1218
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,720
I can't hit Shifu!

1219
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,955
I can!

1220
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,792
And so can I.

1221
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,113
Double-Dad Defense!

1222
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,549
Left, Dad!
Right, Dad!

1223
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,720
Thanks, Dad!

1224
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,074
Back at you, Dad.

1225
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,793
We've got this, son!

1226
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,709
Go, Dads!

1227
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,880
Yeah!

1228
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,799
Yeah!

1229
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,989
We got them now.

1230
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,992
Stop. Stop! Enough!

1231
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,275
Get out...

1232
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,799
Let's finish this.

1233
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
That's our boy!

1234
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,512
Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you
back to the Spirit Realm.

1235
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,749
Skadoosh!

1236
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,752
Okay, that didn't work.
Let me try one more time.

1237
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,515
Skadoosh! Skadoosh. Skadoosh.
Skadoo... What the...

1238
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,591
Hold on, wait!
It's working.

1239
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,671
No. No!

1240
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,596
No, it's not.

1241
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,438
Did Oogway teach you
that little trick?

1242
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,314
Too bad.

1243
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,550
It only works on mortals.

1244
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,474
And I am a Spirit Warrior.

1245
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,629
Come!

1246
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,675
Whoa!

1247
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,434
Son!

1248
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,909
Po!

1249
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,554
I was wrong.

1250
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,188
I'm sorry. Run. Run!

1251
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,233
So, Oogway,

1252
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,188
this was the one
destined to stop me?

1253
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,510
I will have his chi,

1254
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,269
and then all of theirs!

1255
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,154
And you...

1256
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,234
You really thought you could send
me back to the Spirit Realm?

1257
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,396
You are just a stupid mortal.

1258
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,631
It only works on mortals.

1259
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,236
You're right.
I can't send you there.

1260
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,994
But I can take you there.

1261
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,720
What's that?

1262
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,229
What?

1263
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,993
Po!
Son!

1264
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,119
Skadoosh.

1265
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,508
Son!

1266
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,275
No!

1267
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,714
What happened?

1268
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,880
Where's Po?

1269
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,636
He took Kai away.
He saved us.

1270
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,949
No.

1271
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,717
He saved us,
but who's saving him?

1272
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,633
Whoa!

1273
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,995
The Spirit Realm. It worked!

1274
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,360
Get off me, you...

1275
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,394
You brought me back?

1276
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,474
Don't blame me. I tried to finish
this in the regular realm.

1277
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,710
Then we'll finish it here!

1278
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,720
Whoa!

1279
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,631
Come on, son. Fight!

1280
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,278
We have to help him.

1281
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,069
We have to help him!

1282
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,400
Okay. Everyone gather around.

1283
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,635
That's it. Come in close.
Come on.

1284
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,478
We can do this.

1285
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,554
Po...

1286
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,951
You taught us who
we were meant to be.

1287
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,710
A father.

1288
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,839
A friend.

1289
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,634
A dumpling kicker.

1290
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,358
A lethal fighting machine.

1291
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,748
A hugger.

1292
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,597
A nunchuck chick.

1293
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,916
Stripy Baby.

1294
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,439
A family.

1295
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,474
Sweet!

1296
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,718
Whoa.

1297
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,434
Who are you?

1298
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,989
I've been asking
the same question.

1299
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,278
Am I the son of a panda?

1300
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,198
The son of a goose?

1301
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,429
A student?

1302
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,594
A teacher?

1303
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,279
Turns out,

1304
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,115
I'm all of them.

1305
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,475
I am the Dragon Warrior.

1306
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,595
Get it? See the giant dragon?

1307
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,311
Get ready to feel the thunder.

1308
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,558
This is awesome!

1309
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,597
Whoo-hoo!

1310
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,360
Hmm.

1311
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,840
Uh-oh.

1312
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,640
Belly Gong.

1313
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,514
Butt Slap.

1314
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,715
Perhaps a bit of lunch.

1315
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:30,989
Because I'm starving.

1316
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,960
Mmm.

1317
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:51,840
Let's do this!

1318
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,560
Heads up!

1319
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,479
It took me 500 years
to take Oogway's chi.

1320
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,076
I will have yours
if it takes me 500 more.

1321
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,355
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1322
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,238
Chit-chat.

1323
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,911
You want my chi so bad,

1324
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,469
then take it.

1325
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,839
Yes.

1326
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,594
The power is mine.

1327
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,628
Wait. No. It's too much.

1328
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,030
That's too much! No!

1329
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,718
No!

1330
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,520
Oh!

1331
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,158
Where did he go?

1332
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,714
Oh!

1333
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,272
We're back!

1334
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Bestie!

1335
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,032
I'm still green!
It didn't work!

1336
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,037
Oh, wait.
That's my normal green.

1337
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,519
Greeny Baby!

1338
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,796
Not a baby.
Not a baby!

1339
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,228
Antenna of Fear!

1340
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,079
What about Po?

1341
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,160
Have you seen Po?

1342
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,918
No. He's not here?

1343
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,989
Po? Po?

1344
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,037
Why isn't he back?

1345
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,271
Dragon Warrior.

1346
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,596
Oogway? Whoa!

1347
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,112
I can't believe it.

1348
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,639
Whoa!

1349
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,233
You are extra shiny.

1350
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,400
As are you.

1351
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,357
I know, right?
It's like the best cape ever.

1352
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,670
When I run with it,
then it looks really cool.

1353
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,035
It suits you.
You've grown.

1354
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,111
Yep. I gotta lay off
the panda buffet.

1355
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,350
Grown up,

1356
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,553
as I hoped you would

1357
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,279
when I sent the message
to your father.

1358
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,591
You sent
the universe mail. Whoa!

1359
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,800
Yes.

1360
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,993
Because the universe
needed you.

1361
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,037
Me?

1362
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,877
You finally became the panda
you were always meant to be.

1363
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,076
But, how'd you know I could?

1364
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,549
On the first day we met,

1365
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:46,030
I saw the future of kung fu.

1366
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,511
<i>And the past.</i>

1367
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,749
<i>I saw the panda
who could unite them both.</i>

1368
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,749
<i>That is why I chose you, Po.</i>

1369
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,477
Both sides of a Yin and Yang.

1370
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,474
And my true successor.

1371
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,120
Me? I can't take that.

1372
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,713
Just take it.

1373
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,358
I have a bigger one.

1374
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:21,550
I mean, you're enlightened
and everything. I'm just...

1375
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,949
Oh!

1376
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,040
Really?

1377
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,599
Yes.

1378
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,233
Now what do we do?

1379
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,510
Hmm. You tell me.

1380
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,431
No. Oogway, don't go!

1381
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,070
I'm not going anywhere.
I live here.

1382
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,559
Oh, right.

1383
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:53,633
It's you who must decide
whether to stay or go.

1384
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,677
Wait. I can go back?

1385
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,832
Who knows?
I've never tried.

1386
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,400
Wow!

1387
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,431
Po!
Oh!

1388
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,511
You can fly! Oh!

1389
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,799
Dad. Dad.

1390
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Dads!

1391
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,235
Son!

1392
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,078
Don't you go disappearing
in petals ever again.

1393
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,832
We thought we lost you.

1394
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,917
No, you saved me.

1395
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,840
You all did.

1396
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,957
Now, come on over here!

1397
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,838
Hugs!

1398
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,799
Master Shifu!

1399
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,118
The student has
truly become the tea...

1400
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,519
Wait. Where did
you get that?

1401
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,831
Oh, this. Oogway gave it
to me in the Spirit Realm.

1402
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,151
Oh... Of course he did.

1403
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,276
I think I mastered chi.

1404
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,112
Of course you did.

1405
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,470
Can you teach me?

1406
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,754
Ready!

1407
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,469
Whoa!

1408
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,800
Ow!

1409
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,678
Monkey, help me!

1410
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,273
Greeny Baby!

1411
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,440
Get 'em off me!

1412
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,909
Mmm! Hello.

1413
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,668
Skadoosh.

1414
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,237
