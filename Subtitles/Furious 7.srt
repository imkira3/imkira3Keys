LONDON, ENGLAND

5
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,800
They say if you want a glimpse of the future...

6
00:00:55,716 --> 00:00:57,454
Just look behind you.

7
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:01,062
I used to think that was bollocks.

8
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:04,349
Now I realize...

9
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,567
you can't outrun the past.

10
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:16,061
When we were kids...

11
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:20,745
You'd start fights with the toughest bastards in the yard.

12
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:22,960
But I was the one...

13
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:25,334
who were to step in and finish them.

14
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:27,623
Rest now, little brother.

15
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,318
While I settle your one last score.

16
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:38,474
Take care of my brother.

17
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,368
Anything happens to him...

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,295
I'll come back looking for you.

19
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:07,317
Here.

20
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:08,318
Hold this.

21
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:07,111
<b>FAST & FURIOUS 7</b>

22
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,492
Come on, Dom, so where are you taking me?

23
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:19,458
They say an open road helps you think...

24
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,062
about where you've been...

25
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,058
where you're going.

26
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,750
So you don't remember any of this yet?

27
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:30,438
It's not fair.

28
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:32,602
You know I don't.

29
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:40,207
So what is it exactly that you're trying to show me?

30
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:42,524
That.

31
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:48,523
Race Wars.

32
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:51,765
We used to come here?

33
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:53,297
"Come here"?

34
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,962
We invented it.

35
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,781
RACE WARS

36
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:39,248
Keep it under 9000 rpms.

37
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:42,629
Kid's gonna fire his pistons after the first 200.

38
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:46,263
You know that's not my style, I got to ride or die, right?

39
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,249
How about you just ride on this one.

40
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:09,999
Are you ready?

41
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:13,873
I know you're ready!

42
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:29,175
Go!

43
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,185
Nice job!

44
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:19,781
Hey!

45
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,539
That's the girl I heard so much about.

46
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,882
Where you been at, ghost girl?

47
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:29,864
That's the girl...

48
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:32,713
Ghost girl...

49
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,054
Letty, what the hell?

50
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:52,578
Damn, Dom! Your girl's still got that swing, homie.

51
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:56,188
You never could take a punch.

52
00:06:58,008 --> 00:06:59,159
Right, right.

53
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,108
Hey, man, I'm glad you're back, man. It's good to see you.

54
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:04,204
Good to see you, Hektor.

55
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:25,961
Alright. We made it, Jack.

56
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:28,347
- Yeah, we made it! - Yeah, we made it.

57
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,261
I just gotta, find that door button.

58
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:31,956
Buddy where's the door button at? Do you know?

59
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,005
- Hey. - Hey.

60
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,119
Yeah, of course.

61
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:37,865
I'm new to this.

62
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,659
Yeah, you don't seem like the minivan type.

63
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:40,431
No, not exactly.

64
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,453
Hey buddy you didn't give me a high-five? Wait, wait, wait.

65
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:44,259
High-five! All right! Yeah, buddy.

66
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:45,848
Appreciate it, thank you.

67
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,668
Don't worry, you'll get used to this in no time.

68
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:51,333
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

69
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,494
First time I saw this...

70
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:28,918
I thought it was kind of funny.

71
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:35,479
I guess now, the joke's on me.

72
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,367
What are you doing?

73
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,004
What I should've done a long time ago.

74
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:44,634
Stop!

75
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:47,343
Look at it.

76
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:49,538
It's the truth.

77
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,966
That's the date that I lost my memory.

78
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:56,892
That's the date that Letty died.

79
00:08:58,536 --> 00:08:59,983
And I was born.

80
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:00,593
No.

81
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:02,346
You never died.

82
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:04,996
Do you know how hard it is for me when you look at me?

83
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,769
And you see me through 15 years of memories?

84
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:11,347
Every beautiful moment we've ever had.

85
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,699
I see it in your eyes.

86
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:16,400
I can't give that to you.

87
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,579
I got nothing.

88
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:20,000
You got me.

89
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:24,092
And you've got only a piece of me.

90
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:27,242
I have to find myself.

91
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,483
For me.

92
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,500
Goodbye, Dom.

93
00:09:56,921 --> 00:10:00,317
DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE LOS ANGELES DIVISION

94
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:08,511
You're disappointed, aren't you?

95
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,354
What are you talking about?

96
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:12,487
The last arrest.

97
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,729
It was too easy. Target didn't even run.

98
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:16,842
Ah, it's okay.

99
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,140
Gives me a chance to hit the iron.

100
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:22,736
Also, lets me work on my stamping skills.

101
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:25,854
You're a terrible liar.

102
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:28,605
See you tomorrow, boss.

103
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:30,622
- I'll see you then. - Don't stay too late.

104
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,216
I'll stay as long as I want, woman.

105
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:33,941
I knew you'd say that.

106
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:47,618
Elena?

107
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,436
What's this?

108
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:58,786
It's the letter of recommendation you asked for.

109
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,490
Just know I meant every word in there.

110
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,575
Thanks, Hobbs.

111
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,302
Thanks for everything.

112
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,978
Come on, way too sentimental right now.

113
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,785
Get home. Good night.

114
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:16,157
Okay. Bye.

115
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,399
Just one sec.

116
00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:00,498
You sure as hell ain't the IT guy so you better start talking...

117
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:02,928
before I break that finger six different ways...

118
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,053
and stick it straight right where the sun doesn't shine.

119
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,154
Agent Hobbs, right?

120
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,126
That's right.

121
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,454
I'm also the last man on Earth whose computer you wanna be hacking into.

122
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:19,180
You just earned yourself a dance with the devil, boy.

123
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,631
You're under arrest.

124
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:25,525
Like I said, I'm here for the team that crippled my brother.

125
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,603
There ain't no goddamn team.

126
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:32,324
It was just one man, and he's standing right in front of you.

127
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,931
The lady was right.

128
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:45,729
You are a terrible liar.

129
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:48,377
Goddamn IT guys.

130
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:02,826
Hobbs!

131
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:05,064
On me!

132
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:16,174
Elena!

133
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:38,552
Hobbs?

134
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,719
Hobbs!

135
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:12,714
Alright buddy, we gotta go or we'll be late.

136
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,828
Come on.

137
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:15,981
Okay, uhh.

138
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,241
What do you think?

139
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,420
Parking brake slide right up to the school?

140
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:21,633
Where's mommy?

141
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,642
I don't know. She's up there. She's coming.

142
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:25,955
Oh.

143
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:31,693
Watch your head.

144
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:34,968
Dom, you have a package out here.

145
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:36,537
From Tokyo.

146
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:37,845
Tokyo?

147
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:41,230
What's Han trying, to convert me over to a turbo charger?

148
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:42,635
You ready?

149
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:44,314
There we go.

150
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:46,991
Hey buddy, cars don't fly.

151
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:49,300
Hey, cars don't fly.

152
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:50,268
This one did, huh?

153
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:52,389
Brian in a minivan.

154
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:54,273
Things have changed.

155
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:55,894
He's struggling, Dom.

156
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:58,530
He doesn't want me to see it...

157
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:02,005
but the white picket fence is like an anchor for him. I can tell.

158
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:06,131
I tried to talk to him the other night. Do you know what he said?

159
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:09,097
He doesn't miss the girls. He doesn't miss the cars.

160
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,803
He misses the bullets.

161
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:14,895
Let him settle in. Give him time.

162
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:17,961
How does nine months sound?

163
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,245
I'm having another baby.

164
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,206
And you didn't tell him, did you?

165
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,252
You gotta tell him.

166
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:39,185
I don't want him to be disappointed with this life.

167
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,725
With me.

168
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:45,791
He will never be disappointed with you.

169
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,467
You're the best thing that's ever happened to him.

170
00:16:51,856 --> 00:16:53,162
Thank you.

171
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:03,812
Yeah?

172
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,448
Dominic Toretto.

173
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:08,337
You don't know me.

174
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,569
You're about to.

175
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,179
Private number Tokyo, Japan

176
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:14,233
Get down!

177
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:34,594
Jack!

178
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:40,995
Jack!

179
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,943
Shattered his collarbone, fractured his leg in two places.

180
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,328
He only regained consciousness this morning.

181
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:21,470
First thing he said was, "Get me Dom".

182
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,125
He's in there.

183
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:37,768
You okay?

184
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:40,861
I'm fine.

185
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:43,665
He's waiting. Let's go.

186
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:55,714
Got something for you.

187
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:00,304
Your files.

188
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:01,455
Thank you.

189
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,296
You risk life and limb to save the free world...

190
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:06,762
and what do they give you?

191
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:09,815
Jell-O and a bad 70's TV show.

192
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,255
Y'know, it's got its perks.

193
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:16,528
Sponge baths ain't that bad.

194
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:17,637
Dad!

195
00:19:17,713 --> 00:19:18,713
I'm sorry, baby.

196
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:19,982
"Dad"?

197
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:22,493
Honey, I want to introduce you to somebody.

198
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,347
He's a, uhh...

199
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:26,345
He's an old friend.

200
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:27,847
Go on and say hello.

201
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:29,147
Dominic Toretto, right?

202
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,940
My dad said, he kicked your ass once.

203
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:57,952
Who did this?

204
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:01,102
You remember Owen Shaw?

205
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:05,239
The one we tore half of London down trying to get.

206
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:06,335
Well...

207
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:08,403
This is his big, bad brother.

208
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:09,528
Take a look at this.

209
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,669
"Deckard Shaw"

210
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,182
British Special Forces assassin.

211
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,418
The kind of unique asset...

212
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,649
that no government would ever admit to employing.

213
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:25,912
Black Ops boys.

214
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,749
Worse. They created a monster.

215
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:33,048
They felt Shaw was a necessary evil until eventually...

216
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,929
they decided he was unnecessary.

217
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,727
The powers that be, felt that he knew just a little bit too much.

218
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,563
The asset became a liability.

219
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:45,450
So they sent in 20 elite operatives to retire him.

220
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
And they missed.

221
00:20:47,304 --> 00:20:49,977
That was 6 years ago and Shaw's been a ghost ever since.

222
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:51,172
Until now.

223
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,270
How do I find him?

224
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:58,182
The official answer is: you don't.

225
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,935
He killed Han.

226
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:04,890
Almost killed my family.

227
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:07,018
He also tried to put me in a body bag, too.

228
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,585
Which is why when I get out, I'm gonna put a hurt on him so bad...

229
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:12,366
he's gonna wish his mother had kept her legs closed.

230
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:15,382
But until then, my official answer to you...

231
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:17,329
is stand down.

232
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,343
Now you know I can't do that.

233
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:20,683
I do know you, Dom.

234
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:24,492
Which is why now I give you a brother to brother answer.

235
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:27,131
You do whatever it is you gotta do.

236
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,050
When you find that sumbitch...

237
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:31,852
Just do me one favor.

238
00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:33,041
What's that?

239
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:36,362
Don't miss.

240
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:42,654
MONTECRISTO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

241
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:47,384
Thank you so much for letting us stay, Mando.

242
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:48,632
I hope it's not a problem.

243
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:51,562
Listen, Dom needed a safe delivered to Rio in two days.

244
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:52,808
That was a problem.

245
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:55,053
Hosting his family in the Dominican Republic,

246
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:56,361
that is vacation.

247
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:57,811
Anyone messes with you here...

248
00:21:57,927 --> 00:21:59,821
they're messing with the entire country.

249
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:00,976
You'll be safe.

250
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:12,335
Yeah, they're here. I picked them up myself at the airport.

251
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,514
Hold on. Your brother.

252
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,150
Dom.

253
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:17,477
Yeah, Mia, it's me.

254
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:18,595
How's it going there?

255
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:21,321
We're at Mando's. This place is like a fortress.

256
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:24,841
You should see Brian. He's in full FBI mode.

257
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:28,124
He built a surveillance hub in Mando's garage and everything.

258
00:22:28,237 --> 00:22:30,682
What about you? Did you find out who's after us?

259
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:33,667
Looks like the sins of London have followed us home.

260
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:35,541
How did Buster take the news?

261
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:36,652
I can't tell him.

262
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:39,196
If he knew about the baby, he'd stay here with us.

263
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:42,043
And with all that's going on, you're gonna need him by your side.

264
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:45,068
Just watch out for him. Keep him safe.

265
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,086
And come home together.

266
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,823
Tell Brian I'll see him in LA in two days.

267
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:51,566
Where are you going?

268
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,590
Tokyo.

269
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,168
I'm bringing Han home.

270
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,143
Authorities are still trying to determine...

271
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,862
the motive behind this daring attack here at the office...

272
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:06,285
of the US Diplomatic Security Service in downtown Los 羘geles...

273
00:23:06,396 --> 00:23:07,436
less than 36 hours ago.

274
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:09,825
Facts are still coming in...

275
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:12,934
but what is known is the suspect entered the building's 4th floor...

276
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,293
Hey.

277
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,370
- You okay? - Yeah.

278
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:21,380
This guy's just, relentless.

279
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:24,798
That's why Dom needs you.

280
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,361
You two need to find this guy and you need to stop him...

281
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,769
before he does any more damage to our family.

282
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:34,174
I just...

283
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,923
I've screwed up so many things.

284
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:41,853
I couldn't live with myself if I screwed this up, too.

285
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:43,880
You won't.

286
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,115
I believe in you.

287
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,780
I believe in us. That's all that matters.

288
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:52,655
I love you, Brian.

289
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,513
Love you, baby.

290
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:09,304
Just promise me. After this, we're done.

291
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,762
No more jobs, no more enemies.

292
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:13,897
Come back to us.

293
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:15,884
I won't let you down, Mia.

294
00:24:17,752 --> 00:24:18,762
I know.

295
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:23,773
TOKYO, JAPAN

296
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,790
Hey yo, Sean!

297
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:37,469
Hey, check this out, man.

298
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,026
This dude over here wanna race the new DK.

299
00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:41,272
Not tonight, Twinkie.

300
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:44,803
He said he knew Han.

301
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,245
Han said you was fast, but not that damn fast.

302
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:58,521
Who said American muscle can't drift?

303
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:02,812
Han mentioned he left his enemies in his rear view.

304
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:05,960
He never talked about it much.

305
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,666
Always playing it close to the vest.

306
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:17,305
We found a couple of things by the crash.

307
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:20,299
Wasn't much left.

308
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:28,788
Gisele.

309
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:34,061
Yeah.

310
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:36,325
There's one more thing.

311
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:40,614
I found this.

312
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,182
Must've meant something to him.

313
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:49,211
When you find the guy that killed Han...

314
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,065
What are you going to do?

315
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:56,731
Words ain't even been invented yet.

316
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:21,552
They say to live in the hearts of those we leave behind...

317
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:23,933
is not to die.

318
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:26,790
But he put you in his grave.

319
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,689
So now I'll do the same to him.

320
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,133
I can't do no more funerals.

321
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:40,922
First, Han...

322
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:46,221
Now Hobbs is laid out, of all people.

323
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,964
We're being hunted.

324
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:01,773
You know he's out there somewhere watching, right?

325
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:04,072
I hope so.

326
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:05,610
That means he's close.

327
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,754
Just promise me, Brian.

328
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:11,363
No more funerals.

329
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:13,152
Just one more.

330
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:18,197
His.

331
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,797
You never should've messed with a man's family.

332
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:50,891
I told your brother the same thing.

333
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:55,858
Reinforced your chassis.

334
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,873
Just like going into the ring with weighted gloves.

335
00:29:58,874 --> 00:30:01,394
Your mistake. I'm not here to play games.

336
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:03,486
See, you and me...

337
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:05,912
We're from different worlds.

338
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,919
Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner streets than the ones you're used to.

339
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:11,493
Stick around.

340
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,494
It's gonna get a lot meaner.

341
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,363
You think this was gonna be a street fight?

342
00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:39,783
On the ground!

343
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:41,549
Now!

344
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:45,608
Drop him or I will drop you!

345
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,718
Woah, woah!

346
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:49,832
Easy, guys. We're on the same team here.

347
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:52,078
Mr. Toretto...

348
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:53,728
I'm here on the recommendation...

349
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,345
of a, mutual friend of ours.

350
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,176
- Mr. Hobbs? - Who the hell are you?

351
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:58,761
Me? I'm just a guy.

352
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,241
I'm, Mr. Nobody.

353
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:03,446
That's a big entrance for a nobody.

354
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:06,305
And the guy who put our mutual friend in the hospital...

355
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:08,990
you just let him get away.

356
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:12,448
I think I might've just saved your ass there, Dom.

357
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:15,744
Listen, you think you can let go of my guy there?

358
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:17,403
He's beginning to turn a little blue.

359
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:20,816
I appreciate that.

360
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:23,043
Here they come.

361
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:24,872
Listen, Dom.

362
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:29,383
There's a war going on between shadows and ghosts like me.

363
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:34,353
You and your team unwittingly walked into the middle of it in London...

364
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,586
and it appears it's now followed you home.

365
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:40,343
It's up to you.

366
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,762
I'm gonna have a beer.

367
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:44,553
You're welcome to join me.

368
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,192
By the way, I can get you Deckard Shaw.

369
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:57,406
BASE OF OPERATIONS EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA

370
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:01,372
Belgian ale.

371
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:06,651
Man, those monks got it right.

372
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:10,760
I don't know about the whole celibacy thing, but when it comes to beer...

373
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,305
Would you like one?

374
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:15,715
I'm more of a Corona man myself.

375
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:22,452
Your files, not only detailed...

376
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:26,510
It's, extremely entertaining.

377
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,585
Look, Shaw's power is that he's a shadow.

378
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:38,397
He's really good at getting in and out of places...

379
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,850
without being seen and leaving nothing but a body count in his wake.

380
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:44,045
He's a legitimate English badass.

381
00:32:44,324 --> 00:32:48,134
But to be honest with you Dom, I don't give two shits about Deckard Shaw.

382
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:49,548
It's you I want.

383
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:54,165
Because you and I can help each other get what we both need.

384
00:32:55,036 --> 00:32:56,720
I'm listening.

385
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,700
Just recently, a private military company...

386
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,866
led by a wanted terrorist named Mose Jakande...

387
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,386
kidnapped a hacker known only by the name "Ramsey".

388
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,452
Lady Liberty's got her panties in a bunch over this but rightfully so...

389
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:10,809
because this Ramsey has created something interesting.

390
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,140
- Bring it up. - Yes, sir.

391
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:13,736
Say hello...

392
00:33:14,298 --> 00:33:16,095
To God's Eye.

393
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:18,970
Now this little bastard hacks into anything that's on a digital network.

394
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:22,661
That means every cellphone, satellite, ATM machine, and computer,

395
00:33:22,774 --> 00:33:23,774
simultaneously.

396
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:27,642
If it's got a microphone or a lens, God's Eye can use it to find you.

397
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:30,231
So you invited me here to show me a tracking device.

398
00:33:30,373 --> 00:33:31,971
On steroids. Lots of them.

399
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,559
Let me put it to you this way.

400
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:36,621
It took us nearly a decade to find Osama bin Laden.

401
00:33:36,735 --> 00:33:39,352
With this, we could locate him anywhere on the planet

402
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,582
in a couple of hours.

403
00:33:40,692 --> 00:33:43,105
Now that's a serious piece of machinery...

404
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:45,341
that could be catastrophic in the wrong hands.

405
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:47,608
But for some very nauseating, political reasons...

406
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:51,815
any rescue plans involving any US government forces or entity...

407
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:53,861
has been strictly ruled out.

408
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:57,389
And that's why I need you.

409
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,262
But why do I need you?

410
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:04,112
I mean I could go back outside, enjoy the rest of the Coronas...

411
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:06,257
let Shaw come to me.

412
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,206
You could do that. How's that working out for you so far?

413
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:11,656
You got one friend in the ground, another one in the hospital...

414
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,005
and then of course there's that little issue of the bomb...

415
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:15,412
that destroyed your home.

416
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:19,613
Shaw lives in a world that doesn't play by your rules.

417
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:22,169
Like it or not...

418
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,985
you live in that world now, too.

419
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,060
You wanna know how to kill a shadow?

420
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:29,143
You just shine a little light on it.

421
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:31,606
If you get the God's Eye for me...

422
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:35,267
I've already got authorization for you to use it until you get Shaw.

423
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,733
You go from the hunted, to the hunter.

424
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:40,211
And there's no place on Earth Shaw can hide from you.

425
00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:41,493
More importantly,

426
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:44,721
you and your family...

427
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,547
don't go to any more funerals.

428
00:34:48,473 --> 00:34:51,574
You get Ramsey, you get the God's Eye...

429
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:52,789
You get Shaw.

430
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:56,521
Well that's the windup and the pitch.

431
00:34:57,464 --> 00:35:02,332
Now that I've given you this incredibly sensitive and highly classified information...

432
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,529
What do you think, Toretto?

433
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,064
I think you already know what I'm gonna do.

434
00:35:07,143 --> 00:35:08,143
Good.

435
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:10,744
But, it'll be my way.

436
00:35:11,963 --> 00:35:13,059
And my crew.

437
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,932
I assumed you might say that.

438
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:18,993
Which is why I've taken the liberty of gathering your team.

439
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:32,763
This is crazy.

440
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:35,612
What the hell is going on in here?

441
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:41,654
Our intelligence suggests that Ramsey will be transported...

442
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:44,155
by an armed motorcade through the Caucasus mountain range.

443
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,418
If they clear this range and reach their destination...

444
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,236
Ramsey's as good as gone.

445
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,542
So let me get this straight.

446
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:51,838
There's only one road that leads in or out...?

447
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:53,789
Sheer drops on every side...

448
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:57,070
A motorcade from hell protected by a small army...

449
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:58,879
from one mile on either direction?

450
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,752
Yeah, that's about it.

451
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:03,284
- You done? - No, I'm not done.

452
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:07,451
So you all wanted me to break into a police station, fine.

453
00:36:07,574 --> 00:36:09,379
Then you asked me to stop a tank.

454
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,363
I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.

455
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:13,285
Then you came up with this brillant idea...

456
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:16,640
to shoot down one of the largest airplanes, ever.

457
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:18,729
I shot that shit outta the sky...

458
00:36:20,668 --> 00:36:21,668
It's nothing.

459
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,469
But this right here, my friend...

460
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:28,013
happens to be the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my life.

461
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,734
I forgot that, you were the only one to bring that plane down.

462
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:34,851
No, only thing I've ever seen him take down was "No knees" Denise.

463
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,451
Remember? At prom?

464
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,179
Really, Brian? You're gonna do that right here?

465
00:36:39,286 --> 00:36:41,006
See, y'all try'na get me off my point.

466
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:44,691
All I'm saying is, I'm tired of everybody around me...

467
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:46,170
making all the decisions.

468
00:36:46,968 --> 00:36:48,268
This time, I lead.

469
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:51,900
Seriously. If I don't start making decisions, I'm out.

470
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:53,036
All right, Roman.

471
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:55,214
What do you got?

472
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,370
I mean, I wouldn't try to get into the whole leadership thing, like, now.

473
00:37:01,446 --> 00:37:02,807
You know what I'm saying? I'm just kind of...

474
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,037
Talking about like, at some point.

475
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,599
Like, you know, when we...

476
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:08,182
Whatever. I mean, I think...

477
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:11,825
Let's hit it from here.

478
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:13,690
- I don't think that that's... - No, don't think.

479
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:15,309
That's my job.

480
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:19,529
Okay.

481
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:22,817
It is impossible to hit it there.

482
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:26,387
That is literally the most secure spot on the mountain.

483
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:29,568
Why? Because you cannot physically access it.

484
00:37:29,692 --> 00:37:31,557
Now see, that's what makes it so sweet.

485
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:34,746
Because it's the place that they least expect us to hit them from.

486
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:37,811
As much as I hate to admit it, he's on to something there.

487
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:38,925
What do you think, Dom?

488
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:40,748
Here?

489
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:41,772
Yeah.

490
00:37:42,854 --> 00:37:44,688
I think we got a plan.

491
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,366
Completely wrong thinking.

492
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:48,599
And I like it.

493
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:51,166
- You see? - I'm good at this.

494
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,860
Good?

495
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,129
Okay.

496
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:56,784
How are you planning on getting on that road?

497
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,425
Well, Tej?

498
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:03,490
I think I may actually have a plan for that.

499
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,087
What? I delegated.

500
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:08,436
That's what good leaders do.

501
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,510
Leader!

502
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:13,070
You know, when I was reading your files...

503
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:15,563
I was impressed with what you've accomplished with your team.

504
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:18,357
But, meeting them now I gotta say, Dom...

505
00:38:19,502 --> 00:38:20,880
you truly have a gift.

506
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:27,996
Consider my workshop your new playhouse.

507
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,500
I think you'll find our cars...

508
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:31,316
extremely appealing.

509
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:33,454
And your team...

510
00:38:34,507 --> 00:38:35,517
is now complete.

511
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:47,845
I went to the house.

512
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:50,849
I was looking for you everywhere.

513
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,215
You scared the shit outta me.

514
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:00,164
You will never be alone...

515
00:39:03,522 --> 00:39:04,644
Where did you find that?

516
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:09,792
Found it in Han's car.

517
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,678
It was left as a message.

518
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,713
A message I plan on returning.

519
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:16,594
Can you ride?

520
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:18,254
Yeah, of course I can.

521
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,569
Han was my family, too.

522
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:26,225
Brian!

523
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,891
We're gonna need long travel suspension...

524
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,108
limited slip differentials in all of them.

525
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,208
How you doing.

526
00:39:32,762 --> 00:39:33,792
Tej!

527
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:36,887
I want the demon lovechild between that...

528
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:39,539
and that.

529
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,201
That's a lot of armor.

530
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:44,982
Just gonna add more weight, slow you down.

531
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,999
This time it ain't just about being fast.

532
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:58,870
Yeah, I'm good.

533
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:02,648
From the streets, you know what I'm sayin'?

534
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,406
It's nothing.

535
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:12,850
Hey, Roman, you're freaking out, ain't you?

536
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:15,054
- No. - Yeah, you are.

537
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:16,127
I said, no.

538
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:19,587
Listen man, it takes a grown man to embrace his feelings.

539
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,971
If you need to cry, just go ahead and cry.

540
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:25,963
As your friend, you know I'm concerned about your well-being.

541
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:27,550
Which is why I took the precaution...

542
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:30,011
of putting some adult diapers in your glove compartment.

543
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:31,321
Can you just chill out, man?

544
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:36,075
I have seen some crazy shit, Dom, but this really could make some waves.

545
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:39,006
So let's just try to keep it as low key as possible, huh?

546
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,628
Don't I always?

547
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:43,729
I tell you what: you knock it down a couple of notches this time...

548
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:47,076
and I'll swap out my Belgian for a keg of Corona.

549
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,925
You'd be doing yourself a favor there.

550
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:53,415
Can somebody just walk me through what we're supposed to be doing here?

551
00:40:53,476 --> 00:40:55,319
Come on, Rom. This was your plan, you gotta embrace it.

552
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:56,685
No, this was not my plan.

553
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:02,506
Yeah, here we go. Gametime.

554
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,571
Roman, you need some fresh air?

555
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:19,515
'Cause you about to get a whole lot of it.

556
00:41:23,165 --> 00:41:24,470
Okay, here we go!

557
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:44,590
Just when you didn't think it can get any better, huh?

558
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:52,382
Oh, shit!

559
00:42:07,407 --> 00:42:08,407
Now we're moving.

560
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:18,457
Everybody good? Everybody make it out?

561
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,890
You should tell 'em, that this is not for you!

562
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:26,965
This is not your mission!

563
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:29,839
Rom, what's up man! Talk to me, come on!

564
00:42:30,206 --> 00:42:32,101
- I can't do it. - The hell, you can't!

565
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,643
Come on man! You throw that thing in reverse and get your ass out here now!

566
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:38,114
Look I can't do it, okay? Listen to what I'm saying.

567
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:39,115
Now isn't the time!

568
00:42:39,144 --> 00:42:40,589
I'mma stay up here with the pilot.

569
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:43,816
We're gonna circle around and make sure we're holding them down from up here!

570
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:45,221
We're running out of time!

571
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,493
The chute is guided by GPS!

572
00:42:47,604 --> 00:42:49,405
You don't have to do anything!

573
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,181
- Tej! - I'm already on it.

574
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:53,063
Listen, man. Listen

575
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:56,522
I'm sorry to let y'all down, okay? I'mma go ahead and stay up here.

576
00:42:56,647 --> 00:42:57,448
No, brother.

577
00:42:57,563 --> 00:42:59,829
- I'm sorry to let you down. - What?

578
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:02,488
Is that...?

579
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:07,460
Tej! What are you doing?

580
00:43:10,782 --> 00:43:14,647
No!

581
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:15,920
Tej!

582
00:43:18,446 --> 00:43:19,784
I hate you, Tej!

583
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:24,137
Get ready!

584
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:25,660
Ground's coming fast!

585
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:34,755
C'mon, baby.

586
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:36,019
Come on.

587
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:25,130
Touchdown, baby!

588
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:31,031
Car check. Call it in.

589
00:44:31,107 --> 00:44:32,287
- Check. - Check.

590
00:44:32,288 --> 00:44:33,347
I'm good, let's do this.

591
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:37,898
Hello? Please man!

592
00:44:38,014 --> 00:44:39,736
Get me outta here, somebody!

593
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:41,098
No! The trees!

594
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,805
Shit.

595
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:44,689
Sit tight, Roman. We'll come back for you.

596
00:44:44,771 --> 00:44:46,048
This is not the plan!

597
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,861
CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS, AZERBAIJAN

598
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,450
All right.

599
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:08,903
You got one chance to hit them here, Dom.

600
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,564
You miss, they'll make it to their black site...

601
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:13,177
they'll squeeze whatever information they need out of Ramsey.

602
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:16,080
The device and your chance of ever getting Shaw will be gone for good.

603
00:45:16,189 --> 00:45:17,211
That ain't gonna happen.

604
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:18,905
I'll see you at the pickup.

605
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:25,575
Ramsey, will be in the bus.

606
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:26,623
Then let's do this.

607
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:38,198
Captain we have company. Four cars inbound.

608
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,276
What, no!

609
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:07,018
- Tej, shoot it! - I'm on the way!

610
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:13,160
All right, formation!

611
00:46:19,926 --> 00:46:21,115
Bulletproof, baby.

612
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:28,064
Punch it!

613
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:53,807
Strike!

614
00:47:04,243 --> 00:47:05,341
Guns, free.

615
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:07,168
Yes, sir.

616
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:11,936
No!

617
00:47:15,138 --> 00:47:16,138
Shit!

618
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:17,418
Get out of the way!

619
00:47:30,618 --> 00:47:32,534
Those aren't guns, those are goddamn cannons!

620
00:47:32,645 --> 00:47:33,835
Armor piercing rounds!

621
00:47:58,023 --> 00:47:59,023
Hook 'em up.

622
00:48:05,942 --> 00:48:07,446
Brian, Tej, blow it!

623
00:48:16,425 --> 00:48:17,425
Lock it up.

624
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,939
Brian, you're up!

625
00:48:48,437 --> 00:48:49,945
Little closer, Tej!

626
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,279
Ramsey?

627
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:27,752
Stay away from me! Stay back!

628
00:49:27,866 --> 00:49:29,090
Don't you touch me!

629
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:30,942
My name's Brian, and I'm gonna get you out of here...

630
00:49:30,943 --> 00:49:32,198
but I'm gonna need you to settle down, all right?

631
00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:33,570
I'm gonna cut those things off of you.

632
00:49:49,276 --> 00:49:50,276
Sir?

633
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,304
Sir, we have an unidentified vehicle approaching.

634
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,870
Come on! Closer!

635
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,303
You have to jump!

636
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,594
We're out of time. Come on.

637
00:49:59,672 --> 00:50:00,952
We gotta get out of here!

638
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:02,608
Come on!

639
00:50:03,002 --> 00:50:04,002
Look at me!

640
00:50:04,026 --> 00:50:06,247
If you don't jump, we're gonna die! Okay?

641
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:08,361
You're jumping. Come on!

642
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:09,475
One.

643
00:50:09,862 --> 00:50:10,862
Two!

644
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:21,150
Well, well, well.

645
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,740
Take my hand!

646
00:50:44,196 --> 00:50:46,597
Welcome to the party, Mr. Shaw.

647
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:37,592
Letty, stay with Brian.

648
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,300
Oh shit!

649
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,365
What are you doing? This is crazy!

650
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:10,741
Keeping you alive!

651
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:57,069
There's a cliff.

652
00:52:57,429 --> 00:52:59,120
Cliff! cliff!

653
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:41,494
No!

654
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,476
Too slow!

655
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:16,808
Yeah!

656
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,690
I'm back, bitches!

657
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:53,930
You good?

658
00:56:53,976 --> 00:56:55,181
Thank you.

659
00:57:12,452 --> 00:57:13,822
Roman! Get back to the others.

660
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:14,448
What about you?

661
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:15,915
Don't worry about me.

662
00:58:13,893 --> 00:58:16,520
I have to say, I am impressed.

663
00:58:17,048 --> 00:58:19,906
I would very much like to know the name...

664
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:23,478
of the man who is causing me so much trouble.

665
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:25,975
There is no way out of there.

666
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:27,964
What is he doing?

667
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:29,939
He's frozen like a damn deer on headlights.

668
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:31,742
Toretto ain't no deer.

669
00:58:31,894 --> 00:58:33,013
Come on, Dominic.

670
00:58:33,672 --> 00:58:36,943
Give us the girl, and I'll let you live.

671
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,600
What are you going to do?

672
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:43,347
You might wanna put on your helmet for this one.

673
00:58:52,582 --> 00:58:54,053
Target the driver!

674
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,962
Dammit! What is he thinking?

675
00:59:04,418 --> 00:59:05,818
You're insane!

676
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:15,517
You're pointing the wrong way!

677
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:17,166
Am I now?

678
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,741
Fire on my mark.

679
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:27,859
Interesting.

680
00:59:28,091 --> 00:59:29,091
Three!

681
00:59:29,752 --> 00:59:30,752
Two!

682
00:59:31,247 --> 00:59:32,247
Hold on.

683
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:33,249
One!

684
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,290
Fire!

685
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:32,138
Looks like our demon lovechild worked.

686
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,833
That's one way down a mountain.

687
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:36,126
Where's Ramsey?

688
01:00:50,245 --> 01:00:52,008
Hello Kitty's awake.

689
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,409
She don't look like a hacker to me.

690
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:00,259
Oh yeah? And what do hackers look like?

691
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,459
They don't suppose to look...

692
01:01:01,571 --> 01:01:02,571
like that.

693
01:01:03,175 --> 01:01:07,095
I'm just saying, like, how they normally wear them li'l weird glasses...

694
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,056
that's all crooked, with pimples all over they face from drinking soda.

695
01:01:11,603 --> 01:01:14,498
I mean trust me, with a body like that...

696
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:16,415
I ain't gonna park it behind a computer.

697
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,140
How you feeling?

698
01:01:19,518 --> 01:01:20,574
Did you hit your head?

699
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,265
Feeling nauseous? Ears ringing?

700
01:01:24,758 --> 01:01:25,758
No?

701
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,152
Where's my shoe?

702
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:29,390
It flew off when you crashed.

703
01:01:29,502 --> 01:01:32,196
When you start experiencing any of those things, let me know. Okay?

704
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:35,117
I don't know whether to thank you for rescuing me...

705
01:01:35,118 --> 01:01:37,746
or to kick your ass for throwing me off a cliff.

706
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:40,664
Thank us or kick our ass, huh?

707
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,016
How about you tell us where that device is?

708
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:48,360
I mailed it to a friend.

709
01:01:48,812 --> 01:01:50,058
In Abu Dhabi.

710
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:51,976
That was pretty easy.

711
01:01:52,678 --> 01:01:55,112
That other team would've tortured you for that information.

712
01:01:55,113 --> 01:01:56,419
I didn't trust them.

713
01:01:57,407 --> 01:01:58,598
I trust you.

714
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:03,029
Now why would you trust us? You barely know us.

715
01:02:03,173 --> 01:02:04,477
I know enough.

716
01:02:06,252 --> 01:02:09,598
Ex-cop. Military, something like that.

717
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:12,408
The way you took out those guys, serious training.

718
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:16,670
Tech guy. Offended by the hacker remark, naturally.

719
01:02:17,718 --> 01:02:18,718
Alpha.

720
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Mrs. Alpha.

721
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:24,157
Joker.

722
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:25,903
Wrong.

723
01:02:27,466 --> 01:02:28,647
Double Alpha.

724
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:31,439
Man-candy. Y'know what I'm saying?

725
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,031
Man, sit your candy-ass down.

726
01:02:35,479 --> 01:02:37,407
The disrespect is real around here.

727
01:02:37,518 --> 01:02:40,311
Life is binary. Zeroes and ones.

728
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:42,470
Only two things keep a group like this together.

729
01:02:42,506 --> 01:02:43,989
Fear or loyalty.

730
01:02:44,105 --> 01:02:46,616
And I don't see a drop of fear among you guys.

731
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:49,169
Very impressive. Just one thing.

732
01:02:49,749 --> 01:02:51,071
They're not married.

733
01:02:51,145 --> 01:02:53,521
She's so off as crack, you're just gonna roll with it?

734
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:56,199
You're telling me there can't be a double alpha in one group?

735
01:02:56,274 --> 01:02:57,499
You work for the US government?

736
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:01,172
We got similar interests.

737
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:06,763
Tej, call it in.

738
01:03:07,596 --> 01:03:08,708
We're going to the Middle East!

739
01:03:30,162 --> 01:03:32,395
Hey, Dom, it was pretty wild in that mountain, huh?

740
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,427
That was too close.

741
01:03:35,195 --> 01:03:36,861
But we got the job done.

742
01:03:38,698 --> 01:03:40,818
Know what the crazy thing is? It's...

743
01:03:41,978 --> 01:03:43,452
You missed the bullets.

744
01:03:45,012 --> 01:03:46,651
That's messed up, huh?

745
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:50,789
Brian, I've seen you jump from trains, dive from planes.

746
01:03:51,439 --> 01:03:53,895
Hell, I saw your courage the day I met you.

747
01:03:54,014 --> 01:03:55,014
Right.

748
01:03:55,569 --> 01:03:57,929
You wanna know the bravest thing I've ever saw you do?

749
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:01,710
Be a good man to M韆.

750
01:04:02,616 --> 01:04:05,563
Being a great father to my nephew, Jack.

751
01:04:07,304 --> 01:04:08,865
Everyone's looking for their thrill...

752
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,198
but what's real,

753
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,836
is family.

754
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,751
Your family.

755
01:04:15,547 --> 01:04:17,275
Hold on to that, Brian.

756
01:04:25,398 --> 01:04:28,297
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

757
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:25,193
This was hotter than I thought it would be.

758
01:05:25,303 --> 01:05:27,804
Yeah, well, we are in the desert so, it would be hot.

759
01:05:27,955 --> 01:05:29,686
No, I ain't talking about the weather.

760
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:36,627
My, my, my.

761
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:48,079
Now that, is a woman that's worth falling out a plane for.

762
01:05:48,912 --> 01:05:52,156
Get outta there, man. I got dibs on that. You see me looking at that.

763
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:53,341
Did you just say "dibs"?

764
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,771
What are you, in the fourth grade?

765
01:05:54,846 --> 01:05:56,320
Man, can you just get outta there?

766
01:05:56,403 --> 01:05:57,557
It's a free market.

767
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:58,885
What are you talking about?

768
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:00,147
- Get outta that. - Free.

769
01:06:00,182 --> 01:06:01,462
Rock, paper, scissors for it.

770
01:06:02,438 --> 01:06:04,227
Are you guys for real right now?

771
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:05,623
Look at you.

772
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:09,382
You both look whooped already. You got stalker eyes.

773
01:06:09,457 --> 01:06:12,762
I tried to call dibs on Ramsey. Two years ago.

774
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,535
Her knee, my balls.

775
01:06:14,646 --> 01:06:16,776
Trust me, you don't wanna do that.

776
01:06:17,503 --> 01:06:19,654
Hey! Ramsey!

777
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:21,670
Hello, Zafar.

778
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:26,266
So you made some new friends.

779
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:28,576
Yeah, some short- tempered new friends.

780
01:06:28,646 --> 01:06:30,597
I need the speed drive I sent you. Where is it?

781
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:33,077
Oh good, you will be pleased to know. I sold it.

782
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:36,032
You sold it?

783
01:06:36,488 --> 01:06:37,488
You hear that?

784
01:06:37,512 --> 01:06:39,808
I asked you to take care of it.

785
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:40,714
Why on Earth would you sell it?

786
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:42,307
We're gonna need it back.

787
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,257
Impossible.

788
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:47,688
Zafar, I stashed something inside it. It's important.

789
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:48,812
Okay.

790
01:06:48,925 --> 01:06:51,596
Good news: It is safe.

791
01:06:52,281 --> 01:06:53,648
And the bad news?

792
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:55,591
It is very safe.

793
01:06:56,755 --> 01:06:59,369
Sold it to a Jordanian prince living up there.

794
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:00,932
Trust fund billionaire.

795
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,771
Said he wanted it in his supercar.

796
01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:04,687
Now see, this...

797
01:07:04,794 --> 01:07:07,750
This I like. Billionaire, supercar.

798
01:07:07,863 --> 01:07:09,322
What makes it so, "s鷓er"?

799
01:07:09,433 --> 01:07:12,139
242 mile per hour, top speed.

800
01:07:12,253 --> 01:07:14,490
And, it's bulletproof.

801
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,641
Am I the only one around right now?

802
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:21,523
It's like, y'know what I'm sayin?

803
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:22,633
.....

804
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:24,141
Whatever.

805
01:07:24,171 --> 01:07:25,172
Where does he keep it?

806
01:07:26,962 --> 01:07:27,962
In his penthouse.

807
01:07:27,986 --> 01:07:29,107
Tower number one.

808
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:32,778
Now why in the hell would he keep his car in his penthouse?

809
01:07:32,885 --> 01:07:34,178
He's a billionaire, my friend.

810
01:07:34,262 --> 01:07:35,940
He can do whatever he wants.

811
01:07:36,665 --> 01:07:38,936
Now, tomorrow happens to be the longest day of the year.

812
01:07:39,008 --> 01:07:42,416
Prince wants to celebrate it, host a party, tomorrow afternoon.

813
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:44,002
So you can get us up there, right?

814
01:07:44,148 --> 01:07:44,823
Sure.

815
01:07:44,973 --> 01:07:48,155
But not dressed like that.

816
01:08:17,868 --> 01:08:18,868
What?

817
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,208
Something wrong?

818
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:22,346
There's a billion things wrong.

819
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,385
But not in this moment.

820
01:08:26,325 --> 01:08:27,325
You look handsome.

821
01:08:28,055 --> 01:08:29,460
I feel awkward.

822
01:08:31,055 --> 01:08:32,352
You and me both.

823
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:34,597
Seeing you dressed like this...

824
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,655
Just reminds me of something.

825
01:08:38,332 --> 01:08:39,332
Of what?

826
01:08:42,045 --> 01:08:43,382
Old times.

827
01:08:56,323 --> 01:08:57,323
You okay?

828
01:08:57,908 --> 01:08:59,353
Yeah, I'm fine .

829
01:09:00,989 --> 01:09:02,319
Showtime.

830
01:09:37,538 --> 01:09:38,670
No, listen, man.

831
01:09:38,785 --> 01:09:40,937
They're telling me they party like this everyday,

832
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,652
on this level, they party everyday.

833
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:44,336
This is crazy. I might have to move out here.

834
01:09:45,044 --> 01:09:48,037
I think I'mma start a new culture. It's called "Blarab".

835
01:09:48,148 --> 01:09:49,551
You know, like Black Arab?

836
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:50,886
How are we looking, Tej?

837
01:09:50,997 --> 01:09:52,257
We're almost in position.

838
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:53,625
Okay, so this is how we work this.

839
01:09:54,113 --> 01:09:56,299
We gotta move in sync if we're gonna pull this off so let's...

840
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,654
go over it to make sure everyone clearly understands their role.

841
01:09:59,766 --> 01:10:01,209
Roman, that means you.

842
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:03,714
You know what? You're being real unprofessional right now, Tej.

843
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:07,202
The God's Eye chip is hidden in a speed drive installed in the prince's car...

844
01:10:07,272 --> 01:10:08,950
which he keeps in a safe room vault.

845
01:10:09,058 --> 01:10:11,503
Now I make 8 to 10 playing closed security.

846
01:10:11,615 --> 01:10:12,841
Not to mention the prince...

847
01:10:13,563 --> 01:10:16,042
and his personal bodyguards.

848
01:10:16,152 --> 01:10:17,778
Security cameras are clustered by the north wall

849
01:10:17,877 --> 01:10:18,577
that's where the vault is.

850
01:10:18,687 --> 01:10:21,878
Now to get in that vault, we gotta tap into the security system...

851
01:10:21,993 --> 01:10:23,454
which can be accessed in the prince's bedroom.

852
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:25,208
Alright, guys. I'm going in.

853
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:28,867
Excuse me.

854
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,535
I was just looking for...

855
01:10:31,797 --> 01:10:33,595
- The party is that way. - What?

856
01:10:33,705 --> 01:10:34,705
This room is off...

857
01:10:41,054 --> 01:10:42,054
Now once we're tapped in

858
01:10:42,143 --> 01:10:44,428
Ramsey and I can hack into the network and pop the door

859
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,122
so you can get in and get that chip.

860
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:48,258
Wait, wait. You missed a step.

861
01:10:48,334 --> 01:10:50,381
What about my steps? What am I supposed to be doing?

862
01:10:50,498 --> 01:10:51,757
No, we didn't miss anything.

863
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,097
You're special team, so when we need you...

864
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,496
do what you do best.

865
01:10:55,615 --> 01:10:56,792
And that is?

866
01:10:57,778 --> 01:11:01,616
Shine brightly, like only Roman Pearce can do.

867
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,596
Now we're talking.

868
01:11:04,711 --> 01:11:06,363
Alright, Tej. I'm in.

869
01:11:06,438 --> 01:11:08,605
Find a phone jack. The tap always runs behind that.

870
01:11:08,718 --> 01:11:12,291
It's gonna be a 350 mega Hertz CAT5 D cable.

871
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:13,943
They probably got a couple dozen back there.

872
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:16,213
But this'll be the bonded pair with a plenum coat.

873
01:11:16,285 --> 01:11:17,730
English, Tej.

874
01:11:17,843 --> 01:11:19,076
It'll be the orange wire.

875
01:11:21,741 --> 01:11:24,034
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the pilot's seat.

876
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:29,405
Alright, Roman.

877
01:11:30,205 --> 01:11:32,244
Do whatever it is you do.

878
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,160
It's your birthday, right?

879
01:11:34,877 --> 01:11:35,995
Are you Jasmine?

880
01:11:36,113 --> 01:11:38,416
God, no. Not the birthday routine.

881
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,107
Happy birthday to you. This way.

882
01:11:40,183 --> 01:11:43,352
Excuse me, so sorry. I'm coming through, sorry.

883
01:11:43,496 --> 01:11:44,496
Right this way.

884
01:11:44,558 --> 01:11:46,212
Listen, excuse me one second.

885
01:11:46,638 --> 01:11:48,431
Man, you ain't...

886
01:11:48,547 --> 01:11:50,493
Sir, thank you so much.

887
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:53,087
Listen, people. Please everybody, gather around.

888
01:11:53,205 --> 01:11:55,436
Understand something right now.

889
01:11:55,543 --> 01:11:57,350
Listen to what I'm telling y'all.

890
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:02,134
We are here to celebrate Jasmine's 18th birthday.

891
01:12:02,246 --> 01:12:03,480
Happy birthday, my dear.

892
01:12:03,587 --> 01:12:08,232
Happy birthday to you.

893
01:12:09,608 --> 01:12:11,065
To you.

894
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:13,490
To you.

895
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:16,359
I wish I didn't see that.

896
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,134
Ramsey, open it up for us.

897
01:12:22,246 --> 01:12:23,247
Copy that.

898
01:12:23,357 --> 01:12:24,535
You're in.

899
01:12:39,047 --> 01:12:40,047
You realize what this is?

900
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,163
Lykan HyperSport.

901
01:12:42,283 --> 01:12:46,030
$3.4 million. 0 to 60 in less than 30 seconds.

902
01:12:46,132 --> 01:12:49,075
There's 7 of these things in the world and this guy keeps it locked up in a vault.

903
01:12:49,183 --> 01:12:52,676
Nothing's sadder than locking a beast in a cage.

904
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,953
Right now I really wanna punch him in the face.

905
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:57,147
Okay.

906
01:12:58,624 --> 01:12:59,738
Let's get to work.

907
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:08,717
You got this, right?

908
01:13:08,741 --> 01:13:09,741
Go.

909
01:13:10,604 --> 01:13:11,604
All right.

910
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:31,158
Would you believe I knocked him out with my charm?

911
01:13:31,785 --> 01:13:33,946
You ain't that charming, bitch.

912
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:41,519
Intruders.

913
01:13:41,635 --> 01:13:42,635
Lock it down.

914
01:13:44,365 --> 01:13:46,307
No!

915
01:13:46,502 --> 01:13:49,819
Tej, our magic trick is failing. We're losing systems.

916
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:50,927
I know.

917
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:52,810
I see it.

918
01:13:52,857 --> 01:13:54,589
Tej, talk to me.

919
01:13:54,665 --> 01:13:56,859
I'm trying but their security system is locking us out.

920
01:13:56,983 --> 01:13:58,840
Listen, ladies and gentlemen...

921
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:00,450
Oh, there he is. These your dancers?

922
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,560
This is a party, baby!

923
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:07,957
Some of ya'll probably went to the bathroom

924
01:14:08,063 --> 01:14:10,477
and noticed that all the hairspray was missing.

925
01:14:10,594 --> 01:14:12,653
Yep. She did it.

926
01:14:12,766 --> 01:14:14,306
Thank you.

927
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:22,543
And we're so happy for you to be here.

928
01:14:22,657 --> 01:14:24,310
You look like you got some missiles underneath that dress.

929
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:25,793
He did not just...

930
01:14:25,867 --> 01:14:27,107
Did you just say that?

931
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:40,824
Shit! Not the gate!

932
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:44,575
Brian, faster!

933
01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:46,567
We're playing all the defense we can up here.

934
01:14:46,638 --> 01:14:48,358
But we're gonna lose, you gotta hurry up.

935
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,889
Thank god, you showed up.

936
01:14:55,643 --> 01:14:57,374
These parties bore me to death.

937
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:51,885
Guys get out of there right now.

938
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:53,543
You've got an army headed your way.

939
01:15:53,618 --> 01:15:54,923
Brian, get up! Forget it!

940
01:15:57,523 --> 01:15:58,686
Tej, we're taking the car.

941
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:04,593
This is what I do. Y'know what I'm sayin'?

942
01:16:12,243 --> 01:16:14,413
Letty, Letty, talk to me.

943
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,487
Are you okay?

944
01:16:16,453 --> 01:16:18,342
Guys I can't hold it. I'm losing the final gate.

945
01:16:18,422 --> 01:16:19,422
You gotta get out of there.

946
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,375
Tear off the dash!

947
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:22,677
Go through it.

948
01:16:27,797 --> 01:16:30,350
Wait, just hold on man.

949
01:16:42,422 --> 01:16:44,176
Time to unleash the beast.

950
01:17:05,863 --> 01:17:06,863
Go!

951
01:17:10,176 --> 01:17:11,456
Stay with me, I got you.

952
01:17:12,856 --> 01:17:13,856
Let's get the hell outta here.

953
01:17:55,075 --> 01:17:56,866
Dom. Cars don't fly!

954
01:17:58,382 --> 01:17:59,382
Cars don't fly!

955
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:01,665
Shit!

956
01:18:30,616 --> 01:18:31,616
No brakes!

957
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,640
What?

958
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:35,967
- No brakes! - Shit!

959
01:18:50,638 --> 01:18:51,638
No!

960
01:19:31,257 --> 01:19:32,257
- Got it! - Get out!

961
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,544
TORRES ETHIHAD Abu Dhabi

962
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:14,167
Still miss the bullets, Brian?

963
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,982
There they are, disaster.

964
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:56,634
I'm sorry.

965
01:20:56,772 --> 01:21:00,526
I get you an invite to the most exclusive party in Abu Dhabi.

966
01:21:00,838 --> 01:21:01,501
Zafar.

967
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:03,579
No, no, you steal the host's car.

968
01:21:04,356 --> 01:21:06,154
And you jump it between two buildings.

969
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:07,791
Actually, it was three buildings.

970
01:21:07,844 --> 01:21:11,585
Oh! Two, insult. Three, honor. My bad

971
01:21:11,737 --> 01:21:12,737
Wow, wow, wow.

972
01:21:12,761 --> 01:21:14,249
I have to say...

973
01:21:14,572 --> 01:21:19,650
You've got an interesting interpretation there of low key, Mr. Toretto.

974
01:21:20,413 --> 01:21:23,403
I thought we had an understanding.

975
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:26,177
Sometimes you have to play the hand you're dealt.

976
01:21:26,292 --> 01:21:28,829
That's why I prefer to be the dealer.

977
01:21:30,328 --> 01:21:31,328
Good night.

978
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:38,919
Kicked out of my own garage.

979
01:21:38,987 --> 01:21:39,987
This is great.

980
01:21:41,627 --> 01:21:42,993
May I?

981
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:46,015
Brian.

982
01:21:46,992 --> 01:21:48,111
Give it to him.

983
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:08,258
All that trouble for this little.... thing.

984
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:11,306
With all due respect, Dom...

985
01:22:11,569 --> 01:22:14,416
You really did great work back there. All of you.

986
01:22:15,003 --> 01:22:17,466
All of my men are now standing by...

987
01:22:17,467 --> 01:22:20,018
and are fully at your disposal.

988
01:22:25,077 --> 01:22:26,077
Your call.

989
01:22:28,273 --> 01:22:29,273
Ramsey.

990
01:22:32,743 --> 01:22:35,911
Fire it up, and find me Shaw.

991
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:42,904
Damn, this is crazy.

992
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:44,711
Thank you.

993
01:22:46,065 --> 01:22:47,562
Give me a second.

994
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:52,856
What is it doing now?

995
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,058
It's hunting.

996
01:22:54,926 --> 01:22:57,535
Hacking into the security cameras at Ethihad Towers.

997
01:22:57,621 --> 01:22:59,736
That's the last place we saw Shaw so that's where we start.

998
01:23:01,909 --> 01:23:02,909
That's him, right there.

999
01:23:04,138 --> 01:23:06,335
Wait. What are these numbers out here for?

1000
01:23:06,402 --> 01:23:08,391
It's biomapping Shaw's face.

1001
01:23:12,214 --> 01:23:13,939
It will run that against every camera...

1002
01:23:16,028 --> 01:23:17,708
Every audio device in this hemisphere.

1003
01:23:30,394 --> 01:23:32,482
Bingo. Looks like he's holed up here.

1004
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:34,319
That's perfect.

1005
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,813
Automated factory, no people. Lots of places to hide.

1006
01:23:36,921 --> 01:23:39,667
You just changed the face of manhunts forever.

1007
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:42,221
Congratulations.

1008
01:23:43,034 --> 01:23:45,728
Can I check my e-mail real quick?

1009
01:23:47,037 --> 01:23:48,537
Dawn's up in two hours.

1010
01:23:51,474 --> 01:23:53,138
We're gonna go take down Shaw then.

1011
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,202
Go get changed.

1012
01:24:00,006 --> 01:24:01,395
We should go now.

1013
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:04,670
Just you, your team and me.

1014
01:24:05,361 --> 01:24:07,087
I thought you said at dawn?

1015
01:24:07,205 --> 01:24:08,205
My guys are racers.

1016
01:24:08,296 --> 01:24:09,742
Best drivers in the world.

1017
01:24:10,019 --> 01:24:11,597
But they ain't killers.

1018
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:12,733
Told you he'd say that.

1019
01:24:12,835 --> 01:24:15,389
I know you too well, Dom, and I'm going with you.

1020
01:24:16,182 --> 01:24:18,770
Looks like we got a nice little hunting party.

1021
01:24:19,118 --> 01:24:20,808
Let's go bag a shadow.

1022
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:31,222
Ten clicks out, boys. Get ready to rock and roll.

1023
01:24:37,382 --> 01:24:38,899
Here we go. Weapons hot.

1024
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:02,153
You ready for this?

1025
01:25:02,226 --> 01:25:03,226
Yeah.

1026
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:35,015
I hope you're enjoying your last meal.

1027
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:43,455
This is it?

1028
01:25:44,175 --> 01:25:45,217
This is all you want?

1029
01:25:46,047 --> 01:25:47,592
A dozen men?

1030
01:25:48,324 --> 01:25:50,372
I think you'll find it's more than enough.

1031
01:26:04,601 --> 01:26:06,290
I'm ready to meet my maker.

1032
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:08,095
Are you?

1033
01:26:08,364 --> 01:26:10,957
What were you expecting, Toretto? Catch me off guard?

1034
01:26:12,219 --> 01:26:14,530
Me standing here, waving a white flag?

1035
01:26:15,053 --> 01:26:16,421
Have you ever heard the saying:

1036
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,021
"The enemy of my enemy...

1037
01:26:18,135 --> 01:26:19,720
is my friend"?

1038
01:26:20,881 --> 01:26:22,176
I don't have friends.

1039
01:26:22,973 --> 01:26:24,197
I got family.

1040
01:26:24,958 --> 01:26:28,054
Well, I got a lot of friends.

1041
01:26:42,013 --> 01:26:44,205
Keep your formation! Sheppard, clear one!

1042
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:45,434
Brian, leave it!

1043
01:27:59,968 --> 01:28:00,968
Get down!

1044
01:28:12,805 --> 01:28:13,805
I got you.

1045
01:28:37,156 --> 01:28:38,345
The God's Eye.

1046
01:28:58,087 --> 01:29:01,003
You didn't really think I was gonna walk in there naked, did you?

1047
01:29:03,242 --> 01:29:04,470
You got hit bad.

1048
01:29:05,156 --> 01:29:06,528
Look. Toretto.

1049
01:29:07,646 --> 01:29:09,373
I know you won't listen to me.

1050
01:29:10,062 --> 01:29:12,361
You're not gonna wanna hear what I have to say.

1051
01:29:13,124 --> 01:29:14,526
But the truth is...

1052
01:29:15,215 --> 01:29:16,658
you really ought to...

1053
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:19,660
try that Belgian ale, man.

1054
01:29:20,737 --> 01:29:21,930
It's something special.

1055
01:29:22,758 --> 01:29:23,878
Belgian ale, huh?

1056
01:29:27,512 --> 01:29:28,890
We gotta get you to a hospital.

1057
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:29,970
No, you're not.

1058
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:31,889
I carry my own health insurance.

1059
01:29:32,001 --> 01:29:37,590
SOCOM Medics on standby. They're already inbound.

1060
01:29:39,214 --> 01:29:40,289
Pull over, kid.

1061
01:29:55,012 --> 01:29:57,149
Dom, you got to protect Ramsey.

1062
01:29:57,298 --> 01:29:58,847
As long as she's alive,

1063
01:30:00,408 --> 01:30:02,501
she can lock them out of God's Eye and they know that.

1064
01:30:02,574 --> 01:30:05,389
That means, they're not gonna stop coming until they've got her.

1065
01:30:06,229 --> 01:30:07,678
And this time when they come...

1066
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:09,842
They're gonna come with everything they've got.

1067
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:11,750
I'm not leaving you.

1068
01:30:11,862 --> 01:30:12,918
You're not.

1069
01:30:13,646 --> 01:30:14,867
I'm leaving you.

1070
01:30:18,048 --> 01:30:19,293
Go now, Dom.

1071
01:30:33,674 --> 01:30:36,388
A war is coming to us whether we like it or not.

1072
01:30:37,509 --> 01:30:38,794
But if a war's coming...

1073
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:43,726
We're gonna face them on the streets we know best.

1074
01:30:49,585 --> 01:30:52,169
I'm all for winging it, but this is crazy, man.

1075
01:30:52,687 --> 01:30:55,224
We got mercenaries with some real heat on us.

1076
01:30:56,592 --> 01:30:58,046
I mean I ain't scared of nothing but...

1077
01:30:58,148 --> 01:30:59,642
..I don't even have a gun.

1078
01:31:00,967 --> 01:31:01,967
Gun?

1079
01:31:04,181 --> 01:31:05,697
We got a whole city.

1080
01:31:05,809 --> 01:31:07,260
And we may have more than that.

1081
01:31:07,367 --> 01:31:08,556
If they use God's Eye...

1082
01:31:08,665 --> 01:31:10,866
it will tap the cameras around to find our location.

1083
01:31:10,934 --> 01:31:12,809
Which means we could plant a virus.

1084
01:31:13,459 --> 01:31:15,116
And then break in when they access it.

1085
01:31:15,813 --> 01:31:18,255
So you're talking about hacking my hacking device.

1086
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:19,455
That's brilliant.

1087
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,729
Yeah, but there's one problem.

1088
01:31:21,838 --> 01:31:22,851
The signal strength.

1089
01:31:22,962 --> 01:31:26,319
We can't start a hack on them until they're within a two mile range.

1090
01:31:26,431 --> 01:31:28,122
- That's really close. - Close?

1091
01:31:28,265 --> 01:31:29,464
These guys are military.

1092
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:32,270
If they're within two miles of us, we already dead.

1093
01:31:32,379 --> 01:31:36,633
I don't know about y'all, but I didn't really plan on dying today.

1094
01:31:36,745 --> 01:31:38,647
Only one way to stay alive.

1095
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,325
We play keepaway with Ramsey.

1096
01:31:41,434 --> 01:31:42,154
What?

1097
01:31:42,268 --> 01:31:43,915
They can't hit us if we keep moving.

1098
01:31:43,992 --> 01:31:45,224
And I'll take Shaw.

1099
01:31:45,755 --> 01:31:48,953
So basically we're just gearing up for a big game of hot potato, huh?

1100
01:31:51,299 --> 01:31:53,651
Why does it feel like I'm not gonna see you again?

1101
01:32:07,203 --> 01:32:08,640
I'll come back for that.

1102
01:32:10,398 --> 01:32:11,398
Promise?

1103
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:15,238
Promise.

1104
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:36,314
Brian, are you okay?

1105
01:32:36,436 --> 01:32:37,599
M韆, listen to me.

1106
01:32:38,184 --> 01:32:39,803
Something's about to go down.

1107
01:32:40,418 --> 01:32:42,539
If you don't hear from me in 24 hours...

1108
01:32:45,141 --> 01:32:46,868
I need you to take Jack and move on.

1109
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:51,147
You understand?

1110
01:32:53,046 --> 01:32:54,053
You understand what I'm saying?

1111
01:32:55,161 --> 01:32:56,894
No I can't do that, Brian.

1112
01:32:57,619 --> 01:32:58,619
No, I can't.

1113
01:33:00,438 --> 01:33:01,733
We're gonna have another baby.

1114
01:33:03,067 --> 01:33:04,181
It's a little girl.

1115
01:33:07,229 --> 01:33:08,871
And she's going to need her father.

1116
01:33:08,973 --> 01:33:11,044
So you have to finish what you're doing...

1117
01:33:11,161 --> 01:33:12,522
and you have to come home to her.

1118
01:33:14,031 --> 01:33:15,491
You have to come home to us.

1119
01:33:17,209 --> 01:33:19,340
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

1120
01:33:19,859 --> 01:33:23,143
I was scared you'd be disappointed with domestic life.

1121
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:28,786
You know the best decision I ever made was stepping into that store...

1122
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:31,705
buying that first sandwich.

1123
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:36,406
It was such a bad s醤dwich.

1124
01:33:37,177 --> 01:33:38,547
I know.

1125
01:33:38,695 --> 01:33:39,771
But I ate a lot of 'em.

1126
01:33:49,492 --> 01:33:50,492
I love you, M韆.

1127
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:54,930
Don't do that.

1128
01:33:54,954 --> 01:33:55,954
What?

1129
01:33:56,568 --> 01:33:57,573
The way you said it. It's like goodbye.

1130
01:33:57,695 --> 01:33:58,975
Say something else.

1131
01:34:00,912 --> 01:34:02,738
Okay. Kiss Jack for me.

1132
01:34:05,513 --> 01:34:06,513
I will.

1133
01:34:13,251 --> 01:34:14,434
I love you, Brian.

1134
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:19,453
I love you, M韆.

1135
01:34:51,106 --> 01:34:53,054
One last ride.

1136
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:03,319
Boot up God's Eye, and find them.

1137
01:36:17,626 --> 01:36:18,626
I'm getting something.

1138
01:36:21,982 --> 01:36:23,997
I got a positive ID. It's Toretto.

1139
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,189
God's Eye is placing him at Hill and Seventh.

1140
01:36:31,845 --> 01:36:33,000
Should we follow him?

1141
01:36:33,184 --> 01:36:35,448
No. Let Shaw take care of him.

1142
01:36:35,558 --> 01:36:36,296
Find Ramsey.

1143
01:36:36,405 --> 01:36:37,470
Yes, sir.

1144
01:36:44,235 --> 01:36:46,257
I don't know why we gotta keep driving around like this.

1145
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:47,927
Why can't we just pull over somewhere...

1146
01:36:48,037 --> 01:36:50,881
park, gather our thoughts in like a bunker somewhere?

1147
01:36:50,994 --> 01:36:52,797
Because it does not work like that.

1148
01:36:52,947 --> 01:36:55,067
We gotta stick close enough to the bad guys...

1149
01:36:55,179 --> 01:36:57,156
in order to get in range for Ramsey to hack 'em...

1150
01:36:57,268 --> 01:37:00,152
but we gotta be mobile enough not to get shot like fish in a barrel.

1151
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:02,712
So do me a favor, focus on the mission, keep us from getting killed.

1152
01:37:04,918 --> 01:37:06,393
Got them. Target acquired.

1153
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:08,593
She's riding shotgun in a blue GT-R.

1154
01:37:16,955 --> 01:37:18,041
Guys, they're here.

1155
01:37:18,157 --> 01:37:19,413
How many cars?

1156
01:37:19,531 --> 01:37:20,254
None.

1157
01:37:20,367 --> 01:37:21,910
And that's kind of the problem.

1158
01:37:29,517 --> 01:37:30,871
Let's give them a tour.

1159
01:37:30,947 --> 01:37:32,142
Break on my mark.

1160
01:37:32,254 --> 01:37:34,349
Three, two, one.

1161
01:37:34,459 --> 01:37:35,459
Go!

1162
01:37:39,418 --> 01:37:40,476
Splitting up won't work.

1163
01:37:40,892 --> 01:37:42,504
You can't hide from God's Eye.

1164
01:37:46,668 --> 01:37:47,668
In range.

1165
01:37:48,035 --> 01:37:49,180
Ramsey, start the hack.

1166
01:37:49,294 --> 01:37:50,684
Initiating.

1167
01:37:51,777 --> 01:37:52,777
Now.

1168
01:37:54,968 --> 01:37:57,976
Sir, I think someone's trying to hack the system.

1169
01:37:58,053 --> 01:37:59,205
It's Ramsey.

1170
01:37:59,318 --> 01:38:00,906
Send in the predator!

1171
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:02,001
Take her out!

1172
01:38:02,025 --> 01:38:03,395
Releasing predator.

1173
01:38:35,344 --> 01:38:36,729
I think we lost the chopper.

1174
01:38:42,788 --> 01:38:44,514
I think we got bigger problems than that!

1175
01:38:46,595 --> 01:38:47,867
Oh, my God.

1176
01:38:50,181 --> 01:38:51,581
What are you doing?

1177
01:38:51,694 --> 01:38:52,694
Going old school!

1178
01:39:55,809 --> 01:39:56,809
PUBLIC PARKING

1179
01:40:14,251 --> 01:40:15,466
It's coming back around!

1180
01:40:28,405 --> 01:40:30,057
The predator's back on 'em.

1181
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:31,174
Ready missiles!

1182
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,250
Roger that.

1183
01:40:33,477 --> 01:40:34,477
Fire!

1184
01:40:35,802 --> 01:40:36,802
Shit!

1185
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,167
I need a lateral.

1186
01:40:48,277 --> 01:40:49,387
Rom, where are you?

1187
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:51,084
Running back! Charging in.

1188
01:41:09,728 --> 01:41:11,050
Meet me on Third and Spring.

1189
01:41:11,127 --> 01:41:12,127
You got it!

1190
01:41:19,107 --> 01:41:20,185
I'm halfway there.

1191
01:41:20,266 --> 01:41:21,814
Grab your computer and get in the window!

1192
01:41:21,889 --> 01:41:22,929
- Why? - Do it, now!

1193
01:41:28,329 --> 01:41:29,553
You gotta go! Right now!

1194
01:41:34,204 --> 01:41:35,204
Fire!

1195
01:41:45,708 --> 01:41:46,708
No!

1196
01:42:04,468 --> 01:42:05,468
He made it!

1197
01:42:11,361 --> 01:42:13,036
Can't believe we pullled that off!

1198
01:42:21,061 --> 01:42:22,297
Wait, we're still being hacked.

1199
01:42:22,411 --> 01:42:22,876
What?

1200
01:42:22,984 --> 01:42:24,503
God's Eye is still tracking Ramsey.

1201
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:26,151
Keep the drone in pursuit of her.

1202
01:42:26,259 --> 01:42:28,019
The signal has to be coming from somewhere.

1203
01:43:08,046 --> 01:43:09,553
Breaking news out of Los 羘geles tonight.

1204
01:43:09,664 --> 01:43:12,978
In what can only be described as vehicular warfare,

1205
01:43:13,054 --> 01:43:15,178
police are engaged in a high speed pursuit...

1206
01:43:17,595 --> 01:43:21,093
I got it. The piggyback in the hack off that satellite tower right there.

1207
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:22,238
Take it out!

1208
01:43:33,824 --> 01:43:34,836
Toretto.

1209
01:43:43,965 --> 01:43:46,338
Wait, what happened? We were almost there.

1210
01:43:47,027 --> 01:43:48,652
They've cut the signal. I can't finish the hack.

1211
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:49,626
What do you mean?

1212
01:43:51,811 --> 01:43:53,292
Brian, they took out the tower!

1213
01:43:58,022 --> 01:44:00,111
Dad, what's going on?

1214
01:44:01,776 --> 01:44:03,317
Daddy's gotta go to work.

1215
01:44:21,222 --> 01:44:22,624
Alright, baby girl.

1216
01:44:22,732 --> 01:44:24,353
Elena's gonna be here in a little bit.

1217
01:44:24,378 --> 01:44:25,811
You know our drill.

1218
01:44:25,911 --> 01:44:27,230
Give me three for the road.

1219
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,763
You thought this was gonna be a street fight?

1220
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:04,580
You're goddamn right it is.

1221
01:45:50,822 --> 01:45:52,003
There has to be another way.

1222
01:45:52,117 --> 01:45:55,396
Wait. I'm seeing half a dozen cell towers between Sixth and State.

1223
01:45:55,472 --> 01:45:58,178
Brian, if you can get to the top of any one of those buildings around there...

1224
01:45:58,293 --> 01:46:00,946
we can reroute the signal manually and finish the job.

1225
01:46:01,058 --> 01:46:02,058
I'm on it.

1226
01:46:05,165 --> 01:46:06,389
Sir, did you hear that?

1227
01:46:06,422 --> 01:46:08,253
O碈onner is on foot heading for a repeater.

1228
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:09,875
He's gonna try to reinitiate the hack.

1229
01:46:09,876 --> 01:46:11,552
Keep the drone on the girl.

1230
01:46:12,179 --> 01:46:13,211
Kiet.

1231
01:46:14,003 --> 01:46:16,160
O碈onner's on foot somewhere between Sixth and State.

1232
01:46:16,234 --> 01:46:17,541
Don't let him make it there.

1233
01:46:32,863 --> 01:46:34,021
Boys is on us!

1234
01:46:34,143 --> 01:46:35,613
And them boys ain't ready for this!

1235
01:46:40,075 --> 01:46:41,207
Shit!

1236
01:47:00,046 --> 01:47:01,795
First a tank, then a plane...

1237
01:47:01,904 --> 01:47:03,492
Now we got a spaceship?

1238
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:05,021
That's not a spaceship, that's a drone!

1239
01:47:05,133 --> 01:47:05,894
Oh it's a drone?

1240
01:47:06,005 --> 01:47:07,566
Now you gonna break it down and be articulate...

1241
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:09,854
like you already know what the hell is going on?

1242
01:47:09,935 --> 01:47:11,496
Shut your ass up and drive the car!

1243
01:47:18,192 --> 01:47:19,900
Letty, the football's on fire!

1244
01:47:19,981 --> 01:47:20,981
We need help!

1245
01:47:21,671 --> 01:47:22,978
Hang on! I'm coming!

1246
01:47:58,858 --> 01:48:00,656
Ramsey, get ready to go again.

1247
01:48:03,241 --> 01:48:04,553
Drone has missile lock.

1248
01:48:04,669 --> 01:48:05,669
Fire!

1249
01:48:15,582 --> 01:48:16,582
Target destroyed.

1250
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:24,055
Wait! God's Eye still has her.

1251
01:48:24,202 --> 01:48:25,202
How can that be?

1252
01:48:38,468 --> 01:48:41,570
Get up. Come on.

1253
01:48:42,403 --> 01:48:43,403
Let's go! Let's go.

1254
01:48:47,252 --> 01:48:48,692
They switched her under the bridge.

1255
01:48:49,128 --> 01:48:50,128
What?

1256
01:48:52,601 --> 01:48:54,889
You gotta get outta here, it's on your trail and it's coming fast.

1257
01:48:55,007 --> 01:48:55,649
Got it.

1258
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:58,461
So if this car goes south, who's coming to save us?

1259
01:48:58,883 --> 01:49:01,435
Save us, honey? We're it.

1260
01:49:01,507 --> 01:49:02,216
Where are they now?

1261
01:49:02,306 --> 01:49:03,957
Six blocks east, hauling ass.

1262
01:49:04,998 --> 01:49:06,481
Where we heading, Tej?

1263
01:49:06,629 --> 01:49:08,830
There's a service elevator past the maintenance center.

1264
01:49:08,908 --> 01:49:10,691
It will take you directly up to the repeater.

1265
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,198
Brian, you gotta hurry!

1266
01:51:13,163 --> 01:51:14,522
Too slow!

1267
01:51:29,568 --> 01:51:30,692
It's coming back.

1268
01:51:30,813 --> 01:51:31,897
We'll lose them in the tunnel.

1269
01:51:32,821 --> 01:51:33,821
Got it!

1270
01:51:33,845 --> 01:51:34,845
Fire!

1271
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:52,930
I can't shake this thing!

1272
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:57,536
The predator has missile lock.

1273
01:51:57,973 --> 01:51:58,973
Take it out!

1274
01:52:25,711 --> 01:52:26,711
No way.

1275
01:52:37,972 --> 01:52:40,014
Wait! What happened?

1276
01:52:40,121 --> 01:52:42,357
Sir, someone just double tapped our drone.

1277
01:52:42,517 --> 01:52:43,517
What?

1278
01:52:45,725 --> 01:52:48,313
Hey, did you bring the cavalry?

1279
01:52:48,631 --> 01:52:51,207
Woman, I am the cavalry.

1280
01:52:54,642 --> 01:52:55,972
Who is that?

1281
01:52:59,013 --> 01:53:00,130
That's Hobbs!

1282
01:53:09,217 --> 01:53:10,219
I'm at the repeater.

1283
01:53:10,339 --> 01:53:11,835
The access cable's in the base.

1284
01:53:11,943 --> 01:53:14,850
Just plug it into your phone and Ramsey will be back online.

1285
01:53:16,579 --> 01:53:17,716
Ramsey, go!

1286
01:53:21,871 --> 01:53:24,324
Brian did it. We're back in.

1287
01:53:28,526 --> 01:53:30,102
We've got God's Eye back.

1288
01:53:37,801 --> 01:53:39,773
- We lost the God's Eye! - What?

1289
01:53:40,102 --> 01:53:41,102
Shit!

1290
01:53:45,568 --> 01:53:47,881
Military's inbound. Three minutes and closing.

1291
01:53:47,947 --> 01:53:49,039
We need to get the hell outta here.

1292
01:53:51,383 --> 01:53:53,676
Tej, Roman, I'm on my way.

1293
01:53:53,791 --> 01:53:55,369
Alright, homie. I'll see you there.

1294
01:54:42,553 --> 01:54:43,986
I have eyes on Toretto.

1295
01:55:04,552 --> 01:55:05,745
Shaw's in the way.

1296
01:55:05,858 --> 01:55:08,143
Then it seems our friendship is at an end.

1297
01:55:08,725 --> 01:55:10,021
Do it.

1298
01:55:25,346 --> 01:55:27,026
The thing about street fights?

1299
01:55:29,801 --> 01:55:31,756
The street always wins.

1300
01:56:00,211 --> 01:56:01,398
Goodbye, Toretto.

1301
01:56:10,030 --> 01:56:11,828
Take him out!

1302
01:56:22,285 --> 01:56:23,285
Son of a...

1303
01:56:41,331 --> 01:56:42,331
I need some help out here!

1304
01:56:42,426 --> 01:56:44,082
We're getting killed.

1305
01:56:44,156 --> 01:56:45,845
I need some backup!

1306
01:56:54,758 --> 01:56:56,791
No! Son of a bitch.

1307
01:56:59,243 --> 01:57:00,253
He's getting away!

1308
01:57:00,358 --> 01:57:02,038
No, stop them.

1309
01:57:58,029 --> 01:57:59,029
Don't miss.

1310
01:58:32,739 --> 01:58:33,739
Dom!

1311
01:59:19,015 --> 01:59:20,015
Come on.

1312
01:59:20,266 --> 01:59:21,266
C'mon, buddy.

1313
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:27,110
Is he breathing?

1314
01:59:27,134 --> 01:59:29,047
Here's what I need you to do. Keep his head tilted up.

1315
01:59:29,117 --> 01:59:30,708
All right. Keep it back like this.

1316
01:59:31,101 --> 01:59:33,657
Clinch his nose, keep his head tilted. Breathe in him now. Go.

1317
01:59:34,035 --> 01:59:35,035
That's good.

1318
01:59:35,059 --> 01:59:35,883
Come on, Dom.

1319
01:59:35,964 --> 01:59:38,652
Come on, goddammit!

1320
01:59:38,767 --> 01:59:39,876
You come on, you breathe!

1321
01:59:39,993 --> 01:59:41,183
Go, go, breathe!

1322
01:59:41,330 --> 01:59:44,358
C'mon, dammit. Let's go. Come on, Dom! I need you to breathe.

1323
01:59:45,299 --> 01:59:47,116
Come on, Dom. Come back, c'mon.

1324
01:59:47,224 --> 01:59:48,884
Come on, buddy. Dom, come on!

1325
01:59:48,991 --> 01:59:50,283
Back off!

1326
01:59:50,393 --> 01:59:52,413
Will you stop? Breathe into him.

1327
01:59:52,487 --> 01:59:53,938
You breathe into him.

1328
01:59:54,052 --> 01:59:56,605
- You breathe into him. - Back off!

1329
01:59:58,058 --> 02:00:01,053
Please, please, Dom.

1330
02:00:01,638 --> 02:00:02,897
Dom, baby.

1331
02:00:02,974 --> 02:00:04,769
I know you're hurting right now.

1332
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:06,787
But I want you to listen.

1333
02:00:06,897 --> 02:00:10,183
Stay awake and focus on me.

1334
02:00:16,003 --> 02:00:18,271
I remember everything.

1335
02:00:19,741 --> 02:00:21,218
It came to me like a flood.

1336
02:00:24,181 --> 02:00:26,587
That night, in the Dominican Republic.

1337
02:00:28,023 --> 02:00:29,444
The night we got married.

1338
02:00:32,553 --> 02:00:33,839
Who has the ring?

1339
02:00:42,488 --> 02:00:43,709
Will this do?

1340
02:00:45,144 --> 02:00:47,517
With this silver necklace, love...

1341
02:00:47,671 --> 02:00:49,313
We have eternity in this moment.

1342
02:00:50,601 --> 02:00:53,186
You will never be alone again.

1343
02:00:53,258 --> 02:00:56,101
I vow, wherever you go, I go.

1344
02:00:56,254 --> 02:00:57,293
You ride, I ride.

1345
02:00:57,367 --> 02:00:59,631
You fight, I fight.

1346
02:00:59,779 --> 02:01:01,937
And if you ever die on me, Dominic Toretto...

1347
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:03,818
I'm gonna die with you.

1348
02:01:07,758 --> 02:01:08,758
I love you, Letty.

1349
02:01:08,782 --> 02:01:09,977
I will always love you.

1350
02:01:10,129 --> 02:01:12,827
If you die, I die.

1351
02:01:16,070 --> 02:01:18,482
And I'm not ready to leave this place yet.

1352
02:01:19,138 --> 02:01:21,944
This moment, still ours.

1353
02:01:26,489 --> 02:01:28,883
I remember everything.

1354
02:01:29,419 --> 02:01:31,557
I remember it all.

1355
02:01:33,777 --> 02:01:35,026
It's about time.

1356
02:01:43,619 --> 02:01:44,619
Oh, God.

1357
02:01:50,559 --> 02:01:52,546
Why didn't you tell me we were married?

1358
02:02:01,127 --> 02:02:03,661
Because you can't tell someone they love you.

1359
02:02:14,290 --> 02:02:15,671
Holy shit.

BLACK SITE --- CIA

1361

You sure you brought enough backup with you, Hobbs?

1362
02:02:45,591 --> 02:02:46,851
Oh, they ain't mine.

1363
02:02:48,043 --> 02:02:49,488
They're here to protect you.

1364
02:02:49,908 --> 02:02:51,792
From me killing your ass.

1365
02:03:08,723 --> 02:03:11,278
You do know, none of this will keep me, right?

1366
02:03:15,571 --> 02:03:18,642
Well I want you to dig through 38 feet of concrete and steel...

1367
02:03:18,643 --> 02:03:22,204
and my fist and a bodybag will be waiting for you on the other side.

1368
02:03:22,836 --> 02:03:25,301
So I suggest you get to digging, boy.

1369
02:04:02,202 --> 02:04:04,675
- Daddy, come play. - Yeah.

1370
02:04:04,823 --> 02:04:06,763
Look at him, look at him.

1371
02:04:09,496 --> 02:04:10,974
Yeah, buddy.

1372
02:04:12,133 --> 02:04:13,550
- Duty calls. - It does.

1373
02:04:13,664 --> 02:04:15,971
- Come on... - Let's get momma...

1374
02:04:16,052 --> 02:04:18,667
Y'know we gotta tan because...

1375
02:04:18,774 --> 02:04:20,840
the sun is out, you know...

1376
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:23,334
medium rare, but I can get like...

1377
02:04:23,441 --> 02:04:25,640
well done, like really dark.

1378
02:04:27,197 --> 02:04:29,958
- What you nudging me for? - Close your mouth for two seconds.

1379
02:04:31,536 --> 02:04:33,370
Just open your eyes, man.

1380
02:04:37,477 --> 02:04:38,477
Beautiful.

1381
02:04:40,025 --> 02:04:41,862
That's where he belongs.

1382
02:04:42,730 --> 02:04:43,787
Home.

1383
02:04:45,393 --> 02:04:47,664
Where he's always belonged.

1384
02:04:52,365 --> 02:04:54,740
Things are gonna be different now.

1385
02:05:04,067 --> 02:05:05,144
You got it. What...

1386
02:05:17,921 --> 02:05:20,053
One more time.

1387
02:05:21,895 --> 02:05:23,658
You aren't going to say goodbye?

1388
02:05:29,618 --> 02:05:31,467
Yeah! Good job!

1389
02:05:33,896 --> 02:05:34,896
My man.

1390
02:05:35,294 --> 02:05:36,872
It's never goodbye.

It's been a long day without you, my friend

1393
02:05:46,401 --> 02:05:51,466
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

1394
02:05:52,043 --> 02:05:57,546
We've come a long way from where we began

1395
02:05:57,654 --> 02:06:03,592
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

1396
02:06:03,731 --> 02:06:06,435
When I see you again

1397
02:06:09,856 --> 02:06:11,576
First you both go out your way

1398
02:06:11,726 --> 02:06:13,094
And the vibe is feeling strong

1399
02:06:13,166 --> 02:06:14,609
And what's small turn to a friendship

1400
02:06:14,723 --> 02:06:16,203
A friendship turn into a bond

1401
02:06:16,282 --> 02:06:17,724
And that bond will never be broken

1402
02:06:17,798 --> 02:06:20,536
And the love will never get lost

1403
02:06:21,873 --> 02:06:23,637
And when brotherhood come first

1404
02:06:23,743 --> 02:06:25,113
Then the line will never be crossed

1405
02:06:25,261 --> 02:06:26,559
Established it on our own

1406
02:06:26,705 --> 02:06:28,076
When that line had to be drawn

1407
02:06:28,186 --> 02:06:29,675
And that line is what we reach

1408
02:06:29,773 --> 02:06:31,213
So remember me when I'm gone

1409

When I see you again

Hey, thought you could leave without saying goodbye?

1414
02:06:56,322 --> 02:07:00,272
I used to say I lived my life a quarter mile at a time.

1415
02:07:01,141 --> 02:07:03,441
And I think that's why we were brothers.

1416
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:06,724
Because you did, too.

- What's happening, boy? - Thanks for the invite.

Wanna go for a drive?

1422

No matter where you are,

whether it's a quarter mile away,
