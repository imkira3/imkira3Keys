00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:54,094
Hello.

3
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:55,720
Hello, sweetie.

4
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,472
Daddy.

5
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:00,226
lt's early.

6
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,727
Yeah, l know.

7
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:04,479
l just wanted to let you know
l'm sending you something.

8
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,190
Does it smell nice?

9
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:10,068
No, but it's sparkly.

10
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:13,572
Does it have a receipt?

11
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:17,284
l'm sending it to you from the store.

12
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,789
Why don't you just come by?
We'll have some breakfast.

13
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:24,916
Well, it'd be a long trip.

14
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,836
l'm in Venice.

15
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,258
With your parole officer's approval,
of course.

16
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:35,677
Well, l like the guy, Stella,
you know that...

17
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,721
but we never really connected.

18
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:40,766
So l think l've paid my PO
his last visit.

19
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,393
What are you into, Dad?

20
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:45,228
Don't break my heart.
You told me you were through.

21
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:47,732
After this l am, l swear to you.

22
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,610
ls Charlie there?

23
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:53,570
l'm on a cell phone, darling.

24
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:56,323
l'll call you tomorrow from a landline.

25
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:59,660
l love you. Go back to sleep. Bye.

26
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:01,745
Dad?

27
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:07,793
l love you, too.

28
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:15,718
l sent it.

29
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:18,221
You're supposed to do your shopping
after we pull off the job.

30
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:20,972
-l feel so optimistic.
-Oh?

31
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:24,477
-How do you feel?
-l'm fine.

32
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:25,644
Fine?

33
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,438
You know what "fine" stands for,
don't you?

34
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:29,148
Yeah, unfortunately.

35
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:30,232
"Freaked out."

36
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:31,651
-"lnsecure."
-"Neurotic."

37
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:33,443
-And "emotional."
-Good.

38
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:35,696
See those columns behind you?

39
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:38,365
What about them?

40
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,160
That's where they used to string up
thieves who felt "fine."

41
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:43,996
Well, after you.

42
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,047
For after the haul.

43
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:55,799
Hope l get to fire it up.

44
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,594
-Still no word from the garbage men?
-No.

45
00:04:58,762 --> 00:04:59,887
lf they're a no-show...

46
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:01,346
it's three months of prep
down the tubes...

47
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,847
and l dragged you out of retirement
for nothing.

48
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:04,516
Oh, this is fun. l like this.

49
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:07,520
You taking over the reins,
and all the worries.

50
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:09,855
Me, loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

51
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,524
l'm glad you're enjoying yourself, John.

52
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:13,651
Just remember, a police boat
can get from the station...

53
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:14,734
to our position in seven.

54
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,737
That means you got four minutes
to work your magic.

55
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:20,116
No, you told me ten,
and you said l would have five.

56
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:21,742
When?

57
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:27,748
Do not be messing with me
right now, okay? l will kick your ass.

58
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,874
Oh, yeah?

59
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,376
Come on, take your best shot.
Come on.

60
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,501
What?

61
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,265
Come on. Let's go.

62
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:47,059
-What is it this time?
-Da Vinci.

63
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:49,895
-Architect. Engineer. Painter.
-Yeah, fascinating.

64
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,689
Hey, hey, look, look. Check this out.

65
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:55,568
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

66
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:58,904
Unlike you, my friend,
l don't need a guidebook.

67
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:01,824
-Can we go? Please?
-Right, guvnor.

68
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:05,703
Come along, make yourself useful.
Untie that line.

69
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:07,288
-Today.
-Yeah.

70
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:10,166
Yeah, Gilligan, if you don't mind.

71
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:49,331
-Are we set?
-Yeah.

72
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:50,623
l've enhanced the viewing matrix...

73
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:53,251
to track both the Cartesian coordinates
and three altitude angles...

74
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:54,752
the yaw, pitch and roll, to give us...

75
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:56,837
the exact position and orientation
of our baby.

76
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:59,131
We're in ltaly. Speak English.

77
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:00,800
Steve, how we looking?

78
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:04,304
Papa took the boat to work at 8:1 5,
so the garage is empty.

79
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,226
Mama left with daughter at 8:30
for preschool as usual.

80
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,811
So for the next 45 minutes...

81
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:13,897
we own this place, gentlemen.

82
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:15,773
Still no word from the garbage men?

83
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:18,359
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

84
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:20,653
They'll be there.
You can trust these guys.

85
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:23,155
Steve, how many times
do l have to tell you?

86
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,536
l trust everyone.
l just don't trust the devil inside them.

87
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:17,042
We're in.

88
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:36,228
Just tell me where to paint.

89
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,198
-Your men are still not in position?
-They will be.

90
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,617
But you don't know that, Steve.
We should abort.

91
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:53,413
l'm sorry, John,
but l think that's Charlie's call now.

92
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:02,214
Our baby's being taken out of here
tonight, and this is our only shot at it.

93
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:06,593
Charlie?

94
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:09,429
Keep going?

95
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:11,473
lt's up to you, kid.

96
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,433
lt's a go.

97
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:18,104
Okay, Steve.

98
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:23,360
From the west wall, measure 14'8".

99
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:25,153
Got it.

100
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:28,365
Now measure 8'5" from the north wall.

101
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:31,243
That's the northwest corner of our baby.

102
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:32,619
Got it.

103
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:33,954
Well, it's right above you.

104
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,530
Now, paint...

105
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,365
2'9" wide...

106
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,243
2'5" deep.

107
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,413
Okay, Left Ear, you're up.

108
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,000
14'4" from that west wall.

109
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:47,320
Yeah.

110
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,784
The garbage men are in position, John.

111
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,118
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

112
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,870
The police boat's heading your way.

113
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:04,165
Seven minutes and counting. Let's go.

114
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,832
We got four minutes to load and leave.
Let's go.

115
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,858
Hey, you guys, come here.

116
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:45,196
l want to propose a toast.

117
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:47,450
To us.

118
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:49,409
-Yeah!
-Right!

119
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,623
And l want to propose a toast
to Charlie...

120
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:58,001
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold...

121
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:01,880
without even holding a gun
because he planned this down to a T.

122
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,382
Nobody else could have done that.
Nobody.

123
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,260
-Charlie!
-Charlie!

124
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:08,470
Thank you.

125
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,389
So, come on, gentlemen.

126
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:13,266
Shopping lists. Who's doing what?
Spare no dirty details.

127
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,435
Come on, you guys.

128
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,645
Take a lesson from an old man.

129
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,897
Don't spend it. lnvest.

130
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:21,442
ln what?

131
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,194
ln gold.

132
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:28,657
Let's figure out how to
get out of here first, all right?

133
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,242
What are you getting, Rob?

134
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:33,787
l don't know, there's a lot of things
you can buy with a lot of money.

135
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:36,331
Now, l'm just thinking about
naked girls in leather seats.

136
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:37,958
Obviously. See?

137
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,544
l suppose l'd get
the Aston Martin Vanquish.

138
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:42,046
There's not a lot a girl won't do...

139
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,881
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

140
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:45,508
l'm going to get a NAD T770...

141
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,010
digital decoder with the 70-watt amps
and Burr-Brown DACs.

142
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,764
-Yeah.
-lt's a big stereo.

143
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:54,183
Speakers so loud
they blow women's clothes off.

144
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:55,975
Now you're talking.

145
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:59,145
$35 million, you can't get
more creative than that, man?

146
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:02,691
l'm going to Andalusia,
south of Spain, right there.

147
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:04,193
Get me a big house.

148
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,278
Get me a library full of first editions.

149
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,322
Get a room for my shoes.

150
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:10,365
What about you, Steve?

151
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:12,326
l don't know, l haven't decided yet.

152
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:13,618
You haven't decided yet?

153
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:16,038
Come on, man.
ls it the mountain air orjust....

154
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:19,333
l liked what you said.
l'll take one of each of yours.

155
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:24,130
-Well, two of everything for Steve, then.
-Two of those.

156
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:31,262
Loved the toast.

157
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:33,639
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

158
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:36,183
No, you were incredible.

159
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,601
Just incredible.

160
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:41,105
You saw the whole picture.
You covered all the angles.

161
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:43,649
You know, Charlie...

162
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:46,735
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

163
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:49,864
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives...

164
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,908
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

165
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,202
Don't be the latter.

166
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,331
Makes you miss out
on what's really important in this life.

167
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,042
What are you talking about, John?

168
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:03,544
You've been a good father.

169
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:06,756
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

170
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:09,758
l spent half my kid's life in prison.

171
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,929
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

172
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,808
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with...

173
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:19,935
and hold on to her forever.

174
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,270
Okay?

175
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,438
Hey.

176
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:24,983
Let's go. l'm freezing my ass off.

177
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,150
Yeah.

178
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,112
Steve's getting cold. You, too?

179
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:32,157
l'm all right.

180
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:36,285
l love you, kid. You did really great.

181
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:37,787
Thanks, John.

182
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:40,623
Let's go.

183
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:08,943
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

184
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:10,653
He was like Don Johnson.

185
00:21:10,695 --> 00:21:12,321
Oh, yeah, from Brixton.

186
00:21:12,364 --> 00:21:15,158
Yeah, but what do you know
about Brixton, eh?

187
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:23,499
Look at this idiot,
right in the middle of the road.

188
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,169
Who's that? What's this, what's this?

189
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:30,924
Who the hell are these guys?

190
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,845
-Hey!
-Take your hands off the wheel.

191
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,096
Steve!

192
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,850
Don't even think about it. Just do it.

193
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:49,067
No, no, no, John.

194
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,694
Steve, what the hell are you doing?

195
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:52,820
l made a few plans of my own.

196
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:58,242
There's nowhere you can go where we
won't find you, Steve, you know that.

197
00:21:58,326 --> 00:22:00,035
l think that's probably right, John.

198
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:01,871
Go! Go! Go!

199
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:46,726
Charlie.

200
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:50,980
We got to go, Charlie.

201
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:17,233
You always work in the dark?

202
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:20,070
Makes me feel like l'm alone.

203
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:24,909
Not bad. Not bad, Stella.

204
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:27,912
-Damn. Hurley couldn't crack that safe.
-Neither could Spears.

205
00:25:27,954 --> 00:25:29,663
Now you know who to call first.

206
00:25:29,748 --> 00:25:33,166
You're expensive, Stella. Those guys
cut us a break on subpoena jobs...

207
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,294
good will, community service.

208
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:38,589
l do it for the money, Paul.
l'll be sending you a bill.

209
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:42,426
-Don't you want to see what's inside?
-l never look inside.

210
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:43,719
Have a good day.

211
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:45,387
-Hey, George.
-Hi, Stella.

212
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:23,174
-How long to crack it?
-Four minutes and 43 seconds.

213
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:24,801
Oh! You're the man.

214
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:27,220
-What's on the lineup?
-Todd Milliken called.

215
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:30,599
He has a prototype combination lock
he wants you to test out.

216
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:34,186
He says he added
two false contact points on the tumbler.

217
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:37,398
l'll pretend to be stumped for a couple
of seconds, give him a thrill.

218
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:40,359
And there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

219
00:26:40,986 --> 00:26:43,195
He says you two know each other.

220
00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:48,200
Charlie Croker.

221
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:50,369
Hey, Stella.

222
00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:56,333
Didn't l tell you
l never want to see you again?

223
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:59,295
l think it was when you told me
how my father died...

224
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:02,715
right in front of your eyes,
after you pulled him in for one last job.

225
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:09,388
We found him, Stella.

226
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,390
He's in Los Angeles.

227
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:15,019
The gold bricks he stole from us had
a Balinese dancer stamped on them.

228
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:17,313
l just got word from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete...

229
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:19,481
that a gold dealer out in LA
has been buying those bricks.

230
00:27:19,524 --> 00:27:20,608
Yeah?

231
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,652
Well, how do you know it's him?

232
00:27:23,862 --> 00:27:25,863
Skinny Pete sent me this.

233
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:28,907
Steve changed his last name to Frezelli.

234
00:27:34,372 --> 00:27:36,123
Why are you telling me all of this?

235
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:38,834
Been checking out the databases
of some high-end safe companies.

236
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:40,628
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1 000...

237
00:27:40,712 --> 00:27:41,880
delivered to his home office.

238
00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:43,381
You don't install a Worthington 1 000...

239
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:45,215
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

240
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,425
No, you don't.

241
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:49,095
The problem now is no one in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

242
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:50,597
l need somebody l can trust.

243
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:53,641
Look, l'm a professional safe
and vault technician. l'm not a thief.

244
00:27:53,726 --> 00:27:55,726
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

245
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,228
John was like a father to me, too.

246
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,360
Look, l'm sorry, all right?

247
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:06,571
l just can't move on
until l've set things right.

248
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,911
l've moved on.

249
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:19,893
Come on, Charlie.

250
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:21,354
Come on.

251
00:29:27,737 --> 00:29:28,820
Hello.

252
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:31,990
l want to see the look on that man's face
when his gold is gone.

253
00:29:32,324 --> 00:29:35,160
He took my father from me.
l'm taking this.

254
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:40,999
She's in.

255
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,126
-And that's a good thing?
-lt's a very good thing.

256
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:45,377
She can crack the Worthington 1 000
without even flinching.

257
00:29:45,463 --> 00:29:48,173
l'm not sure having a civilian
on the crew's a good idea, Charlie.

258
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:50,508
She's got the skill
and she's got the motivation.

259
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:51,801
Exactly.

260
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:53,428
She's emotional.

261
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:55,472
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

262
00:29:55,514 --> 00:29:57,140
Look, don't kid yourself, all right?

263
00:29:57,183 --> 00:29:58,767
We're all emotional on this one.

264
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,101
Let's go.

265
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:04,022
-Are you ready?
-Of course l am.

266
00:30:06,024 --> 00:30:07,692
You're not ready.

267
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:33,343
That was quick.

268
00:30:34,678 --> 00:30:36,054
Where are they?

269
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:39,766
We're a little early. l didn't expect
us to get here quite that fast.

270
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:42,727
There. That's Lyle.

271
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:45,063
He's my computer genius.

272
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:51,986
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

273
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:53,530
At least that's how Lyle tells it.

274
00:30:55,074 --> 00:30:59,118
He said Shawn Fanning was his
roommate in college and stole his idea.

275
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:14,092
l think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

276
00:31:16,595 --> 00:31:17,679
Hey.

277
00:31:21,892 --> 00:31:23,143
You okay?

278
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,603
Yeah.

279
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:28,649
That's Left Ear.

280
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:31,110
Demolition and explosives.

281
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,820
When he was ten, he put one too many
M80s in the toilet bowl.

282
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:37,073
Whoa!

283
00:31:37,325 --> 00:31:40,034
Damn, that was cool.
How'd you do that?

284
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,119
What?

285
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:42,579
How'd you do that?

286
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:43,622
What?

287
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:46,291
l said, how did you do that?

288
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,458
What?

289
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:50,129
Lost the hearing in his right ear.

290
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:52,839
He's been blowing stuff up ever since.

291
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:58,137
Handsome Rob, premier wheelman.

292
00:31:58,262 --> 00:31:59,971
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles...

293
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:03,141
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

294
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:14,402
You know, he got 1 10 love letters
sent to his jail cell...

295
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:16,155
from women who saw him on the news.

296
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:28,834
And you?

297
00:32:29,044 --> 00:32:31,462
l never heard how you got your start.

298
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:32,545
Me?

299
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:36,342
Well, l've been a thief
since l had baby teeth.

300
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:38,719
Okay, you both know what to do.

301
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:41,055
Cough it up now.

302
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:49,354
Watch it, spaz!

303
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:52,315
Hey, what's your problem, man?

304
00:32:57,447 --> 00:32:59,239
-Hey, Charlie.
-Good to see you, man.

305
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:00,866
-You good?
-Yeah.

306
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:03,202
-Charlie Hustle.
-Good to see you.

307
00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:05,537
-Hello, Charlie.
-Rob, what's up? Good?

308
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:08,582
Guys, Stella Bridger.

309
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:10,501
Hi.

310
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:13,127
How you doing? Nice to meet you.

311
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:14,213
Phones?

312
00:33:14,297 --> 00:33:16,882
Yeah, they're all fresh and clean.
l got internal chips in them.

313
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:19,677
Please change them twice a day,
or we will get heat on line.

314
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:20,886
lDs?

315
00:33:23,723 --> 00:33:24,931
"James Hymen!"

316
00:33:25,015 --> 00:33:27,184
Come on, man.
One time, give me a cool name.

317
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:29,561
A hundred and forty pounds? Try 1 65.

318
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:31,605
-Try lifting some weights.
-Try lifting up these.

319
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,774
Guys, enough.
Come on, we leave tomorrow, all right?

320
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:34,900
Let's go.

321
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:36,235
Hey, Charlie....

322
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:39,780
Handsome, can you help him
with the bike?

323
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:42,741
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

324
00:34:12,105 --> 00:34:14,732
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide...

325
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:16,525
this joker picked Hollywood.

326
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,694
He's a punk, but he ain't stupid.

327
00:34:18,778 --> 00:34:20,237
All right.

328
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:22,448
We need to figure out a way
to get into Steve's house...

329
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,241
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

330
00:34:24,284 --> 00:34:26,035
l want audio surveillance on his phone.

331
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,786
Oh, yeah, l been wanting
to try something.

332
00:34:27,871 --> 00:34:29,955
l'll crack into the phone company's
remote monitoring system...

333
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,082
and fool it into thinking
there's a legal tap on the line.

334
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,710
Just reroute the digital copies
of the calls to our own listening post.

335
00:34:34,795 --> 00:34:36,962
l've been doing it to my ex for years.

336
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:38,130
How long?

337
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:39,298
No. How long will it take?

338
00:34:39,382 --> 00:34:41,133
Not how long
have you been doing it to your ex.

339
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:43,886
l'll burn through the night.
l'll have it running by morning.

340
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:47,139
Sorry l'm late.

341
00:34:47,223 --> 00:34:49,142
We gotta work on getting Steve
out of the house.

342
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:51,478
Stella, how much time will you need
with the Worthington?

343
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,396
-Five minutes flat.
-Don't be cocky, young lady.

344
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:57,566
lt's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

345
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,154
Got perspiration on your fingertips,
your heart's pounding in your ears...

346
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:03,238
whole different ballgame.

347
00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:06,867
l appreciate your concern. l'll be fine.

348
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:10,120
Look, just remember,
this is all the easy part, okay?

349
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:11,747
lt's the getaway that can get us caught.

350
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:14,416
-So what's the sketch?
-We drive to Union Station.

351
00:35:14,502 --> 00:35:16,460
The getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

352
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:18,378
We need to know exactly how long
it's gonna take...

353
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,547
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

354
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,039
Oh, great. Carson Security System.

355
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,708
How good is it?

356
00:35:56,209 --> 00:35:57,669
Carson's held an annual contest.

357
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,630
$50,000 to anybody
that can bypass the system.

358
00:36:00,714 --> 00:36:03,382
The who's who of ex-cons
always show up.

359
00:36:03,424 --> 00:36:06,136
Five years running, no one's been paid.

360
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:08,721
Okay, party people, here's the status.

361
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:10,472
lt's an anti-scaling fence.

362
00:36:10,557 --> 00:36:12,350
lt's hardened, electro-plated steel.

363
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:15,394
Yeah, l'm gonna have to paint that up
with some nitromin.

364
00:36:15,436 --> 00:36:18,064
-Security on the property?
-Got an armed guard here.

365
00:36:18,149 --> 00:36:20,608
Little rent-a-cop, with a 9mm on his hip.

366
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:22,068
But that booth...

367
00:36:22,153 --> 00:36:25,321
security booth look prime
for a chemical grenade.

368
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:28,740
Nitromin, chemical grenades,
that stuff's pretty hard to come by.

369
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:30,450
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

370
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,205
Shit.

371
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:37,792
This dude got dogs.

372
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:41,587
l don't do dogs.
l had a real bad experience, man.

373
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:46,009
-What happened?
-l had a bad experience.

374
00:36:46,093 --> 00:36:47,802
Damn it. l'm deaf!

375
00:37:02,776 --> 00:37:05,111
"You turn in your badge
and your weapon...." Oh, shoot.

376
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:08,990
"Turn in your badge and your weapon."

377
00:37:09,783 --> 00:37:10,992
Crush.

378
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:14,287
"l don't wanna see you
anywhere near this investigation."

379
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:17,624
"And turn in your badge
and your weapon."

380
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,459
"l don't want to see you
anywhere near this investigation."

381
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:24,005
Hey! lt's a green!

382
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:26,758
"Turn in your badge and your weapon."

383
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,842
Green!

384
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:30,720
"l don't want to see you
anywhere near this...." Oh.

385
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:33,389
"Turn in your badge and your weapon."

386
00:37:34,975 --> 00:37:36,935
Unbelievable.

387
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:50,740
There he is.

388
00:38:09,843 --> 00:38:11,511
Let's get to work.

389
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:17,850
lt's either bad traffic, peak traffic...

390
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,603
or slit-your-wrist traffic.

391
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:24,399
You know, five people died from
smoking, in between traffic lights today.

392
00:38:24,483 --> 00:38:26,651
Well, you know, they do have
the Metro Rail, Rob.

393
00:38:26,694 --> 00:38:27,987
We could always use that.

394
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:31,865
That'd be ideal for carrying
a ton of gold, wouldn't it, genius?

395
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,783
What's your guesstimate?

396
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:35,618
The last 20 times
l've done the journey...

397
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:39,123
you got an average of 32 minutes
and a top time of 50.

398
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:42,542
But, if we had green lights all the way,
we can do it in 14 minutes.

399
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:45,337
Wait, you couldn't get through traffic?

400
00:38:50,218 --> 00:38:53,470
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

401
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:57,724
Lyle?

402
00:38:59,143 --> 00:39:01,060
l'll see what l can do.

403
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:07,150
You're right on time.

404
00:39:12,574 --> 00:39:14,282
All these poor bastards out there...

405
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:18,244
putting their life savings in banks
and S&Ls and mutual funds.

406
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:20,414
What do they think,
when the collapse comes...

407
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:22,124
they can depend on the government?

408
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:23,459
l don't think so.

409
00:39:23,543 --> 00:39:25,961
-Are you taping me?
-Of course not.

410
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:29,547
l never tape you.
Come, look. See for yourself.

411
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,346
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings...

412
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:38,931
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

413
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:43,979
Like my cousin Mashkov always says,
"This is our only refuge, baby.

414
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:45,689
"Gold."

415
00:39:53,948 --> 00:39:56,532
Every time l look at these engravings....

416
00:39:56,617 --> 00:39:58,494
She's so beautiful.

417
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:02,206
-Where did you say you got these?
-l didn't.

418
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:10,964
A little walking around money.

419
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:22,351
l guess l'm not walking
as far as l thought.

420
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:25,062
l'm sorry. l can only buy two bricks
from you today.

421
00:40:25,145 --> 00:40:26,271
That wasn't the agreement.

422
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:28,732
What can l say? l'm just middleman.

423
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:30,901
l'll buy the other two from you
on Wednesday.

424
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:33,111
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

425
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:47,543
So, what does a man with
$35 million worth of gold do at night?

426
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:52,423
He watches his big-ass TV.

427
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:56,677
That's our in.

428
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:22,369
-Stella.
-Jesus!

429
00:41:23,122 --> 00:41:24,371
Charlie!

430
00:41:24,747 --> 00:41:28,041
-How did you get in here?
-Well, l knocked, but you didn't answer.

431
00:41:28,126 --> 00:41:31,378
-What, so you just let yourself in?
-l was just making sure you were okay.

432
00:41:31,463 --> 00:41:33,338
l apologize. l just....

433
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,966
Don't look.

434
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:41,054
Okay.

435
00:41:45,226 --> 00:41:47,102
You got a lot of stuff here.

436
00:41:47,187 --> 00:41:50,230
You know, your dad was old school.
Did the whole thing by touch.

437
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:53,025
That worked for him. This works for me.

438
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:55,903
Technology guarantees
speed and accuracy, you know.

439
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:59,532
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

440
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:02,118
Why the headphones?

441
00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:03,994
Just training myself.

442
00:42:04,245 --> 00:42:06,915
Ambient noises, you know, just in case.

443
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:11,793
What do you want, Charlie?

444
00:42:12,837 --> 00:42:16,089
We're gonna knock out Steve's cable,
and we need to send in a repairman.

445
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:18,133
To get your video blueprint
of the interior.

446
00:42:18,594 --> 00:42:19,676
Yep.

447
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,054
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

448
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:26,225
Except me.

449
00:42:29,855 --> 00:42:31,272
l'll do it, Charlie.

450
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,024
l'm in, all the way, whatever it takes.

451
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:38,278
All right. l'll set it up.

452
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:39,447
Okay.

453
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,033
You maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me...

454
00:42:43,117 --> 00:42:45,244
before l go back to my room?

455
00:42:46,788 --> 00:42:49,541
l should finish this stuff up, you know?

456
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,877
-Just get it all done tonight.
-Yeah.

457
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:56,296
-Sorry l scared you.
-lt's okay.

458
00:42:57,049 --> 00:42:58,424
Good night.

459
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:00,802
Bye.

460
00:43:02,304 --> 00:43:04,304
And then he's just the media darling.

461
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:05,931
He's on the cover of all the magazines.

462
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:08,308
l should've been on the cover
of Wired magazine.

463
00:43:08,351 --> 00:43:09,851
You know what he said? He said...

464
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:12,146
he named it Napster
because it was his nickname...

465
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:15,066
'cause of the nappy hair
under the hat, but he....

466
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:18,361
lt's 'cause l was napping
when he stole it from me.

467
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:20,405
He didn't even graduate.

468
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,866
l think it's time to move on, don't you?

469
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:27,327
They shut him down.
l wish they'd do the same to you.

470
00:43:28,831 --> 00:43:31,165
Yeah, here we go. Cable chick.

471
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:45,179
Becky. Nice name.

472
00:43:45,264 --> 00:43:46,889
l wonder what she calls the other one.

473
00:43:46,974 --> 00:43:50,852
And it's such a mystery
why you don't have a girlfriend, Lyle.

474
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:54,188
So, all we need is a service truck
like that one...

475
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,357
a work shirt like hers.

476
00:43:57,026 --> 00:44:00,361
-You think Stella can pull it off?
-l have my doubts.

477
00:44:00,446 --> 00:44:03,072
There's no talking to Charlie, though.

478
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:06,325
You think he's...

479
00:44:06,535 --> 00:44:08,786
mixing business with pleasure?

480
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,664
He should know better.
Only l'm allowed to do that.

481
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,003
Right. Where you going?

482
00:44:17,379 --> 00:44:19,881
Get a work shirt and a service truck.

483
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,350
Are you kidding me?

484
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:36,105
How does he do that?

485
00:44:36,649 --> 00:44:38,901
How do you do that?
What are you saying?

486
00:44:38,984 --> 00:44:40,526
Hey, how are you?

487
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:42,403
Oh, good. l'm good.

488
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,697
Nice to meet you, l'm Handsome Rob.

489
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:46,115
And you are?

490
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,077
Oh, my name's.... My name's Becky,
but it's written on my shirt.

491
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,121
Listen, l'm gonna need your shirt
and your truck.

492
00:44:52,206 --> 00:44:54,248
Perfect. l'll give them both to you.
Would you....

493
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,167
Would you like my virginity as well?

494
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:57,585
lf it's on the menu.

495
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,713
Oh, you're so witty.
Why don't you take advantage of me?

496
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:02,716
Yeah, you're not too bright, are you?

497
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:03,841
No.

498
00:45:03,926 --> 00:45:04,926
Perfect.

499
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:54,285
-What can l do for you, Mr. Frezelli?
-The cable's out.

500
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:55,912
The TV, the modem, everything.

501
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:58,874
Now get somebody up here
and tell them to hurry up.

502
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,549
-Netcom Cable, how can l help you?
-Hi, l'm up at 3320 East Skyway...

503
00:47:07,634 --> 00:47:09,927
and the cable's just gone out,
our modem, everything.

504
00:47:10,011 --> 00:47:13,764
Okay, let's see, sir. l have a
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00...

505
00:47:13,848 --> 00:47:16,850
-if that would be good.
-That's going to work. Thank you.

506
00:47:16,893 --> 00:47:19,436
Guard just called the cable company.

507
00:47:21,147 --> 00:47:22,981
What time's the appointment?

508
00:47:23,066 --> 00:47:24,900
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

509
00:47:33,827 --> 00:47:34,826
Hello.

510
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,663
Hi, l'm calling from Netcom Cable.
l understand your service is out...

511
00:47:37,747 --> 00:47:39,580
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

512
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,208
-Yes.
-Well, we have a technician...

513
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:44,419
working in your area who's finished with
an appointment earlier than expected.

514
00:47:44,504 --> 00:47:46,088
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

515
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:47,505
Sure, that'd be great.

516
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,051
All right, our technician will
see you then. Have a nice day.

517
00:47:52,595 --> 00:47:54,429
Here's all the paperwork you need.

518
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:57,391
Just get him to sign and date
at the bottom.

519
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,685
Let's check out the camera.

520
00:48:02,606 --> 00:48:05,315
Stella, you'll be going patriotic today.

521
00:48:08,611 --> 00:48:10,863
Make sure you walk slowly
or the image will streak.

522
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:13,407
-l'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

523
00:48:14,284 --> 00:48:17,619
Sorry. Couldn't pin the corsage
on my prom date, either.

524
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:20,747
-What, you had a prom date?
-lt was his cousin.

525
00:48:21,457 --> 00:48:23,959
There's cable lines in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom...

526
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:26,920
and a cable modem on the computer
in the office.

527
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:29,798
You need to locate the safe
in the office.

528
00:48:30,633 --> 00:48:31,758
Okay.

529
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:34,469
l just want you to know
l think you're very brave going in there.

530
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:36,221
l know it won't be easy.

531
00:48:36,306 --> 00:48:37,806
l second that.

532
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,643
lt's gonna be fine.

533
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:44,313
What?

534
00:48:44,648 --> 00:48:46,398
You know what "fine" stands for?

535
00:48:46,482 --> 00:48:47,901
"Freaked out, insecure...

536
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:50,110
-"neurotic and emotional."
-"Neurotic and emotional."

537
00:48:55,658 --> 00:48:57,534
-You'll be great.
-Yeah.

538
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:12,592
Good morning. Can l see some lD?

539
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:25,020
-Thanks for coming so soon.
-Hey, that's part of the job.

540
00:49:25,064 --> 00:49:26,396
All right.

541
00:49:57,721 --> 00:49:59,721
Aston Martin Vanquish.

542
00:50:00,057 --> 00:50:02,600
Looks like that bastard took my car.

543
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:08,106
Nasty-ass dogs.

544
00:50:09,232 --> 00:50:12,151
Hey!

545
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:14,362
Cease.

546
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:19,909
Relax. Jesus Christ.

547
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:23,788
Come on, they won't bother you now.

548
00:50:25,582 --> 00:50:26,748
Come on.

549
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:29,669
House.

550
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:31,963
Go on, get out of here.

551
00:50:37,261 --> 00:50:40,722
lt's okay, l'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

552
00:50:44,225 --> 00:50:45,767
Steve Frezelli.

553
00:50:47,563 --> 00:50:48,730
Becky.

554
00:50:52,276 --> 00:50:56,111
-You wanna show me that problem?
-Yeah, of course. This way.

555
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,283
-You have a really nice house.
-Yeah.

556
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:03,786
1 922. All the original tiles.

557
00:51:04,496 --> 00:51:08,750
Every stone in that courtyard
hauled from some monastery in Seville.

558
00:51:09,043 --> 00:51:10,793
What a tactic.

559
00:51:10,836 --> 00:51:14,172
Monastery.
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

560
00:51:14,673 --> 00:51:16,257
You don't seem impressed.

561
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:19,135
No, it's just that l don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks...

562
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:21,971
from one place to another
is quite that interesting, you know.

563
00:51:22,056 --> 00:51:24,140
lt doesn't quite do it for me.

564
00:51:24,391 --> 00:51:26,350
What does do it for you?

565
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:29,437
TVs.

566
00:51:30,064 --> 00:51:31,814
l have a monster TV.

567
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:34,025
Not working right now, but--

568
00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:37,195
But, you know, l should probably
check out the cable modem, you know.

569
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:39,614
Yeah? Yeah, right. Over here.

570
00:51:42,826 --> 00:51:46,163
l paid $30,000 to some punk kid
to put this system in.

571
00:51:46,246 --> 00:51:47,663
One day, it just goes out.

572
00:51:47,749 --> 00:51:50,208
Ought to have him strung up.

573
00:51:53,504 --> 00:51:54,712
Here we go.

574
00:51:54,797 --> 00:51:56,339
There's our baby.

575
00:51:58,093 --> 00:51:59,217
We got him.

576
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:02,846
-Got any wiring coming through here?
-There's no wiring in here.

577
00:52:05,557 --> 00:52:07,141
-Just right here?
-Yeah.

578
00:52:07,184 --> 00:52:08,351
No explanation, just....

579
00:52:08,436 --> 00:52:11,521
Look at that, that's my....
That's my NAD T770.

580
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,064
That's my stereo.

581
00:52:13,149 --> 00:52:14,315
l bet most of your customers...

582
00:52:14,358 --> 00:52:16,859
are pretty surprised when they go
to open the door for the cable man...

583
00:52:16,944 --> 00:52:19,654
-and find you standing there.
-Oh, yeah.

584
00:52:20,323 --> 00:52:21,823
He's hitting on her.

585
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,035
There's no problem here.
l should maybe just check the TVs.

586
00:52:26,704 --> 00:52:27,829
Okay.

587
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:32,458
You know what? End this shit right now.

588
00:52:32,543 --> 00:52:34,586
l'll blow this shit
right off the mountain right now.

589
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:36,045
No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

590
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:45,013
-l see you got the AVM processor.
-Only the best.

591
00:52:45,056 --> 00:52:46,557
Check the box.

592
00:52:52,063 --> 00:52:55,523
l'm just gonna reset your system.

593
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:59,485
Sometimes these things
just get jammed up, you know?

594
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,237
That should do it.

595
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,407
lt's fixed?

596
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:05,701
Turn her on, let's see.

597
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:06,826
Now.

598
00:53:09,622 --> 00:53:10,998
Japan's Nikkei index....

599
00:53:11,082 --> 00:53:12,166
lt's perfect.

600
00:53:17,254 --> 00:53:18,588
Becky, huh?

601
00:53:19,423 --> 00:53:21,132
Have we met before?

602
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:26,096
No, l don't think so.

603
00:53:26,597 --> 00:53:28,682
lf you can just sign there.

604
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:31,517
So, if l was to ask you out to dinner...

605
00:53:31,603 --> 00:53:34,604
would l be the first one
of your customers to ever do that?

606
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:37,191
What, you asked your
last cable repair guy out for a date?

607
00:53:37,275 --> 00:53:40,444
No, but the last one was, like,
300 pounds, had a handlebar mustache.

608
00:53:40,528 --> 00:53:42,196
You know, not really my type.

609
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,822
l don't think it's a good idea.

610
00:53:43,907 --> 00:53:46,074
What, is that, like,
some cable company rule?

611
00:53:46,117 --> 00:53:48,452
No, actually, it's just my rule.

612
00:53:49,287 --> 00:53:53,290
l don't go out with strange men.
l just met you five minutes ago.

613
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:56,335
So, l guess l have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know...

614
00:53:56,419 --> 00:53:59,253
till we get to know each other
well enough.

615
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:02,799
Have a nice day.

616
00:54:03,258 --> 00:54:05,302
Come on, l'll be a perfect gentleman,
l promise.

617
00:54:05,386 --> 00:54:07,136
l won't even ask you
for your phone number.

618
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:10,389
l'll just.... l'll meet you.
Anywhere you want to go.

619
00:54:11,183 --> 00:54:13,476
Come on, break your rule. Once.

620
00:54:15,938 --> 00:54:17,563
lt's just dinner.

621
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,571
ls that a yes?

622
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:37,084
Are you okay?

623
00:54:38,419 --> 00:54:39,503
Yeah.

624
00:54:40,713 --> 00:54:42,464
He touched my hand.

625
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:46,677
He came on to me.

626
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:52,266
Hey, at least l....

627
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,143
l created a window of opportunity, right?

628
00:54:57,355 --> 00:54:59,606
When he goes out Friday night,
we go in.

629
00:54:59,691 --> 00:55:01,525
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up...

630
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:03,860
we'll be long gone with that gold.

631
00:55:03,903 --> 00:55:05,028
Yeah.

632
00:55:06,823 --> 00:55:09,408
Make sure you shuffle them cards
this time, Left.

633
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:10,826
Hey, Lyle...

634
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:13,704
what's the distance
between the front door and the vault?

635
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:17,332
-You're dealing while my back's turned.
-You've got that loser's paranoia.

636
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:18,500
Lyle!

637
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:21,169
He only answers to "The Napster" now,
Charlie.

638
00:55:21,212 --> 00:55:23,423
No. l'm not calling you The Napster.

639
00:55:23,506 --> 00:55:25,340
Why not? You call him Left Ear.

640
00:55:25,383 --> 00:55:26,508
Well, l am.

641
00:55:26,552 --> 00:55:27,926
And him, Handsome Rob.

642
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:30,721
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

643
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:32,389
Well, you can call me The Napster.

644
00:55:32,473 --> 00:55:35,767
Come on, they were at the same college
at the same time.

645
00:55:35,852 --> 00:55:37,102
Why are you encouraging this?

646
00:55:37,186 --> 00:55:39,146
lt is a verifiable fact.

647
00:55:39,231 --> 00:55:42,065
He was my roommate,
he stole my ideas.

648
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:44,068
l am The Napster.

649
00:55:44,736 --> 00:55:46,611
All right. All right.

650
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:51,408
What is the distance between
the front door and the vault, Napster?

651
00:55:53,286 --> 00:55:55,913
lt's farther than you want to carry it.

652
00:55:56,247 --> 00:55:59,750
Yeah, but, so, how do we get the gold
from the vault to the getaway car?

653
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:02,337
How wide is the hallway, Napster?

654
00:56:07,592 --> 00:56:08,884
Six feet.

655
00:56:26,694 --> 00:56:28,654
Okay, you got your gold.

656
00:57:28,132 --> 00:57:30,758
Well, we need more cars
to handle the weight.

657
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:34,303
Looks like l'm gonna need some help
with the custom work, too.

658
00:57:34,346 --> 00:57:35,847
l know a man for the job.

659
00:57:35,973 --> 00:57:38,433
So l modified the camera
to include the LlDAR technology...

660
00:57:38,517 --> 00:57:41,853
so we can create
really hi-res digital maps.

661
00:57:41,895 --> 00:57:44,396
-Who's that?
-Rob's mechanic friend.

662
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:51,362
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey.

663
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:54,157
-Charlie, this is Wrench.
-Hey, what's up, man?

664
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:57,868
Rob tells me you got real talent.
We need some bodywork done.

665
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:01,497
We need to pack up to
2,700 pounds of cargo in these Minis...

666
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,124
with enough suspension
and horsepower...

667
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:05,293
to outrun anything chasing us.

668
00:58:05,377 --> 00:58:08,253
-2,700 pounds of what?
-Of whatever.

669
00:58:11,717 --> 00:58:13,885
So, what do l get
out of this mystery deal, man?

670
00:58:13,927 --> 00:58:15,178
$1 0,000.

671
00:58:17,181 --> 00:58:18,514
All right.

672
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,335
Hey, hey, hey.

673
00:58:47,252 --> 00:58:49,587
We didn't get a chance to meet yet.

674
00:58:49,671 --> 00:58:50,880
Wrench.

675
00:58:51,925 --> 00:58:54,884
-Ham and cheese.
-Oh, that's cold.

676
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:57,429
Damn, that's cold.

677
00:59:43,601 --> 00:59:46,770
You want all greens?
'Cause you got them.

678
00:59:46,813 --> 00:59:48,188
What you got?

679
00:59:48,273 --> 00:59:50,607
Welcome to LA's
Automated Traffic Surveillance...

680
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:52,525
and Control Operations Center.

681
00:59:52,609 --> 00:59:54,528
See, they use video feeds
from intersections...

682
00:59:54,612 --> 00:59:57,572
and specifically designed algorithms
to predict traffic conditions...

683
00:59:57,656 --> 01:00:01,118
and thereby control traffic lights.
So all l did was come up with my own...

684
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,080
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,
and now we own the place.

685
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:09,001
-You want to do a dry run?
-l thought you'd never ask.

686
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:12,336
See, red light? Green light.

687
01:00:17,926 --> 01:00:19,051
-Danielson?
-Yeah.

688
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:20,595
What's up with Grid 34?

689
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,929
Let's check it out.

690
01:00:22,348 --> 01:00:23,849
Hey, hey.

691
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:25,391
Oh, oops, did l....

692
01:00:25,476 --> 01:00:28,061
Oops, wow. But it's awesome.
ls that not awesome?

693
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:30,564
-Can you change it back now?
-Yeah.

694
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:37,487
Lights are working fine.

695
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,947
lt's just an accident.

696
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,075
That's good.

697
01:00:43,745 --> 01:00:46,579
-What are those?
-Unnecessary engine parts.

698
01:00:46,705 --> 01:00:50,167
l lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

699
01:00:50,209 --> 01:00:52,960
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

700
01:01:35,296 --> 01:01:38,131
You know what
l'm thinking about right now?

701
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,342
The look on Steve's face.

702
01:01:51,604 --> 01:01:53,814
-You're early.
-l'm in a hurry.

703
01:01:56,776 --> 01:01:58,944
Of course you know
that the Florida vote rigging...

704
01:01:58,986 --> 01:02:01,571
-was a ClA and mob operation.
-ls that so?

705
01:02:01,614 --> 01:02:04,408
Yeah, which is not so very different
from when your John F. Kennedy...

706
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:06,952
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

707
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:08,620
You're uncomfortable
that l mentioned it.

708
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:11,415
No, Yevhen,
l don't like making two trips.

709
01:02:11,457 --> 01:02:12,958
You Americans.

710
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,793
You love your heroes.

711
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:16,837
A holiday for Columbus?

712
01:02:17,922 --> 01:02:19,715
He makes the wrong turn...

713
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:22,426
and wipes out
an entire indigenous people.

714
01:02:22,468 --> 01:02:25,637
-And you know what he was looking for?
-l bet you're gonna tell me.

715
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,140
Gold. Supposedly for Queen lsabella...

716
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:30,225
but don't think that the Medicis
back in ltaly...

717
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:32,018
didn't want a part of that action.

718
01:02:32,103 --> 01:02:34,146
And what did ltaly need gold for?

719
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,441
For the long-distance slave trade
based in Venice.

720
01:02:38,484 --> 01:02:41,070
Venice, that's where these bricks....

721
01:02:46,909 --> 01:02:49,704
-You were saying something?
-Nothing. No.

722
01:02:49,788 --> 01:02:52,622
No, you were really on a roll there.
Don't stop. l'm interested.

723
01:02:52,665 --> 01:02:55,125
Please, l'm confused. My English is--

724
01:02:56,419 --> 01:02:57,502
You understand fine.

725
01:02:57,545 --> 01:02:59,671
-Now, what do you know about my gold?
-No, l don't--

726
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:02,132
Don't you even think about lying to me.

727
01:03:02,426 --> 01:03:07,053
Okay, okay, l heard a rumor
about a heist in Venice.

728
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:09,848
$35 million in bricks...

729
01:03:09,932 --> 01:03:12,184
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

730
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:13,935
-Who have you told?
-No one.

731
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,980
-Who have you told?
-No one! l swear to God!

732
01:03:18,649 --> 01:03:20,275
You swear to God?

733
01:03:20,526 --> 01:03:22,861
You crazy? l swear to God.

734
01:03:22,904 --> 01:03:24,196
l didn't.

735
01:03:24,947 --> 01:03:27,365
Well, then, l guess l believe you.

736
01:03:56,103 --> 01:04:00,941
Yevhen.

737
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:20,419
Let's putt it this time.

738
01:04:20,628 --> 01:04:22,254
Putt, not drive.

739
01:04:23,172 --> 01:04:24,423
Very good.

740
01:04:24,508 --> 01:04:27,801
lf you can just get it....
l know you can, l know you can do it.

741
01:04:27,885 --> 01:04:28,970
Much better.

742
01:04:29,054 --> 01:04:30,178
l'm here to see Skinny Pete.

743
01:04:30,263 --> 01:04:31,264
That was great.

744
01:04:31,348 --> 01:04:33,891
-Yeah, he's over there.
-Thanks, man.

745
01:04:36,602 --> 01:04:38,062
-Don't stare.
-Huh?

746
01:04:38,105 --> 01:04:40,439
Don't stare. He doesn't like it
when people stare at him.

747
01:04:40,482 --> 01:04:41,983
Stare at what?

748
01:04:42,442 --> 01:04:44,110
That was good. That was good.

749
01:04:44,194 --> 01:04:46,696
Try that one.
l know you're gonna get that one.

750
01:04:47,364 --> 01:04:48,781
That was great.

751
01:04:48,824 --> 01:04:50,949
-Skinny Pete.
-Yo, Charlie.

752
01:04:51,034 --> 01:04:53,326
What's up, man? How's it going?

753
01:04:53,787 --> 01:04:55,913
So was l right about the gold bricks
or what?

754
01:04:55,956 --> 01:04:57,707
Oh, l'm not here to talk about that.

755
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,458
We need some supplies.

756
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:01,627
Baby, go relax.

757
01:05:01,712 --> 01:05:03,963
-Baby--
-Go relax.

758
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:12,889
Yo.

759
01:05:13,682 --> 01:05:14,807
Supplies.

760
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:16,434
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

761
01:05:18,395 --> 01:05:20,897
Some, some nitromin.

762
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:23,481
Some...

763
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:26,319
some nitromin, primer....

764
01:05:26,403 --> 01:05:27,653
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

765
01:05:27,696 --> 01:05:28,738
Yo.

766
01:05:28,822 --> 01:05:30,615
Nothing. l'm cool, l'm great.

767
01:05:30,657 --> 01:05:33,868
-l just need some, a big can of--
-Nitromin, primer...

768
01:05:33,952 --> 01:05:35,369
-detonating cord...
-Right, right.

769
01:05:35,454 --> 01:05:37,580
...two triple-charger chemical grenades,
and a launcher.

770
01:05:37,664 --> 01:05:40,666
Right, like l had,
you know, told you earlier.

771
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:42,001
All right.

772
01:05:47,966 --> 01:05:49,926
Cost you about 5 G's.

773
01:05:50,427 --> 01:05:51,928
Done. Call me.

774
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:54,680
Thanks, man. l'm sorry about that.

775
01:05:54,723 --> 01:05:56,265
All right, man.

776
01:05:56,725 --> 01:05:58,351
-Peace.
-Come on.

777
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:17,119
Get out.

778
01:06:18,622 --> 01:06:19,790
There.

779
01:06:28,716 --> 01:06:31,009
Vance has something to tell you.

780
01:06:34,138 --> 01:06:35,304
Go on.

781
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:39,685
A couple weeks back...

782
01:06:40,894 --> 01:06:43,730
l was working counter
of your cousin's shop.

783
01:06:43,815 --> 01:06:47,984
A guy come in asking about gold bricks
with Balinese dancer on them.

784
01:06:48,403 --> 01:06:50,277
What did you tell him?

785
01:06:51,781 --> 01:06:54,407
l told him that l'd seen the bricks.

786
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:00,414
l'm sorry.

787
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,209
What did this man look like?

788
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,587
He had long black hair...

789
01:07:08,923 --> 01:07:10,882
big tattoo on his neck.

790
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:15,720
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

791
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:17,764
l know that guy.

792
01:07:46,043 --> 01:07:47,585
Baby, go relax.

793
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,932
Do you know who l am?

794
01:08:01,141 --> 01:08:02,641
You're Mashkov.

795
01:08:03,477 --> 01:08:04,936
That's right.

796
01:08:05,062 --> 01:08:09,065
You were asking about gold bricks
with a Balinese dancer on them.

797
01:08:10,193 --> 01:08:11,610
Tell me why.

798
01:08:19,494 --> 01:08:22,662
Steve just called to confirm
his 8:00 reservation at the Water Grill.

799
01:08:22,747 --> 01:08:27,000
-Okay, let's go over it one more time.
-Gas the guards, doors open 8:1 5.

800
01:08:27,043 --> 01:08:28,794
Safe popped by 8:25.

801
01:08:28,836 --> 01:08:31,254
Loaded by 8:35, out the door by 8:45.

802
01:08:31,338 --> 01:08:32,798
Straight to Union Station.

803
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,217
Only green lights on your route.
The rest of the city's red.

804
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,177
Cops are stuck in the traffic
like everyone else.

805
01:08:37,261 --> 01:08:40,430
Train leaves at 1 0:00.
Cars have to be on the carrier by 9:30.

806
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:42,933
Timing's got to be dead on.

807
01:08:43,017 --> 01:08:44,142
Let's get ready.

808
01:08:44,185 --> 01:08:45,685
Let's get it.

809
01:09:16,634 --> 01:09:18,593
Wow, that is a nice car.

810
01:09:19,387 --> 01:09:20,720
Sorry, Rob.

811
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,722
Coast is clear, guys.

812
01:09:34,027 --> 01:09:36,445
This is it, guys. Moment of truth.

813
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,657
What the hell is this?

814
01:09:41,409 --> 01:09:42,450
Shit!

815
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:45,620
Steve's neighbor's throwing a party.

816
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:51,251
-Are you here for the Baker party, sir?
-No.

817
01:09:54,547 --> 01:09:56,756
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

818
01:09:56,799 --> 01:09:58,466
Too many witnesses.

819
01:09:58,551 --> 01:09:59,759
Stella.

820
01:10:00,136 --> 01:10:01,678
l know, l know.

821
01:10:03,848 --> 01:10:05,640
l'm late for my date.

822
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:07,934
Yeah, and you gotta be charming.

823
01:10:08,519 --> 01:10:10,437
We'll need him to ask you out again.

824
01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:11,646
Sorry.

825
01:10:11,772 --> 01:10:13,900
You need to get out of the street.

826
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:20,614
l really can't imagine you doing that.

827
01:10:20,698 --> 01:10:22,366
What's that supposed to mean?

828
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:26,412
Well, you don't really seem like
the adventurous type, you know?

829
01:10:27,455 --> 01:10:30,625
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

830
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:33,043
Well, l wasn't making assumptions.

831
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:35,587
Well, l've made some assumptions
about you.

832
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,005
Oh, really.

833
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,633
And?

834
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,429
Oh, well, we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

835
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,521
Why wait? Let's get a check.

836
01:10:52,606 --> 01:10:54,564
Let's go back to my place.
No assumptions....

837
01:10:54,649 --> 01:10:56,025
Not tonight.

838
01:10:56,275 --> 01:10:58,402
lt's late. l should go home.

839
01:10:58,778 --> 01:11:00,987
What, do you have
a cable company curfew?

840
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:04,324
No, but l've made some bad calls
in the past.

841
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:06,493
Hey.

842
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:08,995
We should take this
maybe a little slow, you know?

843
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,582
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation...

844
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:14,085
-you still don't trust me?
-Oh, no.

845
01:11:14,753 --> 01:11:16,379
l trust everyone.

846
01:11:16,713 --> 01:11:19,507
lt's the devil inside them l don't trust.

847
01:11:24,178 --> 01:11:26,180
That's an interesting saying.

848
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:29,016
lt's charming. Where'd you pick that up?

849
01:11:29,101 --> 01:11:31,060
-Can't remember.
-Really?

850
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,105
l knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

851
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:35,690
-Really?
-Yeah.

852
01:11:36,233 --> 01:11:38,067
He's the only person
l've ever heard say that.

853
01:11:38,151 --> 01:11:41,404
He said it all the time.
His name was John Bridger.

854
01:11:43,197 --> 01:11:44,615
You're hurting my wrist.

855
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:47,618
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

856
01:11:51,248 --> 01:11:52,999
Let go of my wrist.

857
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,751
l knew there was something
familiar about you.

858
01:11:55,835 --> 01:11:58,004
You're exactly like your old man,
you know that?

859
01:11:58,046 --> 01:12:00,715
l liked him, too, right from the start.

860
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:04,010
l liked him right up until
the minute l shot him.

861
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,471
Who are you working with?

862
01:12:12,936 --> 01:12:14,437
She's with us.

863
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:27,408
Gang's all here.

864
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:30,453
You know the only thing worse
than a thief, Bendel?

865
01:12:30,996 --> 01:12:32,246
A coward.

866
01:12:32,664 --> 01:12:35,750
Then you should have seen the way
your daddy begged for his life.

867
01:12:38,295 --> 01:12:40,921
-lt's not worth it.
-Put a leash on your cat.

868
01:12:46,303 --> 01:12:48,095
-Hi, Steve.
-Charlie.

869
01:12:50,682 --> 01:12:53,309
Not bad, Charlie. Really, not bad.

870
01:12:53,518 --> 01:12:55,437
You have no idea
how hard it is for me...

871
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:58,356
not to reach across this table
and kill you with my bare hands.

872
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,858
You know better than that, Charlie.

873
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,693
Can't let emotion into these things.

874
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,112
Tell me it wasn't about emotion...

875
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:05,905
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

876
01:13:05,947 --> 01:13:07,865
That wasn't about emotion.

877
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:09,701
lt was about a lot of gold,
and l wanted it.

878
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,786
Anything you think you deserved,
you didn't.

879
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:14,163
Hey, don't talk about right and wrong
with me, man...

880
01:13:14,247 --> 01:13:16,041
'cause l just don't give a shit.

881
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,208
Okay?

882
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:19,794
You've got your cards, l got my cards...

883
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:22,464
we made our play,
and l came out on top, okay?

884
01:13:22,507 --> 01:13:24,800
Now if you want to start
the game up again...

885
01:13:24,884 --> 01:13:26,634
that's fine with me.

886
01:13:27,386 --> 01:13:30,305
What.... l mean,
what is your play here, really?

887
01:13:30,764 --> 01:13:33,265
l mean, come on, what do you think?

888
01:13:33,476 --> 01:13:36,143
You'll try to take out my guards, right?

889
01:13:36,228 --> 01:13:38,687
l have five of them
that you don't know about.

890
01:13:39,231 --> 01:13:41,023
You'll try to have Lyle hack the system...

891
01:13:41,108 --> 01:13:42,817
but l'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

892
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:45,194
And what was your final move?

893
01:13:45,278 --> 01:13:47,530
l mean, you were gonna have
Bridger's daughter come in...

894
01:13:47,614 --> 01:13:49,615
and try to crack my safe?

895
01:13:50,409 --> 01:13:52,410
l mean, that's very poetic and all...

896
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:54,537
but l just don't see it.

897
01:13:54,621 --> 01:13:56,415
l don't think she'll get anywhere near it.

898
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:59,668
Same old Steve, huh?
Always thinking defensively.

899
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,962
That's why you're always number two.

900
01:14:02,462 --> 01:14:05,631
-How do you figure that?
-You've got no imagination.

901
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,801
Couldn't even decide what to do
with all that money.

902
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:09,510
You had to buy
what everybody else wanted.

903
01:14:09,553 --> 01:14:11,846
Oh, well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

904
01:14:11,888 --> 01:14:13,932
That gold is already gone.

905
01:14:14,474 --> 01:14:16,934
-That's bullshit, Steve.
-No, really, it's over, Charlie.

906
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,228
l'm trying to move the last two bricks.

907
01:14:19,312 --> 01:14:21,564
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

908
01:14:21,648 --> 01:14:23,733
l mean, really, be my guest.

909
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:26,069
Really. But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

910
01:14:26,154 --> 01:14:28,321
'Cause you just blew
the best thing you had going for you.

911
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,156
You just blew the element of surprise.

912
01:14:34,161 --> 01:14:35,454
Surprised?

913
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:41,126
lt's over when l say it's over.

914
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:46,006
Are you all right, sir?

915
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:19,206
How you doing?

916
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,417
Good.

917
01:15:23,961 --> 01:15:25,462
Considering....

918
01:15:26,797 --> 01:15:28,882
Considering the fact
that l'm doing all of this...

919
01:15:28,925 --> 01:15:30,926
for a man l barely knew.

920
01:15:37,642 --> 01:15:40,936
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

921
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,605
lt was that...

922
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:48,318
whenever he'd call me to tell me
that he was on some job...

923
01:15:48,486 --> 01:15:51,112
l knew you were right there with him.

924
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:58,203
You got to know him
a lot better than l did.

925
01:15:59,914 --> 01:16:01,289
Just 'cause he was around me more...

926
01:16:01,332 --> 01:16:03,416
doesn't mean he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

927
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:05,335
Be nice if it was true.

928
01:16:05,586 --> 01:16:07,003
lt is true.

929
01:16:07,088 --> 01:16:10,465
He always regretted not having been
a good enough father to you, Stella.

930
01:16:14,011 --> 01:16:15,470
How do you know that?

931
01:16:15,888 --> 01:16:17,557
Because he told me.

932
01:16:24,564 --> 01:16:26,773
What did you do to your hand?

933
01:16:29,777 --> 01:16:31,361
l punched Steve.

934
01:16:31,946 --> 01:16:34,823
And why do you get to punch him
and l don't?

935
01:16:37,327 --> 01:16:39,745
'Cause those hands
are way too valuable.

936
01:16:46,752 --> 01:16:47,836
Hey.

937
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:55,093
You okay?

938
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:07,022
There'll be nothing left of that
if you keep rubbing it.

939
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:15,406
Tell Mr. Frezelli we'll see him at 8:00.

940
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:16,698
Charlie!

941
01:17:19,536 --> 01:17:21,369
He's flying the coop.

942
01:17:21,955 --> 01:17:23,038
When?

943
01:17:23,457 --> 01:17:26,667
His security guard called
for a private helicopter at 4:00 p.m.

944
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:29,336
There is an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

945
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:33,132
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 p.m...

946
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,717
to Mexico City.

947
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,552
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

948
01:17:37,596 --> 01:17:39,763
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

949
01:17:39,847 --> 01:17:42,223
Steve's not about to let that gold
out of his sight.

950
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:44,185
lt's gonna be in that truck
and he's gonna be watching it...

951
01:17:44,227 --> 01:17:45,728
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

952
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:47,812
-So the gold's headed to Mexico.
-Well, who knows where?

953
01:17:47,898 --> 01:17:49,314
They could change the flight plan
in midair.

954
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:50,441
Slow down, slow down.

955
01:17:50,525 --> 01:17:52,026
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

956
01:17:52,069 --> 01:17:53,234
This is good news for us.

957
01:17:53,319 --> 01:17:54,986
Charlie, what do you mean
"good news"?

958
01:17:55,072 --> 01:17:56,989
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe...

959
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:58,156
now the safe is coming to us.

960
01:17:58,241 --> 01:17:59,741
We're gonna boost it in transit.

961
01:17:59,785 --> 01:18:02,077
Charlie, he could take
a dozen different routes to the airport.

962
01:18:02,162 --> 01:18:03,703
We have no idea which one.

963
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:06,207
We can't take out an armored truck
during rush hour.

964
01:18:06,249 --> 01:18:07,750
We're already set up to do it.

965
01:18:07,793 --> 01:18:09,125
Napster...

966
01:18:09,877 --> 01:18:12,170
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

967
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:14,631
Force that truck to go exactly
where we want it to go.

968
01:18:14,715 --> 01:18:16,509
Where do we want it to go?

969
01:18:16,593 --> 01:18:18,928
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards, we'd lose.

970
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,222
l'm gonna do it like the ltalian job.

971
01:18:27,938 --> 01:18:29,939
-Hello.
-Why'd you do it?

972
01:18:29,981 --> 01:18:31,482
-Do what?
-Yevhen.

973
01:18:31,566 --> 01:18:33,109
You didn't have to clip him.

974
01:18:33,151 --> 01:18:35,611
Whoa, whoa, what are you talking
about? We didn't clip anybody.

975
01:18:35,654 --> 01:18:39,031
Well, Yevhen's cousin is under
the distinct impression that you did.

976
01:18:39,116 --> 01:18:40,408
Why does he think that?

977
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:43,744
Because you wanted to know
about the gold with the Balinese dancer.

978
01:18:43,787 --> 01:18:46,205
-You told him that?
-Listen to me, man.

979
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:49,959
lf there's one thing that l know,
is never to mess with Mother Nature...

980
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:52,877
mother-in-laws
or mother-freaking Ukrainians.

981
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,673
Look, l need a favor.

982
01:19:22,784 --> 01:19:24,618
-Yeah.
-Had a hiccup last night.

983
01:19:24,661 --> 01:19:26,912
Could use some help.
More hands-on this time.

984
01:19:26,997 --> 01:19:29,081
-You interested?
-Could be.

985
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:33,461
But l don't like to be kept in the dark.
lf l'm in, l'm in.

986
01:19:33,837 --> 01:19:35,921
Okay, you're in.

987
01:19:36,089 --> 01:19:37,506
All right.

988
01:19:40,552 --> 01:19:43,929
-What do you think, Charlie?
-This'll work. Let's go.

989
01:19:55,066 --> 01:19:57,777
You're amazing. lt's a work of genius.

990
01:20:07,788 --> 01:20:09,039
You okay?

991
01:20:09,372 --> 01:20:11,582
-Yeah, just give me a moment.
-Now?

992
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:15,711
l'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube...

993
01:20:15,796 --> 01:20:17,588
and if the brass touches the sides...

994
01:20:17,672 --> 01:20:20,466
we'll both be the last people
we ever see.

995
01:20:22,512 --> 01:20:24,595
Take all the time you need.

996
01:20:27,599 --> 01:20:29,643
-Hey, Charlie.
-What?

997
01:20:32,146 --> 01:20:33,730
l love you, man.

998
01:20:36,108 --> 01:20:37,734
l love you, too.

999
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:43,198
Okay.

1000
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,751
Your attention, please.

1001
01:20:55,795 --> 01:20:59,798
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive in approximately 15 minutes.

1002
01:21:17,023 --> 01:21:18,275
Check positions.

1003
01:21:18,317 --> 01:21:19,483
Napster?

1004
01:21:19,569 --> 01:21:20,985
l'm in position.

1005
01:21:22,571 --> 01:21:23,780
Handsome Rob?

1006
01:21:24,532 --> 01:21:27,408
We're in position.
Everything's quiet here, Charlie.

1007
01:21:30,246 --> 01:21:31,454
Wrench?

1008
01:21:32,456 --> 01:21:33,539
Set.

1009
01:21:49,974 --> 01:21:51,974
Charlie, we got an uninvited visitor.

1010
01:21:52,059 --> 01:21:54,477
There's a motorcycle guard
following the truck.

1011
01:21:54,562 --> 01:21:56,313
We'll deal with it.

1012
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,112
Who are these cats?

1013
01:22:04,155 --> 01:22:07,031
-What's wrong?
-Charlie, you won't believe this.

1014
01:22:07,116 --> 01:22:09,117
He's brought in three armored trucks.

1015
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:12,662
lt's a shell game. Shell game now.

1016
01:22:12,705 --> 01:22:15,874
Well, boss, l can't reroute the truck
if l don't know which truck to reroute.

1017
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:18,418
Just go with the one
that Steve follows in the helicopter.

1018
01:22:18,502 --> 01:22:21,212
Remember, you said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

1019
01:22:21,296 --> 01:22:23,672
Unless he's playing us, and he is.

1020
01:22:35,019 --> 01:22:36,561
Okay, let's go!

1021
01:22:36,896 --> 01:22:38,271
Moving out!

1022
01:22:51,744 --> 01:22:53,119
Here we go.

1023
01:22:53,663 --> 01:22:55,080
They're pulling out.

1024
01:22:55,831 --> 01:22:59,209
Napster, pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

1025
01:22:59,418 --> 01:23:01,711
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

1026
01:23:06,133 --> 01:23:08,259
Vine and Yucca.
They're all gonna cross there.

1027
01:23:08,803 --> 01:23:10,303
See which one's riding low.

1028
01:23:21,107 --> 01:23:23,566
First one is...clear.

1029
01:23:25,069 --> 01:23:27,028
The first two are the same, so....

1030
01:23:30,992 --> 01:23:33,910
Houston, we have our truck.
lt is number 1 28.

1031
01:23:43,295 --> 01:23:44,921
We're moving out.

1032
01:23:46,258 --> 01:23:49,592
Three-kilo-bob to two-fox-mike,
we're heading to the airport.

1033
01:24:03,817 --> 01:24:07,778
Okay, guys, truck 128
has turned right heading west.

1034
01:24:08,738 --> 01:24:09,904
Gridlock time.

1035
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:15,368
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone, please.

1036
01:24:19,874 --> 01:24:21,375
We've crashed.

1037
01:24:22,543 --> 01:24:24,627
lt's not a crash.

1038
01:24:25,839 --> 01:24:27,338
We've got power.

1039
01:24:28,799 --> 01:24:30,341
l can't log in.

1040
01:24:30,468 --> 01:24:33,971
They are about to hit a major detour
and be sent your way.

1041
01:24:41,645 --> 01:24:42,730
Oops.

1042
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:49,987
You'll never shut down...

1043
01:24:50,489 --> 01:24:53,323
the real Napster.

1044
01:25:00,664 --> 01:25:02,374
What's your problem?
The lights are all out!

1045
01:25:02,459 --> 01:25:04,126
What do you want me to do?

1046
01:25:08,298 --> 01:25:10,674
Truck 128, what is your progress?

1047
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,176
This is truck 128.

1048
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:15,262
Traffic's out of control here.
We've got to look for another route.

1049
01:25:16,848 --> 01:25:18,682
Check the police band.

1050
01:25:19,309 --> 01:25:21,852
Okay, l'm opening up a space
on Highland.

1051
01:25:26,023 --> 01:25:28,192
-Oh, get us out of here.
-l'm trying.

1052
01:25:34,032 --> 01:25:35,199
And he's taking it.

1053
01:25:40,747 --> 01:25:42,705
Police scanners are saying
computers are down...

1054
01:25:42,749 --> 01:25:44,667
at Traffic Control Center.

1055
01:25:45,252 --> 01:25:46,794
Nice, Charlie.

1056
01:25:47,879 --> 01:25:50,381
What are you up to? Go back.

1057
01:25:59,599 --> 01:26:01,892
l now command you to turn left.

1058
01:26:03,728 --> 01:26:05,645
Come on, take the left.

1059
01:26:07,607 --> 01:26:09,733
Yeah, you did. You did.

1060
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,562
Give us the flag.

1061
01:26:47,272 --> 01:26:50,566
Metro just passed through the station.
You are clear for 90 seconds.

1062
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:51,776
Go.

1063
01:27:07,876 --> 01:27:09,418
Come on, Steve.

1064
01:27:25,644 --> 01:27:26,852
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1065
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:32,984
-Whoa!
-Look out!

1066
01:27:33,485 --> 01:27:34,777
30 seconds and counting.

1067
01:27:41,702 --> 01:27:44,578
1 5 seconds, you're either blocked in
or you're paint on the train.

1068
01:27:50,168 --> 01:27:52,336
Go, go, come on, come on, come on!

1069
01:27:52,712 --> 01:27:54,589
Stay right on me. This is gonna be tight.

1070
01:28:01,555 --> 01:28:02,805
Go, go, go!

1071
01:28:02,847 --> 01:28:04,641
You're gonna stop right there.

1072
01:28:43,471 --> 01:28:44,597
Okay, guys.

1073
01:28:44,682 --> 01:28:46,182
Coming into position.

1074
01:28:46,225 --> 01:28:47,559
Stay cool.

1075
01:28:59,905 --> 01:29:01,072
Ten...

1076
01:29:01,866 --> 01:29:03,074
nine...

1077
01:29:03,492 --> 01:29:04,742
eight...

1078
01:29:05,244 --> 01:29:06,410
seven...

1079
01:29:06,704 --> 01:29:07,870
six...

1080
01:29:08,414 --> 01:29:09,580
five...

1081
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:11,081
four...

1082
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:12,750
Don't lose them, don't lose them,
don't lose them.

1083
01:29:12,792 --> 01:29:14,169
...three...

1084
01:29:14,252 --> 01:29:15,420
two...

1085
01:29:16,339 --> 01:29:17,380
one.

1086
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,445
Damn.

1087
01:29:47,411 --> 01:29:48,661
Where's my truck?

1088
01:29:48,746 --> 01:29:51,247
What? What the fuck
happened to my truck?

1089
01:29:55,127 --> 01:29:57,462
ltjust blew right through the street.

1090
01:29:57,838 --> 01:29:59,297
Well, get under there.

1091
01:30:10,976 --> 01:30:13,603
-We have another problem, guys.
-What?

1092
01:30:14,814 --> 01:30:17,482
-This isn't the Worthington 1 000.
-What?

1093
01:30:18,526 --> 01:30:20,485
He switched safes on us.

1094
01:30:21,987 --> 01:30:24,198
-Can you do it?
-lt's lsraeli made.

1095
01:30:24,281 --> 01:30:25,990
lt's got a glass re-lock system.

1096
01:30:26,033 --> 01:30:28,160
There's a pane of glass right here,
behind this door...

1097
01:30:28,244 --> 01:30:30,495
and if l don't drill perfectly
through that hole...

1098
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,998
steel rods snap into place
and you can't open the safe...

1099
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,749
and then we're up shit creek.

1100
01:31:05,656 --> 01:31:07,992
l think l just cracked the glass.

1101
01:31:09,118 --> 01:31:11,411
l don't think it broke, though.

1102
01:31:11,997 --> 01:31:13,872
l can't drill it again.

1103
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:16,332
l have to do it by touch.

1104
01:31:18,461 --> 01:31:21,338
l can't get through.
The train's blocking the tunnel.

1105
01:31:21,506 --> 01:31:23,506
Quick. Where does the Metro Rail

1117

Come on, come on, come on.

1124
01:33:45,191 --> 01:33:47,944
Hey, don't you want to see
what's inside?

1125
01:33:49,571 --> 01:33:50,946
Absolutely.

1126
01:33:54,743 --> 01:33:56,118
-Napster.
-Yeah.

1127
01:33:56,202 --> 01:33:58,537
Thirteen across, four high, four deep.

1128
01:34:00,206 --> 01:34:02,875
That's 208 bricks.

1129
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,126
How much?

1130
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:06,045
Oh. 208 times....

1131
01:34:10,134 --> 01:34:11,634
2.7. $2.7 million.

1132
01:34:11,719 --> 01:34:12,801
What?

1133
01:34:13,053 --> 01:34:15,764
No, it's 27. That's $27 million.

1134
01:34:15,847 --> 01:34:18,141
That's $27 million worth of gold.

1135
01:34:22,395 --> 01:34:23,937
Yeah!

1136
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:28,692
Got the Holy Spirit.

1137
01:34:29,069 --> 01:34:31,403
You should get on it. lt's a good train.

1138
01:35:09,234 --> 01:35:10,652
What'd you think, John?

1139
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:21,161
$27 million.

1140
01:35:21,246 --> 01:35:22,288
Say it again.

1141
01:35:22,331 --> 01:35:24,082
-$27 million.
-Say it again.

1142
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:25,834
-Say it again!
-$27 million.

1143
01:35:25,917 --> 01:35:27,377
Say it again!

1144
01:35:51,152 --> 01:35:53,403
Got two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

1145
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:58,992
l've got three Minis in a storm drain
heading east towards the LA River.

1146
01:35:59,076 --> 01:36:00,660
Stop them before they get to the street.

1147
01:36:06,167 --> 01:36:07,291
Shit!

1148
01:36:10,713 --> 01:36:11,838
Whoa!

1149
01:36:25,853 --> 01:36:27,270
Here we go.

1150
01:36:41,702 --> 01:36:43,203
Open your door.

1151
01:36:48,667 --> 01:36:50,585
Come on, guys, we're moving.

1152
01:36:55,174 --> 01:36:56,674
There, there, there.

1153
01:37:06,227 --> 01:37:08,561
Hey, come on, come on. Look out.

1154
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:37,842
Come on!

1155
01:37:44,723 --> 01:37:46,975
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1156
01:38:05,953 --> 01:38:08,329
l'm going to take Steve.
You guys go straight to Union Station.

1157
01:38:08,414 --> 01:38:09,789
l'll meet you there.

1158
01:38:10,833 --> 01:38:12,458
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1159
01:38:21,093 --> 01:38:23,511
Okay, Charlie,
l'm opening up a spot on Lower Grand.

1160
01:38:26,557 --> 01:38:28,433
l know it's you, Charlie.

1161
01:38:30,019 --> 01:38:31,186
Take your next left.

1162
01:39:30,955 --> 01:39:32,289
Nice move, Steve.

1163
01:40:11,371 --> 01:40:12,413
Get out!

1164
01:40:12,455 --> 01:40:13,664
-Get out!
-Okay.

1165
01:40:13,748 --> 01:40:15,416
l said get out!

1166
01:41:50,179 --> 01:41:52,263
They got a bunch of cars in there, right?

1167
01:41:52,348 --> 01:41:53,597
Mini Coopers?

1168
01:41:53,681 --> 01:41:55,349
Look, look, man, l don't know anything--

1169
01:41:55,391 --> 01:41:57,143
Hey, hey, hey, don't worry about them.

1170
01:41:57,186 --> 01:41:59,646
l'll give you $5000
if you put me inside that car.

1171
01:42:04,526 --> 01:42:06,569
Buy your girlfriend something nice.

1172
01:42:12,033 --> 01:42:13,243
Come on.

1173
01:42:18,666 --> 01:42:21,291
Half now,
half when you help me unload.

1174
01:42:26,214 --> 01:42:28,423
l got to hand it to you, Steve...

1175
01:42:28,508 --> 01:42:31,261
you actually played this one
pretty smart.

1176
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:33,930
Decoy trucks, you switched safes.

1177
01:42:34,013 --> 01:42:37,432
The helicopter routine,
l mean, that was pretty damn good.

1178
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:40,394
But now l've got the gold
and you, you've got nothing.

1179
01:42:40,436 --> 01:42:41,563
l got this.

1180
01:42:41,647 --> 01:42:44,565
So cut the crap,
and give me my goddamn gold!

1181
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:00,623
Who the hell are you?

1182
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,250
l am Mashkov...

1183
01:43:02,667 --> 01:43:04,419
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

1184
01:43:04,461 --> 01:43:07,088
You gotta have some insurance, Steve.

1185
01:43:16,098 --> 01:43:18,266
Yevhen was already dead
when l got there.

1186
01:43:18,309 --> 01:43:20,184
l'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with...

1187
01:43:20,269 --> 01:43:22,979
a lot of unsavory people.
Now, this guy's trying to play you.

1188
01:43:23,063 --> 01:43:24,647
You were right...

1189
01:43:25,482 --> 01:43:27,025
no imagination.

1190
01:43:29,612 --> 01:43:31,487
There's a lot of gold in there.

1191
01:43:31,572 --> 01:43:34,574
We're the only ones with guns.
l'll make you a good deal.

1192
01:43:41,916 --> 01:43:43,958
l've already made my deal.

1193
01:43:49,548 --> 01:43:51,132
What do you want?

1194
01:43:51,175 --> 01:43:53,468
You know this was never about the gold.

1195
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:55,511
Whatever helps you sleep at night,
sweetheart.

1196
01:44:00,351 --> 01:44:02,936
Bitch! Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

1197
01:44:04,855 --> 01:44:06,689
-Okay.
-Beautiful.

1198
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:08,942
That l love.

1199
01:44:08,984 --> 01:44:11,277
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1200
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,405
l'll double whatever he's given you.
Just don't shoot me.

1201
01:44:13,489 --> 01:44:16,074
Don't worry, l'm not going to shoot you.

1202
01:44:16,283 --> 01:44:18,493
No, l'm going to take you
to my workplace.

1203
01:44:18,995 --> 01:44:21,996
l think you'll be very interested
in some of the machinery l use.

1204
01:44:24,583 --> 01:44:25,917
No, come on.

1205
01:44:31,757 --> 01:44:33,841
Guys, l wanna make a toast.

1206
01:44:35,094 --> 01:44:36,761
To John Bridger...

1207
01:44:37,012 --> 01:44:39,598
the most brilliant master planner of all.

1208
01:44:39,683 --> 01:44:41,891
-Father and friend.
-To my dad.

1209
01:44:41,977 --> 01:44:43,309
-To John.
-To John.

1210
01:44:47,356 --> 01:44:50,191
Stella was right.
lt wasn't about the money.

1211
01:44:50,234 --> 01:44:53,319
Of course, that didn't stop the guys
from having a little bit of fun.

1212
01:44:54,905 --> 01:44:57,365
Handsome Rob got his Aston Martin.

1213
01:45:01,871 --> 01:45:04,290
He took it for a ride to break it in.

1214
01:45:18,053 --> 01:45:20,014
He got off with a warning.

1215
01:45:23,058 --> 01:45:26,312
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain...

1216
01:45:26,396 --> 01:45:28,689
with a room just for his shoes.

1217
01:45:37,449 --> 01:45:40,450
Lyle finally made the cover
ofWired magazine.

1218
01:45:43,579 --> 01:45:45,706
Are you really the Napster?

1219
01:45:47,416 --> 01:45:48,584
Yes, l am.

1220
01:45:48,626 --> 01:45:51,419
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

1221
01:45:52,921 --> 01:45:54,672
Would you listen to something for me?

1222
01:45:54,757 --> 01:45:58,302
With speakers so loud,
it could blow a woman's clothes off.

1223
01:46:01,972 --> 01:46:03,431
lf you would.

1224
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:19,948
And me?

1225
01:46:20,533 --> 01:46:22,743
l took John Bridger's advice.

1226
01:46:23,536 --> 01:46:26,747
l found somebody
l wanna spend the rest of my life with...

1227
01:46:26,790 --> 01:46:29,416
and l'm gonna hold on to her forever.

1228
01:46:30,305 --> 01:47:30,889
