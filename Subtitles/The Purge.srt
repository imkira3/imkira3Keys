00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,966
<i>Mr. Faulk? James Sandin.</i>

3
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,007
<i>Hey, Mr. Sandin.</i>

4
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,526
I talked to John over at
repairs, and he took care of it.

5
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,726
It's all fine.

6
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,165
The system is working
without a hitch.

7
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,765
You are going to be
locked in tight tonight.

8
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,921
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,082
All right, Mr. Faulk.
Safe night.

10
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,126
<i>James Sandin's office.</i>

11
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,690
Sue? Yeah,
I took care of Faulk.

12
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,841
What do you know,
did you hear anything?

13
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,081
<i>You're number one,
Mr. Sandin.</i>

14
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,963
All right. Yeah.
<i>You got it, sir. You came out on top.</i>

15
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

16
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,525
Congratulations
to you, too, Susan.

17
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,567
<i>You don't have to say that.</i>

18
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,361
No, Susan, it's a team win.
<i>Thank you.</i>

19
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,204
Okay. All right,
well, safe night.

20
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,282
<i>Safe night, Mr. Sandin.</i>

21
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,047
<i>The poor can't
afford to protect themselves.</i>

22
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,406
<i>They're the victims tonight.</i>

23
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,720
<i>We all got our own opinions.</i>

24
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,040
<i>That's what makes
this country great.</i>

25
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,441
<i>Holly, line four.
What are your Purge plans?</i>

26
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,881
<i>Locking down behind my
brand new security system.</i>

27
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,361
<i>Pete from Northern Virginia,
what's your Purge plan?</i>

28
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,050
<i>I'm gonna hunt down my boss.</i>

29
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,485
<i>That son of a bitch
has it coming.</i>

30
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,080
<i>Clearly, more people will be Purging
this year than ever before.</i>

31
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,929
<i>American streets will
be running red tonight,</i>

32
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,481
<i>when people release the beast
in record numbers.</i>

33
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,444
Mr. Cali! You're getting one
last walk in before lockdown, huh?

34
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,521
Yep.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,280
Did you do the systems
check I recommended?

36
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,560
Of course.
No problems.

37
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,847
Yeah, it's the same one I use.
I only sell the best.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,530
Nobody's bothering us tonight.

39
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,768
You have a safe night, Mr. Sandin.
Thanks.

40
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,769
<i>Don't forget
to buy your blue Baptisias.</i>

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,401
<i>Display those flowers
proudly, folks, okay?</i>

42
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,847
<i>Show your support
for this important evening.</i>

43
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,921
<i>Safe night to everyone.</i>

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,128
Home again, home again.
Jiggity-jig.

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,647
<i>Release the beast,
and Purge in our American streets.</i>

46
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,521
<i>Your New Founding Fathers...</i>

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,610
Hey, honey, I'm home!

48
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,125
I'm in the kitchen.

49
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,565
What a day, what a day.

50
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,530
Everybody's doing security
checks, it's crazy.

51
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,206
Traffic's even worse
than last year.

52
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,283
Something smells good.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,206
Hey.

54
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,565
Ta-da!
Ah.

55
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,364
I'll put them in water,
get them outside.

56
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,403
Okay.
Where are the kids?

57
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,130
Their rooms, of course.

58
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,160
We got an hour
before commencement, right?

59
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,565
Mmm-hmm.
Dinner's nearly ready,

60
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,290
so, uh, hurry up.
All right.

61
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,970
Well, I have to make a few phone calls.
Mmm-hmm.

62
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,041
Oh.

63
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,406
One thing?
Yeah?

64
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,766
Zoey is getting worse.

65
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,366
She's been pouting all day.
I can't stand it.

66
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,801
So, you're gonna have to do something
about the Henry situation.

67
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,166
There's nothing to do about it.

68
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,480
He's 18, he's not
getting any younger.

69
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,006
She's just gonna have to sulk.
She'll get over it.

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,720
But I've got some good
news for all of us.

71
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,364
I'll tell you at dinner.

72
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,367
<i>History has
proven this over and over again.</i>

73
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,681
<i>We are inherently
a violent species.</i>

74
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,922
<i>Wars, genocide, murder.</i>

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,651
<i>The denial of our true
selves is the problem.</i>

76
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,645
<i>The Purge not only contains societal
violence to a single evening,</i>

77
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,929
<i>but the country-wide catharsis
creates psychological stability</i>

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,561
<i>by letting us release the aggression
we all have inside of us.</i>

79
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,610
I love you.

80
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,446
Let's growl.

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,847
What?

82
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,206
Growl.
Why?

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,608
Because everyone says,
"I love you."

84
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,251
It's used, and we need
to find our own thing.

85
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,930
Oh.
Go like this...

86
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,486
No, I'll look silly.

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,766
Come on.
No.

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,127
Do it. It's our way of saying,
"I love you." Try it.

89
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,201
Do it.

90
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,801
I think my dad's home.

91
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,325
I'm sorry, baby. You've
got to get going.

92
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,481
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,610
And you have to get
home before lockdown.

94
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,171
Come on.

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,366
Come here.

96
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,087
Someone's getting
ready for tonight.

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,644
Be careful.

98
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,801
Mary!

99
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,290
I'm so glad I caught you.

100
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,930
I come bearing gifts.

101
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,445
What have I done
to deserve a gift, Grace?

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,971
Oh, I have a new hobby.
Baking. Grace. Mary.

103
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,246
I made way too many cookies.

104
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,810
Hi!
Ooh! Cookies!

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,286
I hope you're hungry.

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,731
Those cookies are crazy good.

107
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,125
They're lovely.

108
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,045
Have a safe night, ladies.

109
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,531
Bye!
Good night!

110
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,008
Bye!
Thank you, Grace.

111
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,562
Yeah, just what the Halversons needed.
More cookies, right?

112
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,561
Oh!

113
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,647
The new addition you built,
it's just amazing.

114
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,721
Thank you.

115
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,451
Not everyone had the
year you did, Mary.

116
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,921
What do you mean?

117
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,609
You know your husband
sold a new security system

118
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,609
to almost every home
in this community.

119
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,807
You know, some people
are actually saying

120
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,441
this neighborhood paid for that
new addition on your home.

121
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,683
Are people really saying that?

122
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,922
Relax, it's just good old
neighborhood gossip.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,082
Nothing to worry about.

124
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,605
You're too sensitive.

125
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,489
So, are you having your
annual party, Grace?

126
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,369
No. Too much trouble.

127
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,522
We're just gonna lock down,
watch some Purge events.

128
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,125
Nothing special.

129
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,846
Well, um,
thank you for the cookies.

130
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,961
Good night.

131
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,168
You're welcome.

132
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,325
Have a safe night, Mary.

133
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,970
And you, Grace.

134
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,400
<i>Christ.</i>

135
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,164
<i>You scared me to death.</i>

136
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,000
<i>You can't keep creeping up
on me like that, Charlie.</i>

137
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,490
<i>So, quit playing with Timmy and come
help me set the table, kiddo. Okay?</i>

138
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,161
<i>Now.</i>

139
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,728
Christ! Charlie,
that's twice today.

140
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,370
You're gonna give me
a heart attack.

141
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,561
Sorry, Mom.

142
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,007
Look, check it out. I made
some adjustments to Timmy.

143
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,764
I installed
a night vision program

144
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,127
and I insulated his motor,
so you can barely hear him.

145
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,330
And he can now play music to
accompany him on his missions.

146
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,241
See?

147
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,607
He likes songs from olden times.
Mmm-hmm.

148
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,441
That is very, very cool.

149
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,209
What is it?
What's bothering you?

150
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,926
It's tonight, isn't it?

151
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,246
Just remember all the good
the Purge does, okay?

152
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,367
It's all that matters.

153
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,165
Are you hungry?

154
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,727
A little bit.

155
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,847
Good.

156
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,129
Well, take Timmy away and come
back and help me finish up, okay?

157
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,440
Mmm. Okay.

158
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,722
Honey, this food is so good.

159
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,928
Isn't it amazing?
Not one carb.

160
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,924
Oh, great.
Not one.

161
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,846
Well, I'd like to hear
about everybody's day.

162
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,001
Zoey, you want to go first?

163
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,566
Charlie, what are you doing?

164
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,403
Sorry, I forgot
to take my vitals earlier.

165
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,601
Honey...

166
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,964
By the way, there's a slight
deviation in my heart rate,

167
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,610
but other than that,

168
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,640
nothing to worry about.

169
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,921
Okay, thank you.

170
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,525
Zoey, your day.

171
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,131
I don't want to do
this anymore.

172
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,925
It's stupid.

173
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,925
Okay, fine.

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,765
Calc test, piano. Normal day.
Mmm-hmm.

175
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,241
Who cares?

176
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,163
I do.
I care, very much.

177
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,280
And what about practice?
You ready for your recital?

178
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,321
James.

179
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,765
Of course you are,
because you're always ready.

180
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,360
Just make sure your left hand
cooperates in that third movement.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,002
When I'm listening,
that's what I hear.

182
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,770
All right, can I...

183
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,080
Does anybody mind?
Can I do my day?

184
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,242
- I have some news. Um...
- Go ahead.

185
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,365
I did it. I did it.

186
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,203
All sales are final...

187
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,647
And I'm on top.

188
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,450
My division sold the most
upgraded security systems.

189
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,965
Congratulations, Dad.
Thank you.

190
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,166
Congratulations, baby.

191
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,685
Thanks. It's a team
effort, you know?

192
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,648
All right, Charlie,
you're next.

193
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,411
Well, we studied the history
of tonight in History.

194
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,569
And in English, I wrote a story

195
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,446
about a man whose love is so
powerful, that it can kill people.

196
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,130
So, he cuts out his own heart.

197
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,010
That is so sweet.

198
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,082
You know, he should have
cut off his own penis.

199
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,491
Zoey, Zoey...

200
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,244
Eating dinner, no penises!

201
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,880
Charlie, don't encourage her.

202
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,121
Don't fist-bump that!

203
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,887
We're not
in the dormitorium, okay?

204
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,123
"Dormitorium?"
Is that even a word?

205
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,929
Get with the times.
God.

206
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,610
Guys, look what time it is.

207
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,330
Oh, wow,
it's later than I thought.

208
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,085
All right, it's time
for lockdown. Let's go.

209
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,084
Don't even think about it.

210
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,446
Hey, give that back.
Are we in the zoo?

211
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,521
Fine, I want this.

212
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,960
Hey, look at this.

213
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,007
Mr. Sabian and Mr. Barbero
are going hunting.

214
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,491
That's daring.

215
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,160
I didn't know they were
going to Purge together.

216
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,241
Are they friends?

217
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,162
Hmm. The Ferrins
are having a party.

218
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,009
Grace said she wasn't
having a party this year.

219
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,730
Just thank God
we weren't invited.

220
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,371
She's nice. But, wow,
she's annoying.

221
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,284
All right, let's get
ready for tonight.

222
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,003
As always, just a precaution.

223
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,683
All right, Mr. Cali is
starting his lockdown.

224
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,801
Okay.

225
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,524
Are we ready?

226
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,370
All right, let's hit it.

227
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,089
Okay, Charlie, it's
almost time. Hit it.

228
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,763
<i>Release the beast
and Purge in our American streets.</i>

229
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,367
<i>Your New Founding Fathers

230
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,924

231

234
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,088

235

236
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,842

246

<i>May God be with you all.</i>

248
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,088
Okay, kids. I know bad
things do happen tonight.

249
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,970
But we can afford protection.

250
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,361
So, we'll be fine, just like always.
No worries.

251
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,091
Okay? Okay?

252
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,806
Can I go now?

253
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,960
I would prefer to be
miserable in my room.

254
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,607
Of course you may.
Thank you for being here.

255
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,642
Where are you going, bud?

256
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,449
Hey. Charlie.

257
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,048
Why don't you guys do it?

258
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,127
Because we don't feel the
need to, Charlie. That's all.

259
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,166
So, if you felt the need to,

260
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,651
you would kill someone tonight?

261
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,930
Look, I know this is difficult
to understand at your age,

262
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,402
but tonight allows
people a release

263
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,723
for all the hatred and
violence and aggression

264
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,643
that they keep up inside them.

265
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,203
Okay? And yes,

266
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,444
if your mother and I were so
inclined, uh, we would participate.

267
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,249
Because it works.

268
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,561
You don't remember
how bad it was, Charlie.

269
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,563
The poverty, all the crime.

270
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,202
This night saved our country.

271
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,165
Hey...

272
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,731
Why don't you go relax?
We're all done here.

273
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,203
I've got some paperwork
to process to get my bonus.

274
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,850
Then we should watch a
movie later with the kids.

275
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,046
Jesus, Henry!

276
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,448
You scared the hell out of me.

277
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,410
Wait, what are you doing here?

278
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,404
I wanted to surprise you.

279
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,960
So, I snuck in
when you were eating.

280
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,809
Baby, you can't be in here.

281
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,168
My dad will lose his mind
if he sees you here now.

282
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,480
Come on.

283
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,083
Aren't you happy to see me?

284
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,931
Of course.

285
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,361
<i>We're looking at some
live feeds from around the country</i>

286
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,922
<i>and discussing the Purge with
criminologist Tommy Aagaard.</i>

287
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,001
<i>Thanks, Nicole.</i>

288
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,924
<i>Now, is the Purge really
about releasing aggression</i>

289
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,286
<i>and containing violence,</i>

290
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,004
<i>or is it something else?</i>

291

292

<i>this evening is actually about

293
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,370
<i>the needy, the sick.</i>

294
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,249
<i>Those unable

295

<i>"non-contributing members"

<i>ultimately unburdening

298

really about money?</i>

299
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,124
<i>Either way, crime is down.
The economy is flourishing.</i>

300
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,764
I can't do this.

301
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,287
Um...

302
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,482
Did I do something?
No. I... Um...

303
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,089
I just...

304
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,531
I didn't come here to see you.

305
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,531
I came to see your father.

306
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,761
What? Why?

307
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,366
It's time
to straighten this out.

308
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,047
He cannot forbid you
from seeing me.

309
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,326
That's crazy.

310
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,971
It might be crazy, but he's
not going to change his mind.

311
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,371
He thinks
you're too old for me.

312
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,442
Talking to him is only going
to make him more angry

313
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,126
and he'll make it
more difficult for us.

314
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,164
I promise everything
is gonna be okay.

315
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,450
<i>America was collapsing.</i>

316

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,604
<i>All precipitating
the worst economic disaster</i>

320
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,728
<i>in the history
of the United States.</i>

321
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,326
<i>Crime and poverty
rose exponentially,</i>

322
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,643
<i>and the New Founding Fathers,
just months after being elected</i>

323
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,001
<i>came up with
this audacious notion,</i>

324
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,448
<i>the decriminalization
of murder for one night.</i>

325
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,490
<i>A lawful outlet
for American rage.</i>

326
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,682
<i>A way to contain crime.</i>

327
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,082
<i>The undeniable fact is,
this is working.</i>

328
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,924
I thought I heard gunshots.

329
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,290
A couple of streets back,
maybe?

330
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,001
Gunshots are gonna happen tonight, okay?
It's nothing.

331
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,287
It's probably somebody just
firing off a few rounds

332
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,203
before going hunting.

333
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,841
Come on.
Let's go relax.

334
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,965
Hold on.

335
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,568
Look.
He can't kick me out.

336
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,962
He's gonna be forced to
listen to what I have to say.

337
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,371
I don't know.

338
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,442
One on one.
Man to man, no BS.

339
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,283
I'm gonna explain to him
that sure, I may be older,

340
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,931
but you're also very mature.

341
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,844
So age difference
is not a problem.

342
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,401
I'll tell him
how much I love you.

343
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,647
10 years ago,
we could barely afford rent.

344
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,326
Now we're thinking about buying a boat.

345
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,765
Crazy.

346
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,361
Yeah... Uh-oh.

347
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,363
This one has a car garage.

348
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,009
Who needs a car on a boat?

349
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,684
<i>They're coming after me.</i>

350
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,444
<i>They're gonna kill me!</i>

351
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,606
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

352
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,331
<i>Help me!
Someone, please, help me!</i>

353
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,450
<i>They're coming
after me, all right?</i>

354
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,127
<i>Can anybody help me?</i>

355
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,647
<i>Please. They killed...</i>

356
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,324
<i>I just need to get
somewhere safe.</i>

357
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,602
<i>Does anybody hear me?</i>

358
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,963
<i>Look, I won't hurt you!</i>

359
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,924
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

360
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,570
<i>I don't deserve this.</i>

361
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,644
<i>Why won't anybody help me?</i>

362
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,649
<i>I just need somewhere to hide.</i>

363
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,121
<i>Somebody, please, just
open the door for me.</i>

364
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,487
<i>They're coming, they're coming.
Somebody, please!</i>

365
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,041
<i>They're gonna kill me!</i>

366
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,844
What the hell?

367
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,241
Come here!

368
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,367
Let's go!
This way!

369
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,371
Come on!

370
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,521
Hurry!

371
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,607
Come on! Hurry!

372
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,920
What the hell?

373
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,807
Charlie! Zoey!

374
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,804
This way! Hurry!

375
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,006
Go! Go!

376
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,521
Hurry!

377
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,440
What the hell is going on?

378
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,406
Mr. Sandin.

379
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,881
James, he has a gun!
Henry has a gun!

380
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,600
Oh, my God!

381
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,531
Henry!

382
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,005
Henry! Henry!

383
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,684
Oh, God!

384
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,884
James. Are you hit?

385
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,171
I didn't hit Zoey, did I?

386
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,366
I think she's okay.

387
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,488
Zoey! Zoey!

388
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,800
Charlie, come here.

389
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,291
Mom, what's going on?

390
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,203
Charlie, where is he, huh?

391
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,005
Where's the man?

392
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,125
I don't know.
I don't understand.

393
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,601
Who is he? Why did you
let him in our home?

394
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,967
He was hurt. He called for help.
No one was helping him.

395
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,247
Charlie, Jesus Christ.
What the hell? Huh?

396
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,771
We have no idea what
this man is capable of.

397
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,729
Enough.
Enough, James.

398
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,042
He's gone. We don't know
what Henry might do.

399
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,044
And we're not safe out here.
We don't know where Zoey is.

400
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,367
You're right.
Let's go. Come on.

401
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,680
Come on, come on, come on.

402
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,364
Let's go. Let's go.

403
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,720
Henry! Henry.

404
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,811
Hang on.

405
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,281
Henry!

406
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,880
Come on.

407
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,771
Henry?

408
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,811
Okay.

409
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,330
Here's the plan.

410
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,724
You two stay put here,
and I'll just...

411
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,570
I'll go out there
and I'm gonna find Zoey

412
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,165
and I'm gonna
bring her back here.

413
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,364
Henry tried to kill you.
James...

414
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,761
I know. Mary, I got
to make sure she's okay.

415
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,205
Okay? I have to.

416
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,009
He didn't shoot at me.

417
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,086
I'll find her,

418
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,844
I can go. I'll be fine.
No, no, no...

419
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,010
I can't let you go
with that man out there.

420
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,240
Okay?
I can't let you do that.

421
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,925
Baby, I...

422
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,081
Let me go get her.

423
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,925
You just stay here
with Charlie. Okay?

424
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,240
You be careful, okay?

425
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,651
I will.

426
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,971
Zoey? Zoey?

427
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,530
Zoey? It's me.

428
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,841
You okay, sweetheart?

429
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,765
Yeah, Mom.

430
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,406
Okay.

431
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,045
Mom?

432
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,485
Mom?

433
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,728
Charlie? Mom?

434
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,522
Charlie, you wait here. I'm gonna
be right outside the door.

435
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,726
Okay.

436
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,320
Zoey.

437
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,526
Zoey?

438
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,530
Mom?

439
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,361
Zoey, sweetheart.

440
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,044
Are you okay?
Is Charlie okay?

441
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,083
Where's Dad? Is he all right?
Everyone's fine.

442
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,685
Morn, I didn't know Henry
was going to do that.

443
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,007
I didn't know he was going to...
Why would he do that?

444
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,287
Mom? Charlie, just give
me a second, okay?

445
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,361
Mom, he died.
Keep the door closed.

446
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,249
- He's dead. Henry's dead.
- Mom?

447
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,081
Mom!

448
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,764
Charlie, just give me a second.

449
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,080
Zoey, let's see
what Charlie wants.

450
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,207
Mom, now!

451
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,410
What is it, baby?

452
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,481
You need to see this.

453
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,961
Tell Dad I'm sorry.

454
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,769
Zoey, please!

455
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,486
Zoey!

456
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,045
Zoey?

457
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,445
Zoey.

458
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,327
Hey,
Mr. Sandin, are you home?

459
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,771
Wait, James,
I have to talk to you.

460
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,450
Henry is dead.

461
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,124
I killed him.

462
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,009
I know. I saw Zoey.

463
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,570
Is she okay? Is she hurt?
Is she in there?

464
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,681
She's not hurt.

465
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,728
I couldn't get her
to come with me.

466
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,602
What are we gonna do?

467
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,722
I have to show you something.

468
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,362
Oh, God, I know.

469
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,929
That one is saying something.

470
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,569
<i>...and Mrs. Sandin.</i>

471
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,210
<i>Your home tells me you're
good folk, just like us.</i>

472
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,611
<i>One of the "haves."</i>

473
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,526
<i>And your blue flowers tell me
that you support the Purge.</i>

474
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,649
<i>We want to treat you fairly,
so listen closely.</i>

475
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,721
<i>Let me introduce us.</i>

476
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:51,405
<i>We are some fine, young,
very educated guys and gals.</i>

477
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,450
<i>We have gotten gussied up
in our most terrifying guises,</i>

478
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,046
<i>as we do every year,</i>

479
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,728
<i>ready to violate, annihilate,
and cleanse our souls.</i>

480
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,242
<i>But things took a turn.</i>

481
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,642
<i>Our target escaped us, and...</i>

482
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,566
<i>Several of your dear neighbors
informed us that you, the Sandins,</i>

483
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,486
<i>have inexplicably
given him sanctuary.</i>

484
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,129
<i>Mr. and Mrs., the man
you're sheltering is nothing</i>

485
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,123
<i>but a dirty, homeless pig.</i>

486
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,681
<i>A grotesque menace
to our just society,</i>

487
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,127
<i>who had the audacity
to fight back,</i>

488
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,488
<i>killing one of us when we
attempted to execute him tonight.</i>

489
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,404
<i>The pig doesn't know his place,</i>

490
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,608
<i>and now he needs
to be taught a lesson.</i>

491
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,848
<i>You need to return him to us.</i>

492
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,051
<i>Alive.</i>

493
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,561
<i>So that we may Purge
as we are entitled.</i>

494
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,443
<i>Here's the plan, Sandins.</i>

495
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,646
<i>You have until our
provisions arrive,</i>

496
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,690
<i>provisions which will help us
break into your elegant home.</i>

497
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,165
<i>If you don't...</i>

498
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,963
<i>If you don't deliver him
by the aforementioned time,</i>

499
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,208
<i>we'll release
the beast on him...</i>

500
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,725
<i>And on you.</i>

501
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,442
<i>And, um, we can enter
any home we want.</i>

502
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,481
<i>And we will want as wanting is
our will on this fine night.</i>

503
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,882
<i>Don't force us to hurt you.</i>

504
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,369
<i>We don't want to kill our own.</i>

505
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,845
<i>Please, just let us Purge.</i>

506
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,522
<i>Toodle-oo, Sandins.</i>

507
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,320
<i>Cut it. Cut it now.</i>

508
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,561
The monitors are
working on backup.

509
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,731
The power's out
in the whole house.

510
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,411
James, they can't
get in here, right?

511
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,687
They can't get into our home.

512
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,886
I don't know.

513
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,451
It's hard to say.

514
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,249
You don't know?

515
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,569
You sell these
security systems.

516
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,005
What do you mean,
you don't know?

517
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,323
We have tested the system. It
works 99 percent of the time.

518
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,926
It looks good. It's strong.
People stay away.

519
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,800
It looks good?

520
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,281
It's not built
for worst-case scenarios.

521
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,728
Is it impenetrable?
No, nothing's impenetrable.

522
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,004
Things like this are not supposed
to happen in our neighborhood.

523
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,367
Well, they are
happening, James.

524
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,046
They're happening right now.
Do you see this?

525
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,921
Okay, listen, just sit down.
Sit down, please.

526
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,809
We gotta calm down.
Sit down.

527
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,601
All right. Sit down, sit down.
Listen.

528
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,442
Okay, to answer your question,
yes, they could get in here.

529
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,571
They could tunnel
underneath us.

530
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,051
They could smoke us out.

531
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,124
They could devise
a battering ram, okay?

532
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,687
I'm sorry, but it's true. So,
here's what we're gonna do.

533
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,810
We're gonna give
them what they want.

534
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,846
We're gonna find that man and
we're gonna force him outside.

535
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,328
Now, we have guns,
and he doesn't.

536
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,324
But they'll kill him.

537
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,006
Why should he die?

538
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,844
It's him or us, Charlie.

539
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,766
Why don't you
give us the homeless man?

540
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,366
No one will
miss him when he's gone.

541
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,091
Pretty please.

542
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,484
Wait a minute.

543
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,484
Shit.

544
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,651
Where is he?

545
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,761
There he is.

546
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,331
Look at me.

547
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,922
Come on, look over here.

548
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,800
Where are you?

549
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,166
Come on.

550
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,201
Dear Mr. Sandin!

551
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,929
Sorry to interrupt, but
I'd love to have a word.

552
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,648
Meet me by your front door. I
just need a moment, good sir.

553
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,489
There you are.

554
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,201
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

555
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,408
Tell me, why haven't you delivered
the filthy swine to me yet?

556
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,848
Are you protecting him?

557
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,601
I surely hope not,
Mr. Sandin.

558
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,569
No. Of course not.

559
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,926
We just can't find him.

560
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,721
You see,
this is a misunderstanding.

561
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,325
My son let him in.

562
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,243
He's a young boy.
He doesn't know better.

563
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,403
But I support what occurs here
tonight 100 percent, okay?

564
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,369
I sell security equipment.

565
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,249
So, I would never deny yours,

566
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,084
or anybody else's
right to Purge.

567
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,006
Just give us the
homeless pig, you fuck!

568
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,769
Sorry about that.

569
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,923
I don't condone
that kind of behavior.

570
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,686
But just keep in mind,
Mr. Sandin...

571
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,843
He was my friend,

572
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,685
and you are not.

573
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,967
Our equipment is arriving soon.

574
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,363
And we will get in.

575
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,888
Send out he, or that...

576
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,483
Will be thee.

577
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,881
I'll go get him.

578
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,485
You should do that.

579
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,966
<i>Hey, Charlie.</i>

580
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,846
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

581
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,207
<i>There are people outside.</i>

582
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,361
<i>Um...</i>

583
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,528
<i>And Henry's dead.</i>

584
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,809
<i>I'll be okay.
I have his gun.</i>

585
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,123
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

586
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,168
<i>Please be safe, okay?</i>

587
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,967
<i>I'm going to go hide
in your secret spot.</i>

588
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,440
No.

589
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,444
<i>All right? I love you.</i>

590
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,841
Don't.

591
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,481
Zoey.

592
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,165
Get back.

593
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,363
Into the hall.
Let's go.

594
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,324
Drop your gun.

595
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,405
Dad, please.

596
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,850
Drop it.

597
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,401
<i>Don't hurt her.</i>

598
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,687
<i>Lower your weapon.</i>

599
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,441
Zoey, I will not
let him hurt you.

600
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,603
Leave her alone,
you son of a bitch.

601
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,803
I will let her go
when this night is over.

602
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,291
You're gonna get us
all killed. You know that.

603
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,521
They're coming in here, and
they are gonna kill us all.

604
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,920
They are gonna come in here,
and they are... Back up.

605
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,761
You got to leave my
family out of this. Okay?

606
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,001
If you don't drop your gun,

607
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,929
I will hurt her
and I will hurt you.

608
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,644
We didn't do anything to you.

609
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,003
We don't deserve this. I
don't deserve this either.

610
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,889
Now, listen, I don't
want to hurt any of you,

611
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,331
but I am not dying tonight!

612
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,881
Drop your gun.

613
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,291
Please.
Drop it.

614
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,011
Put the gun down.

615
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,208
Listen to me.
Okay.

616
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,364
You are going to die tonight.

617
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,001
And you can either
die like a man,

618
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,128
and walk outside
there by yourself,

619
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,964
or you can die like a coward

620
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,203
and get my wife and my children
killed along with you.

621
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,568
Okay? So take that gun away
from my daughter's head!

622
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,320
Shoot him, Mary! Shoot him!

623
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,209
Get off me!

624
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,211
Stop!

625
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,124
Shit. Shit.

626
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,485
Mary? Mary!

627
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,601
Zoey!

628
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,286
She's unconscious. She hit her head.

629
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,405
Mary, are you okay?

630
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,922
We got to get some rope.
What?

631
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,970
Mary, we have to get some rope

632
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,203
and we have to tie him up
and get him outside.

633
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,084
And we're gonna end
this goddamn night.

634
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,884
All right?
Do you hear me?

635
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,445
Okay. Okay.

636
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,522
All right. Come on,
Charlie, help me.

637
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,965
Sweetheart?

638
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,405
Sweetheart?

639
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,606
Okay, I'm almost done here. As
soon as you get the legs secure...

640
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,201
You got it? All right, let me see.
Let me see. Good job.

641
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,044
You're doing great, honey.

642
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,691
Here's what we're gonna do. We're
gonna roll him into that chair,

643
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,046
and we're gonna
drag him outside

644
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,246
and we're gonna
be done, all right?

645
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,123
Mmm-hmm. You got it?
All right, we ready?

646
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,851
Charlie, just concentrate
on your sister, okay?

647
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,490
See if she's waking up.

648
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,250
Except, Charlie,
I need the light.

649
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,209
Thank you, son. Okay.

650
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,721
Hey, good job.
You're doing great.

651
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,404
All right. Let me get
the chair, here.

652
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,482
Okay, we are almost done.

653
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,689
I'm gonna pick him up on the
count of three, all right?

654
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,727
You're gonna help me.

655
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,088
Keep the light on us, Charlie.
Ready? One, two...

656
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,241
Three!

657
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,765
Okay.

658
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,083
Great. Now, let's get the
tape and tape him in there.

659
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,760
Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

660
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,922
I've got him, I've got him.
I got him.

661
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,288
Okay. Okay, all right!

662
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,288
You got to calm down. He's
gonna break this tape!

663
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,123
Press on his wound.
What?

664
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,567
Get the letter opener
and press on his wound!

665
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,125
Get the letter
opener on the desk!

666
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,604
Grab the letter opener!

667
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,886
No, Mom!

668
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,090
Listen to me. I am just
trying to protect my family.

669
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,451
Just calm down.

670
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,641
Mom!

671
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,961
Come on, do it.

672
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,326
Do it, Mary!
Do it!

673
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,686
Press on his wound!

674
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,280
Yes!

675
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,361
Mom!

676
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,721
You want her to do it again?

677
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,767
Mom, stop!

678
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,240
Just do it again, Mary.

679
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,164
Okay. All right.

680
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,001
Okay. Ready to sit
in the chair?

681
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,931
Yeah, he's ready.
Help me up. Help me up.

682
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,371
Ready? Okay.

683
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,768
Stay there, all right?
Stop it.

684
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,842
Just let me take you
in this chair. All right?

685
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,843
Mary, where's the tape?

686
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,482
You are making this much more
difficult than it needs to be.

687
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,483
You understand me? Huh?

688
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,685
Christ, look at us.
Look at this man.

689
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,000
Look at what
we're doing to him.

690
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,761
Come on, Mary.

691
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,569
Let's get this over with.

692
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,771
Come on, Mary.

693
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,526
It's okay, Mary.

694
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,245
I can't.
Oh, yes, you can.

695
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,322
I need you right now, okay?

696
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,121
Hey, look at me. Huh?
Look at me, Mary.

697
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,330
Mary.

698
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,971
It's wrong. It's so wrong.
We don't have a choice.

699
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,727
This is so wrong.

700
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,040
We don't have any other choice.

701
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,560
Don't touch me.
Look at you.

702
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,491
No, no, no.
Don't touch me.

703
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,805
When did this happen?

704
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,724
James, look at you.

705
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,563
What the hell
happened to us, James?

706
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,011
Charlie.

707
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,087
Charlie? Baby, where did you go?
Charlie?

708
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,171
Charlie!

709
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,043
Charlie, where are you, baby?

710
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,009
Charlie!

711
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,204
Zoey. Hey,
are you all right?

712
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,206
Sit down, sit down.

713
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,726
You hit your head.
Are you okay?

714
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,126
Oh, God.

715
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,128
I am so sorry
about Henry, okay?

716
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,845
I'm so sorry.

717
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,920
But we're gonna make it
through tonight, all right?

718
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,646
We will, and everything
is gonna be okay.

719
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,522
It's not gonna be okay.

720
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,321
What?

721
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,880
Look at what you're doing.

722
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,928
Nothing is ever
going to be okay again.

723
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,451
Don't say that.

724
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,763
Save your children.

725
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,244
Take me outside.

726
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,766
Charlie? Charlie!

727
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,083
I want all
these barricades down!

728
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,767
Get chains on every
door and every window!

729
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,001
James, where's Zoey?

730
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,047
I don't know, she ran out here.

731
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,724
Those freaks outside
are coming in!

732
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,370
They have chains on the
doors and windows.

733
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,408
They're gonna pull them
off and come inside.

734
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,561
Maybe you were right.

735
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,041
No, I wasn't right
about anything.

736
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,451
You're not sending him outside?

737
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,725
I have another idea.

738
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,040
What are you gonna do?

739
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,571
Charlie!

740
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,722
Charlie, listen to me.

741
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,245
You take this gun.

742
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,731
Dad, are you
sending him outside?

743
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,841
No. All right?

744
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,365
You're gonna go hide
in the basement

745
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,249
and you're not gonna come
out for anybody, all right?

746
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,765
Okay.
You're a good boy.

747
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,604
All right, go, go.

748
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,250
You just gave our son a gun.

749
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,971
You want to tell me
what the hell we're doing?

750
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,849
We're gonna fight.

751
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,809
I want you to take this one as well.
Safety's off.

752
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,605
You're gonna use
a lot of rounds.

753
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,284
What do I do?

754
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,362
You're gonna cover the
other side of the house.

755
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,329
This is our home.
Our kids live here.

756
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,050
Anybody tries to come
in, you blast them.

757
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,849
You will not hesitate.
Mmm.

758
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,282
Dear Mr. and Mrs.!

759
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,208
I'm sorry to tell you this, but
your time is essentially up.

760
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,884
And you failed!

761
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,963
You failed to deliver
the homeless swine!

762
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,847
I'm very disappointed as you
fine folk should know better!

763
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,083
That piece of filth
that you are protecting

764
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,051
exists only to serve
our need to Purge!

765
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,763
So, I bid thee farewell, sweet Sandins.

766
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,922
Release the beast, boys.
Let the killing commence!

767
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,406
Run!

768
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,970
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

769
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,122
Are you hurt?
No, I'm okay.

770
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,090
We've got to get out of here.

771
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,571
Come on, come on, come on.

772
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:37,167
Cooper, come
look at little lady Sandin.

773
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,687
She's exquisite.

774
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,523
Save her for me.

775
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,085
Dad.

776
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,806
Are you okay?
Yes, Dad, I'm okay.

777
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,120
You stay here, okay?

778
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,440
Are Mommy and Zoey okay?

779
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,170
Yeah, they're gonna be fine.

780
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,251
Mmm...

781
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,321
Shit.

782
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,606
Shit!

783
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,682
It's okay.

784
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,645
It's okay.

785
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,484
Your soul has been
cleansed, Mr. Sandin.

786
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,289
You've Purged.

787
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,290
Just one question for you.

788
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,081
Was his life
really worth yours?

789
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,964
Your family's?

790
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,529
Thank you for this unforgettable
Purge, Mr. Sandin.

791
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,441
No! No! No!

792
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,967
Get off!
Get off of me!

793
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,485
James!

794
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,889
Let go of me!
Please, don't!

795
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,760
Please don't kill me.
Please don't!

796
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,646
James!

797
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,960
Please, don't!
Please, don't!

798
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,087
Please!

799
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,681
James!

800
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,321
James!

801
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,050
Please!
Please, don't!

802
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,690
Don't! Please don't!

803
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,411
James.

804
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,165
James.

805
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,524
Charlie! Charlie!

806
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,090
Zoey!

807
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,290
Dad!

808
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,410
Sorry.

809
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,290
Thank you for your sacrifice.

810
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,001
You got a lot
of heart, Mr. Sandin.

811
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,804
Blessed be America...

812
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,366
A nation reborn.

813
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,924
I'm so sorry.

814
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,770
Thank you.

815
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,761
We saw that you were
having some trouble.

816
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,530
We decided to help you.

817
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,207
You saved us.
I don't know what to say.

818
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,207
Don't thank us too much, Mary.

819
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,521
The truth is, you're
ours, not theirs.

820
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,970
What do you mean "ours"?

821
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,680
What do you mean?
What do you mean "ours"?

822
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,081
Dad?

823
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,400
No, no, no!
Dad!

824
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,281
Wait! Wait!

825
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,361
Dad!

826
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,971
James is dead.

827
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,529
Mary and the kids
will have to do.

828
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,285
Let's tie them up. We'll
kill them right here.

829
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,921
No, no, no.
What do you mean?

830
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,365
Wait! Wait! Wait!

831
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,965
Come on.
No! No!

832
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,121
No!

833
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,288
No! No! No!

834
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,044
Mom! Mom!

835
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,046
Cali, get the tape!

836
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,848
Don't touch
my fucking children!

837
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,763
Don't you touch
my fucking kids!

838
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,840
Let them go!
Let them go!

839
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,685
Right now! You let
my fucking kids go!

840
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,762
Shut up, Mary!
Shut up!

841
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,001
Right now!

842
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,320
Mary! Shut up!

843
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,605
I swear to God, I will
shoot him right now.

844
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,926
Do you hear me?

845
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,285
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

846
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,646
Why are you doing
this right now?

847
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,531
When your barricades came down,

848
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,969
we saw an opportunity to cleanse
ourselves of our hatred.

849
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,849
You made so much
money off of us

850
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,491
and then you just
stuck it in our faces.

851
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,487
You all think
you're so damn perfect.

852
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,443
I just need you
to listen to me, Grace.

853
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,885
I'm really begging
you right now.

854
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,928
Do not do this to
my children, please.

855
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,764
They're my children, please.

856
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,604
Please, not my children.

857
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,160
I can't let you do that.

858
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,883
We have to, Mary. That's what
this night is all about.

859
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,846
I am begging you.
I'm really begging you.

860
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,850
I can't let you do this.

861
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,369
We'll be better people and you'll
have sacrificed yourselves

862
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,329
to make the world
a better place.

863
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,640
Mom...

864
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:36,927
Mom!

865
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,729
You're frightening them.

866
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,930
Please don't.

867
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,650
Please let me hold my children.

868
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,291
Mary, no, no.
It's over.

869
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,486
Untie them.
It's over.

870
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,483
Please untie my hands.
Hmm?

871
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,566
Grace?

872
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,649
It's time for you
to quiet down, Mary,

873
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,200
and let us do
our duty as Americans.

874
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,321
Mom.

875
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,083
Sweetheart...

876
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,047
Zoey, look at me, okay?
Just look at your mama.

877
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,043
Just look at me.
Just look at me.

878
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,442
Blessed be
the New Founding Fathers

879
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,411
for letting us Purge
and cleanse our souls.

880
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,970
Blessed be America...

881
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:32,890
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

882
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,129
I'll go first and then...

883
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,970
We'll take turns.

884
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,801
Timmy?

885
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,730
Don't move.

886
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,803
Drop your weapons right now.

887
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,050
Untie them, let's go.

888
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,281
Right now.

889
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,570
Your call.

890
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,209
Just get it over with.

891
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,649
Kill us quickly.

892
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,046
No.

893
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,482
Oh, for God's sake!
Just do it!

894
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,244
Come on!

895
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,366
Mom, they were going to kill us.

896
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,965
It doesn't matter.

897
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,485
We are gonna play the rest of this
night out in motherfucking peace.

898
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,401
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

899
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,331
Did you enjoy
Grace's Purge party...

900
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,203
Mr. Halverson?

901
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,806
Go fuck yourself.

902
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,689
Sorry, I can't hear you.

903
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,602
It was very nice.

904
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,920
Oh, good.

905
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,447
I'm glad you all
had a grand time.

906
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,007
Didn't you hear what I said?
No more killing tonight!

907
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,371
Is it that hard to understand?

908
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,648
Oh, my...

909
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,485
Now get the hell
out of my house.

910
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,327
Wait.

911
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,963
Are you going to be okay?

912
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,564
Thank you.

913
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,930
Good luck.

914
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,365
<i>Just
after 7:00 AM, March 22nd,</i>

915
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,171
<i>the Annual Purge
has just concluded.</i>

916
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,090
<i>This is your American
morning news program.</i>

917
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,527
<i>And reports are coming in
from all around the country</i>

918
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,763
<i>as police, firefighters
and paramedics...</i>

919
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,730
<i>The New Founding Fathers
have released an early statement saying</i>

920
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,280
<i>this was the most
successful Purge yet.</i>

921
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,691
<i>I am walking...</i>

922
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,003
<i>I should say "stumbling"
through downtown Los Angeles,</i>

923
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,050
<i>and there are literally
bodies everywhere.</i>

924
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,565
<i>I witnessed
a group of young men</i>

925
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,880
<i>breaking into
the tenement next to me,</i>

926
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,803
<i>and they were
dragging people out</i>

927
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,360
<i>and just executing
them on the street.</i>

928
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,761
<i>Hundreds
have gathered in Times Square</i>

929
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,126
<i>for a public vigil</i>

930
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,567
<i>thanking all those
who were killed last night</i>

931
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:03,361
<i>for their sacrifice to make
this country a safer place.</i>

932
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,044
<i>They are turning people away</i>

933
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,963
<i>from emergency rooms
in Brownsville</i>

934
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,486
<i>as there is simply
no more room.</i>

935
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,971
<i>The markets
were up this morning</i>

936

<i>as both gun and
home security system</i>

937

<i>while our thoughts
are still fresh.</i>

942
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,325
<i>From what I've been reading, it seems
like Dallas had the most participants.</i>

943
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,404
<i>I did get a chance to see some
live surveillance footage</i>

<i>out of Dallas, Forest Lawn,</i>

945

<i>Purging at the same time.</i>

947
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,168
<i>Never saw anything like this.</i>

948
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,761
<i>I lost my two sons last night.</i>
