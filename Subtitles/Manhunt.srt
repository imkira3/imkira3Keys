2
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,748
Good evening.

3
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:51,465
Where's the boss?
She's not feeling well today.

4
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:55,123
We also ran out of Sake.
Please come again.

5
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:59,206
Dawn.
We still have a bottle left.

6
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:04,456
Shall I warm it up?

7
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,215
Great! Thanks.

8
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:08,756
You are Chinese?

9
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:12,090
You speak Chinese?
A little.

10
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,881
I know a little of everything.

11
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:17,631
That's good.
Makes life easier.

12
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:21,848
Knowing too much can be a burden.

13
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:29,290
You come here often?

14
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,615
After all these years,
nothing much has changed.

15
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:36,823
People are still friendly.

16
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:41,131
I come here at this time every year.

17
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:44,040
Everything here

18
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,890
reminds me of those film classics.

19
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:11,606
I remember some of the lines.

20
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:19,231
"Sometimes a man
must face death when he flies."

21
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:21,698
"Look!"

22
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:24,465
"See how blue the sky is."

23
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:29,781
"Over there,
you'll blend in with the blue sky."

24
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:33,765
"Keep walking straight.
Don't look sideways."

25
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,831
You watched that film too?

26
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,523
What are you doing?

27
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,323
I'm a lawyer.
You need any help?

28
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,823
Tell him to get lost.
You two come drink with us.

29
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:57,273
Sure.

30
00:03:57,815 --> 00:04:03,082
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Dinner is ready. This way, please.

31
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,598
What the hell
are you looking at?

32
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:08,190
Hurry up, bitch!

33
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:13,215
You really don't need help?

34
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:16,190
Please stay out of this.

35
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,673
Nobody talks about
classic films anymore.

36
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:23,273
They're too long.

37
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:28,006
By the way, I have a DVD
of a classic film in my car.

38
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:30,424
I can give it to you.
Thanks.

39
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:32,448
Go get it now.

40
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,848
Sure.

41
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,315
Bring the wine, bitch!

42
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:44,565
Money will keep rolling in.
Definitely!

43
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,240
Yep, it's definitely him.

44
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,690
Here you go, Father.

45
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:30,031
Your friend won't
have to pay him off anymore.

46
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:32,874
God dammit. That guy almost
ruined everything.

47
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:37,806
It was fate. We were just
having a chat about an old movie.

48
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:54,565
Be careful.
Sometimes movie talk

49
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,881
is just a come on.

50
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,440
Let's go.

51
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Retail Revision by:
Jan de Uitvreter.

52
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,256
Our president, Mr. Yoshihiro Sakai,

53
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:14,606
will say a few words.

54
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:21,731
Thanks for coming and help me
celebrate this very memorable day,

55
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:25,398
the 65th anniversary of
Tenjin Pharmaceutical.

56
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:31,581
Tenjin has made enormous progress
because of your support.

57
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:36,465
I would like to extend
my special thanks to Mr. Du Qiu,

58
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:39,106
the brilliant international lawyer.

59
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:44,581
Three years ago,
we faced a tricky lawsuit

60
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:48,315
and he won it for us.

61
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:50,840
Without him,

62
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:56,015
Tenjin Pharmaceutical could not
have been listed on the NYSE.

63
00:07:57,148 --> 00:08:00,423
Du-San.
Thank you very much.

64
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:04,423
Congratulations!
Thank you! Thank you.

65
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:07,356
Separately,
I'm also particularly pleased to say

66
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:13,023
my son will take over
the development of a new drug

67
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:17,315
and replace me as the new President.

68
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:20,640
I believe he'll do an outstanding job.

69
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:26,090
I hope you'll support him,
like you have supported me.

70
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,831
Please show him the ropes.

71
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,981
Father. Thank you!
Mr. President! Congratulations!

72
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,465
Mr. Sakai.
Du-San.

73
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:58,715
Are you sure
you must go to the States?

74
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:02,291
I'm sorry!
It's my management's decision.

75
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:03,606
I see.

76
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:07,540
Please keep our secrets.

77
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:15,490
Asano-San, you're finally here.
Hello, Aoki-San!

78
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,124
What about the investigation
on missing persons?

79
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:19,590
It has been taken care of.

80
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,999
Thank you for taking care
of the blackmailers for him.

81
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:27,765
He also said when you had time,
he'd like to play golf with you.

82
00:09:29,856 --> 00:09:31,631
Sir, Asano-San is here.

83
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:34,131
Asano-San!
Congratulations!

84
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,999
I've been waiting for you.
You can finally prove your worth.

85
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,023
Not really.

86
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,481
I know you don't like shots.

87
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:43,073
I made you

88
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:44,581
pills.

89
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:47,606
It's just as exhilarating.

90
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:56,148
A lawyer proficient in drugs is rare.

91
00:09:57,148 --> 00:10:00,565
I hope Du Qiu would stay.

92
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,256
Stay, I need you.

93
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:22,573
Give me some hope.

94
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,298
See you in a bit.

95
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:53,306
Chinese?

96
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:57,581
How did you know?

97
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:00,865
The Qipao only looks
good on Chinese women.

98
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:02,290
Thanks.

99
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,773
My Mom is Chinese.

100
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:16,956
Don't you find this boring?
Let's talk somewhere else.

101
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,621
You know Sakai well?

102
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:27,181
Don't know him. I don't like
to hear his name either.

103
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:30,356
I came here to see you.

104
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,723
But I don't even know you.
What do you want with me?

105
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:39,256
You won a lot of lawsuits for Tenjin

106
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:42,356
and know too many secrets.

107
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,999
They're not as clean as
they appear to be, right?

108
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,590
As a professional lawyer, when
I take on a case, my job is to win it.

109
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,148
I don't care about anything else.

110
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:55,431
Do you ever have doubts
about your cases?

111
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,423
Which one?

112
00:11:57,523 --> 00:12:01,731
Three years ago
the one Sakai just mentioned.

113
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,198
Thanks.

114
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,381
Let's meet again.

115
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:56,215
About the case you just mentioned,
I'd like to hear more.

116
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,723
Okay.

117
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:03,291
The day after tomorrow at 3pm.,
Time & Space Plaza at the Osaka Station.

118
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,481
What's your name?

119
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:10,048
Mayumi Tohnami.
Please call me Mayumi.

120
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,098
Okay.

121
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:36,906
Is this 110?

122
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:40,231
Let me transfer you to our English service.
Just a moment.

123
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:03,206
This man!

124
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:05,781
He's the killer!

125
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:09,848
Who are you?
I have never seen you before.

126
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:13,041
She's dead.
The body is stiff.

127
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:17,756
The police collecting evidence at the scene.
A young woman is found dead on the bed.

128
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:22,440
I'm Yuji Asano, from the Osaka
Prefectural Police, Division I.

129
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:25,673
Tell me what happened.
Did you know the victim?

130
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:29,856
Did you have a special relationship
with the victim?

131
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,615
I want a lawyer.

132
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:39,298
The suspect was caught
on the spot. The victim,

133
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,707
a 28-year old female
was found dead on the bed.

134
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:44,173
Inspector, this place is
filled with reporters.

135
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:50,298
Take the front door to distract the press. We'll
take him out the backside and distract the press.

136
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:55,023
The police is escorting the suspect
from the crime scene.

137
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:13,415
You killed someone,
attacked a police officer and took his gun.

138
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:17,731
Run now.
It will be your last chance.

139
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:27,590
The suspect resisted arrest and got away!
Over there!

140
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,065
The suspect escaped!

141
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:56,673
Hey!
Stop!

142
00:16:56,773 --> 00:16:59,490
Out of the way!
Stop!

143
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,856
The train for Nara
will pass through on platform 2.

144
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:39,506
For your safety,
please stand behind the yellow line.

145
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:03,781
Damn it!
Inspector!

146
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,006
Tsuji!
Yes!

147
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:12,006
Seal off all the exits along this route.
Call for backup!

148
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,890
Yes, Sir!

149
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:19,923
Two unidentified radicals
are holding a grade-schooler hostage,

150
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:21,965
they want 20 million
dollar and a helicopter.

151
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:25,581
Stay calm, everyone.
The situation is critical.

152
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,390
Coming to you live at the scene.

153
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:38,090
Do as we say!
The truck is about to blow!

154
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,999
We'll blow up this brat
and the whole damn neighbourhood.

155
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:47,331
We need time to fill your request.
Let us hear his voice to ensure he's safe.

156
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:49,931
Stop stalling, asshole!

157
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,506
Let the TV reporter in.
Hurry!

158
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:59,923
I dare you to shoot!

159
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,356
Who are you?

160
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,916
I'm a freelance reporter.

161
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,965
Yamura.
Stay back or I'll shoot.

162
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:21,515
Let me put you on a live cast online.

163
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:24,416
Let the whole world see.
Stay back!

164
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,215
Go ahead and shoot me.
In the meantime,

165
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:33,582
let me show them how I got shot

166
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,373
in a live cast.

167
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:39,415
I came here

168
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,456
well prepared.

169
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:49,249
An international live cast?

170
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,581
Yes.

171
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:55,423
Your names will be known
to the world.

172
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:57,106
Hi, I...

173
00:20:08,065 --> 00:20:12,256
How can I be a man like you?

174
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:16,548
Whether it's something
you should do, or don't want to do,

175
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,815
do it anyway.

176
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,006
I want to be a policeman just like you.

177
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:30,673
Whatever job you do,
never run from it.

178
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:31,981
Hmm.

179
00:20:35,356 --> 00:20:38,073
Take over!
Yes, Sir!

180
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:43,856
Inspector Yamura,
I'm Rika Hyakuta from the regional office.

181
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:50,416
I'm assigned to the Osaka Prefecture Police
and will work with you under the CID.

182
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,256
Chief Ito wants us to back-up
Inspector Asano right now.

183
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:54,898
Key!

184
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:02,848
The suspect is Du Qiu,
age 40, Chinese male, a lawyer

185
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:06,590
for Tenjin Pharmaceutical who
shuttles between China and Osaka.

186
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,890
Inspector Asano posted officers at all
the station exits along the subway line.

187
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:26,041
Sir, Chief Ito wants us
to join Inspector Asano.

188
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:30,465
If he had the subway station surrounded,
what's the point of going over there?

189
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:32,656
Then what should we do?

190
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:36,006
Open the map.
Yes, Sir!

191
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,182
Inspector, we searched the
tunnel where the suspect

192
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:41,791
jumped off the platform.
We didn't find anything.

193
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:44,790
The First Tactical Unit has arrived.

194
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,840
The suspect is highly dangerous.
We must catch him before he kills again.

195
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,981
If necessary, shoot to kill.

196
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:30,098
It's safe now.

197
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:40,291
Sir, this place is not on the map.
It's still under construction.

198
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:44,123
But, it's connected
to Uehommachi Station.

199
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:40,765
Are you all right?

200
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:42,323
Thank you.

201
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:46,073
I'll help you clean up. Be careful.

202
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:19,131
Let her go! Let her go!
What are you doing!

203
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:23,523
Hey! Stay back!
Further back!

204
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:29,398
Hey!
Put it down!

205
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:33,240
I said, put it down!

206
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:37,381
Hey!

207
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:39,448
Put it down.

208
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:41,715
Put it down!

209
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,707
No.
You put that down.

210
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:48,540
You really want to shoot
a hole in her face?

211
00:24:56,981 --> 00:25:00,723
You can't go anywhere with that idiot.

212
00:25:01,898 --> 00:25:06,006
It's her first day.
Give her a break.

213
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,815
Take me instead.

214
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,665
It's dangerous. Stay back!

215
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:30,356
So now you're the idiot.

216
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:34,315
I just want her to know
you can't trust lawyers.

217
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,206
You don't know me.
Yes, I do.

218
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:41,856
Three years ago, I remember.

219
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:44,456
I was framed.

220
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:48,473
Then come with me.
Tell me the truth.

221
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:51,207
I don't trust cops.

222
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:53,823
Move! Get me a car!

223
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:57,123
Take off the handcuffs.

224
00:25:58,648 --> 00:26:01,481
You won't get away with this.

225
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,090
Drive!

226
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:14,990
You didn't say where we're going.
Shut up! Keep driving.

227
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,206
If I go back with you,

228
00:27:55,315 --> 00:27:56,990
I'm dead.

229
00:27:57,148 --> 00:28:00,082
There's only one end for a fugitive.

230
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:02,123
A dead end.

231
00:28:02,773 --> 00:28:05,681
You still have a choice now.

232
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,390
How humiliating!

233
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:28,291
The fingerprints on the murder weapon and
the DNA of the hair found on the deceased

234
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:31,665
are enough to prove he's the killer.

235
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:38,765
As long as we catch him, we can close file.
What is Du Qiu's motive?

236
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:42,215
The crime scene is his apartment.

237
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:45,548
The fingerprints and hair sample
are not conclusive evidence.

238
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:48,749
You let him go,
don't try to cover for him!

239
00:28:48,773 --> 00:28:53,873
Inspector was trying to save me.
You let him get away first.

240
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,706
What did you say?
Hyakuta.

241
00:28:57,898 --> 00:29:00,415
Don't speak out of turn.

242
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,256
Sorry.

243
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:04,756
Yamura! Asano!

244
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:09,148
You must work together.

245
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:15,598
Can we have a word?

246
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:20,256
Yamura.
Regardless of how brilliant you are,

247
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,098
people still don't understand you.

248
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:26,056
But

249
00:29:26,523 --> 00:29:31,098
you'll always have my support.
Keep it going.

250
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:57,965
In pursuit of the suspect Du Qiu...

251
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,590
This morning a Chinese male...

252
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,707
the Osaka Police
carried out a manhunt...

253
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:02,548
is suspected of murdering

254
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:04,006
a local woman in his apartment.

255
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:07,673
The suspect resisted arrest
and escaped.

256
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,256
The Osaka police released...

257
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:12,965
The paradox is
the evidence is too perfect.

258
00:30:13,065 --> 00:30:18,815
Yes! The suspect is a brilliant
lawyer, why would he do such a thing?

259
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:21,707
You feel sorry for him?

260
00:30:21,731 --> 00:30:25,166
There are too many things
you can't explain.

261
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,865
Well... I think you have a point.

262
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:31,140
Don't smile.

263
00:30:32,606 --> 00:30:34,231
Yes, Sir.

264
00:30:34,356 --> 00:30:36,106
What about the CCTV?

265
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:39,999
We secured the CCTV
from outside the venue.

266
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:45,590
The victim Kiko Tanaka left
by herself at 22:15. At 23:36,

267
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,298
Du Qiu left with another woman.

268
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,790
Another woman?

269
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,973
Zoom in and let me see.

270
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:57,273
Enhance it.

271
00:31:02,565 --> 00:31:10,323
Three years ago, her fiancé was charged and
convicted of stealing Tenjin trade secrets.

272
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:14,381
Afterwards, he died.

273
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:35,415
Masaki

274
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,273
didn't commit suicide.

275
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:46,390
He was hounded to death

276
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:48,998
by that lawyer.

277
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:08,565
Wait!

278
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:20,215
That guy up there looks like him!
Hey! Stop!

279
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,856
Cheers!
Thanks.

280
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:30,015
Sorry.

281
00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:36,706
Hungry?

282
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:40,065
Try it. Eat this.

283
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:42,815
Thanks.

284
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:47,190
Police! Don't move!
Don't move!

285
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:52,123
Have you seen this man?
No.

286
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:54,082
Don't worry.

287
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:57,106
They are my friends.

288
00:32:57,648 --> 00:33:00,781
Thanks.
You know who I am?

289
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:05,981
I saw the TV news.
You don't look like a killer.

290
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,090
Morning.

291
00:33:39,273 --> 00:33:42,390
You can use this towel.

292
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,231
It's hot.

293
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,531
Where is that idiot from
the regional office?

294
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,173
Here I am.

295
00:33:56,023 --> 00:33:59,881
There you are.
Well? How do I look?

296
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:03,248
I put on something more formal.

297
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:06,923
I spent all night
digging up Du Qiu's past.

298
00:34:07,023 --> 00:34:11,381
Born in Qingdao, China in 1976,
he got his law degree at Columbia.

299
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:14,698
He also studied pharmaceutical law.

300
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,181
Listen.

301
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:19,615
From now on, you're Du Qiu.

302
00:34:19,898 --> 00:34:24,773
Feel what he's feeling.
Think what he's thinking.

303
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,865
The rest is for reference only.

304
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,098
The stab wound was inflicted
after she was dead.

305
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:51,006
If the time of death
was around midnight,

306
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,015
he had plenty of time
before daybreak to run away.

307
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,965
Did the killer

308
00:34:57,148 --> 00:35:01,190
sleep next to the body till dawn?

309
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:03,173
Or...

310
00:35:03,523 --> 00:35:07,023
Was it a deliberate set-up?

311
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,173
I think it's a set-up.

312
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:12,298
Traces left at the scene

313
00:35:12,398 --> 00:35:14,848
will lead us to the truth.

314
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:22,556
The victim was not
attacked on the bed.

315
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:26,840
She was moved there after she was dead.

316
00:35:29,023 --> 00:35:32,665
She knew Du Qiu
and had access to his apartment.

317
00:35:32,815 --> 00:35:36,548
We only found her fingerprints
on the zipper and buttons of her clothes.

318
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:40,106
That means she took them off herself.

319
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:44,706
Her fingerprints were also found
on the turntable and wine glass.

320
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:49,606
She was drinking and listening
to music while waiting for him.

321
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:55,973
Du Qiu was still out.
But she was confident

322
00:35:56,315 --> 00:35:59,756
this man would fall under her charm.

323
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:05,156
The blood on the carpet near the desk
belonged to the victim.

324
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:10,916
There was probably a fierce
struggle with the killer.

325
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:16,398
She was looking out the window
from here, waiting for the killer.

326
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:29,465
When the killer showed up,
the mood has changed.

327
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:31,957
It was no longer a romantic evening.

328
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:36,506
Something provoked
the killer to kill her.

329
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:39,215
She was first attacked near the desk.

330
00:36:39,356 --> 00:36:43,582
Based on the ligature marks on the neck,
the killer strangled her with a tie.

331
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:47,765
But this tie was not found at the scene.

332
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:53,374
She grabbed the curtains
to break from the killer's grasp.

333
00:36:53,398 --> 00:36:59,281
This point can be verified
by the fibers in her nails.

334
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,165
Calm down!

335
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:25,999
Calm down!

336
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:27,165
Hey!

337
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,131
Don't cry.

338
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:36,973
It's not over yet.

339
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,315
The killer is left-handed.

340
00:38:18,315 --> 00:38:21,831
Maybe there was someone else at the scene.

341
00:38:22,023 --> 00:38:25,665
It's possible Du Qiu is innocent.

342
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:34,765
Those of you looking a job...

343
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:39,590
We only want 10 people.
Queue up if you want the job.

344
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,832
One by one, we'll give a check-up.

345
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:47,340
This black van comes by every two
or three days to recruit workers.

346
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,582
It's rather popular.

347
00:38:49,606 --> 00:38:54,890
What kind of job is it?
I heard they're doing research

348
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:59,916
for a pharmaceutical company.
They pay good money.

349
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,523
Those who went with them
never came back.

350
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:10,381
I have to go.
I have something important to do.

351
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:12,207
There's a saying:

352
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:17,731
You can lose anything,
but don't lose your heart.

353
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:23,840
We're conducting a search.
Please work with us.

354
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:30,490
Hey you!
Stop! Come here!

355
00:39:30,773 --> 00:39:33,787
The one wearing a red shirt!

356
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:38,273
Stay where you are!

357
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:48,981
Let me go!

358
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:05,931
This case can't be delayed.
Our reputation damage is unthinkable.

359
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:11,440
Put pressure on the police.
Let them solve the case soon.

360
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:15,548
We're paying you good money.
Why didn't you get this done?

361
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:17,148
Mr. President,

362
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,373
there's a call for you.

363
00:40:21,606 --> 00:40:24,681
Hello?
Mr. Sakai.

364
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:26,223
Du-San?

365
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:30,957
I'm sure you've been expecting
my call. Perhaps we should meet.

366
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:33,256
How about at 12,

367
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,106
at La Mélodie?

368
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,381
Find out how much he knows.

369
00:40:44,523 --> 00:40:48,041
I don't care how, make him talk.
Don't let the police catch him.

370
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:51,832
Great! If we finish off Du Qiu

371
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:54,148
the case is closed.

372
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:02,731
"La Mélodie"

373
00:41:03,315 --> 00:41:05,973
It's the name.

374
00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:21,124
I want to get off these drugs!
Such a miserable life!

375
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:26,081
I don't like watching you suffer...
This is the last one. I promise.

376
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:43,556
Take a look,

377
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,156
our next target.

378
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,806
If you can't do it,
I'll do it myself.

379
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:16,340
What would you like?

380
00:42:17,398 --> 00:42:18,541
What is it?

381
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:23,590
New lead. Aoki, the lawyer who works with
Du Qiu just left the Tenjin headquarters.

382
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,957
Aoki?
He is connected to the case?

383
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:32,748
Yes. Asano put a tail on anyone
connected to Du Qiu.

384
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:38,065
Welcome!

385
00:42:38,565 --> 00:42:40,940
What would you like?

386
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:43,582
Coffee.

387
00:42:43,606 --> 00:42:45,606
Iced or hot?

388
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:48,606
Iced.
Very well.

389
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:56,957
You came alone?

390
00:42:56,981 --> 00:42:59,281
Where's the President?

391
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:17,298
Stop the car!

392
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:20,198
Back up...
Back up!

393
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:25,815
Sir! Asano and his team
are near La Mélodie.

394
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:30,916
As your friend I must tell you the more
you know, the more dangerous it will be.

395
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:37,148
I believe you didn't kill Kiko.
Do you know who set you up?

396
00:43:37,606 --> 00:43:38,666
No.

397
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,523
I think you're in this mess
because you're leaving Tenjin.

398
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:49,840
They colluded with Aether, a private fund
to develop new drugs with inhuman means.

399
00:43:49,981 --> 00:43:55,465
Remember the Kitagawa case?
He stole the formula

400
00:43:55,565 --> 00:44:01,931
that was crucial to the new drug.
I heard it was a drug for the military.

401
00:44:03,648 --> 00:44:07,306
What's the problem?
Take him out.

402
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:12,023
I'm a lawyer.
You need any help?

403
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:14,332
I can't get a clear shot.

404
00:44:14,356 --> 00:44:17,541
That's against the Convention
on Psychotropic Substances.

405
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:19,231
Shoot him!

406
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:22,615
Key people who left Tenjin...

407
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:27,040
Shoot him!

408
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:38,423
Why do I always have to do everything?

409
00:44:42,815 --> 00:44:45,356
No!
Out of the way!

410
00:44:55,815 --> 00:44:57,148
No!

411
00:45:03,606 --> 00:45:05,106
Police!

412
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:16,473
Damn it!

413
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,881
Sir! Bad news.
What?

414
00:45:35,981 --> 00:45:37,965
Aoki is dead.

415
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:06,416
Watch out!
Get out of my way!

416
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,706
What are you doing?

417
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:31,681
Damn it!

418
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:39,090
Okay, you might be innocent, but
we have to work together.

419
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:43,291
You cops are all crooked.
That Asano tried to kill me.

420
00:47:43,315 --> 00:47:45,999
You have no reason not to trust me.

421
00:47:46,023 --> 00:47:48,398
No reason?
Yes.

422
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:51,115
No way!

423
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:23,815
Stop! Come back!

424
00:48:25,398 --> 00:48:28,856
What is it? Let me go!

425
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:36,356
Sorry!

426
00:48:37,606 --> 00:48:39,865
Hey... Stop!

427
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:46,231
In the summer heat, use
our misty spray to chill out.

428
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,998
Join us for some fun!

429
00:49:21,023 --> 00:49:23,556
I really didn't kill anyone.

430
00:49:26,148 --> 00:49:29,365
I hope you can be my alibi.

431
00:49:29,606 --> 00:49:35,273
You can prove on the night that
woman was killed, I was with you.

432
00:49:50,398 --> 00:49:53,673
We don't fall in love, Rain.
That's not what we do.

433
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:57,948
He's the first man
to do something nice for me...

434
00:49:59,856 --> 00:50:01,631
What are you, five?

435
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:05,440
You should just go back
to the children's home.

436
00:50:05,773 --> 00:50:08,473
I just want to be normal.

437
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,798
It's too late for that.

438
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,340
Dawn,

439
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:25,473
don't waste time being angry.
We never know which day will be our last.

440
00:50:28,606 --> 00:50:31,023
Do you like the soup?

441
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,998
There's a new job.
I'm doing this one alone.

442
00:50:43,148 --> 00:50:46,798
I don't want your feelings
getting in the way again.

443
00:50:47,315 --> 00:50:52,131
That guy is blatantly
running around in broad daylight.

444
00:50:52,398 --> 00:50:54,840
Is he testing us?

445
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,498
Or...
he's just a fool.

446
00:50:59,273 --> 00:51:00,698
Yamura.

447
00:51:00,815 --> 00:51:06,298
With a shooting rampage, people
are running scared in Osaka.

448
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:08,931
There's more to this case.

449
00:51:09,273 --> 00:51:12,416
There's a dark force behind it.

450
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,240
Let the little fish bait the big fish.

451
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,948
I see.

452
00:51:22,606 --> 00:51:25,023
We found Du Qiu.

453
00:51:28,398 --> 00:51:32,498
Let me see her face again.
What's going on?

454
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:35,690
He's with that woman again.

455
00:51:36,565 --> 00:51:39,981
Their meeting at the station...

456
00:51:40,273 --> 00:51:42,240
was not accidental.

457
00:51:59,398 --> 00:52:02,156
Get back to work.
Okay.

458
00:52:02,315 --> 00:52:04,957
Miss Mayumi,
what is he doing here?

459
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:10,523
Ayana-San! Get him a room and
a suit. Guess he's hungry, too.

460
00:52:10,656 --> 00:52:14,006
But...
Just do as I say.

461
00:52:14,106 --> 00:52:14,999
Yes.

462
00:52:15,023 --> 00:52:19,723
We'll talk in the morning.
Get some rest.

463
00:52:25,106 --> 00:52:26,923
Your room is upstairs.

464
00:52:27,023 --> 00:52:31,190
Miss Mayumi doesn't want anyone
near that room.

465
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,523
Don't push me.

466
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:52,998
What should I do?

467
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,673
You haven't slept for days.

468
00:52:58,815 --> 00:53:02,291
Don't torture yourself
It hasn't happened yet.

469
00:53:02,315 --> 00:53:05,490
I developed that drug to save lives.

470
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:10,381
I don't want them to use my formula

471
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:12,465
to do anything illegal.

472
00:53:30,523 --> 00:53:32,990
I'm taking you somewhere.

473
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,990
I want you to remember forever.

474
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:48,105
Remember Masaki Kitagawa
who was charged for theft?

475
00:53:48,106 --> 00:53:49,790
My fiancé

476
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:52,965
was...

477
00:54:03,315 --> 00:54:05,999
I'm Yamura from the Osaka Police.

478
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:11,565
I'm investigating a murder case.
I wish to see the lady of the house.

479
00:54:20,231 --> 00:54:23,448
Please hold each other's hand.

480
00:54:23,606 --> 00:54:25,198
Three years ago,

481
00:54:25,315 --> 00:54:28,065
I could have been like them.

482
00:54:33,648 --> 00:54:35,648
On April 3,

483
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:39,448
the day after the court
passed the sentence,

484
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,898
I was standing right there,

485
00:54:42,273 --> 00:54:46,348
waiting for him to show up,
waiting for my blessings,

486
00:54:46,481 --> 00:54:49,298
waiting for my wonderful life to begin.

487
00:54:52,398 --> 00:54:57,681
I thought I could get married while
the cherry blossoms were in bloom.

488
00:54:58,065 --> 00:55:02,306
But they have fallen earlier
than usual that year.

489
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:45,456
The day he lost the lawsuit,

490
00:55:45,648 --> 00:55:48,073
he only said one thing.

491
00:55:49,023 --> 00:55:52,165
You'll find out sooner or later.

492
00:55:52,356 --> 00:55:56,506
Perhaps only my death
can prove everything.

493
00:55:57,356 --> 00:55:59,165
I'm sorry.

494
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:03,540
Sorry?

495
00:56:06,065 --> 00:56:08,440
Masaki told me

496
00:56:08,648 --> 00:56:10,515
it was you.

497
00:56:10,898 --> 00:56:13,523
You accused him
of stealing the formula.

498
00:56:13,648 --> 00:56:16,006
Do you know why?

499
00:56:16,523 --> 00:56:20,123
Because Sakai was killing people
with the new drug!

500
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:25,556
You think what you know
is the truth?

501
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:12,331
You're hurt?

502
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,123
Just my leg.

503
00:57:14,315 --> 00:57:17,098
It's Okay, I got my meds.

504
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:21,023
Think we can still catch up with him?
Yeah!

505
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:25,131
When I see that cop again,
I'm gonna kill him.

506
00:57:25,231 --> 00:57:28,690
I should call for backup,
just in case.

507
00:57:30,773 --> 00:57:34,373
It's him!
He followed us from Osaka.

508
00:58:30,856 --> 00:58:32,723
Are you Okay?

509
00:58:49,023 --> 00:58:50,806
Are you Okay?

510
00:58:53,023 --> 00:58:53,923
Hey!

511
00:58:54,023 --> 00:58:55,332
What the...

512
00:58:55,356 --> 00:58:56,656
Don't!

513
00:59:03,148 --> 00:59:04,848
Damn it!

514
00:59:05,023 --> 00:59:09,565
You know who he is! Why are you
with him? I won't spare him.

515
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,073
Get down!

516
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:47,090
Does anyone not wanna kill you?

517
00:59:47,523 --> 00:59:50,023
Happy about this now?

518
00:59:50,273 --> 00:59:54,423
Before I met you,
my life was great.

519
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:58,923
We're stuck together.
Let's be gentlemen.

520
00:59:59,356 --> 01:00:01,148
Of course.

521
01:00:02,356 --> 01:00:04,781
Hey! Watch it!

522
01:00:04,981 --> 01:00:08,798
Sorry, Grandma.
But I'm taking you in.

523
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:11,131
Now it looks like we're together.

524
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:14,740
If I have to drag your dead body back,

525
01:00:14,856 --> 01:00:16,665
I will.

526
01:00:22,606 --> 01:00:27,723
Tell him on the night Kiko
was killed, I was with you.

527
01:00:28,231 --> 01:00:32,590
Tell her. The police gave all
the evidence in the Kitagawa case.

528
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,331
I never set up her man!

529
01:00:39,815 --> 01:00:41,606
You were together

530
01:00:41,773 --> 01:00:44,381
the night Kiko was killed?

531
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:49,548
Is this guy

532
01:00:49,648 --> 01:00:52,465
telling the truth?

533
01:00:53,023 --> 01:00:56,673
Whether I go to jail depends on you.

534
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,423
That night,

535
01:01:02,815 --> 01:01:06,381
I was with him

536
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:09,556
till around 1 a.m.

537
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:13,840
You're his alibi?

538
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,248
Yes.

539
01:01:18,148 --> 01:01:20,291
Thanks for clearing my name.

540
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:24,473
Don't give me that.
Let's wait till we get out alive.

541
01:01:32,023 --> 01:01:35,856
What happened to you?
Never mind. Follow me.

542
01:01:36,023 --> 01:01:38,315
Inspector?
Get inside!

543
01:01:38,565 --> 01:01:41,765
What's going on?
Stay away from the window!

544
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:45,940
Go upstairs and stay down.
Don't go near the window!

545
01:01:50,023 --> 01:01:51,531
Strange!

546
01:01:52,398 --> 01:01:57,398
A cop and the killers always
at the same place and at the same time.

547
01:01:59,773 --> 01:02:03,231
I don't want to die here, with you.

548
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,031
Neither do I.

549
01:02:10,523 --> 01:02:13,999
You know how to use that?

550
01:02:14,023 --> 01:02:19,073
Of course! I've been hunting
with my Dad since I was 6.

551
01:02:31,731 --> 01:02:33,548
Back up!

552
01:02:58,856 --> 01:03:00,440
Come on!

553
01:03:21,273 --> 01:03:22,856
Over here!

554
01:04:13,606 --> 01:04:15,590
For his sake,

555
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:18,906
brace yourself!

556
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:34,948
It's your turn.
I can't.

557
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:36,832
I'm right-handed.

558
01:04:36,856 --> 01:04:39,615
Today, you're left-handed.

559
01:04:39,773 --> 01:04:43,973
I can't kill someone.
Just shoot the feet.

560
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:48,415
I'll get the rest.

561
01:05:07,398 --> 01:05:08,740
Go!

562
01:05:35,856 --> 01:05:37,423
Ayana-San!

563
01:06:36,815 --> 01:06:38,098
Hurry!

564
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:02,206
Get down!

565
01:07:03,356 --> 01:07:04,756
Yamura-San!

566
01:07:05,315 --> 01:07:07,523
Quick! To the hospital!

567
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:09,565
Inspector Yamura!

568
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:13,248
Dawn!

569
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,315
Wake up! Wake up, Dawn!

570
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,765
Dawn!

571
01:07:18,148 --> 01:07:21,798
The new drug father gave
me is too strong...

572
01:07:22,106 --> 01:07:24,215
I can't feel a thing.

573
01:07:24,481 --> 01:07:27,190
You're gonna make it, Dawn.

574
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,240
Are you Okay?

575
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:53,165
Hyakuta.
Yes.

576
01:07:53,315 --> 01:07:54,856
Take it off.

577
01:07:58,106 --> 01:07:59,590
Take it off.

578
01:08:02,065 --> 01:08:03,348
Okay.

579
01:08:07,523 --> 01:08:10,340
Get the doctor.
Right!

580
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:13,790
You were never with me today.

581
01:08:14,273 --> 01:08:15,973
Were you?

582
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:17,306
No.

583
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:23,515
You're free now!

584
01:08:25,231 --> 01:08:26,556
Go!

585
01:08:32,523 --> 01:08:35,090
Don't worry.
I'm not dead yet.

586
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,590
Are you Okay?

587
01:08:36,606 --> 01:08:38,615
We'll take over from here.

588
01:08:38,731 --> 01:08:40,731
Grab his legs.

589
01:08:48,773 --> 01:08:51,806
The bullet shot through his body
and came out in the back.

590
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,791
He's out of danger for now.
I'll let you know when he comes around.

591
01:08:54,815 --> 01:08:56,790
Thank you.

592
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,265
Du Qiu got away?

593
01:09:13,273 --> 01:09:15,873
What happened?
Get back!

594
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:18,390
I'm still your boss,

595
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:22,265
it's your duty to report to me!

596
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:27,456
I report to Inspector Yamura.

597
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:30,457
I don't take orders from you.

598
01:09:30,481 --> 01:09:34,573
Yamura purposely let the suspect go.

599
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:38,148
I'm in charge of this case!

600
01:09:38,315 --> 01:09:41,290
You still won't admit your mistake?

601
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:44,690
The drugs you're on gave you away.

602
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:49,173
Soon
you're no longer an Inspector.

603
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:51,223
Stupid bitch!

604
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:54,256
What do you mean?

605
01:09:56,273 --> 01:09:58,681
You want to kill me now?

606
01:09:59,148 --> 01:10:03,565
First Division will be here soon
to arrest you.

607
01:10:06,065 --> 01:10:09,190
All because of that bitch!

608
01:10:17,065 --> 01:10:20,331
You've always wanted to stop the leak.

609
01:10:20,523 --> 01:10:24,431
This is Du Qiu's notebook.
Also...

610
01:10:26,106 --> 01:10:28,406
I have this.

611
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:33,040
Hello? Come here at once.
I killed Kiko.

612
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:35,965
Where are you?
In Du Qiu's apartment.

613
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,873
Don't touch anything.
Let me handle this.

614
01:10:55,315 --> 01:10:58,690
Father, don't listen to that asshole.

615
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:06,223
Yamura is onto me.

616
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:09,856
I must go abroad.

617
01:11:10,148 --> 01:11:14,231
Why didn't you kill
Du Qiu there and then?

618
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:21,256
If Du Qiu was dead,
none of this would have happened.

619
01:11:23,398 --> 01:11:26,373
Are you blaming me?

620
01:11:28,856 --> 01:11:30,848
Just think...

621
01:11:31,565 --> 01:11:35,298
I did what I did to protect
your son as well as

622
01:11:35,398 --> 01:11:38,291
the reputation of the new President.

623
01:11:38,315 --> 01:11:39,515
Also,

624
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:42,331
I have no way out.

625
01:11:43,315 --> 01:11:44,865
Tell me...

626
01:11:45,065 --> 01:11:48,240
how much will you give me?

627
01:11:54,273 --> 01:11:57,415
Bitten by my own dog!

628
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:08,656
Look me in the eyes.

629
01:12:08,815 --> 01:12:11,648
Do I look blind to you?

630
01:12:13,148 --> 01:12:14,898
Get a grip!

631
01:12:15,606 --> 01:12:20,540
You're the next President
of Tenjin Pharmaceutical.

632
01:12:20,773 --> 01:12:21,973
Yes.

633
01:12:31,148 --> 01:12:34,273
I found something Masaki left behind.

634
01:12:34,606 --> 01:12:37,165
I don't remember seeing them before.

635
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:41,856
Come, help me take a look.
There's something else I don't get.

636
01:12:43,106 --> 01:12:45,390
What kind of drug would prompt

637
01:12:45,565 --> 01:12:50,823
a private fund to spend such a fortune
on a pharmaceutical company?

638
01:12:50,981 --> 01:12:52,506
"Aether"

639
01:12:52,856 --> 01:12:56,082
What?
A private fund from Bermuda.

640
01:12:56,106 --> 01:12:59,265
They have been funding the research.

641
01:12:59,398 --> 01:13:02,731
Sakai kept me out of this project.

642
01:13:02,898 --> 01:13:04,623
This is what...

643
01:13:05,065 --> 01:13:07,306
they kept from me.

644
01:13:14,856 --> 01:13:17,073
Masaki took this.

645
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:20,131
This. What does it mean?

646
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,957
It's the encryption
of a drug formula at Tenjin.

647
01:13:23,981 --> 01:13:28,040
To ensure confidentiality,
Tenjin has its own encryption.

648
01:13:28,148 --> 01:13:31,981
This should be the new drug
Masaki was working on.

649
01:13:35,856 --> 01:13:39,906
Kitagawa-San, do you have it?
Give me the encryption.

650
01:13:40,106 --> 01:13:41,923
Not yet.

651
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:45,381
This encryption is crucial to us!

652
01:13:46,023 --> 01:13:49,798
It was something Sakai wanted badly.

653
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:54,315
They're testing the drug on humans.

654
01:14:01,523 --> 01:14:04,606
Mayumi,
when you see this letter,

655
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,456
I should be dead.

656
01:14:07,648 --> 01:14:12,740
To make you happy,
I accepted Sakai's money.

657
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:17,448
I'm no longer the nice guy
you thought I was.

658
01:14:17,648 --> 01:14:22,406
But my conscience told me
I couldn't give the formula to Sakai.

659
01:14:22,565 --> 01:14:28,423
I hid the formula here.
I hope that someday it can be used

660
01:14:28,523 --> 01:14:31,356
for the benefit of mankind.

661
01:15:18,856 --> 01:15:20,223
Rain...

662
01:15:20,356 --> 01:15:23,348
I'm sorry about Dawn.

663
01:15:23,856 --> 01:15:27,848
You two girls are like my own blood.

664
01:15:29,273 --> 01:15:32,940
You can't imagine how sad I am.

665
01:15:35,648 --> 01:15:38,698
Don't let her die for nothing.

666
01:15:39,398 --> 01:15:43,848
You know what you need to do.
Don't let me down.

667
01:15:46,148 --> 01:15:48,456
Yes, Father.

668
01:15:59,023 --> 01:16:00,823
Good morning.

669
01:16:01,231 --> 01:16:03,306
What happened?

670
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,582
Why are you crying?

671
01:16:05,606 --> 01:16:09,640
I'm just happy
you have recovered.

672
01:16:10,106 --> 01:16:12,106
Then you should smile.

673
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:15,640
Didn't you tell me not to smile?

674
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,948
I take that back.

675
01:16:21,648 --> 01:16:24,840
You can smile all you want.

676
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:30,541
It's only that...

677
01:16:30,565 --> 01:16:32,581
your smile...

678
01:16:34,898 --> 01:16:37,515
reminds me of her.

679
01:16:38,731 --> 01:16:41,756
Let's not talk about that.

680
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:45,015
Anything to report?

681
01:16:46,023 --> 01:16:50,124
The ingredients of the drugs
found at the scene

682
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:55,298
are identical to those Asano is taking.
The analysis shows it's a strong stimulant.

683
01:16:57,106 --> 01:16:59,298
What a mess!

684
01:16:59,731 --> 01:17:01,598
Don't get up!

685
01:17:03,273 --> 01:17:04,765
Excuse me.

686
01:17:07,398 --> 01:17:08,840
Yamura!

687
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:13,848
Yes.
For the time being you're off the case.

688
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:16,456
Wait!

689
01:17:18,106 --> 01:17:22,823
I'm this close to finding the evidence
to put away Tenjin for good.

690
01:17:22,981 --> 01:17:24,673
This time,

691
01:17:25,231 --> 01:17:27,373
I can definitely close the case.

692
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:31,898
You let the suspect get away.
Three times in a row.

693
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:33,442
Du Qiu

694
01:17:33,543 --> 01:17:36,048
is not the killer.

695
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,840
I urge you to investigate Asano.

696
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:43,940
Asano has disappeared.

697
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:48,315
Disappeared?

698
01:17:49,106 --> 01:17:51,490
President Sakai...

699
01:17:51,731 --> 01:17:56,731
asked a government official
to interfere with the investigation.

700
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:07,223
What kind of justice is that?

701
01:18:15,523 --> 01:18:19,248
"Drunk driver hit a policeman's wife."

702
01:18:19,481 --> 01:18:22,398
You still couldn't let it go?

703
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:25,123
Put yourself in my place.

704
01:18:25,273 --> 01:18:30,365
What would you do if there's
a suicidal cop working for you?

705
01:18:32,773 --> 01:18:35,531
It's time you get on with your life.

706
01:18:35,648 --> 01:18:37,665
She definitely...

707
01:18:38,565 --> 01:18:41,373
would want you to do that.

708
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:49,166
For the past 3 years, I've watched
the research lab from the outside.

709
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:55,856
I often saw a black van hauling a truckload
of people into the research lab.

710
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:59,223
But when it came out,
it was always empty.

711
01:18:59,356 --> 01:19:02,615
Thank you for your help,
Sakaguchbsan.

712
01:19:03,315 --> 01:19:08,840
Don't mention it. You came to me
because you think highly of me.

713
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:13,723
Actually, I want to look in on my pals too.

714
01:19:17,898 --> 01:19:20,906
The homeless are here for the experiment.

715
01:19:21,481 --> 01:19:23,832
Hyakuta-San, this is Mayumi.

716
01:19:23,856 --> 01:19:29,898
Du Qiu went to the Tenjin research lab.
I haven't heard from him.

717
01:19:31,148 --> 01:19:36,056
If you find yourself in any danger,
you must try to get out.

718
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:39,715
Last night, we found
some files Masaki left behind.

719
01:19:39,815 --> 01:19:43,182
We found the encryption of the formula
Tenjin has been looking for.

720
01:19:43,206 --> 01:19:48,448
Du Qiu said
we should tell Yamura about this secret.

721
01:19:48,648 --> 01:19:50,231
The encryption is...

722
01:19:50,331 --> 01:19:56,873
C 11 H 15 N Z n 2.

723
01:19:57,106 --> 01:20:00,090
Got it. Inspector Yamura
is with the doctor right now.

724
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:03,615
Don't worry I'll tell him later.

725
01:20:12,731 --> 01:20:13,856
Mayumbsan'?

726
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:19,998
If this formula is needed
to produce the illegal drug...

727
01:20:24,481 --> 01:20:29,773
this is the evidence that will bring down
Tenjin Pharmaceutical.

728
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:32,248
Open the door!

729
01:20:58,523 --> 01:21:00,381
Kobayashi!
Hatamoto!

730
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:04,381
What happened to you?
We're supposed to test a flu remedy.

731
01:21:04,481 --> 01:21:06,540
Are you Al right?

732
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:12,840
Hideo Sakaguchi, follow me.

733
01:21:16,815 --> 01:21:20,231
Sakaguchbsan!

734
01:21:22,856 --> 01:21:26,756
Inspector, the doctor said
you needed rest. You can't leave!

735
01:21:26,856 --> 01:21:33,298
When Du Qiu told me the secret
about Tenjin, he's prepared to die.

736
01:21:33,398 --> 01:21:35,723
I'll go with you!

737
01:21:35,898 --> 01:21:37,890
Don't.

738
01:21:38,856 --> 01:21:41,198
I have been suspended.

739
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:43,148
Besides...

740
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:45,831
this is personal.

741
01:22:01,606 --> 01:22:03,506
Sakaguchbsan!

742
01:22:07,481 --> 01:22:09,523
He looks so different.

743
01:22:09,648 --> 01:22:11,798
What's going on?
Are you Al right?

744
01:22:11,898 --> 01:22:14,465
The security guards are armed.

745
01:22:14,565 --> 01:22:17,131
They're not hiring handymen?

746
01:22:17,356 --> 01:22:19,465
Something is fishy.
We should go!

747
01:22:19,565 --> 01:22:21,156
Sakaguchbsan!

748
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,556
Please!

749
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:07,248
Don't come near me.

750
01:23:25,648 --> 01:23:27,506
Kill me!

751
01:23:29,731 --> 01:23:31,623
Kill me!

752
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:35,473
Actually, I'm also a fugitive.

753
01:23:35,648 --> 01:23:39,090
I've been on the run from home

754
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,606
for 20 years.

755
01:23:44,398 --> 01:23:46,540
My wife

756
01:23:46,815 --> 01:23:49,590
is a perfect woman.

757
01:23:57,398 --> 01:23:59,640
Do you regret

758
01:24:00,231 --> 01:24:03,323
leaving someone you love?

759
01:24:08,148 --> 01:24:11,665
The only thing
I can do for her now

760
01:24:11,856 --> 01:24:15,165
is not to interfere with her life.

761
01:24:41,565 --> 01:24:43,481
Very impressive,

762
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:46,298
but perhaps a bit excessive?

763
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,923
We need our fighters to
be under our control.

764
01:24:49,023 --> 01:24:55,124
We have been experimenting
for a year now. You see these results.

765
01:24:55,148 --> 01:25:01,415
We have something new.
An updated formula, exactly what you need.

766
01:25:02,606 --> 01:25:07,140
It gives super human strength but
with total thought control.

767
01:25:07,356 --> 01:25:09,806
Now all we need is a war!

768
01:25:09,906 --> 01:25:15,681
Then, both militaries and terrorists
alike will become our happy customers!

769
01:25:27,565 --> 01:25:31,381
Mr. President, if we mix it
with Kitagawa's anesthetic,

770
01:25:31,481 --> 01:25:34,823
its effect can be pushed to the limit.

771
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:43,916
Why is Du Qiu here?
He got in with the homeless.

772
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:46,606
Don't let him get out alive.

773
01:25:50,023 --> 01:25:53,648
Mr. Du,
it's been a long time.

774
01:25:54,106 --> 01:25:57,098
What did you do to Sakaguchi?

775
01:25:57,273 --> 01:26:00,956
He volunteered for some basic tests.

776
01:26:08,856 --> 01:26:10,374
This...

777
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:14,206
will be Tenjin's greatest contribution
to the world.

778
01:26:14,356 --> 01:26:18,365
A super drug,
designed for the battlefield.

779
01:26:18,565 --> 01:26:21,223
You're murderers!

780
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:32,565
Injecting this drug can instantly enhance one's
strength, making one immune to pain and fear.

781
01:26:32,815 --> 01:26:37,398
One's combat ability
can be pushed to the limit.

782
01:26:37,981 --> 01:26:40,490
Mayumbsan

783
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:44,423
it's a shame Kitagawa is no longer with us.

784
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:49,523
The formula he invented three years ago

785
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:54,390
will make up for the inadequacies
of our new drug.

786
01:26:55,023 --> 01:26:58,198
It was his dream too.

787
01:26:58,523 --> 01:27:01,948
Do you know where it is?

788
01:27:03,148 --> 01:27:05,448
I won't tell you...

789
01:27:06,106 --> 01:27:12,465
Masaki invented an anesthetic
to relieve a patient's pain,

790
01:27:12,565 --> 01:27:16,916
the anesthetic is not for you
to kill someone with.

791
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:21,398
This research
is to test pain tolerance.

792
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:28,523
If she won't speak now,
make sure she never speaks again.

793
01:27:29,606 --> 01:27:30,890
Yes.

794
01:27:34,481 --> 01:27:36,865
He's unarmed.

795
01:27:38,565 --> 01:27:41,965
I'm never any good
at dealing with cops.

796
01:27:42,065 --> 01:27:43,715
Really?

797
01:27:44,731 --> 01:27:47,315
What brings you here?

798
01:27:47,481 --> 01:27:49,573
It's none of your business.

799
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:51,698
Cut the crap.

800
01:27:52,356 --> 01:27:57,340
Who do you think you're talking to?
Mind your manners.

801
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:00,315
Pardon us.

802
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,706
We have an honored guest.

803
01:28:02,815 --> 01:28:07,207
I'm Yamura from the First Division
of the Osaka Prefecture Police.

804
01:28:07,231 --> 01:28:09,273
First Division?

805
01:28:10,815 --> 01:28:13,965
You should have been suspended.

806
01:28:18,565 --> 01:28:24,248
I know more about the police inside
than you. I'm closer to you than you think.

807
01:28:24,356 --> 01:28:28,124
I'm looking for a fugitive.
You think I'm harboring a fugitive?

808
01:28:28,148 --> 01:28:30,948
His name is Du Qiu.

809
01:28:31,815 --> 01:28:37,373
Now I remember he's still here.
Maybe he was on the run too long.

810
01:28:37,773 --> 01:28:43,365
He seemed a bit crazy. He trashed up the
place when he arrived. We had him subdued.

811
01:28:44,523 --> 01:28:49,056
I must take him away.
You have a warrant?

812
01:28:49,356 --> 01:28:52,290
Have you forgotten you're off the case?

813
01:28:52,398 --> 01:28:55,506
I'll swap him with some intelligence.
Like what?

814
01:28:55,606 --> 01:28:58,148
C 11...

815
01:28:58,398 --> 01:29:01,098
H 1...

816
01:29:03,065 --> 01:29:07,465
Father! That's the encryption
of Kitagawa's formula.

817
01:29:07,606 --> 01:29:09,190
Hold on.

818
01:29:09,773 --> 01:29:12,215
You'll have the rest

819
01:29:12,356 --> 01:29:14,973
when I see Du Qiu.

820
01:29:17,773 --> 01:29:19,640
Very well.

821
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:22,623
I'll take you to him.

822
01:30:00,523 --> 01:30:04,381
What do you feel,
when you lose someone important?

823
01:30:04,481 --> 01:30:06,015
A pain.

824
01:30:07,315 --> 01:30:10,981
And you will suffer it a very long time.

825
01:30:11,481 --> 01:30:14,031
Why do you ask?

826
01:30:15,898 --> 01:30:19,506
Because I think I know the pain.

827
01:30:59,606 --> 01:31:02,294
This drug is so good.

828
01:31:02,395 --> 01:31:05,706
Even a lawyer can become a beast.

829
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:23,248
I'm not your enemy!

830
01:31:33,856 --> 01:31:37,781
We have to stop them.
Remember?

831
01:31:37,981 --> 01:31:39,840
Sober up!

832
01:31:45,023 --> 01:31:47,765
Don't let this drug beat you.

833
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,356
You're stronger!

834
01:31:51,815 --> 01:31:53,715
The world is full of low life's

835
01:31:53,815 --> 01:31:56,365
I'm sure that I am...

836
01:31:56,565 --> 01:31:58,581
You must hold on.

837
01:31:58,690 --> 01:32:01,207
Stopping the progress of mankind...

838
01:32:01,231 --> 01:32:05,023
I'm trying, but it's really hard.

839
01:32:05,523 --> 01:32:08,207
Let them make their contribution.

840
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:11,031
It's time to fight back.

841
01:32:42,815 --> 01:32:45,623
Kill him.
Yes...

842
01:32:45,731 --> 01:32:47,381
Father.

843
01:33:09,231 --> 01:33:11,457
What are you doing?

844
01:33:11,481 --> 01:33:15,506
Have you forgotten who rescued you
from the orphanage?

845
01:33:15,606 --> 01:33:17,798
To be your lab rat?

846
01:33:17,898 --> 01:33:20,124
Have you lost your mind?

847
01:33:20,148 --> 01:33:21,490
No

848
01:33:21,773 --> 01:33:24,331
I just got it back!

849
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:55,506
Damn! Damn it!

850
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:06,415
Just my luck.
Together again.

851
01:34:06,523 --> 01:34:08,499
I guess it's our fate.

852
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:09,906
What?

853
01:34:10,065 --> 01:34:13,398
But my luck is always bad.

854
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:16,631
It rubs off on everyone.

855
01:34:16,815 --> 01:34:19,631
Then I'm lucky I'm alive.

856
01:34:24,606 --> 01:34:26,173
Hiroshi!

857
01:34:34,856 --> 01:34:36,390
Father.

858
01:34:36,773 --> 01:34:42,290
Allow me to demonstrate
the power of our new drug.

859
01:34:44,398 --> 01:34:48,840
I want to prove
we're doing the right thing.

860
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:53,406
Enough, Hiroshi!
We should leave.

861
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:10,381
Destroy all new drugs and funds.
We must save Tenjin.

862
01:35:10,481 --> 01:35:11,823
Yes!

863
01:36:39,356 --> 01:36:41,481
Open the door!

864
01:36:57,606 --> 01:36:59,573
Hurry! Go!

865
01:37:01,731 --> 01:37:04,765
Get up!
This way!

866
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:56,456
Look at you!
You call yourself a cop?

867
01:37:56,606 --> 01:37:59,598
You useless piece of trash.

868
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:04,815
Wait! Watch out!

869
01:38:06,731 --> 01:38:08,506
Are you Al right?

870
01:38:08,648 --> 01:38:09,956
Run...

871
01:38:10,065 --> 01:38:11,715
Hurry.

872
01:38:12,398 --> 01:38:14,290
Mayumi-San!

873
01:38:14,481 --> 01:38:15,931
Mayumi-San!

874
01:38:39,856 --> 01:38:42,173
Why are you here?

875
01:38:42,273 --> 01:38:43,715
The president sent me.

876
01:38:43,815 --> 01:38:47,090
You'll follow the old man's order
and sleep with anyone?

877
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:49,931
I need the drug.

878
01:38:50,106 --> 01:38:55,465
You want this?
I can give it to you! Say it!

879
01:39:01,981 --> 01:39:03,856
Mayumi-San!

880
01:39:21,898 --> 01:39:24,448
Whatever the old man has...

881
01:39:25,815 --> 01:39:27,881
will be mine!

882
01:39:27,898 --> 01:39:30,065
Let her go!

883
01:39:30,273 --> 01:39:33,582
Let go of her!
Go ahead and shoot!

884
01:39:33,606 --> 01:39:37,323
You're worse than a dog!

885
01:39:38,023 --> 01:39:39,873
Shoot!

886
01:39:48,981 --> 01:39:51,331
Why Du Qiu?

887
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:55,990
It was his own rotten luck...

888
01:40:02,481 --> 01:40:06,365
he showed up at the wrong time.

889
01:40:07,023 --> 01:40:10,181
That's the reason?

890
01:40:31,773 --> 01:40:33,381
Hiroshi!

891
01:40:55,023 --> 01:40:57,031
Stay strong.

892
01:40:58,356 --> 01:41:00,848
Old movies...

893
01:41:01,981 --> 01:41:04,998
always end this way.

894
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:08,748
Don't they?

895
01:41:21,398 --> 01:41:26,916
Du Qiu, I knew you'd
become a threat someday.

896
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:29,748
I should have killed you sooner.

897
01:41:29,898 --> 01:41:31,773
Drop it!

898
01:41:37,106 --> 01:41:39,673
I must go to my son.

899
01:41:43,648 --> 01:41:46,673
This drug...

900
01:41:48,231 --> 01:41:53,323
could have made mankind stronger.
I don't regret any of this.

901
01:41:57,898 --> 01:41:59,515
Goodbye!

902
01:42:23,356 --> 01:42:25,390
Inspector Yamura!

903
01:42:26,898 --> 01:42:28,981
Are you Al right?

904
01:42:29,106 --> 01:42:31,148
Can't you see?

905
01:42:32,023 --> 01:42:33,506
Well?

906
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:35,540
Can you get up?

907
01:42:35,648 --> 01:42:38,148
Chief Ito left this.

908
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:43,781
Are you Al right?

909
01:42:43,898 --> 01:42:46,590
He's seriously injured!

910
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:51,015
It's not that easy to kill me.

911
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:57,548
From now on,

912
01:42:57,773 --> 01:43:00,465
we'll be very busy.

913
01:43:03,773 --> 01:43:05,198
Yes.

914
01:43:09,815 --> 01:43:14,598
I was in the hospital for so long
I almost forgot how blue the sky is.

915
01:43:14,773 --> 01:43:19,590
Everyone can enjoy the blue sky.
The world is fair.

916
01:43:19,731 --> 01:43:25,065
Can't believe they're so close now.
Not long ago they were enemies.

917
01:43:25,273 --> 01:43:26,874
Men...

918
01:43:26,898 --> 01:43:29,823
are simple beings.

919
01:43:30,148 --> 01:43:35,298
Exactly! Do they even
understand each other?

920
01:43:37,231 --> 01:43:43,856
After what happened, at least
I know you're a man of integrity.

921
01:43:45,565 --> 01:43:51,423
Now that I'm leaving, I realize
everything here is very precious.

922
01:43:54,231 --> 01:43:56,806
It's almost time.

923
01:43:58,023 --> 01:44:00,948
For a better tomorrow.

924
01:44:02,148 --> 01:44:04,506
Come to think of it...

925
01:44:04,648 --> 01:44:08,223
we have not been properly introduced.

926
01:44:08,648 --> 01:44:10,548
Satoshi Yamura.

927
01:44:11,148 --> 01:44:13,631
Nice to meet you.

928
01:44:14,273 --> 01:44:17,806
I'm Du Qiu!
Nice to meet you.

929
01:44:23,148 --> 01:44:28,856
Funny! This hand feels
like something is missing.

930
01:44:31,315 --> 01:44:33,348
We should go.

931
01:44:53,773 --> 01:44:55,348
Inspector.
Mmm?

932
01:44:55,356 --> 01:44:58,381
It's becoming popular
to get married on an old train.

933
01:44:58,481 --> 01:44:59,581
Mmm.

934
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:01,090
Don't you think it's so romantic?

935
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:02,398
No.

936
01:45:02,498 --> 01:45:07,598
