2
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,232
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner. "</i>

3
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:47,003
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

4
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,380
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase.</i>

5
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,586
<i>Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses,
they'll know.</i>

6
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:02,262
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

7
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,999
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,558
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

9
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,661
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There it is!</i>

10
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,138
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner. "</i>

11
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,742
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

12
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:22,005
<i>I had heard it at least 14 times that night.</i>

13
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,241
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

14
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,420
<i>First of all, what I
was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

15
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,752
<i>There were certain institutions and people
that frowned upon it,</i>

16
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,020
<i>but it's legal.</i>

17
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,891
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

18
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,157
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

19
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,297
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

20
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:43,429
<i>That's what got me into all this mess.</i>

21
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:49,032
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over $640,000.</i>

22
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,903
<i>All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.</i>

23
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,744
<i>- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.</i>

24
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,819
<i>Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.</i>

25
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,910
<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

26
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,182
<i>Folded arms, the table's hot.</i>

27
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,750
<i>A touch to the eye, we need to talk.</i>

28
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:12,625
<i>And a hand running through
perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.</i>

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,961
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

30
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,305
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner. "</i>

31
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:41,421
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

32
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,233
Premed.

33
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,765
4.0 GPA.

34
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,934
44 MCATs.

35
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,836
President, American Legion Math League.

36
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,313
TA to Professors Wilkins and Sanders.

37
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,682
Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.

38
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,813
And you're accepted early into school here
at Harvard Med,

39
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,858
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

40
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,926
Thank you.

41
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:30,258
The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.

42
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,800
It's a free ride.
And free rides don't come easy.

43
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:34,890
Absolutely.

44
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:40,099
We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship

45
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,802
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.

46
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:45,905
Right.

47
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,675
Professor Phillips?

48
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,885
Some kids grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

49
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,945
You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.

50
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:02,451
I grew up... Well, really,
I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.

51
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:09,161
And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.

52
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,328
Which I don't really have.

53
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,337
So, what I'm trying to say

54
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:22,779
is that I really,
really need this scholarship.

55
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,215
Did you rehearse that?

56
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:30,688
Yeah. Like, 14 times in front of the mirror.

57
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:35,726
Unfortunately,
desire doesn't figure into this much.

58
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,965
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who

59
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,731
dazzles.

60
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:48,364
Somebody who just jumps off the page.

61
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,278
Oh, well, then, I'm also involved
in a science competition.

62
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,109
We're building a robotic wheel

63
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:59,413
that can navigate itself
using a proprietary GPS system.

64
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,621
Well, I'm designing the system. So...

65
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:04,850
Right.

66
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,793
Ben, last year,
the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,

67
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,865
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.

68
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,063
Well, I have both my legs.

69
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,298
Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?

70
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,165
That was a joke.

71
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,077
Ben, it's all about the essay.

72
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,171
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

73
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,615
What life experience separates you
from all the rest.

74
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,211
Life experience.

75
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,018
What can you tell me, Ben,

76
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,752
that's going to dazzle me?

77
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:05,609
I'm so sorry I'm late.

78
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,984
- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.

79
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,650
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

80
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,160
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?

81
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,730
Eight dollars?

82
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:23,100
Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren.
Thank you. Thank you.

83
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,001
You slept with him, didn't you?

84
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,065
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

85
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,805
I'll sleep with him, too,
and I'll get $8 an hour.

86
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:36,041
So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?
And I say to him,

87
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,880
<i>" Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes</i>

88
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,080
<i>" to get the kind of results
that you're looking for," okay?</i>

89
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:46,125
<i>So then he says to me, " Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"</i>

90
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:51,323
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,

91
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,696
<i>" You can never have
enough capacitance probes. "</i>

92
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,602
Oh, my God.
What the hell is wrong with you?

93
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,440
Oh, nothing.

94
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:07,044
I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man.
You should be happy.

95
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:12,278
I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.

96
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,416
And the reason that I have nothing
is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.

97
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,220
- Oh, give me a break, Ben.
- What?

98
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,056
You have everything.

99
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:26,922
You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?

100
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,296
Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.

101
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,666
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.

102
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,703
You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.

103
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,174
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

104
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,178
I even sat up at the
front and I stayed late.

105
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,248
Man, I gave up everything.

106
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,016
You know, I gave up fun. I gave up sex.

107
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,779
I don't think you gave up sex.

108
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,117
- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.

109
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,917
All right, all right. Not sex, but...

110
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,015
It just annoys me that the one thing

111
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,061
that is stopping me
from going to Harvard Med is money.

112
00:09:56,163 --> 00:10:00,395
You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over $300,000.

113
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,293
$300,000.

114
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,702
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high.
I get that.

115
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,709
You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.

116
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,274
Well, look at the bright side,

117
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,945
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

118
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,356
Thank you.

119
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,225
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.

120
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,632
Thank you, love. Kisses.

121
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:37,965
Make a wish.

122
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,368
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

123
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,707
Bravo.

124
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,140
Congratulations, Benjamin.

125
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:47,042
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?

126
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,310
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

127
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,409
Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.

128
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,044
Cam, you owe another six bucks.

129
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,782
No, no. I didn't eat
any of the Buffalo wings.

130
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,358
Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.

131
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,723
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.

132
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,854
I got it, all right? No, no.
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

133
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:08,162
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

134
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,203
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

135
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,671
So, I nailed the specs
on the 2.09 last night,

136
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,141
after 19 cups of coffee.

137
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,270
- Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

138
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,540
This is good. Miles, this is good.

139
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,883
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.

140
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,320
This is called destiny.

141
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,221
You know, there is the... Thank you.

142
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:35,988
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

143
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,497
Oh, yeah?
Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!

144
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,897
Look, guys,

145
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:48,633
we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.

146
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,302
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

147
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,749
If we can't even win that, what's the point?

148
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,254
Hey, hey. Look at this!

149
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,449
No, no, no, no.

150
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,757
We suck.

151
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,368
Your father would be so proud of you, Ben.

152
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,167
Yeah.

153
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,546
Do you remember anything about him?

154
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:32,315
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?

155
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,552
Yeah, I think I watched him shave.

156
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,554
So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?

157
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,391
I don't know. I'll probably just go back
and work on that essay.

158
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,466
Ben, you're working too hard.

159
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:51,265
Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just yourself.

160
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:55,171
You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.

161
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,302
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

162
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,642
Okay. All right.

163
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,610
- Good night.
- All right, good night.

164
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,585
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

165
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,653
All right.

166
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,356
Now, who can explain Newton's method
and how you use it?

167
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,358
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.

168
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,695
That's impressive. That's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,

169
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,299
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

170
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:35,637
All right, now somebody tell me something
I don't already know.

171
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:36,875
Anyone?

172
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,543
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.

173
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,779
Newton stole it.

174
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,882
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

175
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,161
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

176
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,199
And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then it fails.

177
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,097
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.

178
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,230
Ben.

179
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,173
So Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

180
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,971
was the original author of this method.

181
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,171
Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?

182
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,511
Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.

183
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,982
And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson

184
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:18,649
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

185
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,955
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?

186
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:26,465
We're gonna call this
the game show host problem, all right?

187
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,591
Ben, suppose you're on a game show.

188
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:32,194
And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?

189
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:37,208
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.

190
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,710
Which door would you choose, Ben?

191
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,170
Door number one?

192
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,078
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

193
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,174
All right, now, the game show host,

194
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,254
who, by the way,
knows what's behind all the other doors,

195
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:52,553
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

196
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,560
Behind which sits a goat. Now...

197
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,460
Ben, game show host comes up to you.

198
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,965
<i>He says, " Ben, do you want to stay
with door number one</i>

199
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,398
<i>" or go with door number two?"</i>

200
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,960
Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?

201
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,164
- Yeah.
- Well, wait.

202
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,368
Remember, the host knows where the car is

203
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,911
so how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

204
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,880
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

205
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:20,214
Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.

206
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,288
Based on variable change.

207
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,822
Variable change?
But he just asked you a simple question.

208
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,189
Yeah, which changed everything.

209
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,826
Enlighten us.

210
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,194
Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,

211
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,758
I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right.

212
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,967
But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,

213
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:45,272
it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch.

214
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:51,078
So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3%.

215
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,813
Exactly.

216
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,115
People, remember,

217
00:15:56,222 --> 00:16:00,454
if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.

218
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,653
Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch

219
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,254
out of paranoia, fear, emotions.

220
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,267
But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside

221
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:16,199
and let simple math get his ass
into a brand-new car!

222
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,571
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

223
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,737
All right, everybody.

224
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,246
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

225
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,907
Your graded papers are down here
at the end.

226
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,542
You can pick them up on your way out.

227
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,624
I am invincible.

228
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:48,063
Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock.

229
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,687
Man. That's brutal.

230
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,793
You know,
you should just ask her out, man.

231
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,387
It's not like she's a rocket scientist
or anything.

232
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,091
Oh, wait, she is.

233
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,259
Well, why don't you ask her?

234
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:20,031
Because I'm already dating someone.

235
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,931
Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles.

236
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,341
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

237
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:32,040
Hey, you know what?
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.

238
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,550
Yeah, that's funny.

239
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,488
You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?

240
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,194
Well, I'd say getting down with that
would definitely qualify.

241
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,193
Cam!

242
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,887
Boy genius.

243
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,815
You have to follow me now.

244
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,887
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

245
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,090
Come on.

246
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,471
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

247
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,352
Our honored guest.

248
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,157
- How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.

249
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,027
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.

250
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,131
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.

251
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,727
- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.

252
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,902
- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.

253
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,911
Is there a problem with my paper?

254
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:11,211
Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton

255
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,946
and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.

256
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:20,048
Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.

257
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,520
So, is this some kind of a math club?

258
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,460
Don't be rude, people.

259
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,160
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

260
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,861
- Choi.
- Jill.

261
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,804
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.

262
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,338
No, really?
Well, it's really simple, actually.

263
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,539
You play against the dealer.

264
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,807
You're given two cards.

265
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,182
Face cards are worth 10 points.

266
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,346
The closest to 21 wins.

267
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:53,320
If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.

268
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,662
It's the most popular card game
in the world.

269
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:58,992
It's a game with memory.

270
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,794
Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.

271
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,631
And the best part, it's beatable.

272
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,101
Are you talking about counting cards?

273
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,804
No. I'm talking about
getting very, very rich.

274
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,474
You count cards, right? All of you?

275
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,076
As a team, yes.

276
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,845
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

277
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,455
- Where?
- Vegas, baby.

278
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,256
So, why are you telling me?

279
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,197
Well, let's just say a spot opened up
on our roster.

280
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,326
How?

281
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,028
Jimmy got a job at Google.

282
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:43,575
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.

283
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,506
Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?

284
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,911
Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler.

285
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,011
Yeah... This is crazy.

286
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,814
No, Ben. This is profitable.

287
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,354
Yeah, I can't do it. So, I'm sorry.

288
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,396
- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.

289
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,055
No, it's not that. It's...

290
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:11,102
I just got a promotion at my job,
so it's kind of not a good time for me.

291
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,671
We pay better.

292
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,101
Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends.

293
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:19,838
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.

294
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,107
I mean, what do you have to worry about?

295
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:26,276
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

296
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:31,915
Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.

297
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,521
You know, the 2.09 Competition?

298
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:38,726
Wait, no.
I'm building a car that drives by itself.

299
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,664
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,

300
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,793
so it's kind of important.

301
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:47,737
Ben, let the car drive by itself.

302
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:55,937
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also composed.

303
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,674
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

304
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,956
Ben, you were born for this.

305
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:08,155
You'll have more fun
than you've ever had in your entire life.

306
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,660
It's perfect.

307
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:15,366
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.

308
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,869
So I'm sorry.

309
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:25,870
Ben.

310
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:29,613
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

311
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,411
- No, of...
- No.

312
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,678
You're one of my favorite new students,

313
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:37,017
and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.

314
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,928
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.

315
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,865
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?

316
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,163
So, how much is this thing gonna run me?

317
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:56,469
Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95,
minus 15%.

318
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,238
The jacket's $589.99.

319
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:02,906
The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both.

320
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:07,281
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99.

321
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,513
The shoes were just marked down
from $155,

322
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:15,185
so you're looking at $1,042.68.

323
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,661
I'm pretty good with numbers.

324
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,995
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

325
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,401
Yeah, so let me know
when I can ring that up for you guys.

326
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,402
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

327
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:34,737
Hey.

328
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:38,541
Hey.

329
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:42,687
- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

330
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,821
I'm looking for a tie.

331
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:50,328
Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale
on the ties.

332
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:55,056
And if you want,
I could probably get you an additional 10%

333
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,193
with my employee discount.

334
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,805
- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

335
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:07,506
This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,

336
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:11,674
you know, to repel liquids and stains.

337
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:16,312
- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.

338
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,957
Face me. Stay still.

339
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:24,360
Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,

340
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:30,025
I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben.

341
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,232
I came to see you.

342
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,735
You did?

343
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,342
Blackjack's a great game.

344
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,073
No, look, it's easy to learn

345
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:45,981
and there's really not as much
strategy to it as people think.

346
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,176
I grew up on it, actually.

347
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:51,723
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:56,057
Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.

349
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,787
I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.

350
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,393
If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream.

351
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,367
And what if he won?

352
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,996
He'd still take me out for ice cream.

353
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:12,441
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, he's your dad.

354
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:17,812
Ben, you should feel the thrill

355
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:22,014
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

356
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,257
I think you should come to Vegas.

357
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:34,766
'Cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

358
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,700
I can't.

359
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:43,907
I'm sorry.

360
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:46,444
I just can't.

361
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,014
Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.

362
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:53,878
Yeah.

363
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:56,519
You're welcome any time.

364
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:04,394
You know,
I think the best thing about Vegas

365
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,565
is you can become anyone you want.

366
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,290
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

367
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,364
- No.
- Plus 11.

368
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,454
No.

369
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,599
<i>- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me " dude. "</i>

370
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,102
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

371
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,367
People, please. We had a total of 76 cards
that came out of the deck.

372
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,601
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

373
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,803
Seventeen were neutral with no value at all,

374
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:54,641
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

375
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:57,375
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

376
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,412
The count. It's plus 13.

377
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:06,983
Yes.

378
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,752
Pull up a chair.

379
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,528
Stop.

380
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,069
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

381
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,142
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

382
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,536
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

383
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,703
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

384
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,780
Cat.

385
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,614
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

386
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,977
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

387
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:38,182
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

388
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,780
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

389
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:43,157
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.

390
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,965
<i>I was studying all day, every day.</i>

391
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:51,526
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

392
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:54,697
<i>used in ways I could never have imagined.</i>

393
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,472
<i>The team had a system.</i>

394
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,245
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

395
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,610
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

396
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,353
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

397
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:09,478
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

398
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,385
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

399
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:12,986
Plus 12.

400
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,185
Is this chemistry review?

401
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,590
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

402
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,826
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

403
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,300
Use it in a sentence.

404
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,667
Man, that sugar's sweet.

405
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,869
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

406
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,501
<i>That's how I knew what to bet.</i>

407
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,307
You're doing great.

408
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:41,381
Micky, I just want to let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,

409
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,512
which is $300,000.

410
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:47,285
I mean, if I can get anything close to that,
then I'm done.

411
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,825
<i>Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not " if," it's " when. "</i>

412
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,592
And second of all,
I get it. I completely understand.

413
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,327
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

414
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:59,700
Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,

415
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:03,172
so who knows how long this gig's
gonna last for any of us?

416
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,004
What if we get caught?

417
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,171
Our system keeps us under the radar,
you'll see.

418
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,942
Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal.

419
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:16,311
- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.

420
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,592
You think you can beat the system?

421
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:27,363
This is the system, beating you back.

422
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:33,264
You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.

423
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,671
- Get him up.
- Come on, kid.

424
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,334
Count to five.

425
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,141
- Count to five!
- What?

426
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,885
Count to five so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.

427
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,112
Start with one.

428
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,814
One, two, three, four, five.

429
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:55,121
Good. Now, stop counting.

430
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,025
Let's go.

431
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,170
<i>You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.</i>

432
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:07,330
<i>My grandmother splits eights.</i>

433
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,999
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.

434
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,736
Look, you're choosing to play two hands

435
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:14,369
against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?

436
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,505
Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.

437
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,674
Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play.

438
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:21,412
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?

439
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,818
Choi, why don't you explain to Ben
how we do?

440
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,288
Oh, all right.

441
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,827
So, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,

442
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,657
spotters and big players, right?

443
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:34,221
So if you think that this table
is the casino floor,

444
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:38,132
then salt and pepper shakers
are your spotters.

445
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:41,035
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

446
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,473
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

447
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:47,569
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

448
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,410
That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.

449
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,576
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,

450
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,246
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

451
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,084
Right. And then when one of the decks
gets hot,

452
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,681
the spotter at that table signals
in the big player.

453
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:03,227
This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.

454
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,388
Well, I'm always the mustard, so...

455
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:09,661
When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,

456
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:13,670
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.

457
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:16,468
So the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

458
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,770
When the deck cools, he cashes in.

459
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,367
It's not as easy as it sounds.

460
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,912
Oh, yeah, it's not, you know,

461
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,642
because if Grey Poupon over here
ever loses the count,

462
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,583
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

463
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,280
- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.

464
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,580
Show us.

465
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,089
Okay, what's this?

466
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,592
- The deck's hot.
- Right.

467
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,559
We need to talk.

468
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,225
The deck's cooling.

469
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,494
And get out. Get out now.

470
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:49,300
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

471
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,272
There's a trial run?

472
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,674
- Where?
- You'll find out.

473
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:47,825
Hey.

474
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,314
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

475
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:08,983
Follow me.

476
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,524
This way.

477
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,166
Go, go. You go.

478
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,152
No more bet. No more bet.

479
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,187
Come on, money.

480
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,094
Today, 14.

481
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,962
Whose side are you on?

482
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,503
Sixteen.

483
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,704
Thank you. Sorry, gentlemen.

484
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,478
So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?

485
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,953
- You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. $300.

486
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,325
$300.

487
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,769
$300.

488
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,512
You bet, sir?

489
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,644
Thanks.

490
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,466
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

491
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:10,540
<i>" Winner, winner, chicken dinner. "
All right.</i>

492
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,874
Nice.

493
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,315
Can I get another drink, please?

494
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,917
Thank you.

495
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,522
What the hell are you doing?

496
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,754
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

497
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,490
Get off, I haven't done anything!

498
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,227
Please. Please let go.

499
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,132
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.

500
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,603
- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!

501
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,264
What's the count?

502
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,368
Plus 18.

503
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,208
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

504
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,478
Congratulations, Ben.

505
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,816
Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.

506
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,685
Welcome to the team.

507
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,386
We didn't mean it.

508
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,428
It's okay, Campbell,
I cried inside that bag.

509
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:16,001
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

510
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,406
I want you to take Jimmy's place.

511
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,943
I've never done this.

512
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,274
I know that and I understand.

513
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:25,509
But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.

514
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,778
Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,

515
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,683
and I've never had a student
as impressive as you.

516
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:32,018
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.

517
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:34,649
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

518
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,593
'Cause you remind me of myself
25 years ago.

519
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,990
You in?

520
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,600
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.

521
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,701
There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.

522
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,307
We're counting cards, we're not gambling.

523
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,640
We're following a specific set of rules
and playing a system.

524
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:58,738
Right.

525
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,875
I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,

526
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,887
and sometimes, people lose control.

527
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,484
They give in to their emotions.

528
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,192
You will not.

529
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,953
You understand?

530
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,122
Yeah.

531
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,034
Get some rest.

532
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,694
- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

533
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:23,434
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy
paper due Tuesday.

534
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,968
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

535
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,943
No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly.

536
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,207
I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,

537
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:32,943
and he understood, so he gave you an A.

538
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:37,644
You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.

539
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,350
You'll get a call about details later.

540
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,528
So did the girls go on ahead, huh?

541
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,962
Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags
to check, you know?

542
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,123
Okay.

543
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:51,134
Well, wait for us by security
'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.

544
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,328
No, I'm good.

545
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,769
No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.

546
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:57,740
- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.

547
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,608
Honestly, I really don't have to go.

548
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:05,114
- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I really don't have to...

549
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:06,275
Please just shut up.

550
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,615
Why are you looking over there?
Look, I don't...

551
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,813
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.

552
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,117
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

553
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,556
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

554
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,291
Don't ask questions.

555
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,127
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

556
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:27,569
You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.

557
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:32,401
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

558
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:34,638
And we're not about
to have them confiscate $250,000.

559
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,475
$250,000?

560
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:40,544
- No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

561
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,848
You really suck at not asking questions.

562
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,889
What's a donkey boy?

563
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,794
- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.

564
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,963
- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.

565
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,699
Act casual, think casual, be casual.

566
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,503
Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.

567
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:05,940
Thank you.

568
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:11,508
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.

569
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,675
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

570
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,969
Your boarding pass.

571
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,019
Sir?

572
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,371
You forgot your bag.

573
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,177
Thanks.

574
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,428
Nice going, Campbell.

575
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,199
Hey, Ben.
Basic strategy says you should hit that.

576
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:37,415
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,

577
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:40,719
Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.

578
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,816
So glad you could make it.

579
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,926
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

580
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,328
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

581
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:48,592
You live in Washington, D.C.

582
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,466
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.

583
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,834
- I don't like my name.
- Why not?

584
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,034
<i>" Sierra Sommers. " Do I look like a Sierra?</i>

585
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:00,338
Well, you have a lot of clever outfits.
You'll figure it out.

586
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:03,608
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

587
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:06,912
You know, I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?

588
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,248
Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.

589
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:12,050
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

590
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:14,421
and it allows everyone to be different
people in different casinos.

591
00:43:14,526 --> 00:43:18,553
Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell.
That's the way it works.

592
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,362
Like I'm not going already.

593
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:21,557
Yeah. All right. Now, listen.

594
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,601
Ben, this is for you.
All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.

595
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:26,068
<i>They're called " eyes in the sky. "</i>

596
00:43:26,171 --> 00:43:29,106
For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,

597
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,698
and at all times, you don't know each other.

598
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:36,110
Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.

599
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:38,441
And what's our motto?

600
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,484
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

601
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,280
Thank you very much.

602
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:44,913
How come you don't play?

603
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:48,220
Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.

604
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:51,227
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.

605
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,921
Welcome to Vegas.

606
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,300
No more bets.

607
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,240
All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.

608
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:09,404
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?

609
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:12,244
Oh, see,
now that sounds really complicated.

610
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,511
- I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

611
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,281
Here to double my family's inheritance.

612
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:20,547
I don't know.

613
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:41,778
$10,000.

614
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,681
Changing $10,000.

615
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,648
Sweet. Too sweet.

616
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:09,932
<i>Eight. The count's still plus 16.</i>

617
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,511
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

618
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,472
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

619
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,475
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

620
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,020
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

621
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:27,651
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

622
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,057
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

623
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:32,386
Can I split those?

624
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:35,489
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.

625
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,232
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

626
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:50,979
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

627
00:45:57,188 --> 00:46:00,055
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

628
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,555
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

629
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,626
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

630
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,468
<i>Blackjack.</i>

631
00:46:59,284 --> 00:47:00,683
Monkey! Monkey!

632
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,685
- So what's a monkey?
- Face card.

633
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:06,188
All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.

634
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:10,887
Monkey!

635
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:12,661
Monkey! Come on, give us a monkey!

636
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:15,927
Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.

637
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:17,524
Monkey! Monkey!

638
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,703
All right, all right.

639
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:28,439
Oh, God.

640
00:47:29,581 --> 00:47:31,105
I need to quit.

641
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:38,080
Could I color up, please?

642
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,364
Nice undies.

643
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,931
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

644
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:32,873
We split it five ways.

645
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,811
So, what do you think?

646
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,544
Yeah, it was fun.

647
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:43,453
- You were good.
- Really?

648
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:46,990
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

649
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:51,050
You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.

650
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:55,355
And you made more money than Fisher.

651
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:58,193
I was pretty nervous, actually.

652
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:02,272
You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of easy.

653
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:05,599
Not for everyone.

654
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,837
Yeah, it's just simple math.

655
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:11,314
Good.
We can do some serious damage with you.

656
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:19,053
Here's the thing I told Micky.

657
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:23,655
You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.

658
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:26,423
You know, $300,000 and then I'm out.

659
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,093
That's what they all say.

660
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:35,498
No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this
to pay for Harvard.

661
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:38,074
It's just a means to an end for me.

662
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:41,411
I believe you.

663
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:42,971
Good.

664
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:56,251
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

665
00:49:58,062 --> 00:49:59,051
Team meeting.

666
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,758
Hello?

667
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:02,127
- Hey.
- Hey.

668
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,967
Where's everybody else?

669
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:06,832
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.

670
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:12,935
Oh, Fisher, you didn't sleep.

671
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:17,771
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

672
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:21,911
She's a dancer.
I pulled her out of Sapphire.

673
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:26,890
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

674
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:29,392
Where's Kianna?

675
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:30,854
Slots.

676
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:36,328
- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.

677
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:39,365
I've been busy this morning.

678
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:44,173
All right, guys, let's get something clear.

679
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:46,505
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

680
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:49,011
This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.

681
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:51,104
Kianna, slots are for losers.

682
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:53,376
Fisher, peelers are stealers.

683
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:54,742
Choi?

684
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:59,216
You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens

685
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:03,123
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

686
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:07,288
But, Fisher,
what the hell were you up to last night?

687
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:08,689
What?

688
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,792
Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,

689
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,097
but you kept on anyway.

690
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,796
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

691
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,840
In either case,
I don't wanna see it happen again.

692
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:18,806
Jill, nice disguise last night.

693
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:23,574
And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.

694
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:25,638
Beginner's luck.

695
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,742
Hey, Fisher.
Win like a man, lose like a man.

696
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,379
Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.

697
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:32,820
You know what's worse than a loser?

698
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:36,155
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

699
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,125
Take it up with Ida.

700
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,558
Who's Ida?

701
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:43,057
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

702
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,158
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

703
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:14,087
There goes that paycheck.

704
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:24,940
- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.

705
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:30,113
How's she doing?

706
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:31,812
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.

707
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:34,817
The way I see it, yesterday's history,
tomorrow's a mystery.

708
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:37,717
It's all what you do in the moment, baby.

709
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,926
Just lost another property.

710
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:56,405
- Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage?
- Caesars.

711
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:00,068
That was a 14-year account.

712
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:04,347
- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.

713
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:09,942
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.

714
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:12,852
Okay, Clark, I'll take a look at the tape.

715
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:16,493
By the way, you wanna lose the cigarette?

716
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:20,954
There's no smoking in here, you know that.

717
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:28,628
I appreciate it.

718
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,281
End of an era, my friend.

719
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:48,355
Ben. Time for school.

720
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,357
I seem to keep waking up to you.

721
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,126
Don't get used to it.

722
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,610
I'm glad you came over this morning.

723
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,725
- I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?

724
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:26,220
I want you to have this.

725
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,193
What's this?

726
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,635
That's a lot of money.

727
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,769
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

728
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:44,211
I know it won't pay the whole way,
but it should help.

729
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:48,383
Ma, I can't take this.

730
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:51,013
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

731
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:55,923
For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay
for med school, Dr. Campbell.

732
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,964
Well, you know what? You don't have to.

733
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:07,504
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.

734
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:10,797
Yep, they're gonna pay the whole way.

735
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:15,142
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.

736
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:17,441
And actually, I just found out today.

737
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:20,711
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

738
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:24,283
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.

739
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:32,290
- I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.

740
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:36,890
So, listen, you keep this, all right?
It's yours.

741
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,634
What are you doing?

742
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:22,611
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.

743
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,714
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

744
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:31,310
- No. Not really, never.
- No.

745
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:33,449
Right.

746
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,887
All right.

747
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:40,429
So where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.

748
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:44,194
Oh, yeah? I ended up
having to go to New Hampshire

749
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:46,701
to help my cousin move.

750
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,738
You didn't bring your cell phone?

751
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,569
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

752
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:56,977
No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here.
So, you know.

753
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,447
Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.

754
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,778
Oh, yeah?

755
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:03,115
We almost had a girl there.

756
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,652
- Republik?
- Yes.

757
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,184
Let's do it!

758
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,094
She is an eight.

759
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:25,875
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

760
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:28,945
Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.

761
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:30,570
That's right.

762
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:35,384
But if we win the 2.09, I'm asking her out.

763
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,460
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only owe eight bucks.

764
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,870
Hey. Can I get you a beer?

765
00:57:57,775 --> 00:58:00,573
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

766
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:07,340
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights?

767
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:08,877
Hey.

768
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:15,589
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

769
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:17,183
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

770
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:19,359
Thank you.

771
00:58:25,536 --> 00:58:27,902
Are those your friends over there?

772
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:35,639
No. No, I've never seen them before
in my life.

773
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:39,810
Could you just excuse me for one second?

774
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,179
Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.

775
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:46,347
Yeah, we know.

776
00:58:46,457 --> 00:58:47,481
Yeah, well, can you not?

777
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:49,354
I think it's gonna freak her out a bit,
don't you think?

778
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,089
Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.

779
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,858
So how do you know her?

780
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:58,457
Did you, like, take some self-help seminar
or something?

781
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,594
What?

782
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:04,666
- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.

783
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:07,934
- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.

784
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,139
There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.

785
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:12,840
It's getting ridiculous.

786
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,511
He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.

787
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,087
- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.

788
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:20,179
They let him, and he does.

789
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,825
He ends up with, like, two 19s and two 20s.

790
00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:26,986
The dealer turns over a 17.

791
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:28,826
It's soft. He needs to take another card.

792
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:31,299
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?

793
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:34,200
- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. My God.

794
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:37,837
Not a great Christmas that year.

795
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:43,835
So, what does he think about what you do?
Does he know?

796
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,576
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.

797
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,950
My dad's gone, too.

798
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:08,201
So, you know, when you came into the store
to ask me to join the team,

799
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:10,700
was that because...

800
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,302
What?

801
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:15,976
Well, you know,
was it because Micky asked you to?

802
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:22,244
Look, we've had three classes together.

803
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:26,222
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

804
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:28,154
that nobody understood.

805
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:33,491
You're the smartest person in every single
one of those classes, Ben.

806
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:37,761
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

807
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,903
No, no, not so much...

808
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:43,872
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.

809
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,408
- It's not a problem.
- I don't know why I just did that.

810
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,738
- Don't apologize.
- Are you sure?

811
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:50,405
Yes. Shit, this is my stop.

812
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:52,914
- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.

813
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:55,713
But, really, don't worry about it.

814
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,583
I don't know,
it's just 'cause we've been drinking, and...

815
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,181
It's just we're on a team, we work together.

816
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,726
- I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

817
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,353
Okay. Sure. Bye.

818
01:01:27,484 --> 01:01:31,215
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

819
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:35,525
<i>I had saved over $100,000.</i>

820
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,752
<i>Only $200,000 to go.</i>

821
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:43,899
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

822
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:56,006
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

823
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:58,377
<i>the concept of vectors and formulas</i>

824
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:01,178
<i>were replaced with counting,
shuffle tracking</i>

825
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:04,448
<i>knowing when to hit
and knowing when to color out.</i>

826
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:07,282
<i>I was becoming a pro on all levels.</i>

827
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:09,555
<i>I made more money in one trip to Vegas</i>

828
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:15,064
<i>than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.</i>

829
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:19,902
<i>In Boston, I was just Ben Campbell.</i>

830
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:24,669
<i>But in Vegas, I could be anyone I wanted.</i>

831
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:27,073
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do?

832
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:30,442
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down
on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!

833
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:33,778
<i>One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir
to a pharmaceutical fortune.</i>

834
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:37,012
Leon, could you make sure
there's some champagne,

835
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:41,084
maybe some strawberries
waiting in there for me.

836
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:42,923
I may not be alone.

837
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:46,655
<i>The next, I'd be the hottest video game
designer on the West Coast.</i>

838
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,663
There it is.

839
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:52,257
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

840
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,501
No, please, keep going.
This video's priceless.

841
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,637
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

842
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:06,840
<i>It did get, well,
a little confusing sometimes.</i>

843
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,376
<i>Operator, how can I help you?</i>

844
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:11,784
Yeah, room service.

845
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:14,323
<i>Excuse me?
Honey, we don't do room service.</i>

846
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:16,085
What do you mean,
you don't do room service?

847
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:18,559
<i>I mean, we don't do room service.</i>

848
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:33,269
<i>In Boston, we had a secret.</i>

849
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:42,143
<i>In Vegas, we had a life.</i>

850

<i>Micky said I was gonna have more fun
than I could possibly imagine.</i>

851
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:57,791
<i>And he was right.</i>

852
01:04:01,772 --> 01:04:03,831
- Hey, Jamie. There you go.
- Nice.

853
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:05,636
<i>It was too good to be true.</i>

854
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:09,769
There you go. All right,
my night just got better. Thank you, Joe.

855
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,714
<i>And it felt like it was never going to end.</i>

856
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:27,188
Clark? I think I got something over here.

857
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:29,593
Take a look at this.

858
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:34,570
That guy? He's a kid.

859
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:38,402
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.

860
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:40,874
Plus, he ordered a tonic and lime.

861
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:43,674
Tonic and lime. What does that mean?

862
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,010
It means he wants you
to think he's drinking.

863
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:49,415
Okay. So is he counting
or is he just getting lucky?

864
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,554
He's not running a progressive system.

865
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:54,852
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.

866
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:57,586
- How can you tell if it's heavy or light?
- I'm counting.

867
01:04:57,694 --> 01:04:58,854
You...

868
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,996
Tell me something, Cole,
if you can count that well,

869
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:05,830
why are you still consulting for us?

870
01:05:05,936 --> 01:05:07,403
I've been asking myself the same thing.

871
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:10,940
Let's just say I like being
on your side of the hustle.

872
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:14,367
Bring up a frame of that for me
on the printer.

873
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:20,372
So, Terry, I heard
you guys are losing a lot of work

874
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:23,510
to that biometric
facial recognition software.

875
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:28,683
Just gives us a little bit more time
to focus on you guys.

876
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:33,958
- That's impressive software.
- They do.

877
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:35,962
Here he is.

878
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:41,362
I still think there're bigger fish
to fry out there.

879
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:42,802
So do I.

880
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:52,273
Hey, Fisher.

881
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:54,441
He's mad at me and jealous of you.

882
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:57,042
But don't worry.
Greatness evokes that reaction sometimes.

883
01:05:57,154 --> 01:06:00,089
- Don't worry about it. I gotta go.
- All right.

884
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,933
- Hey.
- What's going on?

885
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:15,798
He just didn't like the subject
I chose for my final paper.

886
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:17,533
- That's bullshit, Ben.
- What?

887
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,575
I know when you're lying,
I'm your best friend.

888
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:21,701
At least I thought I was.

889
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:24,438
Are you on drugs, Ben?

890
01:06:24,548 --> 01:06:26,482
Because there's a group that meets
at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.

891
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,517
No, no. Cam, I'm not on drugs, okay?

892
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:31,382
I'll go to the meeting if you need me to.

893
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,718
Why didn't you tell me you quit J. Press?

894
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:37,626
I don't know.

895
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:40,325
- Is it Jill Taylor?
- No.

896
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,160
What about Harvard?

897
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,297
It'll find a way of working itself out.

898
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,599
Look, I gotta go. I'll see you.

899
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:07,983
<i>I think the worst part of it
was not being able to tell anyone.</i>

900
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:16,292
<i>But for the first time in my life,
the world made itself easy for me.</i>

901
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:19,060
Here you go, sir.

902
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:20,727
<i>And I liked it.</i>

903
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:22,905
That's for you.

904
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:29,509
We just made $210,000.

905
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:30,671
Yes.

906
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:33,272
Now, Ben, this is how we play!

907
01:07:35,919 --> 01:07:38,353
<i>And play we did.</i>

908
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,685
<i>Nothing cost too much.</i>

909
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:47,320
<i>Nothing was out of reach.</i>

910
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:55,802
<i>I guess you could say
the casino host of fate</i>

911
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:58,500
<i>gave Ben Campbell a major upgrade.</i>

912
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:04,345
<i>Dorm rooms turned into high-roller suites.</i>

913
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:08,541
<i>Bicycles became stretch limos.</i>

914
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:13,622
No, no!

915
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:21,387
<i>And college bars that were always filled
with frat dudes were upgraded to,</i>

916
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:26,134
<i>well, something more interesting.</i>

917
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:23,756
- Hey, baby. Where you in from?
- I'm from Boston.

918
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:28,930
- On a convention?
- No, business, actually.

919
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:33,500
What line of work you in, mister?

920
01:09:34,237 --> 01:09:36,000
I count things.

921
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,766
My name's Sierra.

922
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:45,576
Hi, Sierra. I'm Salvador Sanchez.

923
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:50,348
Would you like a private dance, Salvador?

924
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:55,857
Well, that all depends
on how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.

925
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:00,989
$20 a song, 30-song minimum.

926
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:04,458
Sounds expensive.

927
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,980
- Good evening, Mr. Klein.
- Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.

928
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:30,582
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.

929
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:33,663
You are so lucky you're cute.

930
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:36,459
'Cause if you weren't cute, I'd leave.
You know that?

931
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:40,127
Jeffrey. My brother from another mother.

932
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:41,796
How you doing? You good?

933
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:45,102
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K.
What, are you back in town for business?

934
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:50,339
- It's all business in this town, right?
- Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.

935
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,181
Oh, damn, I forgot my ring.

936
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:55,183
Oh, please.

937
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:05,223
I don't wanna bet that. That's for keep.

938
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:07,257
$100,000 going out.

939
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:11,294
Thank you, Jeffrey.

940
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:20,567
Cole. Your boy's back.

941
01:11:24,581 --> 01:11:26,139
- That's him, right?
- There he is.

942
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:29,275
And he brought
a whole lot more money with him.

943
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:38,986
That is a hell of a suit, by the way.

944
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:58,809
- That is some aftershave he has going on.
- Sir, could you not? Please.

945
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,187
This girl's only betting the table minimum.
Why's she keep looking at him?

946
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:11,989
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see
if she signals him to come to the table.

947
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:16,991
<i>We don't use " tape" anymore, old school.
It's digital now.</i>

948
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:21,563
Never mind. Terry, rewind it.

949
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:25,965
Okay, okay.

950
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,371
She's playing the table minimum.

951
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,639
Now, in a second,
she's gonna do something.

952
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:34,615
She's gonna raise her hand,
scratch her head... There it is.

953
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:38,720
That's the signal. See?
She gave him the signal.

954
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:42,155
He comes to the table.
I'm telling you, they're working together.

955
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:43,316
Nice.

956
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:47,554
Show me a computer that can do that.

957
01:12:52,402 --> 01:12:54,029
You look familiar.

958
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:57,101
I know you, don't I?

959
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,539
- I don't think so.
- No?

960
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:05,343
<i>Oh, sure, you look exactly like that guy
in Rain Man.</i>

961
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:10,517
Oh, yeah? Well, people say
I look like Tom Cruise all the time.

962
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,315
Oh, yeah? No.

963
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:17,086
The other one,
the... What's his... The retard.

964
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:23,327
I just love that scene in Vegas
when the retard wins at blackjack.

965
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:26,201
You look just like that.

966
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:36,945
What I could never understand, though,
is how someone so retarded,

967
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:39,542
could win so much.

968
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:45,410
Hey, Jeffrey,
his brother from another mother,

969
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:47,285
how did that retard win so much?

970
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:50,325
- You know what, sir? I think that maybe...
- Okay, get your hands off me.

971
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,621
Oh, I didn't mean it.

972
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:30,027
His luck'll run out eventually.
It always does.

973
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:42,640
- Hey, Ben...
- No, Ben, stop it!

974
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:44,610
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, come on! Ben!

975
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:48,172
Oh, you think that's funny?
You think that was funny? Shut up!

976
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:49,649
I understand, Ben. We don't need anymore...

977
01:14:49,752 --> 01:14:51,583
This is not the time. Okay?

978
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:54,486
I want to thank you
for confirming my choice in Ben.

979
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,956
Now go home.

980
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:04,323
- What?
- You're off the team.

981
01:15:04,434 --> 01:15:05,492
No.

982
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,869
- I was drunk, I was...
- I don't care what you were.

983
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:12,404
I'm not leaving.

984
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,033
Yes, you are.

985
01:15:15,545 --> 01:15:18,013
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

986
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:25,753
You've been the big man for a long time,
but you just acted like a child.

987
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,983
So I want you to pick up the ticket
and go home,

988
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:33,119
because if you don't,
you know exactly what I'm capable of doing,

989
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,027
don't you?

990
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:53,271
All right, listen up.

991
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:56,910
Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.

992
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,887
That means we got less than 24 hours
to cash in,

993
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:02,253
or we're gonna be sitting
with 200 grand of worthless plastic.

994
01:16:02,358 --> 01:16:04,588
- So we'll cash out.
- It's too hot.

995
01:16:04,694 --> 01:16:08,596
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in
the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.

996
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:10,893
So let's do it right now
before they can do that.

997
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,968
Are you deliberately slow?

998
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,361
What about them?

999
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,297
What about them?

1000
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:22,708
They can cash in the chips.
The casino's just gonna think they're tips.

1001
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:31,586
- Cashing out.
- Thank you.

1002
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:33,781
- Thank you.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1003
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,824
- Thanks, hon.
- Thank you, baby.

1004
01:16:41,497 --> 01:16:43,556
I love a parade, don't you?

1005
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:48,500
You know, there's a word
I don't throw around all that often,

1006
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,333
<i>" Genius. "</i>

1007
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:21,861
Hey, Kianna.
Let me hold your bag for a second.

1008
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:23,834
Thanks, baby, here.

1009
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,430
Oh, no problem. Anytime.

1010
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:28,442
- Watch. Watch, watch. Ready?
- Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.

1011
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:29,533
Watch.

1012
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:33,376
No, it's great, you just need
to get your knee a little higher.

1013
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:57,062
- Hi.
- Hey.

1014
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:00,875
So the Hard Rock comped me a suite.

1015
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:04,079
That's cool, that's great.

1016
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,845
You wanna see it?

1017
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:13,876
All right, take care, Bobby. All right?

1018
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:35,894
God, it's cold.

1019
01:19:36,339 --> 01:19:38,239
Hey, what time is it?

1020
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:42,371
He's only 45 minutes late.
Show a little patience.

1021
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,838
Oh, look. Here he comes.

1022
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:48,640
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

1023
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:49,979
Hey, Ben.

1024
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:52,050
You know, you could try
returning a call once in a while.

1025
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:54,316
Good of you to show up, man.
It's not like we're cold or anything.

1026
01:19:54,423 --> 01:19:55,788
Yeah, funny.

1027
01:19:57,093 --> 01:20:00,722
- Hey, did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it. There it is.

1028
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:03,765
And you're sure
you didn't inlay the software on more space

1029
01:20:03,866 --> 01:20:05,060
than the parameters suggest?

1030
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:07,193
No. It's just one-fifth of the free face.

1031
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,294
Let's fire this mother up.

1032
01:20:09,405 --> 01:20:10,667
Beautiful.

1033
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:20,743
Okay.

1034
01:20:21,284 --> 01:20:22,376
Okay.

1035
01:20:25,888 --> 01:20:27,480
What's happening?

1036
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,351
- I don't understand.
- It's the wrong size.

1037
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:34,724
No. What?

1038
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:39,097
- What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K.
- Right.

1039
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,670
Yeah, we needed 16K!

1040
01:20:44,106 --> 01:20:47,906
- I can't believe this.
- I thought it was an 8K.

1041
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,602
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

1042
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:53,944
No, you didn't. You knew the entire time
the discrete was 16K.

1043
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,712
Damn it, Ben.

1044
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:59,083
It's gonna take us two weeks
to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.

1045
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:02,589
And another five days, minimum,
to get it ready to press.

1046
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:06,128
Miles, calm down, all right?
It was an honest mistake.

1047
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:10,061
What?

1048
01:21:12,401 --> 01:21:17,168
You know what? I think we're gonna have
to go at this without you, man.

1049
01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:19,969
You're gonna what?

1050
01:21:22,812 --> 01:21:26,407
No, no.
This is just as much mine as it is yours.

1051
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:29,109
We've been working on this for over a year.

1052
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:32,779
I know that.
But your heart just isn't in this anymore.

1053
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:40,119
Are you serious?

1054
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:47,860
Fine.

1055
01:21:49,705 --> 01:21:50,797
Fine.

1056
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:56,440
You know what? I don't even care.
Honestly, I don't even care.

1057
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:57,773
You know why?

1058
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:02,249
'Cause no one in the real world gives a shit
about the 2.09 Competition.

1059
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:05,217
You know, it's just something
that you build up in your head

1060
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,312
to make yourselves feel important.

1061
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,323
You guys are pathetic.

1062
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:10,585
Thanks.

1063
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:18,965
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.

1064
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:22,834
- Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1065
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:29,467
Good evening, Mr. Youngman,
welcome back to the Red Rock.

1066
01:22:29,578 --> 01:22:31,045
Nice to see you.

1067
01:22:31,147 --> 01:22:33,809
Anything I can do for you, let me know.

1068
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:52,732
Double down.

1069
01:23:28,471 --> 01:23:31,497
I guess you play big
or you don't play at all.

1070
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:33,936
Right?

1071
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:40,472
Honey, there you are. Let's go.
We don't wanna miss the show!

1072
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:43,381
Honey, we're actually playing a game here.

1073
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:44,945
Yeah.

1074
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,117
Yeah, so you know what?

1075
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:51,284
Why don't you run upstairs
and wait for me there? Okay?

1076
01:23:53,896 --> 01:23:55,727
All right. Let's go.

1077
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:02,894
Yeah, all right.

1078
01:24:03,506 --> 01:24:06,100
I've got the worst headache right now.

1079
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:21,953
- Ten.
- Come on, monkey.

1080
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,423
- Fourteen.
- Come on. Come on, monkey.

1081
01:24:24,527 --> 01:24:26,654
- Sixteen.
- Monkey. Come on.

1082
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,396
Twenty-one.

1083
01:24:35,838 --> 01:24:37,772
Pete, you're killing us.

1084
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,011
I guess it's not my night.

1085
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:20,074
Are you out of your mind?

1086
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,475
I don't know what happened.

1087
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:26,380
I messed up. I'm sorry.

1088
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:28,784
Oh, you're sorry.

1089
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:32,486
Well, see, now that's what I've been waiting
to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.

1090
01:25:32,595 --> 01:25:37,157
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry!
Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!

1091
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:41,327
So we can all go back to being friends
and laughing over cocktails!

1092
01:25:42,538 --> 01:25:43,903
Come on, Micky. It can happen to anyone.

1093
01:25:44,006 --> 01:25:45,439
They get on a rush and they lose control.

1094
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:47,168
You shut your mouth. This is business.

1095
01:25:47,276 --> 01:25:50,643
Hey, I let you down, all right? I get it.

1096
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:54,580
Excuse me? You let me down? I don't care!

1097
01:25:55,217 --> 01:25:58,345
Let me make one thing clear to you,
I am not your father!

1098
01:25:58,454 --> 01:26:01,480
You are not my friend. This is a business.

1099
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:03,884
You are only as good to me
as the money you make,

1100
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,688
and, right now,
it's not worth a hell of a lot!

1101
01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:07,523
You're gonna give me back
everything you lost.

1102
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:10,394
I can't do that! That money was for Harvard!

1103
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:12,399
I have made you so much more
than what I just lost!

1104
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,332
It doesn't matter, Ben.

1105
01:26:14,436 --> 01:26:17,564
You had very clear instructions,
and you didn't follow them.

1106
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:21,609
You didn't do your job.
You weren't counting, you were gambling!

1107
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:27,047
Well, why aren't you out there, then, Micky?

1108
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:32,315
I mean, we take all the risks.
Seems to me like you don't do shit.

1109
01:26:37,026 --> 01:26:38,960
This isn't about me,

1110
01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:43,492
you arrogant little infant.

1111
01:26:56,412 --> 01:26:59,040
You can all find your own way
back to Boston.

1112
01:26:59,148 --> 01:27:03,209
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.

1113
01:27:03,319 --> 01:27:05,310
And you damn well know it.

1114
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:16,887
I need a drink.

1115
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:21,168
Anybody else?

1116
01:27:24,206 --> 01:27:25,935
Yeah, well, we don't need him.

1117
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,702
- Yeah, okay, Ben.
- No, I'm serious.

1118
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,472
Why do we need him?
We have our own money now.

1119
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:33,844
You know, his cut was 50%,
and he doesn't even play!

1120
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:35,576
Why do we need him?

1121
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:36,776
Hey, you know what I think?

1122
01:27:36,885 --> 01:27:40,218
I think we play out the weekend,
and I think we do this without him.

1123
01:27:40,322 --> 01:27:41,721
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.

1124
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,054
I think we should go back to Boston
and figure this out.

1125
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,956
Yeah, well,
why don't we let the team decide?

1126
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:49,189
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing.
Micky brought us together.

1127
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:51,289
And then he drove us apart.

1128
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:54,426
I mean, you saw
how he played Fisher against me.

1129
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:59,000
Choi, what do you say, man?
You wanna make some money?

1130
01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:02,170
- Kind of.
- Really?

1131
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:06,210
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.

1132
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:09,478
All I'm saying is that we try it. You know?

1133
01:28:09,585 --> 01:28:13,385
If we make the investment,
then we take all of the winnings.

1134
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:15,753
All of it.

1135
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:24,195
Okay.

1136
01:28:28,504 --> 01:28:29,562
Yeah.

1137
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:32,098
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1138
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:35,036
Choi?

1139
01:28:36,412 --> 01:28:37,674
I'm in.

1140
01:28:39,548 --> 01:28:41,243
Now I need a drink.

1141
01:28:47,222 --> 01:28:48,985
- What are you doing?
- What?

1142
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:51,059
What are you doing?

1143
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,219
Well, we're printing money.

1144
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:56,358
What, you think just 'cause Micky left
that we're gonna stop?

1145
01:28:56,465 --> 01:28:59,263
No, I could do this. I can lead this team.

1146
01:28:59,635 --> 01:29:02,900
You know, I'm not the same guy
I was back in Boston.

1147
01:29:03,372 --> 01:29:05,602
- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.

1148
01:29:06,108 --> 01:29:08,736
You know, isn't this exactly
who you wanted me to be

1149
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:11,836
when you first came into the store
to buy a tie?

1150
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:18,780
<i>What happened to " $300,000 and I'm out"?</i>

1151
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:22,418
<i>What happened to " a means to an end"?</i>

1152
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:26,191
- How much do you have?
- What?

1153
01:29:26,295 --> 01:29:28,490
- How much do you have?
- I got enough.

1154
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:30,827
Come on, Ben. How much do you have
saved back in Boston?

1155
01:29:30,933 --> 01:29:33,458
I've got 315 grand, all right?

1156
01:29:33,836 --> 01:29:36,134
Then why are you still here?

1157
01:29:37,473 --> 01:29:41,432
Because I wanna still be here.
I like being here.

1158
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,742
So does everybody else.

1159
01:29:44,146 --> 01:29:46,842
So come on, Jill. Are you in?

1160
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:55,485
You are the big player, Ben.

1161
01:29:55,591 --> 01:29:56,956
Yes, I am.

1162
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,294
Yeah, can I get a drink?

1163
01:30:29,224 --> 01:30:31,158
Rose, I wanna thank you.

1164
01:30:32,194 --> 01:30:34,560
You have been most accommodating.

1165
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:37,098
All right, that's for you.

1166
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:39,697
Okay, take care. Hey, good luck.

1167
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:49,267
Hey, how we doing here, people?

1168
01:31:00,589 --> 01:31:03,990
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold
while I track him down.

1169
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:09,723
Just got an interesting call.

1170
01:31:11,834 --> 01:31:15,895
There's nobody left to fire us.
Planet Hollywood is our last client.

1171
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:20,240
I don't know about that.

1172
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:27,314
This is Cole.

1173
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:40,891
Queen of diamonds. Your lady luck tonight.

1174
01:31:41,396 --> 01:31:43,023
You're doing good.

1175
01:31:43,332 --> 01:31:45,095
You're a real winner.

1176
01:31:49,872 --> 01:31:52,568
Sometimes. Just like everybody else.

1177
01:31:53,642 --> 01:31:55,837
Now, why don't I believe that?

1178
01:31:57,946 --> 01:32:00,005
Maybe you're just smarter
than everybody else, huh?

1179
01:32:00,115 --> 01:32:02,777
Yeah, I bet it's been
that way your entire life.

1180
01:32:02,885 --> 01:32:06,651
Except it just recently started
paying dividends, am I right?

1181
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:09,755
I'd split them.

1182
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:14,295
Deck's heavy as hell and since
I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.

1183
01:32:21,103 --> 01:32:23,196
Kianna. I think
we have a serious problem over there.

1184
01:32:23,305 --> 01:32:24,772
- Walk now!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1185
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:27,933
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you.
Let's go, Jill. Let's go.

1186
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,772
I think we need
to call security or something.

1187
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:33,473
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help.
Let's go! Come on.

1188
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:40,054
Let's take a walk, huh?

1189
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:44,555
Come on, kid.
See if we can't get you that chicken dinner.

1190
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:52,325
It's called Biometrics.

1191
01:32:52,434 --> 01:32:56,666
Biometrics. It's sort of like
a fingerprint of your face.

1192
01:32:59,308 --> 01:33:04,541
See, when the player sits down
at the table, the software, it reads this...

1193
01:33:04,646 --> 01:33:06,113
Biometric profile.

1194
01:33:06,214 --> 01:33:07,977
...biometric profile of your face,

1195
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:11,109
cross-references it
with a database of counters.

1196
01:33:14,656 --> 01:33:19,457
Software'll probably put you and me
out of business, but it still can't do this.

1197
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:23,928
All right.

1198
01:33:29,504 --> 01:33:32,371
You understand all this. You go to MIT.

1199
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:34,140
Smart boy.

1200
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,544
My name is Cole Williams.

1201
01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:41,411
And if I ever see you in this town again,

1202
01:33:42,184 --> 01:33:45,585
I will break your cheek bone
with a small hammer,

1203
01:33:46,822 --> 01:33:48,813
and then I will kill you.

1204
01:33:53,495 --> 01:33:57,056
Please. Please just take the money.

1205
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,824
You can take it.

1206
01:34:02,537 --> 01:34:03,868
Tell me,

1207
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:09,172
how's good old Professor Rosa doing, huh?

1208
01:34:10,846 --> 01:34:15,442
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky, we go way back.

1209
01:34:16,551 --> 01:34:19,543
I spent years,
chased him all over this town.

1210
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:24,948
Giving him beat downs left and right,
only to find him at the tables a week later.

1211
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,028
He was very persistent.

1212
01:34:27,929 --> 01:34:31,228
And then, one September night,

1213
01:34:31,733 --> 01:34:34,634
when I was in Barstow
at my father's funeral,

1214
01:34:35,504 --> 01:34:38,940
my casino was taken for seven figures.

1215
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:40,372
Can you imagine that?

1216
01:34:40,475 --> 01:34:43,706
The most ever taken by a single counter
in one night.

1217
01:34:43,812 --> 01:34:48,408
'Course I was, naturally,
unceremoniously fired.

1218
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,882
Funny thing, though.

1219
01:34:53,288 --> 01:34:55,813
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.

1220
01:34:56,992 --> 01:34:58,118
Never.

1221
01:36:24,846 --> 01:36:26,973
<i>Cauchy was the first
to make a rigorous study</i>

1222
01:36:27,082 --> 01:36:31,109
of the conditions for convergence
of an infinite series.

1223
01:36:31,219 --> 01:36:33,517
And was concerned with developing

1224
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:38,491
the basic theorems of the calculus
as rigorously as possible.

1225
01:36:39,895 --> 01:36:41,328
Any questions?

1226
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:43,857
No? All right, moving on.

1227
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:48,893
Isn't it true Cauchy
stole from his students?

1228
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:57,676
Yes, I heard that.
What's your theory on that?

1229
01:36:58,713 --> 01:37:03,241
They say he used his students
for their brilliance,

1230
01:37:04,386 --> 01:37:08,618
then discredited them
and stole their equations,

1231
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:12,557
stole their hard work.

1232
01:37:15,263 --> 01:37:17,959
Well, that wouldn't be the first time
a teacher was accused of that.

1233
01:37:18,066 --> 01:37:22,765
I think what he's referring to
is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?

1234
01:37:22,871 --> 01:37:25,806
He was a student of Cauchy's
who accused Cauchy

1235
01:37:25,907 --> 01:37:29,240
of stealing his four-volume text
on this analysis

1236
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:31,812
and publishing it under a pseudonym.

1237
01:37:33,648 --> 01:37:35,309
Of course, nobody knows
what really went down there.

1238
01:37:35,417 --> 01:37:39,410
They never did prove it, and without the
proof, it's a little like it never happened.

1239
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:41,546
And, you know, it's a real shame,

1240
01:37:41,656 --> 01:37:45,854
because if Stupnitsky had just realized
that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,

1241
01:37:45,961 --> 01:37:47,690
this was the dispute,

1242
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:54,726
if he'd been able to get beyond some
of the personal mistakes that were made,

1243
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:58,501
I have no doubt that Cauchy
would have worked with him again,

1244
01:37:58,607 --> 01:38:01,633
and they could have
done great things together.

1245
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:06,104
But, as history shows us,
some students never learn.

1246
01:38:07,816 --> 01:38:09,477
You should get that eye looked at.

1247
01:38:46,688 --> 01:38:48,087
You okay?

1248
01:38:51,059 --> 01:38:52,686
Everything's gone.

1249
01:38:54,496 --> 01:38:57,090
- What?
- Micky's taken everything.

1250
01:38:57,198 --> 01:39:01,430
He's taken the money,
taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.

1251
01:39:03,305 --> 01:39:05,398
- What are you talking about?
- Micky, he's taken everything.

1252
01:39:05,507 --> 01:39:07,907
I gotta find a way to get it back.

1253
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:10,700
Are you insane?

1254
01:39:11,313 --> 01:39:14,874
You just got the shit kicked out of you
and you won't let this go!

1255
01:39:14,983 --> 01:39:18,919
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill?
I've just lost everything!

1256
01:39:19,688 --> 01:39:21,178
Look, please...

1257
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:25,255
I don't want to lose you, too.

1258
01:39:28,263 --> 01:39:31,858
Ben, you were dragged away in Vegas.

1259
01:39:32,534 --> 01:39:36,868
I haven't heard from you.
I had no idea where you were.

1260
01:39:37,572 --> 01:39:38,800
I know.

1261
01:39:39,774 --> 01:39:40,934
I know.

1262
01:39:48,283 --> 01:39:51,081
You know, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

1263
01:39:52,887 --> 01:39:54,252
I'm sorry.

1264
01:39:57,125 --> 01:40:01,619
In Vegas, I don't know what happened.
That wasn't me.

1265
01:40:02,831 --> 01:40:04,458
Look, you know me.

1266
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,031
You know what I'm like.

1267
01:40:08,837 --> 01:40:10,327
You know me.

1268
01:40:16,778 --> 01:40:18,643
I need you to trust me.

1269
01:40:19,981 --> 01:40:23,348
<i>And the winner of this year's 2.09</i>

1270
01:40:23,451 --> 01:40:29,720
<i>for excellence in the field of robotics
goes to the team of Conolly and Kazazi!</i>

1271
01:41:07,095 --> 01:41:10,064
That's it. That's the story.

1272
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:14,797
Jill Taylor. Really?

1273
01:41:15,603 --> 01:41:19,095
- Yeah. Yeah, really.
- Wow.

1274
01:41:19,207 --> 01:41:23,405
<i>Yeah, it doesn't feel like " wow," Miles.
I really screwed up.</i>

1275
01:41:23,511 --> 01:41:28,244
Yeah, you did.
But you had a life experience.

1276
01:41:32,687 --> 01:41:34,678
I can't believe how I treated you, Miles.

1277
01:41:34,789 --> 01:41:38,691
You know, you're my best friend,
and I really let you down.

1278
01:41:39,561 --> 01:41:42,655
I really let you down. I'm sorry.

1279
01:41:44,466 --> 01:41:48,994
And I'm happy for you, you know?
Winning the 2.09? That's great.

1280
01:41:50,371 --> 01:41:52,839
- Jill Taylor. Really?
- Yeah.

1281
01:41:55,376 --> 01:41:57,469
So let me get this straight.

1282
01:41:58,146 --> 01:42:01,309
Money, girls,

1283
01:42:02,484 --> 01:42:06,887
high-roller suites, clubs, Vegas.

1284
01:42:08,089 --> 01:42:13,117
Yeah, I think I probably would have
blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.

1285
01:42:16,664 --> 01:42:18,029
So we cool?

1286
01:42:19,667 --> 01:42:21,259
Yeah, we're cool.

1287
01:42:21,769 --> 01:42:24,465
But you better believe that
you're gonna make this up to me, big time.

1288
01:42:24,572 --> 01:42:25,834
All right.

1289
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:29,268
So, what are you gonna do now?

1290
01:43:20,061 --> 01:43:21,892
What do you want, Ben?
This is an alumni dinner.

1291
01:43:21,996 --> 01:43:24,362
You need a diploma
to come to one of these.

1292
01:43:24,465 --> 01:43:26,865
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.

1293
01:43:33,074 --> 01:43:34,041
What?

1294
01:43:34,142 --> 01:43:38,272
Look, I've had some time
to think about what you said.

1295
01:43:40,148 --> 01:43:41,638
I want back in.

1296
01:43:42,617 --> 01:43:46,485
- Why now?
- Because I have nothing else.

1297
01:43:48,356 --> 01:43:51,553
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to
you. You're good, you're very, very good.

1298
01:43:51,659 --> 01:43:55,823
But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.

1299
01:43:55,930 --> 01:43:59,627
Now you tell me why in the world
I'd ever get back in business with you.

1300
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:04,194
Look, I know I should never have
disrespected you, all right? I know that.

1301
01:44:05,173 --> 01:44:07,141
With this facial recognition software,

1302
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:10,438
our window of opportunity
is closing in on us.

1303
01:44:10,979 --> 01:44:14,642
Now, I need this, Micky.
I really, really need this.

1304
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:19,880
Well, the take would have to be really, really
good to get me even vaguely interested.

1305
01:44:21,389 --> 01:44:26,691
Well, you know, that's why I was thinking
maybe you should be the other big player.

1306
01:44:28,096 --> 01:44:31,429
You know, two big players playing big?

1307
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:35,933
Hey, slow down,
I haven't played in a long time, Ben.

1308
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:41,967
But Fisher's out.

1309
01:44:42,844 --> 01:44:47,213
No one else on the team
can be the big player, can they?

1310
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:53,852
And if we do well, if we do really well,

1311
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:57,785
then you get your grades back,
get to Harvard Med,

1312
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:01,318
and I might even get that sabbatical.

1313
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:06,790
Well, amazing things can be done
from the inside, right?

1314
01:45:08,736 --> 01:45:11,432
Just went back to the head of the class.

1315
01:45:12,707 --> 01:45:14,572
I gotta go be social.

1316
01:45:19,947 --> 01:45:23,246
All right, now listen.
It's different out there this time.

1317
01:45:23,351 --> 01:45:26,218
The stakes are high
and it's more dangerous.

1318
01:45:26,754 --> 01:45:29,814
But the return is gonna be the biggest.

1319
01:45:31,125 --> 01:45:34,561
Now they know our faces,
so we're gonna wear disguises.

1320
01:45:34,796 --> 01:45:36,764
And we can't mess around.

1321
01:45:37,131 --> 01:45:38,598
I'm glad you're back with us, Micky.

1322
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,600
Well, I couldn't let you guys
come back to this town

1323
01:45:40,702 --> 01:45:44,194
and not prove to Ben
that I can do more than just teach.

1324
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:48,941
But as we've all said, this game
is about the past and the future,

1325
01:45:49,043 --> 01:45:52,103
and tonight we forget about the past.

1326
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:54,211
We just focus on the future.

1327
01:45:54,315 --> 01:45:57,648
Right. This is our last time.

1328
01:45:58,052 --> 01:46:01,078
Now, we all know the drill if things get
ugly. We meet at the Fox Strip Club.

1329
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:03,521
Nobody leaves this town alone.

1330
01:46:06,994 --> 01:46:08,894
Let's go make a killing.

1331
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:10,795
All right.

1332
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,388
Let's see what we can do with this.

1333
01:46:44,499 --> 01:46:48,560
Seems like I'm having one of those days,
you know what I mean, Jim?

1334
01:46:50,238 --> 01:46:52,365
I'm bringing all the luck today.
I'm just bringing it all.

1335
01:46:52,473 --> 01:46:56,933
Anyone who's in any kind of contact
with me is getting so much luck today.

1336
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:10,750
Winner, winner, chicken dinner! There it is.

1337
01:47:10,858 --> 01:47:14,294
Thank you. God, I love this town.
I love this game.

1338
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:18,395
And, Jim, I might even love you.

1339
01:47:28,209 --> 01:47:30,404
Hey, you mind if I sit down?

1340
01:47:44,425 --> 01:47:45,483
What's your name?

1341
01:47:45,593 --> 01:47:48,721
Shane? I'm about to change your luck.
It's gonna become mine.

1342
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:51,060
There you go, give me it all.

1343
01:48:01,108 --> 01:48:02,302
There you go.

1344
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:06,842
Thank you. Thank you.

1345
01:48:11,586 --> 01:48:13,816
Such a shame, Shane!

1346
01:48:14,789 --> 01:48:16,848
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?

1347
01:48:16,958 --> 01:48:21,292
- Is this your first time, darling?
- I've been winning and losing for hours.

1348
01:48:21,395 --> 01:48:23,488
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

1349
01:48:36,811 --> 01:48:38,335
What the hell kind of streak
are you on, boy?

1350
01:48:38,446 --> 01:48:41,108
This never happens, this never happens.

1351
01:48:54,161 --> 01:48:55,958
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.

1352
01:48:56,063 --> 01:48:57,621
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens!

1353
01:48:57,732 --> 01:48:59,594
- Split tens!
- Again!

1354
01:49:22,523 --> 01:49:25,492
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Give me the chips, Blanca.

1355
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:28,592
Give me the chips!
Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.

1356
01:49:28,696 --> 01:49:31,597
Come on, just give me the chips!

1357
01:49:31,699 --> 01:49:35,829
- My bus has to leave right away.
- I gotta walk my dog.

1358
01:49:35,937 --> 01:49:38,497
- I'm sorry we're making such a mess.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1359
01:49:38,606 --> 01:49:41,666
Nice to see you. Have a good night, darling.

1360
01:49:47,214 --> 01:49:48,511
This way!

1361
01:49:59,727 --> 01:50:00,819
Go.

1362
01:50:15,176 --> 01:50:16,541
This way!

1363
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:24,441
Come on, Jill. Come on!

1364
01:50:34,362 --> 01:50:36,956
Go that way. Throw me the chips.
Come on, we gotta separate.

1365
01:50:37,064 --> 01:50:39,931
Give me the chips, I'll meet you at Fox's.

1366
01:50:46,007 --> 01:50:47,599
Go, go, go, go!

1367
01:50:58,552 --> 01:51:00,213
Come on, come on.

1368
01:51:03,324 --> 01:51:04,882
Move, move, move!

1369
01:51:09,063 --> 01:51:10,325
Come on.

1370
01:51:11,465 --> 01:51:13,057
Go, go, this way.

1371
01:51:25,046 --> 01:51:26,877
All right, let's go.

1372
01:51:34,955 --> 01:51:37,446
Go, go, go, go! Airport!

1373
01:51:56,010 --> 01:51:57,637
<i>I never saw Micky Rosa after that.</i>

1374
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:03,978
Oh, God.

1375
01:52:05,086 --> 01:52:07,350
But I think I wanna see him now.

1376
01:52:08,422 --> 01:52:10,890
And I want you to make that happen.

1377
01:52:15,162 --> 01:52:17,596
I don't work for Micky anymore.

1378
01:52:20,601 --> 01:52:22,034
Come on, kid.

1379
01:52:23,871 --> 01:52:27,637
Your picture's all over the database.
Your Vegas gig is done.

1380
01:52:28,676 --> 01:52:30,610
But I will give you one night.

1381
01:52:30,711 --> 01:52:33,771
And I can guarantee
that you won't be bothered.

1382
01:52:34,682 --> 01:52:38,448
You'll make a killing,
and you'll keep it all.

1383
01:52:41,522 --> 01:52:42,716
Listen.

1384
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:45,758
My name's Cole.

1385
01:52:47,328 --> 01:52:48,852
Cole Williams.

1386
01:52:50,764 --> 01:52:53,164
You just bring me Micky Rosa, kid.

1387
01:52:53,467 --> 01:52:55,492
I'll take care of the rest.

1388
01:52:58,038 --> 01:53:00,973
Son of a bitch.

1389
01:53:43,617 --> 01:53:45,380
Who the hell are you?

1390
01:54:08,242 --> 01:54:11,405
Ben. Good job.

1391
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:17,542
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk
with your professor, and that MIT thing?

1392
01:54:17,751 --> 01:54:19,844
It's gonna work out for you.

1393
01:54:21,422 --> 01:54:22,980
So that's it?

1394
01:54:24,425 --> 01:54:27,189
- That's it.
- All right.

1395
01:54:28,162 --> 01:54:29,857
Oh, Dr. Campbell?

1396
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:34,167
They don't have pensions
in my line of work.

1397
01:54:34,501 --> 01:54:36,401
And the software does
what it's supposed to do.

1398
01:54:36,503 --> 01:54:40,405
And I been chasing Micky Rosa around here
for too damn long.

1399
01:54:41,642 --> 01:54:43,906
I'm looking at some retirement.

1400
01:54:45,813 --> 01:54:47,280
Leave the bag.

1401
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:51,648
No. No, no, no, no.

1402
01:54:51,752 --> 01:54:56,246
I need this money. You have no idea
what I went through to get this money.

1403
01:54:56,357 --> 01:55:01,351
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out
how to get everything you want in this life,

1404
01:55:01,462 --> 01:55:03,191
'cause you're smart.

1405
01:55:04,765 --> 01:55:09,293
So, you're gonna leave the bag.

1406
01:55:14,341 --> 01:55:18,937
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag.
It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.

1407
01:55:27,788 --> 01:55:29,585
I knew you were smart.

1408
01:55:48,442 --> 01:55:51,172
<i>I had a 1590 on my SAT.</i>

1409
01:55:51,278 --> 01:55:53,337
<i>I got a 44 on my MCATs.</i>

1410
01:55:53,847 --> 01:55:56,975
<i>And I have a 4.0 GPA from MIT.</i>

1411
01:55:57,084 --> 01:55:59,552
<i>I thought I had my life mapped out.</i>

1412
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:02,547
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1413
01:56:02,656 --> 01:56:06,114
<i>what my Nonlinear Equations professor
once told me,</i>

1414
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:09,891
<i>"Always account for variable change. "</i>

1415
01:56:11,699 --> 01:56:13,223
Hello, Micky.

1416
01:56:14,935 --> 01:56:16,766
Look, I got money in Boston.
A hundred grand.

1417
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:18,895
I'll give it to you.
Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.

1418
01:56:19,006 --> 01:56:22,066
I don't want your money, Micky.
I don't need it.

1419
01:56:27,881 --> 01:56:30,679
But I know someone
who might be interested.

1420
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:35,147
He's good with numbers, too.
He works for the IRS.

1421
01:56:43,964 --> 01:56:46,023
<i>I let down my good friends.</i>

1422
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:51,637
<i>But as it turns out,
they weren't too bad at simple math either.</i>

1423
01:57:17,464 --> 01:57:20,024
<i>I scored the prettiest girl in school.</i>

1424
01:57:23,504 --> 01:57:26,132
<i>I got beaten down
by an old-school Vegas thug</i>

1425
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:29,437
<i>who was having trouble
accepting his retirement.</i>

1426
01:57:30,744 --> 01:57:34,510
<i>But I worked out a deal with him
that got him a nice pension.</i>

1427
01:57:37,885 --> 01:57:40,683
<i>And I lied to my mother.</i>

1428
01:57:41,155 --> 01:57:44,852
<i>But I confessed the lie,
and, well, she still loved me.</i>

1429
01:58:01,375 --> 01:58:04,640
<i>So my senior year of college,
I joined this team.</i>

1430
01:58:05,045 --> 01:58:07,206
<i>And I learned this new skill.</i>

1431
01:58:07,448 --> 01:58:10,474
<i>I went to Vegas 17 times to use it.</i>

1432
01:58:12,653 --> 01:58:16,180
<i>I made hundreds of thousands of dollars
counting cards.</i>

1433
01:58:17,224 --> 01:58:19,784
And then I had it all stolen from me.

1434
01:58:20,727 --> 01:58:21,887
Twice.

1435
01:58:23,197 --> 01:58:27,293
How's that for life experience, professor?
Did I dazzle you?

1436
01:58:28,469 --> 01:58:31,307
Did I jump off the page?
