00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,666
Ladies and gentlemen of NASA,
this is the voice of Charles Xavier.

167
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,873
Could somebody please
apprise me of the situation?

168
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,050
We were picking up
solar flares.

169
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,549
We believe the heat
shorted out their electricity.

170
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,925
<i>They lost control,
communication, orientation,</i>

171
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,597
<i>pretty much everything.</i>

172
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,051
Not to worry, Mission Control.
Help is on the way.

173
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,387
(engine roaring)

174
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,529
I think this is not as much
fun as I thought it would be.

175
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,984
(rattling)

176
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,184
RAVEN:
That's a solar flare?

177
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,561
HANK: I've never seen
a reading like this.

178
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,288
The orientation thruster's misfiring.

179
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,250
- That cabin won't hold for long.
- Kurt, can you get in there?

180
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,961
It's spinning too fast.
I can't see inside the window.

181
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,172
Scott, I need you
to blast that thruster,

182
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,881
- slow down the spin.
- (clicks)

183
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,744
Kurt, take Peter. Go!

184
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,830
(alarm blaring)

185
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,835
RAVEN:
<i>Storm, seal those cracks.</i>

186
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,208
(breathes deeply)

187
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,090
Be right back.

188
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,810
Oh, shit.

189
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,512
- Strap in, we're headed home.
- ASTRONAUT: Wait.

190
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,402
Our commander, he's not here.

191
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,037
He was in the airlock
working on the thruster.

192
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,165
The heat signature's
rising fast.

193
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,372
I can't hold it any longer.

194
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,128
We gotta get out of here.
I said strap in.

195
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,631
No, Raven. No.
We're not leaving anyone behind.

196
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,054
I am not putting this team
in more danger.

197
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,132
What about their team?

198
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,625
Jean can hold
that shuttle together.

199
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,517
<i>Can't you, Jean?</i>

200
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,767
You know you can do anything
you set your mind to.

201
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,565
I can hold the ship together
but not from here.

202
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,064
- I need to get inside.
- The heat's spiking.

203
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,965
We've got less than a minute
till those flares hit.

204
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,321
She said she can do it.

205
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,316
Thirty seconds.

206
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,780
Count it down. Go.

207
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,994
(alarm blaring)

208
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,050
(metal creaking)

209
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,967
(beeping)

210
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,723
We got 20 seconds.

211
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,278
Ten...

212
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,357
<i>nine, eight...</i>

213
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,157

three...

217
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,992
<i>two...</i>

218
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,083
one.

219
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,626
(groans)

220
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,378
SCOTT: Where's Jean?
Kurt, where is she?

221
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,711
- Where is she?
- (gasping): I'm sorry!

222
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,842
(alarm blaring)

223
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,886
Brace for impact.

224
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,020
(labored breathing)

225
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,779
(panting)

226
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,451
(panting)

227
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,662

230
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,950
(weakly): Is every...

231
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,533
Is everybody okay?

232
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,703
Yeah, we're okay.
(gasps, sighs)

233
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,378
(sighs)

234
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,212
So let's go home.

235
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,058
(cheering, whistling)

236
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,346
- Yay, X-Men! Woo!
- Yeah!

237
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,432
(cheering)

238
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,482
Yeah! X-Men!

239
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,689
(cheering, whistling)

240
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,526
(children chanting)

241
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,713
(cheering, whistling)

242
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,290
(CHARLES chuckling)

243
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,840
CHARLES: That's enough,
boys and girls. That's enough.

244
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,932
The X-Men have today done
an incredibly brave thing.

245
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,761
They've once again proved to humanity
exactly why they need us,

246
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,016
people like yourselves.

247
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,939
The president sends his regards,

248
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,062
as well as his
heartfelt gratitude.

249
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,896
And, as for myself,
I've never been prouder.

250
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,862
Enjoy yourselves.
You certainly deserve it.

251
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,159
In fact, you all do.

252
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,611
No more class,
the end of the day.

253
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,912
(cheers)

254
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,541
Jean?

255
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,952
You gave us quite a scare up there.
How are you feeling?

256
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,874
(stammers)
Actually, I... I feel fine.

257
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,004
- Hank?
- Yeah?

258
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,196
Would you take a look at Jean?

259
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,553
Standard medical
for anyone injured in the field.

260
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,005
Thank you.

261
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,977
RAVEN: You know, the president
was almost sending his condolences.

262
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,646
- She should be dead.
- Thankfully, she's not.

263
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,105
I basically did everything.

264
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,562
I mean, Jean did a little,
like towards the end,

265
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,363
but it was mostly all me.

266
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,409
(door closes)

267
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,111
You put us in danger, Charles.

268
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,039
You put those kids in danger.

269
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,294
They're not kids anymore, Raven.

270
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,873
And I care about their safety
just as much as you do.

271
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,129
Are you sure about that?

272
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,802
'Cause we're taking bigger
and bigger risks.

273
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:00,970
And for what?

274
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,095
Please, tell me it's not your ego.

275
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,892
Being on the cover
of magazines,

276
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,015
getting a medal from the president.

277
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,471
You like it, don't you?

278
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,522
As opposed to being
hunted and despised?

279
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,975
Well, you know, actually, I do.

280
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,152
It's all just a means
to an end, Raven.

281
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,775
- What end is that?
- Keeping us safe.

282
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,259
You should understand
better than anyone

283
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,195
that we're only ever
one bad day away

284
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,527
from them starting to see us
as the enemy again.

285
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,863
So, what?
We wear matching costumes

286
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,434
and smile in pictures
to make everyone feel safe?

287
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,186
That is a small price to pay
for keeping the peace.

288
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,453
- By risking our people to save theirs?
- Yes! Yes!

289
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,379
It's funny.

290
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,552
I can't actually remember the last time

291
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,095
you were the one risking something.

292
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,638
And by the way,

293
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,137
the women are always saving
the men around here.

294
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,640
You might wanna think about
changing the name to X-Women.

295
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,766
(door opens)

296
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,348
HANK: Your heartbeat's strong,
pulse is good,

297
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,308
brain activity is normal.

298
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,654
The genetic reading,

299
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,855
I'm gonna take another look at.

300
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,735
What can't be right?

301
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,516
Did you just read my mind
without permission?

302
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,659
Sorry, I didn't mean to,
but what can't be right?

303
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,880
Whatever happened up there
made you stronger.

304
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,736
You know, I've never seen
a power reading like this.

305
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,049
You're-You're literally...
I mean, you're off the charts.

306
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,381
So what does that mean?

307
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,716
It means, um...

308
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,307
we'll have to build a better machine.

309
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,561
But... how do you feel?

310
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,060
I feel good.

311
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,395
Good.

312
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,902
Well, as far as I can tell,
you're good to go.

313
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,200
- You can head upstairs.
- All right.

314
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,987
Thanks, Hank.

315
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,744
SCOTT:
<i>Hank said that?</i>

316
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,454
- "Off the charts"?
- He did.

317
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,505
The big blue furry guy?
The doctor? That Hank?

318
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,083
JEAN:
That's the one. Why?

319
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,504
You a little intimidated, maybe?

320
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,590
Constantly.

321
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,684
- Jean. Jean...
- Hmm?

322
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,100
Are you...
Are you sure you're okay?

323
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,693
I'm better than okay.
God, I feel great, I do.

324
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,318
I don't know, I feel like
everything is just...

325
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,149
turned up.

326
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,943
Yeah.

327
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,156
- No, it's just...
- Just what?

328
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,161
I thought I lost you today.

329
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,745
I know.

330
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,586
But I came back to you.

331
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,802
I'll always come back to you.

332
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,437

Is that Luna?

339
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,213
Probably just squirrels.

- (Luna barking)
- Mm...?

341
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,508
I'm just gonna check on her.
I'll be right back.

342
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,634
Just stay.

343
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,768
- Tell her to shut up.
- Luna!

344
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,596

383
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,699
Thanks.

384
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,739

- She's, uh...

385
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,906
- thirsty.
- Yeah, I see that.

386
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,833
Does she seem okay to you?

387
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,832
For someone who's just been
hit with solar flares...

00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,290
- I'd say she's doing pretty good.
- Thanks.

389
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,128
You know, it wasn't so long ago

390
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,047
we were throwing parties like this.

391
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,680
Now we're the only ones left.

392
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,388
Yeah. Last of the first class.

393
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,643
I've been thinking.

394
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:31,024
Maybe it's time for us to...
move on.

395
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,196
What do you...
Move on where?

396
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,525
I don't know.
It's just Charles.

397
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,951
Whatever is going on between
you two, it will blow over.

398
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,075
No, it won't.

399
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,452
I love him,
but he's different.

400
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,959
Everything is...
it's different now.

401
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,628
Yeah.

402
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,297
We changed the world
so we could live in it.

403
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,500
Yeah, but maybe
that's what we should go do.

404
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,052
Yeah, but this is our life.
This is what we wanted.

405
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,050
- Not like this.
- Raven...

406
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,134
It's not our life, Hank.
It's his.

407
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,811
What do you think the "X"
in X-Men stands for?

408
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,686
Charles and his X-Men
are where we turn

409
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,143
when facing our worst fears.

410
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,237
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,612
Thank you.

412
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,579
All I've really done
is create a world

413
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,625
in which children
can find peace and pride

414
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,794
in being different.

415
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,965
Now, I know that some of you
choose to call us "superheroes."

416
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,964
I must confess, I don't really
know what that word means,

417
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,282
but it is a damn sight better
than what you used to call us.

Come on, Scott.

422
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,358
Did... Did you hear
what the kids are calling you?

423
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,606

(CHARLES groans)

1140
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,525
<i>This could be your new home.</i>

1141
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,691
We could be your new family.

1142
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,244
No!

1143
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,993
Because you are not broken.

1144
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,415
(groaning)

1145
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,341
Then you'll take her?

1146
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,009
Yes.

1147
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,181
No!

1148
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:53,802
I can help her in ways
that you can't.

1149
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:56,142
She can't be helped.

1150
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,390
She's a lost cause.

1151
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:00,479
(groans)

1152
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:03,736
CHARLES:
<i>No, she's not.</i>

1153
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:06,155
As long as there's someone
to care for her, who believes,

1154
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:07,323
then there's still hope.

1155
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,694
(CHARLES grunting)

1156
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,864
Then there...

1157
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,699
There's still hope.

1158
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,549
(panting)

1159
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:33,429
I knew. I knew
you were still in there.

1160
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,308
VUK:
He just showed you your past.

1161
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,480
Follow me...

1162
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,687
into your future.

1163
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:48,741
No.

1164
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:50,285
(brakes screech)

1165
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,840
GUARD (over radio):
<i>Set weapons to neutralize.</i>

1166
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,125
I never asked for this.

1167
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,702
Any of it.

1168
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:05,544
I traveled to the stars
for a gift that you don't want.

1169
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:09,677
Then take it.

1170
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:13,472
Please.

1171
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,016
Free me.

1172
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,555
I'll try.

1173
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,158
(all grunting)

1174
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:44,714
(growls)

1175
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,586
(groans)

1176
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,522
(gasping)

1177
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,694
Stop it.
You're going to kill her.

1178
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,406
(whispering):
Your lives mean nothing.

1179
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:16,703
Your world will be ours.

1180
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,576
You'd kill us all.

1181
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,497
Yes.

1182
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:22,662
Jean, you have to let go.

1183
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,167
Jean, let go!

1184
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,083
Let go, Jean. Let go!

1185
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:34,504
Let go!

1186
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,728
GUARD:
There's one! Get him!

1187
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:43,931
(SCOTT grunts)

1188
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:46,943
Jean!

1189
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:55,785
Jean.

1190
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,576
Jean?

1191
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,784
Jean, Jean.

1192
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:02,353
- Charles, what's wrong?
- I don't know. I can't read her mind.

1193
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,621
GUARD 1: Come on, out!
Take him out!

1194
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,876
Come on, out, out!
You guys, come on. Train.

1195
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,277
GUARD 2:
You four with me, let's go!

1196
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,404
- GUARD 1: Let's go!
- GUARD 2: Come on, move!

1197
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,885
GUARD 1: Come on.
Move, move, move!

1198
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,439
- She's alive.
- Scott, you have to get her out.

1199
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,811
You have to... No!

1200
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,856
(indistinct radio chatter)

1201
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,110
GUARD:
We're clear!

1202
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:56,840
(indistinct shouting below)

1203
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,546
GUARD:
Last one.

1204
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,232
We need a clean sweep
on the last three blocks.

1205
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:03,552
Let's go!

1206
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,683
(siren wailing)

1207
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,904
(train horn blares)

1208
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,907
My kid used to be a fan.

1209
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,248
Raven had the right of it.

1210
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:36,835
Jean was never the villain.

1211
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,301
I was.

1212
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,769
I should never have lied to her.

1213
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:50,440
I was wrong.

1214
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,904
But this power...

1215
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,566
inside of her,
I never put that there.

1216
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,619
I would never do anything
intentionally to hurt her.

1217
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,618
That isn't me
and this is not Jean.

1218
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,621
We can still save her.

1219
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,203
She's still Jean inside.

1220
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:24,011
PILOT: <i>We're 10 miles out
from Mutant Containment Center.</i>

1221
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,683
<i>Prepare for prisoner transfer.</i>

1222
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,363
What exactly is controlling her?

1223
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:39,564
I don't know.

1224
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,150
But this woman, this...

1225
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,485
thing...

1226
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:44,786
has had a taste of that power,

1227
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,099
and she'll be coming back for more.

1228
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,785
She'll be coming
back for Jean.

1229
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:50,082
Good. Let her.

1230
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,535
CHARLES:
She'll kill her to get it.

1231
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:55,417
But I promise you,
the killing will not end there.

1232
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:58,045
SCOTT: That's not what Raven
would have wanted.

1233
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,047
You know that.

1234
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:02,170
You both do.

1235
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:06,720
(rattling)

1236
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:22,765
GUNNER:
<i>Skipper, are you seeing this?</i>

1237
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,779
Alpha One, you have multiple
hostiles onboard.

1238
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:29,153
<i>They're heading
towards the back.</i>

1239
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,119
- Open four to five.
- GUARD: <i>Copy that.</i>

1240
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,541
All right, you two,
come with me.

1241
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:34,745
The rest of you, stay here,
guard the prisoners!

1242
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,251
Don't be fools!
You need our help!

1243
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,128
LEAD GUARD:
Lock it down! Now!

1244
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,798
Goddamn muties
come to spring you.

1245
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,424
They're not mutants.

1246
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:45,908
Free us, you're going
to need our help.

1247
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,639
We're the only chance you have.

1248
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,012
Keep your mouth shut.

1249
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,020
- (grunts)
- (electricity crackling)

1250
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:02,776
(grunting and screaming)

1251
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,289
- (man groans)
- PILOT: <i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

1252
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:20,965
(engine sputtering)

1253
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:33,056
What's the status
on those mutants?

1254
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,513
LEAD GUARD:
<i>We're falling back now! They're not...</i>

1255
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,932
- What?
- (radio static crackles)

1256
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:40,067
They're not what?

1257
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,941
- LEAD GUARD: <i>They're not mutants!</i>
- They're here for Jean.

1258
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,943
(banging)

1259
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,365
GUARD:
Get ready to open fire!

1260
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,317
(stammers):
Your kid was right about us.

1261
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:49,619
We could help you!

1262
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:53,164
(thudding)

1263
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,840
Please!

1264
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:04,751
GUARD:
Fire!

1265
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:17,606
GUARD:
There's more!

1266
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,558
(grunting)

1267
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:30,242
(choking)

1268
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,798
We only want the girl.
Step aside.

1269
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:48,924
No!

1270
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,384
What are you doing?

1271
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,342
What Raven would have.

1272
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:56,393
(growling)

1273
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,120
Scott, get me to Jean!

1274
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:29,339
(grunting)

1275
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:45,142

(gasps and screams)

1277
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,237
Selene!

1278
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:00,626
Hank!

1279
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:01,959
(growls)

1280
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:03,502
Help Storm!

1281
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:23,939
(grunting)

1282
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,317
(bullet casings clattering)

1283
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:33,324
No, no, no, no, no, please.

1284
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,823
- (choking)
- Don't die. No.

1285
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:44,040
(yelling)

1286

01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,696
(grunting)

1290
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:30,943
CHARLES:
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1291
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,424
(grunting)

1292
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,671
Scott, guard the entrance.

1293
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:36,090
Jean, wake up.

1294
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,173
Jean, wake up.
You have to wake up now.

1295
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,732
(grunting)

1296
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,499
(wind howling)

1297
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:10,580
(pants)

1298
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:23,054
(metal creaking)

(growls)

1301
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,041
Hank!
