2
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:52,343
We come in peace
for cats and mice everywhere.

3
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,657
Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

4
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,460
Itchy... Itchy...

5
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,835
Boring!

6
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,129
Dad, we can't see the movie.

7
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:14,300
I can't believe we're paying to see
something we get on TV for free.

8
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,262
If you ask me, everybody in this theater
is a giant sucker.

9
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:21,265
Especially you.

10
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:21,974
Especially you.

11
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:27,480
Movie on the big screen!

12
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,099
Excuse me. My heinie is dipping.

13
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,825
All right, well,
thanks a lot for coming.

14
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,452
We've been playing
for three and a half hours.

15
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,999
Now we'd like just a minute of your time
to say something about the environment.

16
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,005
- You suck!
- Shut up and play!

17
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,674
- Preachy!
- We're not being preachy.

18
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,095
But the pollution in your lake,
it's dissolving our barge.

19
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:45,391
I thought they touched on
a vital issue.

20
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,560
I beg to differ.

21
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,818
Gentlemen, it's been an honor
playing with you tonight.

22
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,718
For the latest rock band
to die in our town...

23
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,970
...Lord, hear our prayer.

24
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:25,806
Lord, hear our prayer.

25
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,975
I hate being late.

26
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,310
Well, I hate going.

27
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,562
Why can't I worship the Lord
in my own way...

28
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,564
...by praying like hell on my deathbed?

29
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,483
Homer, they can hear you inside.

30
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:41,030
Relax. Those pious morons are too busy
talking to their phony-baloney God.

31
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,994
How you doing? Peace be with you.
Praise Jebus.

32
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,758
Today I'd like to try something
a little different.

33
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,219
I'm going to call on one of you!

34
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,348
Now, the word of God
dwells within everyone.

35
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,978
I want you to let that word out.
Let your spirit...

36
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,604
What is it, Ned?

37
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,274
The good Lord is telling me
to confess to something.

38
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,484
Gay, gay, gay.

39
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,821
An immodest sense of pride
in our community.

40
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,865
Somebody else?

41
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:28,286
Let the Lord's light shine upon you.

42
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,584
Feel the spirit.

43
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,961
Let it out!

44
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,464
Horrible, horrible things
are going to happen!

45
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,052
And they're gonna happen to you!
And you! And you! And you.

46
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,679
Whoa, nelly!

47
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,228
People of Springfield,
heed this warning:

48
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,646
Twisted tail!

49
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,106
A thousand eyes!

50
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,567
Trapped forever!

51
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,697
Dad, do something!

52
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,742
This book doesn't have any answers!

53
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,453
Beware! Beware! Time is short!

54
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,585
Believe me! Believe me!

55
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,594
Thanks for listening.

56
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,017
Okay, who wants waffles?

57
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,352
I do, I do, I do!

58
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,062
Wait a minute. What about Grampa?

59
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,855
- I want syrup!
- I want strawberries!

60
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,732
Something happened to that man.

61
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:44,612
I'll tell you what happened to him.
A certain someone had a senior moment.

62
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,660
But that's okay, because we love him
and we got a free rug out of it.

63
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,329
What is the point of going to church
every Sunday...

64
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,792
...when if someone we love has a genuine
religious experience, we ignore it?

65
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,794
Right, Grampa?

66
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,171
I want bananas on my waffles.

67
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,090
I rest my case.

68
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,635
I'm not dropping this.

69
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,767
Wait a minute. I'm still in the car.

70
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,894
Oh, right.

71
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,110
"Take out hornets' nest."

72
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,785
Check. "Fix sinkhole."

73
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,879
Check.

74
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,881
"Re-shingle roof"?

75
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,927
Steady.

76
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,056
Steady.

77
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,188
Why, you little...!

78
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:04,734
I'll teach you to laugh
at something that's funny!

79
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,945
You know, we are on the roof.
We could have some fun.

80
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,989
What kind of fun?

81
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,574
How about a dare contest?

82
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,952
That sounds fun. I dare you to...

83
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,704
...climb the TV antenna!

84
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,209
- Piece of cake.
- Earthquake!

85
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,884
Aftershock!

86
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,805
Homer, I don't mean
to be a Nervous Pervis...

87
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,851
...but if he falls, couldn't that
make your boy a paraplege-arino?

88
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,603
Shut up, Flanders.

89
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,523
- Yeah, shut up, Flanders.
- Well said, boy.

90
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,527
Steady. Steady.

91
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,861
Steady...

92
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,744
Hello. Sorry to bother you
on a Sunday...

93
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,999
...but I'm sure you're as worried about
the pollution in Lake Springfield as I am.

94
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,592
Lake Springfield has higher levels
of mercury than ev...

95
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,644
Why, it's the little girl
who saved my cat.

96
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,271
Lake Springfield is...

97
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,033
Come on over, Lisa.

98
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,120
You can canvass me
as long as you want.

99
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,831
Milhouse, you don't care
about the environment.

100
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,709
Hey. I am very passionate
about the planet.

101
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,210
Say global warming is a myth.

102
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,839
It's a myth! Further study is needed!

103
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,176
That's for selling out your beliefs.

104
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,345
Oh, poor Milhouse.

105
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,223
Dream coming true.

106
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,934
Are you aware that a leaky faucet
can waste over...?

107
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,603
Two thousand gallons a year.

108
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,522
- Turning off lights can save...
- Enough energy to power Pittsburgh.

109
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,900
And if we kept our thermostats
at 68 in winter...

110
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,236
We'd be free from our dependency
on foreign oil in 17 years.

111
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,946
I'm Colin.

112
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,781
I haven't seen you at school.

113
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,867
Moved from Ireland.
My dad's a musician.

114
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,660
- Is he...?
- He's not Bono.

115
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,289
- I just thought, because you're Irish and...
- He's not Bono.

116
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,916
Do you play?

117
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,168
Just piano, guitar, trumpet,
drums and bass.

118
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,839
He's pure gold.
For once in your life, be cool.

119
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,176
So is your name as pretty
as your face?

120
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,973
You okay there?

121
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:48,022
Twisted tail! A thousand eyes!
Trapped forever!

122
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,275
What could that be?

123
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,778
I believe it's the sound
the Green Lantern made...

124
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,031
...when Sinestro threw him
into a vat of acid.

125
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,537
Yeah. Thanks for coming over.

126
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,914
Thanks for giving me
your pregnancy pants.

127
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,500
Never known comfort like this.

128
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,381
Why did I suggest this?

129
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,686
All right, boy,
time for the ultimate dare.

130
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:33,401
I dare you to skateboard
to Krusty Burger and back...

131
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,444
...naked.

132
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,572
- How naked?
- Fourth base.

133
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,948
Girls might see my doodle.

134
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:44,120
Oh, I see. Then I hereby
declare you chicken for life.

135
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:48,291
Every morning, you'll wake up to
"Good morning, chicken."

136
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,293
At your wedding, I'll sing:

137
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,559
I like men now.

138
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,895
Don't look where I'm pointing!

139
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,501
Stop in the name of
American squeamishness!

140
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:44,138
Boys, before we eat, don't forget
to thank the Lord for this bountiful...

141
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,348
Penis?!

142
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,517
- Bountiful penis.
- Bountiful penis.

143
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,851
Amen.

144
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,981
Listen, kid, nobody likes wearing clothes
in public, but, you know, it's the law.

145
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,196
Lunchtime!

146
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,198
You can't just leave me out here.

147
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,826
Don't worry, we found
a friend for you to play with.

148
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,505
Nelson, honey, where have you been?

149
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,679
- Dad!
- What seems to be the problem, officers?

150
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,722
Tell him you dared me to do it.

151
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,686
If that's true, then you should be
taking the rap here, not your son.

152
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,566
And what happens to me
if it's my fault?

153
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,569
You'll have to attend
a one-hour parenting class.

154
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,363
It was all his idea!
He's out of control, I tell you!

155
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,781
I'm at my wits' end.

156
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,158
It's so...

157
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,537
See you in court, kid.

158
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,873
Okay, son, let's get some lunch.

159
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,749
Did you at least bring my clothes?

160
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,877
Shirt, socks, everything you need.

161
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,714
- You didn't bring my pants.
- Who am I, Tommy Bahama?

162
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,716
This is the worst day of my life.

163
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,969
The worst day of your life so far.

164
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,225
- Say, Bart?
- What do you want, Flanders?

165
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,145
If you need pants,
I carry an extra pair.

166
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,064
You know how boys are,
always praying through the knees.

167
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,525
Why are you helping me?
I'm not your kid.

168
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:23,696
We're neighbors. I'm sure your father
would do the same for my boys.

169
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,323
Thank you.

170
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,374
- Hey, what's with you?
- You really wanna know?

171
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,918
Of course I do.

172
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,587
What kind of a father
wouldn't care about...?

173
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,005
A pig wearing a hat!

174
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,382
Action.

175
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:48,554
Hey, hey! It's your old pal Krusty,
for my new pork sandwich, the Klogger.

176
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:53,684
If you can find a greasier sandwich,
you're in Mexico!

177
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,107
And we're clear.

178
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,193
Perfect. Cut, print, kill the pig.

179
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,365
What...?! You can't kill him
if he's wearing people clothes!

180
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,422
You're coming home with me.

181
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,012
"A thousand eyes."
What could that be?

182
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:35,017
I'm pretty sure
a thousand is a number.

183
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:39,981
Hey, Marge. Isn't it great being married
to someone who's recklessly impulsive?

184
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,191
Actually, it's aged me horribly.

185
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,319
Then say hello
to the newest Simpson.

186
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,869
Homer!

187
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:59,208
I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

188
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,460
Please, get rid of that pig.

189
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:06,632
Oh, you're gonna love him.
Look, he does an impression of you.

190
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,345
You nailed her.

191
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,473
He also does me.

192
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,685
You smiled. I'm off the hook.

193
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,780
Oh, you have so many looks.

194
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,716
So that's what snug is.

195
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,177
Who's a good pig?

196
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,055
Who's a good pig?

197
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,810
Rough day, huh, son?

198
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,397
You don't know what rough is, sister.

199
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,692
Bart, you know, whenever my boys
bake up a batch of frownies...

200
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,236
...I take them fishing.

201
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,613
Does your dad ever take you fishing?

202
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,370
Dad, it's not fair to use a bug zapper
to catch the fish.

203
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,082
If you love fish like I do,
you want them to die with dignity.

204
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,340
I think I have a nibble.

205
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,600
I think fishing might be
more fun with you.

206
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,603
Oh, great. Now, how about
I fix you some cocoa?

207
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,689
No way. Cocoa's for wusses.

208
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,775
Well, sir, if you change your mind,
it's on the windowsill.

209
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,547
Oh, my God.

210
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,385
Oh, wait. I didn't tell you the best part.
He loves the environment.

211
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:19,182
Oh, wait! I still didn't tell you
the best part. He's got an Irish brogue.

212
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,976
No, no, wait!
I still didn't tell you the best part.

213
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,978
He's not imaginary!

214
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,189
Oh, honey, that's great.

215
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:30,276
But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

216
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,779
Because nothing means more
than for a man to...

217
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,782
How did the pig tracks
get on the ceiling?

218
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,160
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig

219
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,829
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

220
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,290
Can he swing from a web?

221
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,542
No, he can 't, he's a pig

222
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,630
Look out
He is the Spider-Pig

223
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,094
Are we having fun yet?

224
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,055
We are now. You've got a bite.

225
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,599
Whoa, mama!

226
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,519
Oh, no, my good pole!

227
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,858
You're not strangling me.

228
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,486
What the...?
Strangling's only good for...

229
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,821
Well, it's not good for anything.

230
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,074
The only time you should
lay hands on a boy...

231
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,117
...is to give him
a good pat on the back.

232
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,245
Hey, what the hell are you...?

233
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,875
One more time.

234
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,850
Honey, I'm home.

235
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,482
We are at the tipping point, people.

236
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,484
If we don't do something now...

237
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,739
I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Isn't he dreamy?

238
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,074
Agreed.

239
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,784
Okay, so here's the bottom line:

240
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,078
If we don't change our ways
right now...

241
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:08,082
...pollution in Lake Springfield
will be at this level.

242
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,334
That's not so bad.

243
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,421
No, the lift is stuck.

244
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,846
Am I getting through to anyone?

245
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,599
Hell, yeah.
We need a new one of those things.

246
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,101
All in favor of a new scissor lift,
say "aye."

247
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,061
- Aye.
- No!

248
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:34,317
This lake is just one piece of trash
away from a toxic nightmare.

249
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,943
But I knew you wouldn't listen.

250
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,947
So I took the liberty of pouring water
from the lake in all your drinking glasses.

251
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,035
This is why we should hate kids.

252
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,703
This is serious, people.

253
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:50,291
No more dumping in the lake.
I hereby declare a state of emergency.

254
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,834
Code black.

255
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,714
Black? That's the worst color there is.

256
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,675
- No offense there, Carl.
- I get it all the time.

257
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,403
Sorry, sorry. No dumping in the lake.

258
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:25,451
Fine. I will put my yard trimmings
in a car compactor.

259
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,788
Chief, I think there was
a dead body in there.

260
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,250
I thought that too,
until he said "yard trimmings."

261
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,168
You gotta learn to listen, Lou.

262
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:38,714
Let us now make sure
this barrier is completely idiot-proof.

263
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,925
- Cletus.
- Yessum?

264
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,177
Try to dump something in the lake.

265
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,096
Okay.

266
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,898
I can't. I simply can't.

267
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,692
- Brilliant.
- Very effective.

268
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,331
Don't get any ideas.

269
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,755
Maybe we should kiss,
just to break the tension.

270
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,883
What's going on here?

271
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,176
Nothing. Nothing.

272
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,720
I'm not sure that pig
should be in the house.

273
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,932
And by the way,
what are you doing with his leavings?

274
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:33,936
Don't worry.
I've devised a most elegant solution.

275
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,607
It's leaking.

276
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:41,360
It's not leaking, it's overflowing.

277
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,531
He filled up the whole silo
in just two days?

278
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,741
Well, I helped.

279
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:52,246
Homer, stop! Stop. I know it's easy
for your mind to wander...

280
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:58,252
...but I want you to
really concentrate on me.

281
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:05,343
I can't escape the feeling that this
is the crisis Grampa warned us about.

282
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,721
You have to dispose
of that waste properly.

283
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,265
Okay, Marge. I will.

284
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,392
You can take Spider-Pig with you.

285
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,938
He's not Spider-Pig anymore,
he's Harry Plopper.

286
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,702
Hello.

287
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,287
Homer, you gotta get over here.

288
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:37,124
Health inspector shut down the doughnut
store, they're giving out free doughnuts!

289
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,294
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I just got one thing I gotta do first.

290
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,965
Well, you better hurry.
They're going fast.

291
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,801
Whoa, that was close.

292
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,469
Evil!

293
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,182
Drive, drive, drive!

294
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,267
Oh, right.

295
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:06,088
Look at that. You can see
the four states that border Springfield:

296
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:09,967
Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

297
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,511
Oh, yeah.

298
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:15,056
And if you look real close,
you can almost...

299
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,895
Well, this certainly seems odd...

300
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,815
...but who am I to question
the work of the Almighty?

301
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,154
We thank you, Lord,
for this mighty fine intelligent design.

302
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,240
Good job.

303
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,159
Jabbity, jabbity, jab, jab, jab!

304
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,537
Hey! Jab one more eye
and it's a federal crime.

305
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,541
- Who are you?
- Environmental Protection Agency.

306
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,927
Russ Cargill, head of the EPA,
here to see the president.

307
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,684
Mr. President.

308
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,353
Ja, that is me.

309
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:06,232
Pollution in Springfield
has reached crisis levels.

310
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:11,279
I hate this job. Everything's "crisis" this
and "end of the world" that.

311
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,323
Nobody opens with a joke.
I miss Danny De Vito.

312
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:18,202
You want a joke, huh?
Stop me if you've heard this one.

313
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:22,415
Look at those angry eyes
and giant teeth.

314
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,584
It's like Christmas
at the Kennedy compound.

315
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,879
You know, sir, when you
made me head of the EPA...

316
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,465
...you appointed one of
the most successful men in America...

317
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,843
...to the least successful agency
in government.

318
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,970
And why did I take the job?

319
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,890
Because I'm a rich man
who wanted to give something back.

320
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,641
Not the money, but something.

321
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:45,021
So here is our chance to
kick some ass for Mother Earth.

322
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,940
- I'm listening.
- Well, I've narrowed your choices down...

323
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,109
...to five unthinkable options.

324
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,903
Each will cause untold misery...

325
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,613
I pick number three.

326
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,406
You don't wanna read them first?

327
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:59,243
I was elected to lead, not to read.
Number three!

328
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,496
We're being sealed in a dome!

329
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,542
What do I do?
I don't know what to do!

330
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,877
If I stay, I'm trapped.
If I leave, I'm alone.

331
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,754
Oh, God. In, out, in, out!

332
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,047
I never saw Venice.

333
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,271
"Trapped forever."

334
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,815
It's all come true.

335
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,610
That crazy old man in church
was right.

336
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:23,744
Dome!

337
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,220
All right, men, open fire.

338
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,224
Who's hurt? Raise your hands.

339
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,227
Without the attitude.

340
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:51,022
People, people.
I have an important announcement.

341
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,442
I have just perfected
an acid-firing super-drill...

342
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,612
...which can cut through anything.
- Hey, that's cool.

343
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,988
It's right there.

344
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:02,909
Just outside of the dome.

345
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:08,122
What ruthless madmen
could have done this to us?

346
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,916
The United States government.

347
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,921
My name is Russ Cargill
and I'm head of the EPA.

348
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,423
The what?

349
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:20,092
- Environmental Protection Agency.
- Come again?

350
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,637
Look, I'm a man on a big TV.
Just listen.

351
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,431
- Springfield has become...
- Springfield!

352
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,142
- The most polluted city
in the history of the planet.

353
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:29,685
Drama queen!

354
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,979
To keep your poisons
from spreading...

355
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,273
... your government has sealed you
in this dome.

356
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,777
It's the last thing we wanted to do.

357
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,530
I own the company that makes
the dome, but that's beside the point.

358
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,448
You mean we're trapped like rats?

359
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:47,829
No, rats can 't be trapped this easily.
You're trapped like carrots.

360
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:53,376
Wait. We couldn't be more polluted.
Everyone stopped dumping in the lake.

361
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,753
Apparently someone
didn 't get the message.

362
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,632
Act natural.

363
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:03,344
Hey, buddy, sooner or later,
people are gonna discover this.

364
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:07,348
Don 't worry about that. We found
a way to take you off the map.

365
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,227
Coming up on your right:

366
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,062
Nothing.

367
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,440
This is Kent Brockman,
reporting to you on a crisis so serious...

368
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,693
...it has its own name
and theme music.

369
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,031
The dome has put an end
to life as we know it.

370
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,370
The town is running low on supplies of
everything from gasoline to Botox.

371
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,539
Moment, please.

372
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:39,046
Now, as always, we end our news
on "The Lighter Side."

373
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:42,675
It's the time of year when
the swallows return to Springfield.

374
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,232
I think the thing I miss most
is a simple summer breeze.

375
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,865
Maggie?

376
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,703
We've got dome wax, dome polish,
dome freshener, all your dome needs...

377
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,247
... at Dome Depot,
located at the 105 and the dome.

378
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,625
Dome Depot!

379
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,835
Maggie got out! Maggie got out!

380
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:24,133
Maggie was right there,
just outside the dome.

381
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:26,594
Marge, she's right here.

382
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:31,974
This dome can play tricks on you.
You just have to keep calm and...

383
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:33,392
Oh, my God.

384
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:38,272
I'm out of the dome.
Fresh air! Freedom!

385
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,858
I'll write you. Lead good lives!

386
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,793
Good evening, this is Kent Brockman.

387
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,712
Efforts to find out
whose selfish crime...

388
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,257
... caused our entrapment
have been fruitless.

389
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:06,342
Until moments ago!

390
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:10,930
A shocking discovery has been made
here at Lake Springfield.

391
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,100
That could be anybody's pig-crap silo.

392
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,858
Homer, it was you.

393
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:24,735
You single-handedly killed this town.

394
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,196
I know. It's weird.

395
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:30,825
Just a reminder, this station does not
endorse vigilante justice.

396
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,661
Unless it gets results. Which it will.

397
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:39,542
You didn't listen to me
after I warned you.

398
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,296
Don't worry,
nobody watches this stupid show.

399
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,715
What's that ominous glow
in the distance?

400
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,012
Kill! Kill! Kill!

401
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:03,608
Marge, look. Those idiots
don't even know where we live.

402
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,777
Kill! Kill! Kill!

403
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,948
We want Homer! We want Homer!

404
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:13,951
You monster. You monster!

405
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,578
Did you see the news?

406
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,705
Honey, come on,
we have bigger problems.

407
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:20,166
But I'm so angry.

408
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,836
You're a woman.
You can hold on to it forever.

409
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,714
Okay.

410
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:31,344
Homer, you have to go out there,
face that mob...

411
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,846
...and apologize for what you did.

412
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:37,308
I would, but I'm afraid if I open
the door, they'll take all of you.

413
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,519
No, we won't. We just want Homer!

414
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,938
Well, maybe not you,
but they'll kill Grampa.

415
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,856
I'm part of the mob!

416
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,528
Teeny! Take out the baby.

417
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,710
Here, let me get that for you.

418
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:14,136
Stay back. I got a chain saw.

419
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,482
Bart!

420
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:28,150
Crawl across. Hurry.

421
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,653
But if they see you helping us,
they'll kill you.

422
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:33,489
I'm sure your father would
do the same for...

423
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:37,118
Point taken. Now, hustle your bustles.

424
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,165
Archers.

425
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,376
I'm using a red arrow
so I know who I kill.

426
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,967
No, Plopper.
If you push that, Daddy will die.

427
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:01,267
Hey, my luck's beginning to turn.

428
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,647
Wait! There's something I have to get.

429
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:25,791
- What'd you get?
- Our wedding video.

430
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:29,504
- We have a wedding video?
- Torch his gas tank!

431
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,593
We lost them.

432
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,776
Up here.

433
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,195
Get them! Get them!

434
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,368
Little help?

435
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,708
You know, the word "apology"...

436
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:13,631
...is tossed around a lot these days,
but when it comes from in here...

437
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:28,062
Mom, what are we gonna do?

438
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:31,607
Maggie, not now.

439
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:34,485
We'll play later.

440
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,580
The sinkhole. Follow me, kids!

441
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:47,874
- Geronimo!
- Sacajawea!

442
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,798
So long, losers!

443
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:05,183
The top of his head is still showing.
Claw at it!

444
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:43,054
Well, they're China's problem now.

445
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:54,190
Colin!

446
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,157
I can't hear you!

447
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:27,723
I never thought my life would have an
absolutely perfect moment, but this is...

448
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:31,435
Lisa's got a boyfriend
that she'll never see again!

449
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,522
- Perfect.

450
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:48,870
- What do we do?
- Now we run.

451
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,375
I'm afraid we lost them, sir.

452
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:55,918
Damn it!

453
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:59,046
Well, then, you find them
and you get them back in the dome.

454
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:00,673
And so nobody else gets out...

455
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:03,551
...I want roving death squads
around the perimeter 24/7.

456
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,052
I want 10,000 tough guys...

457
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,472
...and I want 10,000 soft guys
to make the tough guys look tougher.

458
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:11,893
And here's how I want them arranged:
Tough, tough, soft, tough...

459
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:17,106
...soft, soft, tough, tough,
soft, soft, tough, soft.

460
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:20,651
Sir, I'm afraid you've
gone mad with power.

461
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,864
Of course. Ever try going mad without
power? It's boring. No one listens to you.

462
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,313
- Bart, are you drinking whiskey?
- I'm troubled.

463
00:39:57,522 --> 00:39:59,774
- Bart.
- I promise, I'll stop tomorrow.

464
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:02,401
You'll stop right now.

465
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:08,157
You come back here, little man.

466
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,540
I miss Flanders. There, I said it!

467
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,959
- Where's your father?
- He went out.

468
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,628
Let's quickly rebuild our lives
while he's gone.

469
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:22,463
Hey, guys?

470
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,466
What's the secret knock, again?

471
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:31,806
Look, I know I screwed up. This is big.

472
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,392
It's huge! We're homeless!

473
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,686
Our friends wanna kill us!

474
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:39,313
Before we can even stay
in the same room with you...

475
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,983
...I need to know what was
going through your mind...

476
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:44,485
...when you didn't listen to me...

477
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:48,197
...and dumped that silo in the lake.

478
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:49,657
Homer!

479
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:53,494
I don't know what to tell you, Marge.
I don't think about things.

480
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:55,830
I respect people who do...

481
00:40:56,038 --> 00:41:01,544
...but I just try to make the days not hurt
until I get to crawl in next to you again.

482
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,423
I mean, oh.

483
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:09,802
Look, I'm really sorry.
But I'm more than just sorry...

484
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,846
...I'm prepared with a solution.

485
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:16,642
I've always been afraid I'd screw up our
lives so badly we'd need a backup plan.

486
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:21,564
And that plan is right here!

487
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:24,734
No.

488
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:26,027
Nope.

489
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:27,862
Bingo.

490
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,867
Bear with me.

491
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:38,956
Alaska?

492
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:43,127
Alaska. A place where you can't be
too fat or too drunk.

493
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:45,004
Where no one says things like:

494
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:48,591
"Let's see your high school
equivalency certificate."

495
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,927
I don't know, Homie.

496
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,554
I'm not saying it right.

497
00:41:53,763 --> 00:41:57,475
Look, the thing is,
I can't start a new life alone.

498
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:00,436
And I've really come to like you guys.

499
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:04,857
I just don't see it.

500
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:12,573
Marge, in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

501
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:15,034
"I need you to do this with me."

502
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:20,998
And there's only one answer
when somebody says that.

503
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:29,757
Okay, Homie, I'm with you.

504
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:31,634
Thank you, my sweetheart.

505
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:34,011
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

506
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:36,472
You just bought
another load of crap...

507
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:39,725
...from the world's fattest
fertilizer salesman.

508
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,436
You'll pay for ruining
this golden family moment!

509
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:43,646
Homer!

510
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:47,150
How are we supposed to get to Alaska
without any money?

511
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,821
All right, son. If you don't believe in me,
believe in America.

512
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:58,578
America. Where any man can make
quick money with no questions asked.

513
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:03,249
Step right up and win my truck!

514
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:06,752
All you have to do is conquer
the Ball of Death.

515
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:08,337
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

516
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:12,466
Just ride the motorcycle
all the way around just one time.

517
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,760
Three tries for $ 10.

518
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:18,264
- Marge, how much money do we have?
- Ten dollars.

519
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,226
That counts as a try.

520
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:28,274
That's two.

521
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,819
And that's three.

522
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:34,780
Here's what I'll do,
because I like seeing you hurt yourself:

523
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:36,449
I'll give you one on the house.

524
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:38,493
- You're the best.
- Dad!

525
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:42,371
When you get to the top,
don't slow down, speed up!

526
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,541
- But that's when it's the scariest.
- Just do it!

527
00:43:57,678 --> 00:43:59,180
Yes!

528
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:03,184
Yay, Dad!

529
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:12,443
I'll take that truck now.

530
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:17,615
Oh, man. My wives are gonna kill me.

531
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:23,412
Next stop, Alaska!

532
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,212
Day 37 under the dome.

533
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,299
We are facing intermittent
power failures which...

534
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:41,681
Okay, very funny.
I'm gonna turn the lights off again.

535
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:44,976
When they come back on,
I want all my booze back the way it was.

536
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:52,733
Yeah, okay. Okay.

537
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:03,411
I'm very proud of you, Bart.
Over 24 hours sober.

538
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,913
- You are, aren't you?
- I'll prove it.

539
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:15,715
We're giving your father another chance,
and we owe it to him to...

540
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:18,593
- Oh, my God.
- Can I help you?

541
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:22,638
We need diapers.

542
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:25,057
- Okay.
- No. No, we don't. We don't.

543
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:27,185
- Ladies' razorblades.
- Right.

544
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:31,397
No! No. No, we don't.
I forgot, we're European.

545
00:45:31,939 --> 00:45:33,357
Just give us beef jerky.

546
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:36,319
Lots and lots of beef jerky.

547
00:45:36,527 --> 00:45:39,405
That's right. That's what we need.
That's all we came in for.

548
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:40,948
Sure.

549
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:46,496
Oh, my God. There they are!

550
00:46:06,098 --> 00:46:10,019
So you want some of my electricity,
do you?

551
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:14,607
Well, for once,
the rich white man is in control.

552
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:16,943
I have two buttons behind this desk.

553
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:21,781
One will supply your town with power,
the other releases the hounds.

554
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:24,784
Reach me. Make me your brother.

555
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:27,203
The hospital's generator
is about to give out.

556
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:28,663
Lives will be lost.

557
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:32,625
"Lives lost." Go on.

558
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:35,962
We got a convict we were gonna
fry tomorrow, but now we can't.

559
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,548
Tempting. Tempting.

560
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,466
Look, all our reasons mean nothing.

561
00:46:40,675 --> 00:46:44,387
Just look into your heart
and you'll find the answer.

562
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:50,685
- First door on the right.
- Thank you.

563
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:02,530
What...? This isn't the way
I pictured Alaska at all!

564
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:04,198
Oh, that's better.

565
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:06,159
Homer!

566
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:15,418
Well, at least my poster
didn't get torn.

567
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:29,807
Welcome to Alaska. Here's $ 1000.

568
00:47:30,016 --> 00:47:32,602
Well, it's about time! But why?

569
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,770
We pay every resident $ 1000...

570
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:37,899
...to allow oil companies to ravage
our state's natural beauty.

571
00:47:38,107 --> 00:47:40,193
I'm home!

572
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:42,278
Oh, thanks.

573
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:01,547
What are you doing, Bart?

574
00:48:01,756 --> 00:48:03,216
Just passing the time.

575
00:48:16,854 --> 00:48:20,441
My boy loves Alaska so much,
he's applauding it.

576
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,110
- Lisa, why aren't you clapping?
- But, Dad...

577
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:24,779
Clap for Alaska!

578
00:48:41,963 --> 00:48:46,342
Well, Marge, we're separated
from the kids by a wall of snow.

579
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:50,304
All my dreams are coming true.

580
00:49:21,377 --> 00:49:23,045
We're going to need more birds.

581
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,360
Day 93 under the dome.

582
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:48,863
With necessities growing
dangerously low...

583
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:52,033
...who knows what spark will set off
this powder keg?

584
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:55,661
- Let's discuss TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE.
- Again?

585
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:58,539
If we don't get a new book,
I'm going to puke.

586
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:02,418
You're the five people
I'm going to meet in hell!

587
00:50:04,378 --> 00:50:06,380
We're out of coffee!

588
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:11,761
I can't take another minute
in this dome!

589
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:24,482
Take that.

590
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:26,317
Oh, no! Blowback!

591
00:50:32,782 --> 00:50:34,450
Look what they're doing to our dome.

592
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,334
You know what that is, sir?

593
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:45,253
- A crack?
- Exactly.

594
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:48,631
People got out of the dome before,
they're gonna get out again.

595
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,676
When they do, there's gonna be
hearings, investigations...

596
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:55,638
I'll have to go back to
making family comedies.

597
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,684
Don't worry,
I have a solution for you, sir.

598
00:50:59,892 --> 00:51:02,436
In fact, I have five solutions.

599
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:05,106
You don't have to read them.
You'll have deniability.

600
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:07,108
I'll take care of it. You know nothing.

601
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:10,111
No. I need to know
what I'm approving.

602
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,240
Absolutely. But on the other hand,
knowing things is overrated.

603
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:16,784
Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is.

604
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:20,329
It takes real leadership to pick
something you're clueless about.

605
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:22,957
- Okay, I pick three.
- Try again.

606
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:24,959
- One. Five?
- Go higher. Too high.

607
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:26,294
- Three?
- You said three.

608
00:51:26,502 --> 00:51:28,296
- Six? Two?
- There is no six. Double it.

609
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:29,839
- Four!
- As you wish, sir.

610
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:46,063
Are you tired of
the same old Grand Canyon?

611
00:51:46,272 --> 00:51:49,150
Here we are, kids, the Grand Canyon.

612
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:53,696
It's so old and boring.
I want a new one. Now!

613
00:51:53,905 --> 00:51:56,032
Hello. I'm Tom Hanks.

614
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,534
The U.S. Government
has lost its credibility...

615
00:51:58,743 --> 00:52:00,411
...so it's borrowing some of mine.

616
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,996
Tousle my hair, Mr. Hanks.

617
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:04,165
Sure thing, son.

618
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:09,003
Now, I'm pleased to tell you all
about the New Grand Canyon.

619
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:12,715
This weekend. East of Shelbyville
and south of Capitol City.

620
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:14,800
That's where Springfield is!

621
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:17,386
It's nowhere near where
anything is or ever was.

622
00:52:17,595 --> 00:52:18,763
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

623
00:52:18,971 --> 00:52:21,974
If you're going to pick a government
to trust, why not this one?

624
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:23,518
Did you see that?

625
00:52:23,726 --> 00:52:26,437
Yes, they're going
to destroy Springfield.

626
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:28,397
But we're going to stop them.

627
00:52:28,606 --> 00:52:31,400
Homie, get your clothes on. Homie?

628
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:33,903
I'm happy here. Screw Springfield!

629
00:52:35,363 --> 00:52:38,407
I can't believe you'd say
something so selfish.

630
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:41,786
Marge, those people chased us
with pitchforks and torches.

631
00:52:41,994 --> 00:52:44,372
Torches! At 4 in the afternoon!

632
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,375
- It was 7 at night.
- It was during ACCESS HOLLYWOOD.

633
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,418
Which is on at 4 and 7.

634
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:53,464
Dad, how can you turn your back
on everyone who loved us?

635
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:55,466
Flanders helped
when we were in trouble.

636
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:57,718
Who cares what he did?
He's not your father.

637
00:52:57,927 --> 00:52:59,095
I wish he was.

638
00:52:59,303 --> 00:53:01,305
You don't mean that.
You worship me.

639
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:03,850
Oh, yeah?
Look what I did to your picture.

640
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:05,518
Look at it.

641
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:07,603
How-dilly-doo-dilly.
How-dilly-doo-dilly.

642
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:09,272
Why, you little...!

643
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:11,816
I'll strangle-angle you!

644
00:53:12,024 --> 00:53:13,317
Diddily-diddily.

645
00:53:13,526 --> 00:53:15,862
Bart, stop it! Leave this to me.

646
00:53:17,196 --> 00:53:18,948
Homer...

647
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:23,035
...in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

648
00:53:23,244 --> 00:53:26,330
"I need you to do this with me."

649
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:31,502
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

650
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:32,879
Homer Simpson!

651
00:53:33,087 --> 00:53:34,630
We're saving Springfield!

652
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:37,008
Listen to me, all of you.
We are staying.

653
00:53:37,216 --> 00:53:38,759
We have a great life in Alaska...

654
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:42,221
...and we're never going
back to America again.

655
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,390
I have spoken!

656
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:09,165
Well, I guess I've let her
worry about me long enough.

657
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:23,888
Marge? Kids?

658
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:39,111
Okay, here goes.

659
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,696
Homer...

660
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:42,865
... I've always stood up for you.

661
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:46,202
When people point out your flaws...

662
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:48,204
... I always say:

663
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:53,501
"Well, sometimes you have to
stand back to appreciate a work of art."

664
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:56,254
Way back.

665
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:59,715
Lately, what's keeping us together...

666
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:04,178
... is my ability to overlook
everything you do.

667
00:55:04,387 --> 00:55:08,140
And I overlook these things
because...

668
00:55:08,474 --> 00:55:09,725
Because?

669
00:55:10,726 --> 00:55:12,895
Well, that's the thing.

670
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:17,358
I just don 't know how to finish
that sentence anymore.

671
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:21,946
So I'm leaving with the kids
to help Springfield...

672
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:24,782
... and we're never coming back.

673
00:55:27,869 --> 00:55:31,539
And to prove to myself
that this is the end...

674
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:36,669
...I taped this over our wedding video.

675
00:55:37,962 --> 00:55:40,089
Goodbye, Homie.

676
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:56,230
I love you.

677
00:55:59,775 --> 00:56:02,236
Marge? Kids?

678
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:57,542
- So, Mom, what's our plan?
- What are you doing up there?

679
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,460
Looking through people's luggage.

680
00:56:59,669 --> 00:57:02,588
I'm the mascot of an evil corporation.

681
00:57:02,797 --> 00:57:06,300
Get down from there.
We have to keep a low profile...

682
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:10,596
...till we get to Seattle to tell the world
of the plot to destroy Springfield.

683
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:13,307
I don't know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

684
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:17,812
Oh, Lisa, it's not like the government
is listening to everybody's conversation.

685
00:57:26,154 --> 00:57:28,489
Hi, I'm calling about
your Meat Lover's pizza.

686
00:57:28,698 --> 00:57:31,826
I like meat, but I don 't know
if I'm ready to love again.

687
00:57:32,034 --> 00:57:35,288
- You hang up first.
- No, you hang up first.

688
00:57:35,496 --> 00:57:36,831
Okay.

689
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:38,875
She hung up on me!

690
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:43,421
But we're fugitives. We should
just lay low till we get to Seattle.

691
00:57:43,754 --> 00:57:45,506
Hey, everybody, I found one!

692
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:49,594
The government actually found
someone we're looking for!

693
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:51,637
Yeah, baby, yeah!

694
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:54,640
Homer Simpson...

695
00:57:56,601 --> 00:57:58,394
...do you know why you are here?

696
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:02,523
Because my family cares more about
other people than they do about me.

697
00:58:02,732 --> 00:58:05,109
Drink this liquid.

698
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,071
More, please.

699
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:11,949
Now we will cleanse your spirit...

700
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:15,369
...by the ancient Inuit art
of throat singing.

701
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:17,705
Throat singing?

702
00:58:28,257 --> 00:58:29,842
How long are we doing this?

703
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:30,468
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

704
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,804
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

705
00:58:37,266 --> 00:58:38,309
What's an epiphany?

706
00:58:38,518 --> 00:58:41,562
Sudden realization of great truth.

707
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:42,772
Okay.

708
00:58:57,328 --> 00:59:00,915
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig

709
00:59:01,123 --> 00:59:04,502
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

710
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:05,837
Look out!

711
00:59:06,295 --> 00:59:10,258
He's a Spider-Pig

712
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:13,928
Unless you have an epiphany...

713
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:18,057
...you will spend the remainder
of your days alone.

714
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:21,394
Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

715
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:25,565
Bananas are an excellent source
of potassium.

716
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:30,403
Americans will never embrace soccer?

717
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:35,449
More than two shakes
and it's playing with yourself?

718
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:40,288
Hey, what are you doing?

719
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:48,629
Oh, do whatever you want to me.
I don't care about myself anymore.

720
00:59:50,506 --> 00:59:52,800
Because...?

721
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:57,805
Because other people
are just as important as me.

722
00:59:58,181 --> 01:00:02,310
Without them, I'm nothing.

723
01:00:04,103 --> 01:00:07,482
In order to save myself...

724
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:10,234
...I have to save Springfield!

725
01:00:10,443 --> 01:00:13,321
That's it! Isn't it?

726
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:28,836
That was the most
incredible experience of my life.

727
01:00:29,045 --> 01:00:34,258
And now to find my family,
save my town and drop 10 pounds!

728
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:36,344
Thank you, boob lady.

729
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:47,188
This is it, kids. Seattle.

730
01:00:47,396 --> 01:00:50,399
Russ Cargill! Do you think he saw us?

731
01:00:54,153 --> 01:00:55,696
Yes, I did.

732
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:02,370
Run! Run!

733
01:01:02,954 --> 01:01:04,622
Run! Run!

734
01:01:05,122 --> 01:01:06,916
Run! Run!

735
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:09,585
Jump! Jump!

736
01:01:09,794 --> 01:01:11,796
Land! Land!

737
01:01:12,255 --> 01:01:14,215
Rest! Rest!

738
01:01:14,924 --> 01:01:16,300
Run! Run!

739
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,055
Now, I know we've had a rough day...

740
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:24,225
...but I'm sure we can put all that
behind us and...

741
01:01:27,311 --> 01:01:28,980
That's my whipping arm!

742
01:01:32,108 --> 01:01:35,778
Why does everything I whip leave me?

743
01:01:37,113 --> 01:01:41,242
Must keep going. Must keep going.

744
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:45,413
No, I can't. I can't keep going.

745
01:01:45,621 --> 01:01:47,707
Yes, you can.

746
01:01:47,915 --> 01:01:49,709
No, I can't!

747
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:51,586
Oh, shut up!

748
01:01:51,794 --> 01:01:53,379
You shut up.

749
01:01:53,588 --> 01:01:55,423
No, you. No, you.

750
01:01:55,631 --> 01:01:58,426
No, you. Oh, real mature.

751
01:01:58,634 --> 01:02:00,928
How could you say that?

752
01:02:01,137 --> 01:02:03,139
Oh, what's the point?

753
01:02:03,347 --> 01:02:05,683
It's hopeless.

754
01:02:13,649 --> 01:02:17,236
Don't give up, Homer.
You are closer than you think.

755
01:02:17,445 --> 01:02:19,071
But which way do I go?

756
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:26,287
Much obliged.

757
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:42,762
Ten-hut!

758
01:02:48,017 --> 01:02:50,186
Lisa! Knock off that racket.

759
01:02:50,394 --> 01:02:51,395
Lisa!

760
01:02:53,648 --> 01:02:57,318
They captured my family.
What do I do? What do I do?

761
01:03:03,533 --> 01:03:06,327
There's something strange
about that "sop" sign.

762
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,597
- Did you hear something?
- Probably just a moth.

763
01:03:26,806 --> 01:03:28,224
I hope it's okay.

764
01:03:52,498 --> 01:03:55,960
Look, we can't keep stopping at
every "sop," "yeld" or "one vay" sign.

765
01:03:56,169 --> 01:03:57,378
Just move on.

766
01:04:03,509 --> 01:04:05,178
Let us out! Let us out!

767
01:04:05,386 --> 01:04:07,555
Stop that.
You'll scratch your shackles.

768
01:04:07,763 --> 01:04:09,807
I hope I do.

769
01:04:16,105 --> 01:04:19,317
Oh, way to go, Bart.

770
01:04:19,525 --> 01:04:20,902
You stink.

771
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:24,864
No, you stink.

772
01:04:40,129 --> 01:04:41,881
Springfield.

773
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:44,550
I can't believe it,
but it got even crappier.

774
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:50,431
Oh, man.

775
01:05:00,149 --> 01:05:01,234
Oh, hi, Midge.

776
01:05:01,442 --> 01:05:03,528
Moe, what happened?

777
01:05:03,736 --> 01:05:08,199
With the town sealed off from the rest of
the world, things got a little nutty here.

778
01:05:08,407 --> 01:05:09,784
Why are you dressed like that?

779
01:05:09,992 --> 01:05:14,413
Well, I don't like to brag,
but I am now the emperor of Springfield.

780
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:15,957
No, you're not!

781
01:05:16,165 --> 01:05:18,459
Yes, I am!

782
01:05:19,669 --> 01:05:22,255
Okay. Hail, emperor.

783
01:05:22,463 --> 01:05:24,507
Attention, Springfield.

784
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:30,179
Your government realized that putting you
inside this dome was a terrible mistake.

785
01:05:30,388 --> 01:05:33,724
Therefore, we're commencing with
Operation Soaring Eagle.

786
01:05:35,434 --> 01:05:36,978
Which involves killing you all.

787
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:49,198
As I speak, we're lowering a small
but powerful bomb into your midst.

788
01:05:58,207 --> 01:06:02,170
Despite everything, I miss your father.

789
01:06:02,378 --> 01:06:04,046
Me too.

790
01:06:04,255 --> 01:06:06,924
His big, fat ass could shield us all.

791
01:06:11,512 --> 01:06:12,513
Ten-hut!

792
01:06:14,056 --> 01:06:17,602
At ease. I'm General Marriott Suites...

793
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:20,188
...and I have an urgent note
from the president.

794
01:06:20,396 --> 01:06:22,773
It says to release
this town immediately.

795
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:24,567
Why is it written on a leaf?

796
01:06:47,006 --> 01:06:48,007
Perfect.

797
01:06:50,468 --> 01:06:55,431
Now Homer Simpson's gonna show
he has cojones!

798
01:07:12,949 --> 01:07:14,909
Mom, I've gotta go find Colin.

799
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:19,372
Not now, sweetie.
Doomsday is family time.

800
01:07:24,293 --> 01:07:28,840
Hey. If one of us distracts Cargill,
the rest of us can climb up that thing.

801
01:07:29,048 --> 01:07:32,844
Who'd be dumb enough to stay behind
while we escape with our lives?

802
01:07:33,553 --> 01:07:35,721
My time to shine.

803
01:07:36,264 --> 01:07:39,475
Hey, Mr. Big TV Man, lookie here!

804
01:07:39,892 --> 01:07:41,394
What do you want?

805
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:45,773
Look what I can do with my thumb.

806
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:48,568
You wanna know how I do it?

807
01:07:48,776 --> 01:07:51,070
Four generations of inbreeding?

808
01:08:06,669 --> 01:08:08,379
I can smell fresh air.

809
01:08:09,338 --> 01:08:11,382
I can hear birds.

810
01:08:11,591 --> 01:08:13,885
I taste freedom.

811
01:08:14,093 --> 01:08:16,220
Excuse me!
Watch out! Coming through!

812
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:25,605
I was tricked by an idiot.

813
01:08:25,813 --> 01:08:31,444
Hey, I know how you feel.
I was beat in tic-tac-toe by a chicken.

814
01:08:31,652 --> 01:08:33,112
Goodbye.

815
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:37,241
Homer do good?

816
01:08:37,658 --> 01:08:42,580
Actually, you doomed us all. Again.
Nice knowing you, Homer.

817
01:08:42,788 --> 01:08:44,165
But I...

818
01:08:47,251 --> 01:08:49,879
I can't do anything right.

819
01:08:52,882 --> 01:08:55,051
Get out of here!

820
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,312
I've spent my entire life doing nothing
but collecting comic books.

821
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:09,190
And now there's only time to say:

822
01:09:09,398 --> 01:09:11,234
Life well spent!

823
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:20,952
Okay, boys. When you meet Jesus,
be sure to call him Mr. Christ.

824
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,954
Will Buddha be there too?

825
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:24,247
No.

826
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,374
- Hey, Flanders.
- Bart.

827
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:30,628
How good to see you.
And how terrible you're here.

828
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,547
Thanks.

829
01:09:32,755 --> 01:09:37,218
Listen. I was just wondering if...

830
01:09:37,426 --> 01:09:39,554
...before I died...

831
01:09:39,762 --> 01:09:43,641
...I could pretend I had a father who...

832
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,268
...cared for me.

833
01:09:46,602 --> 01:09:48,146
Come here, son.

834
01:09:48,354 --> 01:09:51,649
There's always room for one more
in the Flanders clan.

835
01:09:56,362 --> 01:09:59,740
Come on, bomb-disarming robot.
You're our last hope.

836
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:04,453
Red wire. Blue wire.
Black is usually the ground.

837
01:10:05,621 --> 01:10:07,331
So much pressure.

838
01:10:08,499 --> 01:10:09,750
Pressure!

839
01:10:13,754 --> 01:10:16,883
He'd been talking about it,
but I didn't take him seriously.

840
01:10:22,972 --> 01:10:24,140
Marge.

841
01:10:24,348 --> 01:10:26,601
Marge! Marge!

842
01:10:27,768 --> 01:10:29,729
Oh, no, the "epipha-tree"!

843
01:10:29,937 --> 01:10:33,733
Hey, I tried my best.
What am I supposed to do?

844
01:10:34,984 --> 01:10:38,237
But how am I
supposed to get up there?

845
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:45,953
Here. Buy yourself something nice.

846
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:53,294
Homer? What the hell
are you doing now?

847
01:10:53,503 --> 01:10:55,338
Risking my life to save people I hate...

848
01:10:55,546 --> 01:10:58,174
...for reasons I don't quite understand.
Gotta go!

849
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:01,636
But first, one stop.

850
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:11,229
Bart? Son?

851
01:11:11,437 --> 01:11:13,439
You think you could find it
in your heart...

852
01:11:13,648 --> 01:11:16,275
...to give your foolish old man
one more chance?

853
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:19,445
Oh, I don't know.

854
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:22,198
It seems to me, son,
that your father's saying that...

855
01:11:22,406 --> 01:11:25,660
...he wants to spend
his last minute with you.

856
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,289
No. I can't do it.

857
01:11:30,706 --> 01:11:34,669
I want a father who's the same
in the morning as he is at night.

858
01:11:34,877 --> 01:11:36,170
What's that word?

859
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:37,672
- Consistency.
- Consistency.

860
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,340
Thanks, losers.

861
01:11:39,549 --> 01:11:40,675
Sorry, Homer.

862
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:44,512
I'll let you hold the bomb.

863
01:11:45,847 --> 01:11:47,348
The man knows me.

864
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:54,147
I wish Homer was my father.

865
01:11:54,355 --> 01:11:57,316
And I wish you didn't have
the devil's curly hair.

866
01:12:05,408 --> 01:12:10,371
I've been taking your crap all my life!

867
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,544
This feels good. No wonder you do it.

868
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:23,801
Okay, you've only got one shot
to throw that bomb through the hole.

869
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:26,345
Dad, in case I miss...

870
01:12:26,554 --> 01:12:29,223
...I'm sorry I said I wished
you weren't my father.

871
01:12:29,432 --> 01:12:32,602
I don't blame you, son.
I wasn't much of a father.

872
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:35,480
Maybe it starts with the way
my dad raised me.

873
01:12:35,688 --> 01:12:40,067
Yes. It's clear to me. It's just been
one long, unbroken cycle of...

874
01:12:40,276 --> 01:12:42,945
Somebody throw the goddamn bomb!

875
01:13:05,176 --> 01:13:07,178
What? What's going on?

876
01:13:31,702 --> 01:13:32,995
We did it, boy!

877
01:13:33,371 --> 01:13:34,872
Dad?

878
01:14:25,089 --> 01:14:27,884
It's amazing no one was hurt.

879
01:14:28,676 --> 01:14:31,554
Bye, everybody.

880
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:37,185
Now, that was
a great father-son activity.

881
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:39,687
Hello, Homer.

882
01:14:40,521 --> 01:14:44,233
So we meet at last, whoever you are.

883
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:47,487
There's two things they don't teach you
at Harvard Business School.

884
01:14:47,695 --> 01:14:50,406
How to cope with defeat,
and how to handle a shotgun.

885
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:53,117
I'm going to do both right now.

886
01:14:53,326 --> 01:14:55,495
Wait! If you kill my dad...

887
01:14:55,703 --> 01:14:57,955
...you'll never know
where the treasure is buried.

888
01:14:58,164 --> 01:14:59,207
What treasure?

889
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:02,251
The Treasure of Imawiener.

890
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,544
I'm a wiener?

891
01:15:05,463 --> 01:15:06,464
Classic.

892
01:15:06,672 --> 01:15:08,841
Well, always leave them laughing.

893
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,468
Goodbye, sir.

894
01:15:17,683 --> 01:15:22,438
Maggie! What a great little accident
you turned out to be.

895
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:28,194
Colin? Colin!

896
01:15:28,653 --> 01:15:31,447
Lisa? Colin's dead.

897
01:15:33,032 --> 01:15:35,159
But his last words were:

898
01:15:35,368 --> 01:15:40,998
"Milhouse, take care of Lisa.
Hold her hand."

899
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:46,254
I got her all warmed up for you.

900
01:15:46,462 --> 01:15:48,756
Colin. Hi.

901
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:51,092
- Hey, you wanna go...?
- Clean up the lake?

902
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,970
Well, I was gonna say
get some ice cream, but okay.

903
01:15:54,929 --> 01:15:56,722
I like ice cream.

904
01:16:03,062 --> 01:16:05,106
Kind of sweaty. Sorry.

905
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:22,540
Boy! You survived! How?

906
01:16:22,748 --> 01:16:24,584
I did things no dog should do.

907
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:26,752
They will haunt me forever.

908
01:16:27,211 --> 01:16:28,379
I love you too.

909
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:46,939
Best kiss of my life.

910
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:49,901
Best kiss of your life so far.

911
01:17:08,461 --> 01:17:09,670
Steady.

912
01:17:10,546 --> 01:17:12,882
Steady.

913
01:17:14,175 --> 01:17:16,344
Steady.

914
01:17:16,552 --> 01:17:17,970
Dad?

915
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:20,640
Thanks, boy.

916
01:17:20,848 --> 01:17:23,309
Steady.

917
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:13,067
They've taken everything, sir.

918
01:18:15,611 --> 01:18:19,365
Smithers, I don't believe in suicide...

919
01:18:19,574 --> 01:18:23,119
...but if you'd like to try it,
it might cheer me up to watch.

920
01:18:57,737 --> 01:18:58,988
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

921
01:18:59,197 --> 01:19:02,074
If you see me in person,
please, leave me be.

922
01:19:15,129 --> 01:19:18,925
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig

923
01:19:19,467 --> 01:19:23,262
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

924
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,767
Can he swing from a web?

925
01:19:27,975 --> 01:19:31,270
No, he can 't, he's a pig

926
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:32,772
Look out!

927
01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:37,026
He is a Spider-Pig

928
01:19:39,821 --> 01:19:41,113
Look out!

929
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:45,493
He is a Spider-Pig

930
01:20:14,272 --> 01:20:18,234
Come on, Dad, let's go. I've been holding
it since they put the dome over the town.

931
01:20:18,442 --> 01:20:21,529
You can wait. A lot of people
worked really hard on this film...

932
01:20:21,737 --> 01:20:25,867
...and all they ask is for you
to memorize their names.

933
01:20:26,075 --> 01:20:28,494
Well, I wanna make sure
no animals were harmed...

934
01:20:28,703 --> 01:20:31,664
...during the filming of this movie.

935
01:20:35,418 --> 01:20:36,419
Okay.

936
01:20:37,295 --> 01:20:39,589
Floor popcorn.

937
01:20:41,674 --> 01:20:44,510
Wait, wait, wait! It looks like
Maggie has something to say.

938
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,513
Oh, my God. Her first word.

939
01:20:48,264 --> 01:20:50,183
Sequel?

940
01:24:28,901 --> 01:24:32,280
Springfield doesn 't have an anthem

941
01:24:32,488 --> 01:24:36,409
We thought we had one
But we don 't

942
01:24:36,617 --> 01:24:40,454
We paid a short guy to write it

943
01:24:40,663 --> 01:24:44,458
But we never saw him again

944
01:24:44,667 --> 01:24:48,462
The tune we stole from the French

945
01:24:48,671 --> 01:24:52,049
There's a few things they do well

946
01:24:52,258 --> 01:24:56,304
Like making love, wine and cheese

947
01:24:56,512 --> 01:25:00,475
Like Roqueforts, Camemberts and Bries

948
01:25:00,683 --> 01:25:04,479
Springfield, we're going to die

949
01:25:04,687 --> 01:25:09,442
Springfield, I'm scared, goodbye

950
01:26:20,221 --> 01:26:24,308
Assistant manager
