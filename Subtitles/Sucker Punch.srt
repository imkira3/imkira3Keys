where the guards are located.

...as a distraction for when we escape.

Plus, the fire should disable
all the checkpoints.

-I'm not doing this.

975
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:07,109
Guys, don't do this to me now, please.

976
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:09,027
I need her in that chair.

977
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:13,702
Put her in the goddamn chair!

978
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,377
Thank you.

979
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:23,921
Close the door, please.

980
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:33,851
What? What is it, you're not here? Huh?

981
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:37,981
You're not here, you're in paradise?
No, no, no. No, no, no.

982
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:39,857
No,no,no.

983
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,403
You're still here.

984
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:46,902
You're here with me.

985
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:50,409
In all this shit.

986
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,413
And you don't go away unless I say so.

987
01:39:55,156 --> 01:39:56,578
Okay?

988
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:12,094
That's not right.

989
01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:14,516
That's not right.

990
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,265
You come back to me.

991
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:20,227
[DOOR OPENS]

992
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:23,188
-Stop right there. Move away from the girl.
GORSKI: What are you doing?

993
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:26,525
Aah! Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Aah!

994
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,735
What in God's name
have you been doing up here?

995
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:31,526
I wasn't doing anything. Look at her.

996
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:34,115
She's gone. Look at her face!
She's not here.

997
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:37,327
What do you think I wanna do?
I take care of these girls.

998
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:40,084
I look out for them.
These are my girls. Tell them.

999
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,791
Tell them!

1000
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:44,331
Get him out of here.

1001
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:48,047
-Now.
-Aah! Wait.. Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

1002
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:50,462
It's not me you want, it's her stepfather.

1003
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:54,303
I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you--
I'll tell you about the money.

1004
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:56,930
COP:
Just keep going down the hall.

1005
01:40:58,135 --> 01:40:59,887
You all right, miss?

1006
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,568
Miss?

1007
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,450
SWEET PEA:
And finally, this question:

1008
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:24,162
The mystery of whose story it will be...

1009
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:27,131
...of who draws the curtain.

1010
01:41:27,957 --> 01:41:31,461
Who is it that chooses our steps
in the dance?

1011
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:34,548
Who drives us mad...

1012
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:36,508
...lashes us with whips...

1013
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:40,770
...and crowns us with victory
when we survive the impossible?

1014
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,181
Who is it...

1015
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:46,851
...that does all these things?

1016
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:51,697
WOMAN [OVER PA]: Bus 22 southbound
to Fort Wayne will now begin loading.

1017
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:54,985
Please have your tickets ready
to show the driver.

1018
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:11,042
TROOPER:
Excuse me, miss?

1019
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,139
Miss, can we have a word?

1020
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:19,725
WISE MAN:
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

1021
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:22,728
This doesn't concern you.
I have questions for the lady.

1022
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:25,731
Well, could you make it snappy?
I need to stay on schedule.

1023
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,733
-We understand.
-Do you?

1024
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:30,395
That young woman's been on this bus
since Hartford.

1025
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:34,782
I don't see what she could possibly know
about anything happening around here.

1026
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,112
Is that true, miss?

1027
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:40,155
I just let her off to use the restroom.
Mine's not working.

1028
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:47,253
-All right.
WISE MAN: Oh, and one more thing.

1029
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:51,633
-She's been a joy the entire journey.
-Yes, I said, all right.

1030
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:57,589
Sorry about the inconvenience, miss.
You have yourself a nice trip now.

1031
01:42:57,755 --> 01:42:59,098
It's no problem.

1032
01:43:09,058 --> 01:43:12,608
-I don't have a ticket.
-I know. it's okay.

1033
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:16,274
Go find a seat in the back.
Try and get some sleep.

1034
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:19,364
We got a long way to go.

1035
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:22,120
Thank you.

1036
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:34,050
SWEET PEA: Who honors those we love
with the very life we live?

1037
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:37,795
Who sends monsters to kill us...

1038
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:41,800
...and at the same time
sings that we'll never die?

1039
01:43:42,842 --> 01:43:47,814
Who teaches us what's real
and how to laugh at lies?

1040
01:43:48,723 --> 01:43:52,819
Who decides why we live
and what we'll die to defend?

1041
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:55,479
Who chains us?

1042
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:59,150
And who holds the key
that can set us free?

1043
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:02,573
It's you.

1044
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:05,828
You have all the weapons you need.

1045
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:07,333
Now fight.

1046
