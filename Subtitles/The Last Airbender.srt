00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,289
A hundred years ago,
all was right with our world.

3
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,375
Prosperity and peace filled our days.

4
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,043
The Four Nations:

5
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:32,008
Water, Earth, Fire and Air Nomads
lived amongst each other in harmony.

6
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:36,888
Great respect was afforded to all those
who could bend their natural element.

7
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:41,017
The Avatar was the only person
born amongst all the nations

8
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,895
who could master all four elements.

9
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,982
He was the only one who could
communicate with the Spirit World.

10
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,695
With the Spirits' guidance,
the Avatar kept balance in the world.

11
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,408
And then, a hundred years ago,
he just disappeared.

12
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,030
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

13
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,115
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

14
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:42,245
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey!
It worked better that time.

15
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,873
I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?

16
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,127
Yeah. I guess so.

17
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,757
Just stop doing that stuff around me.
I always get wet.

18
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,305
My brother and I live
in the Southern Water Tribe,

19
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:06,102
which was once a big city.
Our father is off fighting in The War.

20
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,564
My mother was taken prisoner
and killed when I was young.

21
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,651
In this time of war, food is scarce.

22
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,945
My brother and I often
go hunting for food,

23
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:20,324
but, unfortunately, my brother
isn't the best hunter in the world.

24
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,164
- Tiger seal.
- Are you sure?

25
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,481
I did everything Dad said to do.

26
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,984
I watched which side of the fin tracks
are more indented.

27
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,611
That shows which
direction they're going.

28
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,489
I saw how long the drag skids are.
That shows you how fast they're going.

29
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,499
There's something under there.

30
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,225
It's a cave-in!
Move away from the cracks!

31
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,967
Katara, don't go near it.
This is probably some Fire Nation trick.

32
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,762
Just back away really slow.

33
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,937
Katara! Do not hit that sphere!

34
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,662
Uncle, look!

35
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,620
Is he breathing?

36
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,460
Did you see that light
shoot into the sky?

37
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,295
What's your name?

38
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,341
How did you get here?
How did you get in the ice?

39
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,844
He's exhausted.

40
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,347
We need to get him back to the village.

41
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,439
What is this thing?

42
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,112
It's trying to eat me!

43
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,997
Look. See?

44
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,135
How'd you get all the way out here?

45
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,304
I ran away from home.

46
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,391
We got in a storm. We were forced
under the water of the ocean.

47
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,268
I see.

48
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,146
It wasn't very smart. I was just upset.

49
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,066
- Thanks for saving me.
- Lucky.

50
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,611
I probably should get home.
They'll all be worried.

51
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,906
- You're not still upset?
- Not as much as I was.

52
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,883
The Fire Nation is here.

53
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,885
- What?
- And they brought their machines.

54
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,431
Don't come out
till I tell you it's safe.

55
00:07:56,226 --> 00:08:00,187
- Is something wrong?
- No. Please wait here.

56
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,858
- Hurry, now!
- Secure the area!

57
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,746
It can't be coincidence
that we break him out of the ice,

58
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,458
light shoots into the sky and now the
Fire Nation is here with their machines.

59
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,805
Sokka, don't.

60
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,900
I am Prince Zuko...

61
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,654
...son of Fire Lord Ozai
and heir to the throne!

62
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,950
Bring me all your elderly!

63
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,911
- Papa!
- Move!

64
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,120
Yeah?

65
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,334
Grandma!

66
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,674
Please don't... don't harm him!

67
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,344
Come on!

68
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,683
Katara, don't.

69
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,937
- Form a line!
- Come on!

70
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,400
Here.

71
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,486
Hey.

72
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,834
Grammy!

73
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,630
You're scaring these people.

74
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,515
Who are you? What's your name?!

75
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,726
- I don't need to tell you anything.
- Firebenders!

76
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,733
I'm taking you to my ship.

77
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:14,071
If you don't come,
I'll burn down this village.

78
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,200
I'll go with you.
Don't hurt anyone.

79
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,176
They were looking for someone old
and they were looking for someone

80
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,012
with the same markings the boy had.

81
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,390
They dragged Mom away
the same way when we were babies.

82
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,893
She wouldn't have watched us being
taken away. She would have fought.

83
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,564
We found that boy. He's our
responsibility. We should fight.

84
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,443
What would you do
if they tried to take me away?

85
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,111
I'd kill them all.

86
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,240
- Why?
- Because you're my sister.

87
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,577
Because Dad told me
to protect you with my life.

88
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:08,667
Because I'm your responsibility.
And this boy is our responsibility.

89
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,175
What do you want us to do, Katara?
How are we supposed to save him?

90
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,719
They're on a ship.
We'd need a miracle to catch them.

91
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,889
I know you think everything's
going to work out, but I don't.

92
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,823
His bison creature thing floats.

93
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,762
What do you want with me?

94
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,517
My nephew wants me to perform
a little test on you.

95
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,980
- What kind of test?
- I assure you, it won't hurt.

96
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,609
I've performed it hundreds of times.
It only takes a few moments.

97
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,319
And then you're free to go.

98
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,241
Would you mind if I put a few things
in front of you at the table?

99
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,868
It will only take a moment.

100
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,413
That's all you want?

101
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,791
My name is Iroh,
and you have my word.

102
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,503
Grandma, I know
you're gonna try to stop us,

103
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,464
- but this is just something I need...
- Sit down.

104
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,137
I knew from the first time
we discovered you were a Bender,

105
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,223
that one day,
I would realize your destiny.

106
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,854
There hasn't been a Waterbender
in the Southern Water Tribe

107
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,940
since my friend Hama was taken away.

108
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:00,237
Today, I found out that destiny.

109
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,906
Did you see that boy's tattoos?

110
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:07,244
Tattoos like that haven't
been seen in over a century.

111
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,874
I believe they are Airbending tattoos.

112
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,042
How can that be?

113
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,256
I believe that little boy
might be the Avatar.

114
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:27,598
Once, a long time ago,
the Spirit World kept balance over us.

115
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,766
What is the Spirit World, Grandma?

116
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,936
It's not a place made up
of things you can touch.

117
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,856
But it exists, nonetheless.

118
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:41,945
It is filled with the most amazing forms
of dazzling creatures...

119
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:48,076
...that exist in the most
exotic valleys, mountains and forests.

120
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,706
Each of these creatures is a Spirit.

121
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,375
They've watched over us
since the beginning.

122
00:13:55,543 --> 00:14:00,172
They have guided us. And only
the Avatar can go speak to them.

123
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,090
Aren't there Spirits here?

124
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,094
Yes, there are some Spirits
that live hidden among us,

125
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,556
sure they're watching us
with great sadness...

126
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,687
The Fire Nation doesn't wish
to live by the Spirits.

127
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,316
That's why they're so frightened
by the existence of the Avatar.

128
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,278
- What can he do?
- With his mastery of the four elements,

129
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,324
he will begin to change hearts.

130
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:32,663
And it is in the heart
that all wars are won.

131
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,502
Now, go help this boy.

132
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,588
He will need you two.

133
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,842
And we all need him.

134
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,325
You are my prisoner...

135
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,077
...Airbender.

136
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,914
I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.

137
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,751
- You said...
- I apologize.

138
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,836
I should have explained further.

139
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:07,883
If you failed the test, as all others
did, you were free to leave.

140
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:13,013
But, as it turns out, you are
the only one in the entire world

141
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,057
who could pass this test.

142
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,685
It is truly an honor
to be in your presence.

143
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,273
Don't even try to escape.
This is a warship!

144
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,780
Stop! There's no way you can...

145
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,154
Don't move! You have nowhere to run!

146
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,447
Halt!

147
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,574
Don't let him escape!

148
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,992
Get him!

149
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,142
Thanks for bringing Appa to me.

150
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,311
The Fire Nation is up to something.
I have to go back now.

151
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,606
- We'll come with you.
- I can take you back to the village.

152
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,860
We're going with you.

153
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,115
You found the Avatar.

154
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:00,287
For a moment, I had my honor back.

155
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:07,127
Your destinies are tied, Zuko.
That, you can be sure of.

156
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,053
Aang flew us to his home. He told us
how he left there in a storm on Appa,

157
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,265
and got forced into the ocean
where they almost drowned.

158
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,018
Aang Airbended a sphere around them,
and ice formed.

159
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,645
And he couldn't remember
anything after that.

160
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,149
Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back!

161
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,569
Hey, guys! I want you to meet someone!

162
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,113
This is where you live?

163
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,449
They must be playing some trick
or something.

164
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,494
Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out
and scare me at any moment.

165
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,871
He's the teacher responsible for me.

166
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,083
He's kind of like my father.

167
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,171
- Is it OK if you tell me your name?
- The monks named me Aang.

168
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,842
OK, guys! Enough!

169
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,014
Spider-rat!
They're poisonous! Get behind me.

170
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,851
He's a flying lemur-bat.
We keep them as pets.

171
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,686
Weren't they extinct a long time ago?

172
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,107
Extinct? No, there must be thousands
of them on this mountain.

173
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,821
Your friends were monks?

174
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,824
I know where they are right now.
They're at the prayer field!

175
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,206
Aang, wait! I have to talk to you!

176
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,218
Aang...

177
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,057
...I think you were in that ice
for almost a hundred years.

178
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:51,356
- The Firebenders started a war.
- I left a few days ago.

179
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:57,070
Aang, the Fire Nation knew the Avatar
would be born into the Air Nomads...

180
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,907
...so they exterminated
all the Air Nomads.

181
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,588
You're lying!

182
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,976
This is Monk Gyatso's.

183
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,604
I made it for him.

184
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,995
No!

185
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,222
Katara! Stay away from him!

186
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,311
Katara!

187
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,229
Stay away from him!

188
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,527
Your friends were monks?

189
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,725
The Avatar?

190
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,021
Where have you been?

191
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,523
Aang!

192
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,442
You can't bring Monk Gyatso back,

193
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,279
but Sokka and I can be with you
as long as you need!

194
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:07,409
Don't give up! We can do this together!

195
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,036
Aang!

196
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,741
The banished prince.

197
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,245
Let's offer him lunch.

198
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,960
I wanted to thank
the great General Iroh

199
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,380
and young Prince Zuko
for dining with us.

200
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:09,596
As you know, the Fire Lord
has banished his son, the Prince,

201
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,891
and renounced his love of him, and will
not let him return to the throne

202
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,768
unless he finds the Avatar.

203
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,064
The Fire Lord believes his son
is too soft,

204
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,108
and by doing this,
he will become strong

205
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,278
and become a worthy heir
to the throne.

206
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,115
I commend the Fire Lord's discipline.

207
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:33,244
For example, it seems
I need to remind Prince Zuko

208
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,749
that, during his banishment,
he is an enemy of the Fire Nation

209
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,044
and is not allowed
to wear the Fire Nation uniform.

210
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,006
But we will let him wear it today,

211
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,383
like a child wearing a costume.

212
00:23:55,476 --> 00:24:00,313
One day, my father will take me back
and you will bow before me.

213
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,262
You OK?

214
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,390
I'll be fine.

215
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,352
You know, my grandma thinks
because you're an Airbender,

216
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,896
that you could be the Avatar.

217
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,901
How much does
the Fire Nation control?

218
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,988
A lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom,
like around here.

219
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,408
They haven't been able to conquer
big cities, like Ba Sing Se,

220
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,744
but they're making plans, I'm sure.

221
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,413
So...

222
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,499
...are you the Avatar, Aang?

223
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,591
What is this?

224
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:53,968
Stay hidden.

225
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,353
- That child is being arrested.
- For what?

226
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,815
He was bending tiny stones at us
from behind a tree. It really hurt.

227
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,234
He can bend earth?

228
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,695
Earthbending is forbidden
in this village.

229
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:17,283
Leave him alone.
You're not taking him anywhere.

230
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,162
No one is taking anybody away!

231
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:25,750
She's a bender!

232
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:32,966
Katara!

233
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:56,990
Move.

234
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:58,950
You, too.

235
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,118
Dad!

236
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,874
- This is my father.
- Hello.

237
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,837
That's the Fire Nation's plan,
suppress all other bending.

238
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,341
How did this happen to your village?

239
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:21,180
Fire Nation sent soldiers.
We fought them and defeated them.

240
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:27,186
Then they sent their machines,
huge machines made of metal.

241
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,355
There was nothing we could do.

242
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,901
Those who could not bend were
allowed to live in peace,

243
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,695
if we were imprisoned.

244
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,042
Earthbenders!

245
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:57,842
Why are you acting this way?
You are powerful and amazing people!

246
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,388
You don't need to live like this!
There is earth right beneath your feet.

247
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,226
The ground is an extension
of who you are!

248
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,398
If the Avatar had returned...

249
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,735
...would that mean anything to you?

250
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:20,823
The Avatar is dead.
If he was here, he would protect us.

251
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,077
My name is Aang...

252
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,080
...and I am the Avatar.

253
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,751
I ran away, but I'm back now.

254
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,757
It's time for you to stop doing this!

255
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:43,429
The Avatar would have to be an
Airbender. Are you an Airbender, boy?

256
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,934
Leave him alone!

257
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,109
How is he doing that?

258
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,319
I don't want to hurt anyone.

259
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:02,490
All Airbenders should be dead.
Kill him! Firebenders, positions!

260
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,956
OK! Everybody can help us now!

261
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,148
Don't be afraid!

262
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,353
Just leave them!

263
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,772
Fall back!

264
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,859
Go! He's an Airbender!

265
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:43,966
They took away any tools
related to bending.

266
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:01,484
The Fire Nation took this scroll
from a member of your Water Tribe.

267
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,238
A Waterbending scroll.

268
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,621
This is rare.
My mom told me about these.

269
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,960
This was you when
you were born an Earthbender,

270
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,546
two lifetimes ago.

271
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,130
You came to our village.

272
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:28,302
Avatar Kyoshi loved games.

273
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,889
I do, too.
I mean, I still do.

274
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,643
A lot of the villages in this part
of the Earth Kingdom are occupied

275
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,937
by the Fire Nation,
like this village was.

276
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:42,066
They prey on the weakest towns
and villages.

277
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,151
We should go visit
some of these towns, Aang.

278
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,904
- I need to tell you something.
- What is it, Aang?

279
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,867
I ran away before they trained me
to be the Avatar.

280
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,036
I don't know how
to bend the other elements.

281
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,164
Why did you run away?

282
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,918
The day they told me I was the Avatar,
they said I could never

283
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,005
have a normal life,
that I could never have a family.

284
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,508
They said it cannot work with
the responsibilities of the Avatar.

285
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,845
- Why can't the Avatar have a family?
- I asked that!

286
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:14,348
They said that's the sacrifice
the Avatar always has to make.

287
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,019
OK. So, what if we found you teachers.
Teachers to teach you bending?

288
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,021
Which element would you
have to learn first?

289
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,441
Water. Water comes
after Air in the cycle.

290
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,152
Air, Water, Earth, Fire.

291
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,363
But there are really powerful benders
in the Northern Water Tribe.

292
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,282
My dad told me about it before he left.

293
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,784
It's led by a princess because
her father died.

294
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,996
There are teachers there, but all
the way on the other side of the world.

295
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,790
- We can get there on Appa.
- That's what I was thinking.

296
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,043
And maybe we can stop
in the villages on the way,

297
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,712
start a change in The War
in these small villages.

298
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,090
- Should we try it?
- Yes, we should.

299
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,398
The scroll we had
was proving to be helpful.

300
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,193
Aang was practicing,
but for some reason,

301
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,779
he was having trouble
with Waterbending.

302
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,123
We moved from town to town
in the Earth Kingdom.

303
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,791
We tried to stay out of sight,

304
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:08,587
but Sokka became concerned
we were being followed.

305
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,497
Sire, I have good news.

306
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,000
As you know, I conducted a raid
on the Great Library,

307
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,419
- which most said didn't exist.
- Get on with it.

308
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:53,591
I found scrolls in the library.
We are deciphering them.

309
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,718
But I believe they may
contain information

310
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:59,096
as to where the Ocean and Moon
Spirits live in this world.

311
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,931
With this information,

312
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,601
we could bring down
the Northern Water Tribe city,

313
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:07,438
we could show the world
the true strength of fire.

314
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,273
I am pleased.

315
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,653
Well, Commander Zhao,
are the rumors true or not?

316
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,866
Our spies have discovered someone
claiming to be the Avatar.

317
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,036
They describe him as just a boy.

318
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,581
We should set a trap for this person.

319
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,334
We have many Earth Kingdom people
under our control.

320
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:31,670
I can leave soldiers
hidden in certain locations.

321
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,592
- And my son?
- He had his chance. He missed it.

322
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,887
Let's hope, for your sake,

323
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:44,892
my son doesn't find this person first
and he turns out to be the Avatar.

324
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,939
He would return as a hero and,
for all purposes, be your superior.

325
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:55,778
Well, I suppose it's a race, then.

326
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,925
We're close, Uncle.

327
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,428
They've been moving
farther and farther north.

328
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,598
We're catching them.

329
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,772
There are a lot of pretty girls
in this town, Zuko.

330
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,859
You could fall in love here.

331
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:39,446
We could settle down here,
and you could have a blessed life.

332
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,618
We don't have to continue this, Zuko.

333
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,290
I'll show you why we must, Uncle.

334
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,880
Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.

335
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,304
You look like a very smart boy.

336
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:09,602
Tell me what you know about the
Prince, the Fire Lord's son.

337
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:14,607
- He did something wrong.
- He spoke out of turn to a general,

338
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,734
in defense of some of his friends

339
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,821
who were going to be sacrificed
in a battle.

340
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:25,492
Then Prince Zuko
was sentenced to an Agni Kai duel,

341
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,077
but when he showed up,

342
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,123
- it was his father he was to fight.
- That's right.

343
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,834
He would not fight his father.

344
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:38,005
Then his father mocked him and said,

345
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,841
"I should bring your sister
up here to beat you."

346
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,929
Then the father burnt his son...

347
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,514
...to teach him a lesson.

348
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,860
We'll catch him soon, Uncle.

349
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,530
Then we can think
about the pretty girls.

350
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,334
Aang...

351
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,711
Try to keep your wrist bent,
like it's showing.

352
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,552
What's wrong?
You've really been distracted today.

353
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,556
I saw Sokka's maps.
We're near the Northern Air Temple.

354
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,477
Do you think it would be OK
if I just visited there and came back?

355
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,397
- I'd be back in less than a day.
- Why?

356
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,400
He had a vision
at the Southern Air Temple prayer field.

357
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,528
He talked to a Dragon Spirit
who he thinks can help us.

358
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:45,197
He thinks if he goes
to another spiritual place,

359
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,074
he can get back to the Spirit World.

360
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,995
I don't think that's a good idea.
We started a rebellion.

361
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,580
Try to talk him out of it.

362
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,135
I can't do this.

363
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,928
I need help.

364
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:04,068
- I guess your talk didn't work.
- He'll be back in a day.

365
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,280
The Fire Nation is following us. If we
make a wrong move, they'll catch him.

366
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,445
Who are you?

367
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,700
Why, it cannot be!

368
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,871
I've heard stories. Are you?

369
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,290
My name is Aang.

370
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,878
I cannot believe
I've lived to see your return.

371
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:09,883
I'm an Earth villager,
but I visit these temple remains often.

372
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:14,096
The Fire Nation destroyed this temple.
They have ruined everything.

373
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,391
No, no, no, not everything.

374
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:21,395
You know, there's
a hidden chamber of statues

375
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:24,356
I think you, of all people, should see.

376
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,568
These are all the Avatars.

377
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,573
These are the reincarnations
of you over the years.

378
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,246
The Avatar Roku was your last life.

379
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:46,753
Now, how did the Airbenders know
you were the Avatar, little one?

380
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,591
They gave me a test.

381
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:55,429
They put 1,000 toys in front of me
and asked me to choose four.

382
00:41:56,264 --> 00:42:00,184
They said I chose the same four objects
that belonged to the previous Avatars.

383
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,731
That's when they told me
I could have no family.

384
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,861
Told me I had a responsibility
to the Four Nations.

385
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,202
There's a ceremony
when everyone bows to me.

386
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,789
That's when I accept my role
as the Avatar.

387
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,752
But when everyone bowed...

388
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,382
...I didn't bow back.

389
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,135
You seem like a nice young man.

390
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:42,351
You really do.
You will forgive me, won't you?

391
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,480
- For what?
- For luring you down here.

392
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:53,987
I have lived in poverty
because of your absence, Avatar.

393
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,574
So you will understand
my actions today.

394
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,016
I have lived in poverty
because of your absence, Avatar.

395
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:33,318
I have seen a vision
of the moon turning red.

396
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:39,199
The Fire Nation has stolen knowledge
of us from the Great Library.

397
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,661
They are planning
to misuse this knowledge.

398
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,121
I will stop them.

399
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:48,333
You must go
to the Northern Water Tribe.

400
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:52,045
If they take that city,
more will suffer and die,

401
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,464
as your Airbenders have.

402
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,384
You must go now!

403
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,802
Will I stop them?

404
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,304
Wake up, young man!

405
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:07,311
My name is Commander Zhao.
I set this trap for you.

406
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,399
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.

407
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:18,071
Besides, you'd just be reborn again,

408
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,407
and then the search would continue.

409
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,581
So where have you been all this time?

410
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,585
And how is it that you're still a boy?

411
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,132
I understand that when you freed
that handful of towns,

412
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,593
you were very impressive, but...

413
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:44,931
...you only used Airbending
against my soldiers.

414
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,935
Now, why is that?

415
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:04,242
The Fire Lord and I have a plan

416
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,914
to ensure our reign
and the downfall of our enemies.

417
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:12,125
I am sending a personal message
to the Fire Lord,

418
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:15,128
informing him
that the once feared Avatar

419
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:19,508
is our prisoner
and no threat to our might.

420
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,629
Who are you?

421
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,591
Wait! Don't!

422
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,010
Stop!

423
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:32,706
Fools.

424
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:38,003
Close the inner gates!
The Avatar has escaped!

425
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,513
Lock down the gate!

426
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,058
Lock down all the gates!

427
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:09,034
To the main post!

428
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:10,827
This was their practice area.

429
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,580
Go again!

430
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,121
Do not kill the Avatar!

431
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,998
He will just be reborn again!

432
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,209
Why are you doing this? Who are you?

433
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:35,847
Open the gates.

434
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,184
Let them out!

435
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,037
- Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?
- Not at all.

436
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,040
Do it.

437
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,925
What is this?

438
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,986
And how did he escape?

439
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:01,451
I fear that your son
is not only incompetent,

440
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,495
but also a traitor.

441
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,372
Of course, I cannot prove this, sire.

442
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:11,836
You think...

443
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,632
...my son is this person

444
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,052
the soldiers are calling
the Blue Spirit.

445
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,640
Yes.

446
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,190
Zhao's men were searching the coast,
looking for you.

447
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,360
They also searched the ship.

448
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,531
I told them you went
on vacation with a girl.

449
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,328
Where were you the past four days?

450
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,207
Nowhere.

451
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,752
We have to keep moving.

452
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,089
The Avatar is traveling again.

453
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,050
Take rest first.

454
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,428
It looks like you
went through a great deal.

455
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:08,059
When you wake, we'll have tea together
before we start the engines.

456
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,571
Do not harm my son.

457
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,074
Leave him to his isolation.

458
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:27,787
You have my word, sire.
I will not harm him.

459
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,440
Zuko!

460
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,621
And what of the Avatar?

461
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,749
We assume he has
rejoined with his supporters.

462
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,303
It has been confirmed
that he's traveling north.

463
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:29,182
It is my strong belief that he is
traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.

464
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:34,812
I believe the child Avatar has only
knowledge of his birth element, Air.

465
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:39,859
I believe he is trying to learn
in the discipline of water.

466
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,196
He's gone to seek out someone
in the Northern Water Tribe,

467
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:48,284
where they have lived beyond our reach
and openly practice Waterbending.

468
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,916
We arrived at the Northern Water Tribe.

469
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,877
We presented ourselves
to the royal court.

470
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:46,551
My brother and the princess
became friends right away.

471
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:04,152
Aang showed them he
was the last Airbender,

472
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,071
and was accepted
to train with the master.

473
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,299
The city knew our arrival
would bring great danger.

474
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:30,595
And they prepared for war they knew
would come in the ensuing weeks.

475
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,769
The city was designed
to withstand any assault.

476
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:41,522
If we keep them to the courtyard
and the marketplace till night falls,

477
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:44,817
where we have the advantage,
we will succeed.

478
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,236
If we let too many of them
into the city,

479
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,781
their sheer numbers
could overwhelm us.

480
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:54,160
As many fires in this city should be put
out as possible when the alarm sounds.

481
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:57,872
We want to minimize
their bender sources.

482
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:02,168
I must assign a guard
to be with you at all times, Princess.

483
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,089
Your presence is our inspiration.

484
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,175
I'll do it. That's me.
I'll be her guard.

485
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:10,927
Nothing will happen to her.

486
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,681
I had a feeling you might volunteer.

487
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,521
I've heard no word of my son
for quite some time.

488
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,441
- Do you know where he is?
- I've not heard of anything, sire.

489
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,486
I'm sure word of him
will come to us soon.

490
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,405
The Northern Water Tribe benders
are given their strength

491
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:35,326
by the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
They will be difficult to defeat.

492
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:39,705
Now, if for some reason
the Spirits were not involved,

493
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,666
that would be different.

494
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,504
What have you learned
from the stolen scrolls?

495
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:51,384
We have deciphered the location
of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.

496
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:59,183
It is our destiny to have found
this information, Zhao.

497
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,022
Eliminate the Spirits,

498
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:09,694
take the city and we will have
thwarted the Avatar in the process.

499
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,666
Water is what?

500
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,419
The flowing element.
The element of change.

501
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,840
To master water,
you must release your emotions,

502
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,217
wherever they may lead you.

503
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:36,053
Water teaches us acceptance.

504
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,724
Let your emotions flow like water.

505
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:45,605
Aang, would you like to spar?
You haven't sparred in a few days.

506
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,764
Now, use offense, Aang!

507
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:17,363
General Iroh, I'm glad you could
accept my invitation to join us

508
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:21,784
- on this historic event.
- Your invitation was most gracious.

509
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:25,329
You are a gifted strategist.
No one can argue that.

510
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:30,668
Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege
of Ba Sing Se won't be held against you.

511
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,672
Your son died in that siege, didn't he?

512
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,842
Yes, he did.

513
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:42,430
Again, I offer my condolences
on your nephew burning to death

514
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,515
in that terrible accident.

515
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:47,977
Thank you.

516
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:58,446
I've loved spending
these weeks with you, Sokka.

517
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,114
Me, too.

518
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,121
Should we see what the ocean
is doing today?

519
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,796
When there is some safety for all of us,

520
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:18,758
I will come visit our sister city
in the Southern Water Tribe

521
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,177
and spend some time in your home.

522
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,220
That would be great.

523
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,141
But I warn you...

524
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:31,896
...my grandmother will ask you
a lot of questions.

525
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,571
What might she ask me?

526
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:47,411
She'll say, "Why is your hair white,
young lady? You look very odd."

527
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:52,583
I would say to your grandmother, my
hair is white because when I was born

528
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,752
I was not awake.

529
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,756
My mother and father could not get me
to make a sound or move.

530
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,425
So they prayed for days
to the Moon Spirit

531
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,428
and dipped me into the sacred waters.

532
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:11,602
My parents said that my hair turned
white then and life poured into me.

533
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,605
Wow.

534
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,109
You didn't tell me that.

535
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,278
You didn't ask me.

536
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:23,614
Only your grandmother did.

537
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:32,790
I'm sure Zhao was the one
who ordered the attack on you.

538
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,129
Any problems?

539
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,508
We have arrived at the Northern
Water Tribe's stronghold.

540
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,135
They believe the boy is there.

541
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,347
Why do you seem upset, Uncle?

542
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,184
Zhao has no sacredness.

543
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,687
Are you sure you want to be here?

544
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:02,653
I will not be allowed to live in peace
until I bring the Avatar to my father!

545
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:04,697
Is that not clear to you?

546
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,560
What is this?

547
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,230
Yue...

548
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:22,650
...the Fire Nation is here.

549
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:48,926
Now be sure to keep your uniform
closed up to your neck.

550
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:51,762
And remember, your Chi can warm you.

551
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,473
I know, Uncle.

552
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:08,612
Be safe.

553
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,177
Aang needs to ask you something.

554
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:16,221
I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit.

555
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,016
He can help me defeat the Fire Nation.

556
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,394
Is there a spiritual place
where I can meditate?

557
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:27,107
There is a very spiritual place.
The city was built around this place.

558
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,735
But we must hurry.

559
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:52,758
Momo, be nice.

560
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,638
To get your Airbending tattoos,

561
01:06:57,806 --> 01:07:02,893
you have to meditate for long
periods of time without losing focus.

562
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:07,064
Some of the great monks
can meditate for four days.

563
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:26,041
- I have to get back.
- I'll take you.

564
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:30,087
I'll stay with him.

565
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:51,650
Aang?

566
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:56,280
Aang, can you hear me?

567
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:01,452
I knew you were real.

568
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,622
I always knew you'd return.

569
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,000
Me, too.

570
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:13,297
The Fire Lord's son.

571
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,717
You took him from our village.

572
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,661
Who are you?

573
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,914
My name is Katara,

574
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,000
and I'm the only Waterbender left
in the Southern Water Tribe.

575
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,398
- Go for the children.
- Yes.

576
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,706
I'm not allowed to go home without him.

577
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:10,622
The Waterbenders get power
from the moon.

578
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:13,000
They will get stronger
as the day comes to an end.

579
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:17,588
General Iroh,
I've been keeping a secret.

580
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,840
And what is that?

581
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:23,594
In my raid of the Great Library
earlier this year,

582
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,138
I found a scroll that tells

583
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,891
the location
of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.

584
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:32,185
To meet a Spirit would be a great honor.

585
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,442
Well, I hope I can give you that honor.

586
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:23,320
What happened?

587
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:28,033
Prince Zuko's here in the city.
He took Aang again.

588
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,757
We'll just wait
till everyone's fighting everyone.

589
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,178
Then in the night, we'll slip out.

590
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:51,682
Aang, can you hear me?

591
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,937
I knew you were real.

592
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:01,191
I always knew you'd return.

593
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,862
Hello! Hello!

594
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:12,369
Please, tell me how
to beat the Fire Nation!

595
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:28,719
You are not dealing
with the loss of your people,

596
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:32,389
and your responsibility
for their deaths.

597
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,559
You are stopping yourself
from grieving.

598
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,561
You are angry.

599
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:41,231
You must let this go.

600
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:46,403
As the Avatar,
you are not meant to hurt others.

601
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,083
Use the ocean.

602
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:04,254
Show them the power of Water.

603
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:07,924
Go! Do this now.

604
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:14,848
My sister Azula
was always the special one.

605
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:17,642
She was a Firebending prodigy.

606
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,436
My father loves her.

607
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:30,280
He can't even look at me sometimes.

608
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,117
He says I'm like my mother.

609
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,131
I advise that you
pull back your men soon.

610
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,217
They will be trapped in the city
when the moon's power comes out.

611
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:35,262
Do not worry about the moon's power,
General Iroh.

612
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,514
Why should you not be worried
about the moon's power?

613
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,850
Because your brother,
Fire Lord Ozai, and I

614
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:43,895
have decided it is in our best
interests to kill the Moon Spirit.

615
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:46,189
What?

616
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,273
Calm down. We'll find him.

617
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:56,027
Are you OK?
Did the Spirits tell you anything?

618
01:16:56,195 --> 01:17:00,156
Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me.
I know what to do.

619
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:03,493
Aang, we have to go.

620
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:29,519
You won't be killed by Waterbenders
if you stay hidden here.

621
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:34,691
We could be friends, you know.

622
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:48,913
They're getting stronger.

623
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:54,878
This is a scroll from the Great Library.
This is our map.

624
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,256
Our world is going to change soon,
gentlemen.

625
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:00,759
Right there and right there.

626
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,409
See where they're going!
I'll go join the fight!

627
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:54,270
They are called many names:
Yin and Yang, push and pull.

628
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:59,859
May I introduce you to the mysterious
Ocean and Moon Spirits?

629
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:19,546
Why do Spirits take the form
of such benign things?

630
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,590
It leaves them so vulnerable.

631
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,342
To teach man kindness and humility.

632
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:28,346
Commander Zhao,

633
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:32,142
there are certain things
humankind should not tamper with.

634
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:34,644
The Spirits and the Spirit World
is one of them.

635
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,857
What are you doing here?

636
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,650
Stop, Zhao.

637
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:44,904
The world will go out of balance.
Everyone will be hurt.

638
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:50,994
The Fire Nation is too powerful

639
01:19:51,162 --> 01:19:54,998
to worry about children's superstitions,
General Iroh.

640
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:58,918
Commander Zhao, don't.

641
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:09,262
We are now the gods!

642
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:11,514
No!

643
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,949
Man all battle stations!

644
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:38,082
You are too soft, General Iroh.

645
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,391
He's making fire out of nothing!

646
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,585
They're breaching the wall!

647
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:25,713
To the front!

648
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:50,613
As the Avatar,
you are not meant to hurt others.

649
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,617
You must show them
the power of Water.

650
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:00,582
All is lost.

651
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,460
You have been anointed
by the Moon Spirit.

652
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:09,924
- He gave me life when I was a child.
- Then there is still a chance.

653
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:13,344
You can give your life
back for the Spirit's.

654
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:18,266
- Don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation.
- Nothing is ever truly lost.

655
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:26,899
- Is it mine to give back, if I choose?
- There are reasons each of us are born.

656
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:30,069
We have to find those reasons.

657
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:43,499
- This was the reason I was born.
- Yue, please.

658
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:47,587
There is no love without sacrifice.

659
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:50,590
Yue, what are you doing?
You don't know what will happen.

660
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:54,177
I believe my life force will leave my
body and return to the Moon Spirit.

661
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:55,345
And then what?

662
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:58,014
My soul will no longer exist
in this form.

663
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,267
Please don't do this.
There must be another way.

664
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:03,853
I can't let you do this.
I'm supposed to protect you.

665
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:06,105
My people are dying, Sokka.

666
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:09,025
Those who are in charge of others
have a responsibility.

667
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,903
It is time we show the Fire Nation
we believe in our beliefs

668
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:14,030
- as much as they believe in theirs.
- But Yue...

669
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:18,368
I'm scared.
Don't make me any more scared.

670
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:23,373
I will miss you more than you know.

671
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:02,013
I killed you.

672
01:25:04,183 --> 01:25:06,267
Come away from him, nephew.

673
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,979
There are too many soldiers now.

674
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:12,899
They will never
let you take the Avatar.

675
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:16,194
We must leave immediately.

676
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:19,572
He wants to fight you
so he can capture you, Zuko.

677
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:22,033
Walk away!

678
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,162
Come!

679
01:25:58,237 --> 01:25:59,737
You stand alone.

680
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:03,449
And that has always
been your great mistake.

681
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:04,028
Water teaches us acceptance.

682
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:09,241
Let your emotions flow like water.

683
01:32:13,612 --> 01:32:14,945
Aang?

684
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:20,010
They want you to be their Avatar, Aang.

685
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:26,016
We all do.

686
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:06,223
Our forces in the Northern Water Tribe
have failed to take the city.

687
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:09,226
General Zhao was killed in battle
and my brother has become a traitor.

688
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:11,603
My son's proven himself a failure.

689
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:18,319
Now, Sozin's Comet
is returning in three years.

690
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:22,072
It will give all Firebenders the ability
of the highest Firebenders,

691
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:27,077
the ability to use their own Chi
to create Fire.

692
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:31,415
That is the day we will win this war

693
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:34,418
and prove the Fire Nation's dominance.

694
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:39,590
Now you must stop the Avatar
from mastering Earth and Fire.

695
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:42,760
You must give us the time
to get to that day.

696
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:47,723
Do you accept this
unspeakably important task

697
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,016
I'm putting in your hands?

698
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,608
I do, Father.
