2
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:18,941
Good morning, Mr. Pouty-Pants!

3
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:28,848
Commander Sorbet.

4
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,782
What now?

5
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,750
It's Planet 448, sir.

6
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,618
The native uprising
has gotten worse.

7
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,786
We can't keep them
down for much longer.

8
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,821
Fine. Then send more soldiers.

9
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,055
That's the trouble, sir.

10
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:40,890
With all the fighting
on other worlds,

11
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:42,691
we barely have any to spare.

12
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,592
What?

13
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:49,830
Damn it. Disengage. Disengage!

14
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:04,709
This is Sorbet. Report.

15
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:06,043
Have you tracked
down the remaining.

16
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,844
Namekian survivors yet?

17
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:09,145
I'm sorry, Commander.

18
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,647
We've deployed a small
army of spy drones,

19
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,081
but they haven't
turned up anything.

20
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,083
We still can't find them.

21
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:18,786
Well then. There's no choice,
we'll go to Earth.

22
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:21,922
Planet Earth? But isn't that
a bit too dangerous, sir?

23
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:23,189
I know they have Dragon Balls

24
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:24,957
and that female
knows how to find them,

25
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,925
but she's in league
with the Super Saiyan!

26
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:29,694
Without the Namekians,
what else can we do?

27
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:31,929
Earth is a risk we have to take.

28
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,630
Besides, I have no intention of

29
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:35,031
involving that human woman.

30
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:37,633
Our spy drones may have
failed in other systems,

31
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:38,934
but they've helped on Earth.

32
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:41,169
According to their data,
she's not the only one

33
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,838
capable of finding Dragon Balls.

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,742
Tagoma! The two of us
are going to Earth.

35
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:51,845
Sir! But why not send out
a larger unit, sir?

36
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:55,580
It seems the
Earth Saiyans can detect

37
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:58,749
substantial power levels
without using a Scouter.

38
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,953
Obviously, more troops means a
bigger risk of being noticed.

39
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:05,822
Understood, sir.
We'll get the job done.

40
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:07,056
But Commander,
are you sure you want to

41
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:08,757
go down there yourself?

42
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,091
Of course I'm sure.

43
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:13,027
Lord Frieza is
coming back to life.

44
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,708
Commander Sorbet,
look! I've found them.

45
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,977
Looks like they've
already gathered six of them.

46
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,145
Then what are you
waiting for? Let's move!

47
00:04:35,147 --> 00:04:37,614
We have to catch them
before they've got them all!

48
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:38,848
Yes, sir!

49
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:45,221
Don't disappoint me.
You said the last one was here.

50
00:04:45,223 --> 00:04:47,122
Uh. That's right.
The ball should be

51
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:48,823
directly below this spot.

52
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,257
Of course, that's
where it gets tricky.

53
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,958
The ocean floor's
really deep here

54
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,660
so we'll need some kind
of submersible.

55
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,262
Tagoma,
dive down and retrieve it.

56
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,963
Right!

57
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,635
We'll, uh, be over here.

58
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,839
Mai! This is your
fault for not moving

59
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,273
quick enough
with the Dragon Radar!

60
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:14,875
Now these crazy alien jerks
are gonna snatch 'em all up

61
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:16,910
and steal the wishes
that should be ours!

62
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:18,211
You're the one who
said we cooperate,

63
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:19,645
you should've
just told 'em "no"!

64
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:20,712
Here's what we're gonna do now.

65
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:23,815
And you're gonna whip out
that pretty little sword.

66
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:24,982
Then chop-chop-chop-pow-pow-pow

67
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:26,049
and they're finished!

68
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,217
If we're trying to
beat 'em then shouldn't

69
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:31,853
I'm supposed to be
the brains of this operation!

70
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:34,222
But very well. Let's roll!

71
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:39,159
Aah!

72
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:44,029
Just because
I'm small doesn't mean

73
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:46,131
you should take
me lightly, Earthlings.

74
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:51,969
Aah!

75
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,954
We didn't mean to
get back home so late.

76
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,956
Hi, little Pan!

77
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,325
Oh, sorry Mommy
wasn't here sooner!

78
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,727
Unkie Piccolo's
green face must've been

79
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,829
really scary, huh?

80
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:25,799
Huh? You look worried,
what's wrong?

81
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:29,035
I'm sensing some bad
energy in that direction.

82
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:31,871
Huh. I do too,
now that you mention it.

83
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:33,873
But, what could it be?

84
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,307
I don't know.

85
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:37,042
Aw, you're okay, sweetie.

86
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:39,744
You're okay. Mommy's right here.

87
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:48,351
All right, get on with it.

88
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:50,819
Look. After we do this,

89
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,954
are you the kind of guy
who's gonna kill us?

90
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,722
Don't you worry, Earthling.

91
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:56,857
There's a chance we may
have use for you later,

92
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:59,192
so it's in our best
interest to keep you alive.

93
00:06:59,194 --> 00:07:02,061
Now go on.
Or don't you trust me?

94
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:04,129
Eeh. Sort of?

95
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,097
Hey. I have a
boyfriend named Trunks,

96
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,164
and if anything happens to me,

97
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,798
he'll make you regret it!

98
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,167
I'm not going to tell you again!

99
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:19,374
Eternal dragon Shenron!
By your name I summon you!

100
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,783
It just got dark. Could it be?

101
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,318
Yes. It's definitely Shenron.

102
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,091
I am the dragon, Shenron.

103
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:46,794
I shall grant you
any wish. Now speak!

104
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:49,296
He's all yours.

105
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:53,233
Go on, Commander.
This is our chance.

106
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:55,034
All right.

107
00:07:55,036 --> 00:07:57,202
Let's just hope this works.

108
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,173
I wish for Frieza!
Bring him back to life!

109
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:27,195
What? A-Are you deaf?

110
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:30,031
You told us I could
wish for anything, right?

111
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:33,134
Of course, it can be done.

112
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:37,938
But his body was cut to pieces
and obliterated many years ago,

113
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,839
and I cannot restore it.

114
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:44,176
There is little point in
returning his soul to that form.

115
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,186
He's still in pieces, huh?

116
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,321
Well great. That sucks.

117
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:02,023
But think about it. With the
new regeneration machines

118
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:04,191
we use for our troops,
this may not be a problem.

119
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:05,892
Even if the damage is severe,

120
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:07,860
we should still be
able to repair him.

121
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:10,128
Of course. That should work.

122
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,364
Hey! I don't care
what shape he's in,

123
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,399
just bring him back
like I told you!

124
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:19,836
It's unwise to be
rude to a dragon.

125
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:23,139
Eh. Sorry. Pretty please
bring Frieza back to life.

126
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:24,974
That better?

127
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:28,277
A foolish choice, but very well.

128
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:30,478
Hm.

129
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:43,187
Ah!

130
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:46,423
It's his eyeball!

131
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:52,361
Granted. Now what
is your second wish?

132
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:56,431
What? A second wish?
I didn't know I get two!

133
00:09:56,433 --> 00:10:00,201
Indeed. When Earth's
Guardian was replaced,

134
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:02,970
my powers were altered as well.

135
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:05,572
A second? What should it be?

136
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:08,341
I could wish to bring
King Cold back to life too.

137
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:11,010
Then we'd be really unstoppable.

138
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,012
We wish for a million zeni!

139
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,346
Hmm?!

140
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:25,321
Your wishes have been fulfilled.

141
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:28,190
I bid you farewell.

142
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:35,261
You'll pay for that!

143
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:37,096
Commander, wait!

144
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:38,397
There's no time for that!

145
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,031
The Saiyans may know
we're here now.

146
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,165
We have to move quickly!

147
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,067
Agh! Okay, fine. Get off me!

148
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:45,568
I know we packed a
cryo-preservation device

149
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,503
on the ship. We always do!

150
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,171
Don't just stand there, get it!

151
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:50,138
Yes, sir!

152
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,472
Augh!

153
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:57,610
This is Lord Frieza, after all.

154
00:10:57,612 --> 00:11:00,045
His strength, our tech?

155
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:03,147
I'm positive we can
put him back in one piece!

156
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:08,485
Um, excuse me, guys?

157
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:12,121
You're, uh,
forgetting something.

158
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:15,390
I think you might need it.

159
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:17,091
Eh-uh!

160
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,625
Yes, good work, Earthling.

161
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:21,527
We'll remember you if we
come back to this planet.

162
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,362
But next time
we'll have Lord Frieza

163
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:25,297
and our soldiers, too.

164
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:39,376
Way to think on your feet, Shou!

165
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:40,543
Though you could've
asked for more,

166
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:44,146
That would've been, you know,
a hundred times better.

167
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:46,481
Uh. I just thought,
this was enough.

168
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:48,182
If you're too rich
you're kids turn out to be

169
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:49,550
jerks who own night clubs.

170
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:51,418
Uuh... Yeah! You're right!

171
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,521
Now who wants
Mongolian barbecue?

172
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,589
Yay! I'm starving!
I want pudding too!

173
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,657
I'm getting a whole table of it!

174
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:02,227
It's gone now.
Wonder what that was about.

175
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:05,129
Something tells me
we're in trouble.

176
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:17,493
Ah... Welcome back, Lord Frieza.

177
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,495
It's great to see you.

178
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:21,696
And you are?

179
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:24,231
Uh. My name's Sorbet, my lord.

180
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,399
I was part of your
support staff before...

181
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,134
in the Third Stellar Region?

182
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:31,237
Oh. You do
look vaguely familiar.

183
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:34,173
Actually. I've been
leading your forces, my lord.

184
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:35,641
Just in your absence, of course.

185
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:37,509
You've been in charge?

186
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,677
Hm...

187
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,579
Seems I've actually
been brought back.

188
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:48,151
Yes. Using Dragon Balls and
our new regeneration machine.

189
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:50,319
Dragon Balls, you say? Ah.

190
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:53,188
Right, those orbs from
that miserable planet.

191
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,291
The fact is we couldn't
find the Namekian survivors.

192
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,760
So Tagoma and I risked
our lives going to Earth.

193
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:00,661
We used the Dragon
Balls there, instead.

194
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:02,429
Yes it's like he said, my lord.

195
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,431
I'm Tagoma and it was
my great honor to play

196
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,366
such a vital role
in bringing you back.

197
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:09,369
While I, Sisami,
managed the fleet.

198
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:11,304
These two have both been
outstanding warriors

199
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:15,474
rivaling even Zarbon
and Dodoria at their peaks!

200
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:18,543
Hm. It sounds like
you've done well, men.

201
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:21,646
Is it just hard to count
the days when you're dead,

202
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:24,649
or did it take you a long
time to restore my life?

203
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:26,717
Ah... I'm sorry, Your Lordship.

204
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:29,653
Between hunting down the
Dragon Balls and developing

205
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:32,555
the regeneration technology,
it wasn't easy.

206
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,523
Oh, I'll tell you
what isn't easy.

207
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:38,226
Suffering for all of
those years in Earth's Hell!

208
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:39,527
You must be relieved then!

209
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,295
We're so glad you're back!

210
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,197
Hm! I bet my empire's
been falling to pieces

211
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,598
without me here
cracking the whip.

212
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,734
And you only revived me
because you were desperate.

213
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:51,336
No, sir! That's not it, I swear!

214
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:53,504
It just took us a lot
longer than we hoped.

215
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,406
But on the bright side, it gave
us time to improve our tech!

216
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:57,707
We've restored you completely,

217
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,742
without any cyborg support!

218
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:03,579
Our plan was to bring
you back first, Lord Frieza,

219
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:06,415
and then King Cold, as soon
as we could make another wish.

220
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,517
Hm! No, I don't think we need to

221
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,318
worry about reviving him.

222
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,620
Father was bloated
with self-importance.

223
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:14,588
Yes. Of course.

224
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,790
Whatever you think
is best, my lord.

225
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:23,428
Ah-ahh!

226
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:25,862
Just as I suspected,
my skills have grown

227
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:28,497
a bit rusty around the edges.

228
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:30,499
It seems I may need
to wait a tad longer

229
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,700
before exacting
my sweet revenge.

230
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:34,835
Uh... Your revenge, sir?

231
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:36,570
Don't tell me you're surprised.

232
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:38,705
Of course my vengeance
must be satisfied!

233
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:41,874
I won't rest until both those
Super Simians are vanquished!

234
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,475
They'll pay for
what they did to me

235
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:44,809
and they'll pay in blood!

236
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,777
Forgive me if I'm
speaking out of turn.

237
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,745
But wouldn't it be
wiser to forget about

238
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,379
the Saiyans, my lord?

239
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:52,780
And focus on the
rest of the Universe?

240
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,584
Aah!

241
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:14,597
Commander Sorbet, help me!

242
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,832
Tagoma!

243
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:30,444
Shields! Raise the shields!

244
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:37,683
Either you brought
the most cowardly of my troops

245
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:39,618
to my welcoming party,
or the Frieza Force

246
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,686
has become woefully
faint of heart.

247
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:43,721
How do you expect us to
run an Empire that strikes

248
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:45,723
fear across the galaxies
while we're cowering from

249
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:47,691
a handful of Saiyan garbage?

250
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,359
But... But sir.

251
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:50,760
That Saiyan, Goku,
has gone through

252
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:52,394
a great deal
while you were gone.

253
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:55,397
He's faced all sorts
of foes and prevailed.

254
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,664
What are you telling me?

255
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,533
He's more formidable now
than when he bested me?

256
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:00,867
Uh... Yes, sir.

257
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:03,669
I know that's hard to hear,
but it's the truth.

258
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:07,806
I'd expect nothing less
from that monkey.

259
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:10,308
I'll just have to
become stronger myself.

260
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,676
It's as simple as that.

261
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:13,844
But my lord,
he even beat Majin Buu!

262
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,812
That's the last battle
our drones recorded.

263
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:17,613
Who knows if there were more!

264
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:22,650
In the Universe
I was never to challenge.

265
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:25,419
Beerus the Destroyer
and Majin Buu.

266
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:27,554
You're telling me
Goku beat that Buu?

267
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:29,455
Uh... Yes sir.

268
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:32,391
Then he's even
mightier than I dared to dream.

269
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:35,427
This could be
most salubrious for me.

270
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,762
Uh. I'm not sure
I know that word, sir.

271
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:40,865
It means beneficial to a
person's health and well-being.

272
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,833
And what could be more
salubrious for a conqueror

273
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,835
than the motivation
to become so strong

274
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:46,770
he's never dethroned again?

275
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,639
Um, as you say, my lord.

276
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:53,909
I've never trained
a day in my life.

277
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:59,548
Imagine what could happen if
I unlock my latent potential.

278
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,651
Hold on. You mean,
you could get stronger?

279
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,486
Stronger than your final form?

280
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:07,655
Of course, my minion.
Now shut your gaping mouth.

281
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:12,459
If I train in earnest
for the next four months...

282
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,761
Yes. I could reach
a power level of

283
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:16,929
one-point-three million.

284
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,715
Look, I already told you!

285
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:42,050
I am a super-elite
galactic patrolman!

286
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,985
Now go and get Bulma for me!

287
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:45,653
And like I keep telling you,

288
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:47,855
Bulma won't take visitors
without an appointment!

289
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,092
You foolish human!
Do you have any idea how far

290
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:54,661
I've come to tell her
the Earth is in danger!

291
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:57,597
Oh, Taco, long time no see!

292
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,532
Not Taco, Jaco!

293
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,634
Well, either way,
it's been a long time.

294
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:02,835
So what do ya say, Paco?

295
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:05,137
How 'bout I show you
my beautiful goldfish?

296
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:07,105
A fish made of gold?

297
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,078
Wow, those eyes are
more like what you see

298
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,779
in an Erukan bull frog.

299
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,747
That's because these
are pop-eyed goldfish.

300
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:20,849
Pretty cute, huh?

301
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,717
Whoa...

302
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,852
Hey!

303
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:29,755
Hold on! I don't
have time for this!

304
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:31,656
Oh. Right.

305
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,724
Oh, wow, it really is Jaco!

306
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:35,625
Long time no see, space cop.

307
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:38,527
What brings you
down to our planet?

308
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:40,829
I had an interesting talk
with your sister, Tights.

309
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,630
She tells me you're
buddies with the man who

310
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:44,765
defeated Frieza. Is that true?

311
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,867
Huh? Well, I guess,
technically there are

312
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:48,668
two people who've beaten Frieza.

313
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,970
The first, of course,
was my teenage son, Trunks.

314
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:54,006
And the other person was
our old family friend, Goku.

315
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:57,142
Granted I hadn't given
birth to him at that point

316
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:59,110
'cause he came from the
future in a time machine.

317
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:01,078
Right now he's
a cute little boy.

318
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,714
The future? You tell me
that like it's no big deal!

319
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:07,049
Galactic law specifically
states altering time

320
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,583
is a serious felony!

321
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:10,651
Well then those laws
are clearly stupid.

322
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:14,054
The reason I'm really here
is to see this friend of yours

323
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:17,123
who's beaten Frieza. I have
grave news to tell him!

324
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,692
Yeah, that's not
happening today, Jaco.

325
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:21,660
Right now he and my husband
are on some planet

326
00:20:21,662 --> 00:20:23,928
doing who knows what
with Lord Beerus.

327
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,663
Lord Beerus?

328
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:27,631
Oh, come on. You're in
the Galactic Patrol

329
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:28,798
and you don't know Beerus?

330
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,132
Lord Beerus the Destroyer!

331
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:31,967
They're friends
with Lord Beerus?

332
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,936
That's impossible!
You can't be friends with

333
00:20:34,938 --> 00:20:37,571
someone who doesn't
actually exist!

334
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:39,739
Think that if you want,
but it's your funeral.

335
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:42,174
I don't have time to debate
cosmic theology with you!

336
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:45,610
Frieza's been resurrected and is
on his way to Earth as we speak!

337
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,078
He's got a thousand men!

338
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,013
Huh? He's alive again?

339
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,081
The same Frieza who put me
through all of that trouble

340
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,682
back on Planet Namek?

341
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,949
Though I never
actually met the guy...

342
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:55,750
I'm not sure
what he looked like.

343
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:59,186
I did a quick sketch.

344
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,822
Okay, that's not
what I was picturing.

345
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:06,692
But seriously,
he couldn't be back!

346
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:07,826
Right?

347
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:08,993
Wrong.

348
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:10,995
And with a thousand soldiers?

349
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:14,231
And now that I've
told you, I'm outta here.

350
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:17,133
Because I'm young and smart
and do not feel like dying.

351
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:18,733
Well, good luck guys.

352
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,834
You could've told us that first,

353
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,802
instead of playing
with goldfish!

354
00:21:21,804 --> 00:21:24,638
Hey! Wait! Come back, Jaco!

355
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,107
Wait, Frieza's back?

356
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:32,776
Oh, Whis! Hello!

357
00:21:34,612 --> 00:21:35,912
Where are you, Whis?!

358
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:38,047
I've got a strawberry
sundae right here!

359
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:39,882
If you want it, you better
come down and eat it,

360
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:43,986
before the sun melts it!
It's a hot day today!

361
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:47,189
Dessert, really?! I just
told you Frieza's back!

362
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:49,991
Trust me, this is the best
way to get his attention.

363
00:21:49,993 --> 00:21:53,127
I need details. How long
'til Frieza gets here?

364
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:56,864
Hmm. I'd say in
about an hour or so.

365
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:58,866
You jerk!
Why didn't you say that?!

366
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:01,802
Now I have no time to
warn anyone who could help!

367
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,874
So rude.

368
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:20,284
Come on! Let's go!

369
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:26,123
We did it! We're as
rich as rich guys!

370
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,991
Can't wait to spend this loot!

371
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,961
Hey, watch it, Lardo!

372
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,832
Please don't.

373
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:44,303
Crap, they're coming for us!

374
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:45,904
I'm gonna floor it. Hold on!

375
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,772
Smoke 'em, boss!

376
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:02,784
This pig thinks he
can keep up with me?

377
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:04,852
Well, suck on this!

378
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:08,021
Awe yeah!

379
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,764
Hey, what the hell?!

380
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,766
Yeah, that was dangerous!

381
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,801
You think that was dangerous?

382
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,203
Are you kidding me?

383
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,005
You just robbed a bank!

384
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:33,073
Ooh...

385
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:34,874
Come on, guys.
Stop stealing stuff.

386
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,275
You're better than this.

387
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:39,110
We'll never do it again! Please!

388
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:41,712
We're sorry.
We play too many video games!

389
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:43,046
Don't tell my mom!

390
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,180
Huh?

391
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:49,818
What? Why's Bulma calling?

392
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,952
You're go for Krillin.

393
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:53,220
Oh, sorry Bulma,
but you got bad timing.

394
00:23:53,222 --> 00:23:55,755
Yeah, I'm in
the middle of a bust.

395
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:02,292
What? Frieza? That's impossible.

396
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:05,128
Right. Right. I'm on it, okay!

397
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,332
I'll find Master Roshi and get
him up to speed, don't worry.

398
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:11,901
Okay. I'll see ya soon.

399
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,135
Frieza, he's...

400
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:17,304
He's come back to life?

401
00:24:20,107 --> 00:24:21,340
I should be going too.

402
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:24,843
But I'm still a lot
stronger than you are.

403
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:26,978
Maybe, but it's more
important that you stay here

404
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,946
and take care of
our little Marron.

405
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:30,180
But actually,
there is one more way

406
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:31,848
you can help the cause.

407
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,182
I think I should go old school!

408
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:38,219
So Goku and Vegetta
aren't even here right now?

409
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:40,087
They're on some other
world with that cat?

410
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:43,023
We just have to hope
they get our message soon

411
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,025
so they can join the fight.

412
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:47,193
At least we still have
Buu and Gohan around, though.

413
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,928
They can buy us some time!

414
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:51,363
Well, see ya, babe!

415
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:57,935
He's so cool.

416
00:24:58,803 --> 00:25:01,070
We'll be arriving
at Earth shortly, my lord.

417
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:04,038
You're telling me
you've had a decade

418
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,073
and the most advanced
fleet of all time,

419
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:09,042
yet you only found one of
the Saiyans who killed me?

420
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:11,244
Yes, believe me, sir.
We started hunting for

421
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:13,279
the other one the moment
after you passed on.

422
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:15,114
But no matter where
in the Universe we looked,

423
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:19,052
It's possible he simply retired
to some backwoods world,

424
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:20,353
or maybe even died.

425
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:22,421
We're confident the
only two Saiyans on Earth

426
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:23,989
are Goku and Vegetta.

427
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:25,991
Unless you count their
half-breed offspring,

428
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:27,292
one of which is fully grown.

429
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,127
Fine. We'll start there.

430
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,429
But Lord Frieza,
once you get revenge,

431
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,098
what's to stop someone
from using the Dragon Balls

432
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,500
to bring the Super Saiyan
back to life all over again?

433
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,502
Ha! A worthy concern.

434
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:41,371
That's why I'll destroy the
Earth while destroying him.

435
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,272
Then the Dragon Balls,
as well as that Hell,

436
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:45,140
will be permanently expunged.

437
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:47,008
I see, my lord.

438
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,276
That reminds me, do you
remember our contingency

439
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:51,077
in case things
don't go as planned?

440
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:53,145
Yes, of course. I'll be ready.

441
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:54,479
Good. Let's go.

442
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,069
Oh. I love spring.

443
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:27,104
Quit your daydreaming!

444
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:34,109
Damn it! He's just mocking us!

445
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:35,443
Huh?

446
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,251
Really, Kakarot?
Even now you've gotta

447
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:45,452
get a shot in at me?

448
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:47,954
Relax, Vegetta! That was
an honest mistake!

449
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,355
Oh, my. Such bickering.

450
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,590
Ugh! Kakarot,
just stay outta my way.

451
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:54,025
It's time I got
Whis all to myself!

452
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:55,459
What? Vegetta, wait!

453
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:05,033
Down you go.

454
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,540
Huh?

455
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:22,478
Hm.

456
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,258
Easy now.

457
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:41,027
I-I can't move.

458
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,495
Aah!

459
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,236
Haaa!

460
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:52,637
Who's got the upper hand now?

461
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,113
Okay, boys, I think
we're done for now.

462
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,522
Neither of you yet possesses
the necessary speed.

463
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:16,258
Look. I even signed
both your tops!

464
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,627
What? When did you do that?

465
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:21,162
You two are still
thinking before you move,

466
00:28:21,164 --> 00:28:23,097
rather than just moving.

467
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:24,598
I'm afraid this habit
is especially strong

468
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,299
with you, Vegetta.

469
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:29,468
This over thinking is
limiting your fighting speed.

470
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,169
Messages can only travel through

471
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:33,137
your nervous system so fast.

472
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:35,172
When you rely on thoughts
for physical action

473
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:36,573
you lose precious fighting time.

474
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:40,109
You really do like to
over think everything, Vegetta.

475
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:43,545
You're only thinking less
because you're an idiot!

476
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:46,314
Your end goal should be
to master the ability

477
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:48,549
to have each part of
your body think and move

478
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:50,417
independently
of the other parts.

479
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:52,552
But I admit this
is exceedingly difficult.

480
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:54,554
In fact, not even
Lord Beerus has mastered it,

481
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:56,522
and he's a god.

482
00:28:56,524 --> 00:28:58,323
If you can overcome
the learning curve,

483
00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:01,392
you'll be able to avoid
any danger, however severe.

484
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,394
So, allow me to take
you through every step

485
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:07,597
of the training required,
in a most meticulous fashion.

486
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,232
In exchange for
delicious foods, of course.

487
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:13,401
You mean your body reacts
without you having to think?

488
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,336
That's exactly right!

489
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:17,137
But, uh,
Mister Whis, it looks like

490
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,671
you stepped in some poop.

491
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:22,540
Ew, ew, ew!

492
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:25,475
Well my feet do think
for themselves,

493
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,510
but I said nothing
about my shoes.

494
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:30,312
Anyway, let's get
back to you, Vegetta.

495
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:33,315
You are clearly
an extraordinary fighter

496
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:34,582
on your own. And yet,

497
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:36,317
for whatever reason,
you're always

498
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,452
one step behind
Goku, am I right?

499
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:41,288
Oh, you just had to
bring that up didn't you?

500
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,356
Do you know why
you're Goku's lesser?

501
00:29:43,358 --> 00:29:45,324
Please teach me, oh-wise one.

502
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,426
You walk through life with
a chip on your shoulder,

503
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:49,227
and your nerves wound too tight.

504
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:50,595
This tension makes
it hard for you to move

505
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:52,697
and fight at your
full potential.

506
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:55,499
And so, your first
lesson is learning to relax.

507
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,534
When there's a chance
to rest, you must take it.

508
00:29:57,536 --> 00:30:02,170
Whis is right.
I do love me a good nap.

509
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:03,604
But you have problems, too.

510
00:30:04,707 --> 00:30:06,473
Ooh!

511
00:30:09,344 --> 00:30:12,511
What was that for?
That was a total sucker punch!

512
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:15,347
Being too relaxed can
also be a weakness.

513
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,715
And don't even get me started on

514
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:18,616
the issues with
your overconfidence.

515
00:30:18,618 --> 00:30:20,584
No matter how strong
you are physically,

516
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,653
if you let your focus waver,
you're set up to fail.

517
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,122
I've noticed many
times where you're so sure

518
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,357
of yourself, you let your
guard down in battle.

519
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,259
Heh. He's got that one right.

520
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,561
Well I still think
it was cheap shot.

521
00:30:33,563 --> 00:30:35,596
What is going on up here?

522
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:38,332
Some of us are trying
to sleep, you know!

523
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:54,146
That's one heck of a sneeze!

524
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:55,447
If we got hit by that,
Whis would be

525
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:57,749
scraping our bodies
off the ground.

526
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:59,650
He gets like
this when he's sleepy.

527
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:02,552
Could be worse.
He once plunged this planet

528
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:03,753
into darkness
when he accidentally

529
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:05,454
destroyed those two suns.

530
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:06,521
Wait, if he blew 'em up,

531
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:08,256
then how are they out there now?

532
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:10,625
Are you guys powerful
enough to make stars?

533
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:13,527
Of course not. In rare
cases like that one,

534
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:16,329
I simply perform
a temporal do-over.

535
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:20,299
I reverse time to right
before the incident happens,

536
00:31:20,301 --> 00:31:22,267
and then instead of
letting Beerus do it,

537
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:24,636
I give him a quick
bop on the noggin.

538
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:27,205
All right, what the
hell are you? Explain.

539
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:30,741
Now what's the
best way to explain this?

540
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:33,677
I'm simply the life form
that's known as Whis!

541
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,546
At the moment, it's my
job to look after Lord Beerus.

542
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:39,482
As you've no doubt seen,
he has some eccentric manners

543
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:40,749
and a mighty temper.

544
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:42,717
So I need certain
skills to cope with him.

545
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:44,518
Sounds like the
old Destroyer can be...

546
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,553
Hey! What are you two
punch-jockeys doing up here!

547
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:48,688
Ee! Oh! Hi, Mister
Lord Beerus, sir.

548
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,723
We asked your
servant Whis to train us.

549
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,758
I figured that much...
I'm not a fool.

550
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,327
What I mean is how
did you two get here?

551
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:56,461
Don't be mad, your Lordness!

552
00:31:56,463 --> 00:31:57,595
We got in touch with Mister Whis

553
00:31:57,597 --> 00:31:59,196
and asked him to bring us here!

554
00:31:59,198 --> 00:32:04,401
Had to hitch a ride with him!
It was the only way!

555
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:07,303
So, Whis brought
you here. Hah! Let me guess.

556
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:08,771
All it took to
get on your good side

557
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,306
was something high in calories.

558
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:13,541
Yup! You guessed it.

559
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:16,510
And why is it so important to
build your strength, Goku?

560
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:18,578
I hope all this training
isn't your secret way of

561
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,646
gunning for the
job of Destroyer.

562
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,447
Oh, no I'd never want your job!

563
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:24,248
All I want is to get stronger!

564
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,849
And I won't let this
clown leave me in the dust,

565
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:27,450
so I'm training too.

566
00:32:27,452 --> 00:32:29,585
It hadn't dawned on me
'til now just how poorly.

567
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:33,522
If you ever found a way
to work together for once,

568
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:35,223
you would be able
to go toe-to-toe.

569
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:39,427
No one asked to hear
your opinion, Whis! Can it!

570
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:41,529
Please. We tried
that once and I'll never.

571
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:45,566
Vegetta doesn't bug me as
much as I seem to bother him,

572
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,734
but when it comes to fighting,
I work on my own!

573
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:49,669
Well, I've said my peace.

574
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:52,538
Hmph. So, what was the price?

575
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,673
What mouth-watering
dish did you bring?

576
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:58,609
Ah, yes! This time,
a delicacy called, "pizza."

577
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:01,745
Ooh. What a ridiculous
name for a food!

578
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,379
Is there any left for me to try,

579
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,347
or did you already
eat it, you swine?

580
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:06,782
Don't worry, my lord,
I made sure

581
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,784
to save some leftovers for you!

582
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,886
Excellent! I shall eat pizza.

583
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,888
But if it's not
absolutely delicious,

584
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,590
I'll destroy you both for
interrupting my slumber,

585
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:16,624
do you hear me?!

586
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:17,791
Loud and clear, sir!

587
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:19,592
I'll heat it up
so it tastes better.

588
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:21,460
Hold on a minute. I heard that.

589
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:22,727
When I asked what
they brought you,

590
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:24,528
you used the phrase "This time."

591
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,363
Does that mean you
Earth-huggers have come here

592
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:27,764
repeatedly while I was sleeping?

593
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,744
Aah!

594
00:33:42,746 --> 00:33:44,545
What the hell?

595
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,619
They're here!

596
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,021
It feels like they
set down near North City!

597
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,601
Make some room,
you're blocking the view.

598
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:08,487
Destroying a city is such
a fun way to say, "Hello."

599
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:11,856
Ah! That cold-blooded monster!

600
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:13,824
He's gonna pay for this!

601
00:35:20,564 --> 00:35:21,897
Hm?

602
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:34,840
Heh!

603
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,808
I didn't bring
Chiaotzu or Yamcha.

604
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,743
These guys are too
dangerous for them.

605
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:40,878
Yeah, Bulma made me promise
I wouldn't say a word

606
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,080
about Frieza's comeback
to Trunks or Goten.

607
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:45,082
Knowing those two, they'd
challenge him to a duel.

608
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:47,884
The cavalry has arrived!

609
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:52,954
Sorry we're a little bit late.

610
00:35:52,956 --> 00:35:55,022
We figured we should stop
by Korin's place first

611
00:35:55,024 --> 00:35:56,890
to pick up some Senzu Beans.

612
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:58,591
Wow, Krillin. It's sure
been a while since

613
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:00,559
I've seen you go full cue ball!

614
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:02,561
I know! Back in fighting shape.

615
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:04,029
But let's talk about
you for a moment.

616
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,964
What is going on
with that tracksuit?

617
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:08,633
Oh, right. Heh.
It all happened so fast,

618
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:10,635
I had no time to find my gi.

619
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:12,970
Gohan. Have you kept
up on your martial arts

620
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:14,104
training at all?

621
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,738
Not really, Master Roshi.

622
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
But I can definitely
still turn Super Saiyan

623
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,808
when I want to, maybe!

624
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:22,777
Is Goku not here yet?

625
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:25,012
No, but he is coming
soon, you'll see!

626
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:26,847
Oh look, the little bald one!

627
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:29,683
I have a distinct memory of
killing him back on Namek.

628
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:32,018
Ha! Well it seems the
Dragon Balls can resurrect

629
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,653
the powerful and the pathetic.

630
00:36:34,655 --> 00:36:35,987
The Dragon Balls?

631
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:38,889
So they're the ones
who summoned Shenron.

632
00:36:58,173 --> 00:37:00,674
Well. I'm guessing the
creepy white and purple guy

633
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,942
in the hover pod is Frieza.

634
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:04,610
Which means
you're a better artist

635
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:05,777
than I gave you credit for!

636
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:09,013
Bulma! Why would you
come to ground zero

637
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:10,681
of Frieza's invasion!

638
00:37:10,683 --> 00:37:13,150
I haven't had any luck
contacting Goku or Vegetta yet,

639
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:15,051
so I figured I'd be
safer with you guys!

640
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:16,652
Jaco, get out of that spaceship

641
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:18,053
and help my friends
fight these jerks!

642
00:37:18,055 --> 00:37:20,922
Negative! All I said was
that I'd give you a lift.

643
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:23,057
Oh come on!
You're a galactic patrolman

644
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:25,059
and there are freaking
aliens invading the planet!

645
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:26,660
Isn't this your job?

646
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,062
Okay, I'll help.
I'll take on some of.

647
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:31,664
Frieza's soldiers,
preferably the weaker ones.

648
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,965
So who's Mister Spaceman?

649
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,067
Beats me. I'll never
understand how Bulma

650
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:37,636
has so many weirdo friends.

651
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:39,004
Hmph. I thought this might be

652
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,939
a Super Saiyan arriving,

653
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:43,975
but that symbol is for
the Galactic Patrol.

654
00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:46,109
Hey, creep!

655
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:47,977
Were the first
two losses not enough?

656
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,979
How'd you come
back to life, anyway?

657
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:51,814
Hey, stop! You should
be more polite

658
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,115
with guys who can kill you!

659
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,150
Well there aren't many
humans who know who I am,

660
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:57,652
so I can only assume
you were on Planet Namek

661
00:37:57,654 --> 00:38:00,087
during my battle with
your filthy Saiyan friend?

662
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:01,988
I'll give you one
final chance to tell me

663
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,689
where that fool Goku is.

664
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:05,090
You're not just
obsessed with revenge,

665
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:07,826
you suck at it, too!
What took you so long?

666
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,762
Suffice it to say that I was
tied up for a bit longer

667
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:12,963
than I would have liked.

668
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,664
Well as strong as Goku's gotten,

669
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,732
he's gonna make your face
look even worse!

670
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:19,835
If I were you, I'd leave before
I start a fight I can't win!

671
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:22,103
Stop it, Bulma.
You're not helping!

672
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:24,105
If I've come all
this way and he no-shows,

673
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:26,941
I suppose I'll just have to
execute his friends.

674
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:29,877
The grief that would cause
might be worth the trip.

675
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:32,012
Gohan, you've gotten a lot
stronger too over the years,

676
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:33,680
you can handle him, right?

677
00:38:33,682 --> 00:38:35,815
I can handle his men. I guess.

678
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:37,016
But this is serious, Bulma.

679
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:38,650
I don't think you
understand what kind of

680
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,118
opponent Frieza is.

681
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,819
It took my dad everything he had

682
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:45,721
and Frieza's powered up to
a totally different level.

683
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,022
We can't beat him.

684
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,858
Huh? Oh. Oh crap.

685
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,160
Uh, sorry Mister Lord
Frieza, but Goku is still

686
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:54,061
on his way back to Earth.
Do you mind waiting

687
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:55,962
non-violently for
just a little bit longer?

688
00:38:55,964 --> 00:38:59,832
I've already spent years
waiting patiently in Hell

689
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:02,134
for the chance to get
revenge against the Saiyan.

690
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:06,104
I will give Goku another
ten seconds to show.

691
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:08,005
What? Just ten seconds?

692
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:11,174
Stingy jerk! Screw you!

693
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:16,011
Well don't say I didn't
give you a chance.

694
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:19,180
Soldiers! Give them
everything you've got!

695
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:25,684
Here they come!

696
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:33,691
Right! Let's do this!

697
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:35,759
So by my estimation,

698
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:38,228
your quota's a hundred
and seventy soldiers each!

699
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,031
That should hold the line
'til Goku and Vegetta get here!

700
00:39:56,245 --> 00:39:57,744
Hm!

701
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:02,114
Kamehame-Ha!

702
00:40:05,785 --> 00:40:07,118
Oh crap.

703
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,786
Ha!

704
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:09,953
Hu-ah!

705
00:40:18,194 --> 00:40:19,260
Aah!

706
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:24,097
Bang!

707
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:50,251
Hya!

708
00:40:55,355 --> 00:40:57,089
The odds are way
too high against us.

709
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:59,757
Don't fight in
one place! Spread out!

710
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,162
For a Frieza Force they're
a pretty motley crew,

711
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,930
which works for me!

712
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:13,768
What the...?

713
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:20,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ow!

714
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:23,209
Gotta jet!

715
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:42,992
Tri-beam ha!

716
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:55,167
Kamehame...

717
00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:01,505
You should learn to
respect your elders!

718
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,377
Eh?

719
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:20,919
Destructo Disk! Ya!

720
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:00,316
Got a present for ya!

721
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:02,484
Huh? Uh-ahhh!

722
00:43:04,386 --> 00:43:06,553
What was that about, freak?

723
00:43:06,555 --> 00:43:09,122
Don't worry,
I didn't forget you.

724
00:43:09,124 --> 00:43:11,290
Hu... aaah!

725
00:43:15,162 --> 00:43:17,529
Ah. That takes a load off.

726
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,400
Say your prayers!

727
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,240
These guys just don't let up!

728
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:02,264
Aah!

729
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:10,171
Hey buddy. Thanks.
That was close.

730
00:44:10,173 --> 00:44:12,573
Sure, you'd do
the same. Right, pal?

731
00:44:12,575 --> 00:44:16,142
Stay here and get some rest.
I'll be right back.

732
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:24,149
Full force, attack!

733
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,043
Later!

734
00:45:02,248 --> 00:45:03,548
Ya!

735
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:14,324
Huh?

736
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:25,164
Whoa!

737
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:43,414
I don't know you,

738
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:45,082
but you've got some moves!

739
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,688
The feeling's mutual.
Who are you?

740
00:45:53,424 --> 00:45:56,125
I'm just an Earthling
that knows how to fight!

741
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:58,126
Really? I thought
you were too strong

742
00:45:58,128 --> 00:46:00,161
and too funny-looking
to be from here.

743
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:04,331
No. How are they
winning? This can't be!

744
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:07,167
Oh, this is not
surprising me in the least.

745
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:09,302
That son of Goku could
wipe out my thousand-man

746
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:12,338
army in an instant,
if he was so inclined.

747
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,106
Watch him closely and
you'll see his attacks

748
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:15,440
are deliberately non-lethal.

749
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:18,176
The boy has a soft heart,
like his father.

750
00:46:18,178 --> 00:46:20,278
Despite all my heinous
provocations on Namek,

751
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,147
Goku still couldn't will
himself to destroy me.

752
00:46:23,149 --> 00:46:25,682
He's a noble man of
great moral clarity.

753
00:46:25,684 --> 00:46:28,518
So pure. It makes
me want to vomit!

754
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,419
Lord Frieza. Sorbet.

755
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,154
Permission to join
in the battle?

756
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,122
Hmm. Good idea.

757
00:46:40,294 --> 00:46:43,362
I'll start with you, Namekian!

758
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:46,597
Hm.

759
00:46:59,607 --> 00:47:02,342
Special Beam Cannon!

760
00:47:03,444 --> 00:47:04,510
Rest in peace.

761
00:47:04,512 --> 00:47:06,445
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

762
00:47:11,216 --> 00:47:12,549
Aah!

763
00:47:16,154 --> 00:47:17,620
Mm!

764
00:47:22,124 --> 00:47:23,524
Hey Piccolo!

765
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,230
I had him, Gohan!

766
00:47:33,232 --> 00:47:36,399
Maybe so, but let's
not take any chances.

767
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:38,167
Hmmm.

768
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:43,438
What the he...?

769
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:57,550
No. It's not fair!
Not Sasami too!

770
00:47:57,552 --> 00:48:00,452
You'd only seen recordings
of these monkeys in action.

771
00:48:00,454 --> 00:48:02,520
Until you've felt the
heat of a Super Saiyan

772
00:48:02,522 --> 00:48:04,522
staring you down,
you can't possibly

773
00:48:04,524 --> 00:48:07,324
comprehend their power!

774
00:48:07,326 --> 00:48:10,593
Although, I didn't
expect his son to transform.

775
00:48:10,794 --> 00:48:12,461
Here.

776
00:48:13,463 --> 00:48:16,164
Here, want one? ...No thanks.

777
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:18,766
It looks like Frieza's
finally ready to fight.

778
00:48:25,606 --> 00:48:28,541
Pathetic. Not that I couldn't
tell the moment I awoke,

779
00:48:28,543 --> 00:48:30,776
but the Frieza Force has
suffered quite the decline.

780
00:48:30,778 --> 00:48:32,310
Eeh.

781
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:34,679
Please, forgive us.

782
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:36,414
They're a lot stronger...

783
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:39,316
than we thought
they'd be, your lordship.

784
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:40,750
Oh it makes little difference.

785
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,685
But the aesthetics
is another matter.

786
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:44,520
I can't stand the sight
of all your anemic,

787
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,422
broken bodies dressed
in my uniforms.

788
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,759
Everyone get back, now!

789
00:49:06,439 --> 00:49:09,239
Jeez. Glad I don't work for him.

790
00:49:11,442 --> 00:49:13,609
Wow. They're just
as impressive as ever.

791
00:49:13,611 --> 00:49:16,446
But the real threat hasn't
even started fighting yet.

792
00:49:16,448 --> 00:49:18,381
The terror of
Frieza is so legendary,

793
00:49:18,383 --> 00:49:20,416
even the Galactic
Patrol is afraid of him.

794
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:21,950
Your friends could all
be dead meat, you know.

795
00:49:21,952 --> 00:49:23,818
Telling me that is not helpful!

796
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,952
What are you doing here anyway?

797
00:49:24,954 --> 00:49:28,422
The more fighters we have
the better our chances!

798
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,457
Oh don't be absurd.
I've already done more than

799
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:32,826
enough in this fight.
My superiors would never

800
00:49:32,828 --> 00:49:35,495
expect me to challenge
the Evil Emperor himself!

801
00:49:35,497 --> 00:49:38,464
We have a strict policy
against suicide missions.

802
00:49:43,602 --> 00:49:44,969
What do ya think, boys?

803
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:48,339
If all five of us team up,
do we have a shot against him?

804
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:49,973
I'm sorry, but no.

805
00:49:49,975 --> 00:49:52,375
He's in a completely
different class than we are,

806
00:49:52,377 --> 00:49:56,579
Yeah I was thinking the
same thing but I had to ask.

807
00:49:56,581 --> 00:49:58,914
Just wanted to make sure
I wasn't being a chicken.

808
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,548
So the Earth's valiant defenders

809
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:01,849
aren't going to advance?

810
00:50:01,851 --> 00:50:03,584
I suppose I'll
have to entertain myself

811
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:05,485
by killing you, one by one.

812
00:50:10,356 --> 00:50:13,924
I remember when Goku's son
was just a little boy.

813
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:17,593
It's so touching to see
children grow into their own.

814
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,000
Gohan!

815
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:30,969
There we have it! Not even a

816
00:50:30,971 --> 00:50:32,937
strapping young
Super Saiyan can match

817
00:50:32,939 --> 00:50:35,572
the unstoppable force
of nature I've become.

818
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,674
Come on, stay with me.

819
00:50:37,676 --> 00:50:39,409
Yeah. He's in real trouble.

820
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,877
I think his heart
stopped beating.

821
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:42,812
He can't swallow a Senzu Bean.

822
00:50:42,814 --> 00:50:44,513
Give me some room!

823
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:50,751
Down the hatch.

824
00:50:50,753 --> 00:50:53,920
My! That's an
interesting development.

825
00:50:53,922 --> 00:50:57,590
Apparently you Earthlings
have attained a wonder drug.

826
00:50:57,592 --> 00:50:59,758
But how much
time can it buy you?

827
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,793
A few minutes, at best?

828
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:03,761
Hey. How many more
of those Senzu Beans

829
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:05,429
do we have, Krillin?

830
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,899
Uh! We've got
one more, that's it.

831
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,445
Ha-ha-haaaa!

832
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,980
Hey, Whis!

833
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:26,781
You hollered, my lord?

834
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,716
What's this stuff called again?

835
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,918
The gooey, stretchy
substance on top?

836
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,554
Let's see, what was
it called? Starts with a "C."

837
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:35,788
It's cheese.

838
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,556
Cheese! Cheese, that's it!

839
00:51:37,558 --> 00:51:38,890
It's a bit pungent
but I love it,

840
00:51:38,892 --> 00:51:40,691
especially when it's all melty!

841
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:41,958
Aw come on, Lord Beerus.

842
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,626
Do you really have to
interrupt our training

843
00:51:43,628 --> 00:51:44,960
to talk about food?

844
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:46,628
If I want to, yes.

845
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,596
And I don't recommend
you take that sort of tone

846
00:51:48,598 --> 00:51:50,531
with a Destroyer again.

847
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:52,666
Don't forget,
your planet's culinary feats

848
00:51:52,668 --> 00:51:54,834
are the only reason
it continues to exist.

849
00:51:54,836 --> 00:51:56,769
But if you prefer,
I can destroy it now

850
00:51:56,771 --> 00:51:58,637
and you can practice in peace.

851
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:00,905
No, no, that's okay! I'm sorry.

852
00:52:00,907 --> 00:52:02,072
Ha!

853
00:52:04,943 --> 00:52:07,743
Someone's not
checking his messages!

854
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:09,578
You got a call from
Earth a while ago,

855
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,012
and I sense it's important!

856
00:52:11,014 --> 00:52:12,713
Uh!

857
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:16,583
Oh yes, you're right.
It seems I did miss a call.

858
00:52:16,585 --> 00:52:18,818
I wonder if it's another
delectable food offering

859
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,020
from Lady Bulma.
Wouldn't that be nice.

860
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:24,088
Oh, it is!
And what's she call it?

861
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,756
A strawberry sundae?

862
00:52:25,758 --> 00:52:28,725
I can only hope it tastes
as magnificent as it looks.

863
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:30,827
Well the girl certainly
has piqued my interest.

864
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:32,829
I'll just check in
and find out more.

865
00:52:32,831 --> 00:52:34,530
Hurry, I want to know too!

866
00:52:34,532 --> 00:52:38,934
Hello, Lady Bulma?!
This strawberry sundae of yours,

867
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:41,569
it wouldn't happen to be
a "sweet," would it?

868
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:43,504
Oh? Is that Whis?

869
00:52:43,506 --> 00:52:45,005
What the hell took you so long?!

870
00:52:45,007 --> 00:52:46,673
I've been waiting forever!

871
00:52:46,675 --> 00:52:48,574
Vegetta and Goku
are there, right?

872
00:52:48,576 --> 00:52:49,975
Well tell 'em to come home, now!

873
00:52:49,977 --> 00:52:51,977
And I don't want to hear
any crap about training!

874
00:52:51,979 --> 00:52:53,678
It's an emergency!

875
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,746
That evil scumbag Frieza
has come back to life,

876
00:52:55,748 --> 00:52:57,514
and the Earth's in danger!

877
00:52:58,483 --> 00:53:00,583
Scumbag am I?

878
00:53:00,585 --> 00:53:01,985
Frieza's back to life? Say what?

879
00:53:01,986 --> 00:53:04,586
That can't be true. No way.

880
00:53:04,588 --> 00:53:05,820
After all these years?

881
00:53:05,822 --> 00:53:07,521
Just hold on!
We'll have Whis take us.

882
00:53:07,523 --> 00:53:11,124
It takes about thirty-five
minutes at maximum speed.

883
00:53:11,126 --> 00:53:13,658
Are you nuts?
We can't wait that long!

884
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,760
Use your Instant
Transmission, Goku!

885
00:53:15,762 --> 00:53:17,128
This isn't a joke!

886
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,830
Uh, I've gotta sense my
target for it to work, Bulma,

887
00:53:19,832 --> 00:53:21,865
and I'm not sure I can
from this far away.

888
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:23,633
Frieza's energy is huge, right?

889
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:25,134
And the guys will help too!

890
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:27,669
Hey, Goku's about to
use Instant Transmission

891
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:29,737
and he needs a clear
signal to lock onto!

892
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,672
Everybody power up to max!

893
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:33,073
Huh? Okay!

894
00:53:37,977 --> 00:53:41,612
Uh... What are
they doing, my lord?

895
00:53:41,614 --> 00:53:45,548
I'd guess it's a distress
signal to their savior.

896
00:53:47,584 --> 00:53:49,918
I've got it!
Here, Vegetta, let's go!

897
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,853
What? Please.
You're actually asking me.

898
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:54,956
Just do it, okay!
You know how Bulma gets!

899
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:56,624
We've gotta get there
before she says something

900
00:53:56,626 --> 00:53:57,891
to piss off Frieza!

901
00:54:01,094 --> 00:54:03,095
Next stop, Earth!

902
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:09,133
Ugh!

903
00:54:09,135 --> 00:54:10,901
Oh!

904
00:54:10,903 --> 00:54:11,768
Dad!

905
00:54:12,804 --> 00:54:14,136
Did we make it in time?

906
00:54:14,138 --> 00:54:17,105
Yeah. I mean
it was close, but sure.

907
00:54:17,107 --> 00:54:18,906
You know just once
it might be nice for you

908
00:54:18,908 --> 00:54:21,041
to show up at
the start of the fight.

909
00:54:21,043 --> 00:54:23,710
Yeah, sorry.

910
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:25,645
The guest of honor
is here at last.

911
00:54:25,647 --> 00:54:27,947
I've been waiting such
a long time for you.

912
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:29,648
Hm.

913
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:34,919
I didn't think
I'd see Vegetta here too,

914
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:37,755
but monkeys do travel in troops.

915
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:38,922
All that really matters to me is

916
00:54:38,924 --> 00:54:40,890
I finally get to destroy you.

917
00:54:40,892 --> 00:54:42,958
I thought we were done
with you for good, Frieza.

918
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,893
How did you come back to life?

919
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:47,061
His lackeys used the
Earth's Dragon Balls.

920
00:54:47,063 --> 00:54:50,130
It was about six months ago.
Isn't that right?

921
00:54:50,132 --> 00:54:52,031
It was poetic,
using Earth's dragon

922
00:54:52,033 --> 00:54:53,799
to save me from Earth's Hell.

923
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:56,968
Oh, you can't imagine the
depths of my suffering there.

924
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,636
I spent
most of my days strung up

925
00:54:58,638 --> 00:54:59,937
like a damn pupating moth,

926
00:54:59,939 --> 00:55:02,039
trapped over a field of
delicate little flowers

927
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:03,807
where bands
of angels and fairies

928
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:05,809
and enchanted
stuffed animals lived!

929
00:55:05,811 --> 00:55:07,811
They played songs
and danced asinine jigs

930
00:55:07,813 --> 00:55:12,148
was when they would get
their next warm, fuzzy hug!

931
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,750
Instead of ruling the
Universe with an iron fist,

932
00:55:14,752 --> 00:55:17,152
I was serenaded by teddy bears!

933
00:55:17,953 --> 00:55:20,020
Well don't try
to put that on me, Frieza.

934
00:55:20,022 --> 00:55:22,088
You're the one who came
to Earth looking for a fight.

935
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,223
That's the only reason
Trunks took your life.

936
00:55:24,225 --> 00:55:26,959
I had to come here,
that's what you don't get.

937
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:29,194
Because I'll never be able
to sleep in this Cosmos

938
00:55:29,196 --> 00:55:31,229
knowing that
I share it with you!

939
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:34,732
Your death is my
remedy. That's why I've been

940
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:37,034
training intensively
every day since my return;

941
00:55:37,036 --> 00:55:39,836
To make sure I won't
lose to you again.

942
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:41,704
Having to put a real
effort into anything

943
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:43,238
was a first for me, Goku.

944
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,974
I'll make sure
you suffer for that, too.

945
00:55:50,746 --> 00:55:52,713
You're a lot stronger
now than the last time

946
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:55,115
I saw you, Frieza...
there's no question about that.

947
00:55:55,117 --> 00:55:59,119
And in case you didn't notice,
I've gotten stronger, too.

948
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:00,987
The first time we
fought I made mistakes

949
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:02,621
and you caught me off guard.

950
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:04,122
To ensure that won't
happen I'm going to

951
00:56:04,124 --> 00:56:06,623
take my final form
from the start.

952
00:56:46,258 --> 00:56:48,758
Uh! Holy crap.
That's incredible.

953
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,860
Just what kind of
training did he do?

954
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,829
Guys. This is way
worse than I thought.

955
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:56,898
If there was ever a time to
run for the hills, this is it.

956
00:56:58,267 --> 00:56:59,900
I'll tell ya this,
you're no pushover,

957
00:56:59,902 --> 00:57:02,335
If you weren't rotten
to the core, you'd actually

958
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:04,870
make a perfect
sparring partner for me.

959
00:57:04,872 --> 00:57:06,204
What a waste of talent.

960
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,105
That's just the sort of
small-minded drivel

961
00:57:08,107 --> 00:57:10,807
that makes your
existence so intolerable.

962
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:23,818
Go on. Channel that Super
Saiyan glow I hate so much.

963
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,288
To be honest, Frieza,
I'm not so sure I need to yet.

964
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,856
Well, well, well.

965
00:57:28,858 --> 00:57:31,158
Our monkey's wearing
even bigger britches now.

966
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,859
That's right.

967
00:57:33,393 --> 00:57:35,394
Fine. The black-haired
Goku's pelt

968
00:57:35,396 --> 00:57:38,029
will look just
as good on my wall.

969
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,266
Hm.

970
00:57:56,146 --> 00:57:57,846
Aah...!

971
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:12,224
Yaaah!

972
00:58:48,219 --> 00:58:49,352
How's that possible?

973
00:58:49,354 --> 00:58:50,953
Frieza's more
monstrous than ever,

974
00:58:50,955 --> 00:58:53,088
but Goku hasn't
taken a single blow!

975
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:55,390
I feel like I'm stuck in some
kind of bizarro nightmare.

976
00:58:55,392 --> 00:58:57,392
How can one Earthling
have that much strength?

977
00:58:57,394 --> 00:59:00,093
Well he grew up here,
but he is a Saiyan, you know.

978
00:59:00,095 --> 00:59:01,394
You're obviously joking.

979
00:59:01,396 --> 00:59:03,295
The Saiyans were a
brutal warrior race driven

980
00:59:03,297 --> 00:59:05,897
to extinction...
there can't be one here.

981
00:59:05,899 --> 00:59:08,933
It's true. Actually
my husband's a Saiyan, too.

982
00:59:08,935 --> 00:59:11,235
Two Saiyans?! Ah, come on!

983
00:59:11,237 --> 00:59:12,903
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

984
00:59:12,905 --> 00:59:15,071
It was my job to keep
this world Saiyan-free.

985
00:59:15,073 --> 00:59:17,173
That would be
way too much paperwork.

986
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,534
Take this!

987
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:57,139
Aah!

988
01:00:20,226 --> 01:00:22,426
Seriously?
That's all you've got?

989
01:00:42,344 --> 01:00:43,577
Ooh!

990
01:00:43,579 --> 01:00:45,245
Huh?

991
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,383
Stop! This has
gone on long enough!

992
01:00:51,385 --> 01:00:54,018
You promised me we would
take turns, Kakarot!

993
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,953
Jeez, man! Ow!

994
01:00:55,955 --> 01:00:58,188
I barely got
warmed up, you know!

995
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:03,458
What? Are you
serious, guys? Really?

996
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,427
Oh...

997
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,462
Well how flattering.

998
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,330
No matter how far a pet strays,

999
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:12,398
he still knows
who holds his leash.

1000
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:17,335
Your gesture isn't
lost on me, Vegetta.

1001
01:01:17,337 --> 01:01:20,971
But stay out of this fight.
I want to crush Goku myself.

1002
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:23,173
There, you see? Let me fight
him just a little longer,

1003
01:01:23,175 --> 01:01:25,008
and then we can switch off!

1004
01:01:27,378 --> 01:01:29,078
Hm...

1005
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,981
Hmph. Damn it.

1006
01:01:32,983 --> 01:01:34,482
Hm!

1007
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:36,350
Well this is unexpected.

1008
01:01:36,352 --> 01:01:39,119
I knew a great deal of time
had passed since our battle.

1009
01:01:39,121 --> 01:01:41,087
And I knew you were
the self-improvement type,

1010
01:01:41,089 --> 01:01:43,989
but you've climbed
higher than I thought.

1011
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,024
I tried to warn you, Frieza.

1012
01:01:46,026 --> 01:01:48,059
It's fortunate
I trained so hard,

1013
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:50,227
or I might actually be scared.

1014
01:01:50,229 --> 01:01:52,229
I knew it.

1015
01:01:52,231 --> 01:01:54,496
You've been holding
something back, haven't you?

1016
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:56,464
That's well
deduced for a simpleton.

1017
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:58,566
I've held back just like you.

1018
01:01:58,568 --> 01:02:00,234
Then let's both go all in.

1019
01:02:00,236 --> 01:02:02,536
No more tricks. No reserves.

1020
01:02:02,538 --> 01:02:05,238
Very well, monkeys first.

1021
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,541
Sure about that? I don't
want you to get discouraged.

1022
01:02:08,543 --> 01:02:11,109
But fine, I'll show you.

1023
01:02:17,048 --> 01:02:18,181
They're coming back down.

1024
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:20,183
I can't tell what they're up to.

1025
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,684
What do you think?

1026
01:02:58,653 --> 01:03:01,554
So what is this,
Super Saiyan with blue hair dye?

1027
01:03:01,556 --> 01:03:05,057
It's a little more
complicated than that.

1028
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:07,259
You don't have the patience
for the full story...

1029
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:09,227
so let's say I got a
taste of something called.

1030
01:03:09,229 --> 01:03:11,162
Super Saiyan God,
and now I've learned to

1031
01:03:11,164 --> 01:03:13,330
tap into that power on my own.

1032
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:15,365
Not bad at all, Goku.

1033
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,101
This is just
further vindication.

1034
01:03:18,103 --> 01:03:20,203
If I hadn't evolved
to a new level myself,

1035
01:03:20,205 --> 01:03:23,172
then this might have proven
rather perilous for me.

1036
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,573
I think it's time
you stop talking

1037
01:03:24,575 --> 01:03:26,641
and start showing me, Frieza.

1038
01:04:13,614 --> 01:04:15,615
His power. It's amazing!

1039
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:18,417
What? Frieza has a new form?

1040
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:21,753
I know gold's a bit gauche,
but I wanted to ensure

1041
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:24,756
you grasped my new position
atop the pecking order.

1042
01:04:24,758 --> 01:04:26,457
And for the sake
of your feeble mind,

1043
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:27,758
let's keep the
name simple as well.

1044
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,360
We'll call this "Golden Frieza."

1045
01:04:30,362 --> 01:04:31,594
Of course,
I hope you've realized

1046
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:33,228
this iteration
has far more to it

1047
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:35,263
than a shimmering new facade.

1048
01:04:35,265 --> 01:04:37,331
I noticed. To be honest,
you're more powerful

1049
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:39,232
than I was expecting
as well, Frieza,

1050
01:04:39,234 --> 01:04:42,268
and it's definitely got my heart
beating a few ticks faster.

1051
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:44,303
This is going to be
quite the epic battle,

1052
01:04:44,305 --> 01:04:46,271
my old nemesis.

1053
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:48,372
Sure as hell
won't be an easy one.

1054
01:04:48,374 --> 01:04:51,742
So you want to take that
turn right now, or what?

1055
01:04:51,744 --> 01:04:54,511
Auh! Don't pawn him
off on me now, Kakarot!

1056
01:04:54,513 --> 01:04:57,447
He told us he wanted
to fight you, remember?

1057
01:04:58,683 --> 01:05:01,451
Okay, let's give this a shot.

1058
01:05:58,506 --> 01:05:59,539
Hm.

1059
01:06:01,676 --> 01:06:02,775
Ah!

1060
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,700
Good afternoon!

1061
01:07:12,702 --> 01:07:16,370
Whis and Lord Beerus!
Are you here to help?

1062
01:07:16,372 --> 01:07:18,472
We've come here
for that offering of

1063
01:07:18,474 --> 01:07:19,806
"the strawberry sundae."

1064
01:07:19,808 --> 01:07:22,008
I trust that you've
brought it with you, Bulma?

1065
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,410
Huh? Oh, yeah,
I've still got it.

1066
01:07:24,412 --> 01:07:25,611
It's in Jaco's ship.

1067
01:07:25,613 --> 01:07:27,512
Does it taste
as good as it looks?

1068
01:07:27,514 --> 01:07:29,881
I hope so, since I hate
traveling for nothing.

1069
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:32,683
I'll have to destroy
your planet if it's average.

1070
01:07:32,685 --> 01:07:35,018
Look. It's not a
good time for dessert!

1071
01:07:36,755 --> 01:07:38,988
Eee! Okay, okay,
I'm getting it now!

1072
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:40,489
Just don't blow us
all up if it's

1073
01:07:40,491 --> 01:07:42,456
a little melted, all right?

1074
01:08:03,474 --> 01:08:05,975
Was that too much?
I'm still getting used to this.

1075
01:08:07,912 --> 01:08:10,712
Okay, it's all yours.

1076
01:08:10,714 --> 01:08:14,415
Oh boy! It looks even more
delicious in person!

1077
01:08:14,417 --> 01:08:15,916
Here goes!

1078
01:08:15,918 --> 01:08:17,717
Mm-mm-mmm!

1079
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:20,019
This uses that dairy
concoction known as

1080
01:08:20,021 --> 01:08:22,054
"ice cream" as
its base, correct?

1081
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,756
Interesting. These red
things look like the brains

1082
01:08:24,758 --> 01:08:27,658
of those giant frogs
on Planet Manu.

1083
01:08:29,727 --> 01:08:32,528
Oh no, it's some kind of
fruit! That's even better!

1084
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:33,795
It's such a burst of flavor!

1085
01:08:33,797 --> 01:08:35,563
Try it, Whis. It's great!

1086
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:37,965
Yes I know.
I've already had one.

1087
01:08:37,967 --> 01:08:40,467
This dessert's
simplicity is deceptive.

1088
01:08:40,469 --> 01:08:43,536
Speaking of good,
look at Frieza.

1089
01:08:43,538 --> 01:08:45,571
He's clearly gotten stronger.

1090
01:08:45,573 --> 01:08:48,040
Yes. Goku is
having trouble with him.

1091
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:51,643
Mmm. Oh, Bulma! What is
this sweet, white substance?

1092
01:08:51,645 --> 01:08:54,979
Um, no,
that's just whipped cream.

1093
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:56,547
Ah!

1094
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,549
Look at Vegetta, just watching.

1095
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,984
The Saiyans would win
if they fought as one.

1096
01:09:00,986 --> 01:09:03,853
Yes, if they worked together
they'd clearly be unstoppable,

1097
01:09:03,855 --> 01:09:05,821
but they're far
too proud to do that.

1098
01:09:05,823 --> 01:09:07,455
You mean too stupid.

1099
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:09,823
You said it, not me.

1100
01:09:18,599 --> 01:09:19,864
Hmm.

1101
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:27,470
Damn it. Hate to admit it,
but I'm having some trouble.

1102
01:09:29,474 --> 01:09:31,740
You say that like
it isn't obvious.

1103
01:09:34,678 --> 01:09:35,910
There's no way
around it, Frieza,

1104
01:09:35,912 --> 01:09:39,813
It took me years of blood
and sweat to reach this level,

1105
01:09:39,815 --> 01:09:41,614
but you've caught
up like it's nothing.

1106
01:09:42,817 --> 01:09:44,850
Surely you're not trying
to play on my mercy.

1107
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:46,885
Not even Goku
could be that naive.

1108
01:09:46,887 --> 01:09:49,587
I commend you for
putting up a good struggle.

1109
01:09:49,589 --> 01:09:51,655
But I won't stop until
I've had my revenge

1110
01:09:51,657 --> 01:09:54,124
and you're in far
too many pieces to count!

1111
01:09:55,092 --> 01:09:57,093
Yes. You're so close!

1112
01:09:58,529 --> 01:09:59,861
Uh...!

1113
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,797
What? Beerus?

1114
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:06,733
That not's polite, Frieza,
you forgot to say "Lord."

1115
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:08,735
Lord Beerus,
that's what I meant!

1116
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,670
But, uh, what are
you doing here?

1117
01:10:10,672 --> 01:10:12,638
Well I would have
thought that was obvious.

1118
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,007
I stopped by to eat this
fantastic sundae.

1119
01:10:15,009 --> 01:10:17,709
But... But Lord Beerus,
I came here for vengeance,

1120
01:10:17,711 --> 01:10:19,644
are you planning to intervene?

1121
01:10:19,646 --> 01:10:22,146
Now why would I
possibly care about that?

1122
01:10:22,148 --> 01:10:24,615
You're free to do
as you please, Frieza.

1123
01:10:24,617 --> 01:10:26,917
But just do it farther
away from my ice cream.

1124
01:10:26,919 --> 01:10:30,520
I don't want to confuse your
combat dust for sprinkles.

1125
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:32,889
Then you seriously
didn't come to stop me?

1126
01:10:32,891 --> 01:10:34,991
I just told you
to do as you please.

1127
01:10:34,993 --> 01:10:38,626
I'm a Destroyer god.
I'm not here to take sides.

1128
01:10:38,628 --> 01:10:41,061
Hold on! You mean you'd
really let Frieza win?

1129
01:10:41,063 --> 01:10:43,029
It's not my fight, is it now?

1130
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,063
What're you talking about?

1131
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:46,832
If Frieza wins,
he'll kill us all!

1132
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:51,636
As long as you keep supplying me
with fine delicacies like this,

1133
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:53,771
I'll make sure that your
life is spared, at least.

1134
01:10:53,773 --> 01:10:55,973
You just stay close to me.

1135
01:10:58,642 --> 01:11:01,710
Bulma. Is that actually
Lord Beerus the Destroyer?

1136
01:11:01,712 --> 01:11:04,145
Do you think you can
get a quick picture.

1137
01:11:04,147 --> 01:11:07,815
You're more than welcome
to ask him yourself, Jaco.

1138
01:11:07,817 --> 01:11:10,984
But don't blame me if
the guy disintegrates you.

1139
01:11:10,986 --> 01:11:12,719
Uh, never mind.

1140
01:11:13,587 --> 01:11:16,155
Well, then. Want to pick
which limb I take first

1141
01:11:16,157 --> 01:11:18,023
or shall I surprise you?

1142
01:11:18,025 --> 01:11:19,924
You sure you want to keep going?

1143
01:11:19,926 --> 01:11:23,727
You're better off leaving on a
high note, while you still can.

1144
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:26,730
You just got a new life, and
I'd hate for you to waste it.

1145
01:11:26,732 --> 01:11:29,799
You can't think I'd retreat
with victory so close at hand.

1146
01:11:29,801 --> 01:11:31,801
What sort of fool
do you think I am?

1147
01:11:31,803 --> 01:11:34,670
Kakarot, I'll take
my turn now, if you want.

1148
01:11:34,672 --> 01:11:36,705
Aw, come on! That's not fair!

1149
01:11:36,707 --> 01:11:38,106
The only reason you're
volunteering now is 'cause

1150
01:11:38,108 --> 01:11:39,941
you see his weakness too!

1151
01:11:39,943 --> 01:11:41,943
See my weakness?

1152
01:11:44,981 --> 01:11:47,614
This is truly becoming a farce!

1153
01:11:47,616 --> 01:11:49,015
I hurl you through
cliff sides and you want to

1154
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:51,083
talk about my weakness?

1155
01:11:51,085 --> 01:11:52,584
Fine, I'll play along.

1156
01:11:52,586 --> 01:11:54,852
What is my fatal shortcoming?

1157
01:11:54,854 --> 01:11:59,656
It's not affecting you yet,
Frieza, but it's about to.

1158
01:11:59,658 --> 01:12:03,693
You're too eager for
revenge, that's why you'll fail.

1159
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:05,695
Let me take a wild
guess about your training.

1160
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:07,763
You bolted to Earth
the moment you achieved this

1161
01:12:07,765 --> 01:12:09,798
new golden form
of yours, didn't you?

1162
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,966
And so what if I did?
What's your point?

1163
01:12:11,968 --> 01:12:13,834
Your new form is
burning through more power

1164
01:12:13,836 --> 01:12:15,869
than your body can supply.

1165
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,203
You should've waited
until you were used to

1166
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:18,871
this form and
knew how to regulate it

1167
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:21,106
before you started
picking fights.

1168
01:12:21,108 --> 01:12:24,776
Hm! Is that what you cling to?
Well in that case...

1169
01:12:24,778 --> 01:12:27,812
I'll just stop wasting my time
and kill you right now!

1170
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:10,013
Huh?!

1171
01:13:20,922 --> 01:13:21,888
Eh!

1172
01:14:40,452 --> 01:14:42,453
W-What the...?

1173
01:14:51,963 --> 01:14:54,363
Mmm.

1174
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:56,932
Interesting. The Saiyans'
prediction is coming true,

1175
01:14:56,934 --> 01:14:58,833
and the tables
are starting to turn.

1176
01:14:58,835 --> 01:15:00,367
Did you really think
I wouldn't notice?

1177
01:15:00,369 --> 01:15:03,169
That was my strawberry
you so casually devoured.

1178
01:15:03,171 --> 01:15:04,336
That's a lie and you know it!

1179
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:05,970
How many have you had?

1180
01:15:05,972 --> 01:15:07,271
I've eaten three.

1181
01:15:07,273 --> 01:15:09,206
But I've only had two of them.

1182
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:12,075
Nice try, my lord, but I
know that you've had four.

1183
01:15:12,077 --> 01:15:15,011
There were eight to begin with
and I am capable of math.

1184
01:15:15,013 --> 01:15:16,212
You're forgetting something.

1185
01:15:16,214 --> 01:15:18,214
I am the diety, Whis.

1186
01:15:18,216 --> 01:15:20,049
Eh...

1187
01:15:30,391 --> 01:15:32,225
Ka...

1188
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:38,263
me... ha... me...

1189
01:15:38,265 --> 01:15:38,765
Ha!

1190
01:15:43,101 --> 01:15:46,303
I'll send it back.

1191
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:03,951
Oh yeah!

1192
01:16:23,901 --> 01:16:26,401
See? I told you
you'd run out of gas.

1193
01:16:26,403 --> 01:16:29,103
Now take my advice
and get out of here.

1194
01:16:29,105 --> 01:16:31,205
And live to fight another day.

1195
01:16:33,142 --> 01:16:36,143
I'll be here for a rematch
when you're ready, I promise.

1196
01:16:36,145 --> 01:16:40,947
Damn you!

1197
01:16:40,949 --> 01:16:45,418
Why? Why?

1198
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,253
This shouldn't be happening!

1199
01:16:47,255 --> 01:16:52,157
I am Lord Frieza!

1200
01:17:13,511 --> 01:17:15,110
Huh?

1201
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,028
Exemplary marksmanship, Sorbet.

1202
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:39,397
Uh! Thank you, I live to serve!

1203
01:17:41,467 --> 01:17:44,034
Good thing for contingency
plans, right Goku?

1204
01:17:44,036 --> 01:17:45,568
As if I'd allow even
the slightest chance

1205
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:48,170
of losing to you again!

1206
01:17:57,612 --> 01:17:59,512
Hmmm...

1207
01:18:04,585 --> 01:18:06,585
Goku!

1208
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:16,626
Wake up. Torture's no fun
if I can't hear you scream.

1209
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,501
You know, I did try to
warn Goku this might happen.

1210
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:31,303
Clearly a dirty move
by Frieza, but effective.

1211
01:18:31,305 --> 01:18:32,637
You have to give him that.

1212
01:19:01,262 --> 01:19:03,128
Your obsession
with showing me leniency

1213
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:04,562
borders on the pathological!

1214
01:19:04,564 --> 01:19:06,297
You're too strong
for your own good,

1215
01:19:06,299 --> 01:19:07,631
it's made you overconfident!

1216
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:10,133
A fearless fool who
insists on second chances

1217
01:19:10,135 --> 01:19:12,168
and habitually lowers his guard.

1218
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:14,603
"Here lies one of the
strongest mortals in the Cosmos,

1219
01:19:14,605 --> 01:19:16,638
felled by a common ray gun!"

1220
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,472
How pitiful does that feel?

1221
01:19:20,142 --> 01:19:22,542
Now you're the one on
the ground facing defeat.

1222
01:19:22,544 --> 01:19:25,144
You won the battle
but then you lost the war.

1223
01:19:25,146 --> 01:19:27,412
And the dream I clung to
in that damned cocoon

1224
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:29,580
is finally at hand!

1225
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:33,116
Now to pick the
fruit of my labor...

1226
01:19:33,118 --> 01:19:34,550
the fruit called revenge!

1227
01:19:38,122 --> 01:19:40,088
Ooh, now there's
an interesting thought.

1228
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:43,324
We could make this moment
so much more delectable!

1229
01:19:43,326 --> 01:19:47,127
Oh, Vegetta,
come down here for a second!

1230
01:19:47,129 --> 01:19:49,062
Wouldn't you like to do it?

1231
01:19:49,064 --> 01:19:51,097
I know you despise
this Saiyan underling

1232
01:19:51,099 --> 01:19:52,598
for daring to be so uppity.

1233
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,533
So I'll let you kill him
to prove you've realized

1234
01:19:54,535 --> 01:19:58,136
your folly and re-pledge your
loyalty, like the old days.

1235
01:19:58,138 --> 01:20:00,438
Do it and
I'll spare you, at least.

1236
01:20:08,145 --> 01:20:09,311
Vegetta, no!

1237
01:20:09,313 --> 01:20:11,446
Shut your mouth, woman!

1238
01:20:15,383 --> 01:20:18,184
Hey. I really
botched this one, huh?

1239
01:20:21,187 --> 01:20:23,321
Whis tried to warn you
and yet here you are.

1240
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:26,424
I guess you always
will be a naive idiot.

1241
01:20:26,426 --> 01:20:28,259
Thanks for the offer,
but I can't.

1242
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:32,463
It's our rivalry that keeps
pushing me to get stronger.

1243
01:20:32,465 --> 01:20:34,465
I can't afford to kill him.

1244
01:20:34,467 --> 01:20:37,434
What if I sweeten the deal?

1245
01:20:37,436 --> 01:20:39,202
Take Goku's life
and I'll appoint you

1246
01:20:39,204 --> 01:20:41,604
the Supreme Commander
of the entire Frieza Force.

1247
01:20:41,606 --> 01:20:44,440
Of course I know at the moment
it only consists of Sorbet,

1248
01:20:44,442 --> 01:20:47,209
but we'll rebuild it
stronger than ever!

1249
01:20:47,211 --> 01:20:49,344
You would make me
your Supreme Commander?

1250
01:20:49,346 --> 01:20:50,678
Is that a real offer?

1251
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,281
Should I take that as a "yes"?

1252
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:57,684
Damn it. Now I may
actually regret this...

1253
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,619
Huh...?

1254
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,721
But I've already
made my decision.

1255
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:05,224
I'm going to pulverize you
until there's nothing left.

1256
01:21:05,226 --> 01:21:07,392
Ah! You dare say that to me?

1257
01:21:07,394 --> 01:21:09,494
Use your head. Do you
actually think I would

1258
01:21:09,496 --> 01:21:11,696
stay loyal to you
after you blew up the planet

1259
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:13,431
I was destined to rule?

1260
01:21:15,134 --> 01:21:16,633
Well, I wonder what the
prince would do if he knew

1261
01:21:16,635 --> 01:21:19,669
you authorized Planet Vegetta's
destruction from the start?

1262
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:22,171
Shh! Keep that under wraps!

1263
01:21:22,173 --> 01:21:23,372
Get down here, Krillin.

1264
01:21:23,374 --> 01:21:25,474
Your buddy Kakarot
needs a Senzu Bean.

1265
01:21:25,476 --> 01:21:27,309
He's fading fast.

1266
01:21:27,311 --> 01:21:29,511
Okay, I'm coming!

1267
01:21:29,513 --> 01:21:31,646
Oh, I don't think so!

1268
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:36,650
What the...?!

1269
01:21:50,397 --> 01:21:53,198
He's wasn't kidding.
You're in bad shape.

1270
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,567
Good thing that
space cop didn't want his.

1271
01:21:58,671 --> 01:22:03,206
Thanks, Vegetta.
You really saved my neck!

1272
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:05,541
Ha! You can thank me by
staying out of this fight

1273
01:22:05,543 --> 01:22:07,676
from now on. I'm finishing this!

1274
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:11,279
Yeah, of course! It's your
turn anyway. Have fun!

1275
01:22:16,717 --> 01:22:18,817
Please. If you believe
you can defeat me,

1276
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:21,286
then you're more
delusional than ever!

1277
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:48,846
That's right.
You had no idea, did you?

1278
01:22:48,848 --> 01:22:52,583
I've been a Super
Saiyan for years, and now...

1279
01:22:52,585 --> 01:22:55,518
I too have the power of a god.

1280
01:23:05,427 --> 01:23:06,927
Uh!

1281
01:23:12,766 --> 01:23:14,967
You of all people
should know this about me.

1282
01:23:14,969 --> 01:23:18,503
But I don't share Kakarot's
taste for forgiveness.

1283
01:23:18,505 --> 01:23:20,771
I'm sending you back to Hell.

1284
01:23:20,773 --> 01:23:24,508
Ha, ha. Your threats
are as empty as your title.

1285
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:27,511
All hail Vegetta,
prince of no one!

1286
01:24:06,909 --> 01:24:11,745
No, this can't be real!
This is not the way this ends!

1287
01:24:15,749 --> 01:24:18,617
At least try to face
your death with some honor.

1288
01:24:21,588 --> 01:24:24,455
And don't dream of
resurrecting again.

1289
01:24:27,725 --> 01:24:30,626
You can all go
to Hell without me!

1290
01:24:30,628 --> 01:24:31,994
What?!

1291
01:24:47,777 --> 01:24:49,477
Uh-oh. Whis, quickly!

1292
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:50,811
Right!

1293
01:25:25,545 --> 01:25:28,780
No. How could
anyone be that evil?

1294
01:25:28,782 --> 01:25:31,649
There's nothing left.
He destroyed the Earth!

1295
01:25:32,952 --> 01:25:39,756
Vegetta. Trunks. Mom
and Dad. They're all gone.

1296
01:25:39,758 --> 01:25:41,691
No. That heartless tyrant.

1297
01:25:41,693 --> 01:25:44,727
He couldn't just die. He took
the whole planet with him.

1298
01:25:44,729 --> 01:25:46,462
You're wrong.

1299
01:25:46,464 --> 01:25:48,897
I'm afraid Frieza
is most likely alive.

1300
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:52,834
His species is able to
surviving in a vacuum.

1301
01:25:52,836 --> 01:25:55,703
Tactically speaking, that was
a pretty ingenious move.

1302
01:25:55,705 --> 01:25:58,605
It's not fair.
He took everything!

1303
01:25:58,607 --> 01:26:00,607
The Dragon Balls
were destroyed as well,

1304
01:26:00,609 --> 01:26:02,108
so we can't even summon Shenron.

1305
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:05,077
There's no way we can
reverse what Frieza's done.

1306
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:07,112
This is my fault.

1307
01:26:07,114 --> 01:26:08,947
Damn! Frieza was right about me!

1308
01:26:08,949 --> 01:26:11,649
I should have finished him
off when I had the chance!

1309
01:26:11,651 --> 01:26:14,585
Agreed. Then are you
ready to make this right?

1310
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:15,686
Huh?

1311
01:26:15,688 --> 01:26:16,987
You failed to
protect your planet

1312
01:26:16,989 --> 01:26:18,722
because of your own leniency.

1313
01:26:18,724 --> 01:26:20,123
The only way to
avoid this outcome

1314
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:22,925
is to send Frieza back
to his flower garden.

1315
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,727
What? But isn't it
too late for that?

1316
01:26:27,896 --> 01:26:31,732
Not quite. I can
turn back time, remember?

1317
01:26:31,734 --> 01:26:36,002
Three minutes is as far back
as I'm able to manage.

1318
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:38,137
That do-over thing...

1319
01:26:38,139 --> 01:26:39,738
Temporal Do-Over.

1320
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,073
You actually paid
attention for once!

1321
01:26:58,558 --> 01:27:02,959
No, this can't be real!
This is not the way this ends!

1322
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:09,865
At least try to face
your death with some honor.

1323
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:15,704
And don't even dream
of resurrecting again.

1324
01:27:18,974 --> 01:27:21,909
You can all go
to Hell without me!

1325
01:27:21,911 --> 01:27:23,844
Frieza!

1326
01:27:23,846 --> 01:27:25,679
What? No!

1327
01:27:25,681 --> 01:27:26,181
Ha!

1328
01:27:38,658 --> 01:27:43,860
Damn you, Goku!

1329
01:28:00,741 --> 01:28:02,875
Whew, I guess we're safe now.

1330
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:05,644
Selfish glory-hog!
Do you have any shame?

1331
01:28:05,646 --> 01:28:06,945
Hey, just take it easy, Vegetta.

1332
01:28:06,947 --> 01:28:08,579
It's not what it looks like.

1333
01:28:08,581 --> 01:28:09,813
I can explain, okay?

1334
01:28:09,815 --> 01:28:11,214
Oh no, you're not
smooth-talking your way

1335
01:28:11,216 --> 01:28:12,682
out of this one, Kakarot!

1336
01:28:12,684 --> 01:28:13,983
You told me it was my turn!

1337
01:28:13,985 --> 01:28:16,085
It's all right, Vegetta!

1338
01:28:16,087 --> 01:28:18,087
Goku just saved you
and the whole world!

1339
01:28:18,089 --> 01:28:19,855
You should be thanking him!

1340
01:28:19,857 --> 01:28:22,123
What does she mean?
Saved the world from what?

1341
01:28:22,125 --> 01:28:23,824
I want answers!

1342
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,229
That's right, we time-traveled.

1343
01:28:30,231 --> 01:28:31,830
I was worried about you, Dad.

1344
01:28:31,832 --> 01:28:33,698
Just don't
call me funny-looking, okay?

1345
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:34,965
Well who would have thought?

1346
01:28:34,967 --> 01:28:36,900
I'm not sure
I can live this down.

1347
01:28:36,902 --> 01:28:39,869
What sort of Destroyer helps
bring a world back to life?

1348
01:28:39,871 --> 01:28:41,837
We can't thank you
enough. And don't worry,

1349
01:28:41,839 --> 01:28:43,238
you'll get plenty
of food out of this.

1350
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,939
We'll throw you a huge feast.

1351
01:28:44,941 --> 01:28:46,707
Right after we
track down the Dragon Balls

1352
01:28:46,709 --> 01:28:48,909
and put North City
back together, that is.

1353
01:28:48,911 --> 01:28:50,710
I look forward to it greatly.

1354
01:28:50,712 --> 01:28:52,678
That is the real reason
I turned back time

1355
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,613
to save your world, you know.

1356
01:28:54,615 --> 01:28:56,681
You sure you don't
want to arrest him?

1357
01:28:56,683 --> 01:28:59,684
Manipulating time is
a serious Galactic offense.

1358
01:28:59,686 --> 01:29:02,953
Oh, my official response is
that I didn't see anything.

1359
01:29:05,756 --> 01:29:08,124
Keep walking. I'm not
going to thank you.

1360
01:29:08,126 --> 01:29:09,859
This just means we're even.

1361
01:29:09,861 --> 01:29:11,994
Take it easy, I didn't
come to talk about that.

1362
01:29:11,996 --> 01:29:13,895
I'm just curious what
you think about Whis saying

1363
01:29:13,897 --> 01:29:16,063
if we'd team up in these
battles then people like Frieza

1364
01:29:16,065 --> 01:29:18,131
wouldn't even have
the chance to knock us out.

1365
01:29:18,133 --> 01:29:19,765
Should we practice
fighting together

1366
01:29:19,767 --> 01:29:21,833
in case we need to sometime?

1367
01:29:21,835 --> 01:29:24,869
Hmph. I'd rather die
than ever do that again.

1368
01:29:26,672 --> 01:29:29,773
Glad to hear it, Vegetta.
I feel the same way!

1369
01:29:29,775 --> 01:29:32,709
'Bout time
we agree on something.

1370
01:33:39,086 --> 01:33:43,021
Welcome home!

1371
01:33:43,422 --> 01:33:46,090
No!

1372
01:33:46,092 --> 01:33:50,326
- Yay!
- No!

1373
01:33:51,305 --> 01:34:51,320
