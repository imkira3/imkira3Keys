1
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:07,828
One con under escort.
Open gate one.

2
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:12,708
Man walking.

3
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:15,504
Open gate two.

4
00:00:20,049 --> 00:00:24,220
Let's go. Face the wall.
Got one under escort.

5
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:42,822
- Good morning.
- Morning.

6
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,617
- State your name for the record.
- Daniel Ocean.

7
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:50,788
Thank you. The purpose of this
hearing is to determine ...

8
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:54,125
whether you are
likely to break the law again.

9
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,796
This was your first conviction,
but you've been implicated ...

10
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,924
in a dozen other schemes
and frauds.

11
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,677
What can you tell us about this?

12
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:08,472
As you say, ma'am,
I was never charged.

13
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:11,559
We're trying to find out ...

14
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,687
if there was a reason
for committing this crime ...

15
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:17,857
or just a reason
you got caught this time.

16
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:22,945
My wife left me. I was upset.
I got into a self-destructive pattern.

17
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:28,743
If released, is it likely you'd fall
back into a similar pattern?

18
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:33,497
She left me once. I doubt
she'd do it again just for kicks.

19
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:39,378
Mr. Ocean, what do you think
you would do if released?

20
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,839
- Chips, please.
- Sure.

21
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:11,303
- Change 150. Quarters or nickels?
- Quarters are fine.

22
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:16,767
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,528
20. Dealer has 19.
Good start.

24
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:35,369
- I'm going on break now.
- Here. Thank you very much.

25
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:39,498
- Good luck.
- You have a good one.

26
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,335
- How are you, sir?
- Hello, Frank.

27
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:51,969
I beg your pardon. You must have me
confused with someone else.

28
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:55,973
My name is Ramón.
As you can see right here.

29
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:02,188
- My mistake.
- No problem, sir.

30
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:05,107
The table's cold anyway.

31
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:09,862
You might want to try the lounge
at Caesars. Gets busy after 1:00.

32
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:11,906
- 1:00?
- Yes, sir.

33
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,575
Thanks, Ramón.

34
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:17,328
Thank you.

35
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:30,716
- Checking up on current events?
- Ramón?

36
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:35,888
Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
can't get past the gaming board.

37
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:38,516
- You just got out?
- This afternoon.

38
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,101
You seen him?

39
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:45,439
I heard he was teaching movie stars
how to play cards. Why?

40
00:04:46,107 --> 00:04:47,775
You have a plan already?

41
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:51,237
Are you kidding?
I just became a citizen again.

42
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:52,780
Officer Brooks ...

43
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:57,743
this is Danny Ocean. I was told
to contact you within 24 hours.

44
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:01,956
No, sir, I haven't
been getting in trouble.

45
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:06,085
No, sir, I haven't been drinking.

46
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:09,547
No, sir, I wouldn't even think
about leaving the state.

47
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:27,314
Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man?

48
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:34,572
Let me ask you a question.
Are you incorporated?

49
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:38,576
You should think about it.
I talked to my manager ...

50
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:42,538
- Bernie?
- Not Bernie. My business manager.

51
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:45,499
Actually, they're both named Bernie.

52
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:49,879
He said what we do could
be considered research ...

53
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:54,133
for a future gig, so I could
make it a tax write-off.

54
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:58,220
The one thing is, and this is
his thing and it's stupid ...

55
00:05:58,429 --> 00:06:01,432
but I'd have to pay you by check.

56
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:09,023
Or we could just stick to cash.

57
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:11,692
Yeah, let's just stick to cash.

58
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:23,454
We'll begin with five-card draw.
Everyone remember that?

59
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:26,540
Who wants to start us out? Josh?

60
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:31,378
Josh. To the left.

61
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:33,172
Deal to your left.

62
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,965
- Shane?
- Hit me.

63
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:37,885
- It's not blackjack.
- Dude!

64
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:43,557
Looking at them doesn't change them.
You know what you have.

65
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:46,519
- Left. Left.
- Left, I'll get it.

66
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,896
Lady bets. Let's keep it moving.

67
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,565
- Blue.
- Blue, that's a 50.

68
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:53,484
- I'll call?
- Okay.

69
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,861
Shane's calling. 50.

70
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,864
What the hell, it's only
pocket change.

71
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:02,827
That's your business.
Pretend it's for a reason.

72
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:04,412
Yeah, thanks, man.

73
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,831
- Right.
- How many?

74
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,001
- Four.
- You don't want four. You wanna fold.

75
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:12,962
- I wanna fold?
- Fold.

76
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:14,588
Is that good?

77
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,175
You're done. Let's take that.
You're done.

78
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,679
You're done.
You have three pairs.

79
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:25,433
You can't have six cards
in a five-card game.

80
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:27,810
- Maybe one was mine.
- Wasn't me.

81
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,103
Fellas!

82
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:32,440
All reds.

83
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:35,359
What up, dog?

84
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,536
I'm gonna love spending your money.
I'm gonna get my car washed.

85
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:03,095
- How's the game going?
- Longest hour of my life.

86
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:06,974
- What?
- I'm running away with your wife.

87
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:08,934
Great.

88
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:22,114
Isn't that hard, crossing over
from television to film?

89
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:24,283
Not for me, dude.

90
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,162
Hey, Russ. We got another player ...

91
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,414
if that's cool with you.

92
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,629
What do you do for a living?
If you don't mind me asking.

93
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:39,090
Why would I mind you asking?

94
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,716
Two cards.

95
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:43,469
I just got out of prison.

96
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:48,182
- Really?
- Why were you in prison?

97
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,810
I stole things.

98
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:54,522
You stole things?
Like jewels?

99
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:58,067
Incan matrimonial head masks.

100
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:03,072
- Any money in Incan matrimonial ...?
- Head masks. Some.

101
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,326
Don't let him fool you.
There's loads if you can move them.

102
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:10,996
I'll take one. But you can't.

103
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:14,333
- My fence was confident.
- You don't need a fence.

104
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:18,087
- Some people lack vision.
- Everybody in cellblock E.

105
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:20,089
That's $500.

106
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,677
- What's the first lesson in poker?
- Never bet on the ...

107
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:27,513
- Leave emotion at the door.
- Right, Topher.

108
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:30,558
Today's lesson:
How to draw out the bluff.

109
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:32,935
That much money, this early ...

110
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:36,605
He has nothing better than
a pair of face cards.

111
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:38,274
Barry?

112
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:42,570
All right.

113
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:44,822
I fold.

114
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:49,493
- Josh?
- Don't worry, I'm game.

115
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:54,457
I will see your $500
and I will raise you another ...

116
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:58,502
$500 of my own.
- That's a very handsome bet.

117
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:04,383
But don't push him too high, too fast.
Keep him on the leash.

118
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,594
- Holly?
- Call.

119
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,763
Call.

120
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:11,307
And I'll call.

121
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:18,647
I'll see your $500
and raise you $2,000.

122
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:22,818
Guys, you do what you like.
That's a lot of money.

123
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:28,240
I'm staying in. He's trying to buy
his way out of his bluff.

124
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:32,286
- Josh?
- Two.

125
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,043
Thattagirl. Call.

126
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:42,254
- Call.
- Call.

127
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,884
Let's see them.

128
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:52,973
I'm not sure what four nines does,
but the ace, I think, is pretty high.

129
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,393
Thanks for the tip on bluffing.

130
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:01,982
Hey, Topher! How about an autograph?
Come on, real quick.

131
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:21,585
- God, I'm bored.
- You look bored.

132
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:26,048
How was the clink?
You get the cookies I sent?

133
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:29,552
Why do you think
I came to see you first?

134
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:32,721
- So tell me.
- It's tricky.

135
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:37,601
It's never been done before.
It'll need planning and a large crew.

136
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,897
- Guns?
- Not quite. High security. The take ...

137
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:44,191
- The target?
- Eight figures.

138
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,318
What's the target?

139
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:50,948
When was the last time
you were in Vegas?

140
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:53,951
You want to knock over a casino?

141
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:09,216
The vault at the Bellagio.

142
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:18,058
If I'm reading this right,
and I'd like to think I am ...

143
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:23,022
this is probably the least
accessible vault ever designed.

144
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:26,150
You said three casinos?

145
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,364
These feed into the Mirage and MGM
Grand, but every dime ends up there.

146
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,910
The Bellagio and the Mirage.

147
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:40,289
- These are Terry Benedict's places.
- Yes, they are.

148
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:43,375
- Think he'll mind?
- More than somewhat.

149
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:47,671
You'd need at least 12 guys
doing a combination of cons.

150
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,548
Like what, you think?

151
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:55,012
Off the top of my head, I'd say you're
looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown ...

152
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,640
a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks.

153
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,769
Not to mention the biggest
Ella Fitzgerald ever.

154
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:04,855
Where will you get
the money to back this?

155
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:08,192
Hit these three casinos,
we'll get our bankroll.

156
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:10,820
Benedict's got a list of enemies.

157
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,907
But enemies with loose
cash and nothing to lose?

158
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,703
- Reuben.
- Reuben.

159
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:21,414
Hey.

160
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:25,084
Oscar, lower it a bit,
would you?

161
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:28,671
Sorry. You guys done?
Find what you want?

162
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,966
We'll take these for the night
to make copies.

163
00:13:32,174 --> 00:13:35,177
- Whatever you need.
- Appreciate it.

164
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:43,936
What?

165
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,022
I need a reason.

166
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:50,276
And don't say money. Why do this?

167
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:52,611
Why not do it?

168
00:13:57,742 --> 00:14:01,579
I just left the joint after
losing four years of my life ...

169
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:04,874
and you're cold-decking
Teen Beat cover boys.

170
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:09,003
Because the house always wins.

171
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:12,381
Play long enough,
the house takes you.

172
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:18,304
Unless, when that perfect hand comes,
you bet big. Then you take the house.

173
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:24,101
- You practiced that speech?
- Did I rush it?

174
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:26,812
It was good.
The Teen Beat thing was harsh.

175
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,943
I wonder what Reuben will say.

176
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:36,530
You're out of your damn minds!

177
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:40,034
You're both of you nuts!

178
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:45,706
I know more about casino security
than any man. I invented it.

179
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:47,792
And it cannot be beaten.

180
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,170
They got cameras and watchers,
they got locks.

181
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:53,214
They got timers, vaults.

182
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:57,009
They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris!

183
00:14:58,052 --> 00:15:00,262
Okay, bad example.

184
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:02,223
It's never been tried.

185
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:07,853
It's been tried.
A few guys even came close.

186
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:11,774
You know the three most successful
robberies in Vegas?

187
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,984
Number three, the bronze medal.

188
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:17,321
Pencil neck grabs
a lockbox at the Horseshoe.

189
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,824
Grab the guy in the suit!

190
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:24,370
He got two steps closer
to the door than anyone before.

191
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:25,746
Leave the money!

192
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,915
Second most successful robbery:

193
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:32,628
The Flamingo in '71. This guy
actually tasted fresh oxygen ...

194
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:34,880
before they grabbed him.

195
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,885
Of course, he was breathing out
of a hose for the next three weeks.

196
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:41,887
Goddamn hippie.

197
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:47,476
And the closest any man has come
to robbing a Las Vegas casino ...

198
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:50,938
was outside of Caesars in '87.

199
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:53,107
He came ...

200
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,443
he grabbed ...

201
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:58,154
they conquered.

202
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:07,955
But what am I saying?
You guys are pros. The best.

203
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,250
I'm sure you can make
it out of the casino.

204
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,711
Of course, lest we forget ...

205
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,216
once you're out, you're still
in the middle of the fucking desert!

206
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,135
You're right.
He's right.

207
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:24,138
Our eyes were bigger
than our stomachs.

208
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:27,516
- That's what it is. Ego.
- Yeah, blah, blah.

209
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,728
- Thanks for lunch.
- The nicoise was delicious.

210
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:34,106
- Sorry to bother you.
- Look, we go way back ...

211
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:37,818
and I owe you from the thing
with the guy.

212
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:40,488
- Our pleasure.
- I'd never been to Belize.

213
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:45,659
Give Dominic your addresses.
I got some furniture to send you.

214
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:52,750
Just out of curiosity, which casinos
did you geniuses pick to rob?

215
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:57,338
The Bellagio, the Mirage
and the MGM Grand.

216
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:02,635
Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.

217
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:05,221
- Is that right?
- That's right.

218
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,890
You guys ...

219
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:11,769
what do you got against
Terry Benedict?

220
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:15,648
What do you have against him?
That's the question.

221
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:20,611
He torpedoed my casino.
Muscled me out.

222
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:26,158
Now he's gonna blow it up next month
to make way for some monstrosity.

223
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:30,037
- I see what you're doing.
- What are we doing?

224
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:35,960
If you're gonna steal from Terry
Benedict, you better goddamn know.

225
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,297
This used to be civilized.
You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you.

226
00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:42,383
But Benedict ...

227
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:47,263
At the end of it, he'd better not
know you're involved.

228
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:52,309
Because he'll kill you,
then he'll go to work on you.

229
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:56,814
That's why we have to be
very careful, very precise.

230
00:17:57,064 --> 00:17:58,441
Well-funded.

231
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,569
You gotta be nuts, too.

232
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:06,073
And you're gonna need
a crew as nuts as you are.

233
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,203
Who do you got in mind?

234
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:14,707
- All right, who 's in?
- Frank C. Is in.

235
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:21,380
Frank has bronchitis and is applying
for a transfer to warmer climates.

236
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:28,179
Drivers?

237
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,931
- I talked to the Malloys.
- Mormon twins?

238
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,601
They're in Utah, off the job.

239
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:37,313
They're having
trouble filling the hours.

240
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,997
- Waiting, sweetheart.
- Good. Go.

241
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:56,582
- Waiting for you.
- Why?

242
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,667
- You're a little girl!
- Relax.

243
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:03,464
I'm going to get out and
drop you like third-period French.

244
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:05,007
Relax.

245
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:45,172
- Electronics?
- Livingston Dell.

246
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:49,510
He's been doing surveillance
work for the FBI mob squad.

247
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,096
- How are his nerves?
- Not so bad.

248
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:54,640
Move in a little bit.

249
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,312
- Don't touch that.
- Why not?

250
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:04,942
Do you see me grabbing your gun
and waving it around?

251
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:07,737
Hey, RadioShack. Relax.

252
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:18,789
Munitions.

253
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:21,041
- Phil Turrentine.
- Dead.

254
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,711
- No shit. On the job?
- Skin cancer.

255
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,298
- You send flowers?
- Dated his wife for a while.

256
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:29,675
Basher's in town.

257
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:33,304
There may be an issue
with availability.

258
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,270
All right, chaps ...

259
00:20:42,563 --> 00:20:44,523
hang on to your knickers.

260
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,919
Oh, leave it out!

261
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:10,758
You tossers!
You had one job to do!

262
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:17,348
That's all you used in the event?

263
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:20,893
- You accusing me of booby-trapping?
- Well?

264
00:21:21,102 --> 00:21:25,272
Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
Isn't that right?

265
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:27,233
Basher?

266
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,610
Peck. ATF.

267
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:31,654
Let me venture a guess.

268
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:37,326
Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound,
quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.

269
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:40,955
Let me ask you this.
You search this scumbag ...

270
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:44,291
for booby traps?
I mean, really searched.

271
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,043
Stand back.

272
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:47,920
Here we go.

273
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:50,714
- Find Griggs. I need him.
- Who?

274
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,883
Just find him, will you?

275
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:57,930
Can you put something together
with what I gave you?

276
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,348
Done.

277
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:03,894
- Is Danny about?
- He's around the corner.

278
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:08,065
Terrific. It'll be nice working
with proper villains again.

279
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:10,693
Everybody down! Get down!

280
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:15,030
They weren't expecting that shit!

281
00:22:15,406 --> 00:22:16,991
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

282
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:40,055
- Which one's the Amazing Yen?
- The little Chinese guy.

283
00:22:44,518 --> 00:22:47,563
- Who else is on the list?
- He is the list.

284
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:54,195
It doesn't seem that diff ...

285
00:23:03,537 --> 00:23:07,625
- We got a grease man.
- We got a grease man.

286
00:23:11,587 --> 00:23:12,922
We need Saul.

287
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,009
- He got out of the game a year ago.
- He get religion?

288
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:19,011
Ulcers.

289
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:24,266
- You could ask him.
- Hey, I could ask him.

290
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:55,089
I saw you at the paddock ...

291
00:23:55,423 --> 00:24:00,428
before the second race, outside
the men's room when I placed my bet.

292
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,807
I saw you before you even
got up this morning.

293
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:08,436
- How you been, Saul?
- Never better.

294
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:10,563
What's with the orange?

295
00:24:10,771 --> 00:24:15,359
- My doctor says I need vitamins.
- Why don't you take vitamins?

296
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:18,195
You come here to give me a physical?

297
00:24:18,404 --> 00:24:20,614
Box seats. Come on.

298
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:37,757
You gonna tell me? Or should I
say no and get it over with?

299
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:41,552
You're the best. You're in
Cooperstown. What do you want?

300
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:44,472
Nothing. I got a duplex now.

301
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,475
I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish.

302
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:51,437
I'm seeing a lady who works
the counter at Macy's.

303
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:53,606
I've changed.

304
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,781
Guys like us don't change.
We stay sharp or get sloppy.

305
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,991
Quit conning me.

306
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:06,619
That your hound way in the rear?

307
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:09,663
He breaks late.
Everyone knows this.

308
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,587
You going to treat me
like a grownup at least?

309
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:19,090
Tell me what the scam is?

310
00:25:49,036 --> 00:25:52,623
Exhibit C: His belt as king
of the heavyweight crown.

311
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:57,002
Lennox Lewis has proven
he's the champion.

312
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:02,383
Saul makes 10.
Ten should do it, don't you think?

313
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:05,553
You think we need one more?

314
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:09,515
You think we need one more.

315
00:26:10,474 --> 00:26:12,852
All right, we'll get one more.

316
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:34,141
Hello, Linus. Whose is this?

317
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:38,646
- Who are you?
- A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.

318
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:43,317
You're either in or out.
Right now.

319
00:27:46,237 --> 00:27:50,366
- What is it?
- It's a plane ticket. A job offer.

320
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:55,329
- You're pretty trusting.
- Bobby has faith in you.

321
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,873
Fathers are like that.

322
00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:02,044
He didn't tell you? He doesn't
want me trading on his name.

323
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:05,131
Do this job,
he'll be trading on yours.

324
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:08,884
Don't, and you can go back
to feeling up stockbrokers.

325
00:28:09,093 --> 00:28:11,470
Can you get the check, please?

326
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:16,892
That's the best lift you've made yet.

327
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,978
Las Vegas?

328
00:28:19,186 --> 00:28:20,896
America's playground.

329
00:29:06,817 --> 00:29:10,029
Did you guys get a group rate,
or something?

330
00:29:16,327 --> 00:29:18,829
Saul, do you get out to Utah much?

331
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:22,750
Not as often as I'd like.

332
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:27,963
Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo.
You could do well there.

333
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:30,091
I'll look into it.

334
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:35,721
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Has everybody eaten? Good.

335
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:37,973
Everybody sober?

336
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:43,020
Close enough. Before we start,
nobody's on the line yet.

337
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,858
What I'm about to propose is highly
lucrative and highly dangerous.

338
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:50,820
If that's not your brand of vodka ...

339
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:55,783
eat as much as you like and have
a safe journey. No hard feelings.

340
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:57,743
Otherwise, come with me.

341
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:09,296
You're Bobby Caldwell's kid?

342
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,717
- From Chicago?
- Yeah.

343
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:17,263
- You like it there?
- Yeah.

344
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:21,517
That's wonderful.
Get in the goddamn house.

345
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:34,155
The 3000 block
of Las Vegas Boulevard ...

346
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,908
also known as the Bellagio,
Mirage and MGM Grand.

347
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,329
They're three of the most
profitable casinos in Las Vegas.

348
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:47,543
This is the Bellagio vault, located ...

349
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:50,504
beneath 200 feet of solid earth.

350
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:55,801
It safeguards every dime that passes
through each of the three casinos.

351
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,096
- We're gonna rob it.
- Smash-and-grab job?

352
00:30:59,346 --> 00:31:01,766
Slightly more complicated than that.

353
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,101
Well, yeah.

354
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:09,940
This is courtesy of Frank Catton,
a new dealer at the Bellagio.

355
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:11,609
Bad news first.

356
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:16,155
This place houses a security system
rivaling most nuclear silos.

357
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:21,452
First, we have to get in the casino
cages, which takes more than a smile.

358
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,163
Next, through these doors ...

359
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:28,834
each one requiring a different
code changed every 12 hours.

360
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:32,755
Past those, the elevator.
Here's where it gets tricky.

361
00:31:32,963 --> 00:31:37,635
- It won't move without fingerprint I.D.
- Which we can't fake.

362
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:42,848
And vocal confirmation from the system
within the Bellagio and the vault.

363
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:44,600
Which we won't get.

364
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:47,853
The elevator shaft is rigged
with sensors.

365
00:31:48,062 --> 00:31:52,900
If we override the lift, the exit
would lock and we'd be trapped.

366
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,529
Once we get down the shaft,
it's a piece of cake.

367
00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:00,116
Just two more guards with Uzis ...

368
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:04,120
and the most elaborate
vault door ever conceived.

369
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:06,414
Any questions?

370
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:11,085
Tunneling's out. There are ...

371
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:16,173
sensors monitoring the ground.
If a groundhog nested, they'd know.

372
00:32:16,757 --> 00:32:19,677
- Anyone else?
- You mentioned good news?

373
00:32:19,885 --> 00:32:23,264
Yeah. The Nevada Gaming
Commission requires ...

374
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:28,060
a casino to keep enough cash
to cover every chip on the floor.

375
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:32,106
That means on a weekday, by law,
it must carry ...

376
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:35,192
between $60 and $70 million
in cash and coin.

377
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:39,572
On the weekend, between 80
and 90 million. On a fight night ...

378
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,867
in two weeks,
the night we're robbing it ...

379
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:46,454
$150 million,
without breaking a sweat.

380
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:50,708
There are 11 of us,
each with an equal share.

381
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,543
You do the math.

382
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:54,211
Exactly.

383
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,796
I have a question.

384
00:32:56,338 --> 00:33:00,426
Say we get into the cage
and through the security doors ...

385
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:03,012
down the elevator
we can't move ...

386
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,391
past the guards with the guns,
into the vault we can't open ...

387
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:12,229
- Without being seen by cameras.
- Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

388
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,149
Yeah, well, say we do all that ...

389
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:20,029
we're just supposed to walk out
of there with $150 million ...

390
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:22,782
without getting stopped?

391
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:29,080
Yeah.

392
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:34,502
Oh. Okay.

393
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:45,679
First task: Reconnaissance.
I want to know what goes on ...

394
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:48,766
in all casinos,
from the dealers ' rotation ...

395
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:55,022
to the path of cash carts. I want
to know everything about every guard.

396
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,445
Find out where they're from,
nicknames, how they take their coffee.

397
00:34:01,737 --> 00:34:04,865
She dances at Crazy Horse Too,
to pay for school.

398
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:08,327
- I think she really likes me.
- Cool.

399
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:17,461
Know these casinos.
They were built to keep people in.

400
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,463
Know the quick routes out.

401
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:23,259
- He went through at 10:44.
- 10:46. Get a watch that works.

402
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:27,012
- You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44.
- 10:46.

403
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,644
Second task: Power.

404
00:34:34,186 --> 00:34:38,691
Fight night, we throw the switch
on Sin City. It's Basher's show.

405
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:41,736
You want broke, blind or bedlam?

406
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:45,322
- How about all three?
- Right, it's done.

407
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:48,534
Third task: Surveillance.

408
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:51,787
Security has an eye
and an ear on everything.

409
00:34:51,996 --> 00:34:54,498
We want an eye and ear on them.
Livingston?

410
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:58,335
Not the least accessible system
I've seen, but close.

411
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:01,922
- There's no closed-circuit I can tap?
- No.

412
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:07,386
Then it's definitely a black bag job.
They employ an in-house technician?

413
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:10,347
Two. And one of them is lonely.

414
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:27,948
Thanks, Charmaine.
I'll return it in an hour.

415
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:32,495
- Say hi to your mom for me.
- Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon.

416
00:35:55,893 --> 00:35:56,894
Watch it, bud!

417
00:35:57,103 --> 00:36:00,022
- You call me bud, pal?
- You call me pal, friend?

418
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:04,193
- You call me friend, jackass?
- Don't call me jackass.

419
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:09,740
433, we have a visual impairment
on the northwest 052 exit-door camera.

420
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:12,785
Copy that. I see them.

421
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:46,193
- Is that a word? You made that up?
- "Obsequious" is a word.

422
00:36:56,912 --> 00:37:00,082
- Please move your balloons.
- You got in my way!

423
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:03,627
- I was trying to deliver my balloons!
- Gentlemen!

424
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:08,966
- He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy!
- You're spitting in my face.

425
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:29,653
And we're up and running.

426
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:35,951
- Why are hallways always that color?
- They say taupe is very soothing.

427
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:41,248
- Hi.
- Fine, thanks.

428
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:55,012
- Move the balloons.
- Move them?

429
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:57,264
I have a client waiting for these.

430
00:37:57,473 --> 00:38:03,020
I don't have time to fool around
with you circus animals.

431
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:38,931
Hey! Hold up a minute!

432
00:38:39,724 --> 00:38:41,350
Excuse me!

433
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,562
Hey! Excuse me!

434
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:50,234
- Hey, you dropped this.
- Oh, thank you.

435
00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:53,779
- How's the reception on those things?
- Excellent.

436
00:38:54,321 --> 00:38:57,408
- Take care.
- Thanks.

437
00:39:03,748 --> 00:39:06,375
- Well ...
- Yeah.

438
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,129
Fourth task: Construction.

439
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:13,883
We need to build an exact
replica of the Bellagio vault.

440
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:17,595
- To practice?
- Something like that.

441
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:19,805
Fifth task: Intelligence.

442
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:24,018
We need those codes, Linus,
from the guy who has all three.

443
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:27,563
- Who, Benedict?
- Learn to love his shadow.

444
00:39:27,772 --> 00:39:32,485
- All I get to do is watch the guy?
- Gotta walk before you crawl.

445
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:36,322
- Reverse that.
- Sixth task: Transport.

446
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:45,664
Well, I am sorry, but $18,500 a piece
is the best offer that I can make.

447
00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:48,626
Well, I understand.

448
00:39:49,001 --> 00:39:53,798
- They are some great-looking vans.
- Yes, sir, top of the line.

449
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,221
- Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr ...?
- Denham. Billy Tim Denham.

450
00:40:01,138 --> 00:40:05,476
- Denham like a jean.
- That's it. Just like the jean.

451
00:40:06,685 --> 00:40:10,648
Man, you got some lovely hands here.
Do you moisturize?

452
00:40:10,856 --> 00:40:13,359
- I'm sorry?
- I've tried lots of lotion.

453
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:17,279
I even went fragrance-free
for a year. Now my sister ...

454
00:40:17,488 --> 00:40:22,243
she uses aloe vera
with a little sunscreen in it.

455
00:40:23,536 --> 00:40:26,914
Ideally, we all should
wear gloves to bed ...

456
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:33,129
but I found there was interference
with my social agenda, you know.

457
00:40:33,546 --> 00:40:39,009
Plus, I react to the camphor. So
I'm not into the traditional remedies.

458
00:40:39,218 --> 00:40:42,722
Let me tell you something.
If you could pay cash ...

459
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:45,182
I could drop that
down to seven ...

460
00:40:45,516 --> 00:40:47,393
Sixteen each.

461
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,645
- No?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:40:49,854 --> 00:40:51,564
- You'd do that?
- Yes, sir.

463
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:54,358
That'd be lovely.
They told me to see you.

464
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:57,987
- Well, I'm glad they did.
- They told me.

465
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:03,659
Well, let me go get the paperwork.
You just wait here at the table.

466
00:41:03,868 --> 00:41:05,453
- You do that.
- Thank you.

467
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:17,590
- Very nice material.
- It's imported silk, Saul.

468
00:41:18,382 --> 00:41:21,010
It's very nice.

469
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:26,348
Gentlemen, would you
excuse us for a second?

470
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:38,360
Saul, you sure you're ready
to do this?

471
00:41:41,614 --> 00:41:45,409
If you ever ask me
that question again, Daniel ...

472
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:48,454
you won't wake up
the following morning.

473
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,002
He's ready.

474
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,927
My name is Lyman.
Zerga.

475
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:06,931
My name is Lyman Zerga.

476
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:12,144
My name is Lyman Zerga.

477
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:37,294
Okay, tell me about Benedict.

478
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:38,963
That guy's a machine.

479
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:40,423
Good afternoon.

480
00:42:40,631 --> 00:42:44,301
He arrives at the Bellagio
every day at 2 p.m.

481
00:42:44,635 --> 00:42:46,095
How are you, Tommy?

482
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:48,347
He remembers every valet's name.

483
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,934
Not bad for a guy
worth 3/4 of a billion.

484
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:55,855
He works hard, hits
the lobby floor at 7 on the nose.

485
00:42:56,063 --> 00:42:58,149
- Good evening, sir.
- How are you?

486
00:42:58,357 --> 00:43:01,569
- Talks with his casino manager.
- About what?

487
00:43:01,777 --> 00:43:02,778
All business.

488
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:06,699
Benedict likes to know
what's going on. Be in control.

489
00:43:06,907 --> 00:43:11,996
There's rarely an incident he doesn't
know about or handle personally.

490
00:43:13,497 --> 00:43:17,168
Spends a few minutes
glad-handing the high rollers.

491
00:43:18,878 --> 00:43:23,841
He speaks Spanish, German and Italian
and is getting good at Japanese.

492
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:29,221
He's out by 7:30
and is handed a black portfolio.

493
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:34,685
Contents: Profits and new security
codes. He heads to the restaurant.

494
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:42,902
Like I said, a machine.

495
00:43:43,194 --> 00:43:46,697
That portfolio contains
codes to all the cage doors?

496
00:43:46,906 --> 00:43:50,534
And two minutes after they're changed,
he's got them.

497
00:43:51,911 --> 00:43:56,874
You guys really can pick them.
This guy's as smart as he is ruthless.

498
00:43:57,124 --> 00:44:01,462
Last guy he caught cheating,
he not only sent up for 10 years ...

499
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,548
he seized his house
and bankrupted his ...

500
00:44:04,757 --> 00:44:06,217
In-law's dealership.

501
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:11,055
He takes out your knees and ruins
your life and anybody you know.

502
00:44:11,263 --> 00:44:12,681
You scared?

503
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:14,683
You suicidal?

504
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,104
Only in the morning.

505
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:20,773
- Now what?
- Now comes the girl.

506
00:44:21,857 --> 00:44:24,985
She comes down after him
if they're in a snit.

507
00:44:25,194 --> 00:44:29,740
- Where does she come from?
- The museum, there. She's the curator.

508
00:44:31,617 --> 00:44:33,077
Here she is.

509
00:44:34,578 --> 00:44:37,415
This is the best part of my day.

510
00:44:50,928 --> 00:44:55,433
I'm not sure we can use her yet.
I haven't even caught her name.

511
00:44:55,641 --> 00:44:57,435
Tess.

512
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:59,562
Huh?

513
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,439
Her name is Tess.

514
00:45:24,462 --> 00:45:26,839
- We have to talk. Now.
- Okay.

515
00:45:31,302 --> 00:45:34,972
Tell me this is not about her
or I walk off the job.

516
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:36,807
Who?

517
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:39,935
Tess. Benedict.
Tell me this isn't about ...

518
00:45:40,144 --> 00:45:43,189
the guy who's screwing your wife.
- Ex-wife.

519
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:45,816
- Tell me.
- It's not about that.

520
00:45:48,486 --> 00:45:53,324
It's not entirely about that.
Remember when we got in this business?

521
00:45:53,532 --> 00:45:56,827
We said we'd play
like we had nothing to lose.

522
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:58,829
Well, I lost something.

523
00:45:59,705 --> 00:46:03,709
I lost someone.
That's why I'm here.

524
00:46:08,672 --> 00:46:11,801
The problem is,
now we're stealing two things.

525
00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:16,305
And if you can't have both,
which do you choose?

526
00:46:16,514 --> 00:46:19,350
Remember, Tess does not split 11 ways.

527
00:46:19,683 --> 00:46:25,356
If everything goes to plan, I won't be
the one that has to make that choice.

528
00:46:30,027 --> 00:46:32,530
- How did she look?
- She looked good.

529
00:46:32,738 --> 00:46:34,031
Thanks.

530
00:47:05,563 --> 00:47:06,939
You like it?

531
00:47:09,024 --> 00:47:11,569
I like that you like it.

532
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:16,741
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

533
00:47:24,123 --> 00:47:27,543
In my hotel, there's always
somebody watching.

534
00:47:29,003 --> 00:47:30,546
I'll see you tonight.

535
00:47:45,144 --> 00:47:47,271
Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?

536
00:47:48,105 --> 00:47:51,942
I don't believe in weakness.
It costs too much.

537
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:54,904
I don't believe in questions either.

538
00:47:55,112 --> 00:47:58,324
Oh, really? Well then,
let me give you a tip.

539
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:02,244
Don't get into Terry Benedict
for too much money.

540
00:48:02,536 --> 00:48:04,330
He doesn't fool around.

541
00:48:04,538 --> 00:48:06,540
- How are you, Eddie?
- Fine, sir.

542
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:08,084
Anything for me?

543
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:12,755
Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position.
Wants to talk to you privately.

544
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:16,092
Who is he?

545
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,220
Businessman of some kind,
from Europe.

546
00:48:19,428 --> 00:48:23,808
Very vague. I asked around.
Word is, he deals primarily in arms.

547
00:48:24,183 --> 00:48:26,060
- One of the biggest.
- Zerga.

548
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,937
Yes, sir.

549
00:48:28,396 --> 00:48:31,941
- Never heard of him.
- That's why I don't doubt it.

550
00:48:32,149 --> 00:48:35,986
- He's staying here?
- He's in the Mirador suite.

551
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,990
- How's he doing?
- Up, almost 200.

552
00:48:41,492 --> 00:48:43,452
Good for him.

553
00:48:58,175 --> 00:49:02,888
You're 30 seconds late.
I was about to send out a search ...

554
00:49:04,223 --> 00:49:05,891
Hello, Tess.

555
00:49:07,351 --> 00:49:09,061
What are you doing here?

556
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:11,522
I'm out.

557
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:13,441
- Out?
- Of prison.

558
00:49:13,649 --> 00:49:16,986
Remember? I went for cigarettes
and didn't come back.

559
00:49:17,236 --> 00:49:20,030
I don't smoke.
Don't sit.

560
00:49:20,573 --> 00:49:25,911
- They say I paid my debt to society.
- Funny, I never got a check.

561
00:49:26,412 --> 00:49:28,539
You're not wearing your ring.

562
00:49:29,373 --> 00:49:33,002
I don't have a husband,
or didn't you get the papers?

563
00:49:33,627 --> 00:49:37,298
- My last day inside.
- I told you I'd write.

564
00:49:40,426 --> 00:49:45,431
- Danny, go now before ...
- What? Benedict?

565
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:49,602
How you doing?
Whiskey and whiskey.

566
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:55,566
You're doing a great job at the museum.
The Vermeer is quite good.

567
00:49:55,816 --> 00:49:59,862
- Vibrant. But his work fell off later.
- Remind you of anyone?

568
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:05,076
I always confuse Monet and Manet.
Which one married his mistress?

569
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:07,620
- Monet.
- And Manet had syphilis.

570
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:10,623
They also painted occasionally.

571
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:16,879
All right, I'll make this quick.

572
00:50:17,088 --> 00:50:18,964
I came here for you.

573
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:24,220
I want to get on with my life.
I want you with me.

574
00:50:24,845 --> 00:50:26,680
You're a thief and a liar.

575
00:50:27,306 --> 00:50:30,518
I lied about being a thief.
I don't do that now.

576
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:32,603
- Steal?
- Lie.

577
00:50:33,312 --> 00:50:35,815
Terry doesn't have to make
the distinction.

578
00:50:36,023 --> 00:50:39,151
He's clear on both.

579
00:50:39,652 --> 00:50:41,779
- You have a problem.
- Only one?

580
00:50:41,987 --> 00:50:47,284
You've met too many people like you.
I'm with Terry now.

581
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:52,665
Does he make you laugh?

582
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:57,211
He doesn't make me cry.

583
00:51:09,473 --> 00:51:14,478
- The fight is Saturday night?
- Yes, would you like tickets?

584
00:51:14,687 --> 00:51:18,482
No. Hand-to-hand combat
does not interest me.

585
00:51:18,691 --> 00:51:22,153
I have a package arriving
here that evening.

586
00:51:22,737 --> 00:51:25,281
A black briefcase, standard size ...

587
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:30,035
the contents of which
is very valuable to me.

588
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:33,164
I'll put it in the house safe.

589
00:51:33,372 --> 00:51:37,418
The house safe is for brandy
and grandmother's pearls.

590
00:51:38,502 --> 00:51:43,132
- I need something more secure.
- Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our ...

591
00:51:43,382 --> 00:51:48,179
I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
that your generosity in this matter ...

592
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:51,265
will not go overlooked.

593
00:51:51,474 --> 00:51:57,354
Now, what can you offer me
besides the safe?

594
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:02,693
People you steal from have insurance.
They get made whole again.

595
00:52:03,027 --> 00:52:07,782
I had to leave New York to escape.
How do I get my five years back?

596
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:12,203
- What you can do is not throw ...
- You don't know anything.

597
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:15,164
You don't love me,
you want someone else.

598
00:52:15,372 --> 00:52:21,378
- I must live with that. But not him.
- Spoken like a true ex-husband.

599
00:52:21,587 --> 00:52:24,381
- I'm not joking.
- I'm not laughing.

600
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:28,552
There's a conflict of interest
when you give me love advice.

601
00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:32,890
Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

602
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:38,312
Do you remember what I said
when we first met?

603
00:52:39,063 --> 00:52:43,734
- That I better know what I'm doing.
- Do you? Now?

604
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:46,237
You should go if you don't.

605
00:52:46,654 --> 00:52:49,740
- I know what I'm doing.
- What are you doing?

606
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,119
Just catching up.

607
00:52:53,452 --> 00:52:55,788
- Meet my ex-husband.
- Danny Ocean.

608
00:52:55,996 --> 00:52:58,624
- Mr. Ocean.
- I'm in your seat.

609
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,711
Forgive my lateness.
A guest required my attention.

610
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,216
That's fine. Danny was walking
through and spotted me.

611
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:09,510
- Is that so?
- Imagine the odds.

612
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,555
Of all the gin joints
in all the world.

613
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:15,391
You recently were
released from prison?

614
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,600
That's right.

615
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:19,937
- How does it feel to be out?
- About the same.

616
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:25,776
- Danny was just about to ...
- I just stopped by to say hi to Tess.

617
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:27,236
Stay, have a drink.

618
00:53:27,486 --> 00:53:29,113
- I can't.
- He can't.

619
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,119
Well, then ...

620
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:39,415
I imagine we won't see
Mr. Ocean anytime soon.

621
00:53:39,623 --> 00:53:41,125
You never know.

622
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,295
I know everything
happening in my hotels.

623
00:53:44,628 --> 00:53:47,298
So I should put
those towels back.

624
00:53:47,506 --> 00:53:49,967
No, the towels you can keep.

625
00:53:55,222 --> 00:53:57,975
- Good to see you, Tess.
- Take care, Danny.

626
00:53:58,184 --> 00:54:00,311
- Terry.
- Danny.

627
00:55:26,147 --> 00:55:27,314
Stinking ...

628
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:28,983
Tomorrow the day is yours.

629
00:55:30,776 --> 00:55:33,696
Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume.

630
00:55:33,904 --> 00:55:37,742
Saul's package arrives at 7:05.
Linus grabs our codes.

631
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:43,122
All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30,
Yen is locked in and we're committed.

632
00:55:43,456 --> 00:55:48,586
From this point, we have 30 minutes
to blow the power or he suffocates.

633
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:06,145
Once the electricity goes,
access to the vault ...

634
00:56:06,353 --> 00:56:11,108
and its elevator shut down
for two minutes. That's when we go.

635
00:56:15,112 --> 00:56:19,200
You're in the middle of the room,
10 feet from everything.

636
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:23,287
You have to get to the door
without touching the floor.

637
00:56:23,788 --> 00:56:25,122
What do you do?

638
00:56:25,623 --> 00:56:28,626
- Ten says he shorts it.
- Twenty.

639
00:56:36,342 --> 00:56:38,344
Window or aisle, boys?

640
00:56:39,678 --> 00:56:41,806
Yeah, we're in deep shit.

641
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:45,810
That poxy demo crew
didn't back the main line.

642
00:56:46,143 --> 00:56:49,188
They naused up the mainframe.
Naused it up!

643
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,566
- You understand him?
- I'll explain later.

644
00:56:52,983 --> 00:56:57,113
They're so pony they blew
the backup grids one by one.

645
00:56:57,321 --> 00:56:58,906
Basher, what happened?

646
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:02,785
They did what I would have done
but by accident.

647
00:57:02,993 --> 00:57:06,622
Now they know their weakness,
they're fixing it.

648
00:57:07,248 --> 00:57:11,752
So unless we intend to do this job
in Reno, we're in Barney.

649
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:16,924
Barney Rubble.
Trouble!

650
00:57:20,052 --> 00:57:22,596
- We could always ...
- By tomorrow?

651
00:57:23,556 --> 00:57:27,184
Hang on a minute, hang on.
We could use a pinch.

652
00:57:29,562 --> 00:57:31,772
What's a pinch?

653
00:57:32,356 --> 00:57:36,861
A device which creates a cardiac
arrest for broadband circuitry.

654
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:40,614
Better yet, a pinch is
a bomb without the bomb.

655
00:57:40,865 --> 00:57:44,952
When a nuclear weapon detonates,
its electromagnetic pulse ...

656
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:48,372
shuts down any power source
within its blast radius.

657
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:53,586
It usually doesn't matter because
a nuclear weapon destroys everything.

658
00:57:53,878 --> 00:57:57,339
A pinch creates a similar
electromagnetic pulse ...

659
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:01,927
without mass destruction and death.
Instead of Hiroshima you get ...

660
00:58:02,136 --> 00:58:04,555
the 17th century.
- How long?

661
00:58:04,764 --> 00:58:05,848
30 seconds.

662
00:58:06,307 --> 00:58:11,020
Could a pinch knock out
the power of an entire city?

663
00:58:11,228 --> 00:58:14,273
- Like, for instance ...
- Las Vegas?

664
00:58:16,484 --> 00:58:18,110
Yeah, I think it might.

665
00:58:18,652 --> 00:58:21,864
There's only one pinch
big enough to do it.

666
00:58:22,073 --> 00:58:23,240
Where?

667
00:58:36,462 --> 00:58:38,756
Let's go.
Yen, Basher, come on.

668
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:40,591
Where you going?

669
00:58:40,925 --> 00:58:42,551
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

670
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,097
Oh, no, no, no!
Don't leave me with these guys!

671
00:58:55,523 --> 00:58:56,524
Start.

672
00:58:56,732 --> 00:58:58,943
- I got one.
- You thinking of one?

673
00:58:59,276 --> 00:59:02,571
- No, I've thought of one.
- You're thinking of one.

674
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,865
No, I'm done. I have it.

675
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,575
- You a man?
- Yes. 19.

676
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:08,202
- You alive?
- Yes. 18.

677
00:59:08,452 --> 00:59:10,871
- Evel Knievel.
- Shit!

678
00:59:11,122 --> 00:59:12,790
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not.

679
00:59:12,998 --> 00:59:15,584
- Your hand's in my face.
- It's not.

680
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:18,712
- Am I touching you?
- Your hand's in my face.

681
00:59:18,963 --> 00:59:20,715
- Move.
- I didn't touch you.

682
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:24,009
- You just touched me.
- You made me touch you.

683
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,887
This is your side.
This is your side.

684
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,224
Get off. Get off.

685
00:59:58,252 --> 01:00:01,047
I'm gonna need a score
of car batteries ...

686
01:00:01,255 --> 01:00:04,550
Where's Linus?
Where's Linus?!

687
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,604
- There he is.
- Oh, would you look at this doughnut?

688
01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:30,159
Should someone help him?

689
01:00:30,367 --> 01:00:34,497
That's a great idea, Albert.
Let's all get nicked.

690
01:00:39,794 --> 01:00:41,045
Back it up.

691
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,647
Let him in.

692
01:01:07,154 --> 01:01:09,532
You stupid bastard!

693
01:01:15,121 --> 01:01:17,248
- I say stay, you stay.
- Got it.

694
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:20,668
Lose focus for one second,
somebody gets hurt!

695
01:01:20,918 --> 01:01:22,294
I got it.

696
01:01:26,674 --> 01:01:28,426
Where are they?

697
01:01:29,093 --> 01:01:32,596
That's what I want to know.
Where the hell are they?

698
01:01:32,805 --> 01:01:36,642
- They will be here.
- "They will be here." Schmuck!

699
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:46,277
You boys have a nice trip?

700
01:01:57,288 --> 01:01:58,831
We have a problem.

701
01:01:59,874 --> 01:02:01,792
You've been red-flagged.

702
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:05,838
The moment you enter the casino,
they'll be watching.

703
01:02:06,047 --> 01:02:10,134
Like hawks.
Hawks with video cameras.

704
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:13,763
That's a problem.

705
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:16,724
- Saul, turn that off.
- When I'm ready ...

706
01:02:16,932 --> 01:02:20,352
- Saul!
- It's off! It's off!

707
01:02:22,813 --> 01:02:25,024
Any idea how this happened?

708
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:27,943
- No.
- Oh, come on.

709
01:02:28,152 --> 01:02:33,032
He's been chasing Benedict's girl.
They had an argument two nights ago.

710
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,285
- I tailed you.
- Who told you to?

711
01:02:36,494 --> 01:02:39,622
I did. I worried you couldn't
leave Tess alone.

712
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:41,082
- Tess?
- My wife.

713
01:02:41,332 --> 01:02:43,793
- Ex-wife.
- Tess is here?

714
01:02:45,169 --> 01:02:49,548
I'm sorry. I didn't know if it
would sting you, but it did.

715
01:02:49,757 --> 01:02:51,801
- You're out, Danny.
- He's out?

716
01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:55,596
Or we call it off.
His involvement puts us at risk.

717
01:02:55,846 --> 01:02:59,975
- It's not your call.
- You put her before us and made it mine.

718
01:03:00,184 --> 01:03:02,061
This is my job.

719
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,479
Not anymore.

720
01:03:03,687 --> 01:03:07,191
He can't just be out.
Who's gonna trigger the vault?

721
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,193
Kid, you up for it?

722
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:16,325
I can do it.

723
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:20,329
Done. Locate the others.
Tell them the change in plan.

724
01:03:20,538 --> 01:03:22,206
Curtain goes up at 7.

725
01:03:22,415 --> 01:03:27,420
Tess is with Benedict now?
She's too tall for him.

726
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,215
Yes. No.

727
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,427
Very much no.

728
01:03:36,637 --> 01:03:42,393
Then inform Mr. Levin he'll be better
off watching the fight at home on TV.

729
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:46,480
Surely, he must have HBO.
That's it.

730
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,236
Hi.

731
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:57,867
What were you thinking about?

732
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,202
You.

733
01:04:02,913 --> 01:04:05,040
Where you gonna put your hands?

734
01:04:07,752 --> 01:04:09,128
No good.

735
01:04:10,921 --> 01:04:13,382
Don't touch your tie. Look at me.

736
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:17,094
You need to answer my question.
Where do you look?

737
01:04:17,303 --> 01:04:22,308
No. Look down, they know you're lying.
Up, and you don't know the truth.

738
01:04:22,516 --> 01:04:25,269
Don't use seven words if four will do.

739
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:30,900
Be specific, but not memorable.
Be funny, but don't make him laugh.

740
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:34,904
He's got to like you,
then forget you once you leave.

741
01:04:35,112 --> 01:04:38,240
And, for God's sake,
whatever you do, don't ...

742
01:04:38,449 --> 01:04:40,701
Russ! Can you take a look at this?

743
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,328
Sure.

744
01:04:58,886 --> 01:05:00,346
Saul?

745
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:07,019
It's time.

746
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:26,872
Okay.

747
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:28,791
Let's do it.

748
01:05:32,044 --> 01:05:34,880
On a perfectly clear night
in Las Vegas ...

749
01:05:35,089 --> 01:05:39,135
with the expected crowd
of celebrities and sports fans ...

750
01:05:39,343 --> 01:05:44,306
piling into the MGM Grand, the two
best heavyweights in the world ...

751
01:05:44,515 --> 01:05:50,479
prepare to meet after an eight-month
dance toward each other.

752
01:05:53,023 --> 01:05:54,358
Mr. Zerga?

753
01:05:54,859 --> 01:05:56,527
Mr. Benedict.

754
01:05:56,777 --> 01:06:02,032
- I'm very busy. Are we on schedule?
- I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

755
01:06:02,575 --> 01:06:06,370
My courier should be here momentarily.

756
01:06:27,058 --> 01:06:30,686
Eighteen.
Blackjack!

757
01:06:44,742 --> 01:06:48,496
Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean
is in the west slots.

758
01:06:50,247 --> 01:06:54,668
I can't have private security
personnel in the casino cages.

759
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,212
Of course not.

760
01:06:57,713 --> 01:07:00,716
Saul!
Saul Bloom, is that you?

761
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:04,220
Saul! Saul, it's me!
Bucky Buchanan!

762
01:07:04,428 --> 01:07:06,764
Remember?
From Saratoga!

763
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,353
Mikael. Vladimir.

764
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:16,148
Hey! Hey, Saul!

765
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,735
Mr. Benedict, please.

766
01:07:19,944 --> 01:07:24,281
I have never enjoyed the touch
of steel to my skin.

767
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,332
Lift them up, please.

768
01:07:41,716 --> 01:07:46,554
I acknowledge your briefcase contains
nothing dangerous or illicit.

769
01:07:46,804 --> 01:07:50,641
I agree to take said briefcase
and store it in my vault ...

770
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:52,810
for a period of 24 hours.

771
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:56,689
- I cannot allow you into the vault.
- Why not?

772
01:07:56,897 --> 01:08:02,445
Insurance, for one. Security.
Most of all, I just don't trust you.

773
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,948
Excuse me.

774
01:08:09,368 --> 01:08:13,789
I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
He's in the keno bar now.

775
01:08:13,998 --> 01:08:17,835
Mr. Zerga, this is my
casino manager, Mr. Walsh.

776
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:22,423
He will have your briefcase stored
in our vault while you watch.

777
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:25,051
Those are my terms.
Yes or no?

778
01:08:25,843 --> 01:08:29,221
You leave me no choice.

779
01:08:32,767 --> 01:08:35,519
Dude, don't do that
in front of the pinch.

780
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:23,401
Deep breaths.
You'll do fine.

781
01:09:23,651 --> 01:09:26,195
- Thank you.
- No sweat. You're a natural.

782
01:09:26,404 --> 01:09:28,614
But don 't screw up.

783
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:38,707
- Who gets the penne?
- Right here.

784
01:09:44,672 --> 01:09:45,923
You ready?

785
01:09:48,175 --> 01:09:52,722
This is our security center,
where we oversee the casino and vault.

786
01:09:52,972 --> 01:09:55,683
You'll monitor your briefcase
from here.

787
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,435
Don't let me keep you.

788
01:09:57,643 --> 01:10:00,479
- Mr. Zerga.
- Mr. Benedict.

789
01:10:06,527 --> 01:10:08,154
Linus, you're up.

790
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:10,698
Got him.

791
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:12,533
Mr. Benedict.

792
01:10:13,325 --> 01:10:16,245
Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

793
01:10:16,454 --> 01:10:18,998
I need two minutes of your time.

794
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,251
- Anything for the NGC.
- Thanks.

795
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,296
Will you accompany me
to pit five, please?

796
01:10:44,231 --> 01:10:47,109
- You make the deposit when?
- At your signal.

797
01:10:47,318 --> 01:10:51,322
What do we look like,
a couple of peckerwood jackasses?

798
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,950
How does that feel?
You all right?

799
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:57,953
Want something to read?
A magazine?

800
01:10:58,162 --> 01:11:00,164
All right.
Counting down.

801
01:11:00,498 --> 01:11:03,876
Thirty minutes of
breathing time starts now.

802
01:11:04,502 --> 01:11:07,129
This just came to our attention today.

803
01:11:07,338 --> 01:11:10,508
Apparently, he's got
a record longer than my ...

804
01:11:11,425 --> 01:11:13,010
It's long.

805
01:11:16,847 --> 01:11:19,183
If he is who you say he is.

806
01:11:24,355 --> 01:11:26,607
You been at the commission long?

807
01:11:27,233 --> 01:11:31,278
- About 18 months.
- You know Hal Lindley? Worked with him?

808
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,699
Not since he died last year.

809
01:11:39,703 --> 01:11:44,166
Ramón Escalante? Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

810
01:11:44,417 --> 01:11:46,001
What's going on here?

811
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:50,840
- It's come to our attention ...
- We should speak off the floor.

812
01:11:51,424 --> 01:11:53,467
Charlie.

813
01:12:14,989 --> 01:12:16,741
Thank you.

814
01:12:18,409 --> 01:12:21,746
- No. I want you out of here.
- Give me one moment.

815
01:12:21,996 --> 01:12:25,541
- I've had it. I want you gone.
- Tess, come here.

816
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,460
You're up to something.

817
01:12:27,668 --> 01:12:31,797
Don't say you're here for me.
You're pulling a job, aren't you?

818
01:12:32,006 --> 01:12:35,384
Well, no matter what it is,
you won't win me back.

819
01:12:35,634 --> 01:12:38,262
Tess, I just came to say goodbye.

820
01:12:45,436 --> 01:12:47,271
Goodbye.

821
01:13:01,118 --> 01:13:03,162
You be good.

822
01:13:13,464 --> 01:13:16,509
- Mr. Ocean.
- Mr. Benedict wishes to see you.

823
01:13:16,967 --> 01:13:18,719
I thought he might.

824
01:13:20,471 --> 01:13:22,681
Good afternoon, Mr. Escalante.

825
01:13:22,848 --> 01:13:25,142
Or should I call you Mr. Catton?

826
01:13:26,477 --> 01:13:30,231
You're Frank Catton,
of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn ...

827
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:34,693
and the New York state
penitentiary system. Are you not?

828
01:13:36,862 --> 01:13:40,616
I take it from your silence
you won't refute that.

829
01:13:41,075 --> 01:13:45,079
Mr. Benedict, you're employing
an ex-convict. As you know ...

830
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,456
Goddamn cracker.

831
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:52,128
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

832
01:13:52,336 --> 01:13:55,172
Black man can't earn a decent wage?

833
01:13:55,423 --> 01:13:58,884
- You wanna throw me on the street.
- I'm doing my job.

834
01:13:59,093 --> 01:14:04,640
Want me to get on the table and dance?
Shine your shoes? Smile at you?

835
01:14:05,099 --> 01:14:10,396
You sure won't let me deal the cards.
You might as well call it "Whitejack"!

836
01:14:12,773 --> 01:14:17,862
I don't know what to say to that.
Race has nothing to do with it.

837
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:21,532
- Yeah, right.
- What a horrible thing to say!

838
01:14:23,075 --> 01:14:28,956
You, of all people, know the NGC has
always supported hiring colored ...

839
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:33,210
- No! I didn't mean it!
- Okay. Come on, sit down.

840
01:14:34,128 --> 01:14:36,380
- Sit down.
- You better talk to him.

841
01:14:37,048 --> 01:14:39,383
- He's got it.
- Sit down.

842
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:42,386
Virgil. Turk.
Deliver the package.

843
01:14:54,607 --> 01:14:56,567
- Where's your card?
- I lost it.

844
01:14:56,776 --> 01:14:58,569
- You serious?
- I'm so stupid.

845
01:14:58,778 --> 01:15:01,489
- You are so stupid! You know that?
- Hey!

846
01:15:01,739 --> 01:15:05,534
You think it helps to call someone
names who's upset?

847
01:15:05,785 --> 01:15:09,455
- Hey! Keep it down.
- Sorry. Sorry.

848
01:15:09,663 --> 01:15:13,334
- Where did this come from?
- High roller's room.

849
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:17,129
- It's Mr. Benedict's stuff.
- Joe, take this inside.

850
01:15:17,338 --> 01:15:21,050
- Count room?
- No, to the vault.

851
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,719
Benedict's money goes in the vault.

852
01:15:23,928 --> 01:15:28,474
Next time, remember the card,
and we won't run into this again.

853
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,810
- Stupid.
- Jeez!

854
01:15:37,608 --> 01:15:39,610
Yo! Hold that, please.

855
01:15:41,362 --> 01:15:46,409
- There's your briefcase now, Mr. Zerga.
- Wonderful.

856
01:15:52,289 --> 01:15:53,999
That's my cue.

857
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,961
Give Basher the go.

858
01:15:57,962 --> 01:15:59,588
Bash, what's your status?

859
01:15:59,797 --> 01:16:03,342
- Bash!
- Easy. No need to shout, guv'nor.

860
01:16:03,551 --> 01:16:06,887
- What's your status?
- I'm nearly there.

861
01:16:24,655 --> 01:16:26,323
Come on, come on.

862
01:16:27,366 --> 01:16:31,412
Mr. Walsh, show this man
off the premises.

863
01:16:31,746 --> 01:16:34,623
Don't ever set foot
in my casino again.

864
01:16:34,832 --> 01:16:36,083
Sir?

865
01:16:37,334 --> 01:16:39,420
- Cracker!
- Oh, dear God!

866
01:16:47,678 --> 01:16:52,266
Oh! I forgot my pager.
I left it. Sorry.

867
01:16:53,851 --> 01:16:55,394
- Know the way back?
- I do.

868
01:16:55,603 --> 01:16:56,729
Good.

869
01:16:57,354 --> 01:16:59,231
Okay. Enjoy the fight.

870
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:01,984
Sorry!

871
01:17:07,531 --> 01:17:11,160
How much longer you figure
Mr. Benedict's gonna be?

872
01:17:20,878 --> 01:17:23,714
No cameras in this room, huh?

873
01:17:25,216 --> 01:17:26,675
Yeah.

874
01:17:28,135 --> 01:17:31,389
Don't want anybody seeing
what goes on in here.

875
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,268
He's not coming, is he?

876
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:50,741
We're gonna step outside.
Leave you to talk things over.

877
01:17:53,452 --> 01:17:57,748
I hadn't seen my wife in three weeks,
so I decided to call her.

878
01:17:57,957 --> 01:18:01,877
"I love you, you love me."
"I miss you, you miss me."

879
01:18:02,086 --> 01:18:05,381
That went well, but then
I went to this party ...

880
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:12,888
I show up at 1 p.m.
She expected me at 11 a.m. ...

881
01:18:13,097 --> 01:18:16,934
so she was going crazy.
I said, "What do you expect?

882
01:18:17,143 --> 01:18:20,896
What do you think goes on?
It's not choir practice."

883
01:18:21,188 --> 01:18:22,857
Oh, shit.

884
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:28,320
Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

885
01:18:28,529 --> 01:18:32,158
I am very satisfied.

886
01:18:34,785 --> 01:18:39,790
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

887
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:43,169
All right.

888
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,300
Jesus!

889
01:18:50,718 --> 01:18:52,178
Bruiser!

890
01:18:52,386 --> 01:18:56,807
- Not until later!
- Sorry, Danny. I forgot.

891
01:18:57,016 --> 01:18:58,601
It's all right.

892
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:03,189
- How's your wife?
- Pregnant again.

893
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:07,735
Well, it happens.
Let's get started. Come here.

894
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:40,226
- You're almost there, Linus.
- Who's that guy?

895
01:19:40,684 --> 01:19:43,687
- I got a bogey in west corridor.
- Mr. Zerga!

896
01:19:47,733 --> 01:19:51,529
- Call a doctor! Mr. Zerga!
- Put this under his head.

897
01:19:51,737 --> 01:19:54,657
Going to video now.

898
01:19:54,907 --> 01:19:57,201
- To the Eye in the Sky ASAP.

899
01:19:57,410 --> 01:20:00,037
We have a man down
who's unconscious.

900
01:20:11,257 --> 01:20:12,883
Oh, Jesus!

901
01:20:14,051 --> 01:20:18,514
- Did you really think I'd sit this out?
- You didn't trust me?

902
01:20:18,723 --> 01:20:20,224
I do now.

903
01:20:20,933 --> 01:20:22,393
Come on.

904
01:20:52,089 --> 01:20:54,300
Someone call for a doctor?

905
01:21:03,309 --> 01:21:07,229
- How'd you get here?
- Had to give a friend two million.

906
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:12,234
But what about Rusty? The argument?
I mean, what was that about?

907
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:18,324
Come on. Why not just tell me?
Why put me through all this?

908
01:21:18,532 --> 01:21:21,786
Where's the fun in that?
Let's get going.

909
01:21:22,495 --> 01:21:25,331
Come on, man! Breathe!

910
01:21:25,706 --> 01:21:28,125
Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

911
01:21:33,964 --> 01:21:37,968
I'm sorry. We've lost him.

912
01:21:39,512 --> 01:21:43,182
- Dude, I told you to hurry.
- Don't do that. Just don't.

913
01:21:43,391 --> 01:21:45,309
I didn't tell you to hurry?

914
01:21:46,185 --> 01:21:49,021
Come on, get up! Get up!

915
01:21:54,402 --> 01:21:56,237
Had enough yet?

916
01:22:21,929 --> 01:22:26,016
- These things will hold us, right?
- They should.

917
01:22:41,907 --> 01:22:43,826
Livingston, we're set.

918
01:22:44,535 --> 01:22:47,455
- Livingston, we're set.
- Basher, we're set.

919
01:22:48,372 --> 01:22:50,541
Hang on a minute, chief.

920
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,502
We don 't have one.
Yen 's gonna suffocate.

921
01:22:53,711 --> 01:22:58,382
Well, then you better leave off
bothering me, don't you think?

922
01:23:54,688 --> 01:23:56,690
All right, crack them.

923
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,202
Go.

924
01:24:14,792 --> 01:24:16,335
Shit!

925
01:24:17,253 --> 01:24:18,587
Cut it.

926
01:24:43,487 --> 01:24:44,822
Hey!

927
01:24:46,824 --> 01:24:49,785
Pit six, table five.
Dealers compromised.

928
01:24:49,994 --> 01:24:53,497
Trade's breached at tables three,
five, six and ten.

929
01:25:05,092 --> 01:25:07,845
Get your coat.
Get your coat.

930
01:25:08,512 --> 01:25:10,765
Look, this is crazy!
What ...?

931
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:54,809
Not yet.
Not yet.

932
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:01,732
Go ahead.

933
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:07,905
- You think Yen made it out okay?
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

934
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,699
How we doing?

935
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:14,495
Okay, I guess.

936
01:26:31,262 --> 01:26:36,058
There's a 95-pound Chinese man
with $160 million behind this door.

937
01:26:36,267 --> 01:26:38,519
- Let's get him out.
- Yeah.

938
01:26:49,113 --> 01:26:51,449
- 10 cents he shorts it.
- No bet.

939
01:26:51,657 --> 01:26:53,367
Try him again.

940
01:27:25,024 --> 01:27:26,484
Okay.

941
01:27:33,657 --> 01:27:35,993
Hey.
Where we at, boys?

942
01:27:36,202 --> 01:27:40,247
- Pins and floor sensors, now.
- Blinding.

943
01:27:46,921 --> 01:27:48,589
Here we go.

944
01:27:57,014 --> 01:28:00,184
Counting down from 20.
Now.

945
01:28:00,434 --> 01:28:01,811
Twenty.

946
01:28:04,647 --> 01:28:08,776
- Don't blow the door. Can you read me?
- Ten ...

947
01:28:09,026 --> 01:28:10,945
nine, eight ...

948
01:28:11,153 --> 01:28:15,408
- Maybe the pinch blew out his earwigs.
- Do not blow the door!

949
01:28:17,535 --> 01:28:20,287
two, one.

950
01:28:28,462 --> 01:28:29,714
What's wrong?

951
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:31,424
Something ...

952
01:28:44,103 --> 01:28:46,564
Did you check the batteries?

953
01:28:48,649 --> 01:28:52,069
You know, lose focus
in this game for one second ...

954
01:28:52,278 --> 01:28:56,532
I know, somebody gets hurt.
You don't hear Yen complaining.

955
01:29:17,136 --> 01:29:18,637
Yen?

956
01:29:26,645 --> 01:29:28,773
Where the fuck you been?

957
01:29:31,442 --> 01:29:33,194
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

958
01:29:43,204 --> 01:29:47,625
That is the sexiest thing
I have ever seen.

959
01:29:51,003 --> 01:29:52,296
Rusty, you're up.

960
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:07,478
- You gonna answer that?
- I don't have a cell phone.

961
01:30:11,524 --> 01:30:13,234
This isn't mine.

962
01:30:14,985 --> 01:30:16,612
See who it is.

963
01:30:18,614 --> 01:30:21,617
- Hello?
- May I have a word with Mr. Benedict?

964
01:30:21,826 --> 01:30:23,369
It's for you.

965
01:30:27,957 --> 01:30:31,585
- Who the hell is this?
- The man who 's robbing you.

966
01:30:36,507 --> 01:30:41,846
- What's going on in the vault?
- Nothing, sir. It's all normal.

967
01:30:42,054 --> 01:30:43,556
Show me.

968
01:30:45,558 --> 01:30:48,644
- You're mistaken.
- Watching your monitors?

969
01:30:48,853 --> 01:30:51,188
Okay, keep watching.

970
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:04,035
In this town,
luck can change that quickly.

971
01:31:04,243 --> 01:31:07,663
- Find out how much money's down there.
- Yes, sir.

972
01:31:24,597 --> 01:31:25,973
Tess?

973
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,267
Tess?

974
01:31:29,143 --> 01:31:30,895
Perhaps you should ...

975
01:31:31,228 --> 01:31:33,147
Perhaps I should what?

976
01:31:34,023 --> 01:31:37,902
It would be better if you weren't
around here for this.

977
01:31:45,868 --> 01:31:48,579
All right, you proved your point.

978
01:31:48,788 --> 01:31:53,918
You broke into my vault.
Congratulations. You're a dead man.

979
01:31:54,126 --> 01:31:58,923
- Maybe.
- Maybe? May I ask how you will leave?

980
01:31:59,256 --> 01:32:03,052
You think I'll let you
take my money out my casino doors?

981
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:07,431
- No. You'll carry it out for us.
- Why would I do that?

982
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,266
Look at your monitor.

983
01:32:11,018 --> 01:32:15,606
As your manager's probably reporting,
you have over $160 million ...

984
01:32:15,856 --> 01:32:19,944
in your vault tonight.
We're only packing up half that.

985
01:32:20,194 --> 01:32:24,407
The other half we're leaving,
booby-trapped, as a hostage.

986
01:32:24,698 --> 01:32:28,911
You let our $80 million go,
and you get to keep yours.

987
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:32,748
You try and stop us,
we'll blow both cashloads.

988
01:32:36,502 --> 01:32:42,508
You can lose $80 million secretly
or lose $160 million publicly.

989
01:32:42,717 --> 01:32:44,051
Your decision.
Hi.

990
01:32:55,354 --> 01:32:56,981
Make the call.

991
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:04,155
911 emergency response.

992
01:33:05,448 --> 01:33:08,492
- Where's Danny?
- He's fine. He's in good form.

993
01:33:08,701 --> 01:33:12,580
- He asks that you go up and watch TV.
- He does?

994
01:33:12,997 --> 01:33:17,793
We have three men with explosives
who have taken control of our vault.

995
01:33:20,588 --> 01:33:22,631
- Okay.
- It's okay.

996
01:33:23,049 --> 01:33:24,717
- You have a deal.
- I promise.

997
01:33:24,925 --> 01:33:27,553
Fantastic.
Here's what you do:

998
01:33:29,055 --> 01:33:32,850
The guys in the vault will put
six bags in the elevator.

999
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,977
It will rise to your cages.

1000
01:33:35,227 --> 01:33:39,356
Three of your guards will carry
the bags into the casino.

1001
01:33:39,774 --> 01:33:45,279
If they take more than 20 seconds
to reach the floor, or there's a switch ...

1002
01:33:45,529 --> 01:33:48,074
we'll blow all the money.

1003
01:33:49,867 --> 01:33:53,245
- He's in the casino by the slots.
- Of course I am.

1004
01:33:53,454 --> 01:33:58,876
I'm staying in your hotel.
I have two words for you: Mini bar.

1005
01:34:00,628 --> 01:34:03,214
Once the guards
hit the casino floor ...

1006
01:34:03,422 --> 01:34:08,844
a white van will pull up outside.
Your guards will load the rear.

1007
01:34:09,053 --> 01:34:14,350
If anyone so much as approaches
the driver's door, we'll blow everything.

1008
01:34:15,768 --> 01:34:20,523
When I hear the van is away and
the money is secure, my men will leave.

1009
01:34:20,731 --> 01:34:24,318
Once their safety is confirmed,
you get your vault.

1010
01:34:24,902 --> 01:34:26,821
The S.W.A.T. Team is here.

1011
01:34:28,447 --> 01:34:30,032
All right.

1012
01:34:30,241 --> 01:34:35,413
Now, I have complied with your
every request. Would you agree?

1013
01:34:35,663 --> 01:34:36,956
I would.

1014
01:34:37,415 --> 01:34:40,292
Good. Because now
I have one of my own:

1015
01:34:41,127 --> 01:34:44,922
Run and hide, asshole.
Run and hide.

1016
01:34:45,131 --> 01:34:50,177
If you're picked up buying a $100,000
sports car in Newport Beach ...

1017
01:34:50,386 --> 01:34:55,683
I'll be disappointed. I want my
people to find you, and when they do ...

1018
01:34:55,891 --> 01:34:59,687
rest assured, we won't
hand you over to the police.

1019
01:34:59,895 --> 01:35:04,650
So, my advice to you again
is this: Run and hide.

1020
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:07,737
That is all that I ask.

1021
01:35:30,134 --> 01:35:34,722
Mr. Benedict, our guys say that
van is headed for McCarran Airport.

1022
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:38,517
I want my vault back
before that van hits the tarmac.

1023
01:35:48,861 --> 01:35:51,489
Night goggles on.
Prepare to cut power.

1024
01:35:55,034 --> 01:35:56,285
Ready.

1025
01:35:59,121 --> 01:36:00,956
Cutting power now.

1026
01:36:03,334 --> 01:36:04,502
Do it.

1027
01:36:06,295 --> 01:36:08,631
Breaching elevator doors now.

1028
01:36:09,215 --> 01:36:12,676
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1029
01:36:13,219 --> 01:36:14,428
Wait a minute.

1030
01:36:14,678 --> 01:36:16,514
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1031
01:36:16,764 --> 01:36:19,266
- Take him down, now!
- I got him!

1032
01:36:21,018 --> 01:36:24,105
- Lights! We need power now!
- Give it to him.

1033
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,618
What's going on?
Talk to me.

1034
01:36:37,827 --> 01:36:41,997
It appears an explosive incendiary
device has been detonated.

1035
01:36:42,206 --> 01:36:45,918
Continuing search for survivors.

1036
01:36:46,127 --> 01:36:48,963
Tell them to take the van.
I'll be there.

1037
01:36:49,213 --> 01:36:52,299
And find out how they
hooked into my system!

1038
01:36:52,508 --> 01:36:54,051
Yes, sir.

1039
01:37:12,361 --> 01:37:15,698
Get out of the van, now.
Now!

1040
01:37:20,202 --> 01:37:21,954
Tires. Tires.

1041
01:37:38,804 --> 01:37:40,931
Our search yielded no suspects.

1042
01:37:41,182 --> 01:37:45,436
Nor can we determine how they
entered or exited the premises.

1043
01:37:47,938 --> 01:37:50,733
- Take your men out.
- May I suggest ...?

1044
01:37:50,941 --> 01:37:52,443
Now.

1045
01:37:52,818 --> 01:37:55,905
It's your vault.
Blue team, move it out!

1046
01:38:04,455 --> 01:38:06,749
Walsh, where are
we with the van?

1047
01:38:25,059 --> 01:38:27,937
I just want to try
something for a second.

1048
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:31,565
There's nobody inside.

1049
01:38:33,234 --> 01:38:38,197
- I'm sorry. Did you want to get in?
- Enough monkey business.

1050
01:38:38,406 --> 01:38:40,032
Do it already.

1051
01:38:55,423 --> 01:38:58,551
Mr. Benedict.
We took the van, sir.

1052
01:38:58,759 --> 01:38:59,802
And?

1053
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:03,347
They say there was no
money in the bags, sir.

1054
01:39:03,597 --> 01:39:05,141
What do you mean?

1055
01:39:05,349 --> 01:39:10,104
They say the bags were filled
with fliers, sir. For hookers.

1056
01:39:16,444 --> 01:39:17,570
Walsh?

1057
01:39:17,903 --> 01:39:19,739
Cue the tape to the robbery.

1058
01:39:22,324 --> 01:39:24,869
Yes, sir.
I'm looking at the tape now.

1059
01:39:25,619 --> 01:39:29,165
Does it say "Bellagio"
on the vault floor?

1060
01:39:29,373 --> 01:39:32,001
No, it doesn't.
I don't understand.

1061
01:39:34,336 --> 01:39:36,297
We had it installed Tuesday.

1062
01:39:36,505 --> 01:39:40,176
The images we saw of those
men robbing us was a tape.

1063
01:39:40,468 --> 01:39:41,719
What?

1064
01:39:43,721 --> 01:39:47,600
It was staged. Somebody made
a duplicate of my vault.

1065
01:39:47,808 --> 01:39:51,937
What we saw on the monitor
wasn't actually happening.

1066
01:39:53,022 --> 01:39:56,901
I don 't understand.
What happened to all that money?

1067
01:40:07,453 --> 01:40:08,746
Make the call.

1068
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:18,422
911 emergency response.

1069
01:40:22,176 --> 01:40:24,303
- Night goggles on.
- Clear.

1070
01:40:24,512 --> 01:40:26,013
Prepare to cut power.

1071
01:40:31,143 --> 01:40:33,687
Breaching elevator doors now.

1072
01:40:34,063 --> 01:40:37,274
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1073
01:40:37,483 --> 01:40:38,651
Wait a minute.

1074
01:40:38,859 --> 01:40:40,653
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1075
01:40:40,945 --> 01:40:43,698
- Take him down, now!
- I got him!

1076
01:41:32,371 --> 01:41:33,497
Open the door.

1077
01:41:39,837 --> 01:41:43,799
Hey, Benedict.
How's the other fight going?

1078
01:41:49,513 --> 01:41:50,598
Pick him up.

1079
01:41:59,857 --> 01:42:01,776
Did you have a hand in this?

1080
01:42:03,027 --> 01:42:05,363
Did I have my hand in what?

1081
01:42:09,992 --> 01:42:12,036
I'll ask you one more time.

1082
01:42:12,286 --> 01:42:14,538
Did you have a hand in this?

1083
01:42:17,416 --> 01:42:21,420
Benedict, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1084
01:42:25,883 --> 01:42:27,301
Okay.

1085
01:42:28,552 --> 01:42:30,429
You're free to go.

1086
01:42:32,515 --> 01:42:34,266
Show him out.

1087
01:42:40,898 --> 01:42:43,567
- Hello.
- Turn to channel 88.

1088
01:42:43,776 --> 01:42:45,528
Who is this?

1089
01:42:54,537 --> 01:42:57,248
What happened, Benedict?
You get robbed?

1090
01:42:57,456 --> 01:42:58,958
Stop.

1091
01:43:09,969 --> 01:43:12,430
I'll give you one last chance.

1092
01:43:13,514 --> 01:43:14,765
Where's my money?

1093
01:43:14,974 --> 01:43:18,144
What if I said you could
get your money back ...

1094
01:43:19,019 --> 01:43:21,021
if you give up Tess?

1095
01:43:21,605 --> 01:43:23,566
What would you say?

1096
01:43:26,610 --> 01:43:27,778
I would say yes.

1097
01:43:32,825 --> 01:43:34,118
All right.

1098
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,165
I know a guy.
We were in the joint together.

1099
01:43:39,373 --> 01:43:43,627
Anybody pulls a job in the Western
U. S., he knows about it.

1100
01:43:44,253 --> 01:43:48,257
Give me 72 hours, I'll find
out who took your money.

1101
01:43:52,595 --> 01:43:54,638
You know a guy.

1102
01:43:57,349 --> 01:44:02,271
Contact the police. I'm sure he's
in violation of his parole.

1103
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,981
Yes, sir.

1104
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,342
Tess.

1105
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,804
Tess.

1106
01:44:35,429 --> 01:44:37,973
You of all people
should know, Terry.

1107
01:44:38,182 --> 01:44:42,019
In your hotel, there's
always someone watching.

1108
01:46:22,453 --> 01:46:24,038
Wait!

1109
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:26,165
Wait!

1110
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:30,628
Wait, that's my husband!

1111
01:46:34,048 --> 01:46:37,468
- Danny.
- Tess, I told you ...

1112
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:40,721
I knew what I was doing.

1113
01:46:41,597 --> 01:46:43,099
I didn't.

1114
01:46:43,307 --> 01:46:45,101
All right, let's go.

1115
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:48,104
How long will you be?

1116
01:46:48,312 --> 01:46:50,815
About three to six months, I guess.

1117
01:49:46,365 --> 01:49:48,325
I hope you were the groom.

1118
01:49:51,537 --> 01:49:55,291
Ted Nugent called.
He wants his shirt back.

1119
01:50:02,923 --> 01:50:07,303
Thirteen million and you drive
this piece of shit to pick me up?

1120
01:50:07,511 --> 01:50:09,346
I blew it all on the suit.

1121
01:50:09,555 --> 01:50:13,768
- Where are they?
- Back row, silver sedan. Ten o'clock.

1122
01:50:14,018 --> 01:50:17,772
I picked up your personal
effects. Hope you don't mind.

1123
01:50:20,274 --> 01:50:22,735
I'm not sure these belong to me.

1124
01:50:33,662 --> 01:50:35,122
- Hi.
- Hi.

1125
01:50:35,331 --> 01:50:36,665
Rusty needs a girl.

1126
01:50:36,874 --> 01:50:39,710
There's a women's
prison down the road.

1127
01:50:41,337 --> 01:50:43,381
You said that you sold this.

1128
01:50:43,589 --> 01:50:45,216
I said that.

1129
01:50:45,508 --> 01:50:46,967
Liar.

1130
01:50:48,677 --> 01:50:50,054
Thief.
