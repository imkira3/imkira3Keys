after we ate.

784
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:45,740
We're the Wolverines.

785
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,544
I was afraid of that.

786
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:59,755
So how did we get here?
What happened to our defense?

787
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:01,221
It went defunct.

788
01:05:01,463 --> 01:05:02,623
Shit-ified.

789
01:05:02,764 --> 01:05:04,061
There's a new class of weapon.

790
01:05:04,432 --> 01:05:06,866
It caused a massive electrical pulse.

791
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,033
Everything went off-line
and never came back.

792
01:05:09,304 --> 01:05:11,329
Grids fried, subs drowned.

793
01:05:11,873 --> 01:05:15,001
They mopped up by hitting cities
with tactical non-nuke warheads

794
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:18,004
and landed ground troops
where they needed strategic pressure.

795
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:19,578
What about the Russians?

796
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:21,461
Shit, they got the whole Eastern seaboard.

797
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,877
We know they supplied hardware
and aircraft,

798
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:26,419
but North Korea locked down
the Pacific Northwest.

799
01:05:27,822 --> 01:05:29,153
So it's over?

800
01:05:29,257 --> 01:05:30,519
Over?

801
01:05:30,825 --> 01:05:32,383
What is this?

802
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:34,221
A rifle.

803
01:05:34,362 --> 01:05:37,923
That's right, motard. A
marine and his rifle.

804
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,935
It's the baddest shit-kicking weapon
in the world.

805
01:05:42,037 --> 01:05:45,268
And I'm still breathing, so it ain't over.

806
01:05:45,707 --> 01:05:47,072
Far from it.

807
01:05:47,275 --> 01:05:49,607
Lucky for us, they bit off
more than they could chew.

808

A lot of this country is still free
and up for a fight.

Hoorah.

810
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:55,806
Michigan to Montana, Alabama to Arizona,

811
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:57,817
that's still free America right now.

812
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:00,146

You are the difference.

01:06:22,777 --> 01:06:24,472
So how can we help?

821
01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:28,146
What we can't figure out is how come
they're not crippled by their own weapon.

822

like this?

What is it?

It's how they talk to each other.
A closed network for communication.

828
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,283
So it can't be hacked.

829

But if we had it,

830
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:08,346
it'd be the foothold we need

Go, go, go, go!

945
01:22:01,142 --> 01:22:03,042
Move your asses!

946
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:09,317
<font color="#D900D9">(PULLS GRENADE PIN)</font>

947
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,218
Let's go!

948
01:22:22,964 --> 01:22:24,295
Smith!

949
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,815
How did they know?

950
01:23:24,559 --> 01:23:26,959
How did they know where we were, bro?

951
01:23:27,162 --> 01:23:28,720
- They must have followed us.
- No.

952
01:23:29,264 --> 01:23:30,754
No way they could track us.

953
01:23:39,407 --> 01:23:41,068
Daryl, lift up your jacket.

954
01:23:42,677 --> 01:23:44,304
Let me see this. Let me see it.

955
01:23:46,581 --> 01:23:48,310
Oh, shit.

956
01:23:48,817 --> 01:23:50,478
What is it?

957
01:23:50,952 --> 01:23:52,146
It's not a knife wound.

958
01:23:53,855 --> 01:23:55,117
They tagged him with something.

959
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:56,915
Like what they do with animals.

960
01:23:57,525 --> 01:23:58,719
What?

961
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,359
They're tracking him?

962
01:24:01,196 --> 01:24:02,629
Daryl.

963
01:24:03,064 --> 01:24:04,122
You...

964
01:24:04,232 --> 01:24:05,631
- No.
- You led them right to us.

965
01:24:05,834 --> 01:24:08,894
- I didn't know!
- You led them right to us!

966
01:24:09,237 --> 01:24:10,795
Let go!

967
01:24:11,706 --> 01:24:13,196
You killed Jed!

968
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:17,838
Matty, he killed Jed.

969
01:24:27,455 --> 01:24:30,185
You can cut it out of him, right, Robert?
Cut it out of him.

970
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:31,952
There's no way. With what?

971
01:24:32,193 --> 01:24:33,558
Matt, we got to move.

972
01:24:34,329 --> 01:24:35,569
Let's just get back in the car.

973
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:37,528
- Let's keep going.
- We can't.

974
01:24:39,267 --> 01:24:40,632
They'll find us.

975
01:24:40,969 --> 01:24:42,732
What else are we supposed to do?

976
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,203
Robert.

977
01:24:53,414 --> 01:24:55,405
Get me some gear.

978
01:24:55,717 --> 01:24:56,775
What?

979
01:24:57,085 --> 01:24:58,643
They could be here any minute.

980
01:25:04,559 --> 01:25:05,992
Daryl.

981
01:25:18,473 --> 01:25:20,031
Can I borrow your SAW?

982
01:26:14,796 --> 01:26:18,425
So anyone want a lift back
to the land of the free?

983
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:20,931
We got plenty of room.

984
01:26:22,737 --> 01:26:24,705
I'm sorry for the loss of your men.

985
01:26:25,607 --> 01:26:27,302
We've all lost something, Matt.

986
01:26:29,777 --> 01:26:31,176
You've done enough.

987
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:35,374
You've done more than enough.

988
01:26:36,451 --> 01:26:38,510
I appreciate that.

989
01:26:45,093 --> 01:26:46,924
The fact is

990
01:26:48,596 --> 01:26:50,962
we're not doing too bad

991
01:26:51,165 --> 01:26:53,326
for a bunch of kids.

992
01:26:54,035 --> 01:26:56,128
We're going to fight.

993
01:26:56,337 --> 01:26:59,773
And we're going to keep fighting
because it's easier now.

994
01:26:59,974 --> 01:27:02,943
And we're used to it.

995
01:27:03,144 --> 01:27:06,545
The rest of you are going to
have a tougher choice.

996
01:27:06,748 --> 01:27:10,149
Because we're not going to sell it to you.

997
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:13,047
It's too ugly for that.

998
01:27:13,788 --> 01:27:15,722
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,

999
01:27:15,924 --> 01:27:18,757
when you're fighting for your family,

1000
01:27:19,494 --> 01:27:21,462
it all hurts a little less

1001
01:27:22,997 --> 01:27:24,726
and makes a little more sense.

1002
01:27:26,801 --> 01:27:31,295
<i>Because for them, this is just a place.</i>

1003
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:36,132
<i>But for us, this is our home.</i>

1004
