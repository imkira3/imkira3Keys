1
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,792
Shit.

2
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,805
Okay. Humidity levels are good.
Still need thermal and infrared, though.

3
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,670
Where are those guys?

4
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,335
Cut it out.

5
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,393
Day one of our experiment into the limit
of anomalistic psychology.

6
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,757
We're attempting our own high-tech
version of the Charles Experiment.

7
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,026
Unlike the scientific séance
from the 1970s...

8
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,433
...our goal is to manifest the spirit
into our world.

9
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:17,432
- Where'd you get that?
- I made it up in Engineering.

10
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:21,773
I thought a 3D representation of Charles
would help us focus our focus.

11
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:26,111
If we pull this off,
we'll prove that ghosts, entities...

12
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,583
...and the supernatural do exist...

13
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,951
...with mass iteration of channeled,
intentional belief.

14
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,806
You think EEG amps and
headbands will make a difference?

15
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,143
Yes.

16
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:05,620
Instead of just you, me, and Lydia,
it'll be like there's 500 of us.

17
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,552
Stop talking, Greg. Concentrate.

18
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,078
- Whoa.
- Give me a break. You kicked the table.

19
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,511
I did not, I swear.

20
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,518
- Did you get that?
- Yeah, he got it. Now shut up.

21
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,818
Patrick.

22
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,029
Holy shit!

23
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,504
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

24
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,081
Lydia! Lydia! Come on!

25
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,879
Shit.

26
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,383
- What is that?
- Where's the flashlight?

27
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,491
What the hell is that? Aah! Patrick!

28
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,888
- Lydia!
- Lydia?

29
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,492
- Aah!
- Lydia!

30
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,124
Hi.

31
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,098
Now no biting.

32
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,042
Hey, you.

33
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,651
<i>Is your car out of the shop yet?</i>

34
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,913
Of course not.
You think you can rescue me again?

35
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,147
<i>Why not?</i>

36
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,656
Kind of like being the hero. I love you.

37
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,259
Me too.

38
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,826
Let's try to get it right this time.

39
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,492
Uh, no problem.

40
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,772
Hey, stranger.

41
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,515
You hungry?

42
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,811
It depends what you're in the mood for.

43
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,190
The last four days we've covered
China, India, Vietnam...

44
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,189
...Ethiopia.

45
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,528
Okay. You choose.

46
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,695
What exotic land
do you wanna visit tonight?

47
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,002
Can we go to Costco after this?

48
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,673
I wanna get a giant saguaro
for the front yard.

49
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,872
What the hell is a saguaro?

50
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,042
It's a cactus.

51
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,449
You think they even have them?

52
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,777
Mm. I mean, you would think so.

53
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,884
You don't think so?

54
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,390
How are you gonna fit a giant saguaro
in the back of your car?

55
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,562
What was that for?

56
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,562
You get happy and be nice.

57
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,828
- I had a bad day at work, all right?
- So?

58
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,164
Get over it.

59
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,067
Would you quit it?

60
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,970
Okay.

61
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,242
So I guess I'm buying you a cactus.

62
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,887
I could always work here
if things don't work out.

63
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,081
Oh, stop it.

64
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,592
You can do that techie thing for a while.
It's not gonna kill you.

65
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,095
At least you're not picking up dog poop.

66
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,592
Hey, look.

67
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,591
What do we need that for?

68
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,761
Could come in handy.

69
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,101
We'll use it once,
then it's gonna end up in the garage.

70
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,106
You can't have a problem with this.

71
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,773
It's cute, it's cheap,
super low-maintenance.

72
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,612
Just like you.

73
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,583
Hmm. Look where we are.

74
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,790
Not the camping thing again. I...

75
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,452
Before my dad first took me,
I thought I'd hate it.

76
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,465
I like the outdoors, but sleeping
in a tent on the ground...

77
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,130
Who said anything about sleeping?

78
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,147
When you were a little girl, I bet your
dream was to live in Palmdale, wasn't it?

79
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,321
Of course.

80
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,324
Abandoned neighborhoods,
vacant strip malls...

81
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:47,090
...empty desert for miles
in every direction.

82
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,823
What girl doesn't dream about that?

83
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,303
- Who was that?
- Work.

84
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,838
- Hi, neighbors.
- Hey.

85
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,507
How's the unpacking going?

86
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,051
Well, we're getting there, sort of.

87
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,717
Hey, Pepper. Come on, girl. Pepper.

88
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,549
Watch out for this one.
She likes to roam.

89
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,323
How are you, Miss Maggie?

90
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,519
Good.

91
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,165
- This is my boyfriend, Ben.
- Good to meet you, Ben.

92
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,391
- Hi.
- Hello.

93
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,502
- See you guys soon?
- Yeah, see you soon.

94
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,830
All right, come on.

95
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,997
When did you find time to start
the welcoming committee?

96
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,474
Well, it wasn't that hard,
considering they're our only neighbors.

97
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,248
Hey, Mom.

98
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,086
Um, I'm watching your video right now.

99
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,854
- Uh-huh.
- Damn it! Where is it?

100
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,194
That was Ben. He can't find something.

101
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,262
Yes, Mom, were excellent tenants.

102
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,566
We're taking good care
of your investment home.

103
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,005
Your parents should be happy
they found renters...

104
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,372
...especially responsible ones like us.

105
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,942
We're still settling in...

106
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,243
...but I got new curtains for the bedroom
and I ordered a...

107
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,614
Oh, son of a bitch!

108
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,753
You know what, I gotta go.
Give Dad a kiss?

109
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,456
Okay. I love you too.

110
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,571
My cactus. It's dead.

111
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,967
So we'll return it.

112
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:13,133
No, it cost four dollars and we'd spend
twice that much just taking it back.

113
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,141
<i>Fight!</i>

114
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,386
I am schooling you right now.

115
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,319
<i>- It ain't over yet.</i>
- Stop.

116
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,982
Stop.

117
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,655
<i>- K.O.!</i>
- Ugh!

118
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:32,990
Yes! Ha, ha.

119
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,831
Ugh! I need a beer.

120
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,496
Why don't you get me one? Loser.

121
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,682
Armed.

122
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,191
Did you burn something?

123
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,189
Oh, right, because I cook so often.

124
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,866
But you noticed it...

125
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,998
...you clean it.

126
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,195
Thank you.

127
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,515
Ben.

128
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,215
Ben.

129
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,257
- Wake up.
- What?

130
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,889
- Let me fall asleep? I missed the ending.
- Shh.

131
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,187
What's the matter?

132
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,239
Why are the doors open?

133
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,244
I don't know.

134
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,797
Did you set the alarm?

135
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,100
You watched me set it.

136
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,696
I'm gonna look around.

137
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm calling the security company.

138
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,701
Okay.

139
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,040
Good night. Thanks again.

140
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,549
<i>No sign of forced entry.
The alarm's working fine.</i>

141
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,778
They said some kids have been
messing around the empty homes.

142
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,719
It's probably just a stupid prank.

143
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,787
We're changing the locks.

144
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,483
- Up, sleepyhead. Come on, I need the sheets.
- Oh...

145
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,320
- Kelly. Come here. Come here.
- Ha, ha.

146
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,663
What time is it?

147
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,996
Nine. The hardware store opens at eight.

148
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,673
New deadbolts, remember?

149
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,207
Yeah. Yeah, <i>yeah,</i> yeah.

150
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,111
Did you get any sleep?

151
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,873
A little.

152
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,856
We're out of toothpaste.

153
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,185
Yeah, we need a lot of things.

154
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,456
You know what, can you make a...

155
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,360
What?

156
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,630
What?

157
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,032
Finish your sentence.

158
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,643
Oh, a list.

159
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,172
What's shaking?

160
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:20,007
Ah, just installing some
new security cameras.

161
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,341
All the locks are changed too.

162
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,339
You're pretty great, you know that?

163
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,977
You finally noticed?

164
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:17,190
- I really tweaked my back.
- Okay. All right, Dr. Mason.

165
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,565
Hey, don't jinx me. I'm not a vet yet.

166
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,637
You will be.

167
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,674
Now, if you can lose this top,
we can get started.

168
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,579
Ah, take a look. We have a visitor.

169
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,488
Pepper, come.

170
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,558
Pepper!

171
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,228
Pepper!

172
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,763
Let's go.

173
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,423
What could've happened to her?

174
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,757
Oh, my God, she's barely breathing.
Let's get her some help.

175
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,980
Mike, I'm so sorry.

176
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,484
We tried to help her, but...

177
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,089
I appreciate everything you've done.
There's nothing more you can do.

178
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,658
Look at this.

179
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,693
The linoleum's cracked.

180
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,349
Watch out for spiders.

181
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,249
Thanks.

182
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,724
What the hell?

183
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,219
Ben?

184
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,048
Ben?

185
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,216
Ben?

186
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,168
Did you find anyone?

187
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:57,677
So far, none of the mold inspectors
can come by for at least a week.

188
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:01,682
Great. I'm gonna wash up.
You wanna go first?

189
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,444
I'm gonna keep searching.

190
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,390
<i>We're attempting
to contain and entrap the entity...</i>

191
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,965
<i>...we manifested a few years ago.</i>

192
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,261
<i>This is where our experiment
will be happening.</i>

193
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:03,467
<i>We'll use these devices to detect our
entity when he makes his appearance.</i>

194
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,366
<i>The four of us will be
wearing these headsets.</i>

195
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:11,137
<i>They'll capture our belief
and channel it into here.</i>

196
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,574
<i>Utilizing our equipment, I'm going to
amplify the brainwaves of the participants.</i>

197
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,085
<i>There'll be four people
sitting around the table...</i>

198
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,723
<i>...but this will make it seem like
four thousand.</i>

199
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,292
<i>And all of this concentrated energy
will be focused into there.</i>

200
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:29,463
<i>My modern and altered version of
a psychomanteum, or apparition chamber.</i>

201
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:34,232
<i>The electric current acts as an amplifier
as it runs through the cages.</i>

202
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,672
<i>Entities manifest themselves
through energy.</i>

203
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,811
<i>The greater the energy,
the greater the chance of manifestation.</i>

204
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,673
<i>We miscalculated the first time...</i>

205
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:46,078
<i>...but now we'll be able to trap the spirit
within the psychomanteum.</i>

206
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:53,513
<i>Greg!</i>

207
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,020
<i>Greg? Greg? Greg, where are you?</i>

208
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,290
<i>Greg! Greg!</i>

209
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,545
<i>Our effort to entrap it has failed.</i>

210
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,515
<i>I'm not sure what we've done,
but something came through.</i>

211
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:34,357
<i>We've brought it into our world.
Now it's loose. It's free.</i>

212
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,089
<i>We should never have done this.</i>

213
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,661
Ben?

214
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:07,853
Yeah?

215
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,430
What?

216
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,681
Ben, maybe we should
just call the cops.

217
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,739
Where are you going?
We can't just abandon our house.

218
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,536
- Yes, we can!
- You're not even dressed!

219
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,544
There is no way I'm staying
in this house tonight!

220
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,582
If it were a person, we would have seen
them come in on the security cameras.

221
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,223
I must have left a blind spot.

222
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,118
Why aren't we saying
what we're both thinking?

223
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,626
Kel. Our house is too new to be haunted.
It has no history.

224
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,123
Those hangers. What could do that?

225
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,528
And those voices.

226
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,605
There's gotta be an explanation.

227
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:41,609
Hey, at least you finally got me camping.

228
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,979
Promise you'll stay awake?

229
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,445
Promise.

230
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,412
All night?

231
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,883
All night.

232
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,715
Hey! Listen.

233
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,380
I know last night was rough.

234
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,656
Everything is gonna be okay.

235
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,829
Houses make weird noises.

236
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,521
Maybe some animal got inside.

237
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,724
I'm gonna stay home today, I'll clean up...

238
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,392
...call someone to check out the closet.

239
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,866
And then what?

240
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:03,805
Do you wanna leave?

241
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,044
No.

242
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:13,311
My parents are counting on us
to look after their place.

243
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,350
I can't tell them their house is haunted.

244
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,684
Have a great day at work.

245
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,025
If anything else happens...

246
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,719
...I'll get us a hotel.

247
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,523
I promise.

248
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:38,439
Hey, neighbors.

249
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,176
Maggie, I'm so sorry about Pepper.

250
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:47,516
But this little guy really needs
a good home, so...

251
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,659
...I thought of you.

252
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,851
- Can I?
- Yeah, I don't see why not.

253
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,353
- You didn't have to.
- No, I...

254
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,022
I did.

255
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,933
Have you noticed anything weird
happening in your house lately?

256
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,299
Such as?

257
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,705
Lights going on and off,
doors opening by themselves, molds?

258
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,708
Sounds like shoddy construction.

259
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,040
- Oh, damn it.
- What?

260
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,375
We have the same builder.

261
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,680
And do you mind just letting me know
if anything happens?

262
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,221
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

263
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,835
Maggie! You scared me.

264
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,868
Your house killed my dog.

265
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,735
<i>Okay. Humidity levels are good.</i>

266
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:23,674
<i>Still need thermal and infrared, though.
Where are those guys?</i>

267
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:25,606
<i>Cut it out.</i>

268
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,851
<i>- Are peripherals online and ready?</i>
<i>- All set.</i>

269
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,853
<i>All right. Let's light this candle.</i>

270
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,321
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Shit!</i>

271
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:21,401
<i>Lydia, come on. Lydia, come on!</i>

272
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,233
<i>- Where's the flashlight?</i>
<i>- What the hell is that?</i>

273
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,673
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- Lydia!</i>

274
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,580
<i>Lydia! Lydia!</i>

275
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,922
<i>Oh, my God. Shut that thing off!</i>

276
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,058
<i>I said, shut that thing off!</i>

277
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,456
I can explain.

278
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,593
This girl, Lydia?

279
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,959
You two were together?

280
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,795
Not the way you and I are, but...

281
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:32,939
...yes.

282
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,099
What happened to her?

283
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:37,769
She's, um...

284
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:42,476
Gone.

285
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,983
"Gone"?

286
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:46,811
What does that mean, "gone"?

287
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,616
Like she's dead?

288
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,259
- Is that what will happen to me?
- Nothing will happen.

289
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,554
How do you know that?
How can I trust you?

290
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:58,131
- What is this? What is in my house?
- I honestly don't know, okay?

291
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:02,331
We were trying to contact something
from the other side.

292
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,996
We were in college,
it was just an experiment.

293
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,164
Why didn't you tell me about this?

294
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:10,437
You knew what was happening
and you didn't tell me!

295
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,844
I mean, I don't know,
maybe I'm part of this experiment too.

296
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:15,746
No. This is all in the past.

297
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,352
I thought if you didn't know about it,
you'd be safe.

298
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:23,515
In my own way, I was trying to protect you.

299
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:26,186
I'm sorry.

300
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,524
How am I supposed to believe
anything you say?

301
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,689
Get out of my house!

302
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,862
Get out now!

303
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,190
Patrick.

304
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,062
It's Ben.

305
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,568
Call me.

306
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,758
What are you?

307
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,984
- Get off me!
- Stop! Look at me!

308
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,726
Stop! Stop! Look at me!

309
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,365
Still no answer from Patrick.

310
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:05,574
We're safe now.

311
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:11,348
What else can I do?

312
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,515
You can get off the bed.

313
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,314
Kelly!

314
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:32,219
Come on!

315
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:53,211
It's okay. It's okay.

316
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:02,849
Where are we going?

317
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,762
It's Patrick.

318
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:28,780
Your house isn't haunted. You are.

319
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,180
By the ghost we contacted.

320
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,913
If it is a ghost, it's not the ghost
of anything human.

321
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,285
What does it want from us?

322
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:38,957
Exactly what it's getting.

323
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:43,189
It wants to be in our world.
It wants us. It feeds on life.

324
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:47,301
It'll punish you, it'll manipulate the way
you see the world, and it takes you.

325
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,301
We opened the door and it came through.

326
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,873
What door?

327
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,967
A rift between our world and theirs.

328
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:57,806
Our second session opened it more.

329
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,476
What the hell were you thinking?

330
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,919
Yeah, at least I didn't run away,
act like it never happened.

331
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:08,147
- That's not what I did and you know it.
- We tried something new.

332
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:10,155
We tried to contain it.

333
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,650
Remember the psychomanteum?

334
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,957
I've rerouted the current <i>so</i> it gives off
a negative magnetic field.

335
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:18,828
Like a bomb shelter for brain waves.

336
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:21,299
I've been living in there for weeks.

337
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,267
That's perfect.

338
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,431
The only way to protect ourselves
is to live in a box.

339
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,617
We still have a chance to end it here.

340
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:40,982
How?

341
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,627
Place these transmitters
everywhere you saw it try to manifest.

342
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,525
Anywhere it's tried to get a foothold.

343
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,860
I recorded the EEG emissions
of our experiment.

344
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,198
We're gonna use that power against it.

345
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,838
We'll play the recording
of the session in reverse.

346
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:03,501
I'm gonna tap into the power lines
and feed all that energy into our system.

347
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:07,205
Four thousand minds put this together.
Four hundred thousand can destroy it.

348
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,724
Instead of aiming the transmitters in,
we aim them at us...

349
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,695
...and the house too.

350
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:30,361
With us inside, we flood every inch.

351
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:31,699
Open everything, right?

352
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:34,502
The fridge, the microwave,
the dishwasher, everything.

353
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:43,716
In the first experiment, our amplified
EEG-is, they acted like a key.

354
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:46,680
In the second, we opened a gateway.

355
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:50,025
We can reverse this process. If we can
link the two recordings, we can...

356
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,889
Amplify and transmit the EEGs in reverse.

357
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:58,261
And with all the additional power,
we shut the door and we turn the lock.

358
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:06,364
Okay.

359
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,343
Ben! Ben, help me!

360
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,308
Ben!

361
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,111
Ben!

362
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,349
Ben! Ben, help me!

363
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,176
Ben!

364
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,045
Ben! Ben!

365
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,813
Ben!

366
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:01,879
Ben! Ben, help me!

367
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:03,716
Move back!

368
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,851
EEG transmitters linking.

369
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:44,361
Initiating reverse playback.

370
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,552
Linking process complete.

371
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,278
Amplifying transmitter feed.

372
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,972
EMF readings are high.
Tapping into the main grid.

373
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,491
Did it work?

374
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:50,556
It's a really quiet neighborhood.
It's about 3400 square feet.

375
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,902
Here's directions to my house.

376
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:14,545
The safe room. Just in case.

377
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,382
Thanks.

378
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:20,081
- I'm gonna take this out.
- I'll help you with that.

379
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,785
Two days and nothing freaky at all.

380
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,789
We got a life again, right?

381
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,587
One day at a time.

382
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:02,627
I'll take that.

383
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,181
Don't ever say that, ever.

384
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:04,750
Patrick!

385
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,653
Patrick!

386
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,234
Patrick's gone.

387
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,785
We gotta go to Patrick's.

388
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:51,626
He lived in that thing you guys built,
that chamber.

389
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:57,371
Patrick said he built it to keep
this thing out. We'll be safe there.

390
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,762
Then what?

391
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,431
I don't know! But I'm not giving up.

392
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:59,598
<i>The lack of pattern...</i>

393
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:01,531
<i>...leads me to believe
it's toying with us.</i>

394
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:05,104
<i>It toyed with the members of the '70s
séance and it's toying with Greg and I.</i>

395
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,765
<i>Of the six people who performed
the '70s experiment, two died...</i>

396
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:11,879
<i>...one committed suicide
and three went missing.</i>

397
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,839
<i>I didn't tell Ben or the others.
I couldn't.</i>

398
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:19,482
<i>This knowledge might have tainted
our results. But now I see I was wrong.</i>

399
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:23,055
<i>This thing is older than
any demon or ghost.</i>

400
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:25,454
<i>It's been trapped in purgatory
for an eternity.</i>

401
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:28,391
<i>But I believe that purgatory
contains not just human souls...</i>

402
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:31,327
<i>...but countless entities
and malevolent spirits.</i>

403
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,701
<i>I've done my best
to figure out what this is...</i>

404
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:36,064
<i>...but from what I can tell,
it doesn't have a name.</i>

405
01:06:36,226 --> 01:06:38,570
<i>I've tried to understand
its attack pattern...</i>

406
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,730
<i>...a logic that I can use
for our benefit...</i>

407
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:42,137
Patrick's journals.

408
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,402
<i>...there is none.</i>

409
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,568
<i>And that scares me to death.</i>

410
01:06:45,902 --> 01:06:49,679
<i>For the whole of human existence,
people have believed in the supernatural.</i>

411
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:53,320
<i>Ghosts and spirits. Angels and demons.</i>

412
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,012
<i>What we will prove...</i>

413
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:58,250
<i>...is that the supernatural is actually
part of the natural world.</i>

414
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,917
<i>It is something you can
quantify and qualify.</i>

415
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:03,655
<i>It isn't magic, it is science.</i>

416
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,595
<i>And we will make contact.</i>

417
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:09,362
<i>The human body is essentially
a walking battery full of bio-energy...</i>

418
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,938
<i>...particularly that which is
generated by the brain.</i>

419
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:00,283
Ben, please. How long...

420
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:27,339
Kelly.

421
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:32,410
<i>The first sounds acted as
a beacon, drawing the entity to our world.</i>

422
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,342
<i>Then we allowed it to cross over.</i>

423
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:39,919
<i>It's clear to me that it wants what it doesn't have.
It wants to exist in our plane.</i>

424
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:45,089
<i>It's getting stronger.
With each person it takes, it gets smarter.</i>

425
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,088
<i>More powerful. It's learning about us.</i>

426
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:52,759
<i>We cannot tell what is real
and what is our imagination.</i>

427
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,559
<i>We believed we were studying this entity...</i>

428
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,233
<i>...but this whole time,
it's been studying us...</i>

429
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:02,103
<i>...testing our defenses,
our weaknesses.</i>

430
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:07,109
<i>This is but the first of them.
They are entering our world.</i>

431
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,276
<i>They are taking life.
We opened the door...</i>

432
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,714
<i>...and now it's too late to stop it.</i>
- Ben!

433
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:18,791
<i>It wears you down until you can't
resist any more. And then it takes you.</i>
