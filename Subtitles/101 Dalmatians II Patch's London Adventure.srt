There, there. I know you'll get it right,
my depressive da Vinci.

473
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,620
You simply have to keep trying.

474
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:54,208
Аfter all, you're the only one
who truly understands Cruella,

475
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,045
who can see into her tortured soul.

476
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,379
Yes!

477
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:04,927
Her heart is like a vast, dark ocean
on whose waves I am hopelessly adrift

478
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,930
in my dinghy of passion.

(CHUCKLES)

480
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:14,978
I shall not betray your faith in me!
I shall create another canvas!

481
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,481
And another!
And another! And another!

482
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,360
Until I have found spotted perfection!

483
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:28,116
I shall not stop until the fires
of your craving have been quenched.

484
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:34,039
Junior deputy test?
Which episode was that in?

485
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,415
One of the lost episodes.

486
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,753
But I only give it to pups
who I think might be worthy.

487
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,089
And, who knows, if you do real good,

488
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,259
maybe I'll even let you
be on the show with me!

-Sure, kid. I'm the star, aren't I?

That stagecoach is out of control!

00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,105
This is your first junior deputy test, kid.

493
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,524
Okay, well...

494
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:05,279
This is just like in episode 37,
"Stagecoaches of Serpent Summit."

495
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:11,118
Very good. Now, episode 37, was that
the one where I leap, run and pounce?

496
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,871
No, no. That was the one
where you run, pounce and leap!

497
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,456
Precisely! Stand back!

blow right

So if you get one try and that don't fly
Stop and count to 10

And if at first you don't succeed
Try again

If at first you don't succeed, yeah

-Yes, my friend

-Aren't those monkeys?
-Even worse, monkey rustlers!
