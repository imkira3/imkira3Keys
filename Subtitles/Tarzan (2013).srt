<i>The amazing story I'm
about to tell you...</i>

3
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:35,566
<i>took place in the deepest and
darkest parts of Africa.</i>

4
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:40,607
<i>It is the tale of a young boy from
New York who lost everything...</i>

5
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:42,891
<i>to become the King of the Jungle.</i>

6
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,168
<i>But let's start at the beginning.</i>

7
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:56,807
<i>To be precise, 70 million
years earlier...</i>

8
00:00:57,204 --> 00:01:00,487
<i>when the great dinosaurs
ruled the Earth.</i>

9
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:40,573
<i>An American named Greystoke set up
camp at the edge of the jungle.</i>

10
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:43,209
<i>He spent weeks in
search of the meteor,</i>

11
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:45,326
<i>while his family enjoyed
the wilderness.</i>

12
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:47,849
See, Kagira?
I told you he'd be back.

13
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:52,055
<i>J.J.</i>

14
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:54,138
J.J., where are you?

15
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:58,017
Yeah, Mom?

16
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:02,128
Come on. Enough fun!
It's time to eat. Come on, J.J.

17
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,412
J.J.? Who's J.J.? My name's Tarzan!

18
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:07,048
Kagira gave me the name.

19
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,651
It's ape language.
It means "ape with no fur".

20
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:13,655
That makes sense, little monkey.

21
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,497
Hey, guys! Wait for Tarzan!

22
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,811
<i>Greystoke was financing
the expedition...</i>

23
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,498
<i>and he had become pretty impatient.</i>

24
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,860
<i>Nothing. There's nothing here.</i>

25
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:32,979
Wow. That wall of fog again.

26
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,780
My instruments are going haywire.

27
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:38,298
Okay, that's it. Expedition's over.

28
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:41,702
There's absolutely no sign of your
mysterious meteor here, Porter.

29
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,422
Great. Just great.

30
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:53,651
<i>They would probably
never find this meteor,</i>

31
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,851
<i>which according to
ancient folklore...</i>

32
00:02:55,852 --> 00:03:00,422
<i>possesses limitless power and
is guarded by wild monkeys.</i>

33
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:03,819
<i>And who knows what other
amazing secrets...</i>

34
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:07,462
<i>may lay deep within
that mysterious rock.</i>

35
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:16,583
The power of the meteor is
supposed to be beyond imagination.

36
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:20,057
John, we have to
continue our search.

37
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:23,702
Jim, wake up.
It's just a local legend.

38
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:26,495
We've searched every
square inch of this place.

39
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:28,976
And the reports of the
19th century explorers?

40
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:31,536
Are the romantic fantasies
of treasure hunters.

41
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,137
And this?

42
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:38,185
A lump of metal from a flea
market bin Kigali isn't proof.

43
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:40,943
A word of advice between friends?

44
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:44,180
Take down your tent and come
back to New York with us.

45
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,415
You've got a beautiful wife waiting
there, and a lovely daughter.

46
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,266
And they are real, Porter.

47
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:52,423
If this meteor really
exists, it's not here.

48
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,264
Listen!

49
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,427
I'm Tarzan.

50
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:01,907
When I come back, I'm gonna
be King of the Jungle!

51
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:05,100
Tarzan?

52
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:07,698
He made it up.

53
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:10,544
Your son's got quite the
imagination. You know that?

54
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:13,538
Must get that from your
end of the gene pool.

55
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:15,024
Incorrigible dreamer, huh?

56
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:18,228
Is there any other reason why you've
dragged us to the end of the world?

57
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:20,707
Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!

58
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:22,065
J.J., what...?

59
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:31,065
- You sure you want to stay?
- You still don't get it.

60
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,190
- The jungle's my life.
- You take care.

61
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,306
Kiss Jane for me!

62
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,826
John! Look! Down there.

63
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,029
A loner. A mountain gorilla
looking for a new family.

64
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,951
Very, very dangerous.

65
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:00,912
<i>You don't wanna mess with that guy.</i>

66
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:08,621
<i>By the giant waterfall,</i>

67
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,745
<i>which had carved a deep
gorge in the jungle...</i>

68
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:14,506
<i>one of the few remaining
families of mountain gorillas...</i>

69
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,506
<i>lived in peace and harmony.</i>

70
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:19,501
<i>But even their secluded hideaway...</i>

71
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,502
<i>could not protect them
from the angry loner...</i>

72
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:24,547
<i>and the hunt for a family
to take as his own.</i>

73
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:40,152
<i>And so the silverbacks
had to fight.</i>

74
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:22,719
<i>Look at all this volcanic activity!</i>

75
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:24,919
Wow! This wasn't here two days ago!

76
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:43,354
There's some kind of
magnetic interference.

77
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:48,640
What is this place?

78
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:05,485
<i>Get us outta here!</i>

79
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:09,685
<i>- We're gonna hit the wall!</i>
- I'll pull her up!

80
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:14,604
<i>Come on, come on.!
Hold on, everyone!</i>

81
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:27,079
My God. Porter was right.

82
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:31,044
Chris, land the bird.
I've gotta check this out.

83
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:38,805
- I'll be back in an hour.
- One hour.

84
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:41,076
It's getting late, okay?

85
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:45,443
This place is, I don't
know, it's creepy.

86
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:48,198
It's otherworldly, huh? Come on.

87
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:53,401
Hey, Tarzan, Kagira,
you're in charge.

88
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:56,967
- Say "bye", Kagira.
- Bye bye.

89
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:07,804
Kagira told me he had a
bad dream last night.

90
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:11,447
Oh no. Kagira, what did you dream?

91
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,443
You left him behind in the jungle.

92
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,358
Oh, silly Kagira. We would
never leave you behind.

93
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,606
You promise?

94
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,680
I promise.

95
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,721
<i>Alice!</i>

96
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,801
<i>Alice! Alice, I found it!</i>

97
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,925
- John? What is it?
<i>- A cave.</i>

98
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,527
<i>A cave? Are you going in there?</i>

99
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,086
I have to.

100
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,047
I'll be back soon.

101
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,405
<i>And as John stepped into this most
inhospitable world cloaked in fog...</i>

102
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:43,080
<i>the guardian monkeys protecting
the meteor for eons...</i>

103
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,010
<i>became more and more agitated.</i>

104
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:53,089
<i>This secret, which had been
dormant for millions of years...</i>

105
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:55,491
<i>was about to be uncovered.</i>

106
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:55,808
John?

107
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:58,694
Can you hear me? Where are you?

108
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,337
We really have to leave.

109
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:18,809
<i>The ground shook,</i>

110
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:22,654
<i>and it seemed as if all the
elements were uniting...</i>

111
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:26,775
<i>to avenge the wound that John
had cut into the meteor.</i>

112
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,375
- John!
- Dad!

113
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:46,775
- What happened?
- Let's go!

114
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:47,977
What happened?

115
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,174
Get in there!

116
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:35,053
Something's pulling us down!

117
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:45,464
<i>And as the pilot battled
with the raging elements...</i>

118
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:48,585
<i>another heart-rending tragedy
took place nearby...</i>

119
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:52,663
<i>which would have momentous
consequences on things to come.</i>

120
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:40,424
You never should have ripped
that thing out of the rock.

121
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:02,581
You see that?

122
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,107
Forgive me.

123
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:29,506
Mommy!

124
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:58,546
<i>The next morning,
Nature had calmed down.</i>

125
00:14:59,823 --> 00:15:02,833
<i>Karla, who had lost both
husband and baby...</i>

126
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,346
<i>wandered heartbroken
through the jungle...</i>

127
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:08,385
<i>when she came across
a strange object...</i>

128
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:11,184
<i>which had fallen from the
sky the night before.</i>

129
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:39,113
<i>Mommy...?</i>

130
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:15,910
<i>And as Karla miraculously
gained a new child overnight...</i>

131
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:21,516
<i>Tarzan found a caring hand to protect
him in the unforgiving wild.</i>

132
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:23,276
<i>Karla had decided to defend
her young by any means.</i>

133
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:27,767
<i>But from the start, Tarzan had become
a thorn in the side of Tublat...</i>

134
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,959
<i>the new evil leader of
the gorilla family.</i>

135
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:42,120
<i>- Something's pulling us down!
- What's pulling us down?</i>

136
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,365
<i>Mommy!</i>

137
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,287
<i>One... Two... Three...</i>

138
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:26,731
Ready or not, here I come!

139
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:29,047
Not again.

140
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:32,532
I know you're here somewhere!

141
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:37,848
Gotcha!

142
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,770
Wait for me!

143
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:57,403
<i>As time passed, the boy once
known as J.J. Greystoke...</i>

144
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,686
<i>had all but ceased to exist.</i>

145
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:03,412
<i>And in a world where the survival
of a young boy seemed impossible...</i>

146
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:05,568
<i>he sensed a ray of hope.</i>

147
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:10,849
<i>Now he really was Tarzan,
the ape without fur.</i>

148
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:13,789
<i>Oh, what a beautiful butterfly!</i>

149
00:25:21,506 --> 00:25:24,278
Where's the gorillas?
This place blows.

150
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:41,248
Derek!

151
00:25:41,388 --> 00:25:43,192
- Psycho.
- Beanpole.

152
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:46,870
Seriously, Dad, I don't know
how you do this every summer.

153
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:48,508
They pay well.

154
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:51,716
And I guess you
develop a few tricks.

155
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:55,396
Whoopsies.

156
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:01,439
Smile, everybody!

157
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,435
Well, here we are.

158
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,755
Welcome to Camp Porter.

159
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,075
This place is a dump!

160
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:30,234
<i>You got here just in time.</i>

161
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:32,994
<i>The gorillas are getting
tired of my jokes.</i>

162
00:26:34,352 --> 00:26:36,839
I've never seen stars like this.

163
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:42,122
Just imagine, if you were a monkey,
you'd get to see this every night.

164
00:26:42,672 --> 00:26:45,478
Makes you wonder which primate
got the better deal, huh?

165
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:51,044
Do you ever think
about coming home?

166
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:53,484
To New York?

167
00:26:54,073 --> 00:26:57,436
Maybe trying things again with Mom?

168
00:26:58,273 --> 00:27:01,796
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but this is my home.

169
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:04,160
It always was.

170
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:10,525
Well, in that case, I
have to come back.

171
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:14,798
Jane, my darling, nothing
would make me happier.

172
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:24,079
Don't stay up too late, sweetheart.

173
00:27:24,955 --> 00:27:27,806
- We've got a big day tomorrow.
- Okay.

174
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:37,803
Who's there?

175
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:49,122
Oh! Hey. I was just out
here looking for birds.

176
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:54,683
- I think I'm just gonna go this way.
- I think that's a good idea.

177
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:02,280
Creep.

178
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:13,605
Now remember, everyone,
stay on the trail.

179
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,765
If you don't, we may
never find you again.

180
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,248
And more importantly, you
shouldn't make too much noise.

181
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:23,369
Unless you want to end
up on someone's menu.

182
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,041
Derek?

183
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,890
Derek, where are you?

184
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:48,763
Cool.

185
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:56,773
Listen to me, Derek.
This is very dangerous.

186
00:28:57,522 --> 00:29:01,886
You're going to walk
towards me very slowly.

187
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:05,007
And whatever you do, don't run.

188
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:11,766
Derek!

189
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:23,692
Hey! Hey! Over here! Chase me!

190
00:29:49,285 --> 00:29:50,725
It's okay, it's okay!

191
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:11,734
Who's there?

192
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:16,648
That's not good.

193
00:30:34,728 --> 00:30:36,215
Oh, come on!

194
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,210
Oh, no!

195
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:08,013
Jane!

196
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:11,451
Jane!

197
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:03,183
Jane!

198
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:04,703
Jane!

199
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:06,581
Jane!

200
00:32:15,295 --> 00:32:16,543
Who are you?

201
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,425
Jane?

202
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:52,380
Jane!

203
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:56,586
- Oh, Dad.
- You're here.

204
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:04,225
I'm not sure if he was a
boy or some kind of ape.

205
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:09,070
He had these long arms
and massive shoulders...

206
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:12,583
but the purest green eyes.

207
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,868
- Should I be concerned?
- Dad!

208
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,070
It's a jungle, not a pick-up bar.

209
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,421
Just asking.

210
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,141
I'm fine, Dad. Really.

211
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,544
It may sound weird, but in a way,
I've never felt safer in my life.

212
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,509
<i>These were just the fantasies of a little
girl growing up before her dad's eyes.</i>

213
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:35,900
<i>And she never dreamt that what she
encountered deep in the jungle...</i>

214
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:39,469
<i>- was the young Greystoke heir himself.</i>
- Bye.

215
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,669
Jane.

216
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:55,032
<i>It's ape language.
It means "Ape with no fur."</i>

217
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,630
Jane.

218
00:34:09,143 --> 00:34:10,630
Tarzan.

219
00:34:13,144 --> 00:34:14,550
Tarzan.

220
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,193
<i>- We would never leave you behind.
- You promise?</i>

221
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,090
<i>His friends tried everything
to make him feel better.</i>

222
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,282
<i>But nothing could fill the void
growing deep in Tarzan's heart.</i>

223
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:01,135
<i>And while Jane flew back
home to her mother...</i>

224
00:40:01,688 --> 00:40:06,098
<i>Tarzan was tormented by a
thousand feelings and questions.</i>

225
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:08,528
<i>His world seemed to unravel...</i>

226
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:12,700
<i>as a longing arose in him that
he had never felt before.</i>

227
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,571
<i>Years passed.
Tarzan became stronger...</i>

228
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,896
<i>and reached farther than any
other creature in the jungle.</i>

229
00:42:11,457 --> 00:42:12,465
<i>Mr. Clayton?</i>

230
00:42:13,137 --> 00:42:15,256
<i>Two hours ago, our
communication center...</i>

231
00:42:15,257 --> 00:42:17,620
<i>received a signal from
one of our helicopters.</i>

232
00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:19,066
So?

233
00:42:20,018 --> 00:42:21,344
It's Greystoke's.

234
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:24,265
Greystoke's?

235
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:27,549
After all these years. My God.

236
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:33,859
- The board's ready for you, sir.
- Thanks, Amy.

237
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:37,538
Mr. Clayton! If I could just
have a moment of your time...

238
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:39,741
I'm with the Society
for African Wildlife.

239
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:42,182
- Not again.
- Mr. Clayton!

240
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,819
Twenty years ago, John Greystoke
made a commitment to conservation.

241
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,184
All we're asking is a small grant,
less than 1% of your annual profits.

242
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,871
What did you say your name was?

243
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,822
Jane. Jane Porter.

244
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,341
I'll tell you what, Jane.
Can you stick around?

245
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,191
I've got a board meeting now.

246
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:00,821
Give me 30 minutes, okay?

247
00:43:01,101 --> 00:43:02,905
- Great.
- Fine.

248
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:08,709
Seventy million years ago...

249
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:13,508
this planet was struck by
an extraterrestrial object.

250
00:43:14,022 --> 00:43:16,907
But this was not just any meteor.

251
00:43:17,702 --> 00:43:19,552
This was something else.

252
00:43:19,982 --> 00:43:24,621
This was a new energy source
unlike anything we had ever seen.

253
00:43:24,622 --> 00:43:29,622
We believe that the meteor is
buried in a mantle of cooled lava.

254
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:33,305
The technological
potential is limitless.

255
00:43:34,663 --> 00:43:36,592
This was the treasure...

256
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:40,313
that John Greystoke spent his
life attempting to find.

257
00:43:40,663 --> 00:43:43,515
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, we...

258
00:43:44,064 --> 00:43:46,823
should follow in the footsteps
of John Greystoke himself

259
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,994
and blaze new paths in
energy production...

260
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:52,193
at profits...

261
00:43:53,104 --> 00:43:54,749
he could never have dreamed of.

262
00:43:55,304 --> 00:43:56,666
I'm certain...

263
00:43:57,945 --> 00:44:01,228
that if we find Greystoke,
or what's left of him...

264
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,316
we'll find that meteor.

265
00:44:03,465 --> 00:44:06,544
As you know, our competitors
are watching our every move.

266
00:44:06,545 --> 00:44:09,864
Now, we need a cover. Some way
to get close to the crash...

267
00:44:09,865 --> 00:44:12,672
without anyone knowing
why we're there.

268
00:44:13,186 --> 00:44:14,433
I know a way.

269
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:17,953
Ah, Jane. There you are.

270
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:20,425
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

271
00:44:20,426 --> 00:44:23,470
I'm so eager to find out
more about your foundation.

272
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:26,153
And how's your dad?

273
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:39,839
Hey! I want to take a
closer look at that gorge.

274
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,677
Hey! Darling!

275
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:35,562
I swear, you get more
beautiful every year!

276
00:45:36,432 --> 00:45:38,475
So good to see you again, Daddy!

277
00:45:39,832 --> 00:45:41,477
I missed you so much.

278
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:45,079
And you must be Mr. Clayton.

279
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:48,071
I can't tell you how much it
means to have your support.

280
00:45:48,072 --> 00:45:50,161
Oh, well, don't thank me.
Thank Jane.

281
00:45:50,273 --> 00:45:51,953
She wouldn't take
"no" for an answer.

282
00:45:52,873 --> 00:45:55,360
Yes, and that's my
associate, Mr. Smith.

283
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,562
He's environmentally challenged.

284
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,912
Well, I'm gonna settle in.

285
00:46:03,913 --> 00:46:06,481
Okay, darling.
Make yourself at home.

286
00:46:06,794 --> 00:46:09,838
<i>So, this is your tent.
And watch out for the ants.</i>

287
00:46:10,994 --> 00:46:13,322
<i>I forgot to tell you.
The ants bite.</i>

288
00:46:22,995 --> 00:46:26,199
What with global warming,
logging, and regional conflict...

289
00:46:26,235 --> 00:46:28,597
this eco-system has never
been more threatened.

290
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:32,636
I tell you, there's nothing more
frustrating than standing around

291
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:34,881
helplessly while the
jungle vanishes.

292
00:46:35,356 --> 00:46:39,447
What he's trying to say is
thank you. Right, Dad?

293
00:46:40,076 --> 00:46:41,277
Of course.

294
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:54,202
Goodnight, everyone.

295
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:56,481
- Goodnight, Dad.
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

296
00:48:01,802 --> 00:48:03,447
I think I better turn in as well.

297
00:48:18,803 --> 00:48:20,004
Monkeys.

298
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:30,454
What do you want, Clayton?

299
00:48:32,404 --> 00:48:33,163
Excuse me?

300
00:48:33,164 --> 00:48:35,571
Well, ever since you took
over Greystoke Energies,

301
00:48:35,644 --> 00:48:37,414
you've ignored this place.

302
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:40,723
And then, all of a sudden,
after, what, fifteen years...

303
00:48:40,724 --> 00:48:44,486
you decide to pop halfway across
the earth for an impromptu safari?

304
00:48:44,565 --> 00:48:46,005
Please!

305
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:49,215
So what do you want?

306
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:53,847
The same thing that
John Greystoke wanted.

307
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:58,607
Did you ever consider there was a
reason why Greystoke perished?

308
00:48:58,846 --> 00:49:03,370
That perhaps there are some things
that are not meant to be discovered.

309
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:07,250
Porter, you'd better
start calming down.

310
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:09,245
You've hit the
jackpot, haven't you?

311
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,486
Greystoke Energies is about to start
financing your ridiculous research...

312
00:49:12,487 --> 00:49:16,214
into the "cradle of civilization" again.
You'd better cooperate.

313
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:22,853
That's a very pretty
daughter you've got there.

314
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:26,491
We wouldn't want anything
to happen to her, would we?

315
00:49:45,689 --> 00:49:46,936
Who's there?

316
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,012
Jane.

317
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,017
You?

318
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,820
You're, you're real.

319
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:06,100
All these years, I wasn't
sure it actually happened.

320
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:08,453
<i>These mosquitoes.</i>

321
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:10,657
Wait! Don't go!

322
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:31,539
What are you doing?

323
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:36,384
- Don't sneak up on me like that.
- What is this?

324
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:39,942
Oh, really it's just...

325
00:50:40,213 --> 00:50:43,052
for detecting a highly
radioactive meteor.

326
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:44,254
A what?

327
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,935
- There you are!
- You lied to me, Clayton!

328
00:50:48,013 --> 00:50:50,102
You said you want to
support the foundation.

329
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:52,581
You said there were
no strings attached.

330
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:53,982
Oh, Jane.

331
00:50:54,614 --> 00:50:56,774
Don't you know, there are
always strings attached.

332
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,380
Isn't that right, Porter?

333
00:51:03,214 --> 00:51:04,576
Now I understand.

334
00:51:05,655 --> 00:51:07,983
God, how could I be such an idiot?

335
00:51:08,175 --> 00:51:10,537
You've been lying to me
the whole time, Dad!

336
00:51:11,255 --> 00:51:15,255
Jane, wait! That's not true! Jane!

337
00:51:16,455 --> 00:51:18,975
I hope you're happy. Relax.

338
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:20,780
We all have to grow up sometime.

339
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,538
Jane!

340
00:51:28,896 --> 00:51:29,983
Jane!

341
00:51:58,378 --> 00:51:59,340
Jane!

342
00:54:05,547 --> 00:54:07,556
Oh, no, no, no! Thank you.

343
00:54:09,187 --> 00:54:10,275
Don't! Don't.

344
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,752
- Classy.
- Classy.

345
00:54:16,948 --> 00:54:17,956
You can talk.

346
00:54:18,948 --> 00:54:19,956
Talk.

347
00:54:21,908 --> 00:54:23,394
What is your name?

348
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:26,311
Name?

349
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:28,196
Yes.

350
00:54:28,909 --> 00:54:31,510
Name. What is your name?

351
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:37,993
Jane. My name is Jane.

352
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,238
My...

353
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:44,917
name...

354
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,797
Jane.

355
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,598
No.

356
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,312
My name is Jane.

357
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,519
What is your name?

358
00:55:01,071 --> 00:55:02,432
Tarzan.

359
00:55:04,151 --> 00:55:05,273
Tarzan.

360
00:55:05,871 --> 00:55:06,958
Tarzan.

361
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:09,039
Tarzan.

362
00:55:10,712 --> 00:55:11,720
Jane.

363
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:14,877
Me Tarzan.

364
00:55:15,832 --> 00:55:18,876
- You Jane.
- Yes.

365
00:55:19,672 --> 00:55:23,320
Me Tarzan, you Jane!
Me Tarzan, you Jane!

366
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:25,397
Me Tarzan, you Jane!

367
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:28,393
- Me Tarzan, you Jane!
- Jane.

368
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:31,483
Me Tarzan, you Jane!

369
00:55:33,593 --> 00:55:34,476
Jane!

370
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:50,765
- Jane eat.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:56:57,879 --> 00:56:59,285
Whoever you are,

372
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,362
whatever riddle is buried
inside you, Tarzan,

373
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,288
I feel like I've always known you.

374
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:25,602
- Do you have a name?
- Rafiki.

375
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:29,368
Watch over Tarzan
when Tarzan sleep.

376
00:57:38,002 --> 00:57:39,010
For me?

377
00:57:41,202 --> 00:57:42,847
It's beautiful.

378
00:57:46,483 --> 00:57:48,765
My father has one just like it.

379
00:57:50,043 --> 00:57:51,688
Where did you find it?

380
00:57:58,563 --> 00:58:00,766
Smith, may I have the
coordinates, please?

381
00:58:01,524 --> 00:58:03,055
It should be right here.

382
00:58:03,244 --> 00:58:04,206
Jane?

383
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:08,968
Oh, my God! It's Jane!

384
00:58:14,405 --> 00:58:15,413
Greystoke...?

385
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:19,165
- No, that's impossible.
- What did you say?

386
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:23,846
It is Jane. Some giant ape has her.

387
00:58:24,245 --> 00:58:26,049
No, no! Don't shoot!

388
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:29,774
- You might hit Jane!
- Come on!

389
00:58:30,806 --> 00:58:32,974
No! No! Don't shoot!

390
00:58:56,688 --> 00:58:57,571
Come on!

391
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:27,689
<i>On the run from Clayton, they
entered a strange world...</i>

392
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,733
<i>never before seen by man.</i>

393
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:32,809
<i>A world which had been
under the influence...</i>

394
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,901
<i>of the meteor's mysterious
energy for millions of years.</i>

395
00:59:49,931 --> 00:59:50,893
Thanks.

396
01:00:34,774 --> 01:00:35,702
Tarzan!

397
01:01:34,219 --> 01:01:35,830
We better get outta here.

398
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:39,393
This must be what my father and
Greystoke were looking for.

399
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:43,923
Greystoke...

400
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:48,442
You remember this place.

401
01:04:51,312 --> 01:04:52,559
Of course!

402
01:04:52,832 --> 01:04:56,162
You're the boy!
You're Greystoke's son!

403
01:04:56,433 --> 01:05:00,319
But how were you able to
survive for all these years?

404
01:05:00,633 --> 01:05:02,562
My family told me.

405
01:05:02,993 --> 01:05:04,433
Your family?

406
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:09,605
Oh, hi.

407
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,891
Nice to meet you, too.

408
01:10:51,778 --> 01:10:54,026
Tarzan, I have to go
back to the camp.

409
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:57,542
Jane is angry with Tarzan?

410
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:01,303
No, Tarzan. I'm not angry.

411
01:11:02,338 --> 01:11:05,304
But my father will not
rest until he finds me.

412
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:08,788
And Clayton will kill you if he finds
out Greystoke's heir is alive.

413
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,458
As long as I'm here,
you and your family...

414
01:11:13,459 --> 01:11:15,778
and this beautiful
paradise are in danger.

415
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:17,026
Tarzan strong!

416
01:11:18,339 --> 01:11:20,030
Tarzan King of the Jungle!

417
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,986
I know, Tarzan.

418
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,668
But we can't fight Clayton's army.

419
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,751
Bring it in! This way!

420
01:12:06,263 --> 01:12:09,512
<i>Meanwhile the camp had
undergone great changes...</i>

421
01:12:09,823 --> 01:12:10,622
Keep going!

422
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:15,863
<i>As Clayton had made good on his threat
to find the meteor by any means.</i>

423
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,754
Hurry up, men!
We don't have all night!

424
01:12:37,545 --> 01:12:39,235
I love you, Tarzan.

425
01:12:40,505 --> 01:12:42,469
And I always will.

426
01:12:46,266 --> 01:12:47,627
I have to go.

427
01:13:05,267 --> 01:13:07,913
Our little runaway has
come back then, eh?

428
01:13:08,107 --> 01:13:10,628
Hello. What have we here?

429
01:13:16,348 --> 01:13:17,310
Don't!

430
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:23,038
Young Greystoke. Or do you
prefer "King of the Apes"?

431
01:13:24,588 --> 01:13:26,756
The resemblance is uncanny.

432
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:30,673
Although you have a ways to go in
the wardrobe department, don't you?

433
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:39,116
You stay out of my way, savage.

434
01:13:39,869 --> 01:13:42,311
The only savage here
is you, Clayton.

435
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:46,715
Mr. Greystoke, would you be so
kind as to bring us to the meteor?

436
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:48,797
Never.

437
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:52,439
Then unfortunately, we'll
have to go our separate ways.

438
01:14:01,391 --> 01:14:02,319
No!

439
01:14:32,313 --> 01:14:35,323
- Tarzan!
- Take her to her father.

440
01:14:35,473 --> 01:14:37,641
Tarzan!

441
01:14:39,034 --> 01:14:40,315
Jane!

442
01:14:42,234 --> 01:14:43,845
Tarzan!

443
01:16:52,683 --> 01:16:53,645
Just think...

444
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:58,482
the potential energy stored
in this one tiny piece...

445
01:16:58,483 --> 01:17:00,924
could power the entire
East coast for a month.

446
01:17:01,403 --> 01:17:03,208
Think what we could
do with a mountain.

447
01:17:05,084 --> 01:17:08,413
I'll tell you what: you
take me to the meteor...

448
01:17:09,404 --> 01:17:10,730
I'll set you both free.

449
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:12,643
Like hell I will!

450
01:17:12,644 --> 01:17:17,851
Jane, your time with the monkey man
is starting to rub off on you.

451
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:21,053
Unfortunately,
he's managed to escape.

452
01:17:21,445 --> 01:17:26,287
But Miller here and his friends are going
to follow the trail of your "ape"...

453
01:17:26,765 --> 01:17:29,366
who obviously means
so much to you, Jane.

454
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:33,773
And he's going to take care
of both him and his gang.

455
01:17:35,246 --> 01:17:36,936
I'll take you to the place.

456
01:17:38,526 --> 01:17:40,569
But you won't need
to look for Tarzan.

457
01:17:41,286 --> 01:17:42,772
He'll find you!

458
01:18:25,649 --> 01:18:27,260
Look out! Incoming!

459
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:29,653
My grandma's quicker than you guys!

460
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:42,293
<i>Hook it up and let's
get out of here!</i>

461
01:18:52,891 --> 01:18:54,934
<i>Start moving!</i>

462
01:19:16,773 --> 01:19:20,216
Detonation in ten minutes!
Clear the blast zone!

463
01:19:30,814 --> 01:19:31,856
What the...?

464
01:19:41,295 --> 01:19:43,702
<i>Detonation in eight minutes.</i>

465
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:46,225
I knew there was a meteor.

466
01:19:46,455 --> 01:19:49,943
Isn't it beautiful?
Like a gigantic diamond.

467
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:54,460
A mountain of unknown elements
from the depths of the universe!

468
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:56,704
A gift from outer space.

469
01:19:56,896 --> 01:20:01,226
Dad, seriously, we'll be blown
to pieces in a few minutes.

470
01:20:01,536 --> 01:20:03,818
We'd better find a way
to get out of here.

471
01:20:05,576 --> 01:20:07,825
Of course. You're right, my love.

472
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:09,743
<i>Hello, love.</i>

473
01:20:10,977 --> 01:20:12,827
I just want to say goodbye.

474
01:20:14,257 --> 01:20:15,583
Don't touch me!

475
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:27,900
<i>Detonation in six minutes.</i>

476
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:29,866
Timing.

477
01:20:34,258 --> 01:20:36,461
You don't know how
much I missed you!

478
01:20:38,419 --> 01:20:41,907
- This is my dad.
- J.J.? I can't believe it's you!

479
01:20:41,979 --> 01:20:44,705
- Look how big you've got!
- Boys!

480
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:47,983
When you're done here, can
we please stop Clayton?

481
01:20:50,059 --> 01:20:51,421
Dad! Come on!

482
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,067
You go and I'll stay
here and cut the cables.

483
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:57,111
- I'm not leaving without you.
- It's our only chance.

484
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,547
Don't worry.

485
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,308
<i>Detonation in four minutes.</i>

486
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:08,622
Dad, hurry!

487
01:21:08,981 --> 01:21:10,387
I'll be there in a minute!

488
01:21:18,982 --> 01:21:21,230
<i>Detonation in two minutes.</i>

489
01:21:24,142 --> 01:21:25,753
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

490
01:21:30,422 --> 01:21:31,350
Do it.

491
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:33,070
No!

492
01:21:36,783 --> 01:21:37,870
What happened?

493
01:21:40,943 --> 01:21:42,952
You again. I should have known.

494
01:21:43,503 --> 01:21:45,193
What's next, jungle boy?

495
01:22:15,385 --> 01:22:16,951
Don't monkey with me.

496
01:22:41,987 --> 01:22:43,996
Oh, my God! Dad's still down there!

497
01:23:11,789 --> 01:23:13,435
Hurry! Come on!

498
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:21,799
Go! Go!

499
01:23:30,751 --> 01:23:31,952
- Stay on them.
- Yeah.

500
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,722
- What's wrong?
- I don't know!

501
01:24:29,195 --> 01:24:30,317
Please!

502
01:24:30,755 --> 01:24:32,241
Don't let me go!

503
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:34,277
Never.

504
01:24:50,756 --> 01:24:52,117
They're getting away!

505
01:25:34,599 --> 01:25:36,529
Let's go home, Tarzan.

506
01:26:55,605 --> 01:26:58,649
Now Tarzan watch over Jane forever.

507
01:26:59,845 --> 01:27:01,410
I know, Tarzan.

508
01:27:01,765 --> 01:27:04,731
And if anyone threatens
this paradise again...

509
01:27:05,326 --> 01:27:07,255
they'll have to deal with us.

510
01:27:07,726 --> 01:27:08,848
Right, Rafiki?

511
01:27:21,807 --> 01:27:23,726
<i>And as Tarzan, Jane,
and their friends...</i>

512
01:27:23,727 --> 01:27:26,009
<i>celebrated their victory
over Clayton...</i>

513
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:28,966
<i>Tarzan found the one
thing more powerful...</i>

514
01:27:28,967 --> 01:27:31,296
<i>than all the energy
in the universe...</i>

515
01:27:31,968 --> 01:27:33,852
<i>the love of a woman.</i>

516
01:27:35,448 --> 01:27:39,175
<i>As for Porter, he's a
scientist and adventurer.</i>

517
01:27:39,648 --> 01:27:41,213
<i>But what kind of adventurer...</i>

518
01:27:41,408 --> 01:27:43,975
<i>would let a simple
old rock defeat him?</i>

518
01:27:44,305 --> 01:28:44,778
