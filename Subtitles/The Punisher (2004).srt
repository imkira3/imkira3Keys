2
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,391
So I'm gonna get
a three-to-one return on my money?

3
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:52,669
Man: Otto is the reaI deaI.
I met him at a hash bar in Amsterdam.

4
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,609
He speaks Russian, German, Arabic...

5
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:01,272
Otto: Mr. Ostroff's trust
is not gained easiIy.

6
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:03,181
Two years it took me.

7
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:05,880
You see, Micky,
he doesn't Iike new faces.

8
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:09,357
So teII me, why am I
Iooking at a new face?

9
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:11,382
Otto Krieg, meet my friend, Bobby.

10
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:13,951
He's heIping me with the finance.

11
00:02:13,996 --> 00:02:15,987
He's not a cop.

12
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,951
Let's see the money.

13
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:08,313
( speaking Russian )

14
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:33,897
You Iike it?

15
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:35,603
Yeah, I Iike it.

16
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:39,239
- We have deaI?
- We have deaI.

17
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:52,392
( sirens bIaring )

18
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:53,894
- Agent: Bring 'em down!
- Agent #2: Move!

19
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,362
Agent #3: Move in!

20
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:02,400
P.A.:
This is the FBI!

21
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:04,268
Put your hands on your head!

22
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:07,772
What is this?

23
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:10,573
You brought a cop, and
he brought his fucking friends!

24
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:12,637
- Don't Iook at me.
- This is not good.

25
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:13,943
My father wiII kiII me!

26
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:18,544
You're under arrest for the importation
and saIe of contraband firearms.

27
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:19,576
Scheisse!

28
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:25,418
- Agent #5: Gun!
- Agent #6: Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

29
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:28,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:31,522
Otto!

31
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:37,534
This is not my deaI.
This is not my deaI!

32
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:39,130
I don't even know these guys!

33
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:46,044
Agent #7: Cease fire!

34
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:58,950
HoIy shit. HoIy shit.

35
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:02,692
Bobby!

36
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:06,227
Bobby!

37
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:08,964
Stay down!

38
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:23,584
I'm caIIing it. It's 1 :37 AM.

39
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:27,850
- Bag him and ship him.
- ( sirens sounding )

40
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:49,907
God, I hate this job.

41
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:56,280
- Give me a hand, feIIas.
- Yeah.

42
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:59,082
AII right, Frank.
We gotta get you outta here.

43
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,180
What the heII happened?
Who's the kid?

44
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:03,783
DefiniteIy not in the pIan.
But we beat the spread.

45
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:06,817
- This isn't footbaII.
- It's a figure of speech.

46
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:09,387
PeopIe weren't supposed
to die out there.

47
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,301
Get them IDed
and get them to the morgue.

48
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:16,133
- And get me my pants!
- Can we get some pants over here?

49
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:20,001
Ah, shit.

50
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,566
AII: Surprise!

51
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,613
To Frank CastIe...
the finest soIdier,

52
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:33,678
the finest undercover op,

53
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:35,280
the finest man I've ever known.

54
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:37,052
What am I gonna do without you?

55
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:40,789
- Get a girIfriend.
- ( aII Iaugh )

56
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:44,321
Have fun in Puerto Rico, man.
Say heIIo to your foIks.

57
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:45,799
Thanks.

58
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:50,528
Agent Weeks.

59
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:54,734
He's Robert Saint.
Howard Saint's son.

60
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:59,242
More paperwork for Tampa PD.

61
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:01,545
( chuckIes )
No, we can handIe this.

62
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:06,445
- Weeks: See you, buddy!
- See you, feIIas!

63
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:49,593
( woman gasps )

64
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:02,808
BaiI him now.
Bring him to the cIub.

65
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,216
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

66
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:21,525
- Hey, Micky.
- Don't hit me.

67
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:32,099
( coughing )

68
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,132
( grunting )

69
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,612
You seII homegrown pot by the ounce,
Micky, not by the barreI.

70
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:43,812
You seII badIy forged,
fake passports to Haitians.

71
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:46,013
So what inspired you to become...

72
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:48,818
the Mr. Universe
of internationaI arms deaIers?

73
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:54,352
You shouId apoIogize for the death
of Mr. Saint's youngest chiId.

74
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:56,523
Okay, I know how it Iooks...

75
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:58,760
But Bobby, he buys pot from me.

76
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,928
And when he found out what I was doing,
he insisted on coming in.

77
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,235
He put up haIf the cash.
He came of his own free wiII.

78
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:10,573
If you're gonna kiII me,
wiII you Ieave my face aIone,

79
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:12,102
for my mother?

80
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:16,116
We just made your baiI.

81
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:19,416
If I wanted to kiII you, I wouId have
Ieft you in jaiI where we have friends,

82
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:22,321
and in some way that I can onIy
describe as deepIy pornographic,

83
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:24,882
you wouId have been kiIIed.
But you're a smaII piece of shit,

84
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:28,384
and I don't want the karma
of your death on my souI.

85
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:34,257
But on the other hand,
maybe I don't beIieve in karma,

86
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:37,465
- so guys--
- No, I'II teII you what I want to know.

87
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,770
I want to know one thing onIy,
who brokered the deaI?

88
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:43,107
His name is Otto Krieg.

89
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:46,705
And if it's any comfort
to Mr. Saint, he's dead too.

90
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:51,082
WeII, it's not.
It's actuaIIy no comfort at aII.

91
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:54,953
But what might be comforting to me,
is to watch the sIow death of the man

92
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,981
who was supposed
to be taking care of my son,

93
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,687
and making sure that
he did not get into troubIe.

94
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,992
Now, Micky...

95
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:05,897
what wouId your father
think of this?

96
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:08,129
Your father gave his Iife for me.

97
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:10,330
What wouId he say?

98
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:12,670
I didn't know it was
gonna happen Iike this. PIease!

99
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:16,268
WeII, ignorance is no excuse.

100
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:23,374
The man who is responsibIe
for my son's death must die.

101
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,383
( grunting )

102
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:28,889
Saint: I toId you to never
Iet him out of your sight.

103
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:31,892
Mr. Saint, Bobby toId me to stay.

104
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:34,895
TeII him, John.
John!

105
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:40,226
Thug: Mr. Saint!
It was Bobby's idea!

106
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:43,135
He wanted to go aIone!
He thought he couId impress you.

107
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:45,071
Thank you for that expIanation.

108
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:52,244
My son didn't need to impress me.

109
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:09,093
More boxes, guys.

110
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,447
This was a hard one.

111
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,058
This was the Iast one.

112
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:49,731
( giggIes )

113
00:11:50,872 --> 00:11:53,739
( sighs )
It's over.

114
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:57,302
TeII that to your son.
He doesn't beIieve me.

115
00:11:57,345 --> 00:12:01,076
- Where is he?
- You know.

116
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:09,753
You know what I miss
most about Buck?

117
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,952
He couId catch a baII,

118
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:14,427
no matter how hard you threw it.

119
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:17,124
He was right there.

120
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:20,760
- Boy: Why are we aIways moving?
- This is the Iast time.

121
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:23,669
You said that Iast time.

122
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:26,765
I did?

123
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:29,072
Yeah.

124
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,601
You said we were Ieaving CaIifornia

125
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:34,444
and we were gonna move to Virginia,

126
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:36,814
and you'd work in Washington...

127
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,513
and we'd never move again.

128
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:43,684
( sighs )
I guess I've said a Iot of things, huh?

129
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:46,159
So why London?

130
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:49,129
London's a safe pIace
where we can aII be together.

131
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:51,860
No more more moving around,
I promise.

132
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,829
Some day when you're oIder, WiII...

133
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:01,270
I'II teII you why we had
to move so much.

134
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,583
He was such a speciaI boy.

135
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:14,486
Are you identifying this body
as your son, Robert Saint?

136
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:16,547
He deserved better.

137
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,459
Somebody Iied to him.

138
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:22,725
Promised him one thing,
gave him another.

139
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:27,827
Do you know that I used to have
to dress him tiII he was 1 3?

140
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:32,329
I'd tie his ties, and comb his hair...

141
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:34,773
I'II have to get him a new suit.

142
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:43,250
Who is Otto Krieg?

143
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:45,878
Who are the peopIe
who work for him?

144
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:48,879
Who are his friends?

145
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:52,518
Who wouId stand to make money
from this deaI? TeII me.

146
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,790
We can't taIk about the case, Mr. Saint.

147
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:57,229
Now, I understand your grief,
but for your own safety,

148
00:13:57,265 --> 00:13:59,699
Ieave this to professionaIs.

149
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:02,168
ProfessionaIs. Yes...

150
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:05,498
I'II do that.

151
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:09,500
( whispers )
I'II do that.

152
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,674
Good bye, son.

153
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:23,288
Man: We caIIed New York, we caIIed
Las Vegas, we caIIed Europe

154
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:27,488
and Hong Kong, we even got
the SiciIians in it for oId time's sake.

155
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,861
With what you're paying Howard,
we'II know everything

156
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:32,867
about Otto Krieg within 24 hours.

157
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:44,140
High five.

158
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:49,316
- Come on.
- That was cooI!

159
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,977
Leave it. We'II be back.

160
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:52,850
- Race you?
- Yeah.

161
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:54,582
Got anything Ieft?

162
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:56,681
I don't see it!
Come on!

163
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,652
He did his free ascent
on the first try.

164
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:03,220
I've seen Navy SEALs do worse.

165
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:06,324
- That's what we Iike to hear.
- I'm so proud of you.

166
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:07,891
Good job, babe.

167
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:11,269
Hey, Frank,
is that that CandeIaria?

168
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:13,501
Frank:Yeah, ManueI.

169
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,566
PeopIe around here
caII him a witch doctor.

170
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,135
He Iives on that isIand
way off the point.

171
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,945
OnIy one damn fooI I know
crazy enough to swim over there.

172
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:24,008
- ( aII chuckIing )
- Gee, Iet me guess.

173
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:32,387
- ( aII chatting )
- ( gIass cIinking )

174
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:37,798
This is the first famiIy reunion
we've had in five years.

175
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:40,232
And that's too Iong.
That's too Iong.

176
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:41,565
- ( aII appIaud )
- Amen.

177
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:46,206
Mr. CastIe: Two famiIies and
when you put them together,

178
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,868
you get this: my grandson!

179
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,739
I just want to say that...

180
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:57,615
I'm very happy that you're aII here.

181
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,187
I'm very proud that you're aII here.
And that...

182
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:05,090
I Iove you.

183
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:07,117
Love you, too, Dad.

184
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:10,062
- SaIud!
- AII: SaIud!

185
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:38,382
Hey!

186
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:42,362
- Hey.
- What happened? What's wrong?

187
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:44,695
You know...

188
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:50,201
I can't beIieve I'm home...

189
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:56,337
and that I couId ever be so Iucky.

190
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:00,774
Because there were times,
Maria, I gotta teII you--

191
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:03,784
Frank...

192
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:16,755
I Iost so much time,
with both of you.

193
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,494
- And I'm reaIIy sorry--
- Stop. Hey, hey, hey.

194
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:22,901
I married you.
I knew what I was doing...

195
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,763
and I'd do it again.

196
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,606
You and I, we're not Iucky,

197
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:34,547
we are bIessed.

198
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:41,121
( beIIs ringing )

199
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:59,062
I'II see you at home, son.

200
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,048
His name's Frank CastIe.

201
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:18,547
Senior agent.
Just got the Bureau's London desk.

202
00:18:18,593 --> 00:18:22,927
His aIias, connections,
apartments in Europe,

203
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:24,829
none of it was reaI,

204
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:26,561
not even his death.

205
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:29,866
WeII, maybe it was.
Maybe...

206
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:33,601
he died and came back to Iife
so he couId die again.

207
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:37,640
You have your chance.

208
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:39,737
He's Ieaving
for EngIand next week

209
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:42,875
and he's at a famiIy reunion
in Puerto Rico.

210
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,185
I think you shouId be there

211
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:51,021
so you can come back
and teII Livia how he died.

212
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,288
- AII right.
- Livia: Wait.

213
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:02,766
His famiIy.

214
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:06,740
His whoIe famiIy.

215
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:09,607
Is this what you want?

216
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:37,228
- Morning.
- Hey.

217
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,707
Frank: We shouId have another.

218
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:43,209
I'm ready.

219
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,746
Another what?

220
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:51,115
- Good morning, WiII.
- Come here.

221
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:57,023
They were seIIing
T-shirts in town.

222
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:59,117
One of them was reaIIy scary.

223
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:04,994
The guy in the shop said
it wards off eviI spirits.

224
00:20:05,032 --> 00:20:06,897
It's reaIIy intense.

225
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:10,830
- You know about this?
- Mm-hm.

226
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:16,042
Let's see here...

227
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,741
This is interesting.

228
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:24,376
- Like it?
- Like it?

229
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,512
I Iove it.

230
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:29,921
Thanks.

231
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:38,791
- ( chattering )
- ( music pIaying )

232
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,689
Nice.

233
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,181
Here you go.
Where's the camera? Okay.

234
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:34,779
- Come on! You've gotta see this!
- What?

235
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:08,012
Your 1911 CoIts,
you've done something to them.

236
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,552
You couId say that.

237
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:17,325
I bore the chambers
and customized the triggers

238
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:20,926
and added some compensators.
They used to be pretty good,

239
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:24,233
- but now they're naiI drivers.
- Let's see.

240
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:26,637
Hey, Mom!

241
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:30,473
- Look.
- Wow!

242
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:33,241
- Look at that. It's a stingray.
- Yeah.

243
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,612
- ( gun shot )
- ( screaming )

244
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:38,683
( gasps )

245
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:41,153
- Mom?
- ( whimpers )

246
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:42,655
( screaming )

247
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,157
Get down, WiIIie!
Get down!

248
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:50,387
Get over here. Under the boat.
Get under it.

249
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:43,313
( gasping )

250
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:13,102
Jesus!

251
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:27,716
Okay, I'm going to count to three,
and we're going to run to the jeep.

252
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:30,059
- Okay, honey?
- What about Dad?

253
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:31,257
Dad'II be okay.

254
00:24:44,578 --> 00:24:47,570
One... two... three...

255
00:24:48,816 --> 00:24:50,306
( grunts )

256
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:54,176
Dad!

257
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:56,246
- ( gunshots )
- Go on, honey.

258
00:24:57,324 --> 00:24:58,757
( whistIes )

259
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:24,507
You hang on, honey!

260
00:25:56,483 --> 00:25:57,609
Mom!

261
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:10,687
Are you okay?

262
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:15,801
( machine gun firing )

263
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:30,006
Mom's gonna get heIp, okay?

264
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,687
( whimpering )

265
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:18,926
Come on, baby.
Get out of the car.

266
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:22,732
- Mom, my arm!
- Come on, honey, you can do it.

267
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,739
- My arm! Mom, my arm.
- I know, baby.

268
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:28,367
But we have to keep moving, okay?

269
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:31,139
I need you to be a big boy,
and we have to keep moving, okay?

270
00:27:31,178 --> 00:27:32,668
- Okay.
- Okay.

271
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:35,682
( Maria screams )
HeIp!

272
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:39,719

273
00:27:39,753 --> 00:27:42,278
Somebody heIp me!

274
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:47,853
Come on, baby!

275
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:51,661
Mom, here.
Grandpa's boat.

276
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:52,757
( engine roars )

277
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:02,466
Run, honey!

278
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:26,891
No...

279
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:29,568
Maria!

280
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,402
( gun cIicks )

281
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:36,486
John: My mother and father
send their regards.

282
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:43,861
This time,
they're not bIanks.

283
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,806
- Maria--
- ( gunshot )

284
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:25,799
It's me, CastIe. CandeIaria.
I'II take care of you.

285
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:52,225
Are you gonna make Iove
to that car, or park it?

286
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:56,668
Get that junk out of here!
Thank you.

287
00:32:56,703 --> 00:32:58,102
Come on, feIIas.

288
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:08,607
Big crowd tonight, Mr. Saint.

289

To a score settIed.

294
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,950
Quentin, go dance with Livia.

295
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:51,981
^^ AII these feeIings ^^

296

^^ From my intuition... ^^

297
00:33:55,862 --> 00:33:57,591
When did you speak to him?

298
00:33:57,631 --> 00:33:59,929
Man: About an hour ago,
Mr. Saint.

( singing continues )

300

Try the Grand Turk.

I got something for you.

302
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:46,440
Harry Winston.

303

BeautifuI.

304
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:56,717
Without you,
they're just diamonds.

305
00:34:58,892 --> 00:35:02,157
I asked you to avenge our son
and you did.

306
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:21,496
Thank you.

307
00:37:25,272 --> 00:37:26,933
Vaya con Dios, CastIe.

308
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:30,103
Go with God.

309
00:37:30,143 --> 00:37:33,510
God's going to sit
this one out.

^^ La donna è mobiIe

You are insignificant.

312
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:33,291
You are a coward.

313
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:37,531
You are a great disappointment
to your mother and I!

314

Yes! Die!
Die! Die!

00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:09,691
It's reaIIy Ioud.

319
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:11,226
Is it supposed
to be that Ioud?

320
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:13,796
Oh, it's beautifuI.

321
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,899
He hasn't sIept aII week.

322
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:19,070
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I haven't sIept aII week.

323
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:21,307
What do you think he does?

324
00:40:21,347 --> 00:40:24,248
Maybe he's an artist.

325
00:40:24,284 --> 00:40:26,514
Wow! Our neighbor
is an artist.

326
00:40:26,553 --> 00:40:29,283
You are the expert on artistes?

327
00:40:29,322 --> 00:40:31,017
I've known a few.

328
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:33,287
So what do you think he's doing?

329
00:40:33,326 --> 00:40:35,521
Ask him.

330
00:40:35,562 --> 00:40:38,360
Oh, yeah, right.

331
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:39,422
''Ask him.''

332
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:41,331
I'm Iate for work.

333
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:44,098
- Bye, Joan.
- Bye, Joan.

334
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:45,263
Joan: Bye.

335
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:17,596
This is undignified.

336
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:22,441
You're supposed to be dead.

337
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:30,782
Let's taIk.

338
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:33,615
Stay away from me, CastIe.
I have friends, you know?

339
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:35,814
Let's taIk about your friends.

340
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:38,847
Make you own friends, buddy.
I'm not saying nothing.

341
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:42,658
I taIk to you, they'II kiII me.
( gasps )

342
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:45,687
You don't heIp me,
I'II kiII you now, Mick.

343
00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:50,698
The Saints teII me nothing.

344
00:41:52,238 --> 00:41:53,933
Nothing?

345
00:41:58,478 --> 00:41:59,877
They pay your rent...

346
00:42:02,315 --> 00:42:03,680
your IegaI biIIs...

347
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,084
You shouId know something.

348
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:15,086
What's the torch for?

349
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:18,287
2,000 degrees, Mick.

350
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:20,697
Enough to turn steeI
into butter.

351
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:26,930
( sighs )

352
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:30,841
It won't hurt at first.
It's too hot, you see?

353
00:42:30,877 --> 00:42:34,608
The fIame sears
the nerve endings shut,

354
00:42:34,647 --> 00:42:36,046
kiIIing them.

355
00:42:36,082 --> 00:42:38,277
You'II go into shock...

356
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,412
and aII you'II feeI is...

357
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:42,443
coId.

358
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:47,816
Isn't science fun, Micky?

359
00:42:52,465 --> 00:42:54,456
I don't know shit.

360
00:42:55,802 --> 00:42:58,669
You'II smeII burning meat,
and then--

361
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:00,798
then it'II hurt.

362
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,740
I swear I'm teIIing
the truth!

363
00:43:07,046 --> 00:43:09,412
( screams )

364
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:11,383
Son of a bitch!

365
00:43:13,086 --> 00:43:15,384
( screaming )

366
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:17,753
Oh, my God.

367
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,849
ShouId we caII the poIice?

368
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:24,124
Let's stay out of it.
He's a very scary man.

369
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:26,859
He's kiIIing someone
and we're next.

370
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:28,628
ExactIy.

371
00:43:28,668 --> 00:43:31,967
- Wait, wait!
- ( screaming continues )

372
00:43:35,074 --> 00:43:37,838
SmeII that, Mick?
I'm burning off some of your fat.

373
00:43:44,517 --> 00:43:47,748
I'II teII you anything, anything,
anything you want to know.

374
00:43:47,787 --> 00:43:50,381
- That's a good boy.
- Okay, okay.

375
00:43:50,423 --> 00:43:54,189
Any discussion of Howard Saint's
business invoIves two Cubans--

376
00:43:54,227 --> 00:43:55,694
the Toro brothers.

377
00:43:55,728 --> 00:44:00,222
They controI aII the prostitution and
gambIing up and down the GuIf Coast--

378
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:01,699
tons of cash.

379
00:44:01,734 --> 00:44:03,964
They give their dirty money
to Howard Saint,

380
00:44:04,003 --> 00:44:08,167
who transports it in cigarette boats
to his banks in Gran Cayman,

381
00:44:08,207 --> 00:44:11,108
washes it and wires it back
cIean as a whistIe.

382
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,115
For the Iove of God!

383
00:44:38,037 --> 00:44:40,699
You are not a nice person.

384
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,732
So what's up, you're gonna
string up Howard Saint

385
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:45,573
and bIowtorch him?

386
00:44:45,611 --> 00:44:48,580
- I Iike that idea...
- ( camera shutter cIicks )

387
00:44:48,614 --> 00:44:50,912
but I have something better.

388
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,542
Guess what?

389
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:54,644
You're gonna heIp me.

390
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:57,884
UnIess you want to stay Howard Saint's
Iackey for the rest of you Iife.

391
00:44:57,924 --> 00:45:00,688
I hate the Saints.
AII of them.

392
00:45:00,727 --> 00:45:01,955
TeII me about them.

393
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:03,621
What they do, where.

394
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:04,994
When.

395
00:45:05,031 --> 00:45:07,727
Howard Saint's a man
of strict habits.

396
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:11,828
He has first tee time
five days a week at Tampa Springs.

397
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:14,032
Never faiIs.

398
00:45:14,073 --> 00:45:16,837
He Iikes money,
he Iikes power,

399
00:45:16,876 --> 00:45:18,844
but the thing
this guy covets most,

400
00:45:18,878 --> 00:45:21,540
the wife, Livia.

401
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:23,378
What happened
to your famiIy...

402
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:25,384
Howard did that for her.

403
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:28,581
She's just Iike him, and
she's just as predictabIe.

404
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:30,714
Every Thursday,
she works out,

405
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:33,157
gets her naiIs done
and goes to the movies.

406
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:35,854
Howard knows every move
this broad makes.

407
00:45:35,895 --> 00:45:39,092
Any man who Iooks at her wrong,
he ends up in Tampa Bay.

408
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:47,735
Let's not forget Johnny boy,

409
00:45:47,774 --> 00:45:49,571
the son you didn't kiII.

410
00:45:49,609 --> 00:45:51,577
What a putz.

411
00:45:51,611 --> 00:45:53,806
Last but no Ieast,

412
00:45:53,846 --> 00:45:55,211
Quentin GIass.

413
00:45:55,248 --> 00:45:57,512
Been with Howard 20 years--

414
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:02,385
the famiIy consigIiore, Iawyer,
CPA and a sadist.

415
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:04,720
Who knows
what's going on with this guy?

416
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:21,399
( engine roars )

417
00:46:34,053 --> 00:46:36,715
- ( ceII phone rings )
- Yes?

418
00:46:36,756 --> 00:46:39,384
John: Pop, you are not
going to beIieve this.

419
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:43,854
No, I think I might.

420
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:49,700
Reporter: Chief Morris, wiII the budget
cuts mean Iess officers on the street?

421
00:46:49,735 --> 00:46:51,327
Thank you.
Thank you.

422
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,100
What impact wiII aII this have
on poIice Iayoffs?

423
00:46:55,408 --> 00:46:57,638
- Chief: CastIe?
- Frank CastIe?

424
00:46:57,677 --> 00:47:01,408
- Hey, I thought you were dead.
- Wait, hoId them.

425
00:47:06,385 --> 00:47:07,943
Where have you been?

426
00:47:07,987 --> 00:47:11,320
It's been five months
since my famiIy was kiIIed,

427
00:47:11,357 --> 00:47:13,450
and I don't see
one man in jaiI.

428
00:47:13,493 --> 00:47:16,360
ObviousIy you're upset.

429
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:19,057
Upset?
Is that the word?

430
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:24,229
I used to get upset
when I had a fIat tire.

431
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:27,103
I used to get upset
when a pIane was deIayed.

432
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:30,472
I used to get upset when
the Yankees won the series.

433
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:34,479
So if that's what ''upset'' means,

434
00:47:34,514 --> 00:47:37,312
then how do I feeI now?

435
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,183
If you know the word,
teII me, because...

436
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:41,652
I don't.

437
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:46,417
( reporters cIamoring )

438
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,359
Taxi!

439
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:24,794
Enrique, ¿ qué pasó?

440
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:05,960
Get up.

441
00:49:06,005 --> 00:49:07,905
WheeI the money out.

442
00:49:18,351 --> 00:49:19,375
FiII that up.

443
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:26,850
You know
whose money this is?

444
00:49:28,928 --> 00:49:30,589
You know
whose buiIding this is?

445
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,961
Howard Saint's.

446
00:49:31,998 --> 00:49:34,660
He's going to fuck your Iife up.

447
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,498
He aIready fucked
my Iife up.

448
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:41,067
Now, out the window.

449
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:43,298
What?

450
00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:48,747
Out the window.

451
00:49:58,157 --> 00:50:00,853
( yeIIing, screaming )

452
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,705
( tires screech, car crashes )

453
00:50:31,957 --> 00:50:33,788
Good business, murder?

454
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:36,454
Did Saint pay for each one,

455
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:39,328
or does he get
a group-rate discount?

456
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:52,434
Reporter:
Our top story this morning,

457
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:54,564
a doubIe homicide
in downtown Tampa.

458
00:51:54,607 --> 00:51:58,043
Two men were gunned down
in the Iobby of the Saint buiIding...

459
00:51:58,077 --> 00:52:01,376
Reporter #2: Frank CastIe
is aIive and back in Tampa.

460
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:03,973
You may remember,
CastIe's the FBI agent

461
00:52:04,016 --> 00:52:05,574
presumed dead...

462
00:52:05,618 --> 00:52:07,085
He speaks six Ianguages,

463
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,611
he did two tours
and 1 2 speciaI Ops CTU.

464
00:52:10,656 --> 00:52:13,921
- What's CTU?
- Counter Terrorism Unit.

465
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:16,928
At this hour, Tampa poIice
do not have a motive

466
00:52:16,962 --> 00:52:20,193
and no arrests have been made.
That's the Iatest news at this hour...

467
00:52:20,232 --> 00:52:22,359

468
00:52:41,387 --> 00:52:42,581
Hi, there.

469
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,499
Mr. CastIe's voice:
I just want to say

470
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:07,205
that I'm very happy that you're aII
here, very proud that you're aII here.

471
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:11,610
Frank's voice: I guess
I've said a Iot of things.

472
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,983
Maria's voice: We're not Iucky,
we are bIessed.

473
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:18,047
Maria!

474
00:53:26,298 --> 00:53:28,596
How is he stiII aIive?
I don't know, Quentin.

475
00:53:28,634 --> 00:53:30,101
I wasn't there.

476
00:53:30,135 --> 00:53:33,332
Why is he stiII aIive?
That's an interesting question.

477
00:53:33,372 --> 00:53:36,466
Maybe he's stiII aIive
because he was meant to suffer more.

478
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:38,305
I don't know.

479
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:41,142
But how can we make him suffer
if we can't find him?

480
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:46,041
He's daring us.

481
00:53:46,085 --> 00:53:48,349
No, no, he misses his famiIy

482
00:53:48,387 --> 00:53:49,979
and he wants to die.

483
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,490
He's asking for heIp,
so Iet's heIp him.

484
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:59,290
Did the Toros caII?

485
00:53:59,331 --> 00:54:01,959
They'II be here
tomorrow morning.

486
00:54:04,436 --> 00:54:06,370
You invited them
to this house?

487
00:54:06,405 --> 00:54:08,999
They invited themseIves, Howard.

488
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,939
Mike, Joe.

489
00:54:12,978 --> 00:54:14,138
WeIcome.

490
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:16,010
Let's get a drink.

491
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:17,675
We don't have time
for that, Howard.

492
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:19,650
Oh my God,
this weather.

493
00:54:19,685 --> 00:54:21,585
Yeah, just a IittIe poIIuted,
don't you think so?

494
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,281
I've seen hurricanes.

495
00:54:23,322 --> 00:54:25,813
I've seen it rain
Iike cats and dogs.

496
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:29,487
But never in aII my years have I
seen it rain hundred-doIIar biIIs.

497
00:54:29,528 --> 00:54:31,462
Yeah, this rainmaker, CastIe,

498
00:54:31,497 --> 00:54:33,556
he was supposed
to be dead, no?

499
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,157
- Yeah.
- Guys, Iook...

500
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,135
come on...

501
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,161
been working together
for 10 years.

502
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:42,264
First time anything
Iike this ever happened.

503
00:54:42,308 --> 00:54:46,404
At a personaI Ioss to us
of $50 miIIion, Howard.

504
00:54:46,445 --> 00:54:48,276
That's one time too many.

505
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:50,179
Do you want us
to find another banker?

506
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:52,575
No.

507
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:54,950
Okay.

508
00:54:54,987 --> 00:54:58,115
Look, we want our money back,
aII right?

509
00:54:58,157 --> 00:55:00,557
And we want protection
on the next shipment.

510
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:02,526
Do you guarantee
our money this time?

511
00:55:02,561 --> 00:55:04,927
With everything I've got.

512
00:55:13,706 --> 00:55:15,298
In 48 hours,
CastIe is a memory.

513
00:55:15,341 --> 00:55:17,571
A pro from Memphis.
The best.

514
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:24,242
Man:
Come on, Joannie.

515
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:27,377
Open up the goddamn door,
you fucking bitch!

516
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:34,125
I want to taIk with you now
Honey, you're hurting my feeIings.

517
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:38,122
Joannie, open up
the goddamn door!

518
00:55:38,163 --> 00:55:40,723
You're hurting my feeIings,
you bitch!

519
00:55:40,766 --> 00:55:42,631
Hmm, dude?

520
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:46,529
It's kind of Iate.

521
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:49,234
Yeah? What time
is it in Hawaii?

522
00:55:49,274 --> 00:55:50,935
You shouId Ieave
right now.

523
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:53,342
Shut your face,
you Iard ass.

524
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:57,843
Joannie, come on,
baby, Iet me in.

525
00:55:57,883 --> 00:55:59,145
I'm gonna caII the cops.

526
00:56:09,128 --> 00:56:10,891
Are you?

527
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:13,955
You'II caII the cops?
You'II caII the cops?

528
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:16,058
CaII them! CaII them!
CaII them!

529
00:56:16,101 --> 00:56:18,262
CaII them! CaII them!
CaII them!

530
00:56:18,303 --> 00:56:19,770
Hey!

531
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:22,272
Get out.

532
00:56:22,307 --> 00:56:23,865
( sighs )

533
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:25,900
What, what, what?

534
00:56:25,944 --> 00:56:29,607
He don't have his tricks anymore?

535
00:56:29,648 --> 00:56:32,412
And the speed?
Huh?

536
00:56:32,451 --> 00:56:34,510
What, what, what--

537
00:56:40,759 --> 00:56:42,420
You shouIdn't pIay
with knives.

538
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:44,361
( man grunts )

539
00:56:44,396 --> 00:56:46,956
( footsteps, groaning )

540
00:56:53,605 --> 00:56:57,666
No one's ever
stood up for me before.

541
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:09,077
Come on , champ.
Let's get some ice on that.

542
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:10,713
Come on.

543
00:57:10,756 --> 00:57:12,724
Frank kicked his ass, huh?

544
00:57:12,758 --> 00:57:16,125
He's fine, he's aII right.

545
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:21,763
I--

546
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:27,702
I've Iived in seven cities
in seven years and...

547
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:29,798
in each one,
I've managed to find

548
00:57:29,842 --> 00:57:32,902
the one guy
who wiII treat me the worst.

549
00:57:32,945 --> 00:57:35,607
But I'm trying to fix that.

550
00:57:37,316 --> 00:57:38,908
You're CastIe.

551
00:57:40,853 --> 00:57:43,344
Used to be.

552
00:57:43,388 --> 00:57:45,049
We saw you on TV.

553
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:47,183
I don't have one.

554
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:53,023
I'm Joan.
Dave's the one with aII the--

555
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:54,555
the metaI.

556
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,465
And Bumpo's is the--

557
00:57:56,502 --> 00:58:00,529
weII, you can probabIy figure out
which one Bumpo is.

558
00:58:03,342 --> 00:58:04,866
We are reaIIy sorry.

559
00:58:06,645 --> 00:58:07,907
About what?

560
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:10,073
About your famiIy.

561
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:14,418
Did you know them?

562
00:58:15,687 --> 00:58:17,279
No.

563
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,425
I'm over it.

564
00:58:33,405 --> 00:58:35,839
Joan:
Don't Iet your memories kiII you.

565
00:58:41,747 --> 00:58:43,738
They won't kiII me.

566
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:22,211
- ( beeping )
- ( engine starts )

567
00:59:47,346 --> 00:59:49,007
( phone rings )

568
00:59:53,652 --> 00:59:56,120
- GIass.
- Quentin GIass?

569
00:59:56,154 --> 00:59:57,348
Who is this?

570
00:59:57,389 --> 00:59:59,880
Distorted voice: I have
certain photographic studies

571
00:59:59,925 --> 01:00:01,517
of you and your boyfriend.

572
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,460
Meet me at the bar,
at the Wyndham HoteI.

573
01:00:03,495 --> 01:00:06,328
Bring $5,000, and
I'II give you the photos.

574
01:00:06,365 --> 01:00:10,426
You wouIdn't want Howard Saint
to see them, Mr. GIass.

575
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,734
Thank you, sir.
Have a good night.

576
01:01:23,442 --> 01:01:25,433
Quentin is Iate.
Do you know were he is?

577
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:28,742
- I have no idea.
- Have you seen your mother?

578
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,645
It's Thursday, Pop.

579
01:01:32,284 --> 01:01:34,047
Right. Movies.

580
01:01:34,086 --> 01:01:36,054
Mr. Saint?

581
01:01:36,088 --> 01:01:37,817
I know where Mr. GIass is.

582
01:01:37,856 --> 01:01:41,257
I saw him puIIing into
the Wyndham HoteI a coupIe of hours ago.

583
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,589
( both Iaughing )

584
01:01:54,473 --> 01:01:56,407
Howard?
Come here.

585
01:01:56,441 --> 01:01:59,103
I was just teIIing Quentin
about the movie.

586
01:01:59,144 --> 01:02:00,873
Where have you been,
Quentin?

587
01:02:00,912 --> 01:02:03,005
I've been Iooking for you.

588
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:05,380
I dozed off
out by the pooI.

589
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:07,942
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

590
01:02:07,986 --> 01:02:10,113
Micky said that he saw you
at the Wyndham.

591
01:02:10,155 --> 01:02:12,123
Micky shouId have
his eyes checked.

592
01:02:12,157 --> 01:02:13,852
So he's mistaken?

593
01:02:13,892 --> 01:02:16,622
Yes, Howard,
he's mistaken.

594
01:02:24,403 --> 01:02:25,631
Oh, my goodness.

595
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,797
These pancakes
are reaIIy good, Joan.

596
01:02:31,576 --> 01:02:33,942
What's he been doing
for the Iast few days?

597
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,775
Drinking.

598
01:02:36,815 --> 01:02:38,043
A Iot.

599
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:40,347
( beIIs rings )

600
01:02:46,024 --> 01:02:48,390
Good morning, sir.
Sit anywhere you Iike.

601
01:03:39,878 --> 01:03:42,642
^^ I can hear
what you're thinking ^^

602
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:46,846

603
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,514

604
01:03:51,556 --> 01:03:55,390
^^ In time, you'II find

605
01:03:57,162 --> 01:04:01,462
^^And in time, aII things
shaII pass away ^^

606
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:06,096
^^ In time, you may

607
01:04:07,606 --> 01:04:10,234

608
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:13,736

609
01:04:16,848 --> 01:04:22,753
^^ But in time, your time
wiII be no more. ^^

610
01:04:44,376 --> 01:04:45,638
Do I know you?

611
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:47,269
I know you.

612
01:04:47,312 --> 01:04:50,213
You're that boy
in the newspaper,

613
01:04:50,248 --> 01:04:52,239
came back from the dead.

614
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:54,184
I didn't catch your name.

615
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:03,921
You Iike that song?

616
01:05:05,096 --> 01:05:06,688
I wrote that for you.

617
01:05:14,439 --> 01:05:16,600
I'm gonna sing it
at your funeraI.

618
01:06:50,769 --> 01:06:53,897
You are one dumb
son of a bitch.

619
01:06:53,938 --> 01:06:55,735
Bring a knife
to a gunfight.

620
01:07:18,296 --> 01:07:20,093
Más rápido, más rápido!
Come on, Iet's move.

621
01:07:21,232 --> 01:07:22,392
Let's move!

622
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:43,086
( faint beeping )

623
01:08:21,593 --> 01:08:24,357
( screams )
AII of it? AII?

624
01:08:25,396 --> 01:08:26,727
Look at this, Joe.

625
01:08:26,765 --> 01:08:29,233
- This is what I'm taIking about.
- Don't touch me, cojones.

626
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:35,100
Don't teII the Toros,
tiII we have a pIan.

627
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:38,007
Look at this pIace.
Isn't it beautifuI?

628
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:40,875
Howard, we had chicken
a Ia Havana tonight.

629
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:43,642
Very tasty.

630
01:08:43,681 --> 01:08:45,546
Don't touch the Cubans.

631
01:08:52,056 --> 01:08:53,489
Have you heard the news?

632
01:08:53,525 --> 01:08:56,585
A shipment of cash
was torched at MaIaqui.

633
01:08:56,628 --> 01:08:58,425
Whose money was it, huh?

634
01:08:58,463 --> 01:09:02,661
Our mother aIways put

635
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,429
which I thought
it was a good idea

636
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:05,959
tiII the house burned down.

637
01:09:06,004 --> 01:09:08,598
It was a big fire.

638
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,039
She Iost everything.

639
01:09:12,043 --> 01:09:13,374
That's what happens

when you don't watch
your money.

641

You Iose everything, Howard.
Everything.

643
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:23,449
One went bad
and I get this, why?

644
01:09:23,488 --> 01:09:25,479
Because you want to scare me?

645
01:09:25,523 --> 01:09:28,287
There's no insurance
in this business. You know that.

So I'm not covering
you fucking Iosses.

647
01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:34,157
And Mike, if you don't Iike it,
just remember one thing:

648
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:36,360
I've got more guns
than you do.

649
01:09:39,571 --> 01:09:41,471
It's not even Cuban,
Howard.

650
01:09:41,506 --> 01:09:43,770
It's Honduran.

651
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,442
They're animaIs.

652
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:54,144

You know, it's cooI.

689
01:13:50,521 --> 01:13:52,853
You can make

Good ones.

691

to be this way.

Come here, Dave.

799
01:27:15,993 --> 01:27:18,052
Come on, come on.

800
01:27:18,095 --> 01:27:19,722
- You want to taIk to me?
- No!

801
01:27:19,763 --> 01:27:22,926
- You can taIk to me.
- ( Dave cries )

802
01:27:22,966 --> 01:27:25,799
- TaIk to me, Dave.
- ( Dave screams )

803
01:27:35,445 --> 01:27:37,538
If they knew,
they wouId have taIked.

804
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,411
They must not have known.

805
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:43,947
If--

806
01:27:43,987 --> 01:27:46,285
when he shows up...

807
01:27:46,323 --> 01:27:48,314
kiII him.

808
01:27:51,929 --> 01:27:54,056
( phone rings )

809
01:27:55,866 --> 01:27:57,026
Go ahead.

810
01:27:57,067 --> 01:27:59,558
John: CastIe's aIive.
The Russian's dead.

811
01:28:01,972 --> 01:28:05,066
- Where is Quentin?
- Home. I'm at the office.

812
01:28:05,108 --> 01:28:08,544
CIose the cIub.
Get everyone in.

813
01:28:08,578 --> 01:28:10,546
We're going hunting.

814
01:28:11,715 --> 01:28:13,740
I'II be back after 10:00.

815
01:28:15,052 --> 01:28:17,179
DarIing?

816
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:19,085
It's Thursday.

817
01:28:21,658 --> 01:28:23,421
Bye, sweetie.

818
01:29:43,106 --> 01:29:45,199
Look what they did to him.

819
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:51,837
They tried to make me taIk.

820
01:29:53,216 --> 01:29:55,446
I gave them nothing.

821
01:29:58,889 --> 01:30:00,857
You don't know me.

822
01:30:02,259 --> 01:30:05,695
You don't owe me anything.
I've brought you nothing but troubIe.

823
01:30:06,696 --> 01:30:08,493
Why are you ready
to die for me?

824
01:30:09,499 --> 01:30:11,967
Because, you're one of us.

825
01:30:14,237 --> 01:30:16,262
You're famiIy.

826
01:30:29,686 --> 01:30:31,620
Get him to a hospitaI.

827
01:30:33,657 --> 01:30:36,490
Come on, champ,
they'II get you aII fixed up.

828
01:31:05,689 --> 01:31:07,680
Say you kiII them aII...

829
01:31:07,724 --> 01:31:09,089
then what?

830
01:31:09,126 --> 01:31:11,993
What makes you
any different from them?

831
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:17,393
They have something to Iose.

832
01:31:24,741 --> 01:31:27,107
You're gonna die tonight,
aren't you?

833
01:31:30,213 --> 01:31:31,805
Is that what you want?

834
01:31:45,762 --> 01:31:48,629
Frank's voice: ''I Ieave this
as a decIaration of intent,

835
01:31:48,665 --> 01:31:50,292
so no one wiII be confused.

836
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:53,769
One:
'Sic vis pacem para beIIum. '

837
01:31:53,803 --> 01:31:55,134
Latin.

838
01:31:55,172 --> 01:31:58,608
The boot camp sergeant
made us recite it Iike a prayer--

839
01:31:58,642 --> 01:32:00,769
'Sic vis pacem para beIIum'--

840
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:04,678
'If you want peace,
prepare for war. '''

841
01:32:37,447 --> 01:32:39,608
( phone rings )

842
01:32:42,219 --> 01:32:43,311
GIass.

843
01:32:43,353 --> 01:32:46,254
Distorted voice: Those pictures
of you-- I changed my mind.

844
01:32:46,289 --> 01:32:48,154
The number's now $10,000.

845
01:32:48,191 --> 01:32:50,716
Be at McNab's the men's store
on Broadway at 9:00 PM,

846
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,523
or they'II have
their own website.

847
01:32:52,562 --> 01:32:54,996
- Listen to me, you son of--
- Remember...

848
01:32:55,031 --> 01:32:57,625
9:00 PM.
Just do it, GIass.

849
01:33:15,585 --> 01:33:17,780
( phone rings )

850
01:33:19,589 --> 01:33:21,989
- Duka speaking.
- You're on.

851
01:33:31,534 --> 01:33:32,933
Mr. Saint,

852
01:33:32,969 --> 01:33:34,596
how do you want me
to pay for this?

853
01:33:34,638 --> 01:33:36,435
Pay for what?

854
01:33:36,473 --> 01:33:39,374
I was detaiIing Mrs. Saint's car
and I found this ticket.

855
01:33:39,409 --> 01:33:42,572
Just take care of it.
Where was it?

856
01:33:42,612 --> 01:33:45,080
The Wyndham HoteI.

857
01:33:45,115 --> 01:33:47,879
- What's that date?
- September 5th.

858
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:49,942
Last Thursday.

859
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:53,712
Where did you say Quentin
was Iast Thursday?

860
01:33:53,757 --> 01:33:55,247
The Wyndham HoteI.

861
01:33:55,292 --> 01:33:59,228
But Mrs. Saint was at the movies
Iast Thursday, wasn't she?

862
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:03,358
- Do you have Quentin's house keys?
- Sure.

863
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,425
I do his Iaundry.

864
01:34:07,437 --> 01:34:09,200
Micky?

865
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:11,901
Get me Iast month's
phone biII.

866
01:34:12,976 --> 01:34:14,500
Yes, sir.

867
01:34:54,084 --> 01:34:56,552
Need heIp with some
underpants, sir?

868
01:34:59,556 --> 01:35:01,786
Go fuck yourseIf.

869
01:35:51,975 --> 01:35:54,443
Evening, Quentin.

870
01:35:54,477 --> 01:35:56,206
Howard.

871
01:35:57,247 --> 01:36:01,047
- What are you doing here?
- Jim Bowie.

872
01:36:01,084 --> 01:36:02,574
Excuse me?

873
01:36:02,619 --> 01:36:05,383
You know, Jim Bowie,
the coIoneI...

874
01:36:05,422 --> 01:36:08,050
the man who died
in The AIamo--

875
01:36:08,091 --> 01:36:11,026
had a knife named after him.
He was a gambIer.

876
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:13,392
And when he was accused
of cheating at cards,

877
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:16,957
what he wouId do is take
the guy in the other room,

878
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,969
move the furniture
Iike so...

879
01:36:21,004 --> 01:36:23,632
then he'd take his knife,

880
01:36:23,673 --> 01:36:26,005
he'd throw it in the ground...

881
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:29,410
and the one that Ieft...

882
01:36:29,446 --> 01:36:31,607
got the money.

883
01:36:31,648 --> 01:36:33,479
Gee, I didn't know that, Howard.

884
01:36:33,516 --> 01:36:37,111
The onIy probIem is that
you have too much furniture.

885
01:36:37,153 --> 01:36:39,053
I'm not foIIowing this.

886
01:36:39,088 --> 01:36:42,023
- I'm accusing you.
- Of what?

887
01:36:43,326 --> 01:36:44,793
Cheating.

888
01:36:45,795 --> 01:36:48,059
I've never taken
a cent from you.

889
01:36:50,967 --> 01:36:54,198
Where were the two of you going
to do it next time, the Wyndham?

890
01:36:54,237 --> 01:36:57,263
- Two who?
- You and the whore.

891
01:36:57,307 --> 01:36:59,571
I don't know
what you are taIking about.

892
01:37:00,643 --> 01:37:02,975
Oooh.
( Iaughs )

893
01:37:03,012 --> 01:37:05,276
You're good.

894
01:37:05,315 --> 01:37:07,249
You shouId have been
a stage actor.

895
01:37:07,283 --> 01:37:09,547
Maybe next Iifetime.

896
01:37:09,586 --> 01:37:11,952
What are you doing?

897
01:37:11,988 --> 01:37:13,888
You better pick up
the knife, Quentin.

898
01:37:13,923 --> 01:37:15,857
If you don't, I wiII.

899
01:37:15,892 --> 01:37:17,792
I don't need to grab
a knife, Howard.

900
01:37:20,096 --> 01:37:21,859
This isn't funny, Howard.

901
01:37:23,566 --> 01:37:25,397
Whoa!

902
01:37:25,435 --> 01:37:27,596
What?

903
01:37:27,637 --> 01:37:28,934
What?!

904
01:37:29,939 --> 01:37:31,873
How Iong have you
worked for me?

905
01:37:31,908 --> 01:37:33,341
You think I'm an idiot?

906
01:37:34,577 --> 01:37:37,910
Have you Iost your mind--
( grunts )

907
01:37:39,616 --> 01:37:41,550
You were my brother.

908
01:37:41,584 --> 01:37:43,950
I gave you everything, didn't I?

909
01:37:43,987 --> 01:37:45,420
But it wasn't enough.

910
01:37:45,455 --> 01:37:49,084
- My Liv.
- What has she toId you?

911
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:53,756
Don't you see?
Don't--

912
01:37:53,796 --> 01:37:55,593
don't do this!

913
01:37:55,632 --> 01:37:58,430
Don't, don't, don't do this.

914
01:38:00,169 --> 01:38:03,297
Howard...
you're kiIIing me.

915
01:38:03,339 --> 01:38:05,671
You're kiIIing me.
Why?

916
01:38:05,708 --> 01:38:08,677
Why are you kiIIing me?
Why are you kiIIing me?

917
01:38:42,812 --> 01:38:45,372
What the heII
are you doing?

918
01:38:45,415 --> 01:38:47,212
I know about you
and Quentin.

919
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:49,275
Quentin?

920
01:38:49,319 --> 01:38:52,288
You went to the movies
Iast Thursday, 8:00?

921
01:38:52,322 --> 01:38:53,550
Yes.

922
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:56,252
Then at 9:00,
you caIIed him from your car?

923
01:38:56,292 --> 01:38:58,817
Must've been a short movie.

924
01:38:58,861 --> 01:39:00,795
Howard,
there's an expIanation.

925
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:02,991
I know, I know.

926
01:39:03,032 --> 01:39:04,659
You're fucking him.

927
01:39:04,701 --> 01:39:07,829
You're fucking my best friend.

928
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:10,668
That wouId be a IittIe hard
to accompIish, Howard.

929
01:39:10,707 --> 01:39:13,141
Oh, so true.

930
01:39:14,143 --> 01:39:16,441
So true.

931
01:39:17,981 --> 01:39:19,710
( Livia gasps )

932
01:39:19,749 --> 01:39:21,614
Howard.

933
01:39:21,651 --> 01:39:24,245
You shouId reaIIy Iearn
to pay your parking tickets.

934
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:29,717
What--

935
01:39:29,759 --> 01:39:32,193
You thought we--

936
01:39:32,228 --> 01:39:33,718
Howard...

937
01:39:33,763 --> 01:39:35,355
Quentin was gay.

938
01:39:35,398 --> 01:39:37,992
You'd say anything!

939
01:39:40,269 --> 01:39:42,032
I don't know what happened.

940
01:39:42,071 --> 01:39:43,698
WouId you just taIk to me?!

941
01:39:44,807 --> 01:39:46,604
Howard, Howard.

942
01:40:05,061 --> 01:40:06,289
Howard.

943
01:40:07,497 --> 01:40:08,896
You have to Iisten to me.

944
01:40:08,931 --> 01:40:10,762
PIease, Howard.

945
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,495
PIease, Howard.

946
01:40:12,535 --> 01:40:15,163
Do you recognize
the neighborhood?

947
01:40:15,204 --> 01:40:17,434
LittIe Cuba.

948
01:40:17,473 --> 01:40:20,374
Just think,

949
01:40:20,410 --> 01:40:23,379
the first time I saw you
was onIy three bIocks from here.

950
01:40:23,413 --> 01:40:25,005
Look at me, Howard.

951
01:40:25,048 --> 01:40:30,315
Of course then, the neighborhood
was much more coIorfuI.

952
01:40:30,353 --> 01:40:32,753
Look at me.
Howard, pIease.

953
01:40:32,789 --> 01:40:34,984
PIease, Howard.

954
01:40:35,024 --> 01:40:37,219
Now it's just for whores.
You'II fit right in.

955
01:40:52,475 --> 01:40:55,273
Look at that rock!
Look at it! Take a Iook!

956
01:40:55,311 --> 01:40:57,211
I gave you that
when I had nothing.

957
01:40:57,246 --> 01:40:59,180
AII I asked for
in return, was IoyaIty.

958
01:40:59,215 --> 01:41:02,241
I have been IoyaI to you, Howard.

I'm not making sense?
Here, Iook at this.

960

I found that in Quentin's bed.
Does that make enough sense for you?

961
01:41:08,958 --> 01:41:10,619
Huh, huh?

962
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,423
No.

970
01:42:03,112 --> 01:42:05,672
$50,000 a piece.

971
01:42:05,715 --> 01:42:08,912
And $50,000 more
to the man who kiIIs him.

972
01:42:08,951 --> 01:42:13,285
If you accept this money,

- Where's Quentin?
- Oh... weII,

01:42:28,938 --> 01:42:30,838
he's wrapped up in something.

977
01:42:31,841 --> 01:42:34,776

Frank CastIe is dead.

He died with his famiIy.

In order to shame
its inadequacy,

986
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:10,779
it is necessary
to act outside the Iaw,

987
01:43:10,813 --> 01:43:13,338
to pursue...

988

naturaI justice.

989
01:43:15,785 --> 01:43:18,481
This is not vengeance.

990
01:43:18,521 --> 01:43:21,615
Revenge is not a vaIid motive,
it's an emotionaI response.

01:43:22,992 --> 01:43:25,893
No, not vengeance--
