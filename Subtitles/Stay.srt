1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,402
Hey, watch where you're
going, you old klutz...

3
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,033
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You gonna pick that up?

4
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,044
Pervert.

5
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,774
You're late. I've been
looking all over for you.

6
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:05,046
I slept right through the alarm clock.
That baby kept me up all night.

7
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:09,418
- What baby?
- I don't know. Our neighbors have a kid?

8
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,048
Our neighbors are 90 years old.

9
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,659
You want to try and get
the paint on the canvas.

10
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,459
I like it messy.

11
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,798
Oh, yeah?
I gotta go.

12
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,174
Hey...

13
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:38,678
I just start drinking
and doing a lot of, like, pills.

14
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:42,017
'Cause then it just kills the pain,
and then I can just deal with it later.

15
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,622
I'm just saying- I'm not
telling you to go drink.

16
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,493
I know you go to meetings.
I'm just telling you what works for me, okay?

17
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,864
It's hard to deal with those feelings.
Well, drinking kills feelings. That's why.

18
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,964
It's gonna hail this afternoon.

19
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:03,271
You think?
Looks pretty sunny to me.

20
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,971
Who the fuck are you?

21
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,015
I'm Dr. Sam Foster.
You must be Henry.

22
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,550
Where's Dr. Levy?

23
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,018
Didn't she get in touch with you?

24
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,180
No.

25
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,259
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's away for a while.

26
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,056
- I'm covering for her.
- She's away where?

27
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:25,189
She's not feeling well.
She'll be back in a couple of weeks.

28
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,501
What are you-
a substitute shrink?

29
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,172
I guess you could call me that.

30
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,073
Oh.

31
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:39,339
This is her office.

32
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:44,316
Yeah, we share it. I'm only here
a few hours a week. Please take a seat.

33
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,886
Oh, I see.

34
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:50,856
So you treat the, uh...

35
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,052
depressed investment bankers,
paranoid housewives all week?

36
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,426
Come up here to do
a little pro bono work?

37
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,431
It's the other way around.

38
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:03,435
The bankers are paranoid,
and the housewives are depressed.

39
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,069
Now, you're a junior at the college.
Is that right? Majoring in fine art?

40
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,905
She passed me off to you, huh?

41
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,585
You get the hard cases.

42
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,751
Does it make you uncomfortable
that I'm filling in for her?

43
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:32,093
She was trying to help me.

44
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,258
I'll try and help you too.

45
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:39,598
She afraid of me?
Is that why she's gone?

46
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,937
Did I scare her?

47
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:44,773
Should she be afraid of you?

48
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,120
I've read your file.

49
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,787
And can I read your file?

50
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,591
Tell me why you're here.

51
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,793
I thought you read the file.

52
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:12,771
You torched your car.
Why?

53
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,042
I don't remember.
I just woke up...

54
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,840
and I was in the car,
and it was on fire.

55
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,849
Is that something you do-
set fires?

56
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:29,586
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

57
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,984
Who did you hurt?

58
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,358
I don't know.
I'm gonna go.

59
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,936
No. Please, sit down.
We have more time.

60
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:45,938
No, I, uh- I'm gonna go home
before this hail starts.

61
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,477
The king of Poland goes hunting
in the woods with one of his assistants.

62
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,478
And they're looking around...

63
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,038
and suddenly on the other side
of the clearing a farmer walks by.

64
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,618
Hold still.

65
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,880
And the king raises his rifle,
and the farmer yells...

66
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,956
"I'm not a moose."

67
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,890
The king shoots and kills the guy...

68
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,893
and the assistant's shocked.

69
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,259
And he says...

70
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:13,993
"Sire, the man said,
'I'm not a moose."'

71
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:18,003
"Oh," says the king.
"I thought he said, 'I am a moose."'

72
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,902
It's a joke.

73
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,445
No, I'm just trying to figure out...

74
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,607
if I'm the king or the farmer.

75
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:34,246
You're the moose.

76
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:38,314
- I'm the moose?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:44,092
Well, I appear to be the moose.

78
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,693
- It's shit.
- It's not shit.

79
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,870
It's not shit.

80
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:06,012
Still there.

81
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,816
Sometimes I forget.

82
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,552
They're from another life.

83
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,779
Oh, my God.

84
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,658
I love this song.

85
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:01,270
I know you. Psych 221.
Professor Azzopardi?

86
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,808
You did that presentation on psychosis
and Tristan RÃªveur, right?

87
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,111
No smoking on the train.

88
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,786
Look at the sign, fella.
No smoking.

89
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:21,218
Capisce? Put it out.

90
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,728
"Capisce"?

91
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,764
Put out the fucking cigarette.

92
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,216
You oughta be locked up, you asshole.

93
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,458
Beth? Sam. I hope
you're getting some rest.

94
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:01,326
Look, I met with your
patient today- Henry Letham.

95
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,995
I'd really like
to talk to you about him.

96
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,505
Give me a call, okay?
I wanna hear your voice.

97
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:12,976
You don't think it's a little odd-
predicting a hailstorm like that?

98
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,207
So he watches the Weather Channel.

99
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:18,649
No. I looked in the newspaper.
There was nothing about hail today.

100
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,088
How's Beth?

101
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,818
I don't know.
She hasn't returned any of my calls.

102
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,087
She always kinda
liked you, didn't she?

103
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,832
What, are you jealous?

104
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,833
Of Beth?

105
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,836
- I'm just faking it.
- Your students love you.

106
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:41,601
My students love me
'cause I give 'em all A's.

107
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,873
I mean, what the fuck do I know?
This kid could be the next Rothko.

108
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,122
Tell me I'm good.

109
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,131
You're good.

110
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,861
Tell me they'll remember me.

111
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,437
Who's "they"?

112
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,029
The world.

113
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:17,042
Is that what you want?

114
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:22,409
The world will remember you.

115
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:27,752
Now take off your clothes.

116
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,601
Hey.

117
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,408
Who did that?

118
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,645
My girlfriend.

119
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,085
Where'd you get that?

120
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,454
This? I bought it.

121
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,990
Henry, what are you
doing here? l...

122
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,264
I wasn't expecting you.
I have someone coming in.

123
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,542
So, have you considered
a career in meteorology?

124
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,207
Hmm?

125
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:34,048
The weatherman
said something about hail?

126
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,816
The weatherman?

127
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,192
No.

128
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:45,023
You know, I can't even
listen to him anymore?

129
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,669
I don't understand a word
that comes out of his mouth.

130
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,001
You don't understand the weatherman?

131
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,006
No.

132
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,539
But you do?

133
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,673
Sure. He says rain,
I bring an umbrella.

134
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:13,122
Henry, give me something.

135
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,592
I'm good at what I do.

136
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,893
Well, I'm hearing voices now.

137
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,897
Voices?

138
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:33,212
They come and they go,
but when they are there...

139
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,009
You're hearing them now?

140
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,277
Okay.

141
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,357
Can you write down
what they're saying?

142
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,634
- Yeah?
Hey, Dr. Foster. It's Frederick.

143
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,976
Can you read it to me?

144
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,842
- Hmm?
- Can you read it to me?

145
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,318
Uh, yeah.

146
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,186
"Hey, Dr. Foster. It's Frederick."

147
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,787
This is-This voice isn't in your head.
This is a real voice.

148
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,965
Okay. Well, I don't know.

149
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,098
Maybe you could show me
how to tell the difference?

150
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,477
Go on.

151
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,479
I don't know.

152
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,655
"I didn't move him.
I know you're not supposed to move 'em."

153
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,782
"I can't watch anymore."

154
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:58,024
"Stay with me, Henry.
Stay with me."

155
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:02,363
Hey, guys. Sorry
to interrupt, but, uh...

156
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,199
Hey, Frederick,
can you give me a minute?

157
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,502
- I've got a conference call at 11:00.
- Just a minute. Thank you.

158
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,975
Yeah, okay.

159
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,375
Where's this from?

160
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,384
Oh, I burned myself.

161
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,151
You burned yourself? Why?

162
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,020
Practicing for hell.

163
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:33,695
Why do you think you're going to hell?

164
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,995
Um...

165
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,506
'cause of what I did.

166
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,340
What I'm gonna do.

167
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,073
What are you gonna do?

168
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,252
You're gonna try and kill yourself?

169
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,359
And how seriously should I take that?

170
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,157
Saturday at midnight
is when I'm gonna do it.

171
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,858
You gotta know that
everything just changed.

172
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,266
If you talk to me about suicide,
I'm required to take certain actions.

173
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,771
Hey, look. Just wait a second.
Wait a second.

174
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,008
Just, you know, deal with him...

175
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:18,034
Just, you know, deal with him...

176
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:22,172
and, uh, we'll talk
about it next time.

177
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,716
There's a next time?

178
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,718
Yeah.

179
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,913
Yeah.

180
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:34,121
Yeah, we got three days.

181
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,796
He's coming.! He's coming.!

182
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,928
I am not a monster, goddamn you!
Get off of me!

183
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:48,405
Nobody's calling you a monster,
Daisy. Come on now.

184
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,739
Please.! You said you would-
I don't deserve this.!

185
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,212
Well, if you'd just remember to take your pills,
you wouldn't have to go through this.

186
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:59,308
- I'm not a monster. I'm lovable.
- I know you are.

187
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,980
I'm lovable. Stop!

188
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,116
- No, please! I'm lovable.
- Very lovable.

189
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,956
He's coming!
I oughta know he's coming!

190
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:12,589
I'll be good. I'll be good!
I don't want to- No!

191
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,599
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey.

192
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,295
He's just a kid!
He's just a kid!

193
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,237
Okay, now.
Let go, Daisy.

194
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,672
He's just a kid!

195
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,676
He's just a kid.!

196
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,338
Sorry about that.
You okay?

197
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:31,349
Yeah. Yeah. I'm used to dealing
with neurotic stockbrokers.

198
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,715
Neurotic stockbrokers pay better.

199
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,180
So, uh, what brings you to Club Meds?

200
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,691
I have a student
threatening to kill himself.

201
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,820
Christ. Well, tell him
to take a number.

202
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,830
Look, you know how it works.

203
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,662
If he threatens to hurt
himself or someone else...

204
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:51,897
then we can take him in,
but we can't hold him here forever.

205
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,064
He said he's gonna do it on Saturday.

206
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,335
If you take him in now,
he'll be out by then.

207
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:59,276
Organized kid.
He's got it all scheduled.

208
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,904
Saturday, midnight.
That's what he said.

209
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:06,411
We can pick him up Friday,
hold him for the weekend.

210
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,080
As you can see, it's
not a real fun process.

211
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,817
Anything you could do to avoid it?

212
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,519
- What have you got him on?
- He won't take any meds.

213
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,885
Where's my man?

214
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,520
You know what I've
been craving all day?

215
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,897
Something to drink.

216
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,905
What's the matter?
You're looking a little tense.

217
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,379
It's nothing.

218
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,110
So tell me about nothing.

219
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,621
I'm just tired.

220
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:20,284
Let me make a call,
and then we can take a bath together.

221
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,762
Beth, it's Sam again.

222
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,562
Um, I hope you're getting some rest.

223
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,434
Everyone's been asking about you.
Look, give me a call.

224
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,908
I want to speak to you about Henry Letham
and find out how you're feeling, okay?

225
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,044
Bye.

226
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,584
You sound like you're talking
to one of your patients.

227
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,883
- Is she sick?
- She's exhausted.

228
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,924
Exhausted?

229
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,760
Come on. We live in New York City.
Everyone's exhausted.

230
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,195
What, is that a code word?

231
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,600
Yeah.

232
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,729
Yeah, I guess it is.

233
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,816
How's the kid with the hail?

234
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,255
Ever heard of
doctor-patient privilege?

235
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,849
What's the prediction
tomorrow? Locusts?

236
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,088
He's confused.

237
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:33,654
Confused?
Is that like exhausted?

238
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,962
I don't want to get
into this right now.

239
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,971
You told me about the lawyer
who thought her cat was talking to her.

240
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,166
I shouldn't have.

241
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:48,404
He wants to kill himself.

242
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:52,781
That's it, isn't it?
That's why you won't talk about it.

243
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:58,113
- He has a right to confidential counseling.
- Come on, Sam.

244
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:06,496
He wants to kill himself
on Saturday night.

245
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,630
At midnight, like it's a date.

246
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,802
What's so special about Saturday?

247
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:20,778
I didn't have time to ask.

248
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,509
Look, we can talk about it, you know.

249
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,551
It doesn't scare me.

250
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,918
- It scares me.
- Yeah, I know.

251
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:32,992
But you have to trust me.

252
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,361
I do.

253
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,409
- Up slow, Jerry.
- Got it.

254
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,411
- Looking good, Mikey.
- Not-Not so fast.

255
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,413
- Stop that swaying.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.

256
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:59,042
Easy. Easy. Hold it!
Stay clear, you guys. Quick.

257
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,553
Wait.! Wait.! My balloon.!

258
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,055
Sorry, kid.
It's gone to balloon heaven.

259
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:08,093
Oh, that's okay, sir.
We're gonna get another one at the park.

260
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,526
- Go ahead, honey.
- Promise, Mommy?

261
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,928
All right, you guys.
Comin' your way.

262
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:15,160
Tristan RÃªveur once said...

263
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:19,364
"If we cannot see the wind,
we can see the wind's will."

264
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:25,141
Here, Pradilla Ortiz forces us
to imagine the wind...

265
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:27,236
by showing its effect on the smoke...

266
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,748
the candle flames
and DoÃ±a Juana's veil.

267
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:36,547
Only the victims' faces are
visible in Goya's masterwork.

268
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:42,085
Our eyes are drawn
to the brightest spot on the canvas...

269
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:47,132
the white shirt of a doomed man
pleading for his life.

270
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,259
Behind him, the hill closing in...

271
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,669
refusing a path to escape.

272
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:58,005
The Dead Toreador was originally
part of a larger painting...

273
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:01,137
Incident in a Bullfight.

274
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:05,741
After the painting was mocked
by critics and viewers...

275
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,252
Manet angrily sliced it in half...

276
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,622
removing the fallen hero
from his arena...

277
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,250
removing the fallen hero
from his arena...

278
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:17,421
and accidentally creating
one of his most enduring works.

279
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,260
- Hey.
- Hey.

280
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,800
How are you doing?

281
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,802
Oh, you know.

282
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:29,068
I didn't know if you'd still be coming
to class after what you told me.

283
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:32,076
Yeah, well, where else am I gonna go?

284
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,078
Have you got a minute?

285
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,171
Sure.

286
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:39,740
Are any of these yours?

287
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,753
Ouch.

288
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,846
What?

289
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:46,391
Well, these are bad, so...

290
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:50,259
Oh.

291
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:56,125
Do you know that Tristan RÃªveur quote
about bad art?

292
00:23:56,236 --> 00:24:00,468
It's "Bad art is more tragically
beautiful than good art...

293
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:03,007
because it documents
human failure."

294
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,213
Why'd do you want
to do it on Saturday?

295
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,985
It's my 21 st birthday.

296
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:17,648
I think the tradition
is to go out and get drunk.

297
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:21,249
Well, um, Tristan started
a different tradition.

298
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:23,261
What did he do?

299
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,665
He died.

300
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,893
What about your parents?

301
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:35,901
What about 'em?

302
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:38,443
Don't you think they care?

303
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,509
No.

304
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,019
Do they live around here?

305
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,953
They're over in Mahlus Gardens.

306
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,425
Mahlus Gardens-
Where is that?

307
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:58,088
It's a cemetery in Jersey.

308
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:05,065
- I thought you read the file.
- I'm sorry.

309
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,071
I did.
It didn't mention that.

310
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,108
It's a little out of date.

311
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,110
Do you have any other family?

312
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:14,112
No.

313
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:16,273
Girlfriend?

314
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,883
You talked to her?

315
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,289
No.

316
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,259
Who is she?

317
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,396
No, you're not talking to her.

318
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,302
I thought you were talking
about this waitress...

319
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,967
in this diner I used to go to
over on Canal Street.

320
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,977
Tell me about her.

321
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,709
When she filled up my cup of coffee,
she would ask me how I was doing.

322
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:54,184
Waitress things, you know.
It doesn't really constitute a girlfriend.

323
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:57,017
Did you ever get her name?

324
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:59,023
Yeah, it was Athena.

325
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,491
I was gonna marry her.

326
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,523
You were gonna marry her?

327
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,367
Yeah. I bought her
a ring and everything.

328
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:16,909
It looked just like the one
that you got your girl.

329
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:26,478
I didn't steal your ring,
Henry, okay? I promise.

330
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,059
Yeah, I lost it.

331
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,130
Anyway, she's gone.

332
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:43,168
- She's gone?
- Yeah.

333
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,669
- Or she's somewhere else?
- What do you mean?

334
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,172
There is no somewhere else.

335
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,397
He's not going to make it.

336
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:39,053
- It's beautiful.
- No.

337
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:42,423
It's like the crap
tourists buy on Fifth Avenue.

338
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:51,100
- You talk with your student today?
- Mm-hmm.

339
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,166
Still wants to do it?

340
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,640
I don't feel right talking about it.

341
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,377
Talking about it with me, you mean.

342
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:12,222
You stopped taking your pills.

343
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:17,457
I've been counting.
You haven't taken one in weeks.

344
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,554
I don't need 'em anymore.

345
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,600
Well, that's a decision
we should've made together.

346
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:27,401
I can't paint on meds.

347
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,636
I can't.

348
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:39,641
Well, it makes me nervous.

349
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:42,619
I'm not happy you did this in secret.

350
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:47,557
Well, I'm not happy
you're counting my pills in secret.

351
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,152
We have to trust each other.

352
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,829
Hey, look at me.

353
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,372
I can't make them disappear.

354
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,606
I wish I could.

355
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,155
I made you a promise.

356
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,562
I gotta go.

357
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,333
I'll see you at home.

358
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:37,402
Henry?
Forgetting something?

359
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,876
- What's the matter?
- You just called me Henry.

360
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:48,545
- Baby, I think I know your name by now.
- Yeah, but you called me Henry.

361
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:52,351
Sam, I know who you are.
I promise.

362
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,760
Sorry.

363
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,065
Okay.

364
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,682
Do you get nervous?

365
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:18,445
Do you get nervous?

366
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:21,111
It's a great part,
but she should resist more.

367
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,712
- She just takes his abuse and walks into the river.
- You should use that.

368
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,122
- All without a fight.
- Can we come and see you?

369
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,285
- Henry, that would be nice, wouldn't it?
- Yeah, Mom.

370
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,394
We could all go together.

371
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,294
We could all go together.

372
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:38,294
King's rook to E-3.

373
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,072
Mm-hmm.

374
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,768
How's Lila?

375
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:48,574
She's good. Oh,
I got something for her.

376
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,206
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me your hand.

377
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,983
Ah.

378
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,113
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

379
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,556
I hear she's a beautiful girl.

380
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,391
How long have you
been carrying that around?

381
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:06,089
A while.

382
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,393
What are you waiting for?

383
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:11,436
The fear to go away, I guess.

384
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,835
Mm.

385
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,500
How do I know she won't try again?

386
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:18,577
You don't know, Sam.

387
00:31:18,678 --> 00:31:20,737
Does she make you happy?

388
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,973
Oh, yes.

389
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,778
Well, here's something that won't.

390
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,683
Knight to C-3.
Check.

391
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:30,779
Oh, shit.

392
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:37,995
Do you remember the dream
of the burning boy referred to by Freud?

393
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,793
- Vaguely.
- Vaguely meaning no?

394
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,800
- Right.
- Yeah.

395
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:45,871
Well, he describes a man
whose child is dying.

396
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:49,635
The father sits by the boy's bed
night after night...

397
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:53,200
and after the boy is dead,
they give him a wake.

398
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:58,545
And they set up a circle of candles
around the boy's body.

399
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:02,087
And the father's exhausted.
He falls asleep.

400
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:06,056
And he dreams that his son
is standing beside him...

401
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:10,128
holding his arm and whispering...

402
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,891
"Father, can't you see
that I'm burning?"

403
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:15,832
- You have a visitor?
- Henry.

404
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,926
- I can come back.
- No, no. You're all right.

405
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:20,062
- I don't mind.
- Do you know Dr. Patterson?

406
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:23,164
- No.
- Pleased to meet you.

407
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:32,007
What's the matter, Henry?

408
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,721
What the fuck?

409
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:42,089
What are you doing here?

410
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,856
We're playing chess.

411
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,159
You're dead.

412
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:51,168
- Sam?
- I watched you die.

413
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,830
Sam, we'll finish this game later.

414
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,736
Sure.

415
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:59,572
- Where are you going?
- Henry, take a seat.

416
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,080
- Why'd you come back?
- Do you know Leon?

417
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:06,083
What did he say to you?
Did he say something about me?

418
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:09,279
No, he didn't say anything about you.
I don't think Leon even knows you.

419
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:14,050
That's my father.

420
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,128
He knows me.

421
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:19,288
Now, listen, I've known Leon a long time.
He doesn't have any children.

422
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:22,526
Don't say that! Don't
fuckin' say that to me!

423
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:25,798
What are you doing?

424
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:28,373
Do you think I don't
recognize my own father?

425
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:31,409
- You told me your father was dead.
- He is dead.

426
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,911
He's dead, and that's him
walkin' out the fuckin' door!

427
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,642
The man walking out the door
is alive and well.

428
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,742
What's happening?

429
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:44,050
I saw all the blood,
and I watched him die.

430
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,092
I did it.

431
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:51,652
It's my fault.

432
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:54,562
Maybe you hurt someone, but not Leon.

433
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,329
Who did you hurt?
Your father?

434
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:02,169
I don't remember.

435
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:06,643
Sometimes we don't want to remember,
but I think you have to try.

436
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,610
Fuck you! What the fuck
do you know!

437
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:14,618
You don't know anything!
Everything you know is a fuckin' lie!

438
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,712
- All right?
- Okay.

439
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:20,485
Tell me what the truth is.

440
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:29,190
Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.

441
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,871
Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.

442
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:39,001
Yes, Henry.

443
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:42,012
Henry?

444
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,384
Henry?

445
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:51,488
Henry.!

446
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,692
Henry.!

447
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,028
Henry?

448
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:05,365
Henry, are you there?

449
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,889
Here we go.

450
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:58,916
Trouble.

451
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,283
Henry, listen.

452
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,979
Stay with me, okay?
Listen to my voice, Henry.

453
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:32,819
- Stay with us here, all right?
- Is that your voice?

454
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:38,353
I didn't leave that message.

455
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:41,797
Probably someone who
sounds exactly like you.

456
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:44,096
So what do we do now?

457
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:46,103
Not much we can do at this point.

458
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:50,232
We don't have the resources or the manpower
for a stakeout or anything like that.

459
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,776
I'll notify the police,
but they won't do anything.

460
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,778
Why not?

461
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,782
Because they've got more important things
to do than look for depressed college students.

462
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,613
Then I'll find him.

463
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,653
Well, if you do, give me a call.

464
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:05,246
We'll pick him up for you.
But do me a favor, Sammy.

465
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:08,087
The kid hears voices
and carries a gun.

466
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:09,922
Watch your back.

467
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,666
Mommy, is that man gonna die?

468
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,804
Come on, Bobby.
We're gonna be late.

469
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,778
You shouldn't run away from me like that,
you little monkey.

470
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:30,872
But is he gonna die?

471
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,721
Listen to this.

472
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:40,724
"Henry Letham has a fertile,
powerful imagination.

473
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:45,286
If he maintains his concentration,
he will create new worlds with his art."

474
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:48,161
Jim O'Shea?

475
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,360
Professor O'Shea, yeah.
How'd you know?

476
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:54,132
'Cause Jim wants to fuck
every cute boy in his class.

477
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,403
- Did you ever hear of an artist named Tristan RÃªveur?
- Yeah, of course.

478
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,206
- Do you like his work?
- I've never seen it. Nobody has.

479
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:03,804
He burned all his paintings
before he killed himself.

480
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,816
- He killed himself?
- Mm-hmm.

481
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:08,546
When he was 18, he told everyone
he'd live three more years...

482
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,713
then go to New York and kill himself.

483
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:14,759
And that's exactly what he did.
Left a one-line note:

484
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,354
"Un suicide Ã©lÃ©gant
est I'oeuvre d'art finale."

485
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,332
"An elegant suicide is
the ultimate work of art."

486
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:25,733
Ah, Jesus.
He's Henry's favorite artist.

487
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:27,863
Of course he is.

488
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,413
Let me talk to him.

489
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,846
Talk to him?
First I've gotta find him.

490
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,943
He'll find you. He knows you can help him.
That's exactly why he keeps coming back to you.

491
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:44,579
Well, even if he does,
I can't let you talk to him.

492
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,715
I'd violate every rule in the book.

493
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:51,922
So violate them. You have something, Sam.
This kid trusts you.

494
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:55,694
But you've never stood where
he's standing right now, and he knows that.

495
00:38:55,801 --> 00:39:00,431
Yeah, but I treat people every day
with conditions I've never experienced myself.

496
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,306
You know, the day I did it...

497
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:09,711
I took two razor blades
to the bathtub.

498
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:13,080
You know why?

499
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:17,713
Because I knew that
once I started to bleed, I'd get weak...

500
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:22,226
and I didn't want to drop one blade
and leave myself half done.

501
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:26,462
Can you imagine that?

502
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:29,557
Can you imagine hating
your life so much...

503
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:32,501
that you want to bring a backup razor?

504
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,287
So what do I tell him?

505
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:55,860
There's too much beauty to quit.

506
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:02,190
Tell him that.
There's too much goddamn beauty.

507
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,880
Eat something.

508
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:19,815
I'm not hungry.

509
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,819
Eat your fortune cookie.

510
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,989
It's yours.

511
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,907
"Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you."

512
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,670
Not a moment too soon.

513
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,713
What's the matter?

514
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:08,566
- Beth, it's Sam.
- I didn't touch him.

515
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,568
- Beth? Beth?
- I know you're not supposed to move...

516
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:28,684
Beth?

517
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:32,281
Beth?

518
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:34,359
It's me.

519
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:37,622
Are you okay?

520
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,629
I'm gonna turn on the light, okay?

521
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:53,910
I know Leon's been trying
to get through to you.

522
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,912
And Toni.

523
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,915
Oh, Jesus.

524
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:09,321
Beth, are you gonna talk to me?

525
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:12,124
What do you want to talk about?

526
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,501
How are you feeling?

527
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:20,094
What do you really wanna talk about?

528
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,402
I'm worried about you...

529
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:27,706
and I wanna know more
about Henry Letham.

530
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:29,974
I didn't touch him.

531
00:42:30,082 --> 00:42:33,074
I know you're not
supposed to move them.

532
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:34,952
What does that mean?

533
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:35,851
What does that mean?

534
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:41,583
I wanna kiss you.
Do you want to play a kissing game?

535
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,092
Beth.

536
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:48,030
No. You're loyal.

537
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:52,467
You're a good dog.
Good, loyal dog, Sam.

538
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:55,930
What's her name?

539
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,941
Lila?

540
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:01,206
You should've let her
bleed in the bathtub.

541
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:04,680
- She had the right idea.
- What are you talking about?

542
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:07,877
It's highly inappropriate.

543
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:12,047
You're not supposed to fuck your patients,
even the pretty ones.

544
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:14,182
You know the rules.

545
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:18,491
- You can't drink while you're taking these.
- Mm. Apparently I can.

546
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:22,033
No, you can't. Come on, Beth.
I want you to come take a shower.

547
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:24,996
Bathe the corpse.

548
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,469
We won't really be corpses
though, will we?

549
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:30,132
It will be more
like a memory of nothing.

550
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:32,676
What happened to you, Beth?

551
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:37,078
- I need to sleep, please.
- No, you got too much crap in your system.

552
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:39,241
Are you okay to shower?

553
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:42,377
- He's watching us.
- No, we're alone.

554
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:46,423
- He's watching.
- Are you still talking to him?

555
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:49,153
- Do you know where he is?
- Ask the mother.

556
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:52,196
- The mother's dead.
- Is she?

557
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,231
Ask anyway.

558
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,358
Hello? Hello? Yeah.

559
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,698
This is Sam Foster,
Dr. Sam Foster.

560
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:02,365
I'm a psychiatrist. Yeah.

561
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:06,001
I'm calling about a student
named Henry Letham.

562
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,906
He is?

563
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:12,483
This is very strange, Mrs. Letham.

564
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:16,714
He told me you had passed-
Hello? Hello?

565
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,915
Damn it.

566
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:25,258
This is it.
I won't be long.

567
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:46,916
I've been waiting for you.

568
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,952
Mrs. Letham?

569
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:52,785
I'm Dr. Sam Foster.
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.

570
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:55,189
I thought you'd never come.

571
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:59,389
I would have come earlier.
I didn't know you were here.

572
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:02,695
It's easy to forget about me...

573
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,894
all alone up here.

574
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:08,302
Your son's not well.
That's why I'm here.

575
00:45:08,407 --> 00:45:10,307
I'm trying to find him.

576
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:14,004
I'm sorry to say he's threatened
to commit suicide.

577
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:18,412
You came to see Olive,
didn't you? Not me.

578
00:45:18,517 --> 00:45:20,576
Olive?

579
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:24,815
There she is.
She's been lonely.

580
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,824
Me and Olive keep each other company.

581
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:31,589
We've been alone in this house
for a thousand years.

582
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:36,325
Hey, Olive.

583
00:45:36,435 --> 00:45:38,801
How are you doing, girl?

584
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:41,634
She doesn't remember you.

585
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:47,638
- Are you hungry?
- No.

586
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,941
Do you know how to contact your son?

587
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:52,676
Are there any relatives or friends
he might have gone to see?

588
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,481
Let me fix you something to eat.

589
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:01,184
You stay with Olive.
There's some leftovers in the fridge.

590
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:06,856
Most days I don't say a single word.

591
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:10,799
Sometimes I'm silent so long,
I forget how to speak.

592
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:19,304
Mrs. Letham,
we have an emergency here.

593
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:21,311
You...

594
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:24,246
Do you hate me?

595
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:27,808
You must hate me.

596
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:31,315
Is that why you did it?

597
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,653
No, I don't hate you.

598
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,924
I'm here because your son needs help.

599
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:42,099
I knew you'd come eventually.

600
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,795
It's been quiet without you.
Lonely.

601
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:50,204
Mrs. Letham, who do you think I am?

602
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:53,607
Don't play games.
Not anymore.

603
00:46:53,712 --> 00:46:55,771
Who am I?

604
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:58,611
You think I don't know you, Henry?

605
00:46:58,717 --> 00:47:01,777
You think I don't
recognize my only son?

606
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:06,415
Oh, Lord, I've missed you.
I've missed you so much.

607
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:10,661
I know you never meant to hurt us.

608
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:14,095
- Mom?
- Yes, baby.

609
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,667
How did I hurt you?

610
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:21,296
It doesn't matter anymore.
I could never stay angry with you.

611
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,309
What do I do on Saturdays?

612
00:47:27,646 --> 00:47:32,174
When you were a boy,
you used to go to the zoo.

613
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:37,779
Remember? You loved
to watch the walrus swim.

614
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:40,289
But I'm older now.

615
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:44,590
It's my 21 st birthday tomorrow.
What'll I do for my birthday?

616
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:51,157
Who knows?
You don't tell me anything these days.

617
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:54,238
I guess you tell Athena
your secrets now.

618
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:58,241
Athena?
Do you remember where Athena lives?

619
00:47:58,343 --> 00:48:00,573
Dogs are a big responsibility, darling.

620
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:03,944
Look at the mess I'm making.

621
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,847
- I just have to clean it up.
- Let me see your head.

622
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:08,977
- You don't want to see.
- Mrs. Letham.

623
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,749
You didn't mean to hurt anyone.
You know you didn't.

624
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:14,347
Let me look at your head.
That's a serious wound.

625
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:18,122
Don't look at me, darling. Don't...

626
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,459
Olive, off!

627
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:24,092
Olive, off!

628
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:26,295
Let me fix you something to eat.

629
00:48:28,607 --> 00:48:31,508
You're a bleeder, huh?

630
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,840
Here, maintain pressure on that.

631
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:40,241
Dr. Foster?
Could I have a word with you?

632
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:45,956
Yeah, you got bit up pretty good.

633
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:49,356
- Get your rabies shot already?
- Yeah.

634
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:55,626
Look, I'm, uh-
I'm Sheriff Kennelly.

635
00:48:55,734 --> 00:48:59,033
Now, l-I know you already
spoke with Deputy Carlyle...

636
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:02,868
but I just wanted
to confirm a few things.

637
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:07,877
You said the, uh- the assault took place
at 9625 Rickover Street?

638
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:10,914
- That's right.
- The home belonging to the Letham family?

639
00:49:11,016 --> 00:49:14,577
Right. Her dog attacked me,
and... she needs some help.

640
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:17,211
She has a severe head wound.
She should be in a hospital.

641
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:19,517
I went to high school
with Maureen Letham.

642
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,991
Oh, yeah? Maybe you know her son, Henry.
He's a patient of mine.

643
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:26,530
I remember Henry.
Pale, skinny kid, always drawing pictures.

644
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,725
- Yeah, that's him.
- He kind of gave me the creeps.

645
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:32,394
What's strange, Doctor...

646
00:49:32,504 --> 00:49:34,870
What I'm trying to figure out is...

647
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:38,704
who you were speaking with
over there at 9625 Rickover Street.

648
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,938
I'm sorry. I thought we already
established Maureen Letham.

649
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,777
She told you her name
was Maureen Letham?

650
00:49:44,883 --> 00:49:46,908
Yeah. We were talking
about her son.

651
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:49,452
She wasn't entirely coherent.
She needs medical assistance.

652
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:52,352
But why did you want to talk
to this woman at 1:00 in the morning?

653
00:49:52,457 --> 00:49:55,119
Look, I'm treating her son.
It's an emergency situation.

654
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:58,593
The- Sheriff, she needs help.
She's lost a lot of blood.

655
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:03,458
I told you I went to school
with Maureen Letham.

656
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:06,128
I also went to her funeral.

657
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:09,297
She's been dead for months.

658
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:11,898
Car wreck-
her and her husband.

659
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,844
As far as I know, that house is empty still.
The family's trying to sell it.

660
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:19,110
I spoke to Maureen Letham an hour ago.

661
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:22,618
It's probably just someone's confused.

662
00:50:24,723 --> 00:50:26,748
So how long they keeping you here?

663
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:30,760
I don't know. I gotta head back into the city.
Look, 9625 Rickover Street.

664
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:33,922
I was there.
Henry's mother was there.

665
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:36,523
All right, Dr. Foster.

666
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:39,330
We'll be in touch.
I've got your number.

667
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:46,834
Sheriff?

668
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,273
Sheriff?

669
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,816
- Uh-huh.
- Mrs. Letham...

670
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:55,909
Did she have brown eyes?

671
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,512
Oh, no, sir.
Bluest eyes in town.

672
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:48,234
No, no, no, no, no.

673
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:28,638
- Doing good. Up slow, Jerry.
- Mommy, hurry up.!

674
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,174
- I got it.
- Not so fast.

675
00:53:31,276 --> 00:53:33,075
- Stop that sway. Easy.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.

676
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:33,668
- Stop that sway. Easy.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.

677
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:37,077
- Hold it. Stay clear, you guys.
- Oh! Wait. Wait!

678
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:39,911
My balloon.!

679
00:53:40,018 --> 00:53:42,009
Sorry, kid.
It's gone to balloon heaven.

680
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,987
That's okay, sir. We're gonna
get another one at the park.

681
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:47,023
- Go ahead, honey.
- Promise, Mommy?

682
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:50,253
Comin' at you, guys.
Comin' your way.

683
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:54,092
You were here on Thursday, right?
You were moving the piano on Thursday too, right?

684
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:56,666
- Can I help you with something?
- Yeah, the kid and the balloon...

685
00:53:56,768 --> 00:53:59,999
- The same thing happened on Thursday, right?
- We're a little busy here.

686
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:02,072
Why don't you go bother
someone else, huh?

687
00:54:02,173 --> 00:54:06,337
Your way, guys! There you go.
Watch that thing. That's it.

688
00:54:11,149 --> 00:54:13,049
Christ!
Where have you been?

689
00:54:16,154 --> 00:54:18,145
What happened to you?

690
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:21,623
I've been calling people all over the city,
looking for you.

691
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:25,992
- I was about to call the police.
What happened to you?

692
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:29,498
I've been calling people all over the city,
looking for you.

693
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,898
Christ!
Where have you been?

694
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:34,471
I've been calling people all over the city,
looking for you.

695
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:37,735
I was about to call the police.
What's going on, Sam?

696
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:40,936
- I don't know.
- No, you've gotta talk to me. I've been up all night.

697
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,945
- What happened to your arm?
- Dog bite.

698
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:45,277
- Dog bite?
- Yeah, I had the shots and the painkillers.

699
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:48,113
- What dog? Where?
- Look, I'm seeing things that don't make any sense...

700
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:50,380
and I'm meeting people that
are supposed to be dead...

701
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,388
and Beth's had a nervous breakdown.

702
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:55,391
The kid I'm treating knows
what's gonna happen before it happens.

703
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:59,224
- Okay, just slow down.
- And I saw the same boy lose the same balloon twice.

704
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:02,197
- Baby, you're not making any sense.
- No, nothing makes any sense.

705
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,530
- You're scaring me.
- Nothing makes any sense.

706
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,832
Okay. You just need
to relax. Slow down.

707
00:55:07,939 --> 00:55:09,873
- Okay.
- Hey, you need to sleep.

708
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:12,841
Yeah. No, I can't.

709
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:15,344
- I gotta find him. I'm running out of time.
- No, no.

710
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:17,914
- Just for a while. Lie down.
- You think?

711
00:55:18,016 --> 00:55:21,076
All right. All right.

712
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:23,676
Maybe just for a little bit.

713
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:26,621
Okay.

714
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:29,352
Maybe just a little bit.

715
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,507
Jesus Christ.

716
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:25,243
I've been looking all over for you.

717
00:56:27,085 --> 00:56:30,452
I want you to come uptown with me.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

718
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:34,323
I don't wanna go uptown.

719
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,157
I met your mother last night.

720
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:45,534
What do you mean, you met my mother?

721
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:47,934
You told me she was dead.

722
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:50,098
She's okay?

723
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,971
Yeah, everyone seems to think
your mother's dead...

724
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,237
but I'm standing in a kitchen
talking to her.

725
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:56,142
Sh-She's gonna be okay?

726
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:59,045
I don't know. She's sick.
She got hurt somehow. I don't know.

727
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,482
Is she mad?

728
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:04,054
- The dog seemed pretty fuckin' mad.
- What dog?

729
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:08,023
- Olive.
- Olive?

730
00:57:08,126 --> 00:57:10,094
Yeah, we put Olive
to sleep when I was 12.

731
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:12,059
She had a tumor in her liver.

732
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:15,462
Well, Olive's not dead.
She is very much not dead.

733
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,557
Yeah, she is.
But she was a good girl.

734
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:20,330
Quit playing with me.
I wanna know what's going on.

735
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:24,397
How do you know the future?
I wanna help you, but...

736
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:26,242
- I need some fuckin' answers!
- What happened to your parents?

737
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,768
- I need some fuckin' answers!
- What happened to your parents?

738
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:36,651
Look, there are things that you have to tell me.
I mean, I mean...

739
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:39,314
if you were just gonna
kill yourself, you'd have done it by now.

740
00:57:39,423 --> 00:57:42,415
So why haven't you?

741
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:45,928
Why do you keep coming to me?

742
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,267
'Cause you're the only one
that can help me.

743
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:57,063
That's why.

744
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:08,285
Henry? Henry?

745
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:09,878
Henry? Henry?

746
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,955
I've seen people go through
what you're going through.

747
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:16,887
I've helped them come out
the other side.

748
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,224
If you work with me, I can help you.

749
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,398
The way you helped your girl?

750
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,671
It's Lila, right?

751
00:58:32,243 --> 00:58:36,009
I've seen the, uh,
scars on her wrists.

752
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:42,075
Did you save her?

753
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,225
She saved herself.

754
00:58:53,297 --> 00:58:55,891
Yeah, but you helped, right?

755
00:58:57,602 --> 00:59:02,198
No. Sometimes suicide is an attempt
for attention. With Lila it wasn't.

756
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:05,469
She put three four-inch vertical slits
in each wrist.

757
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:08,739
She split both sets of ulnar
and radial arteries.

758
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:12,873
By the time I got to her,
she'd lost five pints of blood.

759
00:59:12,984 --> 00:59:16,249
I just pulled her out of the bathtub,
put tourniquets on both arms...

760
00:59:16,354 --> 00:59:19,187
and called an ambulance.

761
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,588
Aren't you afraid
she's gonna do it again?

762
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:25,622
No.

763
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,630
Why?

764
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,200
'Cause she loves me.

765
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:38,934
If she were here, I know she'd say...

766
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:41,568
to open your eyes a little wider.

767
00:59:44,215 --> 00:59:47,616
I know she'd tell you that
there's too much beauty to quit.

768
00:59:56,827 --> 00:59:59,227
She's probably right.

769
01:00:00,498 --> 01:00:04,457
Anyway... it's too late.

770
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:08,062
Henry?

771
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:10,072
I can't let you leave this time.

772
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:12,540
You gotta stay with me.
I gotta take you uptown to meet this...

773
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:14,577
- Get the fuck outta my way.
- No, you gotta come with me to the...

774
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:17,739
- Get outta my way, all right? Move. Move.
- I can't.

775
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:20,681
- I can't let you-
- Let me show you something.

776
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:29,150
I killed my parents.

777
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,823
I killed my mother and my father.

778
01:00:40,271 --> 01:00:42,171
I'm gonna go to hell.

779
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:48,344
Or maybe I'm already there.
I don't know.

780
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:55,551
I'm sorry, Sam.

781
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,858
Don't follow me.

782
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,145
Canal Street.
A diner.

783
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:33,223
Canal Street. A diner. Yeah, which diner?
There's maybe 20.

784
01:01:33,324 --> 01:01:36,487
I don't know, pick one.
Keep the meter running.

785
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:54,339
Excuse me.
Do you have an Athena working here?

786
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:56,936
Yeah. Athena!

787
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,413
- Yeah, what?
- Athena?

788
01:01:59,517 --> 01:02:02,213
What? What do you want?

789
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:05,413
All right, next one.
All right, next one.

790
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,291
All right, next one.

791
01:02:14,365 --> 01:02:16,390
All right.

792
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,400
There's one more.

793
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:27,673
We're running out of options here.
I really don't know what you want.

794
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:30,338
All right.
Just try one more, please.

795
01:02:47,398 --> 01:02:50,424
Excuse me.
Do you have a waitress here named Athena?

796
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,001
- Athena?
- Yeah.

797
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,560
No, never heard of her.

798
01:02:56,874 --> 01:02:59,775
- Can I get a coffee, please?
- Sure.

799
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:16,989
Planning on proposing to Athena?

800
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:22,259
No. Do you know her?

801
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:26,427
- Are we talking about the same girl?
- You a cop?

802
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:30,006
No, I'm more of a matchmaker.

803
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:33,634
Doesn't work here anymore.
But she's in my acting class.

804
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:38,007
She is?
Could you tell me where she lives?

805
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:39,946
What are you, her stalker?

806
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:43,486
No. No.

807
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:46,715
I'm a psychiatrist.

808
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,849
See?

809
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:53,225
A psychiatrist, huh?
So you could write a Xanax prescription.

810
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,060
I could write a Xanax prescription...

811
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,794
for one of my patients
who needed it, yeah.

812
01:03:58,903 --> 01:04:00,837
Okay.

813
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:02,963
Good luck finding Athena.

814
01:04:06,377 --> 01:04:09,244
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.

815
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,110
- Then is the world one?
- A goodly one...

816
01:04:12,216 --> 01:04:15,049
in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons.

817
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:17,746
Denmark being one of the worst.

818
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:19,755
We think not so, my lord.

819
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:22,724
Well, then 'tis none to you,
for there is nothing either good or bad...

820
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:24,726
but thinking makes it so.

821
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:27,490
To me, it is a prison.

822
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:29,930
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.

823
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:32,662
- We already had this conversation.
- Oh, um, uh, wait a minute.

824
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:37,002
Uh, um...

825
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:41,009
- "Why then your ambition"-
- Why then your ambition makes it one.

826
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:43,170
'Tis too narrow for your mind.

827
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,180
I could be bounded in a nutshell...

828
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:47,716
and count myself
a king of infinite space...

829
01:04:47,818 --> 01:04:51,049
were it not that I have bad dreams.

830
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:55,182
- That's my favorite line in the whole play.
- It's a good line.

831
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:57,726
However, my favorite line
of the play is:

832
01:04:57,828 --> 01:05:01,662
"O what a rogue
and peasant slave am I."

833
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:05,599
I have no idea what any of it means,
but I love the word "slave."

834
01:05:05,703 --> 01:05:08,831
I love it. I gotta go.

835
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:12,739
- I've got a solo in choir tomorrow morning.
- Thanks for reading with me.

836
01:05:12,843 --> 01:05:17,439
- You're a good Rosencrantz.
- I know. Bye.

837
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,984
- Hello.
- Hi.

838
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:29,717
I always pictured Hamlet as a man.

839
01:05:29,827 --> 01:05:32,762
That's a bit narrow-minded
of you, isn't it?

840
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:35,991
This is the lesbian Hamlet.
All the parts are played by women.

841
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,330
- Oh.
- I'm joking.

842
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:42,064
I'm Ophelia.
I just get so sick of playing her.

843
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:45,039
Things get tough,
she jumps in the drink.

844
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:47,633
Hamlet hogs all the good lines.

845
01:05:47,745 --> 01:05:49,736
Well, he's notorious for that.

846
01:05:49,847 --> 01:05:52,145
We've met before, haven't we?

847
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:55,446
No, I don't think so.
I'm Sam Foster.

848
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,019
- Athena.
- Hi.

849
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:59,681
Hi. Are you joining the class?

850
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:02,350
No. I've been looking for you,
as a matter of fact.

851
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:05,087
That's flattering. Why?

852
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:09,461
I'm a psychiatrist,
and I have a patient who, uh...

853
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:12,330
likes you very much.

854
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:15,428
That's an unusual way
of trying to get a date.

855
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,707
- What's his name?
- Henry Letham.

856
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,539
- Sounds familiar.
- You served him coffee in a diner a couple of times.

857
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:24,614
You were nice to him. But the way
he tells it, you're the one good thing...

858
01:06:24,715 --> 01:06:27,206
that ever happened to him.

859
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,150
Henry.
Is he very pale, very thin?

860
01:06:30,254 --> 01:06:33,314
- His arms are scarred.
- Yeah, that's him.

861
01:06:33,424 --> 01:06:36,325
He always ate pecan pie with his coffee.
I remember that.

862
01:06:36,427 --> 01:06:38,327
But I never spoke to him
outside the diner.

863
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:40,488
- Oh.
- Except...

864
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:42,622
Yeah? What?

865
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:45,531
I feel really stupid saying this stuff
to a psychiatrist.

866
01:06:45,636 --> 01:06:47,831
- You'll think I'm insane.
- No.

867
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:51,334
I had the strangest feeling about him.

868
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:53,467
I mean, he's this
ragged-looking guy.

869
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:57,069
Probably hasn't bathed in months,
but something about him.

870
01:06:57,181 --> 01:07:00,673
I'd seen him before.
Somewhere.

871
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:03,378
I'd known him.

872
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:07,548
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with him?

873
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:10,559
He's going to kill himself.

874
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:12,390
Why?

875
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:16,023
He thinks he's done something terrible.
That's my guess anyway.

876
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:19,534
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

877
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:24,266
Actually, this probably won't help,
but I did run into him one time at A. Smith's.

878
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,069
- A. Smith's?
- The art bookstore?

879
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:28,235
He was sitting in the back, reading.

880
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:30,245
I don't know.
Maybe he hangs out there.

881
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:33,043
- Where is it?
- Nearby. Come on. I'll show you.

882
01:08:03,781 --> 01:08:06,716
Athena?

883
01:08:06,817 --> 01:08:09,285
Athena?

884
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:15,422
Athena!

885
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:17,653
Athena?

886
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:21,094
Athena! Athena!

887
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:30,601
I'm just trying
to figure out if I'm the king or the farmer.

888
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:44,082
Still there.

889
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,440
- Athena?
- We think not, my lord.

890
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:11,480
Well, then 'tis none to you,
for there is nothing either good or bad...

891
01:09:11,582 --> 01:09:13,174
but thinking makes it so.

892
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:16,446
- To me, it is a prison.
- Prison, my lord?

893
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:18,987
Denmark's a prison.
We already had this conversation.

894
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:34,297
Sonny Rollins. Hmm.

895
01:09:41,612 --> 01:09:43,409
Ah.

896
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,750
- Are you lonely here?
- Who's that?

897
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,916
Who's there?

898
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:59,393
Why isn't Mom with you?

899
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:01,896
I'll call the police.

900
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:04,365
Put the phone down, Dad.

901
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:07,561
It's Henry.

902
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:13,109
Henry?
What are you doing here?

903
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,872
Just wanted to see you one more time.

904
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:31,757
Henry.

905
01:10:31,862 --> 01:10:34,422
I need you to leave now.

906
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:40,000
You can't sneak into people's homes.

907
01:10:42,673 --> 01:10:44,800
I don't wanna go, Dad.

908
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:48,742
You've got the wrong man.

909
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:51,939
I've told you before.

910
01:10:52,049 --> 01:10:53,914
I don't wanna die.

911
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:58,920
You don't have to die.

912
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:01,582
- Will you do something for me, Dad?
- What?

913
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:04,661
- What are you doing?
- It's okay. It's okay.

914
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:08,760
I want you to look at me, okay?

915
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:12,335
Just look at me.

916
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:48,503
It's just lightning.

917
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:54,501
Remember that time we found
all those dead sparrows in the yard?

918
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:58,877
Do you remember that?
They were in that tree that got hit by lightning.

919
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:03,549
Who are you?

920
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,721
I'm your son.

921
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:11,452
No. No.

922
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,831
Tell Mom I love her, all right?

923
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:49,695
You should show your mother your paintings.

924
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,394
- Yeah, well, you know...

925
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:54,595
Doesn't Athena look beautiful tonight?

926
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,502
- They remind me of us when
we met all those years ago.

927
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:59,507
Yeah.

928
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:02,669
How have you guys stayed
so in love after all these years?

929
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:03,680
Well, it's simple...

930
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:05,079
Well, it's simple...

931
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:03,571
We're closed.

932
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:06,267
Ben, let him in.
See what he wants.

933
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:11,070
All right.

934
01:14:15,252 --> 01:14:17,152
Can I help you find something?

935
01:14:17,254 --> 01:14:18,949
Henry Letham.

936
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:21,580
A book by Henry Letham
or on Henry Letham?

937
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:23,955
No, l-I thought
he might be here.

938
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,460
I was told he comes here sometimes.

939
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:29,589
Nobody's here, man,
'cause the store is closed.

940
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:32,133
How about you don't
fuck with me right now?

941
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:38,697
- Smitty, you know a guy named Henry Letham?
- Sure.

942
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:42,107
- Something happen to him?
- Yeah, I need to find him.

943
01:14:42,212 --> 01:14:44,476
I keep telling the kid
to get some sun.

944
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:49,177
It's not healthy spending all your time
in bookstores. Yeah, that's his.

945
01:14:49,286 --> 01:14:52,619
He didn't have any money to pay for the books
he wanted, so he gave me this.

946
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:56,021
I think I got a pretty good deal.
The kid's got talent, huh?

947
01:14:56,126 --> 01:14:58,117
He traded the painting for some books?
Which books?

948
01:14:58,228 --> 01:15:00,128
Tristan RÃªveur.
What else?

949
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:02,164
The kid's obsessed with RÃªveur.

950
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:04,631
- You got any more of his books?
- No, he bought me out.

951
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:07,464
It's all secondhand,
out-of-print stuff.

952
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:11,632
Right. Thanks.

953
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:14,335
So, what do you think?
Is he gonna make it?

954
01:15:14,444 --> 01:15:16,537
What?

955
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:20,377
You think he's got what it takes?

956
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:25,586
Yeah. Yeah.

957
01:17:36,052 --> 01:17:37,952
- Hello?
- It's me.

958
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:41,023
Jesus, Sam, where are you?
Are you okay?

959
01:17:41,124 --> 01:17:44,787
I'm fine. Listen. Tristan RÃªveur killed himself
on his 21 st birthday, right?

960
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:48,591
Oh, God, it's that kid's
21 st birthday today.

961
01:17:48,698 --> 01:17:51,030
Yeah.
How'd he kill himself?

962
01:17:51,134 --> 01:17:54,001
Um, he shot himself
on the Brooklyn Bridge.

963
01:17:54,104 --> 01:17:58,564
He said it was the best artwork
of the 19th century.

964
01:17:58,675 --> 01:18:01,303
- Hello?
- Lila, listen.

965
01:18:01,411 --> 01:18:04,073
I need you to know something.
I trust you.

966
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,672
- I trust you more than anyone in the world.
- What's going on, Sam?

967
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:10,150
Listen, if anything happens tonight,
you know I love you.

968
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:12,084
It's the one thing I know is real.

969
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,179
I'm worried about you.

970
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:17,259
Don't be.
I love you, Lila.

971
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,260
Sam?

972
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:26,825
- Leon?
- I always thought you had brown eyes.

973
01:18:32,642 --> 01:18:35,907
- You can see.
- I can see everything.

974
01:18:36,012 --> 01:18:38,845
- For the first time, I can see everything.
- But how?

975
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:40,916
Henry.
It's all because of Henry.

976
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,314
What's happening to us?

977
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,945
The Buddhists had it right all along.

978
01:19:20,056 --> 01:19:22,251
The world is an illusion.

979
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,389
- What time is it?
- It's 11:33.

980
01:19:27,497 --> 01:19:30,091
Check.

981
01:19:32,302 --> 01:19:33,568
Saturday night in the rain.!

982
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:35,069
Saturday night in the rain.!

983
01:19:35,405 --> 01:19:37,339
You'll never find a cab.

984
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:02,029
Damn it.

985
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:29,455
Listen to my voice, Henry. Stay with me, okay?

986
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,745
Mommy, is that man gonna die?

987
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:55,511
Well, I hope not, baby. I don't think so.

988
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:47,926
Brooklyn Bridge...

989
01:23:21,564 --> 01:23:23,464
Henry.

990
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:42,308
One of the first times I met you...

991
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:45,216
you said...

992
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:46,821
that you didn't know
what was real anymore.

993
01:23:46,822 --> 01:23:48,313
That you didn't know
what was real anymore.

994
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:50,358
And I said that I did.

995
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,485
But I was wrong.

996
01:23:54,497 --> 01:23:57,489
I don't know what's real anymore.

997
01:23:59,235 --> 01:24:01,135
You are.

998
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:05,333
You're real.

999
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:08,410
And you're trying to save me.
You're just too late.

1000
01:24:10,146 --> 01:24:12,410
'Cause I gotta wake up.

1001
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:16,717
You are awake.

1002
01:24:23,893 --> 01:24:27,090
Henry, look around you.

1003
01:24:30,867 --> 01:24:34,064
If this is a dream,
the whole world's inside it.

1004
01:24:49,952 --> 01:24:51,852
This hurts too much.

1005
01:24:55,224 --> 01:24:58,159
- I wish you didn't have to see this.
- Henry.

1006
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,742
It happened in front of me. It was right
in front of me. I was the first one here.

1007
01:25:24,854 --> 01:25:27,516
- I didn't move him. I know you're not supposed to move them.
- Do you have a phone?

1008
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,989
I already called.

1009
01:25:31,561 --> 01:25:34,621
Here, let me help.
I'm a nurse.

1010
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:38,131
He's losing a lot of blood.
I'm gonna straighten up his face, all right?

1011
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:42,363
Okay, maintain pressure on that.
Keep an eye on his pulse.

1012
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:47,403
Can you hear me?

1013
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:50,274
- Should l-
- It's okay.

1014
01:25:53,783 --> 01:25:55,683
You're gonna be all right.

1015
01:26:02,058 --> 01:26:04,356
You're gonna be fine.

1016
01:26:06,929 --> 01:26:09,363
It's okay.

1017
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:19,736
- How are the others?
- They're gone.

1018
01:26:41,631 --> 01:26:43,531
- You said you were a nurse?
- Yeah.

1019
01:26:43,633 --> 01:26:45,225
- What's your name?
- Lila.

1020
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:47,234
Now listen, listen.
Lila here's a nurse.

1021
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:49,702
I want you to listen
to her voice, all right?

1022
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:51,670
- Okay.
- Okay?

1023
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:53,674
I'm gonna go in your pockets
and see if I can find your name.

1024
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:55,243
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right?

1025
01:26:55,344 --> 01:26:58,609
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?

1026
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:05,347
- What's that?
- Is that hail?

1027
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:07,445
No, no, that's not hail.

1028
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,684
- That's just the light.
- Henry? Henry, is that your name? Henry, listen.

1029
01:27:10,793 --> 01:27:14,854
My name is Sam. I'm a doctor, all right?
I'm gonna look after you, okay?

1030
01:27:14,964 --> 01:27:16,932
I need you to try and stay awake.

1031
01:27:17,033 --> 01:27:19,763
I want you to listen to Lila's voice
and just stay awake.

1032
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:22,929
- Stay with us here, okay?
- How old are you, Henry?

1033
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:25,200
What's that?

1034
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,806
- What did he say?
- "Forgive me."

1035
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:34,406
Hey, Henry, listen.
I was driving right behind you.

1036
01:27:34,517 --> 01:27:37,213
You didn't do anything wrong, all right?
Your front tire blew.

1037
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,311
Okay?
It wasn't your fault.

1038
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:42,323
It's not anybody's fault.
You don't have to be sorry.

1039
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:45,417
It's okay.

1040
01:27:45,528 --> 01:27:48,463
So?

1041
01:27:48,564 --> 01:27:51,226
- He's just a kid.
- You're gonna be all right.

1042
01:27:51,334 --> 01:27:53,427
He's just waking up.

1043
01:27:53,536 --> 01:27:55,003
- Stay with us, Henry.
- Stay with us.

1044
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:58,505
Stay with me, okay?
Listen to my voice, Henry.

1045
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:00,939
- Stay with us, okay?
- Did he say something?

1046
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:03,739
He's looking for something.
This ring.

1047
01:28:06,349 --> 01:28:09,477
There you go.
You stay here with us, Henry, okay?

1048
01:28:09,585 --> 01:28:11,485
- Yes.
- Stay awake now.

1049
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:14,613
Honey, you gotta stay with me by the car.
We can't run away from each other.

1050
01:28:14,724 --> 01:28:16,851
Remember I said this?

1051
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:20,087
- Mommy, is that man gonna die?
- No, angel, he's gonna be fine.

1052
01:28:20,196 --> 01:28:22,756
The ambulance is gonna come,
and they're gonna help him out.

1053
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:25,663
- You wanna go and see if they're comin'?
- Where's the fuckin' ambulance?

1054
01:28:25,768 --> 01:28:27,861
- Listen to us.
- Hey, Henry, stay conscious.

1055
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:30,268
- Look at me, Henry. Henry, look at me.
- Stay with us.

1056
01:28:30,373 --> 01:28:32,500
- His pulse is fading.
- Try and stay conscious. Try and stay awake.

1057
01:28:32,608 --> 01:28:35,839
Listen to the voice. Come on, Henry. Henry?

1058
01:28:35,945 --> 01:28:38,709
Henry, look at me.
Open your eyes. Here, look at me.

1059
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,146
- Stay with us here, Henry.
- Stay there. Look at me.

1060
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:44,378
- Is that you?
- What? What?

1061
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:50,390
That's my girl right there.
That's my girl.

1062
01:28:50,493 --> 01:28:55,897
Will you marry me?

1063
01:28:59,468 --> 01:29:02,562
Let's go back to the car.
Come on, let's go.

1064
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:06,664
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

1065
01:29:06,776 --> 01:29:09,677
- Will you marry me?
- Yes, Henry.

1066
01:29:19,622 --> 01:29:24,218
- Henry? Henry? Henry?
- He's not going to make it.

1067
01:29:27,496 --> 01:29:32,365
- Henry, try and stay with us.
- Henry, open your eyes.

1068
01:29:32,468 --> 01:29:36,404
- I can't breathe.
- You can't breathe? Come on. I'll get this loose.

1069
01:29:36,505 --> 01:29:38,166
No.

1070
01:29:42,478 --> 01:29:45,413
- Henry?
- Stay with me, okay? Don't leave me.

1071
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:49,211
I'm not gonna leave you.
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

1072
01:29:49,318 --> 01:29:52,253
Don't be afraid.

1073
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:55,380
You don't have to be sorry.

1074
01:30:01,197 --> 01:30:03,256
- Henry?
- Henry.

1075
01:30:03,365 --> 01:30:06,061
Hey, Henry.

1076
01:30:26,722 --> 01:30:29,782
I know you're not supposed to...

1077
01:30:41,403 --> 01:30:44,236
- May I have your name, ma'am?
- Elizabeth Levy.

1078
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:47,332
Uh, once we get all your information,
detectives are gonna wanna speak with you.

1079
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:48,675
- Okay.
- Take it from here.

1080
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:49,575
- Okay.
- Take it from here.

1081
01:31:10,266 --> 01:31:12,757
Hey, thank you for helping.

1082
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:16,270
I wish we could have done more.

1083
01:31:22,211 --> 01:31:24,941
No one ever asked me
to marry them before.

1084
01:31:31,554 --> 01:31:33,988
Wanna get a cup of coffee somewhere?

1085
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:37,388
I'm never gonna sleep tonight.

1086
01:31:39,094 --> 01:31:41,062
Yeah, I'd like that.

1087
01:31:42,305 --> 01:32:42,331
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
