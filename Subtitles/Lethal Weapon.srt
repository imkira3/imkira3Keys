3
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:43,436
Surprise!

4
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:46,641
Happy Birthday, Daddy!

5
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,700
Make a wish!

6
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,036
I wish...
I'm not going to tell you.

7
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,163
Come on, blow them out!

8
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:08,795
Give me some sugar, girl.

9
00:05:09,296 --> 00:05:12,298
One more candle and the smoke alarm
would've gone off.

10
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:18,137
The big 5-0.

11
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:23,518
You know, your beard's getting gray.
Kind of makes you look old.

12
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,603
It's all right. I still love you.

13
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,356
Bye, Pa.

14
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:18,839
Good morning!

15
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:22,051
- Where's Rianne?
- She's upstairs.

16
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,179
Good morning.

17
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,431
- That's my bacon!
- It's mine now.

18
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:29,808
Don't you close doors around here?

19
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:31,727
Baby, what's this on my tie?

20
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,813
That is an ugly spot.

21
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:37,274
Thanks. Sharp as a tack.

22
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,944
I'm thinking of going on Jeopardy.

23
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,988
Just don't take any questions
about cooking.

24
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,244
Don't step in the egg!

25
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:53,957
What am I thinking? I should have
checked the floor for egg!

26
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:59,295
Do you know a man named
Michael Hunsaker?

27
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,259
Jesus! Michael Hunsaker!

28
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:06,553
- What did he want?
- Your office called.

29
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,013
He's tried to reach you for three days.

30
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:11,099
I haven't talked to him in...

31
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,227
...twelve years!

32
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,396
Wait a minute.

33
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:18,606
That would make me...

34
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:20,984
...fifty!

35
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,111
That means that you're...

36
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:25,697
We're not gonna discuss it.

37
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,615
Forget the eggs.

38
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,621
How come I never heard
of Michael Hunsaker?

39
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:35,582
Just never talked about him.

40
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,292
Vietnam buddy?

41
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,627
Eat your own cake. Vietnam buddy.

42
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,298
Nick and the kids
left without me.

43
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,009
He left without you? Come on,
I never get enough of my baby.

44
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:50,887
This is my New Year's Eve dress.
Do you like it? Isn't it cool?

45
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,514
It's beautiful.

46
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,268
Have a good birthday.

47
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,528
Goddamn heartbreaker!

48
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,668
Happy birthday, Rog!

49
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,679
We got a hooker.

50
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,558
No, it's Dixie. Would you please
tell these bozos to lay off?

51
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,060
You bozos, lay off.

52
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,063
Had a jumper here last night.
She saw it happen.

53
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,190
Get her statement, send her home.

54
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,109
Thanks. I'm beat.
You know how it is.

55
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:48,569
All dressed up, no one to blow.

56
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:52,365
You're hilarious!
I can't believe you damn cops!

57
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:55,284
The jumper's name is Amanda Hunsaker.

58
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,703
Age 22.

59
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:01,957
Prostitute. One arrest,
no convictions. Born in Tennessee.

60
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,876
- Parents...
- What was the name?

61
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,754
The parents.

62
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,382
Michael and Claire.

63
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:11,884
You know them?

64
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:15,930
Right. Find out who bought it,
who's paying the bills.

65
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:18,766
- That will take some looking into.
- So look!

66
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:47,211
Hello, honey.

67
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,922
Give me the number
for Michael Hunsaker.

68
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,842
The man we talked about?
Your Vietnam buddy?

69
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:57,262
- You just mentioned him this morning.
- What's wrong?

70
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:59,764
His daughter just dove out a window.

71
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:05,895
I got it.

72
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,208
Good, huh? Tasty? Smooth?

73
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:33,173
- Yeah, that's good.
- You better fucking believe it.

74
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,467
Let's do it. How much?

75
00:11:35,718 --> 00:11:37,427
How much for how much?

76
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,345
For all of it.

77
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,682
You want it all? He wants it all.

78
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:45,810
- All right!
- Maybe a nice tree to put it under.

79
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,062
You want a tree?

80
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:49,814
I'll tell you what.

81
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,983
I'll give you the best tree
on the lot for nothing.

82
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,694
But the shit's gonna cost you...

83
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:57,696
...a hundred.

84
00:11:57,947 --> 00:11:58,947
That much?

85
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:00,866
That's a fair price.

86
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,495
You only live once.

87
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:06,705
Get this together here.

88
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:09,792
20, 40...

89
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:11,210
...50, 70...

90
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:14,588
- What the fuck?
- Hey, man!

91
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,299
Shut up, I'm losing count.

92
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:20,219
93, 94, 95, 96...

93
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,970
Forget it, dumbshit!

94
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:24,306
One hundred thousand!

95
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,017
One hundred thousand dollars!

96
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,020
A hundred thousand?

97
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:34,733
I can't afford that. Not on my salary.
But look, I got a better idea.

98
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:39,530
Let me say I take the whole stash
off your hands for free...

99
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,742
...and you assholes go to jail.
What do you say?

100
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:49,748
I could read you your rights, but you
already know what your rights are.

101
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:54,961
This badge ain't real.

102
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,504
You ain't real.

103
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,173
You sure are a crazy son of a bitch.

104
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:02,593
I'm crazy?

105
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,763
You think I am crazy?

106
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:07,557
I'll show you...

107
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,105
That's a real badge, I'm a real cop
and this is a real gun.

108
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Okay, pal.

109
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,442
Noses in the dirt, assholes!

110
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,081
Where's your buddy?

111
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:37,128
What do you got?

112
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:40,715
Three down and one loose.
He's got a red shirt.

113
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:42,383
Okay, let's go.

114
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:47,305
Freeze! Give me the gun! Up, up!

115
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:49,932
How's it feel, sucker?

116
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:51,475
Shoot him!

117
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:52,684
Drop it!

118
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:54,603
Shoot him! Shoot him!

119
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,397
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shoot this prick!

120
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:01,109
Shoot him! Somebody
shoot this prick!

121
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:02,819
Shoot me.

122
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:05,363
Shut up! Put them down!

123
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,825
- I warn you! I'm going to shoot you!
- Shoot him!

124
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:10,827
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

125
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:13,204
Shoot me! Shoot him!

126
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,130
Get him out of there.

127
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,133
It ain't worth it.

128
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:35,352
Hey, wait up already!

129
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:05,499
Merry Christmas!

130
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:35,570
I miss you...

131
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:39,908
...Victoria Lynn.

132
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,882
That's silly, isn't it?

133
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,472
I'll see you later.

134
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:07,226
I'll see you much later.

135
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:16,068
Once more with feeling on three.

136
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,073
Damn it, Cooley. Do it on three,
or go on the street.

137
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:28,330
Silent night

138
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,959
Are you telling me
Riggs is playing a game?

139
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:35,671
Sure. He wants the cash.
But he'll come around.

140
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:38,257
That's a very dangerous
attitude to take.

141
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:43,179
Remember, his wife of 11 years
was just killed in a car accident.

142
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:47,308
- He pulls his gun when he shouldn't.
- I know all about him.

143
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:48,767
He's a tough bastard.

144
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:52,271
He's on the edge. I'm telling you,
he may be psychotic.

145
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,440
That's a bunch of psych bullshit.

146
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:57,484
You're making a mistake
by keeping him in the field.

147
00:18:57,819 --> 00:18:59,485
The man is suicidal.

148
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:02,572
You're sure of that diagnosis?
You have no doubts?

149
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:04,490
There are no absolutes in life.

150
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:07,327
End of discussion.
We're going to wait.

151
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:10,288
If he offs himself,
then we'll know I was wrong.

152
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:13,833
You're making a mistake,
because if you're wrong...

153
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,717
Asshole!

154
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,845
Roger, you're
way behind the times.

155
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:30,016
The guys in the 80s aren't tough.
They're sensitive people.

156
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:33,436
They show emotions around women,
shit like that.

157
00:19:35,147 --> 00:19:36,731
I think I'm an 80s man.

158
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:38,483
How do you figure?

159
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:40,151
Last night...

160
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,528
...I cried in bed. How's that?

161
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:47,283
Were you with a woman?

162
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:51,162
I was alone. Why do you think
I was crying? Merry Christmas.

163
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,539
Sounds like an 80s man to me.

164
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,751
- News on the Hunsaker case.
- That was quick.

165
00:19:57,002 --> 00:20:00,379
So was the autopsy.
They're not calling it a suicide.

166
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:04,967
Surprise, surprise. The coroner
found evidence she used barbiturates.

167
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:07,177
Brilliant detective work.

168
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,054
There were pills all over.

169
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:11,682
Right. That's not the surprise.

170
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:14,518
The surprise is the pills were doctored.

171
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,562
The capsules were loaded
with drain cleaner.

172
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:19,022
She'd have died anyway.

173
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,190
This case stinks.

174
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:24,194
You know,
you looked younger with the beard.

175
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,196
Thanks, captain.

176
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:29,157
You shaved the beard.

177
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:30,867
Some detective.

178
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,703
Two more things.

179
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:36,039
The condition
of the sheets indicates...

180
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:39,376
...someone else was
in bed with Amanda. That's "A."

181
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,711
What's "B"?

182
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:44,089
"B" is, you're breaking in
a new partner on this.

183
00:20:44,465 --> 00:20:45,549
Partner again?

184
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:49,177
Some cat on loan from Dope.
Real burnout, on the edge.

185
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:50,554
Perfect.

186
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,141
Gun!

187
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:02,773
Rog, meet your new partner.

188
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,238
I'm too old for this shit.

189
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:15,995
There are those who
say you're a good cop.

190
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:17,621
I try.

191
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:22,335
I heard about the little
stunt yesterday. Pretty heroic.

192
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:26,255
I pulled your file.

193
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,343
Said you worked in the Phoenix
project in Vietnam. That right?

194
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:33,512
Assassination stuff.
It's over, you know.

195
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:35,306
What is?

196
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:37,016
The war.

197
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:38,851
Yes, I know.

198
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:40,853
Just thought I'd remind you.

199
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,316
That's some serious shit you carry.

200
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:48,444
Be my guest.

201
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:57,036
9mm Beretta. Takes 15 in the mag,
one up the pipe...

202
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:00,956
...wide ejection port, no feed jams.

203
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,457
What have you got?

204
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,792
Four-inch Smith.

205
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:06,461
Six-shooter?

206
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:09,631
A lot of old-timers carry those.

207
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:16,638
File also said you're heavy
into martial arts.

208
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:20,225
Tai chi and all that killer stuff.

209
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,853
I suppose we have to register you
as a lethal weapon.

210
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:28,566
Let's just cut the shit.
We both know why I was transferred.

211
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:33,154
Everybody thinks I'm suicidal,
so nobody wants to work with me.

212
00:22:33,364 --> 00:22:35,824
Some think I'm faking
to draw psycho pension...

213
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:40,036
...so nobody wants to work with me.
Basically, I'm fucked.

214
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:41,329
Guess what?

215
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:44,249
- I don't want to work with you.
- Then don't.

216
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:48,670
Ain't got no choice.
Looks like we both got fucked.

217
00:22:48,838 --> 00:22:49,838
Terrific.

218
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,760
God hates me, is what it is.

219
00:22:56,887 --> 00:22:59,097
Hate Him back. It works for me.

220
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:19,700
- Good afternoon, Mr. Mendez.
- How you doing?

221
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:21,201
Did you pat him down?

222
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:24,079
- We went through this already.
- Go through it again.

223
00:23:24,414 --> 00:23:25,581
Who are you?

224
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:28,917
That's hardly important,
but you may call me Mr. Joshua.

225
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,210
Let's go.

226
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,754
Great, swell. Mr. Joshua, huh?

227
00:23:37,552 --> 00:23:39,428
General, Mr. Mendez is here.

228
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:46,935
You call this music? I can get
a better band for half the price.

229
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,939
I don't want to hear any of this shit.
Let's get it right.

230
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:55,277
Mr. Mendez, how are you?

231
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:56,820
I'm fine.

232
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,948
Where did you get him?
Psychos "R" Us?

233
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:01,575
I don't think you're funny.

234
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:04,535
I don't think this whole
goddamn setup is funny.

235
00:24:04,786 --> 00:24:07,455
You're using mercenaries.
Tell me I'm wrong!

236
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,081
You're not wrong.

237
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,751
And you expect me to trust these bozos?

238
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:14,295
My people are loyal to me.

239
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,130
Bullshit.

240
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:17,632
Do you smoke?

241
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:19,884
What does that have to do with it?

242
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:21,052
Do you smoke?!

243
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:24,597
Give me your lighter.

244
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:26,807
- My lighter?
- Your lighter!

245
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:28,601
Okay. Right here.

246
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,353
Here. Take it.

247
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:33,314
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

248
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:34,941
Shut your mouth!

249
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:36,567
Shut up!

250
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:38,319
And don't move.

251
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:45,076
Mr. Joshua, your left arm, please.

252
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:58,005
Hey, you guys are fucking gone.
You know what I am saying?

253
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,341
Jesus Christ, man!

254
00:25:01,343 --> 00:25:04,679
You guys are fucking
crazy, man. Come on!

255
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,601
Have Endo look at that, Mr. Joshua.

256
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,896
Yes, sir.

257
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:18,525
You wish to do business with us, yes?

258
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:19,985
Jesus Christ!

259
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:22,612
You wish to make a purchase, yes?

260
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:26,116
Yes, yes! Jesus Christ, yes.

261
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:31,913
You guys are out there like
fucking Pluto, man. You're gone!

262
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:36,334
The heroin will be here Friday night.
We'll make delivery at that time.

263
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,753
Have the money ready, and no tricks.

264
00:25:39,046 --> 00:25:42,340
If you try anything,
you'll have to talk to Mr. Joshua.

265
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:45,885
Right. Joshua. I got you.

266
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:48,388
Merry Christmas.

267
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:51,558
Yeah, right. You too, pal.

268
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:04,571
Mike...

269
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,534
...the autopsy report showed
that Amanda was poisoned.

270
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:13,871
Even if she hadn't jumped,
she'd still be dead.

271
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:18,250
She was murdered.

272
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,089
Jesus!

273
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,472
I can't take this.
I just can't take this.

274
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:37,603
Why did you try
to get in touch with me?

275
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:43,442
I heard that you were...

276
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:47,613
Somebody told me you were
working out here.

277
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,950
I thought you could get her out.

278
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:53,911
Get her out of what?

279
00:26:56,831 --> 00:27:01,460
Get her out of the stuff she was into.
She was making...

280
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,462
...videotapes.

281
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,632
Pornographic...

282
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:09,926
...videotapes.

283
00:27:10,302 --> 00:27:14,347
I thought maybe you could just
get her out. Help her.

284
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:29,487
Easy, Mike.

285
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:38,246
You owe me, Roger.

286
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:40,373
Remember?

287
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:49,048
I remember.

288
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:53,177
I want you to find whoever's
responsible for this...

289
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:56,681
...however many of them there are.

290
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:03,271
I know you can do it.
Just find them and kill them.

291
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:04,981
I'm a police officer.

292
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,192
I don't give a shit
that you're a police officer!

293
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:10,652
Kill them! Just kill them!

294
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:13,363
Wait. Wait, Rog.

295
00:28:13,573 --> 00:28:16,032
Come on. You find them
and you kill them.

296
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:19,411
You can do that. You owe me.

297
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:24,833
I owe you.

298
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:28,587
Gotta go, man.

299
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,847
What did he mean
when he said you owed him?

300
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:41,433
We served together in 1965.

301
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:45,520
La Drang Valley. Saved my life.
Took a bayonet in the lungs.

302
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:48,440
- That was nice of him.
- I thought so.

303
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:51,818
- Want me to drive?
- You're supposed to be suicidal.

304
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:54,821
Anybody who drives
in this town is suicidal.

305
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:59,117
All units, possible jumper
at Santa Monica and Orlando.

306
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:01,870
7-A-21, handle code two.

307
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:06,583
- All units, come in, please.
- Gotcha!

308
00:29:07,043 --> 00:29:09,461
- What's the number of the car?
- 3-William-56.

309
00:29:09,712 --> 00:29:13,714
3-William-56 en route.
I love this job! It's so exciting!

310
00:29:13,924 --> 00:29:16,592
Copy.
Police psychologist on the way.

311
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,638
Hey, boss, can we put the sirens on?

312
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:37,071
Guys, I'm glad you're here.

313
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,740
- Where's the psychologist?
- Stuck in traffic.

314
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,075
Who's this guy?

315
00:29:41,243 --> 00:29:45,496
Name's McCleary. He was at an
office party and just went outside.

316
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:48,666
- You think he'll go?
- Seems serious enough. Who knows?

317
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:51,794
- I can handle this.
- Are you qualified?

318
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:54,171
- I've done it before.
- You're elected.

319
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:58,092
- No guns, just bring him down.
- Roger.

320
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,010
10-4.

321
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,820
- Who are you?
- Riggs, homicide.

322
00:30:19,113 --> 00:30:20,947
He's over there on the ledge.

323
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:33,710
Merry Christmas.

324
00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:36,713
Leave me alone!

325
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:38,131
What are you doing?

326
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:39,966
None of your damn business!

327
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:42,302
Fair enough.

328
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:45,638
I'm just going to
come out there, okay?

329
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:48,433
Don't!
You touch me, I'm gonna jump!

330
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,145
Take it easy, for chrissake!

331
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:54,689
I don't like this
any better than you do.

332
00:30:55,482 --> 00:30:57,317
I can't stand heights.

333
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:58,818
This makes me dizzy.

334
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:01,487
Just give me a chance
to talk to you.

335
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:06,326
I'm gonna stand
on the ledge with you.

336
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:09,162
Don't go. Not out on the ledge.

337
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,457
You're not the first guy
to think of this, you know.

338
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,585
A lot of people got problems
during this season.

339
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:20,088
- You know shit!
- No, you're wrong, pal.

340
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:22,758
You know nothing! Don't touch me!

341
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,676
I didn't do anything wrong!

342
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:27,846
I know that. It's not like
you're murdering anyone.

343
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:30,015
- That's right!
- That's right.

344
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:33,018
The only one I hurt is me! Me!

345
00:31:33,186 --> 00:31:35,854
That's right. I know
you're hurting. I get it.

346
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:38,607
Don't come near me!

347
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,276
Give me a break.
My boss is watching me.

348
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,237
I got to make it look
like I'm trying to save you.

349
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,073
Come on.

350
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,119
I'm just gonna stand here
and talk to you. That's all.

351
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:54,247
You won't try nothing?

352
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,750
I'm square with you.
I won't try a thing.

353
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,088
You think I want to fall off?
I promise, I'll just talk to you.

354
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:03,799
All right.

355
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:07,761
Here, you want a cigarette?
Come on, let's smoke, okay?

356
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,263
Go on, take it.

357
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,891
Take our time and both die of cancer.

358
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,533
See this key?

359
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,243
Bye-bye!

360
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:33,911
You're crazy!

361
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:38,082
You can jump, but you'd take me
with you, making you a murderer.

362
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,543
- You bastard!
- You'd be killing a cop.

363
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,294
Yeah, a psycho nut cop!

364
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,672
I'm still a cop.
You coming in?

365
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,591
- I'm jumping!
- Do you really wanna jump?

366
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,137
Do you wanna?
That's fine with me. Come on!

367
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,097
Let's do it, asshole.

368
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,932
I want to do it.

369
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,113
Shit!

370
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,163
You want to go up again?

371
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,123
Come on, it was great.

372
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,794
Help me! Help me loose!

373
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,963
He's trying to kill me!

374
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,675
Did you see that?
He's out of his mind! He's crazy!

375
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,136
I want my cuffs back.

376
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:36,473
- Don't you touch me!
- What the fuck did you just do?

377
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,976
I controlled the jump!
You wanted him down? He's down!

378
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,352
Come here!

379
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,354
Come here with me!

380
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,409
Get in here!

381
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:04,167
Okay, no bullshit!
You want to kill yourself?

382
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,628
Shut up! Yes or no?
You want to die?

383
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,047
I got the job done!

384
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,216
Just answer the question!

385
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,343
What do you want to hear, man?

386
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,178
That sometimes I think about
eating a bullet?

387
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,722
Well, I do!

388
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,184
I got a special one for the occasion,
with a hollow point.

389
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,896
Make sure it blows
the back of my goddamn head out!

390
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,399
Every day I wake up and think
of a reason not to do it.

391
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,860
Every single day.

392
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,864
And you know why I don't?
This is gonna make you laugh.

393
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,201
The job. Doing the job.
That's the reason.

394
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,163
- You want to die!
- I don't. I'm not afraid of it.

395
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,459
Here, take my gun. Don't nibble
on the barrel, pull the trigger.

396
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,087
Be my guest!
Go ahead, if you're serious!

397
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,214
You shouldn't tempt me.

398
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,927
In your mouth. Bullet may go
through your ear and not kill you.

399
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,221
Under the chin's just as good!

400
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,240
You're not trying
to draw a psycho pension.

401
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:22,952
You really are crazy.

402
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:31,586
I'm hungry. I'm gonna go
and get something to eat.

403
00:35:42,347 --> 00:35:47,476
I don't know. He's hurting. There's
something eating away at this guy.

404
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:52,106
I think he's on the edge.
I think Riggs has a death wish.

405
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,277
Terrific. So you're
saying I should worry?

406
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,280
I think you should worry.

407
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:01,824
When he goes,
you don't want to be near him.

408
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,952
Thank you, doctor.
You've been very helpful.

409
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,787
You're welcome.

410
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,045
I'm too old for this shit.

411
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:17,965
You hungry?

412
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,966
No! I'm not hungry.

413
00:36:20,509 --> 00:36:22,969
- Want me to drive?
- No! I'll drive!

414
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:24,387
Get in that side!

415
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,972
You drive.

416
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:37,651
You get a bad personal call? What
is it? Did the stock market crash?

417
00:36:38,277 --> 00:36:40,528
Don't worry. Here, have a French fry.

418
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:51,164
Fifty years old. What a birthday.
Fifty years old!

419
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:56,211
Been on the force 20 years, not
a scratch on me. Got a wife, kids...

420
00:36:56,671 --> 00:37:01,549
...house, boat. I can kiss it all
goodbye because of your death wish.

421
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:02,842
My life is over.

422
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,678
Would you just shut up here!

423
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:07,847
Why are you talking to me anyway?
I'm a dead man!

424
00:37:09,558 --> 00:37:13,311
I was driving before you were
an itch in your daddy's pants.

425
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,609
- I didn't know that.
- Know what?

426
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,944
That it was your birthday today.

427
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:24,697
It was yesterday.

428
00:37:25,198 --> 00:37:28,075
Well, happy birthday for yesterday.

429
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:33,372
Sincerely. Happy birthday, man.

430
00:37:33,581 --> 00:37:34,707
Thanks.

431
00:37:37,377 --> 00:37:41,213
Maybe we'll stay alive long enough
for me to buy you a present.

432
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,217
Don't thank me now.

433
00:37:45,552 --> 00:37:49,555
It's the least I can do after
all the kindness you've shown me.

434
00:38:02,152 --> 00:38:04,778
Are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

435
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:06,989
Are we together on this?

436
00:38:08,116 --> 00:38:12,494
Beverly Hills. We got an address
on Amanda Hunsaker's meal ticket.

437
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:15,164
Remember, he's not a suspect yet.

438
00:38:15,498 --> 00:38:17,916
So we question him, not damage him.

439
00:38:18,126 --> 00:38:20,669
I won't hurt. You do all the talking.

440
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:22,378
Let me do all the talking.

441
00:38:22,588 --> 00:38:24,589
Experience counts here.

442
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:30,261
- You're not going to smoke in the car.
- Well, I am.

443
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:35,099
- What? Does this bother you?
- It bothers me.

444
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:36,684
- Does it?
- Yeah.

445
00:38:38,437 --> 00:38:39,937
I'll open a window.

446
00:38:40,314 --> 00:38:45,276
That's not the point. I have to watch
out for my lungs, take care of myself.

447
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:48,446
4241 coming up.

448
00:38:48,697 --> 00:38:50,114
Bingo.

449
00:38:51,283 --> 00:38:55,286
- Do we have a warrant?
- We don't need one with the gate club.

450
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:57,789
Didn't take them long, huh?

451
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:04,670
Hey, guys, go on in!
Make yourselves at home!

452
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,297
Merry Christmas!

453
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:11,177
Don't need a warrant with an invitation.

454
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,391
I saw this place on
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless."

455
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:27,692
Get the door.

456
00:39:39,622 --> 00:39:41,623
Nice and easy.

457
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,754
- Looks like the Garden of Eden.
- Look at this!

458
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,507
Paradise.

459
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:55,512
Isn't that sweet?

460
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:58,098
I'm thinking probable cause.

461
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:12,237
Get the girls!

462
00:40:13,531 --> 00:40:14,990
Okay, asshole!

463
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:17,325
Move! Come on! Get out!

464
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:19,369
Fast! Move!

465
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:23,372
Get your hands on that tree
and face each other!

466
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,291
Hands in front of you!

467
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:28,627
- My leg...
- Don't move it, or I'll break your arm.

468
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:30,838
Got them!

469
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:35,509
Show me your hands!

470
00:40:35,886 --> 00:40:37,344
Right now!

471
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:39,805
Put your hands out there!

472
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:46,020
See how easy that was?

473
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:49,773
Boom! Still alive.
Now we question him. You know why?

474
00:40:50,066 --> 00:40:53,402
Because I didn't shoot him
or jump off a building with him.

475
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,070
The building guy lived.

476
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,906
The point being, no killing.

477
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:59,366
- No killing, right.
- Right.

478
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:01,577
Piece of cake. Now I'm happy.

479
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,538
Read him his rights.
I'll stand here being happy.

480
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,167
He's got a gun!

481
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:54,587
You ever met anybody you didn't kill?

482
00:41:57,758 --> 00:42:00,093
Well, I haven't killed you yet.

483
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:04,097
Don't do me no favors.

484
00:42:04,473 --> 00:42:05,974
Don't you worry.

485
00:42:17,987 --> 00:42:21,656
The coroner gave the body
a ride downtown.

486
00:42:23,784 --> 00:42:25,784
I guess we can get out of here.

487
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:33,292
I'm sorry about that shit
I said out there.

488
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:37,963
You saved my life. Thank you.

489
00:42:44,304 --> 00:42:45,762
I bet that hurt to say.

490
00:42:48,308 --> 00:42:49,516
You'll never know.

491
00:42:51,644 --> 00:42:53,103
Let's get a bite to eat.

492
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:54,688
Get my shoes on.

493
00:43:05,658 --> 00:43:08,410
- Mom, Rog is coming.
- Okay, Carrie.

494
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:21,548
Here's my welcoming committee!
Where's my daughter? Which one...?

495
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:25,177
- Come on, Daddy.
- This one's my daughter!

496
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:28,346
Home, both of you. Dinnertime.

497
00:43:29,014 --> 00:43:30,348
How are you doing?

498
00:43:30,682 --> 00:43:32,224
I am doing all right.

499
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:34,226
Is that a crook?

500
00:43:34,686 --> 00:43:37,229
No, this is my new partner, Martin.

501
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:43,361
I'm glad you're home at a sensible hour.

502
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,364
Well, I try to be a sensible dad.

503
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,366
Come on in, Martin.

504
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:51,202
Yeah, close the door.

505
00:43:51,745 --> 00:43:55,748
Hello, Nick. Get your legs
off the arm of the couch.

506
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:01,420
How you doing? Is Mommy
in the kitchen? Let's sneak up on her.

507
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:09,595
Hello, baby!
I want you to meet...

508
00:44:09,888 --> 00:44:12,682
I'd like you to meet
Daddy's new partner.

509
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,517
- Martin Riggs.
- How are you?

510
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:17,728
- This is my wife, Trish.
- Pleased to meet you.

511
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:20,106
Martin's going to join us for dinner.

512
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:23,067
- Roast okay with you?
- What's for dinner?

513
00:44:23,735 --> 00:44:26,070
We'll see what's for dinner.

514
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:29,739
This is a brown, sticky...

515
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:31,616
It's roast.

516
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:34,285
How about a brown, roast-like substance?

517
00:44:34,537 --> 00:44:37,414
- Roger, you're being an asshole.
- I try not to be.

518
00:44:37,748 --> 00:44:39,499
- Want a drink?
- What do you got?

519
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:41,793
We have Canadian Mist...

520
00:44:42,628 --> 00:44:46,214
- You like Canadian Mist?
- Honey, it's in the back.

521
00:44:48,426 --> 00:44:51,761
How come we didn't have fish?
I thought we had fish tonight.

522
00:44:52,096 --> 00:44:53,638
Don't worry about the fish.

523
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:55,932
Getting defensive...
Ever go fishing?

524
00:44:56,225 --> 00:44:59,144
Not since I was a kid.
I used to go spearfishing.

525
00:45:01,105 --> 00:45:02,480
All I caught was a cold.

526
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:06,568
I got that boat out there.

527
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:08,903
Rianne, get the dessert.

528
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,490
Rianne! Your mother said
get the dessert.

529
00:45:12,658 --> 00:45:15,034
- Get the dessert. Get to it!
- Shut up.

530
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,623
Catalina Island. Nothing exciting,
but I catch my allotment.

531
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,336
You can catch a few things out there.
I caught my wife out there.

532
00:45:26,922 --> 00:45:28,548
Nice fishing out there.

533
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:30,299
Mr. Riggs, care for a tart?

534
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:32,509
Thank you, yes. Call me Martin.

535
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:36,013
Mr. Riggs.

536
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:37,639
Sit down.

537
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,602
Rianne, it's not the first time
we've had company.

538
00:45:47,317 --> 00:45:51,153
My name is Carrie, I'm no fairy
My sister's cherry

539
00:45:51,488 --> 00:45:53,822
She's in love with a guy
named Martin...

540
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,200
Nicholas!

541
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:58,994
Come on. It was really good!

542
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,663
Yeah, Dad! Why don't you try it?

543
00:46:02,123 --> 00:46:03,123
It was good.

544
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,211
Yeah, there you go.

545
00:46:07,504 --> 00:46:09,963
I'm gonna find a partner
My name is Roger

546
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,884
And I need to be modger
And a secret hodger

547
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,136
You need some help.

548
00:46:16,387 --> 00:46:17,846
I am awful!

549
00:46:32,027 --> 00:46:35,738
Hey, sarge! Thanks for
taking out the garbage.

550
00:46:36,365 --> 00:46:39,200
But, honey, I'm entertaining our guest.

551
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,205
What do you think?

552
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:47,667
It's nice. You know
anything about boats?

553
00:46:47,918 --> 00:46:50,586
- I know what they cost.
- Can you sail this?

554
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:53,840
What's wrong with you?
It's not a sailboat.

555
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:55,883
That's what I thought.

556
00:46:56,218 --> 00:47:01,055
There's no trick. That's the front,
that's the back, water all around.

557
00:47:01,348 --> 00:47:04,016
Why you gotta make things
so complicated?

558
00:47:08,063 --> 00:47:11,858
I don't. Things get complicated
all by themselves.

559
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:14,527
You mean
Amanda Hunsaker's murder, huh?

560
00:47:14,778 --> 00:47:16,779
Did I mention that? I didn't.

561
00:47:17,906 --> 00:47:19,907
Didn't have to.
I can read your mind.

562
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,911
What's the matter with you?

563
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,789
- Why is there a problem?
- There's no problem.

564
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,250
You got one dead girl
and one dead guy.

565
00:47:29,459 --> 00:47:33,920
The guy kills the girl. We kill him
because he wants us to be dead guys.

566
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:36,047
That's easy for you to say.

567
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:39,301
A sugar daddy is dealing drugs.

568
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:43,096
She said, did or saw something
she wasn't supposed to.

569
00:47:43,306 --> 00:47:46,600
He pitches her off the balcony
into the sweet by-and-by.

570
00:47:47,685 --> 00:47:49,978
That's why he came at us
with a shotgun today.

571
00:47:50,187 --> 00:47:54,274
I'm sorry. It's just a little too neat.
I can't swallow it.

572
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:58,570
Of course it's neat.
What's wrong with neat? I like neat.

573
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:02,324
By neat, you mean simple.

574
00:48:04,952 --> 00:48:06,620
- You okay?
- Watch out!

575
00:48:07,288 --> 00:48:08,788
What button did you push?

576
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:11,666
Where's my manual?

577
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:15,420
Is this what you're
looking for, captain?

578
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:16,963
You asshole!

579
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:21,635
Didn't mean to interrupt one of those
intellectual conversations...

580
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,763
Mark asked me to a club tomorrow night.

581
00:48:25,014 --> 00:48:28,141
- You're grounded. You know that.
- Please, Daddy?

582
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:29,476
Which one is Mark?

583
00:48:29,727 --> 00:48:32,103
- The blond one.
- With pits in his face?

584
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:34,021
Those are dimples.

585
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,233
Pits. When he smiles, I can see
through his head. The answer is no.

586
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:40,027
Have a heart, Rog.

587
00:48:40,236 --> 00:48:43,781
Hey, buddy. She smoked pot
in the house. She's grounded.

588
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:47,743
Why can I have a beer
and I can't smoke a joint?

589
00:48:47,953 --> 00:48:49,244
It's not coke, you know.

590
00:48:49,454 --> 00:48:53,332
I'll tell you why.
Because now, at this moment...

591
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:56,835
...beer is legal, grass ain't.
Right or wrong?

592
00:48:57,253 --> 00:48:59,296
- It's wrong.
- Right.

593
00:49:05,387 --> 00:49:08,263
They sit there drinking six-packs
and I get grounded.

594
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:11,475
I'm gonna go home.

595
00:49:12,185 --> 00:49:14,561
Did we resolve anything here tonight?

596
00:49:14,813 --> 00:49:16,730
Yeah, we resolved plenty.

597
00:49:17,899 --> 00:49:20,317
We know your wife
takes out the garbage...

598
00:49:20,652 --> 00:49:23,320
...your daughter smokes grass
and it's illegal...

599
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:27,533
...and you don't know
a lot about boats.

600
00:49:31,913 --> 00:49:34,330
You got a hell of a nice family there.

601
00:49:34,581 --> 00:49:35,665
Thank you.

602
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,543
I enjoyed the meal. Thanks a lot.

603
00:49:38,752 --> 00:49:42,046
Bullshit. But thanks anyway.

604
00:49:48,345 --> 00:49:50,179
You don't trust me at all, do you?

605
00:49:51,598 --> 00:49:56,394
I tell you what. You make it through
tomorrow without killing anybody...

606
00:49:56,603 --> 00:50:00,565
...especially me or yourself,
then I'll start trusting you.

607
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,235
Fair enough.

608
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:10,825
I do it real good, you know.

609
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,452
Do what?

610
00:50:15,706 --> 00:50:19,917
When I was 19, I did a guy
in Laos from 1000 yards out.

611
00:50:20,377 --> 00:50:22,587
A rifle shot in high wind.

612
00:50:25,049 --> 00:50:26,549
Maybe eight...

613
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:30,261
...or even ten guys in the world
could have made that shot.

614
00:50:34,808 --> 00:50:37,392
It's the only thing I was ever good at.

615
00:50:39,979 --> 00:50:41,104
See you tomorrow.

616
00:50:42,982 --> 00:50:44,649
Yeah, see you.

617
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:53,658
You really like my wife's cooking?

618
00:51:00,249 --> 00:51:01,249
No.

619
00:51:02,418 --> 00:51:03,668
See you tomorrow.

620
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:31,113
Get out of there, Burbank.

621
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:52,675
This is cute.

622
00:51:56,471 --> 00:51:59,140
What have we got here?
"Police evidence."

623
00:53:37,112 --> 00:53:39,738
Morning, Roger.
Here, have some coffee.

624
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:45,077
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the night Amanda Hunsaker died.

625
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:47,246
- How did you get in?
- Trish let me in.

626
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:49,456
- What time is it?
- Daytime.

627
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:52,584
The night Amanda Hunsaker died, she...

628
00:53:53,086 --> 00:53:56,088
What was the name of that hooker
who witnessed the jump?

629
00:53:56,297 --> 00:53:59,800
Come on, we got to get up
and catch bad guys today.

630
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:01,593
I'll get a shower.

631
00:54:01,844 --> 00:54:04,638
What was the name of that hooker?

632
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:08,183
- Century City isn't her usual turf.
- Her name is Dixie!

633
00:54:08,434 --> 00:54:12,271
Give me that cup.
And get out of here!

634
00:54:16,609 --> 00:54:19,653
Someone was in bed with Amanda
the night she died.

635
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:22,114
Until now, we assumed it was a man.

636
00:54:22,448 --> 00:54:24,116
Suppose it was Dixie.

637
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:28,578
Disgusting, but okay. Let's say Dixie
put the drain cleaner in her pills.

638
00:54:28,788 --> 00:54:30,289
Say someone paid her.

639
00:54:30,498 --> 00:54:35,377
She thinks, "Amanda swallows a couple
downers and she's dead." Then Dixie...

640
00:54:35,795 --> 00:54:36,920
If it was her.

641
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:42,216
If it was her. She's got plenty of time
to spritz the place up and get out.

642
00:54:42,384 --> 00:54:44,468
But Amanda jumps out the window.

643
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:46,679
Or Dixie pushes her.

644
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:49,849
She has to make a quick exit
because the body's public.

645
00:54:50,058 --> 00:54:51,600
So she hauls ass downstairs.

646
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,811
People are saying, "What happened?"

647
00:54:54,062 --> 00:54:56,397
Somebody spots her,
and she says, "Shit!"

648
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:58,899
That's right, she says, "Shit!"

649
00:54:59,192 --> 00:55:02,194
The point being that now
she has to cover her ass.

650
00:55:04,156 --> 00:55:08,826
So she grabs a flatfoot and says,
"Officer, I saw the whole thing."

651
00:55:10,162 --> 00:55:11,495
Right.

652
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:16,917
That's pretty fucking thin.

653
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:18,419
That's very thin.

654
00:55:18,754 --> 00:55:20,421
Thin's my middle name.

655
00:55:20,672 --> 00:55:23,090
Your wife's cooking, I'm not surprised.

656
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:26,093
- What?
- Nothing.

657
00:55:26,428 --> 00:55:29,180
Those remarks won't get you
invited to Christmas dinner.

658
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:32,933
My luck's changing
for the better every day.

659
00:55:35,187 --> 00:55:37,688
All right, baby, come to Roger.

660
00:55:40,025 --> 00:55:41,524
Center mass.

661
00:55:47,698 --> 00:55:49,574
Read them and weep.

662
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:55,080
Do you sleep with that thing?

663
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:57,123
I would if I slept.

664
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:00,627
Step back. Let me show
what an old man can do.

665
00:56:01,545 --> 00:56:03,755
Just warming up,
just warming up.

666
00:56:11,389 --> 00:56:12,972
Watch carefully.

667
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:30,073
Hey! Look at that, will you?
Not bad for an old man.

668
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:32,742
Step aside, old man.

669
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:30,716
Have a nice day.

670
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:37,848
Shit!

671
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:44,228
The policemen are here!

672
00:57:44,897 --> 00:57:48,232
Yeah, you're right.
Hello, policemen!

673
00:57:53,405 --> 00:57:55,323
- How you doing?
- Fine.

674
00:57:55,532 --> 00:57:58,201
Are you going to bust Dixie?

675
00:57:58,452 --> 00:58:01,245
We're just going over there
for a cup of coffee.

676
00:58:01,455 --> 00:58:03,623
We're going over here to have breakfast.

677
00:58:03,874 --> 00:58:08,836
You're gonna bust Dixie!

678
00:58:14,218 --> 00:58:17,386
- Like I said, thin.
- Probably nothing.

679
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:32,777
Did you see that? Wasn't that great?

680
00:58:36,448 --> 00:58:37,949
What are you, a fag?

681
00:58:38,158 --> 00:58:39,867
Your coat's on fire!

682
00:58:44,248 --> 00:58:47,582
- Probably nothing.
- Thin. Very thin.

683
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:52,587
You guys okay? Got all
your fingers and toes?

684
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:54,965
Three William 56.

685
00:58:55,258 --> 00:58:58,176
We got a fire and explosion
at 111th and Larch.

686
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:01,346
Request ambulance and fire department.

687
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:04,140
Do it again! Do it again!

688
00:59:04,475 --> 00:59:07,352
- Give me a break, guys.
- Enough, enough!

689
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,896
Do you think Dixie was home?

690
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,325
What you got?

691
00:59:23,536 --> 00:59:24,911
Part of the device.

692
00:59:25,204 --> 00:59:27,664
This is artwork.
This is goddamn artwork.

693
00:59:27,873 --> 00:59:33,003
This is real pro stuff. I haven't seen
anything like this since the war.

694
00:59:34,463 --> 00:59:37,841
The CIA used to hire mercs.
They used the exact same setup.

695
00:59:38,092 --> 00:59:41,011
Mercury switches, gaflooey!
That's heavy shit.

696
00:59:42,597 --> 00:59:45,557
We got something.
The detective wants to see you.

697
00:59:55,734 --> 00:59:56,817
Okay, here it is.

698
00:59:57,068 --> 00:59:58,819
Some kids playing this morning...

699
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:01,155
...one saw a guy checking the meter.

700
01:00:01,406 --> 01:00:03,532
- Where?
- Here at Dixie's.

701
01:00:03,783 --> 01:00:08,120
He was playing under the porch.
Says he saw the guy pretty good.

702
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,832
- It could be a break.
- Those kids are six years old.

703
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,543
- You call the gas company?
- Sure did.

704
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:18,505
No one's supposed to check
that meter for at least a month.

705
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:22,926
- Let me handle this.
- Be my guest.

706
01:00:23,136 --> 01:00:25,596
He's the little fellow that saw the guy.

707
01:00:26,598 --> 01:00:29,600
My name is Detective Murtaugh.
What's yours?

708
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:33,145
- Don't tell him your name.
- He'll put you in jail.

709
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,647
You won't see your mom.

710
01:00:34,939 --> 01:00:38,776
It's all right. I won't
put you in jail. What's your name?

711
01:00:38,985 --> 01:00:42,112
- Don't tell him, Alfred.
- Alfred!

712
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:45,908
This is Alfred! Hey, meet Alfred.
This is Alfred.

713
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:48,785
Alfred, hi! How old are you?

714
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:50,328
Six.

715
01:00:50,704 --> 01:00:54,332
Six years old. I bet you like Go-Bots.

716
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:55,958
Is that a real gun?

717
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:58,378
Yeah, this is a real gun.

718
01:00:58,837 --> 01:01:00,004
Do you kill people?

719
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:04,592
No. If some guy is hurting someone,
I try to shoot him in the leg...

720
01:01:04,843 --> 01:01:06,219
...just to stop him.

721
01:01:06,428 --> 01:01:08,971
Mama says policemen shoot black people.

722
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:11,140
- Is it true?
- Yeah, is it true?

723
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,142
Is that true?

724
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:18,022
Maybe we ought to get
the kids some...

725
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,607
Ice cream.

726
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:21,109
You like ice cream?

727
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:30,243
No, not you, Alfred.

728
01:01:34,456 --> 01:01:37,792
The man you saw,
did you get a good look at him?

729
01:01:38,043 --> 01:01:40,336
- I saw him.
- Great!

730
01:01:41,004 --> 01:01:45,258
Picture him in your head.
Close your eyes.

731
01:01:45,843 --> 01:01:48,094
Think what he looks like.

732
01:01:48,428 --> 01:01:49,553
Got it?

733
01:01:50,012 --> 01:01:51,471
Can you draw him?

734
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:55,976
Give me some drawing paper
and crayons.

735
01:01:56,436 --> 01:01:58,729
- This is good.
- Can it, man.

736
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,314
We're gonna put out
an APB on Big Bird.

737
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:04,484
"All units. Large
yellow bird, silly voice."

738
01:02:04,861 --> 01:02:07,696
You're hilarious, Martin. It's enough.

739
01:02:07,905 --> 01:02:09,656
Tell me what he looks like.

740
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:11,950
Was he black?

741
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:14,202
Was he white?

742
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:19,082
Was he tall?

743
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:20,959
Tall like me?

744
01:02:21,169 --> 01:02:23,253
What color was his hair? Brown?

745
01:02:24,505 --> 01:02:25,964
Black?

746
01:02:26,507 --> 01:02:27,966
Blond?

747
01:02:28,176 --> 01:02:29,676
His hair was blond.

748
01:02:30,803 --> 01:02:34,222
What did he have on?
Did he have jeans on?

749
01:02:34,432 --> 01:02:35,682
It was paint.

750
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:37,184
Pained?

751
01:02:37,852 --> 01:02:38,852
I don't know.

752
01:02:41,314 --> 01:02:42,314
Painted?

753
01:02:43,649 --> 01:02:45,525
Painted. A tattoo?

754
01:02:47,153 --> 01:02:50,446
Like Popeye?
A tattoo like Popeye? No?

755
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:52,698
It was that.

756
01:02:55,202 --> 01:02:56,660
Like that?

757
01:02:57,329 --> 01:02:58,829
Exactly like that?

758
01:03:00,499 --> 01:03:02,792
I saw it good. This is it.

759
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:04,376
I remember.

760
01:03:04,836 --> 01:03:06,128
Are you sure?

761
01:03:06,671 --> 01:03:07,963
It had a knife, even.

762
01:03:19,518 --> 01:03:22,520
Roger, that's a Special Forces tattoo.

763
01:03:23,355 --> 01:03:24,522
Really?

764
01:03:26,233 --> 01:03:29,693
A Special Forces tattoo,
mercury switches...

765
01:03:33,698 --> 01:03:36,283
What the hell
have we gotten into here?

766
01:03:39,204 --> 01:03:42,540
Wonder if there's an opening
in the fire department?

767
01:03:52,758 --> 01:03:53,967
Want to tell me about it?

768
01:03:54,426 --> 01:03:56,803
- About what?
- Don't bullshit me.

769
01:03:57,054 --> 01:04:00,473
Your daughter wasn't killed
for something she was into.

770
01:04:00,724 --> 01:04:02,934
She was killed
for something you're into.

771
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:05,895
Stop me if I'm wrong.

772
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:09,274
I don't know what you mean.

773
01:04:10,442 --> 01:04:13,403
Keep your hands
away from your pocket, okay?

774
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:15,905
- Easy, man.
- Fuck easy.

775
01:04:18,951 --> 01:04:22,370
You called me the other day
to blow the whistle, right?

776
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,664
Blow the whistle on what?

777
01:04:24,874 --> 01:04:28,167
You were going to tell all,
so they killed your daughter.

778
01:04:28,419 --> 01:04:31,087
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Talk to me!

779
01:04:31,422 --> 01:04:33,590
They killed your daughter.

780
01:04:33,883 --> 01:04:36,968
They paid off a hooker to poison
your little girl.

781
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:39,262
Chrissake!
I've got another daughter.

782
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:42,807
- She'll be protected.
- You don't know these people.

783
01:04:43,309 --> 01:04:45,101
Acquaint me with them.

784
01:04:48,647 --> 01:04:50,356
It goes back to the war.

785
01:04:53,568 --> 01:04:57,821
I worked with a group called
"Air America." CIA front.

786
01:05:00,116 --> 01:05:02,743
They secretly ran
the entire war out of Laos.

787
01:05:03,453 --> 01:05:07,623
I was with a special unit called
"Shadow Company." Trained killers.

788
01:05:07,957 --> 01:05:11,460
When Charlie brought in heroin
to finance the VC government...

789
01:05:11,711 --> 01:05:14,504
...Shadow Company burned
the whole thing down.

790
01:05:14,964 --> 01:05:16,798
We killed everybody.

791
01:05:21,846 --> 01:05:23,597
We also formed a plan.

792
01:05:24,015 --> 01:05:25,140
Keep talking.

793
01:05:31,356 --> 01:05:34,733
A few years ago, Shadow Company
got together again.

794
01:05:35,151 --> 01:05:36,818
The war was over.

795
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,447
But we still had our sources in Asia.

796
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:43,742
We've been bringing it in
ever since.

797
01:05:44,118 --> 01:05:45,410
Bringing in what?

798
01:05:46,496 --> 01:05:47,871
Heroin.

799
01:05:48,331 --> 01:05:50,582
Two major shipments a year.

800
01:05:54,002 --> 01:05:56,379
It's all run by ex-CIA.

801
01:05:57,172 --> 01:05:59,173
Soldiers, mercs.

802
01:06:00,008 --> 01:06:02,093
You son of a bitch!

803
01:06:02,302 --> 01:06:06,222
If you had cold feet, why did
they kill Amanda? Why not you?

804
01:06:06,431 --> 01:06:08,849
- They can't. They need me.
- Why?

805
01:06:09,101 --> 01:06:14,146
My company is a perfect front. Makes
everything look great on tax reports.

806
01:06:17,859 --> 01:06:20,194
This is big business, Roger.

807
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:26,575
Not anymore.

808
01:06:27,703 --> 01:06:29,704
I'm gonna burn it down.

809
01:06:29,913 --> 01:06:31,747
You can't. It's too big.

810
01:06:32,332 --> 01:06:35,334
These people are trained,
expert killers.

811
01:06:35,836 --> 01:06:39,964
Tell me about your next shipment:
Where it's coming in, how many...

812
01:06:40,173 --> 01:06:42,883
I can't tell you that, Roger.
I can't.

813
01:06:43,552 --> 01:06:48,180
I have another daughter. You can't
protect her. I'm in this too deep.

814
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:11,077
Heroin.
You got off easy, you son of a bitch!

815
01:07:31,766 --> 01:07:32,932
You through?

816
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:35,101
I haven't even started.

817
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:39,939
Gen. McAllister, this is Delta One.
We're coming in. Over.

818
01:07:40,649 --> 01:07:43,068
- So your mission is accomplished?
- Yes, sir.

819
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:45,487
Mr. Hunsaker is dead, sir.

820
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,656
I'm afraid, however,
that another problem exists.

821
01:07:48,908 --> 01:07:50,492
What is it? Explain.

822
01:07:50,743 --> 01:07:52,744
Hunsaker spoke to the police.

823
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:56,330
- Are they dead?
- No, I missed the opportunity.

824
01:07:56,581 --> 01:08:00,459
Very disappointing. So the police
may know the whole operation?

825
01:08:00,668 --> 01:08:02,336
That is correct, sir.

826
01:08:02,962 --> 01:08:05,339
Joshua, it's time
we turned up the heat.

827
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:07,007
Come on home.

828
01:08:25,318 --> 01:08:28,237
What's a nice Irish girl
like you doing out here?

829
01:08:28,446 --> 01:08:31,532
I'm looking for a guy,
had this girl in his stable.

830
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:34,827
- Never seen her.
- She's in your line of work. You sure?

831
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,621
- Sure. Why?
- I'm a police officer.

832
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:40,499
Don't worry, I won't drag your
ass to jail...

833
01:09:08,026 --> 01:09:09,402
You wore your vest!

834
01:09:10,487 --> 01:09:12,822
That was smart, kid. Come on.

835
01:09:15,033 --> 01:09:17,368
Hold on! I'm on your side.

836
01:09:20,038 --> 01:09:22,456
Son of a bitch, that hurts!

837
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:25,585
I'm pissed, Roger! Now I'm pissed.

838
01:09:27,421 --> 01:09:28,838
Look at your face!

839
01:09:29,173 --> 01:09:31,299
Two inches higher,
he'd have hit your head.

840
01:09:31,508 --> 01:09:34,093
Two inches lower,
I'd be a falsetto for life.

841
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,220
I bet you'd sound nice too.

842
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:39,974
- Where's my gun?
- Here.

843
01:09:43,061 --> 01:09:44,770
Oh, shit! Roger!

844
01:09:45,606 --> 01:09:47,648
The guy who shot me...

845
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:51,819
The same albino jackrabbit
son of a bitch that did Hunsaker.

846
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:53,738
- You sure?
- I'm sure, man.

847
01:09:53,906 --> 01:09:55,865
I never forget an asshole.

848
01:09:56,116 --> 01:09:57,782
I got an idea.

849
01:09:58,534 --> 01:10:02,162
We fly first class to Detroit
and lay low for a couple weeks.

850
01:10:02,371 --> 01:10:04,748
Come on, be serious.
What do we do?

851
01:10:04,957 --> 01:10:06,082
What else?

852
01:10:06,334 --> 01:10:09,002
We bury the fuckers.
And you know what else?

853
01:10:09,212 --> 01:10:13,340
We do this right, we get famous.
Do shaving ads. Girls. Money.

854
01:10:14,133 --> 01:10:16,801
With our luck, we'll do
Forest Lawn commercials.

855
01:10:17,011 --> 01:10:19,304
Bullshit! We got the edge.

856
01:10:20,389 --> 01:10:24,017
Roger, they think I'm dead.
I'm a corpse.

857
01:10:30,274 --> 01:10:31,691
Brilliant.

858
01:10:33,736 --> 01:10:35,487
Brilliant shit!

859
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:40,158
We got a body for you.

860
01:10:40,409 --> 01:10:43,954
He was at Hunsaker's place.
I saw him, he saw me.

861
01:10:44,163 --> 01:10:46,164
Get someone else to do it, okay?

862
01:10:46,499 --> 01:10:50,627
Captain says give it to you.
About two blocks from your house.

863
01:10:51,128 --> 01:10:54,839
Yeah, sure. He's probably blond
with big dimples.

864
01:10:55,174 --> 01:10:57,509
How did you know that, sarge?

865
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:00,302
Get in here!

866
01:11:01,805 --> 01:11:02,846
Trouble.

867
01:11:06,184 --> 01:11:10,062
They just gave a description
of the kid my daughter's dating.

868
01:11:37,549 --> 01:11:39,717
Let's be dark and quiet.

869
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,259
The bastards got my daughter.

870
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:35,772
What is it?

871
01:12:36,273 --> 01:12:37,273
Nothing.

872
01:12:37,483 --> 01:12:39,025
- What is it?!
- Nothing!

873
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:42,028
Get back in your room.
Back in your room!

874
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:01,296
You have a beautiful daughter.

875
01:13:01,506 --> 01:13:04,966
I'd stick by the phone to find out
Where to meet us.

876
01:13:10,973 --> 01:13:12,724
They got my kid.

877
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,561
Bastards took my baby.

878
01:13:40,044 --> 01:13:42,671
Sgt. McCaskey, pick up line three.

879
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:45,257
Homicide, McCaskey speaking.

880
01:13:45,466 --> 01:13:46,800
This is KCOP news.

881
01:13:47,009 --> 01:13:51,388
We heard an officer was shot tonight.
Can you give us more information?

882
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:55,392
Sgt. Martin Riggs was shot and killed.
Who is this?

883
01:13:55,601 --> 01:13:57,561
We'll send somebody right over.

884
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:04,608
Bingo! Riggs is out of the picture.

885
01:14:05,026 --> 01:14:06,777
I want Murtaugh taken alive.

886
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,779
He may not talk.

887
01:14:10,031 --> 01:14:11,949
We have his little girl.
He'll talk.

888
01:14:28,049 --> 01:14:30,885
You know they're gonna kill her,
don't you?

889
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:38,601
And if you want her back,
you'll have to take her away from them.

890
01:14:38,935 --> 01:14:40,227
I know.

891
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:49,570
We do this my way.
You shoot and you shoot to kill.

892
01:14:50,071 --> 01:14:54,533
Get as many as you can.
All you got to do is just not miss.

893
01:14:54,743 --> 01:14:56,285
I won't miss.

894
01:14:58,288 --> 01:15:01,207
We're going to get bloody on this one.

895
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:07,086
Are you really crazy?

896
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,133
Or are you as good
as you say you are?

897
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:16,137
You're gonna have to trust me.

898
01:15:20,142 --> 01:15:21,476
Here we go.

899
01:15:28,192 --> 01:15:32,445
We don't want your daughter.
We want to know what Hunsaker told you.

900
01:15:32,655 --> 01:15:36,699
Dry lake. Victorville.
Sunrise tomorroW. Be there.

901
01:18:41,924 --> 01:18:43,258
Murtaugh!

902
01:18:43,884 --> 01:18:45,301
Yes, that's right.

903
01:18:45,553 --> 01:18:47,512
Show me my daughter!

904
01:18:47,805 --> 01:18:50,640
Let me see her, then I'll come quietly.

905
01:18:57,648 --> 01:18:59,315
He wants to see the girl.

906
01:18:59,525 --> 01:19:00,775
Get out.

907
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:07,657
Daddy!

908
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,492
Okay, baby! I'm here.

909
01:19:10,994 --> 01:19:12,911
Okay, it's all right.

910
01:19:13,163 --> 01:19:14,163
Simple exchange.

911
01:19:15,165 --> 01:19:18,751
You come with us,
the girl takes a walk.

912
01:19:19,002 --> 01:19:20,461
Let her go now.

913
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:26,300
As I say, take your hands
out of your pockets.

914
01:19:26,509 --> 01:19:28,177
Sure thing, pal.

915
01:19:32,015 --> 01:19:33,015
It's alive.

916
01:19:35,518 --> 01:19:38,145
Let her go now, or we all die.

917
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,063
Take him!

918
01:19:40,398 --> 01:19:41,648
He has a grenade!

919
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,860
He's bluffing!
He wouldn't risk killing his daughter.

920
01:19:45,653 --> 01:19:47,196
If she's gonna die...

921
01:19:47,447 --> 01:19:50,866
...she's gonna die with me.
My way, not yours.

922
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:00,417
Come on, Roger, get out of the way.
Move to your left. Come on!

923
01:20:00,668 --> 01:20:02,127
Put the pin back in.

924
01:20:02,629 --> 01:20:06,465
Officer Murtaugh, don't be foolish.
Look at the hardware.

925
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,425
Move to your left.

926
01:20:14,097 --> 01:20:17,600
Look at the firepower.
You're grounded. Riggs is gone.

927
01:20:17,976 --> 01:20:20,144
Put the pin back in the grenade.

928
01:20:20,354 --> 01:20:21,938
If you come closer...

929
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:23,731
...then we all die.

930
01:20:25,275 --> 01:20:26,943
I don't think so.

931
01:20:34,952 --> 01:20:36,744
Come on, honey.

932
01:20:38,831 --> 01:20:39,831
Just a smoker.

933
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:41,290
Bingo.

934
01:20:46,463 --> 01:20:48,381
- Where is he?
- It's Riggs.

935
01:20:50,801 --> 01:20:53,135
Rianne, get in the car!

936
01:20:54,805 --> 01:20:56,514
Get in the fucking car!

937
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:15,991
Go, Rianne, go!

938
01:21:16,325 --> 01:21:19,077
Come on, cottontail,
stick your head up.

939
01:21:20,538 --> 01:21:23,039
That's it, you son of a bitch.
Good night.

940
01:21:26,711 --> 01:21:29,421
Don't try it, son.
You're not that fast.

941
01:21:31,424 --> 01:21:33,258
Hello, Joshua. Hello, Joshua.

942
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:35,218
- Yes, sir.
- I got Riggs.

943
01:21:36,012 --> 01:21:38,722
He's got Riggs. Go get the girl!

944
01:22:14,132 --> 01:22:16,133
Throw your weapon down!

945
01:22:16,384 --> 01:22:18,719
Put your hands behind your head!

946
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:26,477
You're Gen. Peter McAllister,
commander of Shadow Company.

947
01:22:26,895 --> 01:22:29,563
I see we've heard of each other.

948
01:22:29,773 --> 01:22:33,317
Yep. It'll almost be a shame
when I nail you.

949
01:22:34,235 --> 01:22:38,572
I ran into some of those Shadow Company
pussies in Saigon in '69.

950
01:22:38,865 --> 01:22:40,157
You did, did you?

951
01:23:27,287 --> 01:23:29,122
Leave me alone!

952
01:23:55,858 --> 01:23:58,151
Save your strength.
You'll need it.

953
01:23:58,569 --> 01:23:59,569
Who's the Chin?

954
01:24:00,738 --> 01:24:03,322
Endo, meet Mr. Martin Riggs.

955
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:07,410
Endo has forgotten more
about dispensing pain...

956
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:08,870
...than we'll ever know.

957
01:24:10,748 --> 01:24:12,498
See, we have a problem.

958
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:14,499
Since we have Murtaugh...

959
01:24:15,043 --> 01:24:16,334
...we don't need you.

960
01:24:16,669 --> 01:24:20,047
- I believe in being thorough.
- I've heard that about you.

961
01:24:22,258 --> 01:24:24,926
Our problem, and yours too...

962
01:24:25,678 --> 01:24:28,680
...is we have a shipment
of merchandise to deliver.

963
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:30,766
Why don't you just call it heroin?

964
01:24:32,435 --> 01:24:34,811
It's rather large, this shipment.

965
01:24:35,772 --> 01:24:37,689
It would be unfortunate...

966
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:40,650
...if we showed up
to deliver our heroin...

967
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:43,070
...and were surrounded by 50 cops.

968
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:44,488
That would be too bad.

969
01:24:44,739 --> 01:24:46,281
Yes, it would be.

970
01:24:47,241 --> 01:24:50,160
So we have to find out
all the cops know.

971
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:53,330
We don't know shit.
You did Hunsaker before he could say...

972
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:59,252
I wish I could believe you.
Unfortunately, I don't.

973
01:25:04,383 --> 01:25:07,260
Now, if you tell me
everything you know...

974
01:25:07,512 --> 01:25:09,805
...I promise you I'll kill you quick.

975
01:25:11,974 --> 01:25:13,725
I told you everything I know.

976
01:25:20,899 --> 01:25:22,441
What is that thing?

977
01:25:24,361 --> 01:25:25,736
I'll tell you.

978
01:25:26,696 --> 01:25:28,739
It's electric shock treatment.

979
01:25:30,742 --> 01:25:33,828
We're in for a long night,
because I don't know shit.

980
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,540
We'll see.

981
01:25:46,258 --> 01:25:47,258
Hit him again!

982
01:25:57,227 --> 01:25:58,227
Again!

983
01:26:03,608 --> 01:26:05,151
Tell me about the shipment!

984
01:26:07,571 --> 01:26:10,114
I'm gonna fucking kill both of you!

985
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,741
Very funny.
What about the shipment?

986
01:26:18,414 --> 01:26:20,498
The shipment, Mr. Murtaugh.

987
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:22,792
Go spit!

988
01:26:24,086 --> 01:26:25,086
Salt.

989
01:26:40,561 --> 01:26:44,397
Go spit, you son of a bitch.
Fuck you!

990
01:26:45,232 --> 01:26:46,858
This is getting nowhere.

991
01:26:47,067 --> 01:26:48,234
Mr. Large.

992
01:26:55,492 --> 01:26:56,826
He knows shit. We're safe.

993
01:26:57,036 --> 01:26:59,913
He'd have told us.
Nobody can take that.

994
01:27:00,623 --> 01:27:01,956
Fine.

995
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:03,583
Badass soldier, huh?

996
01:27:18,223 --> 01:27:19,389
Get her up.

997
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,189
Untie me and I'll kill
all of you bastards!

998
01:27:27,398 --> 01:27:29,149
Tell me what you know.

999
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:32,069
Fuck you, bastard!
I'll kill you!

1000
01:27:39,535 --> 01:27:41,328
Sorry, pal.
Say good night.

1001
01:28:03,184 --> 01:28:06,436
That's a real good-looking
young woman...

1002
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:09,022
...you got there, Mr. Murtaugh.

1003
01:28:11,943 --> 01:28:13,151
I've told you everything.

1004
01:28:13,361 --> 01:28:14,861
We'll soon know, won't we?

1005
01:28:15,071 --> 01:28:16,655
I'm warning you.

1006
01:28:17,031 --> 01:28:18,031
Don't.

1007
01:28:18,408 --> 01:28:20,616
Spare me, son. It's over.

1008
01:28:21,118 --> 01:28:23,577
There's no more heroes
left in the world.

1009
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:30,293
Kill that son of a bitch!

1010
01:28:41,763 --> 01:28:43,431
That asshole's getting away!

1011
01:28:43,682 --> 01:28:45,683
Who's fucking next?

1012
01:28:46,143 --> 01:28:47,685
McAllister!

1013
01:28:47,936 --> 01:28:49,103
Who's next?

1014
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:53,774
Pretty thin, huh?

1015
01:28:54,026 --> 01:28:55,484
Anorexic.

1016
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:05,286
- Let's do what the shepherd did.
- What?

1017
01:29:05,495 --> 01:29:07,288
Get the flock out of here.

1018
01:29:19,217 --> 01:29:20,592
Is it him?

1019
01:29:20,926 --> 01:29:23,053
No. It's not Joshua.

1020
01:30:39,963 --> 01:30:41,797
Halt! Stop! Stop!

1021
01:30:42,006 --> 01:30:44,758
Get out of the fucking car!
Come on, now!

1022
01:30:47,595 --> 01:30:48,679
Police officers!

1023
01:31:05,238 --> 01:31:10,159
I'm a police officer. Give me
some backup and take care of the girl.

1024
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:43,149
- He's going for the freeway!
- You okay?

1025
01:31:47,654 --> 01:31:51,657
Cut over the 3rd Street bridge!
You'll get ahead of him.

1026
01:31:54,786 --> 01:31:56,621
General McAllister...

1027
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,333
...time for you to die.

1028
01:32:48,756 --> 01:32:49,923
Hold it!

1029
01:33:12,655 --> 01:33:14,406
Get back in your car!

1030
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:38,637
Mind if I test-drive your Audi?

1031
01:33:42,267 --> 01:33:44,476
Stop the son of a bitch!

1032
01:33:49,524 --> 01:33:50,524
Shit!

1033
01:33:52,611 --> 01:33:53,944
He got my car!

1034
01:33:56,781 --> 01:33:58,866
- Get back!
- Hey, man, I'm cool.

1035
01:34:10,003 --> 01:34:11,629
Let's get out of here!

1036
01:34:15,592 --> 01:34:16,592
Open the door!

1037
01:34:26,685 --> 01:34:28,978
Kill that cop son of a bitch!

1038
01:34:31,398 --> 01:34:33,816
No way you live. No way.

1039
01:35:59,902 --> 01:36:02,070
- Gangway!
- Hold it now.

1040
01:36:02,321 --> 01:36:04,448
- Police officer.
- Go ahead.

1041
01:36:09,912 --> 01:36:12,706
Well, shit!
What now, kid?

1042
01:36:13,332 --> 01:36:15,959
First thing, we get you to hospital.

1043
01:36:16,502 --> 01:36:18,170
Come on. Let's go.

1044
01:36:19,213 --> 01:36:22,007
Don't breathe this stuff.
You'll see pink elephants.

1045
01:36:22,258 --> 01:36:24,217
The slippery son of a bitch got away!

1046
01:36:24,469 --> 01:36:27,137
- What do you mean he got away?
- Hey, fire me.

1047
01:36:30,307 --> 01:36:31,474
Where you going?

1048
01:36:31,808 --> 01:36:33,684
Sarge, I'm commandeering your car.

1049
01:36:33,935 --> 01:36:35,227
What's the matter?

1050
01:36:35,437 --> 01:36:38,022
My home!
The bastard knows where I live.

1051
01:36:38,231 --> 01:36:40,107
I'll drive, Cochise.

1052
01:36:41,151 --> 01:36:43,819
- I got to look at him!
- He's all right.

1053
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,950
3-W-30 en route to
Sgt. Murtaugh's residence.

1054
01:36:50,202 --> 01:36:52,495
Requesting additional units.

1055
01:37:26,279 --> 01:37:28,113
Excuse me, sir.
May we help you?

1056
01:37:28,615 --> 01:37:29,615
No, thank you.

1057
01:37:56,976 --> 01:37:58,852
Good morning, sir.

1058
01:38:00,062 --> 01:38:02,230
Tell me, what day is it?

1059
01:38:03,607 --> 01:38:05,275
Goddamn Christmas!

1060
01:38:06,819 --> 01:38:09,279
I'll give you a home
to come back to.

1061
01:38:27,381 --> 01:38:29,591
Crazy son of a bitch!

1062
01:38:49,152 --> 01:38:50,777
Give me that. Drop it.

1063
01:39:00,496 --> 01:39:01,997
Looking for the general?

1064
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:07,294
He's barbecuing his nuts
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1065
01:39:15,053 --> 01:39:16,887
What do you say, Jack?

1066
01:39:17,889 --> 01:39:19,640
Like a shot at the title?

1067
01:39:20,642 --> 01:39:22,309
Don't mind if I do.

1068
01:39:38,992 --> 01:39:43,412
Okay, men! I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
My responsibility here!

1069
01:39:44,206 --> 01:39:45,873
Watch commander is en route.

1070
01:39:46,124 --> 01:39:49,585
Until then, Sgt. Murtaugh
is in charge on site.

1071
01:39:53,757 --> 01:39:55,841
Just keep the citizens clear.

1072
01:40:07,813 --> 01:40:09,563
Keep everyone back!

1073
01:40:17,823 --> 01:40:20,783
It's Sgt. Riggs' arrest.
I take full responsibility!

1074
01:40:20,993 --> 01:40:23,369
The son of a bitch
killed two of our men!

1075
01:40:29,292 --> 01:40:30,793
Get him, kid!
He's yours!

1076
01:40:45,725 --> 01:40:47,475
Come on, Riggs! Come on!

1077
01:40:56,027 --> 01:40:58,737
You wanna quit now?
You wanna quit?

1078
01:41:08,289 --> 01:41:10,290
Give me your nightstick!

1079
01:41:20,301 --> 01:41:21,342
Come on!

1080
01:41:22,178 --> 01:41:23,595
Show me what you got!

1081
01:41:30,519 --> 01:41:32,020
Eat this, sucker!

1082
01:41:57,712 --> 01:41:58,796
Let them take him!

1083
01:41:59,798 --> 01:42:01,298
Let me take him!

1084
01:42:03,468 --> 01:42:05,052
No! Back off!

1085
01:42:43,841 --> 01:42:45,216
Break his fucking neck!

1086
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:54,267
It's not worth it.

1087
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:01,732
You lose.

1088
01:43:10,367 --> 01:43:12,535
Get that shit off my lawn!

1089
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:19,041
How you doing, kid?

1090
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:45,984
I got you.

1091
01:43:46,444 --> 01:43:47,903
I got you, partner.

1092
01:44:24,774 --> 01:44:26,942
Merry Christmas, Victoria Lynn.

1093
01:44:28,694 --> 01:44:29,986
I love you.

1094
01:44:55,136 --> 01:44:56,303
How are you?

1095
01:44:56,972 --> 01:44:59,306
I'm going to be all right. You?

1096
01:44:59,683 --> 01:45:00,975
I'm good.

1097
01:45:04,145 --> 01:45:06,021
Give this to your dad, okay?

1098
01:45:06,356 --> 01:45:09,525
It's a present for him.
Tell him I won't need it anymore.

1099
01:45:10,318 --> 01:45:13,362
- It's a bullet.
- Yeah, it's a bullet.

1100
01:45:14,155 --> 01:45:15,698
He'll understand.

1101
01:45:17,409 --> 01:45:19,493
You want to come in?
We're building.

1102
01:45:21,454 --> 01:45:23,414
No, I gotta go.

1103
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:27,835
You have a nice Christmas, though.

1104
01:45:28,378 --> 01:45:29,670
Okay. You too.

1105
01:45:30,714 --> 01:45:31,714
Okay. Bye.

1106
01:45:32,007 --> 01:45:33,173
Bye.

1107
01:45:48,188 --> 01:45:50,273
After all we've been through...

1108
01:45:50,482 --> 01:45:54,694
...if you think I'm gonna eat
the world's worst turkey by myself...

1109
01:45:54,945 --> 01:45:56,070
...you're crazy.

1110
01:45:57,197 --> 01:46:00,074
- I'll tell you a little secret.
- What?

1111
01:46:00,284 --> 01:46:01,617
I'm not crazy.

1112
01:46:04,246 --> 01:46:05,246
I know.

1113
01:46:06,081 --> 01:46:07,206
Oh, good. Let's eat.

1114
01:46:08,792 --> 01:46:10,335
Hey, you know something?

1115
01:46:10,544 --> 01:46:12,503
I think your daughter likes me.

1116
01:46:12,755 --> 01:46:15,131
- If you touch her, I'll kill you.
- You'll try.

1117
01:46:15,382 --> 01:46:18,634
- You mind if I bring a friend?
- Of course, bring a friend.

1118
