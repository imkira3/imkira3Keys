2
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,995
Cardinal Richelieu,
these men they...

3
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,630
Please help me, your eminence.
Please, please have mercy. Please.

4
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,335
He defaced your carriage
and stole valuables from inside.

5
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,636
But it's just a coach.

6
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,095
Please, I was hungry.
My family hasn't eaten for days.

7
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,473
Please. Please.
In the name of God, I beg you.

8
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,105
Very well.

9
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,101
In the name of God.

10
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,028
Oh, thank you, your eminence.

11
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,110
Your place in heaven
will always be assured.

12
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,442
Of course.

13
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,206
No! No! Don't!

14
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,329
No! Please!
Please! God, no!

15
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,922
One less mouth to feed.

16
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,148
Getting sloppy, Girard.

17
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,525
Why don't you do yourself a favor?
Surrender.

18
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,156
My sister's honor is at stake.

19
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,825
How many times do I have to tell you?
Nothing happened.

20
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,656
I know what I saw, D'Artagnan.

21
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,280
Girard, I told her
I was leaving for Paris.

22
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,199
She wanted to give me somethin'
to remember her by.

23
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,826
Liar!

24
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,919
This is stupid, Girard.

25
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,175
All I wanna do is get to Paris...
and join the Musketeers.

26
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,383
You, a Musketeer?
Fantasy!

27
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,137
My father was a Musketeer,
the king's personal bodyguard.

28
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,726
The king was assassinated.
Your father was a failure,

29
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,512
a disgrace to the Musketeers.

30
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,559
What did you say?

31
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,229
Your father was a disgrace.

32
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,288
My brothers will avenge me.

33
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,168
Already?

34
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,929
Charge! Charge!

35
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,976
Get him! He's mine!

36
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,733
Come back! Come back!

37
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,154
Ooh!

38
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,748
He went that way!

39
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,240
Yeah!

40
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,500
We'll get you, D'Artagnan!

41
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,246
In the meantime,
give my regards to your sister.

42
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,186
What should I do
with the Musketeer flag?

43
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,353
Burn it.

44
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,418
Musketeers.

45
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,465
By joint edict of his majesty
the King Louis XIII...

46
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,005
And his eminence Cardinal Richelieu,

47
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:41,098
the Musketeers are officially disbanded.

48
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,186
In preparation
for the coming war with England,

49
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,686
the ranks and commissions
are forthwith transferred to the infantry.

50
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,822
You shall be notified
and told where to report.

51
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,327
Until such time,
return to your homes.

52
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,409
And who will protect the king?

53
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,785
The cardinal's guards
have already assumed that responsibility.

54
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,085
You are ordered to disperse.

55
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,889
Should even one of you resist,

56
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,850
the entire corps will be arrested
and imprisoned.

57
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,890
All for one...

58
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,480
And one for all.

59
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,024
Well, there's nothing
more to be said, is there?

60
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,119
Your eminence.

61
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,868
An impressive performance.

62
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,920
I especially admired
that last touch...

63
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,375
"All for one and one for all."

64
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,800
If I didn't know better, I should
have thought you wanted them to riot.

65
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,550
It would have given us an excuse
to arrest them.

66
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,561
Hardly necessary.
The Musketeers are finished.

67
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,394
Not entirely.
There are three.

68
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,234
Three?

69
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,908
I sent a patrol to find them.
They haven't returned yet.

70
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,778
I want those Musketeers,
not excuses.

71
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,117
Bring them in at once!

72
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,409
Follow me.

73
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,342
No loose ends this time,
Captain Rochefort.

74
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,054
Athos.

75
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,843
Porthos.

76
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,807
Aramis.

77
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,009
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

78
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,479
Hyah! Hyah!

79
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,903
Ohh!

80
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,828
Whoa!

81
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,183
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

82
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,147
I've saved you and your friend
from these bandits.

83
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,527
These bandits are
the queen's own bodyguards.

84
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,160
The queen?

85
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,656
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

86
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,825
- What's your name?
- D'Artagnan.

87
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,791
D'Artagnan. A gascon?

88
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,206
I've come to Paris
to join the Musketeers.

89
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,833
Then I'm sure I'll be
hearing your name again.

90
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,711
Would that please you?

91
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,174
Ladies-in-waiting are forbidden
to socialize with Musketeers.

92
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,220
Well, I'm not a Musketeer yet.

93
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,140
With that kind of courage,
you will be one soon enough.

94
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,772
Good luck, D'Artagnan.

95
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,233
And thank you for the entertainment.
I enjoyed it immensely.

96
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,405
Wait! You didn't tell me your name!

97
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,944
Constance!

98
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,829
Constance.

99
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,413
Come along.

100
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,431
Is this Musketeer headquarters?

101
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,063
No, this was Musketeer headquarters.

102
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,318
Oh, you mean it's been moved.

103
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,910
No, I mean the Musketeers
have been disbanded. They no longer exist.

104
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,289
Feel free to poke around for souvenirs
if you wish.

105
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,874
But I just got here.

106
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,831
How am I supposed to become
a Musketeer if they've been disbanded?

107
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,042
I'd say you've got quite a problem.

108
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,214
You're not being very helpful.

109
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,589
You need a lesson in manners, boy.

110
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,090
Anytime.

111
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,137
Why don't you meet me outside the city,
by the ruins?

112
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,305
Let's say noon?

113
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,979
I'll be there!

114
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,198
There he is.

115
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,371
Come on! Out of my way, man!
Out of my way!

116
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,207
How dare you touch me?

117
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,582
D'Artagnan!

118
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,911
Get your hands off me!
D'Artagnan!

119
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,289
D'Artagnan!

120
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,040
Here. Hold this horse for me, all right?

121
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,467
I'll be right back.
You got it? Thank you.

122
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,366
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Excuse me!

123
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,534
This sash was a gift to me
from the queen of America.

124
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,953
There's no
queen of America.

125
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,497
I beg to differ, infant.

126
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,383
We're on quite intimate terms
unless you can prove otherwise.

127
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,465
Here's my proof.

128
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,056
Oh, I see.
It's twit of the month.

129
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,933
Come to challenge the mighty Porthos.

130
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,804
- Thinks he's lightning with a sword.
- The mighty who?

131
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,140
Don't tell me you've never heard of me.

132
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,937
The world's biggest windbag?

133
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:13,610
Little pimple, meet me
behind the Luxembourg at one o'clock,

134
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,573
and bring a long wooden box.

135
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,034
Bring your own.

136
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,421
"God took them and put them
in the garden to till it and care for it,

137
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,253
"but of the fruit of the tree,
which is in the midst of the garden,

138
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,964
"God hath said,
'Ye shall not eat of it.

139
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,964
"Neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.'

140
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,347
"Then the serpent said
unto the woman, 'Ye...'"

141
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,773
Madam, I'm flattered,
but I am here to tutor you in theology.

142
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,612
Forgive me, Monsieur Aramis,

143
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,656
but when you started talking
about original sin,

144
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,075
I lost control
and became impassioned.

145
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,078
It won't happen again.
Please go on.

146
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,705
Well, there's nothing unholy
about expressing one's emotions.

147
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,996
On the contrary,
religion should be experienced

148
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,539
in an all-embracing way.

149
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,668
We should feel free to
express our spirituality.

150
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,591
Yes, darling.

151
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,131
- Let me in!
- My husband!

152
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,596
- You're married?
- Yes, I'm married.

153
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,895
Ohh. We must pray for our sins.

154
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,777
On second thought, God's often busy.

155
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,408
- Out of my way, woman!
- No! Stop!

156
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,916
Ahh! Thank you.
You broke my fall perfectly.

157
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,919
- But I do apologize for the inconvenience.
- Get off of me!

158
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,009
If there's one thing I can't abide,
it's rudeness.

159
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,257
- You fell on me.
- And I apologized for it.

160
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,717
Well, your apology's not accepted.

161
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,595
I hope your sword is
as quick as your mouth.

162
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,181
- It's quicker.
- Ahh.

163
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,642
A duel then.

164
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,352
A duel.

165
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,984
Meet me behind the Carmes-Deschaux
monastery at 2:00.

166
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,229
- I'll be there.
- As will I.

167
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,488
Three duels in one day.

168
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,303
Homesick?

169
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,177
Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised me.

170
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,847
I often have that effect on people.

171
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,429
I can't imagine why.

172
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,477
I'm really a very gentle person.

173
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,031
You seem a little unhappy
in your new home.

174
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,622
Lonely.
Is that the same thing?

175
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,956
Austria's loss is France's gain.

176
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,045
I'm not sure the king
shares your opinion.

177
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,331
We've barely spoken
since our wedding day.

178
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,051
Whenever we're together,
he seems so...

179
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,338
uncertain.

180
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,844
Arranged marriages can be difficult.

181
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,885
Your father and I thought yours

182
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,598
would bring Austria and France
closer together.

183
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,355
Countries align more swiftly
than people, I'm afraid.

184
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,190
What a pity.

185
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,823
Love is, I think,

186
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,784
wasted on the young.

187
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,832
His majesty, the king.

188
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,003
Cardinal Richelieu,
I've been looking for you.

189
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,005
Your majesty.

190
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,797
Anne, I didn't know you were here.

191
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,013
- Would you like me to go?
- No. Please stay.

192
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,766
Your eminence, I demand an answer.

193
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,185
Perhaps if I knew the question.

194
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,104
I just learned that you went ahead
and disbanded my Musketeers.

195
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,313
- You approved the decision.
- But not the timing.

196
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:22,191
I intended to address them myself
and explain the situation.

197
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,358
These men are not just my personal guards.
They are my friends.

198
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,827
A thousand apologies, your majesty.

199
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,202
We are on the brink of war with England.

200
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,543
The Duke of Buckingham plans
to invade La Rochelle within the month,

201
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:42,083
and we'll need the Musketeers in the field
if we are to defeat him.

202
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,673
I thought it best to act quickly.

203
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,640
I will be the judge of what is best,
for me and for France!

204
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,804
Of course.

205
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,264
Forgive me.

206
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,543
He is becoming as troublesome
as his father.

207
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,788
He's a foolish boy and barely that.

208
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,131
That foolish boy is about to become a man,

209
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,342
which is all the more reason
for us to act quickly.

210
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:29,054
- Have our loose ends been tied up?
- Two patrols have been sent.

211
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,925
I trust, Captain Rochefort,

212
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,561
that you are doing everything
in your power to rid us of these rebels.

213
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,766
Don't let having only one eye
impair your vision.

214
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,855
The loss of the other could be most...
inconvenient.

215
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,719
What is this?

216
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:18,099
We are having a private party,
celebrating the demise of the Musketeers.

217
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,721
Go away.

218
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,891
Athos, is that any way
to greet our guests?

219
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,685
Gentlemen, don't be shy.
Come in.

220
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,819
Your friends have been expecting you.

221
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,358
You're under arrest.

222
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,274
Under whose authority?

223
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,025
Mine.

224
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,077
Ah, hello again, Cyclops.

225
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,495
Let's see. When was the last time
we had the pleasure of his company?

226
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,044
I believe it was the day he was cast out
of the Musketeers.

227
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,676
Conduct unbecoming a Musketeer.
That was the charge, was it not?

228
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,672
You should know.
Three of you stood against me.

229
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,473
It was the least
we could do.

230
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,720
You are hereby ordered to surrender
your tunics and your commissions at once.

231
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,264
You can, of course, refuse,

232
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,308
become outlaws, hunted men.

233
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,814
But why not
come along quietly...

234
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,030
For old times' sake?

235
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,908
Did I miss anyone?

236
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,919
Congratulations, Porthos.
You brought down the house.

237
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,541
Oh, drat.

238
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,414
I was trying to hit Rochefort.

239
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,175
You go back, and you
tell the cardinal...

240
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,765
We will continue
to perform our sworn duty,

241
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,555
which is to protect the king.

242
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,728
And we will use every means
within our power to fight him.

243
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,440
Bold words.

244
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,147
I look forward
to ramming them down your throat.

245
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,492
Rochefort. Isn't that
a smelly kind of a cheese?

246
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,725
Your manners
have not improved yet.

247
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,020
- You're late.
- You in a hurry to die?

248
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,238
Here come
the grave diggers now.

249
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,695
Athos, you cannot fight this boy.

250
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,746
- Why not?
- I'm fighting him.

251
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,163
Not until 1 o'clock.

252
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,076
- I have a duel with him, too.
- Not until 2 o'clock.

253
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,921
Let's get on with it then.

254
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,416
Wouldn't want you to be late
for your future engagements.

255
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,796
You're a Musketeer?

256
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,141
You're all Musketeers?

257
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,097
You choose your opponents well.

258
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,647
- Or should I say foolishly?
- I've been looking all over for you.

259
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,604
Now you've found us.
We have some business to attend to...

260
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,560
Unless, of course,
you'd like to make it for a later date.

261
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,317
No.
I'm a man of honor.

262
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,117
But believe me when I say that
killing you will bring me no pleasure.

263
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,404
I'll be with you
gentlemen in a moment.

264
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,498
- Oh, he's a feisty little fellow.
- Feisty indeed.

265
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,456
There they are!

266
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,172
Only a fool would try and
arrest us twice in one day.

267
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,548
You're under arrest.

268
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,634
- A fool.
- A fool.

269
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,307
The boy's of no interest to me.
He's free to go.

270
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,635
You coming peacefully,
or do you intend to resist?

271
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,720
Oh, don't be so stupid.
Of course we intend to resist.

272
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:48,976
Just give us a moment, all right?

273
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,435
Five of them, three of us.
Hardly seems fair.

274
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,611
Maybe we should give them a chance

275
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,562
- to surrender?
- Hmm.

276
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,364
Excuse me, but there's four of us.

277
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,191
It's not your fight.
You're not a Musketeer.

278
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,326
I may not wear the tunic,

279
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,994
but I believe I have
the heart of a Musketeer.

280
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,614
- Warrior.
- Poet.

281
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,373
You got a name, boy?

282
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,707
D'Artagnan.

283
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,881
- Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
- Hello.

284
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,169
- Nice to meet you again.
- Pleasure.

285
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,384
Everyone acquainted?

286
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,047
Now we are prepared to resist you.

287
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,813
Aha!

288
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,892
Oh!

289
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,655
Oh!
God, I love my work.

290
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,515
Take a look at our young friend.

291
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,229
My god, he's still alive.

292
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,420
May the lord forgive you for any sins
you may have committed.

293
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,838
Amen.

294
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,224
What's he doing?

295
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,476
Last rites.
Aramis takes death very seriously.

296
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,481
Is he a priest?

297
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,775
He used to be one of
the cardinal's students.

298
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,816
You, boy,

299
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,994
are arrogant, hot-tempered
and entirely too bold.

300
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,823
I like that.
Reminds me of me.

301
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,620
Don't encourage him.

302
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,164
By helping us, the boy
has made himself an outlaw as well.

303
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,046
- Not if he leaves Paris right now.
- I can't leave now.

304
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,004
- I just got here.
- Go home. Find a wench.

305
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,834
Raise fat babies.
Live a good long life.

306
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:50,555
All for one and one for all?

307
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,850
Wake up, boy.
The Musketeers are just a dream.

308
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,282
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

309
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,279
Hyah!

310
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,211
Halt! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

311
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,129
Long live the Musketeers!

312
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,593
He's mine.

313
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,198
Whoa, whoa!

314
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,389
- My sword!
- It's magnificent.

315
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,850
Where did you steal it?

316
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,516
It belonged to my father.

317
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,393
Your father.

318
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,568
Well, now it
belongs to me.

319
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,616
I collect swords, you see.

320
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,703
I take them from men I've killed.

321
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,701
Well, I'm not dead yet.

322
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,577
You and the Musketeers are responsible
for the killing of the cardinal's guards,

323
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,203
an offense punishable by death.

324
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,166
They interrupted a duel
we were fighting.

325
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:51,464
- A deed also punishable by death.
- It's been a busy day.

326
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,505
Tell me where to find
the Musketeers...

327
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,474
And I will give you back
your father's sword.

328
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,520
Give me back my father's sword...

329
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,518
And I'll cut out your heart.

330
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,321
Idiot.

331
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,866
Like your father.

332
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,209
- Take him below.
- Yes, sir.

333
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,903
Hey, boy!

334
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:38,907
Leave us.

335
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:56,884
Milady de Winter.

336
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,013
Your eminence.

337
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,436
Your beauty would make
even the most chaste of men think of...

338
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,100
Impurity.

339
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,187
I don't believe you suffer
the burden of chastity.

340
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,979
Perhaps you're right.

341
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,453
I was making an observation,
not an offer.

342
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,496
A word of caution, milady.

343
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,952
A snap of my fingers and you could be
back on the block where I found you.

344
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,663
And with a flick of my wrist,

345
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,382
I could change your religion.

346
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,296
You're very persuasive.

347
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,521
For a moment, I forgot that your lovers
have a tendency to end up dead.

348
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,816
Love has its risks.

349
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,977
So does duty.

350
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,029
The precision with which you
disposed of your husband,

351
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,281
or should I say your ex-husband,

352
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,327
Lord de Winter, was commendable,

353
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,033
not to mention helpful to our cause.

354
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,078
- I do what is necessary.
- Yes.

355
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,619
I have a new mission
which requires your

356
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,042
- singular talent.
- What is it?

357
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,716
You will carry this treaty
to the Duke of Buckingham.

358
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,960
You're making an alliance with England?

359
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,795
The king has left me no choice.

360
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,141
The boy is beginning to believe
that he should rule France instead of me.

361
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,767
God forbid.

362
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,932
You're to leave at once for Calais.

363
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,522
A ship called the Persephone
will carry you to England.

364
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,899
She sails Tuesday at midnight.

365
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,356
Buckingham's signature
must be next to mine...

366
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,479
Before the king's birthday Friday.

367
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,690
Consider it done.

368
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,246
And doing so will earn
you the gratitude...

369
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,832
of a king.

370
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,035
Until that day,
your eminence.

371
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:57,255
Or should I say,
"your majesty"?

372
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,880
Majesty sounds good.

373
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,771
Looking for me?

374
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,107
Kneel. Were you taught no respect
for a man of God?

375
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,484
Cardinal Richelieu.

376
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,857
How much did you overhear?

377
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,900
Hardly a word, your eminence.
The voices were much too low.

378
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,278
- And with all the noise from the prison...
- What's your name, boy?

379
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,656
D'Artagnan.

380
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,662
D'Artagnan.

381
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,542
Oh, yes.
Your father was a Musketeer.

382
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,839
He died while protecting the king.

383
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,844
The dream of every warrior...

384
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,018
dying nobly for king and country.

385
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,270
Tell me, D'Artagnan.

386
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,228
What noble business brings you here?

387
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,026
I came to join
the king's Musketeers.

388
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,237
Bad timing.

389
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,194
So I've heard.

390
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,651
Like the knights
of the round table,

391
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,737
the Musketeers have
outlived their usefulness...

392
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,785
And so have your three friends.

393
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,368
Tell me where they are,
and I will spare your life.

394
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,495
I can't tell you what I don't know.

395
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,998
Give my regards to the headsman
and your father.

396
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,169
Wait!

397
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,301
- You object to losing your head?
- Yes. I like it where it is.

398
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:34,059
Then tell me what I want to know,
and maybe you will keep it a while longer!

399
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,723
I don't know where they are.

400
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,476
And if you did?

401
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,021
I wouldn't tell you.

402
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,362
I admire your courage,
D'Artagnan.

403
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,035
You might have made
a fine Musketeer.

404
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,947
But now we'll never know, will we?

405
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,759
They're bringing him down.

406
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,100
It's your time, lad.
Step down.

407
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,739
Milady left at midnight
by private coach.

408
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,486
A remarkable woman.
The most beautiful I've ever known.

409
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,908
And the deadliest.

410
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,873
Which would explain my attraction.

411
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,377
How is our young daredevil holding up?

412
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,548
He's wishing he never
heard of the Musketeers.

413
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,525
D'Artagnan!

414
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,622
Don't lose your head!

415
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,211
Fear not, my son.
For we are with you always.

416
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,247
All for one...

417
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,045
And one for all.

418
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,799
Now this ax was a gift to me
from the czarina of Tokyo.

419
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,406
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

420
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,407
Hyah!

421
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,960
My carriage!

422
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,628
Gentlemen, your carriage,
compliments of the cardinal.

423
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,345
Hyah! Hyah!

424
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,599
Stop! Follow them!
Come on! Come on!

425
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,984
D'Artagnan!

426
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,997
Aha! The cardinal's
sacred snack chamber.

427
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,206
And what have we here?

428
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,215
Is he a man of God
or a man of gold?

429
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,421
- Hyah!
- D'Artagnan!

430
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,263
Would you be so kind
as to redistribute this wealth?

431
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,180
Throw the coins, lad!
The people are hungry!

432
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,191
Well done.

433
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,696
Those Musketeers are a menace.
They must be stopped.

434
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,162
The boy knows our plans.

435
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:26,792
One thousand gold pieces
on each of their heads, dead or alive.

436
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,460
I prefer dead.

437
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,301
Hyah!

438
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,810
Hyah! Hyah!

439
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,269
They're firing at us!

440
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,650
Champagne?

441
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,816
We're in the middle
of a chase, Porthos.

442
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,698
You're right. Something red.

443
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,175
For a chase, the cardinal recommends
his excellent '24 cabernet.

444
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,676
- You can't have any. You're too young.
- Take the reins, boy.

445
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,718
Thank you.

446
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,282
The picnic was delicious.
The champagne was excellent.

447
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,079
Remind me to send
the cardinal a note.

448
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,831
The cardinal! We have to hurry!

449
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,249
You two have a date?

450
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,459
No, it's the cardinal.
He's conspiring against the king!

451
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,507
- Tell us something we don't know.
- He sent a messenger...

452
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,005
with a secret treaty
to man named Buckingham.

453
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,633
- The Duke of Buckingham?
- Do you know him?

454
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,261
He rules England the way
the cardinal rules France.

455
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,933
There's a ship called the <i>Persephone.</i>

456
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,519
It's waiting in Calais
to take the messenger to England.

457
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,225
It sails Tuesday midnight.

458
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,558
We get that treaty, we can prove
the cardinal guilty of treason.

459
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,476
Calais is over 200 leagues from here.

460
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,904
Is the cardinal aware of the fact
that you have this information?

461
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,109
Yes.

462
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,234
Turn here.

463
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,239
- Right here?
- Here!

464
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,742
That's it.
Next time you drive.

465
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,282
Hyah! Hyah!
Let's go! Hyah!

466
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,077
Hyah!

467
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,621
Hyah!

468
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,500
Gimme the reins!

469
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,662
- Hyah!
- Stop in the name of the cardinal!

470
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,132
Hyah!

471
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,052
- Over there! To your left!
- Stop the Musketeers!

472
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,845
Hyah!

473
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,525
Hyah! Hyah!

474
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,399
Unhitch the horses.

475
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,115
This is the end of the line, gentlemen.
I hope you enjoyed the ride.

476
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,364
- Very much so. Thank you.
- Porthos, the brandy.

477
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,206
Ooh, what a waste.

478
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,725
Up the hill!
They're over there!

479
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,288
- It's headed for the powder wagon!
- Run for it!

480
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,085
Run for it!

481
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,978
Hyah!

482
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:38,432
Your eminence, the Musketeers
have been sighted on the road to Calais.

483
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,559
Thanks to our winged friends,

484
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:44,560
every mercenary and bounty hunter
in France will be waiting for them.

485
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,989
All for one...

486
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,868
And more for me.

487
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:21,229
And I said, "Marquaise,

488
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,727
"as I told you
at the sausage festival,

489
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,902
"a queen is no different
from a barmaid in the dark,

490
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,606
"though less practiced
in the arts of massage."

491
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,614
Right? D'Artagnan, if you're going
to be a proper Musketeer,

492
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,738
you shall have to be schooled in the manly
art of wenching. Right, ladies?

493
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,954
Ooh. First subject.

494
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,498
Very good.
Very good indeed.

495
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,208
Let the schooling begin.

496
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,166
The secret to wenching
is in the first kiss.

497
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,801
For in that first kiss,
a lasting impression is made.

498
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,087
Right, ladies?

499
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:56,594
If it is... if it is weak,
she'll think you're weak.

500
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:58,888
If it is comical,
she'll think you a clown.

501
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,516
- With me?
- Weak, weak. Comical, clown.

502
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:06,475
And as a Musketeer is never weak
and only rarely a clown,

503
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,522
your first kiss...

504
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,238
must be all the things
that you are, like this.

505
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,074
Mmm.

506
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,842
See? You may, uh,
speak first if you like...

507
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,802
your name, her name,
an endearment or two.

508
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,640
Trust me, words are a complete waste
of time at this sensitive point.

509
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,343
Only the wrong words are
a complete waste of time.

510
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,474
The right words

511
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,014
can make a more lasting impression
than a thousand of Porthos' kisses.

512
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,938
- Not likely.
- Ah, see?

513
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,522
Shall I demonstrate?

514
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:03,203
As morning hues of sun-swept fire
caress your passionate face,

515
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:07,211
alone with thee a pure desire
to worship untold grace.

516
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,965
My soul would cry in silent prayer
toward hours swept apart.

517
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:16,173
Your essence warms the evening air
as I dance into your heart.

518
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,300
Mmm.

519
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,050
- Shakespeare.
- Aramis.

520
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,553
- Cheating.
- It was beautiful.

521
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,770
- Thank you.
- Mmm-mmm.

522
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,990
Very well, D'Artagnan.
Your turn.

523
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,739
Ahh!

524
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,461
As morning hues of sun-swept...

525
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:55,792
Fire.

526
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,213
...fire caress your poisoned face...

527
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:07,061
Bravo! The boy's a natural!

528
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,817
Ohh! A lively tune.

529
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,776
I'm inspired to dance.

530
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,960
Why's Athos sittin' by himself?

531
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,080
He takes his drinking
very seriously.

532
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:37,668
Not to worry. He'll be his usual,
charming self by morning.

533
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,852
Ho-ho-ho!
A lovely time!

534
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,599
Athos, why don't you come join us?

535
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,445
You fight like a man.
See if you can drink like one.

536
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,778
I'll drink anything
you put in front of me.

537
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,860
Famous last words.

538
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,909
What should we drink to?

539
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,908
Let's drink to love.

540
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,870
To love.

541
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,502
Let me tell you
a story about love, D'Artagnan.

542
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:21,420
I knew a young man once, a count,
who feared he would never fall in love.

543
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,889
One day, he met a woman.
This woman was more than beautiful.

544
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,761
She was intoxicating, mysterious,
everything he'd ever dreamed of.

545
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,970
He felt his heart would burst
if he couldn't have her.

546
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,226
What happened?

547
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,016
The poor idiot married her.

548
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,768
Isn't that what people do
when they fall in love?

549
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,228
Shut up and listen to me.

550
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,694
They were riding
through the forest one day.

551
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,571
She was thrown from her horse
and knocked unconscious.

552
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,787
When he rushed to her side,
he noticed a mark on her body...

553
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,660
something he'd never seen before,

554
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,909
something she'd managed
to keep hidden all this time.

555
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,457
- What was it?
- The brand of the fleur-de-lis,

556
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,464
the mark given to those who
are to be executed for murder.

557
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,502
The count was crushed.
The woman he loved, his bride,

558
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,880
had betrayed him.
She'd lied to him.

559
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,683
When she came to, she swore that she'd
been falsely accused of these crimes,

560
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,556
but he didn't believe her.

561
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,979
He rejected her for her lies
and for her past.

562
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,227
Then he banished her
from his province.

563
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:22,277
When the guards came to take
her away to be executed, she...

564
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,951
she was still professing
her undying love.

565
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:36,582
Soon after, the count realized how much
she had meant to him, but it was too late.

566
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,586
His betrayal was far greater
than hers could ever have been.

567
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,757
He gave up his title, his land,
everything he believed in,

568
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:49,766
never to be seen or heard from again,
all because of love.

569
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,193
Whoo! May I have this dance?

570
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:20,831
How's your head, D'Artagnan?

571
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,046
I'm beginning to wish
the cardinal had chopped it off.

572
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,843
Would you stop whistling, please?

573
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,966
- I'm not whistling.
- Well, somebody's whistling.

574
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,674
- Barmaid's kiss left him dizzy.
- I hear it, too.

575
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:33,635
Sounds like a cannonball.

576
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,848
Oh, I hate cannonballs.

577
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,312
Whoa!

578
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,570
- The cardinal has a long reach.
- Get outta here!

579
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,787
Flank left!

580
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:06,925
Fire!

581
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,514
There they are!
Kill the Musketeers!

582
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,642
We'll split up.
D'Artagnan rides with me.

583
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,473
- We'll see you in Calais.
- Or hell.

584
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,904
Hyah!
Hyah!

585
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,317
Split up!

586
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,070
We need heads
for the reward!

587
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,546
The first time
you saw D'Artagnan,

588
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,382
did you need the laces
in your corset loosened?

589
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,715
Yes. And I felt
my cheeks flush.

590
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,559
But your hands were cold.
My knees trembled.

591
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,304
- But your heart was pounding.
- Yes.

592
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,766
But I don't understand
why I feel this way.

593
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,313
We only met for a moment.

594
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,608
A moment is all it may take.

595
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,234
Do you think so?

596
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,233
When my father
promised me to Louis,

597
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,069
I was furious.

598
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,663
The thought of marrying
a complete stranger,

599
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,541
someone I'd never even seen...

600
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,498
I thought I'd never be happy...

601
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,377
And that I'd never find love.

602
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,135
But then the first time
I saw him and our eyes met,

603
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,467
- I knew.
- What did you know?

604
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,717
What you knew in your heart
when you first saw D'Artagnan.

605
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:41,225
What if he doesn't feel the same?

606
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,477
We must never give up hope.

607
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,479
I'll get you your robe.

608
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,217
What are you doing here?

609
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,503
Forgive me, your majesty.

610
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,925
I need your help...

611
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,472
And could not, in good conscience,
wait another minute.

612
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,436
On what matter?

613
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,724
I'm worried about
the king's happiness.

614
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,274
In what way?

615
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,899
I'm afraid he's fallen
into a dreadful melancholy...

616
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:34,024
And wishes to postpone
his birthday celebration.

617
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,531
Perhaps he's concerned
with more important matters,

618
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,240
like the coming war with England.

619
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,789
Which is exactly why
the celebration must be held:

620
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,750
To show the world
that the king of France...

621
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,995
can face an enemy
on any field,

622
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,498
to show France who is king.

623
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,588
He will listen to you.

624
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:57,881
I will talk to him.

625
00:57:59,017 --> 00:57:59,973
Thank you.

626
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,723
I've always said...

627
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,313
that you are as intelligent...

628
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,854
as you are beautiful.

629
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,775
I'm not worthy
of such a compliment.

630
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,236
Ah, but you are.

631
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,704
It is difficult to be a man
in the service of God.

632
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,873
It is assumed that
certain...

633
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,208
wants,

634
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:29,829
desires,

635
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:32,586
are void from my existence.

636
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,961
But, after all, I'm still a man.

637
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,180
Your sacrifice brings you closer to God.

638
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,179
Yes.

639
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,559
But it is not God
to whom I wish to be close.

640
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:54,237
I want you to consider,
to know...

641
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,991
all that we might
accomplish together.

642
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,078
For France.

643
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,499
I think you should leave.

644
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,965
Remember, kings come and kings go,

645
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,512
but one thing remains the same,

646
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,842
and that is me.

647
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,400
Hyah!

648
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,448
- Do you think we lost them?
- I don't know.

649
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,952
I hope we're close to Calais.

650
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,418
My horse could use a rest,
and my rear is killing me.

651
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,671
You're a good man, D'Artagnan,

652
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,381
much like your father was.

653
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,796
Hyah!

654
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:02,634
You knew my father?

655
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,886
Only by reputation.

656
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,344
His death was mourned
by all Musketeers.

657
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,597
How did he die?

658
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,107
He uncovered a plot
to assassinate the king.

659
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,520
He was led into a trap
by a fellow Musketeer and then murdered.

660
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,070
Musketeer?

661
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,821
Shit!

662
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,331
There they are!

663
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,379
Well, we didn't lose them.

664
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,593
I'll try and hold them off
as long as possible.

665
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:45,302
You ride on without me.
I can't leave you here, not like this.

666
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,467
A Musketeer's first duty
is to protect the king.

667
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,302
You ride on to Calais...

668
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,308
and intercept
the cardinal's messenger.

669
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,061
- There's too many of them!
- Go or I will shoot you myself!

670
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:03,567
- Take these.
- Don't let me down.

671
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,533
- I'll never forget you.
- Go!

672
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:15,836
Hyah! Hyah!

673
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,432
Hyah! Hyah!

674
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,900
Hyah!

675
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,911
Hyah!

676
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,333
Back.

677
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,166
Advance.

678
01:01:59,090 --> 01:01:59,955
Yes.

679
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,337
Now lunge.
One, two, three, four.

680
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,130
Now disarm.

681
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,256
Excellent.

682
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,345
Forgive me for being late,
your majesty.

683
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,224
I was wrestling
with an important affair of state.

684
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,563
Excuse us, please.

685
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,244
Your eminence,

686
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,783
I've been hearing some very
troubling rumors about you.

687
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,664
There are so many to choose from.

688
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,831
Betrayal.

689
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:47,178
Ah, yes, that is usually the first.

690
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,381
Let me see if I
remember it correctly.

691
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,722
While the English attack from without,

692
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,637
the wicked cardinal
undermines from within,

693
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:01,563
forging a secret alliance with Buckingham
and placing himself on the throne.

694
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,611
But really, your majesty,
why stop there.

695
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,865
I have heard much more
festive variations.

696
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,494
I make oaths with pagan gods,

697
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,197
seduce the queen
in her own chamber,

698
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,866
teach pigs to dance
and horses to fly...

699
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:21,208
and keep the moon carefully hidden
within the folds of my robe.

700
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,465
- Have I forgotten anything?
- It does seem rather far-fetched.

701
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,092
Sire, if there are any
doubts about my loyalty,

702
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,889
they will be laid to rest

703
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,634
when we appear together
to celebrate your birthday.

704
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,430
Oh, my birthday.
You know, I've been meaning

705
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,511
- to speak to you...
- The queen.

706
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,814
has just been telling me
how eager she is to attend.

707
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,148
Anne is coming?

708
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:49,737
The entire nation is anxious
to celebrate the birth of its king.

709
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,868
It will be an event to remember.

710
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,704
I promise.

711
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,271
Hyah! Hyah!

712
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,862
Whoa! Whoa!

713
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,574
What is it, Henri?

714
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,917
There's a body
in the road, milady.

715
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,883
It's a young man.

716
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,136
He appears to be injured.

717
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:58,926
He's handsome.

718
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,146
Put him inside.

719
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:04,898
With me.

720
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,629
Welcome back.

721
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:36,926
Did you dream?

722
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,176
Where am I?

723
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,053
We're in Calais.

724
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,646
Calais?

725
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,934
Tuesday at midnight!

726
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,947
Where are my clothes?

727
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,738
Do you have a name or shall I
make one up for you?

728
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,208
My name is D'Artagnan.

729
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,040
D'Artagnan. I like that.

730
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,169
I'm the Countess de Winter, Milady.

731
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,717
- Countess?
- By marriage.

732
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,760
- But my husband's dead.
- I'm sorry.

733
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,094
I've learned to live with death.

734
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:25,142
Uh, Milady, I'm grateful
for all that you've done,

735
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,973
- but I've got...
- What?

736
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:29,392
Important business.

737
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,228
How mysterious.

738
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,650
Does it require clothes?

739
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,866
Yes, I need my clothes.

740
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,820
I'm afraid they won't be ready
for at least an hour.

741
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,039
Until then, you're my prisoner.

742
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:46,367
Would the prisoner care for a drink?

743
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,045
Well, I am thirsty.

744
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,667
What brings you to Calais?

745
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,803
I'm on a mission for the king.

746
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,883
I've heard that before.

747
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,639
- I'm serious.
- You're young.

748
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,934
Young men are given
to exaggeration.

749
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,191
However, if you'd like
to entertain me with a story,

750
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,147
I love a good adventure.

751
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,980
I came to Calais to stop a spy.

752
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,200
- A spy?
- Yes.

753
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:25,577
I believe you. Aren't you afraid?

754
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:29,126
- A Musketeer isn't afraid of anything.
- I knew it.

755
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,250
I knew you were a Musketeer
the moment I saw you.

756
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,628
- You did?
- Of course.

757
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:40,092
But D'Artagnan, if this spy were to
find out you were here,

758
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,924
your life could be
in grave danger.

759
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,016
A Musketeer isn't afraid of danger.

760
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,386
I'm dangerous.

761
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,393
Aren't you afraid of me?

762
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,895
You're not dangerous.

763
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,936
Then what am I?

764
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,532
You're beautiful.

765
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,993
Beauty. Danger.

766
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,450
They are the same.

767
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:18,425
Milady, I'm sorry...

768
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,019
Oh, my god!

769
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,265
Parker!

770
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:46,987
Kill him.

771
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,077
You can kill me,
but a surprise waits for you

772
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,995
that even Buckingham
can't prevent.

773
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,334
You're young and vain,

774
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,462
but I don't know
if you're clever.

775
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,840
I know how you love
a good adventure.

776
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,048
Take him with us.

777
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:05,802
The bodyguards are
waiting outside, Milady.

778
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:06,969
All right.

779
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,181
Can I help you, Lord de Winter?

780
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,767
- Milady de Winter, is she here?
- Oh, no.

781
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,562
- I've not seen her.
- She murdered my brother, old man!

782
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,272
Let's take the back stairs.

783
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:45,970
Whoa!

784
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,363
We are the Countess de Winter's party,
arrived from Paris.

785
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,285
Permission to come aboard?

786
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,242
Permission granted.

787
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,548
Take us to your captain.

788
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,174
What are you, deaf?

789
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,142
Dead.
They're all dead!

790
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,269
Not all of us.

791
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,129
Porthos the pirate!

792
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,259
- Pirate?
- I told you I was famous.

793
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:07,646
Sabine.

794
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,489
Athos.

795
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:14,619
Stop!

796
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:24,997
I thought you were dead.

797
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,965
Cardinal Richelieu
took pity on me.

798
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:31,712
You're the spy.

799
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,715
I've learned
the value of lies.

800
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,266
They've kept me alive.

801
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,766
The treaty, give it to me.

802
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:43,431
No.

803
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,018
I will shoot.

804
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,313
Be kind.

805
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,115
Aim for my heart.

806
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:02,201
Countess de Winter.

807
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,128
I will not be so kind.

808
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,385
The treaty outlines
Richelieu's plan

809
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,217
to forge an alliance
with Buckingham.

810
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,757
- No mention of the king?
- None.

811
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,558
However, the agreement is contingent...

812
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:20,928
upon a demonstration
of the cardinal's power.

813
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:23,104
A demonstration?

814
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,232
- What kind of demonstration?
- I don't know.

815
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,238
I know someone who does.

816
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,702
I wish to speak with your prisoner.

817
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,705
She dies in the morning.

818
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:10,941
There was a time I would have
given my life for a kind word from you.

819
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,231
I could not give it.

820
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:16,404
I was a fool.

821
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,413
Is it true what he says?
Did you kill his brother?

822
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,707
I have become the nightmare...

823
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,418
you once thought me to be.

824
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:29,917
But not before.

825
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:31,877
Not us.

826
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,549
No.

827
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,299
Do you know of the cardinal's plans?

828
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:41,967
I do.

829
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:43,723
Tell me.

830
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,937
Will you have my life spared?

831
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,691
No, I cannot.

832
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,147
Society demands swift justice.

833
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,659
I'll take my secret to the grave.

834
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:06,120
Sabine...

835
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,336
You will die for your crimes.

836
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,582
There is nothing
I can do about that now.

837
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,801
But how you choose
to leave this world is up to you.

838
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,180
What has this world ever done for me?

839
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,293
"I am the resurrection and the life,"
sayeth the lord.

840
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:35,706
"He who believeth in me
shall never die."

841
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,257
We forgive you for your crimes.

842
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:40,381
Die in peace.

843
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,470
On your knees.

844
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:06,779
No!

845
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:10,954
- What is this?
- Sabine, forgive me, please.

846
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,791
I do forgive you.

847
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:32,645
The cardinal intends
to assassinate the king...

848
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,690
on Friday at his birthday celebration.

849
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,458
God's justice be done.

850
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:03,797
Amen.

851
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:27,951
The king's life is in danger.
We have work to do.

852
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,625
- Impressive.
- He can do that every time.

853
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,498
- And he has no qualms about...
- None.

854
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:44,634
He believes a man should honor
no kings before God.

855
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:48,047
A man of faith.
How reassuring.

856
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,351
Whatever you're paying him,
double it.

857
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:57,810
I want the king's birthday
to be a memorable event.

858
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:03,145
And rehang this painting
in my chamber.

859
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:05,731
Just as it is.

860
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,284
He was always
a little too flattering.

861
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:17,743
Horsemen!

862
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,669
Over here!
What does it say?

863
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:19,262
Well, over there.

864
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,599
Search the perimeter.
I'll try to find the king.

865
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,438
- But...
- Go!

866
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,676
You look beautiful.

867
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:51,510
Thank you.

868
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:55,257
Is something wrong?

869
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,973
- Cardinal Richelieu.
- Yes?

870
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,151
He is an evil man.

871
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:09,904
Do not believe
every rumor you hear.

872
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,362
He is powerful.

873
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,528
I ride through the countryside every day.

874
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,495
I've seen the uses of his power.

875
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,202
Power sometimes frightens.

876
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,788
Here in the palace I've seen it too.

877
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,417
I know.

878
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,334
- What should we do?
- I'm not sure.

879
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:33,427
We will do it together.

880
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:19,116
Get back!

881
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,237
Captain, protect their majesties!

882
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,621
- Richelieu!
- Get them inside!

883
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,589
Kill those Musketeers!
They're trying to murder the king!

884
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,322
Save the king!

885
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,289
Go with God.

886
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,124
Aha!

887
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:59,797
I like this.

888
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,042
I think our young friend
could use some help.

889
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:43,885
Hold this.

890
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:06,905
It's about time!

891
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:10,079
Come, D'Artagnan!
We're saving the king!

892
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,709
You have failed.

893
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:26,346
Oh, you are so naive.

894
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,933
Things couldn't be more perfect
if I'd planned them myself.

895
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:36,515
The king of France dies
at the hands of his own personal guard.

896
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:39,600
Grief stricken, terrified,

897
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:42,320
the huddled masses turn for comfort...

898
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:45,281
to their devout spiritual leader...

899
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:49,198
who, ever so humbly,

900
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:51,954
assumes the throne...

901
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,251
- with the queen by his side.
- I would rather die.

902
01:26:57,796 --> 01:26:59,628
That can be arranged!

903
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:09,255
But first your reluctant
husband will be found...

904
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:13,347
pierced through the heart
by the sword of a Musketeer.

905
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,011
The same sword

906
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,267
that failed to protect his father.

907
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:39,918
Ha!

908
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:44,749
I hope we're not interrupting.

909
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:48,052
No, on the contrary.
You're right on time.

910
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:23,838
Follow me.

911
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,841
No!

912
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:59,786
Leaving so soon?

913
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:02,584
Oh, you know
I abhor bloodshed.

914
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:04,332
Especially your own.

915
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,130
Stand aside.

916
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,793
You are under arrest,
charged with treason.

917
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:14,885
You, of all people,
should know that the cardinal

918
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,178
does not answer
to the laws of men.

919
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:20,602
Then you'll answer to God.

920
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:31,071
You first.

921
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,000
Aramis.

922
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:19,237
This sword belongs to me.

923
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:21,489
So it does.

924
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:44,516
Let's see if you're as brave
a man as your father was.

925
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:47,815
And as foolish.

926
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:01,036
Is he dead?

927
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:05,157
Gently, gently.

928
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:09,287
Oh! You see?

929
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,664
There is a God.

930
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:28,807
We're being followed.
Do something about it.

931
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:57,797
My God.

932
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,262
Which one do we take?

933
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,223
- I've never been here before.
- Split up.

934
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:19,027
Whoa, ugly.

935
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:25,784
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

936
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,463
Oh!

937
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,717
Ha-ha!

938
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:46,054
You smelly...

939
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,519
lump of lard!

940
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:41,985
Impressive.

941
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,962
Damn it!

942
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:11,643
How pathetic.

943
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,646
Killed by the same man
that killed his father.

944
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:18,230
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- You killed my father?

945
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:22,234
Oh, yes. As I will you.

946
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:46,008
Well, well,
one thing is certain.

947
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:47,926
You are no Musketeer.

948
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:59,604
I might have been mistaken.

949
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:19,415
For you, father.

950
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:53,074
Let us out of here!

951
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:21,940
Hyah! Hyah!

952
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:26,108
Hyah! Ah!

953
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:29,068
Where have you been?

954
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,362
Taking care of something ugly.

955
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:39,200
Richelieu!

956
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,702
You're too late, Musketeers!

957
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:45,206
By now the Duke of Buckingham's signature
is next to mine.

958
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,332
The alliance is complete!

959
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:50,628
That would be difficult considering
the treaty never left France!

960
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:53,464
A minor problem!

961
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,641
I will return twice as strong...

962
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,728
and the throne will be mine!

963
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:03,599
I think not.

964
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:13,818
You will never harm
another soul ever again.

965
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:16,870
- My promise to God.
- Wait!

966
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:27,419
Well done, your majesty.

967
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:35,339
Are you all right?

968
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:38,433
Yes.

969
01:37:58,664 --> 01:37:59,780
Arise.

970
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:04,584
Is this the man who saved my life?

971
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:07,167
His name's D'Artagnan, sire.

972
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:10,256
D'Artagnan, I'm in your debt.

973
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:13,211
What can I do to repay
the courage you've shown me?

974
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,932
Your majesty,
his heart has but one desire.

975
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:21,598
And that is to become a Musketeer.

976
01:38:23,022 --> 01:38:24,229
Then approach.

977
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:29,358
Kneel.

978
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:40,655
This world is an uncertain realm
filled with danger.

979
01:38:41,374 --> 01:38:43,707
Honor undermined by the pursuit of power.

980
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:47,290
Freedom sacrificed when the weak
are oppressed by the strong.

981
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:51,381
But there are those who oppose
these powerful forces,

982
01:38:52,802 --> 01:38:56,466
who dedicate their lives to truth,
honor and freedom.

983
01:38:58,307 --> 01:39:00,469
These men are known as Musketeers.

984
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:07,518
Rise, D'Artagnan,

985
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:10,859
and join them.

986
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:53,985
Your father would be proud of you.

987
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,566
You're a Musketeer.

988
01:39:56,157 --> 01:39:58,149
What do we do now?
What's next?

989
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:01,576
- Well, we protect the king.
- We protect the queen.

990
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:05,205
- In the name of God.
- And France. Correct?

991
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,032
- France, indeed.
- D'Artagnan!

992
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:13,914
My sister's honor will not
wait a moment longer!

993
01:40:15,635 --> 01:40:17,501
- I'll handle this.
- D'Artagnan...

994
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,087
We also protect each other.

995
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:26,013
All for one...

996
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:27,978
And one for all!

997
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:32,565
Run!

998
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,883
<i>When it's love you give</i>

999
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:02,554
<i>I'll be a man of good faith</i>

1000
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:05,386
<i>When in love you live</i>

1001
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,303
<i>I'll make a stand
I won't break</i>

1002
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:13,224
<i>I'll be the rock you can build on</i>

1003
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:14,775
<i>Yeah</i>

1004
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:21,691
<i>Be there when you're old
To have and to hold</i>

1005
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:24,572
<i>When there's love inside</i>

1006
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:27,746
<i>I swear I'll always be strong</i>

1007
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:30,908
<i>Then there's a reason why</i>

1008
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:34,081
<i>I'll prove to you we belong</i>

1009
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:38,628
<i>I'll be the wall that protects you</i>

1010
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,171
<i>Yeah</i>

1011
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:44,175
<i>From the wind and the rain</i>

1012
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,724
<i>From the hurt and the pain</i>

1013
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:49,851
<i>- Yeah
- Hey</i>

1014
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:55,273
<i>Let's make it all for one</i>

1015
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:57,393
<i>And all for love</i>

1016
01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:03,990
<i>Let the one you hold
Be the one you want</i>

1017
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,028
<i>The one you need</i>

1018
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:11,323
<i>'Cause when it's all for one</i>

1019
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:13,325
<i>It's one for all</i>

1020
01:42:14,754 --> 01:42:17,747
<i>When there's someone that should know</i>

1021
01:42:18,007 --> 01:42:20,795
<i>Then just let your feelings show</i>

1022
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:24,177
<i>And make it all for one</i>

1023
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:26,300
<i>And all for love</i>

1024
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:31,886
<i>When it's love you make</i>

1025
01:42:32,063 --> 01:42:35,397
<i>I'll be the fire in your night</i>

1026
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:38,188
<i>Then it's love you take</i>

1027
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:41,320
<i>I will defend I will fight</i>

1028
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:46,158
<i>I'll be there when you need me</i>

1029
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:47,696
<i>Yeah</i>

1030
01:42:48,871 --> 01:42:51,284
<i>When honor's at stake</i>

1031
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,787
<i>This vow I will make</i>

1032
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:56,910
<i>Yeah</i>

1033
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:02,625
<i>That it's all for one</i>

1034
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,592
<i>And all for love</i>

1035
01:43:05,346 --> 01:43:07,053
<i>It's all for love</i>

1036
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:11,099
<i>Let the one you hold
Be the one you want</i>

1037
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:14,644
<i>The one you need</i>

1038
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:18,557
<i>'Cause when it's all for one</i>

1039
01:43:18,734 --> 01:43:21,647
<i>- It's one for all
- Yeah</i>

1040
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:24,942

<i>'Cause we could stand up to the test</i>

1046
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:47,135
<i>We got everything</i>

1047
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:49,213
<i>And more</i>

1048
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:53,258
<i>Than we had planned</i>

1049
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:55,970
<i>More than the rivers</i>

1050
01:43:56,105 --> 01:43:59,064
<i>That run the land</i>

1051
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:02,354
<i>We got it all</i>

1052
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:05,274
<i>- In our hands
- Yeah</i>

1053
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:32,343
