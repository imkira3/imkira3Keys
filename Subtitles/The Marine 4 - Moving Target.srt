MAN ON RADIO: Turning now to the weather
for your Thursday morning...

40
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,620
here in Bristol Falls.

41
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,740
We have mostly cloudy skies at the moment,
variable light winds...

42
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,180
You can fieldstrip an M4 in the dark.

43

our area all weekend.

47
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,740
Showers likely hitting around evening,

48
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,925
then cloudy with a chance of showers
after midnight, with lows in the 50s.

We've been hired
to protect said package...

66

until DOJ takes official custody.

67

All right, look alive, gentlemen.

Robert Daniels,

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,140
- I'll be damned. Jake Carter.
- Morning, Lieutenant.

73
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,402
Don't you salute me. I'll kick your ass.

74
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,409
I'm just a lowly civil servant now.

75
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,460
Never thought I'd see you
in a monkey suit, Jake.

76
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,246
- But I got to tell you, it looks ridiculous.
- Thank you, sir.

77
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,328
Let's go, Miss Tanis.

78
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,660
Where the hell are we?

79
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,003
You are back in the United States
of America. That's all that matters.

80
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,940
She still pissed?

81
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,860
She told us to keep our distance.

82
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,540
She's a little high-strung.

83
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,380
Took a swing at one of my guys
for telling her to relax.

84
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,020
Who is she?

85
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,380
Olivia Tanis, 24 years old.

86
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,060
She's smart. IQ, 135.

87
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,780
She's also a whistle-blower.

88
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,460
She's been
on the run overseas for weeks.

89
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,060
We caught up with her in Hong Kong.

90
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,460
Flew her into Vancouver this morning
and then hopped out here.

91
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,700
She's got intel on traitors
inside Genesis Defense Corporation,

92
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,260
where she used to work.

93
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,380
It's also one of the largest
defense contractors in the US.

94
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,084
Tanis worked as an IT engineer.

95
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,009
Says she has files
to back up her claims.

96
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,180
That's the info
she's trading for protection.

97
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,060
Locked away in some
encrypted cloud file only she knows.

98
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,940
That's why we have to keep Tanis off-book,
which is where you come in.

99
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,500
We take her into official custody,
she's in the system.

100
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,220
She's agreed to surrender the files
directly to the attorney general.

101
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,164
So your job is to babysit her
until we can set that up.

102
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,140
- MAN: We'll tag along until her drop.
- Hey.

103
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,860
- Then she's all yours.
- Okay. Done.

104
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,620
- Hey.
- What's the problem now?

105
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,291
You call these guys inconspicuous?
You might as well paint a target on my back.

106
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,820
Hawthorne Global is the best
in private security, Liv.

107
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,900
Yeah? This guy looks like he bought
his suit from Men's Wearhouse.

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,940
I'm trusting my life in people...

109
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,300
who can't even protect themselves
from lousy fashion choices?

110
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,100
Look, here's what I want, all right?

111
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,540
You're gonna give me
a burner phone and the AG's number.

112
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,780
In three days, I'll give you a where
and a when. Until then, I'm gone.

113
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,724
That's not gonna happen.
These guys will protect you.

114
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,805
Come on, Liv.

115
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,520
Protect her. Even from herself.

116
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,660
Yep. She's just a ray of sunshine
on a cloudy day.

117
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,364
Yeah, I can see that.

118
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,340
Well, beats chugging up those Afghan
mountain roads in the MRAPs,

119
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,522
- don't you think, Jake?
- Agreed.

120
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,140
- You ever settle down?
- Couldn't find a woman to put up with me yet.

121
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,660
Well, I'm not surprised.

122
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,020
You always were a pain in the ass.

123
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,860
So, how's Susan and the girls?
What are they, four and five now?

124
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,248
- Try seven and eight.
- Where does the time go, huh?

125
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,060
Hopefully they take after their mother.

126
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,242
Oh. Yeah, no, they did, luckily.

127
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,700
- So no one, huh?
- Nope.

128
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,700
What a surprise, with everything
that you clearly have to offer.

129
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,740
Let me guess.
You were a big deal in high school.

130
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,604
What was it?
Quarterback dating a prom queen?

131
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,540
- Running back, actually.
- Of course it was. What was I thinking?

132
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,940
I can see it now. Jakey boy's
gonna go off, win the Heisman,

133
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,900
go pro and become a big, big star.

134
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,100
Oops. Along came this
little thing called the SATs.

135
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,740
That's when you realize not all fairy tales
have happy endings, do they?

136
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,740
Am I wrong?

137
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,540
Fast-forward a couple years, and you're just
another rent-a-cop playing taxi driver.

138
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,620
Not bad, but I hate to break it to you.
SATs weren't really my problem.

139
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,900
Yeah? What was it then? Astonish me.

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,571
A little thing called 9/11.

141
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,300
- Permission to speak freely?
- MILLER: By all means.

142
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,500
This is the most entertained
I've been in days.

143
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,660
I think we're both just really impressed to
see you putting together full sentences here.

144
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,140
And I'm just trying
to put together what your story is.

145
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,340
While we're on the subject
of clichés here, I heard your bio.

146
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,900
Ivy League and all.
That means you come from money.

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,686
Right? So, what, you're the sweet,
little prep school princess...

148
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,420
that no one really understood?

149
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,140
The type that always got herself into one
fine mess after the other for attention.

150
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,449
Good thing you always had Daddy's
money to count on to bail you out.

151
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,403
At least until now, that is.

152
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,860
Yeah. This time it looks like you
finally found yourself...

153
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,770
in a situation you can't buy
your way out of.

154
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,043
- But what do I know? I'm just a taxi driver.
- That's enough, Carter.

166
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,209
We need to move!

00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,887
Shit.

168
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,127
They're flanking!

Oh, shit.

- Johnson. I got the girl coming your way.
- Roger that. We're on it.

Could use a little help here, Dawes.

172

Go on. Get it done.

They're moving!

174
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,967
I'll draw their fire. Peel around
in the forest and secure the package.

All clear!

176
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,161
Then what are you waiting for?
Get moving!

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,045
Come on.

182
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,042
We need to move. Come with me.

Get down!

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,609

- Go!

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,900
- Are you hit?
- It's not my blood.

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,002
- Jesus Christ! Who were those guys?
- I don't know.

196
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,826
Drop me off somewhere.
I'm better off on my own.

197
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:32,300
- You wouldn't last five minutes.
- Six weeks in Hong Kong, I was just fine.

198
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,380
Twenty minutes here,
I'm running in a forest getting shot at.

199
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,100
Did you call anyone from a plane?
Boyfriend? A girlfriend?

200
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,820
Seriously? No. No boyfriend
or girlfriend. I'm on my own.

201
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,900
All I have are the clothes
on my back. And now you.

202
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,525
They knew where to hit us.
Someone tipped them off.

203
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,529
- Then let's go to the police.
- No. We can't risk it.

204
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,740
For now, we'll go to the safe house.

205
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,365
With any luck, we got a head start.

206
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,448
- Luck? That's encouraging.
- We'll go to the safe house,

207
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,688
figure out our next move there.

208
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,482
Your boss said you were new. How new?

209
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,500
This is my first day.

210
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,204
Awesome.

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,685

- Planning for the worst.

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,220
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

216
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,300
I'll get you some water.

217
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,845
Don't move.

218
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,260
- What are you doing?
- Give me the keys.

219
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,362
Bad idea. Out there on your own,
you're too exposed.

220
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,100
- No, I'm going to the cops.
- Whoever ambushed us will have that covered.

221
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,500
I appreciate you saving my life,
but I don't know you.

222
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,700
I don't know anyone. In fact,
you guys have a rat in your company,

223
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,700
which means there's really
only one person that I can trust... me.

224
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,900
Give me the damn car keys.

225
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,490
I can't do that.

226
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,649
You think I won't blow
your head off right here?

227
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,900
Maybe.

228
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,300
My job is to protect you.

229
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,368
I give you the keys,
I'm not doing my job.

"Always faithful"?

232
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,500
So what, you're a marine?
Is that supposed to put my mind at ease?

233
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,060
Yeah, it should. But I don't
give a shit if it does or not.

234
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,926
We don't have time for this. So either
shoot me or let me do my damn job.

235
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,647
I won't let them get to you.

Yeah. Just one sec, please.

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,620
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah. I said give me a sec, all right?

246
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,768
Sorry. It's just...

247
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,962
We gotta get moving.

248
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,808
Is there anything to eat? I'm starved.

249
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,540
Eat up.

250
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,740
Yeah, that's not food.
I'm not eating that.

251
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,340
Is there anything organic?

252
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,780
Organic? There you go.

253
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,644
Get your stuff. We're leaving.

254
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,811
Get back in one of the rooms.
Don't come out unless I say so.

255
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,083
If anything happens,
get out of here and don't look back.

(BEEPING)

257
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,844
Drop it.

258
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,700
Jake.

259
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,326
I said drop it now.

260
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,170
Now!

261
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,380
Jake.

262
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,740
- Jake, what the hell is this?
- That's what I wanna know.

263
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,605
- Didn't think anyone made it out.
- No one else did.

264
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,780
Except you two.

265
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,180
After you and Tanis broke free, we found
an opportunity to get away, and we took it.

266
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,540
Yeah, we saw you drive away
with the girl. Good man.

267
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,260
Where'd you get the car?

268
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,020
We borrowed it from a very patriotic
redneck we stumbled across.

269
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,460
Look, Jake, I get it.

270
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,483
You don't know who to trust.

271
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,460
- Exactly.
- Okay.

272
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,980
But if I was dirty, I wouldn't
come back here with just one more gun.

273
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,969
I'd hit you hard.

274
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,100
I know who these guys are, okay?

275
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,009
Jake, it's me.

276
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,089
Can I put my hands down, please?

277
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,884
All right.

278
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,500
- Who are they?
- His name is Simon Vogel.

279
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,820
Former South African Special Forces.

280
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,380
We used to use him for odd jobs
when we couldn't afford the visibility.

281
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,020
Then he went... became unstable.

282
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,380
There was a job in Beirut. Things got
real messy, and we had to cut him loose.

283
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,005
I didn't even know he was still alive.

284
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,970
- His team?
- If it's the same crew he used to run with,

285
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,163
they're all former tier-one operators...
best money can buy.

286
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,620
How did he know our route?

287
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,460
Just like you suspect.
Someone tipped him off from the inside.

288
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,608
- Exactly.
- (GUN COCKS)

289
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,980

(GASPS)

291
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,127
Toss it.

00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,810
- And the sidearm.
- (PANTING)

293
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,369
Hey.

294
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,220
Where is she?

295
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,049
Not here.

296
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,685
Bullshit.

297
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,124
Move.

298
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,005
Keep moving.

299
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,844
Stand right there like a good boy.

300
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,522
I figured whoever was dirty
was gonna show up here.

301
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,370
So I stashed her.

302
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,329
Oh, is that so?

303
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,042
Move.

304
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,130
Into the kitchen.

305
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,325
Back there.

306
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,291
Satisfied?

307
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,725
Okay. I'll play. What do you want?

308
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,089
I don't negotiate against myself.

309
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,445
Give me a number.

310
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,249
You'd sell her out?

311
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,524
Just like that?

312
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,642
So I'll ask you again. What's she worth?

313
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,060
Here's your number.

314
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,640
Five, four,

315
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,140
- three, two...

This should have been easy.
You had the element of surprise.

Okay. Here's what I'm certain of.

338
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,928
The research they put
into making you disappear...

339
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,980
is an all-or-nothing type of move.

346
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,100
a bunch of troops in Afghanistan died
due to faulty body armor?

Remember? I was there.
Witnessed it firsthand.

You're saying that Genesis Defense
Corporation was behind that?

- Come on, Liv. I was lying to buy time.
- Maybe.

00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,260
I can't say the same.

471
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,180
I have to admit, I respect your skills.

472
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,020
But you died the moment
you put that suit on.

473
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,124
- Where's Olivia Tanis, Carter?
- Why don't you come take a look?

474
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,620
Oh, yeah, that's cute.

475
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,166
Only if you promise
not to run away this time.

476
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,860
Examine your situation.

477
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,940
You're pinned down and outgunned.

478
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,460
Tell us where she is, Carter,
and you can walk away from this.

479
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,820
You got maybe 10 minutes.
Backup's on the way.

480
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,809
You should think about your next move.

481
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,850
I just murdered a whole police station.
What's a few more?

482
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,780
Be smart, Carter. Give us the girl.

483
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if she's with Carter.

484
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,571
You're either in front of the gun
or behind it.

485
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,808
- You choose.

487
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,001
Get in!

488
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,767
Go, go, go, go!

489
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,405
Let's go! Let's go!

490
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,050
Go!

491
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,566
- So now what are we gonna do?
- Drive! Just drive!

492
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,481
Shit. Shit.

493
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,929
Get off the main road!

494
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,260
Here they come!
Move! Let's go! Move it!

495
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,885
Shit.

496
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,330
Run him down! Faster!

497
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,884
- Faster! Move it!
- Are you crazy? I can't...

498
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,961
Faster!

499
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,980
Jesus Christ! I want this guy!

500
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,889
- Faster!
- Christ!

501
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,287
- You're losing him.
- Come on, Grant!

502

(GRUNTS, GROANS)

00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,491
Are you okay?

00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,689
Let's go. Time to clean it up.

Here, take that. Take it.

00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,768
We gotta move. We gotta move. Let's go.

510
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,060
Grab your gear.

511
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,100
They've gone to ground.
We'll hunt them on foot.

512
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,100
Wait. Are you sure
that's the wisest move?

513
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,860
Carter's just turned the tables
in his favor.

514
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,964
He knows what he's doing.
That's why he went into the woods.

515
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,620
What options do we have, huh?

516
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,660
If you have any ideas, I'm all ears.

517
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,340
Hey, listen. We are dwindling numbers,
in case you haven't noticed.

518
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,500
We've got to regroup,
call in more muscle and go in at sunrise.

519
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,180
They are on foot
and will be blind when it gets dark.

520
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,620
They're not gonna get far.

521
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,802
You'll wanna lose this.

522
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,482
Hayes. Call Marcus. We're going
in first thing in the morning.

523
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,768
No, no. Let me help you.

(GROANS)

525
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,448
Sorry. I'm not a nurse.

526
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,120
- Told you to run back there.
- (EXHALES)

527
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,684
Something you should know
about me by now. I don't listen too well.

528
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,922
Can you pass me one of the clips?

529
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,888
- Thanks.
- You would have done the same.

530
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,805
Hey. I found this.
See if you can get a signal on it.

531

- (SNIFFLES)
- (BEEPING)

532
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,680
No, there's no signal,
but I'll keep trying.

533
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,004
I should have trusted you. I should
have just trusted you from the start.

534
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,327
- Hey.
- I walked into that police station.

535
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,124
- Don't.
- They're dead.

536
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,740
- That's on me.
- No.

537
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,580
It's on the people who sent
those bastards after you.

538
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,364
None of this is your fault.

539
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,881
Hey.

540
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,380
What are you doing?

541
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,484
This is an encrypted Web address
with my password.

542
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,180
It's everything that I know on Genesis.

543
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,282
It implicates
half the board of directors.

544
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,762
You're the only one that I've told.

545
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,060
You know,

546
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,685
just in case.

547
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,606
We're gonna be fine.

548
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,766
When this is over,
you're gonna get to watch them all burn.

549
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,811
(EXHALES)

550
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,580
So what now?

551
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,940
We keep moving until we get
a signal on that phone.

552
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,660
Our only play is contacting
the attorney general directly somehow.

553
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,500
How the hell do we do that?

554
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,170
I haven't figured that part out yet.

555
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,011
So what, we're just supposed
to die out here in the woods?

556
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,365
Did I say that?

557
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,009
We stop running.

558
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,687
Come on. Let's keep going.
We'll find a signal.

560
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,060

- (SIGHS)
- Okay.

563
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,900
So we've got the river in front of us
and the ridgeline all around us.

564
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,900
There's... five hours till sunrise.
That's when they're gonna come for us.

565
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,340
But then we're trapped,
and they know exactly where to find us.

566
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,967
That's what I'm hoping for. Come on.
We got a lot of work to do.

567
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,820
All right, Liv.
This is where we part ways.

568
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,763
Head that way towards the river
and follow it.

569
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,220
- Eventually you'll hit a road.
- No way. I'm safer with you.

570
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,041
- I don't wanna argue with you.
- Good. Then don't. Let's go.

571
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,922
Got more blood here.
They definitely came this way.

572
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,290
Dawes, you got anything?

573
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,140
Cops got nothing so far.

574
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,890
The whole area is still locked down.

575
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,060
Roadblocks, checkpoints, everything.

576
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,764
Everyone take a deep breath.

577
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,446
Let's take our time. Do this right.

578
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,420
(BUZZING)

579
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,180
- Is that Genesis?
- Yep.

580
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,805
What do they want?

581
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,162
For you to do your job.

582
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,642
Hayes, pick up the pace.

583
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,365
Hayes, which way?

584
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,970
Hayes.

585
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,540
Hayes.

586
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,220
I lost it.

588
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,850
Find it.

It's him. Channel two.

Vogel. Simon Vogel. Are you there?

592
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,288
- (WHISPERING) Can you track him?
- Yeah.

593
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,140
Carter. It's good to hear your voice.

594
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,340
Did you miss me?

595
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,380
Very much.

596
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,041
To think we were just
getting to know each other.

597
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,780
- Is the girl with you?
- Here's the thing, Simon.

598
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,660
She's not your problem anymore. I am.

599
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,460
I've noticed.

600
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,881
If I were you, I'd actually keep
an eye on Smith.

601
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,163
He's the sort that likes to shoot people
in the head when they're not looking.

602
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,300
Listen, Jake. We both know you're not
gonna make it out of this canyon.

603
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,563
- (BEEPING)
- So let's be frank with each other.

604
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,980
It's just a matter
of what the attrition rate will be.

605
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,460
Oh, you're good. I'll give you that.

606
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:22,380
And, ironically, you've opened up new
opportunities for recruitment on my team.

607
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,620
You're offering me a job?

608
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,300
Bring me the girl.

609
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,780
You get to live and get rich.

610
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,380
What do you say?

611
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,460
Thanks, but no, thanks.

612
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,580
It's not why I called.

Any sign of them at all?

- Are you ready?
- Of course not.

when you have to. Hit and run. Got it?

Yeah.

What makes you think Carter doesn't
have the rest of this valley rigged?

So, what's the plan, Vogel?

while you figure it out?
