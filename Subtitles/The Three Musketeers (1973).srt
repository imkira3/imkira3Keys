2
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:05,419
Only use it as a last resort.
When all else is failed.

3
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:12,469
- It has served me well, as you can see.
- Yes, father.

4
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,011
- Won't you sit down?
- No. Time is short.

5
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,970
You must be off.

6
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:23,179
I've given you my secret thrust.
I give you at least 15 crowns.

7
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,179
And this.

8
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,638
Your grandfather bought this
sword against the Moors of Lepanto.

9
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,680
I made some use of it.
Under the late King Henry.

10
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,013
Now it is yours.

11
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:41,222
It'll introduce you to Monsieur Treville,
who commands the King's musketeers.

12
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:47,011
He will remember it well.
And me.

13
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:52,765
My son, you're going
to be a musketeer.

14
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:57,432
You are young, brave and
a Gascon and a D'Artagnan.

15
00:03:57,433 --> 00:04:01,558
Fights, whenever you can.
Never submit to insults...

16
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:05,267
except from the King
and Cardinal Richelieu.

17
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:09,725
Now be weary of the Cardinal, for
he rules France through the King.

18
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:13,184
But you are a King's man, and the Queen.

19
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:15,559
So...

20
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:21,726
Now, go and say goodbye
to your mother.

21
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,352
Your ointment is in pack.
Rub it well to every scratches.

22
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:29,811
And dry your cloak and your
shoes well. / Yes, mother.

23
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:33,301
Goodbye.
Goodbye, father.

24
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:38,395
Don't sell the horse.
Let him die honorably of old age!

25
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,104
And fight, remember!

26
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:43,646
Take care.

27
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,268
Come on!

28
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:06,268
As someone probably rides
on a buttercup.

29
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,895
Perhaps it is a cheese with legs.

30
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,316
Tell me what you're laugh at.
Then we'll laugh together.

31
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,900
If you were a gentleman,
I would speak to you.

32
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:25,355
But I am speaking to you!

33
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:30,272
Turn, if you are a man!

34
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,736
He is a Gascon. /
Should I kill him? / No.

35
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:45,233
Put him on his ridiculous horse
and let him go.

36
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:02,113
No time to talk, My Lady.

37
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:06,155
The cardinal command you to England.
Let him know when the Duke is leaving.

38
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:09,447
- And then?
- Awaits his further commands.

39
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:13,698
And you? When shall I see you again?

40
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,198
You... You assassin!

41
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,273
I shall chastise you, Sir.

42
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,032
Forgive me, Madame.
But, I must kill your friend.

43
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,907
Are you not terrified?

44
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:29,699
Away, pumpkin!
You will hear from me.

45
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,944
He's very handsome.

46
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:44,651
Claude, pay the bill!

47
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:49,195
You...

48
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:42,661
Where is Monsieur Treville?
/ Upstairs. / Thank you.

49
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:48,000
I like the belt buckles.

50
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:52,833
I am a man of his money at
night spends precious shirts.

51
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,959
Or one's mistresses money.

52
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,584
No, my own.
I paid with 12 pistoles.

53
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:01,793
It is golden belt.

54
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:05,418
Astonishing! There's enough gold
in France to stretch so much?

55
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:11,794
Might I lift the cloak?
- No, I have a cold.

56
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,750
Discretion is being a part of vanity.

57
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:17,670
I don't understand.
I know the one about valor,

58
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:23,791
but in such clothing
I can not be prudent.

59
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:32,046
A very clean sword
thrust. A souvenir from...

60
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,921
the Cardinal's guard.
- You're a liar. It's a smallpox.

61
00:08:34,922 --> 00:08:41,541
If one sees... / Don't pretend you know
to make any difference to the treatment.

62
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,339
Monsieur Treville will see you now.

63
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,459
Thank you.

64
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:32,588
Your father says that
you carry his old sword.

65
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:36,008
Yes.

66
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:52,222
Do me the honor of taking one
arms, 'till yours grow longer.

67
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,139
Sir, I ask charity of no one.

68
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,426
Then you aren't likely to get it.

69
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:04,806
No, not charity, but love and courtesy
for the son of an old friend.

70
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:08,592
To keep his enemies further off.

71
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,129
In that case, sir.

72
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:13,054
I bid thank you.

73
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:17,641
That is as much as
I can offer you.

74
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:22,933
You see, there is no place in
the musketeers for any man...

75
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:27,596
untill he has serve in a campaign or
distinguish himself in the killing.

76
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:33,893
But, what I can do is write
a letter to Monsieur de Salle,

77
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:37,181
who commands the guards.

78
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:41,019
You coward! I spit on you!

79
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,727
What?

80
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:44,394
Not on you, Sir.

81
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,936
On that fellow, without the eye!

82
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:51,019
You, Sir! I said stop, Sir!

83
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:14,977
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry!
- You're certainly in a hurry.

84
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:19,188
You hurdled into me and
expect an excuse is sufficient?

85
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:23,065
You need a lesson in manners.

86
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,274
I said "excuse me".

87
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:27,768
I need no lesson in manners.

88
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,227
You shall have one anyway.

89
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,265
Where?

90
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:37,771
The Carmelite convent, at twelve.

91
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:53,277
- Gold all the way around.
- Stop! You run with your eyes shut!

92
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,735
- Sir, I beg your pardon.
- I demand satisfaction.

93
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,893
Where?
- At the Luxembourg, one o'clock.

94
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:11,107
Oh, look... at the statue.

95
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:13,650
Forgive me, gentlemen.

96
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:19,113
- You drop this.
- Gold departing from departing pansy!

97
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,946
That's not mine.

98
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:23,155
Pardon, I saw it fall.

99
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:26,655
You see too much,
it is a fault among peasant.

100
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:30,406
- I am a Gascon, Sir.
- And need to learn civilized behavior.

101
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:34,156
I am no bully, as a future priest
I fight only if I must.

102
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:37,365
But you have compromised a lady.

103
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:40,108
Shall we say at Hotel
Treville, two o'clock? / Sir!

104
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:43,571
Sir, your purse!

105
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:50,939
Well, if I'm to be killed, at
least by the hand of a musketeer.

106
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,618
You're punctual.

107
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:12,025
Even though you're not running.

108
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,286
But you did hurt my shoulder.

109
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:20,036
I trust it will not inconvenient you, Sir.
If you wish to postpone...

110
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:23,953
By all means. I fight just
as well with my left hand.

111
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:27,495
If you find this places you to
a disadvantage, I do apologize.

112
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,579
You're very courteous, Sir.

113
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,740
About your wound, I have
an ointment from my mother.

114
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:43,371
You overwhelmed me, young man.
Ah, here come my second.

115
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:48,915
You fight him? But I'm meeting him
myself. / Not 'till one o'clock, sir.

116
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:53,707
No, I do! / At two. / How
long you been in Paris?

117
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,749
- Since 8 o'clock this morning.
- You wasted no time.

118
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,705
My father recommended
that I fight duels.

119
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:08,456
Let us hope you can
do him some credits.

120
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:23,244
- The Cardinal's guard!
- Cease, quickly!

121
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:30,623
Ah, musketeers!
Dueling in defiance of the edicts.

122
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:34,920
This is a private matter.
Would you please be on your way.

123
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:37,420
We have a duty to suppress disorder...

124
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:41,212
...and arrest brawlers. Put up
your sword and come along with us?

125
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,544
Impossible. / Unthinkable. / Unlikely.

126
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:50,044
Then we must charge you.

127
00:14:55,256 --> 00:15:00,464
They are six and we are
only three. / No... four.

128
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:02,792
You are not one of us.

129
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:05,548
This is not your affair, boy.

130
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:09,464
I may not have the tunic, but I
have the heart of a musketeer!

131
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:18,000
Young man, you may retire.
Save your skin. And quickly.

132
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:26,259
What is your name?
/ D'Artagnan. / Well, then.

133
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,967
Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan!

134
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:32,545
Forward!

135
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,381
First, let us pray.

136
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:49,214
Gentle Jesus, meek and hard!

137
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:54,627
May I?

138
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:07,883
Sorry.

139
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:13,342
A sword!

140
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,180
For God's sake.

141
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,755
Thank you.

142
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:15,357
D'Artagnan!

143
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:19,225
No!

144
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:34,690
No! Leave him to me!

145
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:50,615
- Put down your sword!
- No!

146
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:53,532
Surrender, Biscart! I order you.

147
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,490
Oh, that's different.

148
00:18:57,491 --> 00:19:01,110
Ring the bell.
The nuns will tend to your wounded.

149
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:08,024
Come, the sooner we go, the
better. / Yes, it was over too soon.

150
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:18,034
Look at that best flemish velvet!
Ruined by you!

151
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:23,325
You will pay for it!
10 pistole it costs me!

152
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:30,869
No, 20 pistole. And 20 more as a fine,
to teach you manners!

153
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,828
Thief!

154
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:37,245
Charity is one of cardinal virtue!

155
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:41,954
Are we going to stand here and chat,
until marshal comes to arrest us? Go!

156
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:44,447
Let's be off.

157
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:47,871
About your friend's wounds...

158
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:52,534
I have an ointment from my mother.
You might find it effective...

159
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:08,364
I threw my sword in the air...
- Porthos! Porthos!

160
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,749
The purse, please. The Musketeers
motto: One for all and all for one.

161
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,958
Which loosely translate as 10 for him,
10 for him, 10 for you and 10 for me.

162
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:24,083
My dear Aramis needs 10,
to impress his mistress.

163
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:28,709
My good Porthos needs 10,
to enable himself to dress decently.

164
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,251
And you need 10 for
lodging and a servant.

165
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:36,622
- And I...
- And you?

166
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:39,293
I need a drink.

167
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:43,458
The future looks rosier
from the bottom of a glass.

168
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:47,634
Mind, where...

169
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,001
This is a horse?

170
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:05,928
This is the steps.

171
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:10,262
I think you'll like it here, monsieur.
For only two francs a day...

172
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:14,679
this chamber here... wonderful.

173
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,721
And scrupulously clean, as you see.

174
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:21,263
Slopped empty every second day.

175
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:24,972
And more redundant on a modest fee.

176
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:28,055
You're rascal can sleep out there.

177
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:33,181
If you beat him for insolence,
the scream will scarce be heard.

178
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:39,265
They don't fallof tree,
chamber like this in Paris.

179
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:45,054
Where else you get a
magnificent view of the city?

180
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:53,343
Honestly, this pig sty is not fit for...

181
00:22:55,518 --> 00:22:57,725
a king or cardinal.

182
00:22:57,726 --> 00:23:01,059
But it will suits me very well.

183
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,430
Two francs, you say?

184
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:10,388
You take it?
- Whenever it's offered.

185
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:14,935
My wife, sir!

186
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:18,978
Is she not beautiful?
- Enchanting.

187
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:25,134
Thank you. / She is as
delicate as petals falling...

188
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:29,020
From afar!

189
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:33,312
You know, my wife is the
dressmaker to the Queen.

190
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:37,271
A very nice person, the Queen.
My wife has her every confidence.

191
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:42,183
I am very proud of being her husband.

192
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:48,439
She lives here?
- No, I live here.

193
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,148
My beautiful Constance stays
at the palace. Where else?

194
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:55,857
She visited me once a week.

195
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:57,773
Tonight, in fact.

196
00:23:57,774 --> 00:24:01,726
Madame must look
forward to that eagerly.

197
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,145
Yes.

198
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:40,326
Faster!

199
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:43,781
Faster, you idiot!

200
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:50,244
Come on! Somebody, make it faster!

201
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:53,995
Wonderful! It is really wonderful.

202
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:57,366
I feel sick.

203
00:25:58,204 --> 00:26:04,739
The queen to king's knight 4.

204
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:21,123
Your ruffians have spite
the Cardinal's guard.

205
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:24,665
Your Musketeers, sire.
- Your ruffians.

206
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:30,370
Knight to king's bishop five

207
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,083
I am hard put to explain it to him,
who guards France while I sleep,

208
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:41,708
and works tirelessly while
I amused myself.

209
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:45,875
Your Majesty refers to God?
- I refer to Cardinal Richelieu,

210
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:48,583
which is not quite the same thing.

211
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:52,826
Oh, Cardinal...

212
00:26:56,378 --> 00:27:00,377
This matter of Treville's musketeers...

213
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:02,752
Broken heads and broken swords.

214
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:08,795
Trifles, Sire. The Duke of
Buckingham is in Paris.

215
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:11,962
Buckingham? Here?
Why, in God's name?

216
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,712
To plot against my honor?
- The Queen.

217
00:27:15,713 --> 00:27:20,296
You will arrest the plotter.
- Sire, you are off.

218
00:27:20,297 --> 00:27:25,838
The Queen is faithful to you and
to France. She loves you warmly.

219
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,797
I am not scorched by the heat.
You arrest him.

220
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:34,797
What a scandal should we do that?
Arrest the prime minister of England?

221
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,006
No, Sire. What we must do is
keep the noble Duke on a string,

222
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:42,423
to pursue his sordid
pact with Protestants

223
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:44,965
his politics muffled in a cloak.

224
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:49,424
And the Queen muffled in
her cloak, under the window?

225
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:53,258
Her majesty beauty attracts
all manners of worship...

226
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:55,508
and worshippers.

227
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:59,008
But her virtue is beyond question.

228
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:03,292
As for the Duke of Buckingham,
he will be watched.

229
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:16,218
Bishop to queen two.

230
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:25,299
Chess.

231
00:28:50,223 --> 00:28:52,716
That one.

232
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:05,307
Open up! Open up!

233
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:09,342
Or else, we break it down!

234
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:23,301
Don't worry, Constance!
- Oh, my darling!

235
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:38,019
You will come with me.
- No, I won't.

236
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,811
No, I won't.

237
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,471
We'll see about that.

238
00:29:47,438 --> 00:29:49,717
We'll see about that.

239
00:29:55,689 --> 00:30:02,769
You will come with me.
- Yes, I... I'll come with you.

240
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:33,686
Stop her! Stop her!

241
00:30:38,444 --> 00:30:41,150
What have you done with my wife?

242
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:14,402
Monsieur D'Artagnan, I want you... / I'm
yours, as soon as I get my breathe back.

243
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,322
Did I hurt you?

244
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:23,781
Monsieur, I must get to the queen tonight.
- I can not allow it.

245
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:27,948
I was torn from my bed.
- The best place for you.

246
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:31,983
The bed is the best place for you.

247
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,699
Sit down.

248
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,533
Thank you, Monsieur.

249
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:39,199
- Oh! My husband.
- Where?

250
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,440
In the Bastille.

251
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:46,486
Oh, a... I'm sorry.

252
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:52,068
Now, the best possible course is a good
night sleep. Try to forget about it.

253
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:57,327
I can not sleep, with my
husband in the Bastille.

254
00:31:57,328 --> 00:32:00,660
- I'm frightened.
- I'm not.

255
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:05,411
You want to sleep with me. You need a
good cuddle to chase the fright away.

256
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:08,994
I must go to Her Majesty.
She needs me urgently.

257
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:13,453
I can not let you go.
The streets are full of dangers,

258
00:32:13,454 --> 00:32:16,492
and your legs and
feet are dirty.

259
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:21,033
Yes.

260
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:26,996
You must help me. You are young
and gallant. My husband is weak

261
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:31,446
troubled with wind.
Can I tell you?

262
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:37,414
Can I trust you? / With your
life which beats in your breast.

263
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:41,498
I hear the flutter of life
like a little white bird.

264
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:44,915
I must be the queen.
- I can hear the wings.

265
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:48,124
The Cardinal wishes to ruined it.
Because I'm in the Queen's confidence..

266
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,166
Perhaps he hopes to
attack her through me.

267
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:54,583
You can not go to the
Queen with dirty legs.

268
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:56,083
No.

269
00:32:56,084 --> 00:33:00,667
Are you strong enough to wash them?
- No.

270
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:06,167
My poor husband, without
him I feel so helpless.

271
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:08,834
I have never washed
the legs of a woman.

272
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:13,830
I have done a horse.
With the horse, you start at the top.

273
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:18,294
I can not go dirty to the Queen.

274
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:22,791
Do you think I will be safe here?

275
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:26,663
Oh yes, Constance, yes...

276
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:32,087
Oh, it's...

277
00:33:33,838 --> 00:33:37,244
...a bit cold.

278
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:52,673
At least let me escort you part
of the way. / No, I must go alone.

279
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:56,256
I have to meet someone before
I go to the queen. / Who?

280
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:58,923
Are you jealous so soon?

281
00:33:58,924 --> 00:34:02,294
Of every inch of you.

282
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:08,252
I must go now. Promise you won't follow.

283
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,081
Ouch!

284
00:34:41,054 --> 00:34:46,048
Money for the blind man.
You all right, darling?

285
00:34:48,763 --> 00:34:54,053
Money for a cripple...

286
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,180
Get off!

287
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:01,347
Money for a cripple!

288
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:05,216
Not your day, is it?
- Money for an orphan!

289
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:32,475
Money for a war veteran.

290
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,848
Money...

291
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:58,681
Before you climb out...

292
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:03,812
Sir, you have some change?

293
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,563
One moment, sir.

294
00:36:08,564 --> 00:36:12,980
But you promised.
- I can see why you make me promised.

295
00:36:12,981 --> 00:36:17,564
You have nothing to do with me.
- No, but with this lady.

296
00:36:17,565 --> 00:36:20,639
Take my arm. Good evening, sir.

297
00:36:22,023 --> 00:36:27,398
In God's name, my lord.
- My lord? Are you...

298
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,398
The Duke of Buckingham.

299
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:34,899
See? You will spoil everything!
- My darling, forgive me.

300
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:41,482
My Lord, what can I say?
I love her and was jealous.

301
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:45,275
A perfectly excellent reason for
attacking a stranger in the dark.

302
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:47,275
Woud you oblige me with a small matter?

303
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:50,317
Anything, my lord.
- When we enter the palace,

304
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:52,234
we must not be seen.

305
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:56,318
If anyone try to follow us, would you
be good enough to kill him. Thank you.

306
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:59,642
Oh, yes... yes.

307
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:35,739
Does Your Grace know of any private
place which as private as this public one?

308
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,655
- Well...
- Wait here!

309
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:57,700
Anne. / Why have you come?
/ To see you.

310
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:02,325
Oh, it is folly.
The king suspects...

311
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:05,367
and the Cardinal knows.
He'll ruin me.

312
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:11,326
His spies are... what if they caught us?
- Decidedly we must not be found,

313
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:13,993
not with the dirty laundry is washed.

314
00:38:13,994 --> 00:38:17,035
It's hopeless.
I'm the wife of the king.

315
00:38:17,036 --> 00:38:21,619
An ill mannered little Parisian lout to
ignored you, & jealous at the same time?

316
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,536
What do you owe him?

317
00:38:24,537 --> 00:38:28,571
I will not disgrace him.

318
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:31,743
Which is why I ask you to go

319
00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:34,745
and not to return.

320
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:38,287
We are not ordinary folk.
- Indeed.

321
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:41,288
It thrust both ways.

322
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:45,372
I am no little gentleman or a farm boy.

323
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:48,497
I am a master of a great state, Anne.

324
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:53,247
With great ships and
armies, too, if need be.

325
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,831
The English have come to France before.

326
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:58,706
But never with a better
reason than I have.

327
00:38:58,707 --> 00:39:02,990
Do you think I would
fret for a war to win you?

328
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:09,245
If you doubt it, wait 'till France
claim to the throne of England raises.

329
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:12,583
Dear, dear Anne...

330
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:15,500
You look lovelier than...

331
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:18,741
...than everything I've seen
in a laundry before.

332
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:25,074
Tell me again,
that you love me.

333
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:30,793
You must go.

334
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,044
It's not safe here.

335
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:40,039
It will be one day.
Until then...

336
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:44,086
Give me something to remember you by.

337
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:46,003
A token, anything.

338
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:50,453
Oh, come. A farm boy
sweetheart would give him one.

339
00:39:58,381 --> 00:40:01,797
These are my best things.

340
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:06,294
Within a year I will
bring them back to you.

341
00:40:18,508 --> 00:40:22,625
So, that's how they do it!

342
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:29,163
At no notion, I should wear my shirt
in the future with more respect.

343
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:33,967
Oh, God!

344
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:36,301
Go on! Quickly!

345
00:40:36,302 --> 00:40:39,043
Stand still!

346
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:54,503
In here!

347
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:06,668
Excuse me!

348
00:41:19,348 --> 00:41:22,801
Please tell me where are we going...

349
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:38,884
Dance, you rabbit! I'm not
through with you! Come here!

350
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:16,347
Oh, thank you.

351
00:42:23,522 --> 00:42:25,849
Come on!

352
00:43:32,863 --> 00:43:34,320
Oh, my lord.

353
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:39,446
I probably could've manage, but
my thanks to you gentlemen, anyway.

354
00:43:39,905 --> 00:43:43,988
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

355
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:48,189
But he sounded a touch of foreign to me.

356
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:59,275
Look at this? What on
earth was this all about?

357
00:43:59,616 --> 00:44:01,740
In you go.
- I want you tell me,

358
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:07,116
I did nothing. I was lying in bed, alone
when suddenly he break into my room.

359
00:44:07,117 --> 00:44:10,658
I swear I've done nothing!
What will they do to me?

360
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:14,325
You are in the Bastille.
You must have done something.

361
00:44:14,326 --> 00:44:18,857
What you have done is high treason.

362
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:26,368
You are accused of conspiring with
your wife and the Duke of Buckingham.

363
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:28,992
No, no...

364
00:44:29,077 --> 00:44:32,364
Do you know your accuser?

365
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:35,443
Who brought you here?

366
00:44:37,036 --> 00:44:40,077
That is the man!

367
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:42,619
Take him away.
- That is not the man!

368
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,737
There's another man. This is
a very honorable gentleman...

369
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:56,121
They have met, the Queen and
Buckingham. / Where? / At the Palace.

370
00:44:56,122 --> 00:45:00,413
I learned too late. / He slipped
through your finger? / Through yours.

371
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:05,122
I had no orders. / What happen? /
Madame Bonacieux accompanied Buckingham.

372
00:45:05,123 --> 00:45:09,081
I told you to arrest and hold her.

373
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:12,956
I failed.
One does occasionally.

374
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:17,582
If I blundered as you do,
my head would fall.

375
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:20,241
I would say, from a
greater height than mine.

376
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,249
You would?

377
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:26,532
The height of ambition.
/ You have none? / No.

378
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:30,289
Do you fear me?

379
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:34,708
Yes, I fear you, Eminence.

380
00:45:35,418 --> 00:45:38,954
I also hate you.

381
00:45:39,793 --> 00:45:44,539
I love you, son.
Even when you fail.

382
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:03,837
The queen gave Buckingham
the 12 diamonds studs.

383
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,379
The King gave her for her birthday.
Where went Buckingham, I do not know.

384
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,705
Spare me, not what you know.
Buckingham will be in Calais...

385
00:46:14,256 --> 00:46:17,744
We let him go this time.

386
00:46:19,214 --> 00:46:25,548
No... no... not break!

387
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:29,754
Let me go, please! Stop it!

388
00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:33,882
It hurts!

389
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:35,965
It supposed to.

390
00:46:35,966 --> 00:46:40,712
You have deceived me!

391
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,675
Deceived me!

392
00:46:45,676 --> 00:46:50,966
For thinking of you were a traitor.
Rise, my friend.

393
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:54,967
What can I say?

394
00:46:54,968 --> 00:46:59,749
I find that our suspicion
about you were entirely unjust.

395
00:46:59,844 --> 00:47:03,968
The Cardinal has taken my
hand and called me "friend".

396
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:09,136
We must make you a better man
than that. Take these 100 pistoles...

397
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:13,136
And forgive me.
- I forgive Your Eminence?

398
00:47:13,137 --> 00:47:17,254
You can not mean that, I
mean, what am I? I am nothing.

399
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:21,048
I am less than nothing.

400
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,971
Friend, you are generous.

401
00:47:25,972 --> 00:47:31,971
Is not it? I hope you will
come to visit me again,

402
00:47:31,972 --> 00:47:35,924
so that we can talk.
Until our next meeting.

403
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,723
I think I have done all
that can be done with him.

404
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:48,220
I set him loose to spy on his wife.
- He think I was frightened of him?

405
00:47:48,724 --> 00:47:56,634
The gallant Buckingham will most
certainly wear those diamonds studs.

406
00:48:05,768 --> 00:48:10,309
Send word to Milady de Winter in
England. She is to get close to him...

407
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,643
and obtain two of the studs.

408
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:17,477
You go there to meet her and see that
she brings them to me immediately.

409
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:22,637
How she gets them, is her affair.

410
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:19,309
You'll like this place.
It's very cheap.

411
00:49:31,986 --> 00:49:35,193
Wait a minute.
I can win some money for us.

412
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:37,485
He's the one!

413
00:49:37,486 --> 00:49:41,569
He will win!

414
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:46,445
Come on, boy!
- Then it's not enough for dinner.

415
00:49:46,446 --> 00:49:49,188
I'm going to win here!

416
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,606
He's the one!

417
00:50:09,823 --> 00:50:13,028
I am starved.

418
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:30,116
How about chicken? Always popular
on Wednesday. / It's Tuesday.

419
00:50:30,117 --> 00:50:35,783
Chops? / Oh, how revolting!
I long for good food.

420
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:39,273
Tell him to cook this, will you?

421
00:50:52,411 --> 00:50:54,406
You great overgrown child!

422
00:52:19,171 --> 00:52:24,628
I know what you are doing.
People like you, I know!

423
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:39,994
All right?

424
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,911
This should cover the
inconvenience, Sir.

425
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:44,137
Oh, look at its feathers!

426
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:47,634
Did you hear it cry?

427
00:54:12,225 --> 00:54:16,058
Have you heard?
His Eminence wants to see you dance.

428
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:19,808
He suggest that I give
a Ball in your honor.

429
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:24,350
What pleases your majesty is a delight
to me. / So, at the Hôtel de Ville then.

430
00:54:24,351 --> 00:54:29,893
In two weeks. We should be merry.
Ball, Ballet, Costumes

431
00:54:29,894 --> 00:54:32,726
and figures and whatever.

432
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:36,761
And you'll be able to wear the
diamonds studs that I gave you.

433
00:54:38,186 --> 00:54:41,640
That will crown her majesty's evening.

434
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,811
The diamonds studs?

435
00:54:43,812 --> 00:54:48,436
Yes, the studs, my
present to you. Why not?

436
00:54:48,437 --> 00:54:52,270
Do not you, that they are you? / Yes.

437
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:55,854
Yes, they are beautiful.
- Then I wish they're worn, then?

438
00:54:55,855 --> 00:55:00,636
I wish you to wear them.
I depend upon it, madame.

439
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:11,647
This bird has got a grip on me.

440
00:55:11,648 --> 00:55:17,315
It brought tears to my eyes,
clinged to my wrist. See?

441
00:55:17,316 --> 00:55:23,190
Oh, the ball with the diamonds...
You want to see the Queen's dance.

442
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:28,524
You becoming a romantic
under your priestly robe.

443
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,316
Even a cardinal has
weaknesses, your Majesty.

444
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:35,983
Whereas the king has
none, eh? See the tears?

445
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:42,067
This conversation took place in the
bedroom of Bonacieux at the palace.

446
00:55:42,068 --> 00:55:44,443
The Queen said:
"I am lost, I am lost".

447
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:48,443
Bonacieux said: "Your Majesty."
"Constance, I am lost."

448
00:55:48,444 --> 00:55:51,402
"Your Majesty."
"What can I do?"

449
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:58,518
"We can get the studs back". / "In
14 days? From London? I am lost".

450
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:05,862
"A messenger can reach London and
return to Paris with the studs".

451
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:11,529
"A messenger, who? I can trust no one.
That devil has informants everywhere.

452
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:15,529
That evil, filthy, revolting,
wretched man. Evil, filthy,

453
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:20,359
revolting, evil man, calls
himself a man of the church".

454
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:24,861
According to this.

455
00:56:24,906 --> 00:56:28,072
I will find a messenger, Majesty.

456
00:56:28,073 --> 00:56:30,698
I trust upon him. I swear it.

457
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:34,573
He can carry a letter from
you to Lord Buckingham.

458
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:38,489
Yes, a letter.

459
00:56:38,658 --> 00:56:41,565
I shall write it.

460
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:46,824
It's for my honor
and for my life.

461
00:56:46,825 --> 00:56:51,026
You've someone you can trust with that?
/ Your Majesty, he will not fail...

462
00:56:54,118 --> 00:56:56,826
The Queen is in danger...

463
00:56:56,827 --> 00:57:00,201
...unless this letter can be
taken immediately to London.

464
00:57:00,202 --> 00:57:04,576
If you could set out at once.
She has no one to trust but me.

465
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:07,702
And I can't trust no one but you.

466
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:10,160
Letters, dangers...

467
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:13,744
Come to bed,
Constance, my small chicken.

468
00:57:13,745 --> 00:57:16,161
And I will...

469
00:57:16,162 --> 00:57:19,578
I'll do anything you ask if
you promise to take the letter.

470
00:57:19,579 --> 00:57:24,495
What do I know about letters? I've been
so many days and nights without you.

471
00:57:24,496 --> 00:57:26,954
No, I'm serious...
- You think I'm not?

472
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:30,538
The letter must go to London now.
/ It must because you say so...

473
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:33,580
I don't wish to be trusted me...

474
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:39,369
because that suspicious
letter smacks of intrigue.

475
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,331
Constance, Constance...

476
00:57:43,332 --> 00:57:44,873
Yes, intrigue.

477
00:57:44,874 --> 00:57:50,540
What came out here?
I was dragged to the Bastille.

478
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:54,082
But I don't wish to be
sent to the Bastille,

479
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:57,332
because they got very deep dungeons
and terrible instruments of torture,

480
00:57:57,333 --> 00:58:00,291
operated by very unsympathetic men.

481
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:03,541
They slit very important
parts of people.

482
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:06,375
Hadn't been for the Cardinal...

483
00:58:06,376 --> 00:58:09,834
The Cardinal?
- Yes, the Cardinal.

484
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:14,459
You think, you alone have friends
in high places. Let me tell you...

485
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:18,210
The Cardinal took my
hand and called me friend.

486
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:22,752
And he gave me this purse.

487
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:27,044
You were the cardinal?
- I tell you something else.

488
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,747
He doesn't like this kind of intrigue.

489
00:58:31,587 --> 00:58:35,170
To whom is that the letter go?

490
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:37,420
It's nothing to you if you
do not wish to carry it.

491
00:58:37,421 --> 00:58:40,545
Very well, madam mischief.

492
00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:44,713
If you don't wish to go to bed with me,
I shall have to leave you.

493
00:58:44,714 --> 00:58:48,202
For a very important appointment.

494
00:58:57,132 --> 00:59:00,206
For a very important appointment!

495
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,633
- Oh, you!
- Me.

496
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:19,133
Then you heard? / Every
word. / Then you know.

497
00:59:19,134 --> 00:59:23,467
You and the Queen, you need
someone who is gallant, courageous,

498
00:59:23,468 --> 00:59:26,842
discreet, active, smart and loyal is.

499
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:29,926
I also know the way to London...

500
00:59:29,927 --> 00:59:33,635
and your good husband, whose
probably on his way to the Cardinal,

501
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,792
has thoughtfully provided my expenses.

502
00:59:38,428 --> 00:59:43,043
- Can I trust you?
- Trust me?

503
00:59:44,095 --> 00:59:47,428
Trust me? Oh, the question!

504
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:50,428
You can trust me because I love you.

505
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:54,961
And you love me. If not,
there's something wrong with you.

506
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:59,054
You must swear never to reveal the
name of the person to whom it goes.

507
00:59:59,055 --> 01:00:01,169
On my honor.

508
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,263
His name is the Duke of Buckingham.

509
01:00:04,264 --> 01:00:06,180
This way, sir!

510
01:00:06,181 --> 01:00:09,302
He moves quickly, that husband of yours!

511
01:00:25,085 --> 01:00:27,459
...happened all the time.

512
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:31,245
Constance! Constance!

513
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:34,127
She's gone.

514
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:38,877
As you might've known, you're an
imbecile, and not accept the letter.

515
01:00:38,878 --> 01:00:41,753
She has doubtly fled to the palace.

516
01:00:41,754 --> 01:00:46,253
None here. The candle is still warm.
- Quick to the palace!

517
01:00:46,254 --> 01:00:48,628
She can't be gone far.

518
01:00:48,629 --> 01:00:52,420
This letter, have your wife mentioned...

519
01:00:52,421 --> 01:00:56,254
the Duke of Buckingham?
- No, no names.

520
01:00:57,214 --> 01:01:03,037
This D'Artagnan lodges
with you, does he not?

521
01:01:03,631 --> 01:01:09,454
We shall find a lodging for D'Artagnan
& his friends as a precautions.

522
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:14,256
In the Bastille.
- And afterwards?

523
01:01:14,257 --> 01:01:18,090
In the Bastille
there is no "Afterwards".

524
01:01:33,426 --> 01:01:35,670
What?

525
01:01:41,218 --> 01:01:46,968
That man has insulted me,
broke my father's sword,

526
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:52,177
had me club to the ground and laid
violent hands on the woman I love.

527
01:01:53,178 --> 01:01:57,344
He is... inconvenient.

528
01:01:57,345 --> 01:02:02,136
Let me tell you something about this,
"inconvenient" gentleman of yours.

529
01:02:02,137 --> 01:02:04,844
His name is Rochefort.

530
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:08,054
He's the the Cardinal's
living blade and he's deadly.

531
01:02:08,055 --> 01:02:11,092
Now running already,
you slow oaf!

532
01:02:15,014 --> 01:02:17,756
15:0.

533
01:02:17,764 --> 01:02:20,043
Still 15th

534
01:02:30,682 --> 01:02:33,341
15 both.

535
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:48,142
30:15.

536
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:51,809
If you see Rochefort on the street,

537
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,809
do not make the effort,
to greet him.

538
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,512
Aramis! What the hell are you doing?

539
01:03:00,769 --> 01:03:05,643
Your only chance.
- A full risk.

540
01:03:05,644 --> 01:03:10,561
Rochefort or not, I have to
get to London with this letter.

541
01:03:10,562 --> 01:03:15,561
For the Queen. I must be back
with the answer in 14 days.

542
01:03:15,562 --> 01:03:19,514
With Cardinal's friend hunting
you, you won't get five miles.

543
01:03:22,105 --> 01:03:26,103
Game. Final set.

544
01:03:28,522 --> 01:03:30,979
You want this letter delivered?

545
01:03:33,814 --> 01:03:37,931
If the four of us go,
it should get there.

546
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:42,606
There goes tomorrow's dinner, sir.

547
01:03:42,607 --> 01:03:46,398
Wager on a Huguenot for Papacy
than on you two. Get your things.

548
01:03:46,399 --> 01:03:50,023
We're riding to London.
- London?

549
01:03:50,024 --> 01:03:52,857
Great lump of bollock indeed?

550
01:03:52,858 --> 01:04:00,057
Your soul is corrupted. You shall
not inherite the kingdom of God.

551
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:02,775
- When do we leave?
- At once.

552
01:04:02,776 --> 01:04:05,775
How do we get horses?
- We sell our servants.

553
01:04:05,776 --> 01:04:09,317
A servant sells his secrets,
Gentleman one before.

554
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:12,901
If one of us falls,
take the other three the letter.

555
01:04:12,902 --> 01:04:15,860
Who falls, must take his chances.
Agreed?

556
01:04:15,861 --> 01:04:19,985
No one asked delicately the cause
in which we're being expected to die?

557
01:04:19,986 --> 01:04:24,569
When on a campaign, does the king gives
his reason? If we have to fight, we fight.

558
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:29,611
Then let's go & be killed as we're
told. Is life worth so many questions?

559
01:05:05,533 --> 01:05:12,449
Be careful with the bridle!
Has cost more than you deserve.

560
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:18,325
I'll go, sir. / God be with
you, sir! / And you, too.

561
01:05:18,326 --> 01:05:21,033
- We toast, sir?
- With pleasure.

562
01:05:21,034 --> 01:05:23,658
Will you drink to
health of the Cardinal?

563
01:05:24,827 --> 01:05:29,159
Gladly, if you drink
with us on the king.

564
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,198
Not on the king.
On the Cardinal.

565
01:05:32,286 --> 01:05:34,826
You're drunk, sir.

566
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:38,029
There's only one answer for that.

567
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:42,655
This you will owe me one!

568
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:49,448
This is your folly. Kill the fellow
and follow us as soon as you can.

569
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:26,079
Come on!

570
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:31,041
We are down to three. / Porthos
can take him out. The guy's drunk.

571
01:06:31,042 --> 01:06:34,709
He looks sober enough
when he came en guard.

572
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:19,999
Damn! Look here!

573
01:07:48,176 --> 01:07:51,332
Stop! Stop!

574
01:09:01,559 --> 01:09:04,100
Get away! Ride out!

575
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:07,338
Come on!

576
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:42,634
Come on!

577
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:50,895
Drop it!

578
01:10:15,442 --> 01:10:19,316
The same fate awaits us
perhaps ten miles further.

579
01:10:19,317 --> 01:10:23,683
But at least we should be
safe enough to run. Forward!

580
01:10:34,194 --> 01:10:36,860
Treason it may be,

581
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:40,527
But I will retain the beauty of
French women above all others.

582
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:44,976
An Englishman can never believe you.

583
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,570
Go to bed, Felton!

584
01:10:48,571 --> 01:10:55,650
This expression could every
man prepare nightmares.

585
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:34,408
I can take anyone if you
have pass from the Cardinal.

586
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:36,617
I have a pass.

587
01:11:36,618 --> 01:11:39,200
This morning that no one should leave

588
01:11:39,201 --> 01:11:42,992
without the signature of
the Mayor master builder.

589
01:11:42,993 --> 01:11:46,118
Very well.
I'll be back in an hour.

590
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:49,572
Keep a close watch. Enemies of
the state were trying to escape.

591
01:12:02,871 --> 01:12:04,953
You could do me a favor, sir.

592
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:10,825
That pass in your pocket. Hand it over,
save us a great deal of inconvenient.

593
01:12:11,163 --> 01:12:13,871
You were the Gascon
rascall with a yellow horse,

594
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:17,121
on the streets with the musketeers
rumlungert corners and beating.

595
01:12:17,122 --> 01:12:21,455
The street corners you've been
careful to avoid, Monsieur Cyclops.

596
01:12:21,456 --> 01:12:24,705
Where are your three accomplices?

597
01:12:24,706 --> 01:12:28,076
You would've done been better...

598
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:38,955
It's me!

599
01:14:07,718 --> 01:14:11,123
Don't worry, sir. I'm coming.

600
01:14:28,803 --> 01:14:31,083
I'm coming!

601
01:14:37,054 --> 01:14:39,677
I've told you.

602
01:14:39,971 --> 01:14:42,887
Monsieur, are you killed?

603
01:14:42,888 --> 01:14:45,381
Not quite.

604
01:14:46,347 --> 01:14:48,888
Just a scrape along the ribs.

605
01:14:48,889 --> 01:14:53,097
Oh, Father! What you
almost did to your son.

606
01:14:53,098 --> 01:14:55,840
Is he dead?

607
01:14:56,098 --> 01:15:00,514
Alas, he's only stunned.
Shall I kill him?

608
01:15:00,515 --> 01:15:04,765
Certainly not.
Ties his wrists and gag him.

609
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:09,132
We give him the chance to bleed to
death, but we're not murdering him.

610
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:17,766
The pass is only for one.
- I am only one.

611
01:15:17,767 --> 01:15:22,263
- That is a servant.
- Okay.

612
01:15:38,519 --> 01:15:41,012
You alright?

613
01:15:45,228 --> 01:15:49,476
Look, will you? Dover!

614
01:16:39,068 --> 01:16:41,016
My lord!

615
01:16:48,985 --> 01:16:52,439
So, it's the jealous lover.

616
01:16:52,736 --> 01:16:56,604
I trust you haven't come to England
to fasten another quarrel on me?

617
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,114
I'm afraid I can not read.

618
01:17:28,115 --> 01:17:31,823
How long have you been on the road?
- Six days, my lord.

619
01:17:31,824 --> 01:17:34,156
Then so, we must bustle!

620
01:17:34,157 --> 01:17:38,404
Come on, Plachet, we must bustle.

621
01:17:38,533 --> 01:17:42,235
Oh, good. I like bustling.

622
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:45,570
Go, sir! At the gallop!

623
01:18:07,703 --> 01:18:11,026
One, two...

624
01:19:08,834 --> 01:19:10,583
Yes, sir.

625
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:13,706
She is my deity.

626
01:19:14,752 --> 01:19:17,584
Here they are.

627
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:20,955
I hoped to keep them always.

628
01:19:21,336 --> 01:19:26,044
God in heaven, two are missing!
/ What? / Let me think.

629
01:19:26,045 --> 01:19:29,836
I had all twelve at the
ball two weeks ago...

630
01:19:29,837 --> 01:19:32,086
Countess de Winter.

631
01:19:32,087 --> 01:19:33,794
My God!

632
01:19:33,795 --> 01:19:37,498
A pretty price for the infidelity.

633
01:19:37,629 --> 01:19:40,587
You should be in France by now.

634
01:19:40,588 --> 01:19:42,915
Felton!

635
01:19:54,881 --> 01:19:59,422
They had been stolen
by a Cardinal's spy!

636
01:19:59,423 --> 01:20:02,381
Felton, my secretary!
I want to place an order.

637
01:20:02,382 --> 01:20:06,465
Someone got a pen?
Write to all ports on the canal!

638
01:20:06,466 --> 01:20:10,007
No vessels to sail without my order!
If the king asks, tell him I'm...

639
01:20:10,008 --> 01:20:13,549
thinking of war with France.
And keep the road to Dover clear!

640
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,882
Six days?

641
01:20:15,883 --> 01:20:19,966
You shall kill yourself return
this studs to Queen in time.

642
01:20:19,967 --> 01:20:26,123
But the missing ones? / O'Reilly, put
a price on these, each one. Their worth?

643
01:20:30,343 --> 01:20:33,968
Something is missing... and there.

644
01:20:33,969 --> 01:20:39,260
I'd say... 500 pounds.

645
01:20:39,261 --> 01:20:42,548
How long to make two of them?

646
01:20:45,762 --> 01:20:50,136
A week? / I'll pay 5,000 each, if
they're finish the day after tomorrow.

647
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:54,428
Done. Could I tell my
wife, I'm not coming home?

648
01:20:54,429 --> 01:20:59,554
I'll do better. Jackson, a carriage and
escort of cavalry for Mrs. O'Reilly..

649
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:03,636
Prepare room for them.
- Oh, how nice.

650
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:18,505
Have you hurt yourself?
- It's nothing.

651
01:21:39,976 --> 01:21:43,891
Beautiful, beautiful.

652
01:21:44,435 --> 01:21:47,893
Would it be a compliment
to say they match your eyes?

653
01:21:47,894 --> 01:21:49,601
Unusually gallantry.

654
01:21:49,602 --> 01:21:52,851
Your normal humour, would be
to compare them to my heart.

655
01:21:52,852 --> 01:21:54,893
It did occur to me.

656
01:21:54,894 --> 01:21:59,723
Up the Cardinal,
down the Queen.

657
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,688
Whip it!

658
01:22:26,689 --> 01:22:31,766
There, sir. Pick out O'Reilly's
two new ones if you can.

659
01:22:32,357 --> 01:22:36,856
And now, for the honor of the
great lady whom we both serve...

660
01:22:36,857 --> 01:22:39,815
...is for you to see that
she receive them in time.

661
01:22:39,816 --> 01:22:43,190
My lord, it is done already.
- And you, sir.

662
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,768
How can I ever repay you?

663
01:22:46,358 --> 01:22:49,233
Let us understand one another...

664
01:22:49,234 --> 01:22:52,066
You are an Englishman,
an enemy of France.

665
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:55,900
You owe me nothing yet,
I did it for the Queen.

666
01:22:55,901 --> 01:22:59,359
And for another who is dear
to me as the Queen is to you.

667
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,315
I take my leave.

668
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:16,777
I forgot that England is
an island. How do I get off?

669
01:23:16,778 --> 01:23:21,642
You'll find fresh horses, and a clear
road to Dover, and waits for a ship.

670
01:23:22,654 --> 01:23:28,529
Monsieur, you would take
no reward from a friend.

671
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:32,481
Will you at least accept this?

672
01:23:32,655 --> 01:23:36,440
And this, from an enemy.

673
01:23:37,406 --> 01:23:40,064
That is different.

674
01:23:44,448 --> 01:23:47,320
I'm tired!
- Me too. We're almost there.

675
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:53,403
Put your back into it!
- I got piles!

676
01:24:01,742 --> 01:24:06,404
We need fresh horses. / Do
you recognize this place? / No.

677
01:24:06,534 --> 01:24:10,283
The last place on earth
we were all alive together.

678
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,784
Until we meet again, my friends!

679
01:24:13,785 --> 01:24:16,408
That will not last long.

680
01:25:00,623 --> 01:25:04,326
Get me out of here!

681
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:08,412
Look! The rope. Quickly!

682
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,197
The horse!

683
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:23,541
For God's sake, where are you?

684
01:25:23,542 --> 01:25:26,948
Through the gate!

685
01:25:28,876 --> 01:25:31,250
These horses are done.

686
01:25:40,294 --> 01:25:42,491
It's about time!

687
01:25:47,128 --> 01:25:52,170
Come on! / Show off! / Why
you always lagging behind?

688
01:25:52,171 --> 01:25:56,170
Did you hear that voice?
- That unfortunate accent!

689
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:59,873
All for one and one for all.

690
01:26:06,005 --> 01:26:09,255
My wife's in there.
She dances with all the best people.

691
01:26:09,256 --> 01:26:13,088
And sometimes she
waves at me. Sometimes.

692
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:09,595
Madame, why are you not
wearing the diamond studs?

693
01:27:09,596 --> 01:27:12,670
You knew that I wishes to see them.

694
01:27:12,721 --> 01:27:18,679
Your Majesty, in this big
crowds I fear I might lose them.

695
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,721
You were wrong.
I made you this present...

696
01:27:21,722 --> 01:27:24,215
...to adore yourself.

697
01:27:25,097 --> 01:27:27,180
I am highly displeased.

698
01:27:27,181 --> 01:27:32,181
If Your Majesty pleases,

699
01:27:32,182 --> 01:27:34,674
I can send to the palace for them.

700
01:27:35,224 --> 01:27:38,891
Do so. And immediately.

701
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:53,766
Keep going, Reggie. It's filling up.

702
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:56,639
I'm doing my best.
- Not good enough.

703
01:28:09,936 --> 01:28:14,467
Her Majesty was radiantly pale.

704
01:28:14,728 --> 01:28:19,644
May I respectfully direct Your Majesty's
attention to these sweets in this box?

705
01:28:19,645 --> 01:28:24,093
I feel sure you would agree,
they are at royal confection.

706
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:32,562
What does this mean? / If the
Queen has her studs, which I doubt,

707
01:28:32,563 --> 01:28:36,104
Count them, Sire.
If there are only ten,

708
01:28:36,105 --> 01:28:40,720
asked Her Majesty
where the other two.

709
01:28:50,607 --> 01:28:54,815
No one may enter without an invitation.

710
01:28:54,816 --> 01:28:57,641
It's the Cardinal's order.

711
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:00,855
I beg your pardon, sir?

712
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,307
I said...

713
01:29:06,109 --> 01:29:08,388
Doesn't matter.

714
01:29:23,861 --> 01:29:27,231
Come on. That's it.

715
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:30,766
Come on! That's good.

716
01:29:30,861 --> 01:29:33,603
Again!

717
01:29:43,446 --> 01:29:46,654
Madame, he may still come.

718
01:29:46,655 --> 01:29:50,108
I feel sure he will.

719
01:29:50,197 --> 01:29:55,071
How can he, Constance.
It's no use.

720
01:29:55,072 --> 01:29:58,561
It's over. It's...

721
01:30:34,535 --> 01:30:37,526
That has to be Constance.

722
01:30:40,577 --> 01:30:45,867
Light the fireworks,
when you hear the fanfare.

723
01:31:47,751 --> 01:31:51,038
- D'Artagnan!
- What?

724
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:05,544
I'm almost there, Constance.

725
01:32:05,545 --> 01:32:10,207
Come down there!

726
01:32:13,504 --> 01:32:15,666
Sorry.

727
01:32:50,258 --> 01:32:53,296
Why are we stopping, gentlemen?

728
01:33:25,804 --> 01:33:30,419
Hurry! / I am hurrying!

729
01:33:32,555 --> 01:33:34,882
Stand fast, boy!

730
01:34:46,646 --> 01:34:48,760
Blast!

731
01:34:52,939 --> 01:34:55,266
Come on!

732
01:35:47,945 --> 01:35:52,062
Guards! After him!
Follow that bear!

733
01:35:56,946 --> 01:36:00,979
There you are, my old friends!

734
01:36:03,405 --> 01:36:06,111
Here are your men to the rescue!

735
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:31,945
Thank God, you're all alive!

736
01:36:34,283 --> 01:36:37,025
Can you get me up there, please?

737
01:37:04,412 --> 01:37:08,114
Wait a minute...

738
01:37:08,745 --> 01:37:12,151
He tore up our carpet.

739
01:38:03,335 --> 01:38:07,203
Quickly, gentlemen! To your places!

740
01:38:41,714 --> 01:38:46,459
Three, four, five... silly me!

741
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:53,003
One, two, three, four...

742
01:38:57,132 --> 01:39:01,131
One, two, three, four...
Stand still!

743
01:39:05,258 --> 01:39:09,173
Get off! Come!

744
01:39:14,593 --> 01:39:16,836
Excuse me, please?

745
01:39:25,719 --> 01:39:30,635
Thank you, for adhering my wishes.
But I believe you've lost two studs.

746
01:39:30,636 --> 01:39:33,544
I'll bring them to you.

747
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:41,881
Sire, you bring me two more.
How kind of you. Now I have fourteen.

748
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:43,928
14?

749
01:39:43,929 --> 01:39:47,637
13, 14.. What does this mean, Cardinal?

750
01:39:47,638 --> 01:39:50,925
It means, sire, that...

751
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:57,596
...I wished to present those studs to
Her Majesty, but not dare to offer them.

752
01:39:57,597 --> 01:40:00,013
I gave them to her through you.

753
01:40:00,014 --> 01:40:02,805
I'm terribly grateful to your Eminence.

754
01:40:02,806 --> 01:40:06,931
For I'm certain that these two studs
cost you much more than the other twelve,

755
01:40:06,932 --> 01:40:09,674
cost by His Majesty.

756
01:40:17,516 --> 01:40:21,307
Eminence, D'Artagnan gain
entry to the hotel. / Quite so.

757
01:40:21,308 --> 01:40:26,683
You failed me.
I've lost points.

758
01:40:26,684 --> 01:40:30,017
The game continues.
- You would not seek this boy?

759
01:40:30,018 --> 01:40:34,350
To what end? Vengeance?
That is an expensive luxury.

760
01:40:34,351 --> 01:40:39,059
Statesmen can not afford it.
No, I could use such a man.

761
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:42,268
Perhaps I shall seek him out after all.

762
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:46,352
Your Eminence is a great player,
great enough to lose.

763
01:40:46,353 --> 01:40:48,852
I do not like to lose.

764
01:40:48,853 --> 01:40:51,311
You must suit yourself, my lady.

765
01:40:51,312 --> 01:40:56,969
But if in the end you should,
do it with becoming grace.

766
01:41:03,271 --> 01:41:06,974
My darling, darling.

767
01:41:07,272 --> 01:41:11,438
Never again will I let you
go in such terrible danger.

768
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:15,022
Time gallop, sometimes fighting,
stab times. What the hell!

769
01:41:15,023 --> 01:41:17,772
It's the day's work.

770
01:41:17,773 --> 01:41:21,272
But to find my beautiful
Constance in the end...

771
01:41:21,273 --> 01:41:24,063
Did you miss me?

772
01:41:25,982 --> 01:41:29,435
A foolish question.

773
01:42:42,074 --> 01:42:44,406
I work for him.

774
01:42:44,407 --> 01:42:46,115
Yes.

775
01:42:46,116 --> 01:42:50,150
Young Gascon, now you're a musketeer.

776
01:43:04,201 --> 01:43:07,659
Carry the King's musket with honor.
Now that you are the...

777
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:10,947
four musketeers.

778
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:34,535
Now we're four.

779
01:43:35,371 --> 01:43:39,784
My boss. He waves to you.

780
01:43:39,914 --> 01:43:43,533
Here, take it!

781
01:43:43,747 --> 01:43:45,944
The King!

782
01:43:46,305 --> 01:44:46,175
