Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

21
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,989
No.

22
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:11,227
Come on, come on.

23
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:26,274
Hey.

24
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:32,113
Holy fuck! Holy fuck!

25
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:36,651
Come on.

26
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,272
What the fuck is going on?

27
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:01,707
- <i> Amanda, are you okay?</i>
- What happened?

28
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,308
<i>We crashed. We're in the water!</i>

29
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,592
Just gonna take a blind fuck
out of here right now!

30
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:08,413
<i>It's so fucking dark,</i>
<i>I can't see anything!</i>

31
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:09,547
- Look.
- <i> Come on.</i>

32
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:10,782
Someone help us please.

33
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,387
- Check for Matt.
- He-e-elp!

34
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,389
Help! Please!

35
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,159
He-e-elp! He-e-elp!

36
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:40,377
Jessie.

37
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:43,313
Jessie! Jessie!

38
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:44,314
Shit!

39
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:48,585
Jessie!

40
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:51,689
Come on, wake up.
Wake up, Jessie. Wake up.

41
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:52,856
Jessie!

42
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:17,145
Ow! God!

43
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:23,017
Oh, yeah.

44
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,522
Come on.

45
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,450
Fuck! Fuck!

46
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:41,355
Carla's hot.

47
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,270
Jessie, what're you doing here?

48
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,760
It's nice to see you too.

49
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,294
Why weren't you at the airport?

50
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,928
God, you're so serious.

51
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,232
Hey, Mr. Searles.
Hey, it's Matt.

52
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,367
Yeah, I'm at
the house, she's here.

53
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,370
Yeah.

54
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:02,172
Okay.

55
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,208
He wants to talk to you.

56
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:08,977
Hi, daddy.

57
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:14,616
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I-I told you
not to send the plane.

58
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:16,852
I rode with a friend.

59
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,387
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

60
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:22,822
He's not happy.

61
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:24,557
Can you blame him?

62
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,859
I'm not a kid anymore.

63
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:29,161
I went to NYU
to get away from this.

64
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,634
Whoo! I see a couple of babes.

65
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:37,268
<i>Hey-ey!</i>

66
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,171
- <i> Oh, I'm so excited!</i>
- Aah! Whoop!

67
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:42,973
- Hi!
- Whoo!

68
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,407
- Hey!
- It's hot.

69
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,109
Whooee!

70
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,044
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

71
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,979
Oh, look at this. Oh, my God.

72
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:54,415
Oh, my God!

73
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,417
It's, uh, good
to see you, Matt.

74
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:58,620
- It's been a while.
- Brandon.

75
00:09:58,622 --> 00:09:59,787
It's a nice bike.

76
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:01,455
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, it's okay.

77
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,056
Are you kidding me? Just okay?

78
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:05,092
Look at this. MV Augusta F-4.

79
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:07,360
<i>Horizontal in-line four,</i>
<i>Brembo brakes</i>

80
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:08,694
<i>precision racing all around?</i>

81
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:09,896
Yo, baby, you gotta get me this.

82
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:12,164
Yeah, okay.
This is super-boring.

83
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,698
- Alright.
- Let's get wet. Come on.

84
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,901
- You know your bikes, Eddie.
- Hey, aeromechanics, man.

85
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,103
- <i> Come here.</i>
- Wanna go in?

86
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:21,270
- Uh, yeah, I'll be a minute.
- Right.

87
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,172
Okay.

88
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:24,506
<i>Later, Matt.</i>

89
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:30,245
You have gotten old and grumpy.

90
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:35,315
Uh, I'm sorry, okay?

91
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:37,850
I'll call next time.

92
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,754
I'm just glad you're home okay.

93
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:03,442
- <i> Please!</i>
- The door's not opening!

94
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:05,343
You have to try
to open the fucking door!

95
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,811
The water pressure's too much!

96
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:08,145
You're not gonna get
that thing open!

97
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:09,413
- What?
- Todd!

98
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,181
Unless you equalize
the pressure inside and out

99
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:12,415
<i>you're not getting</i>
<i>that damn thing open!</i>

100
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:13,949
How are we
gonna do that, Spock?

101
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:15,885
It has to be
completely flooded, alright?

102
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:17,753
Jesus! It's not
filling up fast enough!

103
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:19,554
We'll run out
of oxygen by then.

104
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:21,723
How long? How long
till that happens? How long?

105
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:24,225
Look, I don't know,
okay? Hold... hold on! Jesus!

106
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,160
Now, besides the leakage
you gotta remember

107
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:27,495
this thing is airtight.

108
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:29,029
We're not in
a regular car, alright?

109
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:31,398
Look, there's supposed to be
an emergency oxygen system.

110
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,899
I can't tell if
it's activated or not.

111
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,335
- Speak fucking English!
- Todd, I don't know!

112
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,771
Matt, Matt! Jessie!

113
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:40,073
<i>I think they're dead.</i>

114
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:18,474
<i>Jesus! Fuck!</i>

115
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:21,276
Matt! Matt!

116
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,112
<i>Matt! Jessie!</i>

117
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:32,486
Uh!

118
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,599
- Here. Mmm.
- Stop it.

119
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,068
Come on. Let me get one more.
One more. -No, man.

120
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,702
- <i> No, please.</i>
- What?

121
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:24,869
- <i> Come on.</i>
- <i> Please.</i>

122
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,104
What's the matter? U-uh?

123
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,873
- Oh!
- You don't like seafood?

124
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,341
- <i> Oh!</i>
- Nope?

125
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,875
- No!
- U-u-uh!

126
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,777
- Uh, no, no, I don't..
- U-u-uh!

127
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,146
That's so gross.

128
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,180
No.

129
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:43,386
You got your driver's test
again next week.

130
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:44,787
You ready?

131
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:46,621
Yeah.

132
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,292
Hope so. You're
gonna be 18 soon.

133
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:53,327
You don't even have
a driver's license.

134
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:57,798
Thank you for reminding me.

135
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,199
I'm just sayin'.

136
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,267
You're gonna be graduating
in a few months, you know.

137
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:04,771
Doesn't even have
a car to drive.

138
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:09,141
Pass and we'll see.

139
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,044
Yeah?

140
00:14:12,678 --> 00:14:14,912
So, so you get a raise?

141
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,615
<i>Hey, Dylan.</i>

142
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:22,018
Hey, what's up, Brandon?

143
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,919
Nothing much, you know,
just gettin' off work.

144
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:27,323
Oh, you work here? -Ooh, yeah,
I work in the kitchen, uh.

145
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,059
That explains the hair
I found in my food.

146
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:31,660
Yeah.

147
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,067
Happy birthday, Jess.

148
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:41,236
Oh. Uh, thank you.

149
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:46,308
Yeah, well, um,
listen, I got to go.

150
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,310
Uh, yeah. I'll, uh,
I'll call you later, man.

151
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:51,046
- Better.
- Bye.

152
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,917
Sorry, kids. I gotta take this.

153
00:14:57,954 --> 00:14:59,654
<i>Your brother's cute.</i>

154
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:02,356
He keeps calling us kids.
Does he have a girlfriend?

155
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,826
Why? Are you interested?

156
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:06,994
No! He's like
a big brother to me.

157
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:09,330
What? What does that make me?

158
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,233
Hey, Carla, what's up?

159
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:19,738
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:25,376
What's up, guys?

161
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:28,379
How's it goin'? Hmm?

162
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:30,981
What are you eating? Shrimp?

163
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,148
I love shrimp.

164
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,284
No, no, no. I'm just at, uh..

165
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:42,892
Uh, yeah.

166
00:15:42,894 --> 00:15:46,663
Yeah. I'm just at,
uh, the Social gettin' a bite.

167
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,590
Gonna hand me
that wrench, or what?

168
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:16,593
Don't know why I'm helping you

169
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:19,095
when you won't even
let me take a look.

170
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:21,364
You gotta earn it. Come on.

171
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:28,804
This is a pressure gauge.

172
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:31,673
Whatever. Let me take a look.

173
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:34,276
Hey, hey, hey, hey. No.

174
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:36,511
If you wanna see it,
check the photo.

175
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,945
You really think
it's gonna look like this?

176
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,529
That's the plan.

177
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:55,830
I hope.

178
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,735
Thanks, Matt.

179
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:03,739
I mean it. Really.

180
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,907
You doing this for me, it..

181
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,642
Means a lot.

182
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:18,253
- Who's that?
- Uh, no one.

183
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:21,056
I, I gotta go,
so see you later tonight?

184
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,757
Yeah. Okay.

185
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,031
<i>Hey, D. How're we doin'?</i>

186
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,302
Damn.

187
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,404
That ride is sweet, baby.

188
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,840
Brother's gonna flip
when he sees it.

189
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:41,374
You 'bout to spoil that kid.

190
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:43,709
The seats you ordered
fit like a glove.

191
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,278
Thanks for the hookup, man.

192
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,547
Speaking of the hookup,
give me the details, homey.

193
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:50,949
Carla.

194
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:53,352
- Why are you even here?
- 'Cause I like tinkering.

195
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:56,722
Come on now. Carla.

196
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,991
I gotta pick up Searles
in an hour. Is the car ready?

197
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:02,361
- You gonna do me like that?
- Yeah.

198
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:04,197
I'm a happily married man.
You know what that means?

199
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,098
I live vicariously through you.

200
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,732
<i>Come on now. Details.</i>

201
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:10,001
So, when I left you
the other night

202
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:11,635
she was all over you.

203
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,806
- I took her home early.
- Why?

204
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,574
Because I don't know
if it's such a good idea

205
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:20,243
dating someone that
works for Hank Searles.

206
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,246
- Why you trippin'?
- Is the car ready?

207
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,381
Yes. I had the guys
give it a once-over.

208
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,184
Which is what you should have
been doing with old Carla.

209
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:31,187
Yeah. Now.

210
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:33,656
Check it out.

211
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:37,726
- It's a limo.
- No, it's a limo on roids.

212
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:39,628
We spared no expense
on this bad boy.

213
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,430
Bulletproof glass.
I'm talkin' Kevlar.

214
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:46,134
Power-secured locks.
Blast-resistant underbelly.

215
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:48,002
This shit right here
is built like a tank

216
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:49,970
and it drives like a sports car.

217
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:52,473
Only thing it doesn't do
is shift into hyper speed.

218
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:54,508
Try it out, Skywalker.

219
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,877
Take Hector for a ride.

220
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:31,480
What do you think
of the new ride?

221
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:33,716
I'm thinkin' about movin' in.

222
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:37,019
<i>Reports are coming in that.</i>

223
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:39,022
<i>Searles Industries is expected</i>
<i>to lay off at least</i>

224
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:41,357
a 1000 more employees
by the end of this week.

225
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,792
This marks the third
consecutive round of layoffs

226
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:45,795
from newly appointed CEO
Hank Searles

227
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:47,930
<i>who took the position</i>
<i>over from his father</i>

228
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:49,865
and losing the India bid
to which could have been

229
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,768
a billion dollars worth
of airplane contracts.

230
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:57,072
<i>Mr. Searles, Mr. Searles,</i>
<i>please, give us a comment.</i>

231
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:59,040
Just one comment, please.

232
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:01,509
Okay, look, my grandfather
came here with nothing

233
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:03,144
and he built this company
from scratch.

234
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:05,779
And we've been very fortunate,
but in today's climate

235
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:08,281
when most of my competitors
are sending jobs overseas

236
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:11,885
I'm doing everything I can
to keep them here in this town.

237
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:14,087
Unfortunately, that means
having to make some cuts.

238
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,355
- But what about all the families?
- I'm sorry.

239
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:16,989
All the families
that are losing everything?

240
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:19,391
Mr. Searles, please,
one more comment!

241
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:31,114
I feel like working off
some aggression.

242
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:52,056
Looks like Uncle Sam's been
keeping you on your toes.

243
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:53,323
You did pretty good too.

244
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:55,358
Not bad for a lefty.

245
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,522
I owe all the credit
to your old man for that.

246
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,731
- He did like to shoot.
- You don't?

247
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:04,768
Nah, I did a tour.
Saw enough of it.

248
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,636
Listen, Matt.

249
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:09,239
You've been driving for me
since you were a kid.

250
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:10,440
I'm sure you know that
my daughter's

251
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:12,508
the most important person
in my world.

252
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:16,679
What you don't know is

253
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:19,882
how many threats I've had
to deal with on her life.

254
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:22,285
Threats that
she doesn't know about.

255
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:24,353
And I wanna keep it that way.

256
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,525
I want you to start
carrying this.

257
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,875
- <i> Pull!</i>
- <i> Oh, fuck!</i>

258
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:21,012
<i>Come on!</i>

259
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:23,647
<i>The intercom's fucked!</i>

260
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:26,016
<i>Come on!</i>

261
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:29,152
<i>Fuck, why isn't it</i>
<i>fucking working?</i>

262
00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:31,921
- Stop it! Please! Please!
- <i> Fuck! Son of a bitch!</i>

263
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:33,523
<i>No!</i>

264
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:36,225
- Hey, it's gonna be alright..
- I can't..

265
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:37,893
<i>Brandon, stop hitting</i>
<i>the window!</i>

266
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:41,364
<i>You're not going</i>
<i>to get it open!</i>

267
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:44,467
<i>What are we going to do?</i>
<i>What are we going to do?</i>

268
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:49,105
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

269
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:51,641
Oh, my God, what are we gonna
do? We're trapped in here!

270
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:54,477
- Get her to shut the fuck up!
- <i> Hey, don't yell at her, alright?</i>

271
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:56,679
Guys! Guys, calm down!

272
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:58,682
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What is that?
What is that, Matt?</i>

273
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:00,283
- <i> Shut the fuck up!</i>
- <i> Matt! Matt!</i>

274
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:02,084
- Relax!
- <i> Please!</i>

275
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:04,654
- <i> Shut the fuck up!</i>
- <i> Matt, can you hear us?</i>

276
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:06,760
Yeah, I can hear you.
The intercom's working.

277
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:07,882
<i>Everyone, shut up!</i>

278
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,193
<i>We, we need you</i>
<i>to roll down the barrier.</i>

279
00:23:10,195 --> 00:23:12,061
<i>Matt, is that a phone?</i>

280
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:17,032
<i>It's a fucking phone!</i>
<i>Is that a phone?</i>

281
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:20,035
- Come on. Come on.
- <i> Why isn't he picking it up?</i>

282
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:23,672
<i>Answer, Matt! Why don't you
answer the goddamn phone?</i>

283
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:25,974
<i>Fucking answer it right now!</i>
Come on.

284
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:28,043
<i>Why aren't you doing anything?</i>

285
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,679
Matt, answer the damn phone!

286
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,114
Matt!

287
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:35,215
<i>Matt!</i>

288
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:41,455
What's up?

289
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:43,523
How was your driver's
test today?

290
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,692
I forgot.

291
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,031
What are you doing in there?

292
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,932
Playing video games.

293
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:58,837
What happened?

294
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,305
Come on, man. Don't ignore me.

295
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:02,040
What happened?

296
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:04,076
- I got into a fight.
- Yeah, no shit. With who?

297
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:05,777
Who cares? It's not
a big deal, okay?

298
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,812
I care, okay? This
is the third time in a month.

299
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:11,116
- I can take care of myself.
- Obviously not.

300
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,218
It's not your problem, Matt.

301
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,454
You're my brother.
It's my problem.

302
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:17,722
Okay, well, you used to get
in fights all the time.

303
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,724
Yeah. I'm not proud of that.

304
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,727
There's a way to get along
with people, Dylan.

305
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,495
You don't have to do that.
Stop!

306
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:26,231
Stop pretending
you're dad or something.

307
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,167
Get a goddamn life!

308
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:30,536
I have a life.

309
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:33,439
It's called taking care of you.
Really?

310
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,307
Well, I hardly ever see you

311
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,043
because you're always out with some
mystery girl that I've never met!

312
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,945
I barely get to see her
because I'm busy out there

313
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:43,014
busting my ass to put food
on the table for you!

314
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:57,797
I don't mean
to sound ungrateful.

315
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:02,501
I just don't want you
to waste your life on me.

316
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,606
I'm not wasting
anything on you.

317
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,043
We're a family.

318
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,512
<i>We stick together, okay?</i>
<i>That's what we do.</i>

319
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,681
I got your back, okay?

320
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,854
Maybe I, uh..

321
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:28,257
Maybe I need
to teach you some moves.

322
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:29,925
- Seriously.
- Really?

323
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,893
Just some Ranger type stuff.

324
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:34,029
You can learn how to be
a tough guy for once.

325
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:36,264
Oh-ho! Look at that.

326
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:40,801
Go under..

327
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:42,235
Okay. Alright. Alright.

328
00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:44,136
You got me. Enough!

329
00:25:44,138 --> 00:25:45,605
Oh, okay! Enough! Stop!

330
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:47,640
You suck!

331
00:25:47,642 --> 00:25:50,109
Jesus Christ!

332
00:25:50,111 --> 00:25:52,345
What am I feeding you?

333
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:56,182
I've got reserves
this weekend, okay?

334
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:57,517
So just..

335
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,588
Don't do something stupid. Okay?

336
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:09,061
I hate you. Get in there.

337
00:26:09,063 --> 00:26:10,328
<i>Go.</i>

338
00:26:19,738 --> 00:26:22,107
Come on.
You'll have a good time.

339
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:23,341
And he's a good guy. Trust me.

340
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:25,710
- And he likes you.
- Of course he likes me.

341
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:28,480
He's getting
the better end of the deal.

342
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:30,081
Fuck you, man!

343
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,752
Oh, shit. Wait here. Hey!

344
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:40,491
Hey! Hey, hey!
Get off! Come on!

345
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,493
Get the fuck out of here. Now!

346
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:44,896
Tell Todd we want
our shit back.

347
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:47,298
Yeah, tell him yourself.

348
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,468
What? What's going on?
You alright?

349
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,870
I'm fine. Get the fuck off me.

350
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:01,443
You worry about her.
Don't worry about me.

351
00:27:02,546 --> 00:27:03,913
<i>Relax, man.</i>

352
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:05,314
Dylan, wait.

353
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:07,282
What do you want?

354
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:08,917
Look, I know what you're doing.

355
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,985
- You don't know anything.
- Drugs?

356
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:14,021
Selling them at parties?
I mean, what if you get caught?

357
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:16,491
- What do you care?
- Well, I care about you.

358
00:27:18,794 --> 00:27:21,630
You know, I, uh..

359
00:27:21,632 --> 00:27:23,865
I thought you and me..

360
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:29,370
Never mind.

361
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:30,770
Please.

362
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:36,009
I don't want to see
you get hurt.

363
00:27:38,713 --> 00:27:40,447
Too late.

364
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:52,227
<i>Matt! Matt, what the fuck</i>
<i>are you doing up there?</i>

365
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:55,263
<i>Matt, we need you</i>
<i>to open up the barrier.</i>

366
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:57,032
<i>Yo. There's gotta be a way</i>
<i>to roll this thing down!</i>

367
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:59,367
- <i> Matt, can you still hear us?</i>
- <i> Matt, please, answer us!</i>

368
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:00,835
Just give me a second!
Let me think!

369
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:02,436
<i>The barrier</i>
<i>can come down manually.</i>

370
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:04,672
<i>Eddie says there's</i>
<i>a manual way to open it.</i>

371
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:06,707
<i>Yeah, Eddie says</i>
<i>there's a manual lever.</i>

372
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:09,877
- <i> What's going on in there?</i>
- <i> I... in the glove box!</i>

373
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:12,445
<i>Stop this fucking sitting</i>
<i>there and do something!</i>

374
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:16,816
<i>Matt, what's going on, man?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

375
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:19,518
<i>Yo! Can you hear us?</i>

376
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,388
- <i> Come on.</i>
- <i> Matt! What are you doing?</i>

377
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,590
<i>The lever! Just fuckin'</i>
<i>roll it down now!</i>

378
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:26,859
<i>Matt, we need you, man.</i>

379
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:28,360
<i>We need you.</i>

380
00:28:28,362 --> 00:28:30,762
<i>Come on. Come on, Matt.</i>

381
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:36,535
<i>Matt! Put it down.</i>

382
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:38,471
<i>Hey! Matt.</i>

383
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:41,373
Go! Brandon! Brandon, look!
Go, go, go!

384
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:43,074
- Jessie. Jessie.
- <i> Brandon, get in the back.</i>

385
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:44,843
Jessie. Jessie, baby?
Baby, what happened?

386
00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:46,311
Brandon, stop shaking her.
Get in the back!

387
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:48,146
- What's wrong with her?
- She's been drugged!

388
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:49,348
What happened back there, man?

389
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:50,649
Who were those guys
on the bridge?

390
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:52,450
I don't know.

391
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:54,418
- You okay?
- No, my leg's stuck, okay.

392
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,487
- I can't move it.
- Shit!

393
00:28:58,356 --> 00:29:01,057
What the fuck, man? The doors
and windows aren't opening, man!

394
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:03,226
We're fucking flooding back here.
They're electronic, okay?

395
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:05,828
They must have short circuited.
We still have power though!

396
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,596
We have battery. That's why
the lights are still on.

397
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:09,699
How long you think
we'll last down here?

398
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:12,068
- 30 minutes maybe.
- Fuck.

399
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,302
We need to get out of here!

400
00:29:13,304 --> 00:29:15,538
We need to get out of here!
And right now!

401
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:24,046
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

402
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:27,849
I have 911.. I'm in here.

403
00:29:29,318 --> 00:29:31,552
Hello. Hello!

404
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:34,155
I'm here.

405
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:36,056
Hello!

406
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:38,992
Hello?

407
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:41,294
Hi! Hi! We have a driver!

408
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:44,397
We have the driver.

409
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,801
Where are we? W - we're at
the East Canal Waterway.

410
00:29:47,803 --> 00:29:49,903
<i>Uh, we crashed off</i>
<i>the Arthur Road Bridge.</i>

411
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:52,206
We're... we're off
the East Canal Waterway

412
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,907
and off of Arthur Road Bridge.

413
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:56,410
Did she hear all that?

414
00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:57,677
Hello?

415
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:00,512
<i>Hello!</i>

416
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:02,881
<i>Hello!</i>

417
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,950
Can you hear me?

418
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:07,751
Hello?

419
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:12,489
- <i> Fuck!</i>
- Fuck!

420
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,925
No, no, no! No!

421
00:30:17,995 --> 00:30:20,229
- Oh, no!
- <i> Yeah, maybe she heard you.</i>

422
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:21,231
- <i> Please!</i>
- No, hold on.

423
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:23,266
- No, fuck!
- Oh!

424
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:26,535
I lost it.

425
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:30,071
<i>I lost it. I lost it.</i>

426
00:30:30,073 --> 00:30:32,273
<i>- <i>Oh, no!</i>
- <i> Jesus, come here.</i>

427
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:34,109
<i>Oh, no.</i>

428
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:36,151
We have a GPS tracker.
They'll find us.

429
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:30,191
- <i> Oh, Dylan!</i>
- What's wrong?

430
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:32,761
Matt, he's not breathing!

431
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:34,763
Dylan! Dylan!

432
00:32:34,765 --> 00:32:36,164
Dylan!

433
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:38,400
Dylan!

434
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:39,868
<i>No.</i>

435
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,369
No. No!

436
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:43,938
No! No!

437
00:32:47,677 --> 00:32:49,043
Oh.

438
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:51,179
No.

439
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:56,416
No!

440
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,786
<i>No!</i>

441
00:33:01,721 --> 00:33:03,254
<i>No!</i>

442
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:55,242
He seems to be doing okay.

443
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,878
No, he's not.

444
00:34:09,124 --> 00:34:10,791
Hey.

445
00:34:10,793 --> 00:34:12,859
I'm here for you, babe.

446
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:21,702
Matt?

447
00:34:31,513 --> 00:34:33,580
I'm so sorry.

448
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:38,150
<i>I loved Dylan so much.</i>

449
00:35:15,956 --> 00:35:17,489
I, I..

450
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,557
Before my mom died..

451
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,595
I told her
that I would protect him..

452
00:35:24,597 --> 00:35:26,096
<i>Keep him safe.</i>

453
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:28,165
I failed her.

454
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,233
No, that's not true.

455
00:35:31,602 --> 00:35:33,503
He didn't say anything,
but I knew.

456
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:35,570
I knew he'd been in a fight.

457
00:35:36,905 --> 00:35:38,139
<i>Just..</i>

458
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:43,010
I can't understand
why he'd take his own life.

459
00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:50,517
You can... grow up with someone

460
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,452
live with them..

461
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:54,887
Never really know 'em.

462
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:57,190
<i>Even if they're</i>
<i>your own brother.</i>

463
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:59,358
You don't understand.

464
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:06,498
My dad was a factory man.

465
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,567
Everybody loved him.

466
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:12,170
But that didn't pay his bills
when he got sick.

467
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,573
Family had to try to do it.

468
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:16,408
We went bankrupt, he died anyway

469
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,510
and then... a year later

470
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,346
my mom passed.

471
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:24,983
So there I was, 19 years old

472
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:26,151
with 3 younger brothers.

473
00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:28,352
Not 1, 3.

474
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,354
I slowly figured out

475
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,824
how to make my way
out of nowhere and..

476
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,559
I managed to pay
for all three of them

477
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,029
to go through college.

478
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,830
All except for one.

479
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,398
He's the knucklehead.
He's the, he's the fuck up.

480
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:46,334
He took his tuition money

481
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:48,202
and he went off and tried
to make a hip-hop video.

482
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:50,138
Wanted to be thug life.

483
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,708
Didn't finish the video
and he sounds like Kanye light.

484
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,509
So here you have brothers

485
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:58,112
who deal
with mostly the same shit..

486
00:36:58,114 --> 00:37:00,947
And yet we made
radically different decisions.

487
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:05,784
Matt, it's not what we face..

488
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:07,886
That defines us.

489
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:10,022
It's how we react to it.

490
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,508
You think he's gonna be okay?

491
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,876
He's tough.

492
00:37:33,112 --> 00:37:35,446
I wouldn't trust Jessie
with anyone else.

493
00:37:38,184 --> 00:37:40,285
I should have gone to the wake.

494
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:06,878
<i>Matt, dude, what the fuck</i>
<i>are you doing in there? Shit!</i>

495
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,213
- <i> Oh.</i>
- <i> Just get it up there.</i>

496
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:10,515
<i>Hey, just-just</i>
<i>stop for a second! Hold on!</i>

497
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:11,782
No, no, no.

498
00:38:11,784 --> 00:38:12,883
Wait, wait, wait.
Well, hold on.

499
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:15,286
Hold on. Hold on for a second!

500
00:38:15,288 --> 00:38:16,987
What time is it?

501
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:19,889
- Who the fuck cares what time it is?
- <i> Midnight, midnight!</i>

502
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:22,225
Holy shit! -Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. Alright!

503
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:24,126
Matt just said that we're
in the East Canal waterway.

504
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:25,835
That means we're being
dragged by the undertow.

505
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:26,796
That's what just happened!

506
00:38:26,798 --> 00:38:28,798
It's only a matter of time
before we're dragged out to sea.

507
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,900
Wwwait. H-how much longer?

508
00:38:30,902 --> 00:38:32,702
What are you talking about?

509
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,236
Look, tide's
at 5 a.m., alright?

510
00:38:34,238 --> 00:38:35,370
And then the undertow,
that means

511
00:38:35,372 --> 00:38:37,105
the waterway's
about three miles.

512
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,775
We have roughly, maybe, an hour
until we get dragged out to sea.

513
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,710
If that happens,
we're not gonna get out of here.

514
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:44,246
Oh, man! Brandon, man,
we're fucked, man.

515
00:38:44,248 --> 00:38:45,380
- We're not.
- No, we're not!

516
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:47,142
- <i> We're fucked!</i>
- Hold on!

517
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,316
<i>You shut up! Calm down!</i>

518
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:50,885
- <i> Shut up!</i>
- <i> Calm down!</i>

519
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:52,567
- <i> No, man!</i>
- <i> Listen.</i>

520
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:58,724
- I'm not dying down here, man!
- Calm down.

521
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:01,860
We're gonna survive.
We are going to be okay!

522
00:39:03,296 --> 00:39:04,696
Listen.

523
00:39:04,698 --> 00:39:08,067
Matt said
that the GPS was working.

524
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:10,235
They're gonna find us.

525
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:15,899
What the fuck
are you looking at, Amanda?

526
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:18,034
Lo-looking at me
like you got something to say.

527
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:21,071
Go ahead and say it.
Don't start, Todd.

528
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:22,505
Don't you think
it's a pretty big coincidence

529
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:25,040
that those kidnappers were just
waiting for us out there?

530
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,643
It's not exactly
a very populated part of town.

531
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:30,278
Yeah, that is true.
Yeah, they were waiting for us.

532
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,148
They knew
we were gonna be there.

533
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,049
Party was your idea, Brandon.

534
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:36,383
And what are you trying to say?

535
00:40:36,385 --> 00:40:37,885
Now, who else knew
that you'd be there?

536
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:40,954
You did, moron. -Dude,
you invited us, alright?

537
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:42,088
You are the hookup.
That's right.

538
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,622
I was invited
just like you were.

539
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:45,391
No, you said it was your party.

540
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:47,659
Oh, my God. See, you're a liar.
You can't be trusted.

541
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:49,260
So I'm the liar?
You really wanna go there?

542
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:50,795
You probably couldn't even
get us into the club.

543
00:40:50,797 --> 00:40:52,029
Alright, enough. Enough.

544
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:53,964
We're just tired and paranoid.

545
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,498
There were a lot of people
at that party.

546
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,601
It doesn't mean
that one of us is responsible.

547
00:40:57,603 --> 00:41:00,804
Yeah, but the night was fine
until you showed up.

548
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:02,773
Strange, right?

549
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:04,708
Hey, w-what are you
trying to say?

550
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,310
You know
what I'm trying to say.

551
00:41:07,312 --> 00:41:09,079
You knew they were back there
waiting for us.

552
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:11,014
Oh, really? And how
would I know that, Amanda?

553
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:12,749
Uh, because you sat there
like a coward.

554
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:14,752
You didn't do anything!
They had guns, Amanda!

555
00:41:14,754 --> 00:41:16,520
What was I supposed to do?
I'm not a pussy!

556
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:18,121
But I'm not
tougher than a bullet.

557
00:41:18,123 --> 00:41:20,090
You wanna blame anyone,
blame "Driving Miss Daisy."

558
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:21,391
Oh, really? You wanna bring
Matt into this?

559
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:23,326
Did you even see
what he was doing out there?

560
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:24,627
<i>Exactly right, Brandon.</i>

561
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:26,630
I didn't see anything.
I heard gunshots.

562
00:41:26,632 --> 00:41:28,064
Don't use
your fucking imagination!

563
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:29,432
He was trying to save us!

564
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:32,235
- Yeah. Good job, too.
- We are alive because of him.

565
00:41:32,237 --> 00:41:35,638
There are a lot of people who have
a grudge against Hank Searles!

566
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,573
I mean, he laid off
half this town!

567
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:41,110
He's the reason
it's so fucked up here!

568
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:43,278
Guys, just chill, alright?

569
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,180
Look, I don't have
a grudge against him, okay?

570
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:48,416
My parents didn't work for him.
Hm.

571
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:50,919
Yours did, Amanda.

572
00:41:50,921 --> 00:41:52,654
- I'm warning you.
- Oh, you called me a liar?

573
00:41:52,656 --> 00:41:54,922
Who's the liar now?
Tell him where you work.

574
00:41:54,924 --> 00:41:56,729
No, you know what? Just
leave her alone, Todd.

575
00:41:56,755 --> 00:41:57,458
It doesn't matter.

576
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,393
No, go ahead. Tell him.
Or are you too embarrassed?

577
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:01,161
Seriously, shut up! Alright?

578
00:42:01,163 --> 00:42:02,763
We have bigger problems
right now!

579
00:42:02,765 --> 00:42:04,898
You know what? I don't give
a shit what you or anyone else

580
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,432
thinks about where I work.

581
00:42:06,434 --> 00:42:08,835
You wanna know where I work?
I work at Mermaid Tails.

582
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:12,438
Another strip club? -Oh, let me
tell you, Eddie, her shit's tight.

583
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,475
- But, Amanda, why?
- Do not judge me, Eddie.

584
00:42:15,477 --> 00:42:17,643
Not everyone's born with a
silver spoon stuck in their ass.

585
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:19,478
Yeah, she was born
to ho, Eddie.

586
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,814
Hey. Alright, listen.
Amanda, that just...

587
00:42:21,816 --> 00:42:24,049
You know I had to drop out
of college to help my mom

588
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:26,685
'cause "Little Miss Sunshine's"
father up there laid her off.

589
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,421
I had a little sister to think about.
What was I supposed to do?

590
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:31,256
<i>Dude, just think.</i>

591
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:33,058
You could have just gone to the club down..
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

592
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,060
Hold on, Todd! Alright!
Just hold on for a damn second.

593
00:42:37,629 --> 00:42:39,497
Listen, Amanda, baby,
I don't care

594
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:41,966
about where you work.

595
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:43,467
<i>I don't... don't care.</i>
<i>None of that matters.</i>

596
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:45,703
Yeah, exactly. But instead,
you want to point fingers at me.

597
00:42:45,705 --> 00:42:47,313
How about you point one at
yourself in the matter.

598
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:48,038
Maybe you're involved.

599
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,840
Do I look like
a master kidnapper to you?

600
00:42:49,842 --> 00:42:52,175
I don't know, Amanda. Maybe you
met one of them in the club.

601
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:54,097
Maybe you're fucking
one of them.

602
00:42:56,548 --> 00:42:58,881
- <i> Hey, hey, hey, stop.</i>
- Alright!

603
00:42:58,883 --> 00:43:01,116
Enough! We need
to conserve our energy.

604
00:43:01,118 --> 00:43:03,419
Nobody's responsible for this.

605
00:43:06,223 --> 00:43:08,691
You know, like, you all think
you're better than me.

606
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:10,359
That's the problem.
Nobody thinks that, man.

607
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:12,627
Yeah, sure, you do.
Even you, Brandon.

608
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:15,330
That is why you're nailing
Jessie Searles, right?

609
00:43:15,332 --> 00:43:17,865
Yeah, you'd be set for life.

610
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:19,968
You even stole her away
from your boy Dylan too, man.

611
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,035
That's pretty fucked up.

612
00:43:21,037 --> 00:43:23,604
Do not.. Do not go there, man.

613
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,675
See. You think
you're on the inside now.

614
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:29,276
But what you don't know is that

615
00:43:29,278 --> 00:43:31,378
<i>you're nothing</i>
<i>but a pit stop to her, man.</i>

616
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,613
Nothing but a science experiment

617
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:34,381
till she moves on
to some stockbroker.

618
00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:36,015
You are so pathetic.

619
00:43:36,017 --> 00:43:37,249
<i>Brandon, don't even</i>
<i>worry about it.</i>

620
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:39,252
No, he's just trying
to get under your skin.

621
00:43:39,254 --> 00:43:40,720
You're not good enough
for her, bro.

622
00:43:40,722 --> 00:43:43,656
Or else why would she
blow someone like me, huh?

623
00:43:43,658 --> 00:43:44,824
What did you just say?

624
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:47,426
Dude, you should be
thanking me, man.

625
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:49,996
I taught that whore
everything she knows.

626
00:43:49,998 --> 00:43:52,932
And don't pretend like
you didn't hear either, man.

627
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,433
No, put it this way.

628
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:56,035
Before she lost the weight

629
00:43:56,037 --> 00:43:58,070
I went hoggin' one time
after school with her.

630
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,505
- Is that right? No, she never touched you.
- Oh, really?

631
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:04,176
Dude, that beautiful little
beauty mark on her vag.

632
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:05,377
<i>It's, like, on the
right side</i> -<i>No, Todd.</i>

633
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:08,147
You better watch
your fuckin' mouth, man.

634
00:44:08,149 --> 00:44:10,516
Dude, you know what I thought?

635
00:44:11,217 --> 00:44:13,184
Every time you kiss her

636
00:44:13,186 --> 00:44:15,253
you're tasting my dick.

637
00:44:17,456 --> 00:44:19,691
Stop it! Stop!

638
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:21,492
I'll fuckin' kill you!

639
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:23,794
<i>No! Wait!</i>

640
00:44:25,297 --> 00:44:27,097
<i>You fuckin'..</i>

641
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,898
<i>Brandon, stop it!</i>

642
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,634
<i>Get the fuck</i>
<i>off of him, Brandon!</i>

643
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,741
Stop!

644
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:44,247
- Hey! Hey, hey! Hold on!
- <i> Stop it!</i>

645
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,553
What the fuck is your problem?

646
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:52,488
Yo, stop!

647
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,025
<i>Stop it!</i>

648
00:45:15,176 --> 00:45:17,110
What was that, air max?
Aeromatics?

649
00:45:17,112 --> 00:45:19,680
Oh, my God,
the limo is so dope, dude.

650
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:21,415
I want one.

651
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:34,728
- Shit. Sorry.
- Yeah.

652
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,796
- Hey.
- Straight gold, right?

653
00:45:36,798 --> 00:45:39,099
Yup. Wait. So back this up
for a second now.

654
00:45:39,101 --> 00:45:41,501
You're already working with stiffs? I
thought first years didn't get to work...

655
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,835
Wait a second. Do they stink?

656
00:45:42,837 --> 00:45:45,738
Well, so the cadavers
we use in class

657
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,172
are supposed to be odorless.

658
00:45:47,174 --> 00:45:48,706
But they bring out
this one guy...

659
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:50,408
- Did he have a big dick?
- Keep it classy, Amanda.

660
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:53,043
- <i> Really?</i>
- What? Did he?

661
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:55,846
I, I don't remember. -How do you
not remember something like that?

662
00:45:55,848 --> 00:45:58,882
Uh, maybe because this poor
soul is dead who gave his body

663
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:01,084
to science only to be ridiculed
by the size of his penis?

664
00:46:01,086 --> 00:46:03,654
Oh, my God. You can say
the word, professor. It's cock.

665
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:06,657
Or maybe you guys can let her
finish her story. -Sorry.

666
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:07,859
- Please continue.
- <i> Gee.</i>

667
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:10,061
Well, um, it's no big deal

668
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:12,663
'cause I'd... I'd cut into
cadavers before.

669
00:46:12,665 --> 00:46:15,667
Um, but this guy reeked so bad

670
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:17,702
that I threw up.

671
00:46:17,704 --> 00:46:20,005
Ew! Everywhere. I
threw up everywhere.

672
00:46:20,007 --> 00:46:22,607
Oh, my God! You're so gross.

673
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:24,976
Puke all over the place
just thinking about it.

674
00:46:24,978 --> 00:46:26,979
I cannot get over this car!

675
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:28,480
Look at this. I want
the schematics on this baby.

676
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:29,848
Okay, okay,
you know what? Enough.

677
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,984
Enough about schematics.
Enough about cadavers.

678
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:33,919
Listen up.

679
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:37,623
This is our night. I got
the hookup to South Club.

680
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,891
- <i> Yeah.</i>
- I got the VIP.

681
00:46:39,893 --> 00:46:42,326
- <i> Mm-hmm.</i>
- The works.

682
00:46:42,328 --> 00:46:45,897
Here's to our beautiful dates.
Cocktails!

683
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:47,098
Yeah.

684
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,310
<i>Right over here.</i>
<i>Right over here.</i>

685
00:47:00,312 --> 00:47:02,212
Hey, you enjoying the view,
you perv?

686
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:04,547
Let's go. I turn around
and you're gone.

687
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:07,717
No, I found Todd. He's gonna
get us into South Club tonight.

688
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:10,586
Todd's your hookup? -Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Todd's here?

689
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:12,154
Well, what? You wanted
to get into South Club.

690
00:47:12,156 --> 00:47:13,522
He's the hookup.
Just deal with it.

691
00:47:13,524 --> 00:47:15,424
I only wanna go
if Todd's not full of shit.

692
00:47:15,426 --> 00:47:17,225
<i>I heard that!</i>

693
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:18,793
What's up, college kids?

694
00:47:20,263 --> 00:47:22,197
What's up, Spock?
You coming too?

695
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:24,232
Yeah. Yo,
this party's sick, right?

696
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:25,366
No, Eddie Munster, it's not.

697
00:47:25,368 --> 00:47:28,169
This party fuckin' sucks.
Yo, but look.

698
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:29,937
<i>My boy's gonna</i>
<i>give me a call in five</i>

699
00:47:29,939 --> 00:47:33,508
so we'll seal the deal then we're
gonna roll out of here, okay?

700
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,309
Got it?

701
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:40,881
We'll all go? He's not going
with us, Brandon.

702
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:45,019
- We need him too.
- I don't care.

703
00:47:46,221 --> 00:47:47,421
You know, we don't have
to hang out with him

704
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:48,622
the whole night.

705
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:50,791
Once we get to the club,
we'll ditch him.

706
00:47:50,793 --> 00:47:52,959
It'll be great. It's fine.

707
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:58,397
Jess!

708
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:23,123
<i>Look who's here.</i>

709
00:48:31,364 --> 00:48:34,133
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

710
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:36,001
<i>I don't owe you fuckin'</i>
<i>anything!</i>

711
00:48:36,003 --> 00:48:37,903
- Hey, what's going on?
- <i> Fuck you!</i>

712
00:48:37,905 --> 00:48:39,304
<i>Yo, Matt! Over here.</i>

713
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:40,738
<i>I don't owe you</i>
<i>any fucking money!</i>

714
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,639
- Hey.
- <i> Whoa!</i>

715
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:45,009
<i>Matt! Kick his ass, man!</i>

716
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:49,012
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

717
00:48:49,014 --> 00:48:50,514
- <i> Holy shit!</i>
- Baby, let's go, come on.

718
00:48:50,516 --> 00:48:52,849
Everybody who came with me,
let's go!

719
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:55,384
Now!

720
00:48:55,386 --> 00:48:57,347
<i>Come on, let's get out of here.</i>

721
00:48:58,155 --> 00:48:59,455
Jessie.

722
00:49:02,493 --> 00:49:04,126
Jessie, I'm sorry.
Please, come on.

723
00:49:04,128 --> 00:49:06,795
Not now, Brandon.

724
00:49:06,797 --> 00:49:08,564
Well, just come
sit in the back, please.

725
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:12,267
Brandon, sit down.
I'm taking everybody home.

726
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:18,807
<i>Oh, shit. I'm so glad</i>
<i>to be out of there.</i>

727
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:22,077
- Baby, go.
- Ahh! God.

728
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:26,148
Ohh.

729
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,250
Yo, look how sick
this ride is, man.

730
00:49:28,252 --> 00:49:30,685
Babe, babe, do something.
Oh, I think it's broken.

731
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:36,091
Champagne.
Let's get some music on.

732
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:38,661
- <i> You okay? Let me see.</i>
- <i> Babe, stop.</i>

733
00:49:42,098 --> 00:49:44,934
What was that?
Is that the intercom?

734
00:49:44,936 --> 00:49:47,536
Hey, yo! Yo, Matt.
Thanks for that, Matt.

735
00:49:47,538 --> 00:49:49,271
You got some killer moves
back there, man.

736
00:49:49,273 --> 00:49:50,406
Jackie Chan and shit.

737
00:49:50,408 --> 00:49:53,208
<i>Hey, shut the fuck up!</i>

738
00:50:14,198 --> 00:50:16,265
How long has it been?

739
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:20,836
You have to stop asking that.

740
00:50:22,939 --> 00:50:24,859
I'll tell you
what we need to do.

741
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:28,710
We need to get
that gun from him.

742
00:50:28,712 --> 00:50:29,911
Why?

743
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:33,581
'Cause I'm not convinced
he's not in on this.

744
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,349
No one gives a fuck
what you think, Todd.

745
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:36,783
No.

746
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:38,452
I think he knows
how to get out of here

747
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:40,153
but he can't because
his dumb ass is stuck.

748
00:50:40,155 --> 00:50:43,322
Trapped in a limo underwater,
nobody's going anywhere.

749
00:50:43,324 --> 00:50:47,626
No, man. He keeps on closing that
window like he's hiding something.

750
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:48,960
I say we sneak attack him.

751
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,097
And what exactly
is your plan, Todd?

752
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:53,898
I say we get the gun

753
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,167
we threaten to shoot Jessie
until he gets on the phone

754
00:50:56,169 --> 00:50:58,102
and calls for help.

755
00:50:58,104 --> 00:51:00,504
That's your big plan?
You wanna kill Jessie?

756
00:51:00,506 --> 00:51:02,473
You're such a big moron,
you know that?

757
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:04,942
When we tried to call 911
earlier, he didn't stop us.

758
00:51:04,944 --> 00:51:07,946
What if he's got a button up there
that jams our frequency or something?

759
00:51:07,948 --> 00:51:11,382
You cannot tell me a high-tech limo
like this has shit communications.

760
00:51:11,384 --> 00:51:13,418
<i>Think about it.</i>

761
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,219
- Maybe he's right.
- Of course I'm right.

762
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:16,687
Come on, Amanda.

763
00:51:16,689 --> 00:51:18,822
You're saying yourself he tried
to save us back there.

764
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:21,759
Well, I don't know. I mean,
why don't we just ask him, okay?

765
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:23,293
'Cause we've been down here
way too long

766
00:51:23,295 --> 00:51:25,094
and I'm getting really scared.

767
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:26,529
No one has come to look for us.

768
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:29,932
That is because nobody knows
we're down here, Amanda.

769
00:51:29,934 --> 00:51:31,467
You really think those guys
back there on the road

770
00:51:31,469 --> 00:51:32,935
<i>are gonna tell anyone?</i>

771
00:51:32,937 --> 00:51:35,003
We are down here by ourselves.

772
00:51:35,005 --> 00:51:36,771
Now we can figure a way
out of this

773
00:51:36,773 --> 00:51:38,406
or we can sit here
and wait to die.

774
00:51:38,408 --> 00:51:41,709
Personally, I'm gonna do
something about it.

775
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:53,921
Matt.

776
00:52:02,598 --> 00:52:04,865
Hey, man, you, uh..

777
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:07,935
You need some help with that
leg or something, man?

778
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:10,070
No. I've already tried.

779
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:11,838
Go sit back down, Todd.

780
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:15,308
Well, there's just not much
to do back here, man.

781
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,510
Todd, I said sit down!

782
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:24,016
- Todd!
- Move now, motherfucker!

783
00:52:24,018 --> 00:52:26,386
- Todd, what are you doing?
- Oh, my God!

784
00:52:26,388 --> 00:52:28,554
I'm getting the fuck... -You're
not gonna help anything!

785
00:52:28,556 --> 00:52:32,424
- <i> Just calm down, right now.</i>
- Todd, Todd, stop it!

786
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:40,230
<i>Stop it! Knock it off!</i>

787
00:52:40,232 --> 00:52:43,099
- What is wrong with you?
- <i> ...stop!</i>

788
00:52:45,003 --> 00:52:46,802
<i>Fuck!</i>

789
00:52:46,804 --> 00:52:48,370
<i>Don't be stupid, Todd.</i>

790
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:49,872
Give me back the gun.

791
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:51,273
Come back here
and take it, Matt.

792
00:52:51,275 --> 00:52:52,807
You're out
of your fucking mind!

793
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:55,577
Jesus! If the water doesn't
kill us, you fucking idiot will!

794
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:57,178
Give him back
the gun now, Todd!

795
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,747
I'm in fucking charge here,
alright?

796
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:01,716
Now open the doors!

797
00:53:03,285 --> 00:53:06,287
You think I'm doing this
on purpose?

798
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:09,057
Matthew, I'm not like
one of these clowns

799
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:10,825
that believes your bullshit.

800
00:53:10,827 --> 00:53:14,262
Open the fucking doors. I know
you're involved in this.

801
00:53:14,264 --> 00:53:15,863
Now do it right now.
Oh, my God.

802
00:53:15,865 --> 00:53:17,431
<i>Todd, don't be an idiot.</i>

803
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:20,134
- <i> Get us out!</i>
- <i> Let us out!</i>

804
00:53:21,403 --> 00:53:22,769
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die!

805
00:53:22,771 --> 00:53:25,439
Help me, please! Please!

806
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:29,943
Shut the fuck up, Amanda.
Nobody can hear you except us.

807
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:33,746
- So, shut up!
- Calm down.

808
00:53:33,748 --> 00:53:35,447
Calm down.

809
00:53:47,493 --> 00:53:49,661
The hatch.

810
00:53:53,298 --> 00:53:55,333
There's a hatch.

811
00:53:58,737 --> 00:54:00,838
What? What did you say?

812
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,643
Behind the rear seat there's
a hatch that leads to the trunk.

813
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:07,846
You can go through that.

814
00:54:16,888 --> 00:54:19,223
Move! Get out of the way!

815
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:30,566
- I'm going.
- Wait, wait, wait.

816
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:32,302
Hold on, Brandon, alright?

817
00:54:32,304 --> 00:54:34,871
The trunk could be flooded.
Well, what if it's not?

818
00:54:34,873 --> 00:54:36,038
Yeah, but you could fill
the entire car.

819
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,373
We have to try!

820
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:40,042
Brandon, alright, Jesus
it's too dangerous, okay?

821
00:54:40,044 --> 00:54:41,443
<i>We can't reach through</i>
<i>the hatch or any of that.</i>

822
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:42,877
<i>Even if you do get out there</i>

823
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,379
you'll be dragged
by the undertow into the sea.

824
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,446
He's right.

825
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,713
Officer Dunn warns us
every summer

826
00:54:46,715 --> 00:54:47,847
to stay out of the canal.

827
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:50,116
Then what are we
supposed to do? Hmm?

828
00:54:50,118 --> 00:54:53,652
Well, we can't just sit here
and wait to die.

829
00:54:53,654 --> 00:54:56,455
We can do this.
Come on, let's do it.

830
00:54:56,457 --> 00:54:58,557
Let's go! Now!

831
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,859
I don't think I can..
I don't think I can do this.

832
00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:03,395
Of course you can. You're on
the swim team. You can do this.

833
00:55:03,397 --> 00:55:05,463
- <i> Amanda. Amanda.</i>
- <i> I can't do this.</i>

834
00:55:05,465 --> 00:55:08,266
- You go or I swear to God...
- Or you what, Todd?

835
00:55:08,268 --> 00:55:10,201
- Are you gonna shoot her?
- Oh..

836
00:55:10,203 --> 00:55:13,171
Todd, will you put down
the gun? This is not you!

837
00:55:13,173 --> 00:55:14,805
Give me back the gun.

838
00:55:14,807 --> 00:55:16,773
I told you it was a bad idea
bringing this asshole with us.

839
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:20,177
Oh, trust me, Eddie.
I wish I wouldn't have.

840
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:23,180
Now, get ready to swim.

841
00:55:23,182 --> 00:55:24,481
Hey, will you look at me?

842
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:26,884
<i>Look at me, man.</i>

843
00:55:27,752 --> 00:55:29,185
Put down the gun, man.

844
00:55:29,187 --> 00:55:31,388
The air is making you mental.

845
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:38,362
- <i> No, no.</i>
- I am not dying down here!

846
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:40,697
Todd, give me the gun

847
00:55:40,699 --> 00:55:43,300
or I swear I will slit
your throat! That's a promise!

848
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:44,868
Think you're quicker
than my trigger finger?

849
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:45,902
<i>Todd, please.</i>

850
00:55:45,904 --> 00:55:47,836
You wanna try me?

851
00:56:07,058 --> 00:56:09,326
Where's the gun?

852
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:11,261
Here. I got it. I got it.

853
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,330
<i>You fucking idiot, Todd!</i>

854
00:56:26,443 --> 00:56:29,011
I'm going through the hatch.

855
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:30,579
And I am going alone.

856
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:32,281
There's no point
in risking all our lives.

857
00:56:32,283 --> 00:56:34,516
Like Eddie said,
I might not make it.

858
00:56:34,518 --> 00:56:36,184
Wait. Wait, wait.

859
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:38,720
Matt. Matt, you said
the car has GPS, right?

860
00:56:38,722 --> 00:56:40,321
- And it's working?
- Yeah.

861
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:42,356
See? We just have to wait
'cause it's working.

862
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:44,192
And they'll find us.
They'll send divers down here.

863
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:46,827
It'll be too late.

864
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:48,995
<i>The air is already thinning
out and the water is rising.</i>

865
00:56:48,997 --> 00:56:52,198
By the time pressure equalizes,
we'll all be dead.

866
00:56:54,301 --> 00:56:56,136
This could be our only chance.

867
00:56:56,138 --> 00:56:58,371
You sure about this, Brandon?

868
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:04,509
I'll try.

869
00:57:05,444 --> 00:57:06,944
Just get ready
to pop that trunk.

870
00:57:06,946 --> 00:57:08,713
Okay.

871
00:57:09,848 --> 00:57:11,281
Listen, I'll knock
on the roof two times

872
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:13,584
to let you know
that I'm out, okay?

873
00:57:16,621 --> 00:57:19,590
Alright.
Wait, wait, wait, Brandon.

874
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:24,027
I'm gonna do it. No, you can't.

875
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:25,195
No, no, no. No, Brandon.

876
00:57:25,197 --> 00:57:26,696
<i>Brandon, think about it,</i>
<i>alright?</i>

877
00:57:26,698 --> 00:57:28,464
<i>I'm the only one who knows the
current well enough, right?</i>

878
00:57:28,466 --> 00:57:30,532
If I get up there,
I got a direct route.

879
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:34,036
- No. No, no, no. No.
- Amanda. Amanda, please.

880
00:57:34,038 --> 00:57:36,772
<i>I know the current, alright?</i>
<i>No, Eddie. Eddie, no. No!</i>

881
00:57:36,774 --> 00:57:37,874
<i>No! I can get there in a second.</i>

882
00:57:37,876 --> 00:57:40,710
- Amanda, listen to me.
- Why?

883
00:57:40,712 --> 00:57:44,481
Why? Why, why, why?
Listen to me.

884
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:47,083
I got this.

885
00:57:56,994 --> 00:58:00,229
Two knocks and we'll know
you're out.

886
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:03,666
Okay.

887
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:18,147
<i>- Eddie, are you okay?</i>
- Yeah.

888
00:58:18,149 --> 00:58:20,150
<i>Yeah. It's half-flooded.</i>
<i>Water leaking in.</i>

889
00:58:20,152 --> 00:58:22,685
Alright, come back, man. It's not
too late to change your mind.

890
00:58:22,687 --> 00:58:25,221
No, man. Look, I got this.
Alright, just close the hatch.

891
00:58:25,223 --> 00:58:26,622
Are you sure?

892
00:58:26,624 --> 00:58:29,491
Yes, hurry the fuck up, man,
alright, before I lose my nerve.

893
00:58:29,493 --> 00:58:31,861
Matt, pop the trunk.

894
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:39,701
Whoa!

895
00:58:39,703 --> 00:58:41,335
That's not coming
from the roof.

896
00:58:41,337 --> 00:58:43,938
<i>Are you still in there?</i>
<i>What are you doing? Let's go!</i>

897
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,141
- Eddie, get back inside!
- Eddie.

898
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:49,611
- <i> Eddie.</i>
- <i> Matt, open the trunk right now!</i>

899
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:51,946
- The light says it's open.
- <i> What are you doing, Matt?</i>

900
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:53,914
<i>Get him out!</i>
<i>Get him back inside!</i>

901
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,550
That's what I am doing.

902
00:58:56,552 --> 00:58:59,719
Eddie! Eddie!

903
00:59:09,631 --> 00:59:10,731
Fuck!

904
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:12,832
Are you alright?

905
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:22,776
How are you feeling?

906
00:59:22,778 --> 00:59:23,910
You sure you're okay?

907
00:59:23,912 --> 00:59:28,115
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just... give me a minute.

908
00:59:33,423 --> 00:59:35,156
Come on, let's go.
Get back in the car.

909
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:37,892
I said give me
a second, alright?

910
00:59:59,381 --> 01:00:01,216
Everything okay over here?

911
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:03,618
Yeah. Just a sick kid.
We're good.

912
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,987
Come on, let's move.

913
01:00:05,989 --> 01:00:09,391
You'll move alright.
Right the fuck over here.

914
01:00:13,496 --> 01:00:15,997
What's going on?

915
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,098
<i>Get down. Now!</i>

916
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,167
Now!

917
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:22,370
Don't move.

918
01:00:26,775 --> 01:00:28,675
Grab the girl!

919
01:00:28,677 --> 01:00:29,942
Jessie!

920
01:00:29,944 --> 01:00:30,944
<i>Dose her!</i>

921
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,746
Fuck! Jesus!

922
01:00:35,216 --> 01:00:37,083
Shut the fuck up!

923
01:00:37,085 --> 01:00:38,117
My leg!

924
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,154
Jessie!

925
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:13,387
Don't move or I'll blow
his fucking head off!

926
01:01:13,389 --> 01:01:14,955
<i>Shut those fucking kids up!</i>

927
01:01:19,594 --> 01:01:21,027
Oh, my God! Jessie!

928
01:01:21,029 --> 01:01:22,094
- <i> Oh my God!</i>
- <i> Jessie!</i>

929
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:23,261
<i>Jessie!</i>

930
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:24,395
Brandon, get in the car!

931
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:28,165
<i>Get back now!</i>

932
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,448
I'm trying, I'm trying
to get the door and close it!

933
01:01:37,642 --> 01:01:39,409
Jessie, come on!
Jessie, get up!

934
01:01:39,411 --> 01:01:40,576
Get in the car!

935
01:02:01,196 --> 01:02:03,329
Jesus! Get up! Get up!

936
01:02:03,331 --> 01:02:05,397
Go, Matt! Go, go, go!

937
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:08,700
Jessie!

938
01:02:24,885 --> 01:02:25,951
My name is Matt Talbot.

939
01:02:25,953 --> 01:02:27,085
I'm in the Baron Flats

940
01:02:27,087 --> 01:02:28,519
near the East Canal Waterway.

941
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:29,920
A vehicle
with the license plate number

942
01:02:29,922 --> 01:02:32,657
6-0-X-ray-Bravo-4-2-0..

943
01:03:05,723 --> 01:03:08,525
Guys, get up!
Get up! Everybody..

944
01:03:27,613 --> 01:03:29,246
<i>Yo! Who the fuck</i>
<i>are those guys?</i>

945
01:03:29,248 --> 01:03:31,682
Shit! Holy shit!

946
01:05:15,025 --> 01:05:17,026
Down! Over here! I need help!

947
01:05:17,028 --> 01:05:18,193
I need..

948
01:05:18,195 --> 01:05:19,995
Help!

949
01:05:19,997 --> 01:05:22,597
Hey! Help! Over here!

950
01:05:53,065 --> 01:05:56,300
I'm freezing. I'm freezing.

951
01:05:56,302 --> 01:05:58,368
I can't feel my feet.

952
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:01,437
Uhm, hypothermia..

953
01:06:02,972 --> 01:06:05,340
I-is setting in.

954
01:06:05,342 --> 01:06:10,212
We... we can't last
much longer down... here.

955
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:15,918
Oh, I'm sorry, Amanda.

956
01:06:19,056 --> 01:06:21,123
I wasn't gonna shoot you.

957
01:06:22,258 --> 01:06:23,291
I'm sorry.

958
01:06:26,063 --> 01:06:27,795
Okay.

959
01:06:30,165 --> 01:06:32,900
How long since
...since Eddie went out?

960
01:06:34,335 --> 01:06:36,369
Almost half an hour.

961
01:06:37,138 --> 01:06:39,873
It feels like much longer.

962
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,541
Do you think he made it?

963
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:43,877
I keep hoping that.

964
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:45,545
What if..

965
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:47,980
What if he's still back there?

966
01:06:47,982 --> 01:06:50,049
What if, what if he drowned?

967
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,817
Why would you even say that?

968
01:06:52,819 --> 01:06:55,153
I'm just being realistic.

969
01:06:57,689 --> 01:07:00,625
We heard the knocks.

970
01:07:00,627 --> 01:07:03,294
That was the signal.

971
01:07:03,296 --> 01:07:05,062
Mmm.

972
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:06,530
Could've been..

973
01:07:06,532 --> 01:07:08,266
Anything, Brandon.

974
01:07:08,268 --> 01:07:10,067
He made it.

975
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:12,134
That is what we have to believe.

976
01:07:16,672 --> 01:07:18,439
What happens..

977
01:07:18,441 --> 01:07:20,508
When you run out of air?

978
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,077
Your lungs start to hurt.

979
01:07:25,814 --> 01:07:27,381
They already hurt.

980
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:43,863
What are you doing, Todd?

981
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:46,699
This door.

982
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:50,269
It should open by now.

983
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:57,609
Shh. Shh.

984
01:07:57,611 --> 01:07:59,644
What's that?

985
01:07:59,646 --> 01:08:01,847
There it is.
There it is. Listen.

986
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:03,582
You hear it?

987
01:08:04,717 --> 01:08:06,384
Sounds like a boat.

988
01:08:06,386 --> 01:08:08,787
Sounds like a boat.

989
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:11,256
Hey. Hey! Hey!

990
01:08:12,091 --> 01:08:14,026
Hey.

991
01:08:14,028 --> 01:08:15,260
Hey.

992
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:17,562
<i>Are you sure? How do you know?</i>

993
01:08:22,234 --> 01:08:24,001
Help us.

994
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,437
<i>Eddie.</i>

995
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:29,339
No, no, no. There's... there's
no point in screaming.

996
01:08:29,341 --> 01:08:31,642
They can't hear us down here.

997
01:08:31,644 --> 01:08:33,276
They could be using sonar.

998
01:08:33,278 --> 01:08:34,943
Keep yelling!

999
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,146
Help!

1000
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:39,380
Eddie!

1001
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,218
We're down here!

1002
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,320
H- help!

1003
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:49,023
Matt! Jessie! We hear a boat!

1004
01:08:57,131 --> 01:08:59,030
Hey! Help us!

1005
01:08:59,032 --> 01:09:00,594
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1006
01:09:02,636 --> 01:09:03,635
Help!

1007
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:36,571
- Help!
- Help!

1008
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:37,872
Hey!

1009
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,047
- Hey!
- Hey!

1010
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,617
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hey.

1011
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:51,819
- Hey. Hey!
- <i> Hey!</i>

1012
01:09:57,192 --> 01:09:59,593
Oh, my God. Are they gonna
give us a warning first?

1013
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,028
Maybe that was a warning.

1014
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,929
Yeah! We're being rescued!

1015
01:10:08,369 --> 01:10:10,036
We're being rescued!

1016
01:10:13,007 --> 01:10:14,540
Help!

1017
01:10:24,416 --> 01:10:25,816
Hey!

1018
01:10:27,151 --> 01:10:28,351
Help!

1019
01:10:33,624 --> 01:10:35,758
Jessie.

1020
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,293
<i>Jessie.</i>

1021
01:10:42,766 --> 01:10:47,668
Oh, my God! Eddie!

1022
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:49,512
They're not here to rescue us!

1023
01:10:55,778 --> 01:10:58,278
Goddamn it! Amanda!

1024
01:11:23,502 --> 01:11:26,170
Amanda! Amanda!

1025
01:11:27,338 --> 01:11:29,371
Amanda!

1026
01:11:33,609 --> 01:11:35,009
Amanda!

1027
01:11:35,011 --> 01:11:36,945
Do something!

1028
01:11:36,947 --> 01:11:38,913
Why don't you do something?
Come on!

1029
01:11:45,587 --> 01:11:48,055
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

1030
01:11:48,057 --> 01:11:51,092
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1031
01:11:51,094 --> 01:11:52,493
No!

1032
01:12:11,945 --> 01:12:15,682
I'm sorr.. No!

1033
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:34,934
Don't touch me!

1034
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,842
You killed them.

1035
01:12:43,844 --> 01:12:47,412
You - - you killed..
You didn't do anything.

1036
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,850
It's too late.

1037
01:12:52,852 --> 01:12:53,951
They wanted me.

1038
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,386
You should have let them
have me.

1039
01:12:55,388 --> 01:12:56,920
And my friends
would still be alive.

1040
01:12:56,922 --> 01:12:58,955
- They would have killed them.
- You don't know that.

1041
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,924
Yes, I do.

1042
01:13:00,926 --> 01:13:03,825
How long do we have?
We have like...20 minutes?

1043
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:06,160
<i>The air is getting thin.</i>

1044
01:13:10,898 --> 01:13:12,299
Okay.

1045
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:14,934
Okay what?

1046
01:13:14,936 --> 01:13:17,002
You wanna get out of here?

1047
01:13:17,004 --> 01:13:19,605
This is what's gonna happen.

1048
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:21,673
I'm gonna roll down
the partition.

1049
01:13:21,675 --> 01:13:23,241
It's gonna flood.

1050
01:13:23,243 --> 01:13:24,476
The pressure's gonna equalize

1051
01:13:24,478 --> 01:13:26,044
and you're gonna swim
to the back.

1052
01:13:26,046 --> 01:13:29,680
And you should be able to open
the doors.

1053
01:13:29,682 --> 01:13:32,116
And then you swim as fast
as you can to the surface.

1054
01:13:32,118 --> 01:13:34,585
You understand?
I'm not going without you.

1055
01:13:34,587 --> 01:13:37,922
I can't do it without you.
Yes, you can!

1056
01:13:37,924 --> 01:13:39,423
You can.

1057
01:13:39,425 --> 01:13:40,991
And you have to.

1058
01:13:40,993 --> 01:13:42,426
Okay?

1059
01:13:48,065 --> 01:13:49,599
We don't have much time.

1060
01:13:58,174 --> 01:13:59,941
You can do this.

1061
01:13:59,943 --> 01:14:00,976
Matt.

1062
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,044
Look at me.

1063
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:06,748
Quick breaths.

1064
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,015
Okay?

1065
01:14:08,017 --> 01:14:10,350
- Okay.
- Okay.

1066
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:04,876
This doesn't feel good.

1067
01:18:04,878 --> 01:18:06,578
You want me to at least
take in in for you?

1068
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,680
No.

1069
01:18:08,682 --> 01:18:10,782
I've gotta go in alone.

1070
01:18:10,784 --> 01:18:12,584
That was the deal.

1071
01:18:12,586 --> 01:18:14,052
I can't risk putting Jessie
in any more danger

1072
01:18:14,054 --> 01:18:16,354
than she's already in.

1073
01:18:37,944 --> 01:18:40,177
<i>Stop.</i>

1074
01:18:42,981 --> 01:18:45,281
Drop the bag.

1075
01:18:46,449 --> 01:18:48,818
Arms up.

1076
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,761
Keep them up.

1077
01:19:22,823 --> 01:19:24,457
Stop there.

1078
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:25,925
Open the bag.

1079
01:19:35,235 --> 01:19:37,070
One million dollars in cash.

1080
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,672
Now where's my daughter?

1081
01:19:44,345 --> 01:19:45,945
- Jessie!
- Hey!

1082
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,014
Hold the girl!

1083
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:08,436
You've got your money.

1084
01:20:08,438 --> 01:20:10,671
<i>Get away from her.</i>

1085
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,542
Put it down.

1086
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:16,977
Put it down!

1087
01:20:24,687 --> 01:20:27,255
Put it down!

1088
01:20:35,631 --> 01:20:37,599
- It's okay, baby.
- Dad.

1089
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:39,133
I got you, it's okay.

1090
01:20:39,135 --> 01:20:41,735
Give me the keys.

1091
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:43,937
Is she okay?

1092
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:46,472
We need to get her
to a hospital.

1093
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:49,075
Here, call the police.

1094
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,121
My name is Jessie Searles.
I'm..

1095
01:21:00,123 --> 01:21:03,224
Ah! Uh-uh.

1096
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,128
Hi.

1097
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:14,200
Put the guns down or she's dead.

1098
01:21:15,869 --> 01:21:17,336
Oh, give me.

1099
01:21:17,338 --> 01:21:19,872
- Help me!
- Sshh.

1100
01:21:24,244 --> 01:21:27,111
Matt, put the gun down.

1101
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,381
And you too, Mr. Searles.

1102
01:21:30,383 --> 01:21:32,149
Oh, Brandon, please.

1103
01:21:32,151 --> 01:21:34,451
Brandon, please don't. Stop it.

1104
01:21:34,453 --> 01:21:35,785
You're a piece of shit.

1105
01:21:35,787 --> 01:21:38,121
Shut up, Matt.
I mean it, Mr. Searless.

1106
01:21:38,123 --> 01:21:40,123
Put the gun down or she's dead!

1107
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:42,326
Now! Put it down!
I'll fucking kill her!

1108
01:21:42,328 --> 01:21:44,094
I swear to God.
No, I'm just kidding.

1109
01:21:44,096 --> 01:21:45,361
Put the gun down.

1110
01:21:45,363 --> 01:21:47,897
No, but seriously, I will.

1111
01:21:49,699 --> 01:21:52,033
<i>Thanks.</i>

1112
01:21:52,768 --> 01:21:54,603
Sorry, that was dramatic.

1113
01:21:54,605 --> 01:21:57,606
Brandon, please,
don't hurt her.

1114
01:21:57,608 --> 01:21:59,207
He won't.

1115
01:21:59,209 --> 01:22:00,442
Not if he's smart.

1116
01:22:00,444 --> 01:22:02,443
Smart?

1117
01:22:05,213 --> 01:22:07,248
Uh, you, uh..

1118
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,583
You don't think that
I'll actually kill this bitch?

1119
01:22:11,519 --> 01:22:13,420
Huh. Well, you see.

1120
01:22:13,422 --> 01:22:15,288
I-I had no problem taking care

1121
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:17,556
of that asshole brother
of yours.

1122
01:22:20,994 --> 01:22:23,227
Oh, he didn't know.

1123
01:22:24,363 --> 01:22:26,397
Spoiler.

1124
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:27,698
<i>Yeah.</i>

1125
01:22:30,836 --> 01:22:34,271
See, faking the overdose

1126
01:22:34,273 --> 01:22:36,641
that way easy.

1127
01:22:36,643 --> 01:22:39,543
Pretending like I cared

1128
01:22:39,545 --> 01:22:41,678
that was the hard part.

1129
01:22:43,181 --> 01:22:46,149
But, you know, he'd be
a part of all this right now

1130
01:22:46,151 --> 01:22:47,250
if he wouldn't have
pussed out on me

1131
01:22:47,252 --> 01:22:49,286
but that's his life.

1132
01:22:49,288 --> 01:22:50,387
Or not.

1133
01:22:51,355 --> 01:22:52,388
<i>Well, anyway.</i>

1134
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:54,858
Brandon, why?

1135
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:55,992
Why're you doing this to me?

1136
01:22:55,994 --> 01:22:58,995
Oh, I'm not doing this to you.

1137
01:22:58,997 --> 01:23:00,797
No. You see..

1138
01:23:00,799 --> 01:23:03,999
It's your old man
that's on my shit list.

1139
01:23:05,301 --> 01:23:09,704
My mother worked for
that company her whole life.

1140
01:23:11,006 --> 01:23:12,674
<i>And for what?</i>

1141
01:23:12,676 --> 01:23:15,443
So she could be tossed out
with all the trash?

1142
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,614
You see..

1143
01:23:19,616 --> 01:23:22,416
My college fund is drained.

1144
01:23:23,651 --> 01:23:27,388
And, well,
I have... no prospects.

1145
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:31,125
I could make assistant manager

1146
01:23:31,127 --> 01:23:33,894
at the Social, slinging lobster.

1147
01:23:33,896 --> 01:23:35,629
But who wants
to do that, you know?

1148
01:23:35,631 --> 01:23:37,798
It's not really fun.

1149
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,767
Jessie..

1150
01:23:40,769 --> 01:23:43,403
Not all of us get
our lives handed to us

1151
01:23:43,405 --> 01:23:46,038
on a silver fucking platter.

1152
01:23:48,842 --> 01:23:51,109
And if you actually think

1153
01:23:51,111 --> 01:23:53,311
that I really gave
a fuck about you..

1154
01:23:56,582 --> 01:23:59,382
Nope. Bloop.

1155
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:04,220
Well, this has been fun.

1156
01:24:04,222 --> 01:24:05,889
But I'm just here
to get fucking paid.

1157
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:07,523
Shut the fuck up.

1158
01:24:12,695 --> 01:24:15,263
Hector.

1159
01:24:15,265 --> 01:24:17,733
Good help is hard to find.

1160
01:24:20,169 --> 01:24:22,537
What're you doing?

1161
01:24:22,539 --> 01:24:24,606
What is this?

1162
01:24:27,176 --> 01:24:28,676
Atonement.

1163
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:35,649
Irony is..

1164
01:24:35,651 --> 01:24:38,152
I used to respect your family.

1165
01:24:38,154 --> 01:24:39,820
Now you disgust me.

1166
01:24:39,822 --> 01:24:42,723
I disgust you?

1167
01:24:42,725 --> 01:24:45,759
I gave you a job.
I gave you a life.

1168
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:47,560
And this is what
you do to repay me?

1169
01:24:47,562 --> 01:24:49,562
You kidnap my daughter?

1170
01:24:52,098 --> 01:24:54,433
And I thought you were
the man your father was.

1171
01:24:54,435 --> 01:24:56,268
Really? My dad?

1172
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:58,703
You mean the one who worked
at that toxic waste dump

1173
01:24:58,705 --> 01:25:00,138
you called a factory?

1174
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,273
The one who died broke..

1175
01:25:02,275 --> 01:25:04,608
With all those other
families you destroyed.

1176
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:06,811
No, no, I know.
I know it's not personal.

1177
01:25:06,813 --> 01:25:09,280
It's just business.

1178
01:25:09,282 --> 01:25:11,415
You don't get it yet, huh?

1179
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:12,450
But you will.

1180
01:25:12,452 --> 01:25:13,884
I gave you the money.

1181
01:25:13,886 --> 01:25:15,252
What more do you want from me?

1182
01:25:15,254 --> 01:25:17,554
No, no.

1183
01:25:17,556 --> 01:25:20,858
See, that was just,
uh, asshole tax.

1184
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,025
Now that you've seen our faces

1185
01:25:22,027 --> 01:25:24,194
I'm afraid the price
is gonna go up.

1186
01:25:24,196 --> 01:25:26,896
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1187
01:25:26,898 --> 01:25:28,964
You're gonna take your phone..

1188
01:25:28,966 --> 01:25:31,467
And this number here.

1189
01:25:31,469 --> 01:25:34,736
I want you to call
Joyce at the bank.

1190
01:25:34,738 --> 01:25:36,772
That's right,
I know every fucking thing.

1191
01:25:36,774 --> 01:25:38,006
You're gonna tell Joyce

1192
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:40,541
to wire your offshore accounts
to that number.

1193
01:25:42,711 --> 01:25:44,611
- I won't do it.
- No?

1194
01:25:44,613 --> 01:25:47,113
Hank, you gotta
look at this like..

1195
01:25:47,115 --> 01:25:48,982
Like a severance pay.

1196
01:25:48,984 --> 01:25:51,817
You got to see it as
karma comeuppance money.

1197
01:25:52,685 --> 01:25:54,386
'Cause if you don't

1198
01:25:54,388 --> 01:25:56,454
I'm gonna have
my girl right there

1199
01:25:56,456 --> 01:25:59,356
give your girl a face-lift.

1200
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,700
Yeah.

1201
01:26:08,702 --> 01:26:12,204
And as attractive as Carla is

1202
01:26:12,206 --> 01:26:15,039
she is equally persuasive.

1203
01:26:17,275 --> 01:26:18,876
Okay, okay. Okay.

1204
01:26:18,878 --> 01:26:21,211
I'll do it.
Just don't hurt her.

1205
01:26:22,546 --> 01:26:25,782
Manipulative asshole.
Oh, yeah. That's right.

1206
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:29,217
I learned from the best.

1207
01:26:54,211 --> 01:26:56,545
Daddy!

1208
01:27:02,418 --> 01:27:03,551
Uh.

1209
01:27:20,599 --> 01:27:22,933
Stupid... bitch.

1210
01:28:04,241 --> 01:28:05,341
Ah!

1211
01:28:19,925 --> 01:28:21,592
Whoa, whoa! Matt!

1212
01:28:21,594 --> 01:28:24,562
Listen, I need you
to calm the fuck down.

1213
01:28:24,564 --> 01:28:26,297
Now you're a good kid

1214
01:28:26,299 --> 01:28:28,265
but you lack perspective.

1215
01:28:28,267 --> 01:28:30,935
You gotta listen carefully

1216
01:28:30,937 --> 01:28:32,403
to what I'm gonna tell you.

1217
01:28:32,405 --> 01:28:35,172
- I don't wanna hear it.
- <i> Really?</i>

1218
01:28:35,174 --> 01:28:37,041
Matt, they don't care about you

1219
01:28:37,043 --> 01:28:39,309
or your family.

1220
01:28:39,311 --> 01:28:41,044
We're on the deck
of the Titanic.

1221
01:28:41,046 --> 01:28:43,781
<i>This shit is going down</i>
<i>and the rich motherfuckers</i>

1222
01:28:43,783 --> 01:28:45,249
<i>have taken all the lifeboats.</i>

1223
01:28:45,251 --> 01:28:48,519
The vampires have sucked
the middle class dry.

1224
01:28:48,521 --> 01:28:50,720
There's only two classes
now, Matt.

1225
01:28:52,723 --> 01:28:54,991
Have, and have-not.

1226
01:28:54,993 --> 01:28:57,259
<i>Rich and poor.</i>

1227
01:28:57,261 --> 01:28:59,795
Now, you're gonna have
to make that choice, Matt.

1228
01:28:59,797 --> 01:29:02,030
It's tough, but what're you
gonna be?

1229
01:29:03,465 --> 01:29:06,768
You gonna be a have..

1230
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:08,268
<i>Or have-not.</i>

1231
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:12,805
It's time for you
to make that choice.

1232
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:15,274
<i>Come on, Matt.</i>

1233
01:29:15,276 --> 01:29:17,175
I've made my choice.

1234
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,450
Oh, son, you sure
you wanna do this?

1235
01:29:25,452 --> 01:29:27,718
You don't look so good.

1236
01:29:29,287 --> 01:29:31,789
Oh, man. Oh, man.

1237
01:29:31,791 --> 01:29:33,490
I don't wanna hurt you.

1238
01:29:34,658 --> 01:29:35,859
Oh, man.

1239
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:39,161
Alright, listen.

1240
01:29:39,163 --> 01:29:42,131
They want us to fight.
You gotta listen to Hector.

1241
01:29:42,133 --> 01:29:44,766
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1242
01:29:59,782 --> 01:30:01,115
Damn!

1243
01:30:03,051 --> 01:30:04,684
Daddy.

1244
01:30:04,686 --> 01:30:06,753
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

1245
01:30:09,957 --> 01:30:12,192
Kid..

1246
01:30:12,194 --> 01:30:14,561
You'd have been better off
staying in the car.

1247
01:31:39,954 --> 01:31:41,855
Matt.

1248
01:31:41,857 --> 01:31:43,523
It's only been a month,
you sure you up for this?

1249
01:31:43,525 --> 01:31:45,157
Yeah, I'm good.

1250
01:31:45,159 --> 01:31:46,892
Now listen, I took care of everything,
so when you get down there...

1251
01:31:46,894 --> 01:31:48,761
I've got it handled,
Mr. Searles.

1252
01:31:48,763 --> 01:31:50,796
You've already done too much.

1253
01:31:50,798 --> 01:31:52,664
It's never enough
for family, okay?

1254
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:54,800
And would you
call me Hank, please?

1255
01:33:31,004 --> 01:33:32,971
What are you doing?

1256
01:33:32,973 --> 01:33:35,039
I thought I'd drive you
for once.

1257
01:33:50,422 --> 01:33:51,889
Let's go.
