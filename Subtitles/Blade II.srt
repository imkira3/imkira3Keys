1
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:40,762
greetings from scOrp
300MBUNiTED

2
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,762
First time giving blood?

3
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,348
Yes.

4
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,309
They pay cash here,

5
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:02,104
and there's no limit
to how many times you give.

6
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,272
They even buy it
in the jar.

7
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,818
Jared Nomak,
we're ready for you.

8
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,084
In the past 12 months,
have you gotten a tattoo,

9
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,670
or undergone any ear,
skin, or body piercings?

10
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,463
No.

11
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,883
Where did you get
that scar on your chin?

12
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,845
Childhood accident.

13
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,306
You say you don't have any immediate
next of kin, is that right?

14
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,808
Not that I'm
in contact with.

15
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,102
Nobody to call in case
of an emergency?

16
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,271
- No one.
- No family?

17
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:49,943
I told you, no. Are you telling me
I can't be a donor?

18
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,571
It depends.

19
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,115
We came up with some unusual
results on your blood test.

20
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,577
What?
How unusual?

21
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,791
Let me explain. Your blood
has a very rare phenotype,

22
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,252
one we haven't
encountered before.

23
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,799
What? What are you
talking about?

24
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,679
- Who are you? No.
- Sit down, please.

25
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,558
What is this?

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,771
This is a good news-bad news
scenario, Jared.

27
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,606
Good news for us...

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,152
bad news...

29
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,404
...for you.

30
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,513
Forget what you think
you know...

31
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,766
vampires exist.

32
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,730
My name is Blade.

33
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,234
I was born half human,
half vampire.

34
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,072
They call me
'The Daywalker.'

35
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,994
I have all
their strengths,

36
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,538
none of their
weaknesses...

37
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,040
except for 'the thirst.'

38
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,878
20 years ago I met a man
that changed that...

39
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,798
Whistler.

40
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,427
He taught me how to hold
the thirst at bay.

41
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,804
Taught me the rules.

42
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,099
Gave me the weapons
to hunt with...

43
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,269
silver, garlic,

44
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,855
sunlight.

45
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,190
Two years ago
he was attacked.

46
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,775
They took him,

47
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,862
and turned him into
the thing I hate most.

48
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,658
I should have
finished him off.

49
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,785
Now I'm hunting him.

50
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,082
I will find him.

51
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,835
And nothing
will stand in my way.

52
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,652
Daywalker's here!
Stop him!

53
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,959
Where is he?

54
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,256
Hey!

55
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,702
No, no.

56
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,460
Take me to him,

57
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,463
and I'll consider you
a loose end.

58
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,939
Catch you later.

59
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,896
Old man...

60
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,148
look at what
they've done to you.

61
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,079
Let's go home.

62
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,754
Lock up your daughters,
boys and girls,

63
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,797
the dark knight returns.

64
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,515
- Need a toke of the smokage, B?
- Later. Cut the lights.

65
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,648
You found him.

66
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,031
You didn't kill him.

67
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,325
Give me a hand.

68
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,081
I got a bad feeling
about this, B.

69
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,959
Listen to his breathing.
He's already dying.

70
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,504
He's in pain. Why don't you
put him out of his misery?

71
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:01,507
They had him on stasis
in a halfway house.

72
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:04,843
I'm giving him an accelerated
retro-viral detox...

73
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,012
like a heroin addict.

74
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,600
- Make him go cold turkey in one night.
- Shit ain't going to work, man.

75
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,019
I say you kill
the motherfucker right now.

76
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,188
Get out.

77
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,408
If there's anything left
of you in there, Whistler,

78
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,411
listen up.

79
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:35,040
In the morning those blinds
are going to open...

80
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,126
whether you're cured...

81
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,294
or not.

82
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,433
Hey, man,
I didn't mean to call him...

83
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:36,476
Listen to me, Blade.

84
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,729
You're going to have
to finish me off.

85
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,856
No.

86
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,025
Give me
that damn gun.

87
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,409
Now walk away.

88
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,328
Stubborn
son of a bitch.

89
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,756
How do you feel?

90
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,971
Like hammered shit.

91
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,144
How'd you find me?

92
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,190
I started out in Moscow,
then Romania.

93
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:10,070
- They kept moving you around.
- How long was I gone?

94
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:16,243
- Months?
- Too long.

95
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:24,126
Years.

96
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,297
They tortured me
almost to death.

97
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,175
And then let me heal
in a vat of blood

98
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,719
so they could go at it again.

99
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:40,058
Sorry sons of bitches
could have at least

100
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,644
fixed my goddamn leg
while they were at it.

101
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:47,399
Where's my arc welder?

102
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:06,084
Whistler, nice to meet you, man.
I heard a lot about you.

103
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,504
I'm Josh. You can call me 'Scud.'
Everybody does.

104
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,393
Tell me something, Skid...

105
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,021
No, man, it's 'Scud,'
like 'stud.'

106
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:28,607
Whatever.
What did you do in here?

107
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:31,818
The pimpmobile? Just a little
after-market modification.

108
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,279
- Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,449
You gave it a more aggressive
exhaust profile ramping.

110
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,619
The whole package will crank
that Betty up, maybe 300 horsepower.

111
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,830
You'll burn the damned thing out
before your next oil change.

112
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,583
Where did you dig up
this shitbird, anyway?

113
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,418
What the fuck
is your problem, Poppy?

114
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,796
My problem is I've been
sucking blood clots for two years.

115
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:54,883
I get out to find some jerkoff
fucking with my life's work.

116
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,969
We jeopardized our whole operation
to save your puckered arse!

117
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,137
- Our operation?
- Yeah.

118
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,058
Our operation? I built
this operation, you arse-wipe!

119
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:09,481
Motion sensors!
It's on three, gentlemen.

120
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:11,441
Human?

121
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,487
Body temperature, 50.
I'd guess, suckhead.

122
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,704
Fried. They're using
magnesium flares.

123
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,958
They've got
your security system scoped out.

124
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,128
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't trust you...

125
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:18,007
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

126
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,426
Cool outfit.

127
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:28,935
Guard lights!

128
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:29,847
We represent the ruling body
of the Vampire Nation.

129
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:33,017
They're offering you
a truce.

130
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,145
They want to meet
with you.

131
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:40,733
Scud.

132
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,613
Take off your mask.

133
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:54,872
My name is Asad.
This is Nyssa.

134
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:00,920
You have been
our most feared enemy.

135
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,590
But now there's something else
loose on the streets.

136
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:07,051
Something
worse than you.

137
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:23,568
What's so funny?

138
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:27,780
They tell stories about Blade
as 'The Bogeyman.'

139
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:29,657
Frankly,
I'm disappointed.

140
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:33,619
You hear that, B?
She's disappointed.

141
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:37,457
He agreed
to come along so easily.

142
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:41,252
Come on, B, show her.
Pretty please?

143
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:47,633
Semtex.

144
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:49,969
Enough explosives
to level a city block.

145
00:23:52,638 --> 00:23:54,932
You still disappointed?

146
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,832
The guards look human, B.
They're probably familiars.

147
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:40,603
You sure about this?

148
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,064
Well, if I'm not...

149
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:57,453
The true power
of the Vampire Nation lies here.

150
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:10,591
Father?

151
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:22,520
Blade, this is
Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

152
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,819
It has been said,
'Be proud of your enemy

153
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,238
and enjoy his success.'

154
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,282
In that regard,
I should thank you.

155
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:38,244
- For what?
- Eliminating Deacon Frost.

156
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:41,330
You did us a favor.
Karel Kounen.

157
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:46,419
- You're human.
- Barely... I'm a lawyer.

158
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,629
European Health
Consortium.

159
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:52,174
As you may know,
vampirism is...

160
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:56,929
a horrible virus,
carried in the saliva of predators.

161
00:25:56,971 --> 00:26:01,642
In 72 hours, it spreads
through the human bloodstream,

162
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:04,770
creating new
parasitic organs.

163
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:08,149
Like cancer.

164
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,153
Cancer
with a purpose.

165
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:17,950
Unfortunately, viruses evolve, too.
We've encountered a new one.

166
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:20,369
We dubbed it
the "Reaper" strain.

167
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:24,957
And like any good pathogen,
it appears to have found a carrier.

168
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,508
There...
Jared Nomak.

169
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,054
Born a vampire,
but an anomaly like you.

170
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:42,850
Unlike the rest of us,
however,

171
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:48,856
he feeds on not just humans,
but vampires as well.

172
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,941
Looks like he was
doing me a favor.

173
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:53,194
You're missing
the point.

174
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:57,239
Their vampire victims
don't die... they turn.

175
00:26:57,281 --> 00:27:00,117
- They become carriers.
- You've got to understand.

176
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,787
These things are like crack addicts.
They need to feed daily.

177
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:06,665
Nomak's been up
for 72 hours.

178
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:10,169
By our estimates,
there are already a dozen Reapers.

179
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,546
There'll be hundreds
before the week is out.

180
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:16,675
Thousands within a matter of months.
Do the math.

181
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:19,303
Wait. Let me
get this right.

182
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:23,516
You want me
to hunt them... for you?

183
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:25,059
When they are
finished with us,

184
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,978
who do you think
they'll turn on next?

185
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,106
Your precious humans.

186
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:35,277
Not one of them
will be left.

187
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,863
We spent two years training
a small tactical unit...

188
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:40,616
the Bloodpack.
We want you to lead them.

189
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,576
Two years?

190
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:46,080
We've been training
to hunt you.

191
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,587
- So, B-man, what do you think?
- Sounds like a plan.

192
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:55,881
What do you
really think?

193
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:59,301
They're going to fuck us
the first chance they get.

194
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:02,721
We ain't gonna
do this, right?

195
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:05,182
We'll play along for now.

196
00:28:05,224 --> 00:28:08,352
They'll take us in deeper
than we've ever been.

197
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:11,480
Get a chance to see how
their world really ticks.

198
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:14,066
I had enough
of their world.

199
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:16,610
They’re just
shitting bricks

200
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:20,155
because they're no longer
top of the food chain.

201
00:28:20,197 --> 00:28:23,033
Damn, man, I'm really
worried about him.

202
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:26,829
I know he's your friend and all,
but I think you should watch him.

203
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,792
Nobody goes cold turkey
from the thirst in just one night.

204
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:16,170
Looking to get
hooked up?

205
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:18,464
Maybe.
What do you have?

206
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:22,259
No problem.
Horse, Hawaiian ice,

207
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:24,678
whatever you need.

208
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,056
Whatever I need.

209
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:30,476
I like that.
What if I need you?

210
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,701
So, so sweet.

211
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:27,533
They are ready whenever you are,
Daywalker.

212
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:44,007
Blade,
Meet the Bloodpack.

213
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:49,721
Lighthammer, Verlaine,

214
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:53,267
Priest, Snowman,

215
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:56,311
Chupa, and Reinhardt.

216
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:12,494
Hey...

217
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,162
me and the gang
were wondering...

218
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:19,793
What was that?

219
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:23,046
Can you blush?

220
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:26,216
Here we go, Poppy.

221
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:30,345
Oh, I get it.

222
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,472
I see now.

223
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:35,517
You've been training
for two years to take me out,

224
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,894
and now, here I am.

225
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:41,982
Ooh, so exciting,
isn't it?

226
00:31:42,024 --> 00:31:46,028
Okay,
here's your chance.

227
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:49,614
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

228
00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:53,118
Here I am... right here
in front of you.

229
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,120
'Adolf' here gets
the first shot.

230
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:58,874
Come on. What are you looking
at her for? You need permission?

231
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:00,876
Maybe you need a little bit
of incentive.

232
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:02,461
Okay, I can help
with that.

233
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:07,674
What's the matter?
Missed that?

234
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:09,509
It's okay,
I can do it again.

235
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:15,766
Come on.
You need a manual?

236
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:18,435
- Do it! Come on!
- Kill the bastard!

237
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:29,196
Now you've got an explosive device
stuck to the back of your head.

238
00:32:29,237 --> 00:32:33,200
Silver nitrate... rigged to go off
if anybody tampers with it.

239
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:35,869
I'll have
the detonator with me.

240
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:38,872
And you... if you so much
as look at me wrong...

241
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:46,338
From now on,
we work as a unit.

242
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:49,382
You'll be taking
orders from me.

243
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:52,552
Any questions?

244
00:32:58,141 --> 00:32:59,643
Good.

245
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:05,857
You want to catch the hunter?
You start with the prey.

246
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:08,360
We'll target
all the night places

247
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:11,988
where vampires
congregate.

248
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,409
Blood banks, safe houses,
the bigger, the better.

249
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:20,121
So... what's first?

250
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,418
The House of Pain.

251
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:41,726
Where's the entrance?

252
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:45,689
I don't see any signs,
no vampire glyphs.

253
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,068
No, because of you,
we've had to rethink our habits...

254
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,529
tighten our security.

255
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,199
Have a closer look.

256
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:05,375
Nice.

257
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,669
.38,.45 and 9mm
caliber.

258
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:09,546
All with foil capsules
at the tip

259
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:12,132
filled with silver nitrate,
and garlic extract.

260
00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:14,092
This hyper-velocity
stake gun

261
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:18,430
spits out a silver stake
at 6,000 feet per second.

262
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:20,390
Since you suckers
don't like sunlight,

263
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:23,810
we've modified the gun's
entry light with a UVfilter.

264
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:26,563
Pop it open...
instant UV light.

265
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:31,985
- Filter's on, no problem.
- Yo, B, check this out.

266
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:34,195
It's got a pneumatic
syringe delivery system.

267
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:37,699
The vials are filled
with an anti-coagulant called EDTA.

268
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:40,827
One punch with this, you'll blow
your target up like a balloon.

269
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:43,580
The cartridge ejects.
Automatic reload.

270
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:45,957
Nice.

271
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:48,293
Let's go.

272
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,337
You won't pass
for one of us.

273
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:53,089
- Like I give a shit.
- No, he's right.

274
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:56,968
Why don't you post up
on the roof over there?

275
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,095
Cover our backs.

276
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:03,433
So the Bloodpack's calling
the shots now, huh?

277
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:06,227
Great.

278
00:35:07,145 --> 00:35:10,690
Better curb that dog of yours
or we'll do it for you.

279
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:17,280
Keep pushing, arsehole.

280
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:03,201
We're in.

281
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:14,003
You're about
to enter our world.

282
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:16,297
You will see things...
feeding.

283
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,550
Just remember
why you're here.

284
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:21,761
I haven't forgotten.

285
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,652
What exactly are we
looking for in here?

286
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:39,362
Anything that looks
suspicious.

287
00:36:46,953 --> 00:36:49,289
You got to be
kidding me.

288
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:46,054
Scud, do you read me?

289
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,268
- Scud, you reading me?
- Reading you loud and clear, B.

290
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,978
The whole place
is a safe house.

291
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,773
The windows are painted black,
one access door.

292
00:37:56,814 --> 00:37:59,525
- 200, 300 suckheads in here.
- That sounds cool.

293
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:03,237
Hey, W, you got me?

294
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,283
W?

295
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:13,623
Tell me something, how's
the weather up there, sweetheart?

296
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:17,335
Walkin' on sunshine,
toad boy.

297
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:25,468
Look at them...
half of these bastards,

298
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,678
they're not even
purebloods.

299
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,263
I tell you what,

300
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:32,809
why don't we just
fucking kill everyone?

301
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,311
Just to make sure.

302
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:41,401
God, it would be
so easy.

303
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,752
He's got you.

304
00:39:29,907 --> 00:39:32,577
Daywalker.

305
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:48,819
Mother's milk.

306
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:51,864
I say we got about half an hour
till sunrise, Cinderella.

307
00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:54,325
Hurry up.

308
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:13,719
I spotted one,
but lost him.

309
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:16,555
Be on the lookout.

310
00:41:24,188 --> 00:41:26,816
Fuck.

311
00:42:54,778 --> 00:42:58,908
Whistler, man, they're on the roof.
I got them on the roof of my bus.

312
00:43:23,265 --> 00:43:25,184
Shh-hh.

313
00:44:26,286 --> 00:44:28,664
Nomak.

314
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:31,041
Daywalker.

315
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,919
What am I to you?

316
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:36,880
Is the enemy
of my enemy my friend...

317
00:44:36,922 --> 00:44:39,091
or my enemy?

318
00:44:57,943 --> 00:44:59,403
We're under attack!

319
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:01,697
There's three of them.
Probably more.

320
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:12,916
Daylight.

321
00:46:57,187 --> 00:47:00,273
Silver don't do jack shit.
Don't waste the bullets!

322
00:47:00,315 --> 00:47:02,359
- Motherfucker.
- You hear me, Chupa?

323
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:04,528
Say 'cheese.'

324
00:47:21,837 --> 00:47:23,380
Come on.

325
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,504
How about some daylight,
motherfucker?

326
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:03,206
Fuck!

327
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:03,558
Listen to me. If you're under attack,
use your UV lights.

328
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,894
Use your UV lights.
they can't take the light.

329
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:59,155
Priest?
We're not dying here, man.

330
00:51:59,197 --> 00:52:01,658
- Come on.
- Priest is down.

331
00:52:06,538 --> 00:52:10,333
Daylight's coming.
You're on your own, Blade.

332
00:52:33,815 --> 00:52:36,442
You want me so bad,
Blade?

333
00:52:36,484 --> 00:52:39,028
Here I am.

334
00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:43,825
Why kill me?

335
00:52:46,244 --> 00:52:49,706
You and I, we have
the same enemy.

336
00:52:49,747 --> 00:52:51,374
We want
the same thing.

337
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:32,016
We need
the same thing, Blade.

338
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,571
What happened?

339
00:55:26,612 --> 00:55:28,948
Why didn't you tell me
these things were immune

340
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:31,158
- to silver and garlic?
- I didn't know.

341
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,371
If you did,
would you have told me?

342
00:55:35,413 --> 00:55:38,541
I think you know the truth
when you hear it.

343
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:40,668
Mm-hmm.
Then why didn't he kill you?

344
00:55:47,008 --> 00:55:48,801
How long since
he's been bitten?

345
00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:53,055
- About 20 minutes.
- His skin is fucking burning.

346
00:55:53,097 --> 00:55:55,016
He's already
starting to change.

347
00:55:57,768 --> 00:56:00,604
Will someone just
shut him the fuck up?

348
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:21,250
Hold on!

349
00:56:21,292 --> 00:56:23,669
- Hold him, Chupa!
- Come on, man!

350
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:26,047
Put him out of his
fucking misery!

351
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:29,800
Don't you get it?
You can't finish him that way!

352
00:56:29,842 --> 00:56:32,386
Hold him down!
Hold him down, Chupa!

353
00:56:36,223 --> 00:56:37,683
Move.

354
00:56:41,854 --> 00:56:44,273
Back off!

355
00:56:57,787 --> 00:57:00,331
If that was your Bloodpack
Sunday punch, we're in trouble.

356
00:57:00,372 --> 00:57:01,999
This motherfucker
left his post.

357
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:04,585
- He just disappeared.
- Where were you?

358
00:57:04,627 --> 00:57:07,129
Ran into a little
Reaper action myself.

359
00:57:07,171 --> 00:57:11,217
Oh, yeah? How little?
We lost a man... Priest.

360
00:57:11,258 --> 00:57:15,554
You want me to carve
his fucking name on your chest?

361
00:57:15,596 --> 00:57:18,682
Let me show you.

362
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:29,318
Saw it moving in the alley
and followed it down.

363
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,280
Found it just like this.
I think they came through here.

364
00:57:33,322 --> 00:57:37,243
It was trying to crawl back
in the culvert, caught his arm.

365
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:40,204
Been gnawing at it
like a coyote.

366
00:57:42,122 --> 00:57:44,458
Little boy blue.

367
00:57:45,626 --> 00:57:48,212
It's already dying.

368
00:57:48,254 --> 00:57:51,841
I need to examine it
as quickly as possible.

369
00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:54,593
Okay, look for a lever.
Let's open it.

370
00:58:16,824 --> 00:58:18,826
They've made contact
with the Reapers.

371
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:22,705
- Any casualties?
- One so far.

372
00:58:22,746 --> 00:58:26,584
It was not...
Nyssa, I trust?

373
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:29,920
No.

374
00:58:29,962 --> 00:58:33,382
This a dangerous game
you're playing, Damaskinos.

375
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:35,884
Blade is too volatile.

376
00:58:35,926 --> 00:58:38,429
You're not going to be able
to keep manipulating him.

377
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:39,847
You worry too much.

378
00:58:39,888 --> 00:58:44,685
I've been informed by our friend inside
that events are unfolding as scripted.

379
00:58:44,727 --> 00:58:46,895
You've already lost
one of your own.

380
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:50,441
How many more are you
willing to sacrifice?

381
00:58:50,482 --> 00:58:54,361
- Every one.
- Even your own daughter?

382
00:58:58,157 --> 00:59:00,993
Yes. Even her.

383
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,087
Recognize this?

384
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:15,507
The blood bank.
He's one of the guards.

385
00:59:15,549 --> 00:59:18,344
So why is he dying?
What's killing him?

386
00:59:18,385 --> 00:59:21,096
Time.

387
00:59:21,138 --> 00:59:23,390
His metabolism
is burning too fast.

388
00:59:23,432 --> 00:59:27,936
They need fresh blood
every couple of hours,

389
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:30,564
or they'll start feeding
on themselves.

390
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:33,150
Nomak's different.
He's the carrier.

391
00:59:33,192 --> 00:59:37,529
It all started with him,
it'll end with him.

392
01:00:01,762 --> 01:00:04,807
Open the mouth, Scud.

393
01:00:04,848 --> 01:00:07,434
Open the mouth.

394
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:10,062
B, come on.

395
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:11,146
Sissy.

396
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:31,500
Only the tongue
carries the virus.

397
01:00:31,542 --> 01:00:35,003
It is injected
through these barbs.

398
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:38,423
It has bifurcated
masseter muscles.

399
01:00:38,465 --> 01:00:41,885
Overdeveloped,
allowing for a much stronger bite.

400
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:47,140
The jaw structure
remains the same.

401
01:00:47,182 --> 01:00:50,978
But there's no mandible bone.
Squeeze that tooth, Scud.

402
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:04,324
Neurotoxin.

403
01:01:04,366 --> 01:01:07,661
Probably paralyzes their victim
while they feed.

404
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:14,543
Garlic don't work.
Silver, that don't work.

405
01:01:14,585 --> 01:01:16,670
We got to go
with the sunlight, right?

406
01:01:16,712 --> 01:01:18,755
That's deadly
to us, too...

407
01:01:18,797 --> 01:01:21,341
so let's see
what else we can find.

408
01:01:46,992 --> 01:01:49,911
These things are
as different from us

409
01:01:49,953 --> 01:01:52,372
as we are from you.

410
01:01:57,711 --> 01:01:59,838
Look at that.

411
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,049
The heart
is encased in bone.

412
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:04,134
Only the side
is vulnerable.

413
01:02:04,176 --> 01:02:06,386
Good luck getting
a stake through that.

414
01:02:06,428 --> 01:02:09,056
Pull a leg off a spider,
it keeps moving on its own,

415
01:02:09,097 --> 01:02:12,142
essentially trying to walk
without a body attached to it.

416
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:15,937
- What are you doing?
- Hard-wired, right?

417
01:02:21,652 --> 01:02:24,988
What the fuck is that?

418
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:28,700
Brain's dead.
Body's still trying to feed.

419
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,456
We got six hours before sunrise.
Be ready by then.

420
01:02:34,498 --> 01:02:36,208
Hey...

421
01:02:36,249 --> 01:02:39,044
what happens
at sunrise?

422
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:44,508
Blade, I'm talking to you.
What happens at sunrise?

423
01:02:46,134 --> 01:02:48,595
- We hunt.
- In broad daylight?

424
01:02:48,637 --> 01:02:50,722
You got be fucking joking.

425
01:02:50,764 --> 01:02:53,392
You better get you
some sunscreen, buttercup.

426
01:02:53,433 --> 01:02:54,976
Listen, shitkicker,

427
01:02:55,018 --> 01:02:57,521
you're about one cunt hair away
from hillbilly heaven.

428
01:02:57,562 --> 01:03:00,857
I love it
when you talk dirty.

429
01:03:03,443 --> 01:03:07,781
Sunlight's the only edge we've got.
They'll be more vulnerable then.

430
01:03:07,823 --> 01:03:09,908
And so will we.

431
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,912
Let's be real
about one thing...

432
01:03:13,954 --> 01:03:18,166
I don't expect everybody
to make it back tomorrow.

433
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:20,418
Remember to protect
yourselves...

434
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,462
at all times.

435
01:03:30,554 --> 01:03:33,932
- What are you looking for?
- Phosphor rods.

436
01:03:33,974 --> 01:03:36,726
If I can suss out the light source,
maybe I can make

437
01:03:36,768 --> 01:03:39,604
some sort of UVflash-bang grenade
or something.

438
01:03:39,646 --> 01:03:41,398
It's been tried already.

439
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:44,234
But you didn't have the Scudster
working on it then, did you?

440
01:03:57,122 --> 01:03:59,082
- Blade.
- Hmm?

441
01:03:59,124 --> 01:04:02,711
- The way you talk to them... us.
- What is it?

442
01:04:02,752 --> 01:04:05,172
We are together in this,
remember?

443
01:04:05,213 --> 01:04:08,049
Why do you hate us
so much?

444
01:04:08,091 --> 01:04:09,968
It's fate.

445
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:13,597
- It's in my blood.
- It's in mine, too.

446
01:04:13,638 --> 01:04:17,183
I'm a pureblood.
I was born a vampire.

447
01:04:22,147 --> 01:04:24,107
You know the thirst
better than any of us...

448
01:04:24,149 --> 01:04:26,276
shooting that serum
of yours.

449
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:28,403
The only difference
between us,

450
01:04:28,445 --> 01:04:31,656
is that I made peace
with what I am a long time ago.

451
01:04:38,955 --> 01:04:40,999
How long have you
known Blade, anyway?

452
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,626
Going on 20 years.

453
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:45,795
He doesn't talk
about the old days that much.

454
01:04:45,837 --> 01:04:48,423
Blade doesn't talk
about anything much.

455
01:04:48,465 --> 01:04:50,717
You want to hear
something funny?

456
01:04:50,759 --> 01:04:56,014
Blade kind of looks at you
like a father figure.

457
01:04:56,056 --> 01:04:57,891
Tell me something.

458
01:04:57,933 --> 01:05:00,018
How'd you two hook up?

459
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,020
I was backpacking.

460
01:05:02,062 --> 01:05:05,065
I met these two chicks,
decided to take them back

461
01:05:05,106 --> 01:05:08,109
to my tent for a little
'Three's Company' action.

462
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:10,236
- Pretty.
- Next thing I know,

463
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:12,739
'Janet' and 'Chrissy' start
tearing chunks out of my stomach.

464
01:05:12,781 --> 01:05:16,034
Blade shows up,
saves my arse.

465
01:05:16,076 --> 01:05:18,828
Everything else just sort
of fell into place.

466
01:05:21,414 --> 01:05:24,084
- Let's try it.
- Alright.

467
01:05:36,638 --> 01:05:38,682
Maybe I fucked up.
Maybe you were right.

468
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:47,982
Alright.
Papa's got a brand new bag.

469
01:06:27,105 --> 01:06:29,399
Let me ask
one question.

470
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:31,443
How the hell are we going
to find these Reapers?

471
01:06:31,484 --> 01:06:35,196
We won't have to.
They'll come to us.

472
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:43,037
- What is this shit?
- Pheromones.

473
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,039
Harvested from the Reapers'
adrenal glands.

474
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:47,584
They're going
to key to it.

475
01:06:49,752 --> 01:06:53,715
They want us to spray on
some suckpuppy's nut juice?

476
01:06:55,341 --> 01:06:56,968
First use your firearms
to drive them back,

477
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,262
then toss your UV grenades.

478
01:06:59,304 --> 01:07:01,723
Right on. This is what we got
for the grand finale.

479
01:07:01,764 --> 01:07:05,977
I hot-wired a couple of these babies
to a nitro-vacuum.

480
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:08,229
Just be real careful
where you pop your load.

481
01:07:08,271 --> 01:07:11,107
And you,
you're not coming?

482
01:07:11,149 --> 01:07:14,068
No. I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

483
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:17,030
UVs have
a 10-second delay.

484
01:07:19,032 --> 01:07:23,286
Nyssa... just remember
to take cover.

485
01:07:24,871 --> 01:07:28,458
Hey, Blade, give me a hand.

486
01:07:31,169 --> 01:07:35,423
You and 'Miss Muffet'
getting a little cozy there?

487
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:38,426
I wouldn't worry
about that if I was you.

488
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:41,346
Looks to me like
you're getting confused

489
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:44,474
as to which side of the line
you're standing on.

490
01:07:44,515 --> 01:07:47,810
Those are real hollow words
coming from a man

491
01:07:47,852 --> 01:07:51,105
who just spent two years
running with the enemy.

492
01:07:51,147 --> 01:07:53,816
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

493
01:07:53,858 --> 01:07:57,236
You know, Whistler,
there's an old saying...

494
01:07:57,278 --> 01:08:00,323
'Keep your friends
close,

495
01:08:00,365 --> 01:08:03,034
but keep
your enemies closer.'

496
01:08:03,076 --> 01:08:05,703
You might want
to remember that.

497
01:08:29,894 --> 01:08:33,189
Blade, we should split
into three units.

498
01:09:45,636 --> 01:09:48,514
We're trying to attract them,
not scare them off.

499
01:09:48,556 --> 01:09:51,434
Yeah? Well, some of us
can't see in the dark,

500
01:09:51,476 --> 01:09:54,270
you fucking nipplehead.
What am I supposed to do?

501
01:09:54,312 --> 01:09:57,815
Bifocals, 'Grandpa.'
and try to keep up.

502
01:10:54,747 --> 01:10:56,457
Let's do this.

503
01:11:02,171 --> 01:11:03,673
Hey, hillbilly.

504
01:11:03,714 --> 01:11:06,801
What the fuck you doing?

505
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:09,428
Ain't nobody here
but you...

506
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:11,472
and us, 'buttercup.'

507
01:11:14,392 --> 01:11:17,770
We lose a partner,
and Blade loses one!

508
01:11:24,402 --> 01:11:28,072
I'll leave you two lovebirds
some time to yourselves.

509
01:12:04,692 --> 01:12:06,861
Verlaine?

510
01:12:37,349 --> 01:12:40,060
Yah!

511
01:13:01,457 --> 01:13:04,668
I spotted a group
in the east tunnel.

512
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:07,838
I'm prepping
the bomb pack.

513
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,840
Nyssa.

514
01:13:32,488 --> 01:13:34,198
Get out!

515
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,908
Right now!

516
01:13:39,536 --> 01:13:41,288
No!

517
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:46,210
No!

518
01:13:48,837 --> 01:13:51,590
I'll attract them to me.
Do what I tell you.

519
01:13:51,632 --> 01:13:53,384
Move!

520
01:13:55,302 --> 01:13:57,096
10...

521
01:13:57,096 --> 01:13:59,014
nine...

522
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:00,808
eight...

523
01:14:00,849 --> 01:14:02,476
seven...

524
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:04,687
six...

525
01:14:04,728 --> 01:14:06,981
five...

526
01:14:07,022 --> 01:14:09,400
four...

527
01:14:09,441 --> 01:14:11,652
three...

528
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:13,862
two...

529
01:14:15,614 --> 01:14:16,907
...one.

530
01:14:40,097 --> 01:14:43,559
Piece of junk.

531
01:14:56,947 --> 01:14:59,366
What the hell is this?

532
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:03,078
You trying to stink me
to death, old man?

533
01:15:13,756 --> 01:15:15,382
Wait!

534
01:15:17,134 --> 01:15:19,303
- You okay?
- Yeah.

535
01:15:19,344 --> 01:15:22,806
We've got to move.
We've got a lot of company.

536
01:15:26,226 --> 01:15:29,229
All units, regroup.
Regroup!

537
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,134
Eat shit,
you ugly motherfuckers!

538
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:02,679
There's nobody left!

539
01:16:22,574 --> 01:16:25,077
- Where's the bomb pack?
- Had to leave it down that tunnel.

540
01:16:25,118 --> 01:16:26,828
Give me the rest
of the pheromones.

541
01:16:29,915 --> 01:16:33,168
Go down that tunnel!
Go, go, go, go!

542
01:16:34,878 --> 01:16:37,923
You obviously
do not know...

543
01:16:37,965 --> 01:16:40,968
whom you are
fucking with!

544
01:17:16,962 --> 01:17:17,963
By the way, Blade...

545
01:17:18,005 --> 01:17:21,216
did I happen to mention
the bomb lever is stuck?

546
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:28,932
Suck this!

547
01:17:31,143 --> 01:17:33,228
Let's go!

548
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,812
You want a bite of me?
Well, come on!

549
01:18:15,854 --> 01:18:17,522
Come on, motherfucker!

550
01:19:35,308 --> 01:19:38,478
Whistler...

551
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,563
wait.

552
01:19:39,604 --> 01:19:42,440
You will survive this

553
01:19:42,482 --> 01:19:45,277
only to tell Blade...

554
01:19:45,318 --> 01:19:47,571
about this ring.

555
01:19:47,612 --> 01:19:52,867
About the truth.
The truth, old man.

556
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:57,581
Damaskinos...

557
01:20:04,921 --> 01:20:07,882
Nyssa...

558
01:21:34,552 --> 01:21:37,722
You've done a great job.

559
01:21:37,764 --> 01:21:40,934
Not that great...
I'd say.

560
01:22:03,414 --> 01:22:07,544
What is it,
my daughter?

561
01:22:55,592 --> 01:22:58,136
They took them.

562
01:22:58,177 --> 01:23:00,555
All our weapons.
Even your sword.

563
01:23:00,597 --> 01:23:02,890
Somebody's been keeping tabs
on us from inside.

564
01:23:02,932 --> 01:23:06,060
- Where are we?
- Some kind of chamber

565
01:23:06,102 --> 01:23:07,478
deep in their lair.

566
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,942
They smashed up everything...
the workshop, all of it.

567
01:23:12,984 --> 01:23:16,237
They've been lying
to us from day one.

568
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:19,532
The Reaper strain
didn't evolve...

569
01:23:19,574 --> 01:23:21,159
it was designed.

570
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,910
What?

571
01:23:22,952 --> 01:23:27,290
Designed. Nomak told me.
I saw him back in the sewers.

572
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:30,376
- He let me live.
- Did he?

573
01:23:30,418 --> 01:23:33,046
How generous of him.

574
01:23:33,087 --> 01:23:37,759
I brought you here to see
the fruits of our labor.

575
01:23:40,845 --> 01:23:42,430
For years I've struggled

576
01:23:42,472 --> 01:23:47,602
to rid our kind of any
hereditary weaknesses.

577
01:23:47,643 --> 01:23:51,814
And so,
recombining DNA...

578
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:55,234
was simply the next
logical step.

579
01:23:56,527 --> 01:24:00,740
Nomak was the first.
A failure.

580
01:24:00,782 --> 01:24:02,367
But in time,

581
01:24:02,408 --> 01:24:05,370
there will be a new
pure race,

582
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:08,289
begotten
from my own flesh,

583
01:24:08,331 --> 01:24:11,376
immune to silver,

584
01:24:11,417 --> 01:24:14,420
soon even sunlight.

585
01:24:14,462 --> 01:24:17,507
I got a question for you,
you lying son of a bitch.

586
01:24:17,548 --> 01:24:20,551
You want to explain how Nomak
got ahold of this ring?

587
01:24:31,229 --> 01:24:35,358
I would have thought
that was obvious at this point.

588
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:39,529
I gave it to him, of course.
A gift from father to son.

589
01:24:50,748 --> 01:24:53,709
I thought
he'd never leave.

590
01:24:59,006 --> 01:25:03,261
The wolf has lain
with the sheep long enough.

591
01:25:03,302 --> 01:25:07,515
Reinhardt, you can kiss
your arse goodbye.

592
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:16,566
I'm sorry, man.

593
01:25:16,607 --> 01:25:20,403
B, you're wasting your time, man.
The bomb's a dud.

594
01:25:20,444 --> 01:25:22,280
It was never supposed
to explode.

595
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:26,158
It was just supposed
to make you feel in control.

596
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,244
You thought you had me
on a short leash,

597
01:25:28,286 --> 01:25:30,663
didn't you, 'jefe'?

598
01:25:35,918 --> 01:25:38,462
Much better.

599
01:25:42,049 --> 01:25:45,094
See this?

600
01:25:45,136 --> 01:25:47,471
I'm one of Damaskinos'
familiars.

601
01:25:47,513 --> 01:25:50,266
They needed my help to bring you here
to control Nomak.

602
01:25:50,308 --> 01:25:52,560
The old fuck,
he was always just bait.

603
01:25:52,602 --> 01:25:56,814
I mean, look at him.
He's your only real weakness, man.

604
01:25:56,856 --> 01:26:00,151
You may be fast, you may be strong
and all that other bullshit,

605
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,987
but in the end, B,
you’re just too human!

606
01:26:04,322 --> 01:26:06,365
Well, you little shit.

607
01:26:10,745 --> 01:26:13,372
You think they scoped out
my security system?

608
01:26:13,414 --> 01:26:18,794
I let them in, arsehole!
I practically handed them the keys.

609
01:26:18,836 --> 01:26:20,671
You heard 'Cue Ball,' right?

610
01:26:20,713 --> 01:26:24,050
Pretty soon they're all
going to be daywalkers, man.

611
01:26:24,091 --> 01:26:27,386
When that happens,
I'd rather be a pet than cattle.

612
01:26:27,428 --> 01:26:29,263
You got me, B?

613
01:26:29,305 --> 01:26:32,350
What do you think
about that, man?

614
01:26:32,391 --> 01:26:36,187
Two things... one...

615
01:26:36,228 --> 01:26:40,483
I've been onto you
since they turned you.

616
01:26:40,524 --> 01:26:42,485
And two...

617
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:45,446
it's not a dud.

618
01:26:46,906 --> 01:26:48,407
Aw, great.

619
01:26:56,624 --> 01:26:59,043
I was just starting
to like him.

620
01:26:59,085 --> 01:27:00,086
Take him down!

621
01:27:34,203 --> 01:27:37,748
We're going to harvest your blood,
every drop of it.

622
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:41,961
Then bone marrow,
organs, everything.

623
01:27:42,002 --> 01:27:46,465
We'll find the missing key
to creating daywalkers.

624
01:27:53,514 --> 01:27:55,224
Now this might
hurt a bit.

625
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:01,564
Nice.

626
01:28:02,648 --> 01:28:05,860
I wonder...

627
01:28:05,901 --> 01:28:08,404
how many vampires
he's killed with this thing.

628
01:28:08,445 --> 01:28:10,865
Not nearly enough,
Fritz.

629
01:28:10,906 --> 01:28:13,284
Keep talking,
honky-tonk.

630
01:28:13,325 --> 01:28:16,537
Just makes my sending you
to the next world

631
01:28:16,537 --> 01:28:19,665
- all the sweeter.
- Been there, done that.

632
01:28:19,707 --> 01:28:24,128
Do your worst, chickenshit.
We'll settle up after.

633
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:48,193
What else
should I find out?

634
01:28:48,235 --> 01:28:50,404
I trusted you...

635
01:28:50,446 --> 01:28:52,907
with my men;

636
01:28:52,948 --> 01:28:55,743
with my will;

637
01:28:55,784 --> 01:28:58,579
with my life.

638
01:28:58,621 --> 01:29:01,040
You...

639
01:29:01,081 --> 01:29:04,335
you sent us out there.

640
01:29:04,376 --> 01:29:07,588
You sent me to die.

641
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,217
Our enemy saved
my life twice,

642
01:29:12,259 --> 01:29:15,804
and you have used us...
your own children.

643
01:29:18,182 --> 01:29:20,559
Make no mistake, Nyssa,

644
01:29:20,601 --> 01:29:23,729
those blood ties
mean nothing to me

645
01:29:23,771 --> 01:29:26,148
when measured against
the ascendancy of our race.

646
01:29:28,275 --> 01:29:32,279
Who do you think
God really favors in the web?

647
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:38,118
The spider,
or the fly?

648
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:44,917
Nomak...

649
01:29:49,296 --> 01:29:52,257
What about him, hmm?

650
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:55,177
He wants revenge...

651
01:29:55,219 --> 01:30:00,641
on the people...
who created him.

652
01:30:00,683 --> 01:30:02,893
You may be right.

653
01:30:02,935 --> 01:30:08,482
But fortunately for us,
he doesn't know this location.

654
01:30:10,526 --> 01:30:13,070
Now...

655
01:30:13,112 --> 01:30:15,614
he does.

656
01:30:43,559 --> 01:30:45,894
What the fuck?

657
01:31:39,698 --> 01:31:41,283
Come on, kid.

658
01:31:41,325 --> 01:31:44,453
Don't you even think
about dying on me.

659
01:31:44,494 --> 01:31:49,958
You didn't give up on me,
I won't give up on you.

660
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,461
Come on... Blade.

661
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,637
Blood...

662
01:32:01,678 --> 01:32:04,514
Yeah.

663
01:32:04,556 --> 01:32:07,351
Blood.

664
01:32:42,886 --> 01:32:44,888
Father!

665
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:47,391
He'll never enter here.

666
01:32:54,147 --> 01:32:55,482
Father!

667
01:33:20,799 --> 01:33:23,093
Father!

668
01:33:51,705 --> 01:33:54,040
Go on, kid.

669
01:33:56,251 --> 01:33:57,335
Go!

670
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:16,975
Go! Get him!

671
01:36:30,864 --> 01:36:31,990
Get in there!

672
01:36:46,212 --> 01:36:50,091
Hmm. Well...

673
01:36:50,133 --> 01:36:53,887
like my daddy said
right before he killed my mum,

674
01:36:53,928 --> 01:36:56,681
'You want anything done right,
you got to do it yourself.'

675
01:37:00,685 --> 01:37:03,229
He also said...

676
01:37:18,495 --> 01:37:20,914
Can you blush?

677
01:37:34,844 --> 01:37:36,971
Hey, kid.

678
01:38:16,135 --> 01:38:19,055
I reset
the security code.

679
01:38:19,097 --> 01:38:22,475
We're locked in.

680
01:38:22,517 --> 01:38:25,853
Are you insane?

681
01:38:25,895 --> 01:38:29,315
- He'll kill us both.
- Yes.

682
01:38:30,566 --> 01:38:33,528
Isn't it sad that you die
not by the hand of your enemy,

683
01:38:33,569 --> 01:38:36,614
but by that
of your own children?

684
01:38:46,833 --> 01:38:48,710
Father.

685
01:40:21,886 --> 01:40:24,555
Nyssa...

686
01:41:14,939 --> 01:41:16,607
Nomak!

687
01:41:20,861 --> 01:41:23,447
Blade, it could end
right here.

688
01:41:23,489 --> 01:41:26,993
What do you think, huh?

689
01:44:22,293 --> 01:44:23,210
After all...

690
01:44:23,294 --> 01:44:26,547
it looks like I've finished
my father’s job.

691
01:45:26,357 --> 01:45:29,568
It's strange.

692
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:32,780
It hurts...

693
01:45:32,821 --> 01:45:35,365
it hurts no more.

694
01:46:34,424 --> 01:46:37,094
It won't be long.

695
01:46:37,135 --> 01:46:41,640
I can already feel it
burning inside of me.

696
01:46:44,977 --> 01:46:49,189
I want to die while
I'm still a vampire.

697
01:47:01,618 --> 01:47:04,746
I want to see the sun.

698
01:48:38,507 --> 01:48:40,509
By booth number three.

699
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:43,053
Enjoy, man.

700
01:48:47,766 --> 01:48:51,728
Are you sure that
the girls are live?

701
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:53,563
Last time I checked.

702
01:48:53,605 --> 01:48:55,315
Thank you.

703
01:48:55,357 --> 01:48:58,985
A couple of razor-blades,
just in case...

704
01:49:06,284 --> 01:49:09,371
You didn't think I forgot
about you, did you?
