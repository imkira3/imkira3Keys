1
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,112
- Aloha.
- What?

2
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,407
Bye-bye.

3
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,808
Stitch, why are you doing this?

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,646
Please stop.

5
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,784
Stop it, Stitch. Don't...

6
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,997
No! Stitch!

7
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,126
Wake up! Wake up!

8
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,795
Wake up, Stitch. Wake up.

9
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,214
Stitch, wake up.

10
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,801
It's all right. Don't worry.

11
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,221
You were just having
another nightmare.

12
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,974
Seems like a bad one.

13
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,060
You know what this means, don't you?

14
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,398
Very interesting.

15
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,316
Why don't you tell me
what happened next?

16
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,068
Well...

17
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,074
- I see.
- Then...

18
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,328
And then...

19
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,832
That's it. No more.

20
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:52,087
It's my professional opinion
that you're afraid of turning bad again.

21
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,506
We need to test your goodness level.

22
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,178
For example, someone bad would
let this Elvis Blue Hawaii lamp,

23
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,057
circa 1971,
smash to pieces against that wall.

24
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:09,271
Or let my favorite book,
Plastic Surgeries Gone Wrong,

25
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,399
drop out this window to be lost forever.

26
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:20,824
Or let his family member
fall to her painful, crushing death.

27
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,868
No!

28
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,955
See?
Look at all the good things you did.

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,375
My prognosis?
Your goodness level is extra high.

30
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,086
Nothing to worry about.

31
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,300
Lilo! Stitch!
You're gonna be late for hula class.

32
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,052
Except that.

33
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,724
Stitch!

34
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,061
Hurry up, you two.

35
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,731
Hey, can you guys help me today?
It's family night.

36
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,400
- I want the house clean.
- Not me.

37
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59,154
I have very important project
I've been working on.

38
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,074
No more crop circles!

39
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,409
All the other aliens get to make them.

40
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,580
- What about you?
- I have a full day of Earth research.

41
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,416
Watching talk shows
and reading magazines?

42
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,293
Yeah, it takes it out of ya.

43
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,671
Can we take the hovercraft? Please?

44
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,341
It's too dangerous.
Besides, someone may see you.

45
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,593
- Please?
- Please?

46
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,014
All right,
you can take it if you can find it.

47
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,432
Yes!

48
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,977
I hid it so good this time, they're never...

49
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,688
Thanks, Nani.

50
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,191
I gotta find
a better hiding place for that thing.

51
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,282
There's no place I'd rather be

52
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,786
Lingering in the ocean blue

53
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,664
Sorry!

54
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,709
I'd surf till the sun sets
beyond the horizon

55
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:02,801
Flying by
on a Hawaiian rollercoaster ride

56
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,987
Hawaiian rollercoaster ride

57
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,574
There's no place I'd rather be

58
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,914
Girls, I have very exciting news.

59
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,584
This week is our May Day...

60
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,337
Sorry I'm late. But wait till you see this.

61
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,922
I got my 'uli'uli technique down.

62
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,382
Lilo...

63
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,348
Lilo?

64
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,519
Lilo, we're not doing that today.

65
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,605
We're not doing that today.

66
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,864
Kumu has an announcement.

67
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:10,660
In three days
is our town's May Day celebration.

68
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,454
And here's the best part.

69
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,248
There will be a hula competition.

70
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,876
Each of you will create an original hula.

71
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,546
The one that
best expresses the aloha spirit

72
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,216
will lead our halau
as the winning dance.

73
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,842
You, you, you!

74
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,887
- Are there any questions?
- Kumu, I have one.

75
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:33,141
Will people who are late to class
be allowed to participate?

76
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,729
Mertle, I think in the spirit of aloha,
we should be tolerant of others.

77
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,856
Well, there's no harm in asking.

78
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:45,320
I want you to use class time today
to begin working on your ideas.

79
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,906
The May Day celebration is big time.

80
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,658
The whole town will be there.

81
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,910
Maybe I'll get a contract.

82
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,789
We can do any idea we want.
Even make our own costumes.

83
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,958
- Cool!
- It'll be a lot of work.

84
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,544
My mom knows
how to make great costumes.

85
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,629
My mom can sew really good.

86
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,799
My mom knows a lot about hula.
She can help me with it.

87
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,802
- I guess Lilo's on her own.
- She doesn't have a mom.

88
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,304
- Don't say that.
- It's the truth.

89
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,808
- Not everyone has a mom.
- All right, don't bite my head off.

90
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,436
I don't know
what costume I'm gonna wear.

91
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,106
Lilo, may I speak with you?

92
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,279
This is a book of past winners.

93
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,614
Do you know who this is?

94
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,409
It's your mother.

95
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,203
- My mom?
- Aye.

96
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,457
She won the competition
when she was your age.

97
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:43,962
She was as beautiful as an orchid
and as graceful as a rolling wave.

98
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,216
Here. To inspire you.

99
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,140
That's my mom.

100
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,435
She won the competition
when she was my age.

101
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,486
Hey, Lilo.

102
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:12,657
Maybe your dog can take a picture
of me when I win the competition.

103
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,369
- How do you know you'll win?
- It's pretty well known

104
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,581
that I'm the best dancer
in the seven-year-old division.

105
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,709
I don't know. I think maybe I can win.

106
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,877
Hello?

107
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,006
You're a stinky dancer, and anything
you come up with will be stinky.

108
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,512
You'll never be like your mom. Never.

109
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,057
- Okay.
- That's it!

110
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,683
Smile.

111
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,694
As you can see,
there was a little disagreement...

112
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,863
Again.

113
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,866
Next time, flush the evidence.

114
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,163
Why don't you come inside, Kumu?
Excuse the mess.

115
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,625
We have a full house.

116
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,546
Make yourself at home, Kumu.
I just made some lemonade.

117
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,214
Hey!

118
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,299
Nani, we're out of lemonade.

119
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,510
Pleakley, I just made that.

120
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,556
Nani. You have to come to lab
and see my new invention.

121
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,057
I just mopped in here!

122
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,768
It will improve your primitive earthly life.

123
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,478
Speaking of improving your life,

124
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:28,191
I've just been reading this article
called Ten Days To A Slimmer You.

125
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,569
Full of wonderful suggestions.

126
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,364
Guys, I don't have time for this.
We have a guest.

127
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,366
A guest? Well, let's go meet him.

128
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,077
Let's not. Lilo's in enough trouble.

129
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,789
- Trouble?
- Well, all out of lemonade.

130
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:48,587
Anyway, I know my sister
is very sorry and didn't mean it.

131
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,797
- Very sorry.
- See?

132
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,549
- But I did mean it.
- Lilo?

133
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,802
Next time,
Mertle Edmonds is going down.

134
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,846
She's going way down.

135
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,975
No more pro wrestling for you.

136
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,604
Where is she? Where is she?

137
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:12,611
There's our precious angel, who must
be the victim of a misunderstanding.

138
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,613
- No, no...
- Where is she?

139
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,658
- Jumba. What are you doing?
- Don't worry. The cavalry has arrived.

140
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,744
- There she is.
- No, no, no, no.

141
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,623
Somebody give this kid gold star,
she's so good.

142
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,124
I don't believe we've met.

143
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,837
This is Uncle Jumba and
I'm Auntie Pleakley. Enchantée.

144
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,132
On second thought, Kumu,
we should talk outside.

145
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,301
It's not polite to interrupt your auntie.

146
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,886
- Knock, knock.
- David.

147
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,971
How's it, everybody?

148
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,726
You remember my Auntie Pleakley
and Uncle Jumba, right?

149
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,354
Say something.

150
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,317
- Nice hat.
- Why, thank you, David.

151
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,445
See? Uncle Jumba
said it made me look top-heavy.

152
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,447
Aunt Pleakley wanted the truth.

153
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,743
What we want and what we need
are entirely different things.

154
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,328
It's true what they say.

155
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,622
Men are from Mars,
and women are from Venus.

156
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,957
- Nani.
- Yeah?

157
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,835
You've been stressing,
so I got movie tickets.

158
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,545
Movie?

159
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:17,133
David, I would love to, really,
but I'm gonna have to rain check.

160
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,513
- That's okay. I understand.
- Great. Thanks for understanding.

161
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,809
I dare you to say that's not flattering,
even on him.

162
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,937
Okay, I'm sure that Kumu
isn't interested in this.

163
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,773
- Nice to be meeting you.
- Au revoir.

164
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,108
Bye-bye.

165
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,695
Boy. Good thing we were here.

166
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,197
I'm not talking to you.

167
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,409
Sorry about the relatives, Kumu.

168
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,829
Yeah, sorry. Thanks for coming.
See ya at the competition.

169
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,041
Lilo?

170
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,925
I know you want to be
in the competition,

171
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,554
but your behavior today
makes me think you're not ready.

172
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,806
No. I'm ready. It's just...

173
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,645
Mertle pushed my buttons.
I'll be good. I mean it.

174
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,900
I hope so. If there's any more trouble,
you won't be allowed in the competition.

175
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:20,071
I promise. There won't be any trouble.
I promise, promise.

176
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,407
I triple promise.

177
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,660
- Okay, then.
- Thank you, Kumu.

178
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,080
You don't have to worry.
I've seen the error of my ways.

179
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,959
I will be good from now on
and be the best hula dancer ever.

180
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,711
You'll see. I can do it.

181
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,005
There's no way I can do this.

182
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,638
Just because my mom was
a great hula dancer doesn't mean I am.

183
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:51,644
The only thing I know
I inherited from her is, well, Nani.

184
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,652
What if Mertle's right
and everything I do is gonna be stinky?

185
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,906
Maybe I'm just stinky...

186
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,325
Like cheese.

187
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:16,211
But my mom was beautiful
like an orchid and graceful like a wave.

188
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,302
I'll never be like her.

189
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,833
You think I can do it?

190
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,460
We do together.

191
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,632
Let's win this thing.

192
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,384
- Okey...
- Dokey.

193
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,136
Hula ideas, take one.

194
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,222
Mummies.

195
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,519
Amputation.

196
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,021
Vampire bats.

197
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,690
Recycling.

198
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,441
Gossip.

199
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,402
Skydive.

200
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,615
I wonder if Elvis had these problems.

201
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,367
Done.

202
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:34,372
Okay, everyone,
family fun night is ready to begin.

203
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,666
Everyone?

204
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,794
Anyone?

205
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,257
Guys, family fun night.
Everything's ready.

206
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,217
Let's... What's going on?

207
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,262
We're increasing the flow of blood
to our brains to make us think.

208
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,265
- We've only got one day and 23 hours...
- And 16 minutes.

209
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,269
...to come up with the winning idea,
so please leave us alone to think.

210
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,395
Please.

211
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:02,734
You'll figure it out, and if you ask me,
it's a perfect time to take a break.

212
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,068
- Pass.
- Pass.

213
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,114
- I said, if you ask me, it's...
- We kinda didn't ask you.

214
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,325
That's it, you two.

215
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,120
I've been cooking for hours
and finally picked up the house

216
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,332
just so we can have quality fun time
like Mom used to.

217
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,418
You're part of this family,

218
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,422
so you are gonna come downstairs
and have family fun.

219
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,840
Fun, fun, fun!

220
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,595
Is everyone having fun?

221
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,430
Yeah!

222
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,307
- Great.
- Loads of fun!

223
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,852
- I made sci-fi snacks.
- Yummy.

224
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,147
We have deep-fried Martian cockroach.

225
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,817
Delicious.

226
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,279
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- I think someone did.

227
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,199
Nani, what are these?

228
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,494
Alien eyeball dumplings.

229
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,496
What kinda sick joke is this?

230
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,831
Don't be making her mad. Eat it.

231
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,377
It's good.

232
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,180
- Cockroach?
- I'm too upset to eat.

233
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,140
I'm hula-less.

234
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,018
I'm sure you'll come up with something.

235
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,396
Come on. Let's watch the movie.

236
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,650
...are dangerous.
They'll destroy everything in their path.

237
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,069
The authorities are asking all...

238
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,282
- It's a bit redundant, don't ya think?
- I'm trying to watch movie.

239
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,292
It's so beautiful.

240
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,756
Nani, I think you did a great job
with family night.

241
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,301
- I know what your problem is.
- What?

242
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,472
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but your relationship has fizzled.

243
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,766
We've been only going out
for three weeks.

244
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,351
A fizzle is a fizzle.

245
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,689
According to this,
comfort plus time equals boring.

246
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,649
I think she's just tired.

247
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,027
Tired, or tired of you?

248
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,906
I wanted to dance
at your wedding, but...

249
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,325
Fine.

250
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,107
What?

251
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,537
- Stitch!
- Stitch!

252
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,584
Stitch?

253
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,758
No.

254
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,806
Jumba, Jumba, slow down!
Where ya going? Include me!

255
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,849
Something's wrong with 626.

256
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,267
- What is it?
- I don't know.

257
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,602
Or won't tell?

258
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,354
My good eye!

259
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,065
You don't trust me.

260
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,528
Fine. You won't tell me what's going on.
I won't tell you something.

261
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:38,407
What an interesting secret
I have that I won't tell Jumba.

262
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,701
Oh, my, it's a juicy one.

263
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,287
- Quiet, you.
- Okay, I don't have a secret.

264
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,958
But don't shut me out.
Let me in. Let me...

265
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,836
- What's that?
- Is sample of Stitch's fur.

266
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,506
Now we shall see.

267
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,219
No. No.

268
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,888
Those idiot police.

269
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,057
I hoped this day would never come.

270
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,311
What are you talking about?
What is wrong with Stitch?

271
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,484
During his creation,
Stitch was never fully charged.

272
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,407
There is it.

273
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,339
That's not so easy on the throat.

274
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,679
Can it be? Have I done it?

275
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,107
So cute, so fluffy, even.

276
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,195
Where did I go wrong?

277
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,033
What a relief.

278
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:07,288
Your name is 626. Isn't that nice?

279
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,458
I know, I know.

280
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:15,504
You want to get out and wreak havoc,
but your molecules need to be charged.

281
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,216
That's most important part.

282
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,851
Meanwhile, I've got a surprise for you.
Close your eyes.

283
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,271
No peeking. He cheats already.

284
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,111
If it's too big, I have it taken in.

285
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,742
- Open up! Intergalactic Police!
- Is nobody home.

286
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:49,080
Check is in mail. I'm in the tub.

287
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,669
You are under arrest
for illegal genetic experimentation.

288
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,213
You idiots, you will ruin everything.

289
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,383
- No.
- Yeah. Tell it to the council.

290
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,093
You two, get the evidence.

291
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,471
Stop.
His molecules aren't fully charged.

292
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,098
No, no! No!

293
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,141
Warning. Warning.

294
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,602
Electromagnetic bonding incomplete.

295
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,648
No, no,
there's no telling what will happen.

296
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,608
Let me go. No!

297
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:22,071
What will become
of my little monstrosity?

298
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,283
Now his circuits are going haywire.

299
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,785
That's why he was freaking out.

300
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,995
He can't control it.

301
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,708
If it continues, his circuits will
burn themselves out like supernova.

302
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,710
Can ya fix him?

303
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,630
I must,
or my little Stitch will shut down...

304
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,758
For good.

305
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,401
Stitch? Stitch?

306
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:22,631
Once there was a boy with big,
puffy hair who loved meat loaf a lot.

307
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,594
So he put the leftovers
in his pillowcase.

308
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:31,891
But that night, a buzzard flew in the
window and tried to eat the meat loaf.

309
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,852
Trashed the whole house.

310
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,856
And do you know who that boy was?

311
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,274
Elvis.

312
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,276
True story.

313
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,573
I think Stitch feel better.

314
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,034
Even Elvis slipped up sometimes.

315
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,871
But he never stopped trying,
and neither can we.

316
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,208
- Elvis!
- Elvis!

317
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,350
At ease.

318
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,978
When Elvis was in the army,
he got things done.

319
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:23,401
Here's a map that shows
every place Elvis went to in Kauai.

320
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,737
Our mission, go to these places,

321
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,282
where the King
will give us the idea for our hula.

322
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,120
To the hovercraft.

323
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,249
Thanks to a certain sister of mine,
we'll have to walk.

324
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,255
Stop, look and listen, baby

325
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,590
That's my philosophy

326
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,636
It's called rubberneckin', baby

327
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,347
But that's all right with me

328
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,685
Stop, look and listen, baby

329
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,438
That's my philosophy

330
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,442
It's called rubberneckin', baby

331
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,611
But that's all right with me

332
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,115
Some people say I'm wasting time

333
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,368
They don't really know

334
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,621
I like what I see, I see what I like

335
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,459
It gives me such a glow
Yeah, yeah, yeah

336
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:27,006
First thing in the morning
Last thing at night

337
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:33,471
I look, stare everywhere
And I see everything in sight

338
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,975
Stop, look and listen, baby

339
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,645
That's my philosophy

340
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,857
It's called rubberneckin', baby

341
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,402
But that's all right with me

342
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,739
People say I'm wasting time

343
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,992
But I don't really care

344
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,204
I see what I like, I like what I see

345
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,874
It gives me such a glow
Yeah, yeah, yeah

346
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,169
Stop, look and listen, baby

347
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,506
That's my philosophy

348
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,759
It's called rubberneckin', baby

349
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,344
And that's all right with...

350
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:17,348
This is the exact bench
where Elvis sat in Blue Hawaii.

351
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,018
Yeah. That's him.

352
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,896
I can't believe it.

353
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:28,734
My butt is in the shadow
of the butt of Elvis Presley.

354
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,694
Yes.

355
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,446
Okay, Elvis.

356
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:37,117
We're ready to receive
a great idea for our hula.

357
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,841
That's it. I got it.

358
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:57,221
Elvis is trying to tell us
to do a hula about a chicken.

359
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,767
No, he's not.

360
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,689
There's plenty of other places
on the map that we can go to.

361
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,942
We better hurry.

362
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,069
Hey, drop it!

363
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,740
Gotcha.

364
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,581
Yes!

365
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,760
No.

366
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,805
We're sunk.

367
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,118
I know it's hard
to keep the faith sometimes,

368
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:05,289
but if you don't give up on Elvis,
Elvis won't give up on you.

369
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,050
That song.

370
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,385
It's about the Hawaiian goddess Hi'iaka.

371
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,137
Hey! That's right, Lilo.

372
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,764
That's a great story.

373
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,809
Friendship, jealousy,
death by molten lava!

374
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,062
Do you know what this means?

375
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,191
- Thank you, Elvis!
- Thank you, Elvis!

376
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,318
We got our hula.

377
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,706
Stupid supercomputer.

378
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,669
I know, Mom,
but Jumba and I have been very busy.

379
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,171
- My mom says hi.
- Yeah, hi...

380
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:58,050
He's waving.
I can't talk about it, Mom. It's top secret.

381
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,719
- I said I was sorry.
- That's it. That's it!

382
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,055
I have to go, Mom. Talk to you Sunday.

383
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,850
I finished plans for new fusion chamber
that will recharge Stitch.

384
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,976
Way to go.

385
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,854
But we don't have alien technology
to build it.

386
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,231
Way to burst a bubble.

387
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:17,361
We'll have to find primitive Earth
machinery and just hope it works.

388
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,864
No prob. I can get
all those parts from the house.

389
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,371
Stitch is having another episode.
They're getting worse.

390
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,958
Hurry. These parts
are crucial to saving Stitch's life.

391
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,001
Nothing can go wrong.

392
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,388
Target sighted.

393
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,849
Gotcha.

394
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,560
No, it's you. I mean, hi, Nani.

395
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,063
- What are you doing with the toaster?
- This?

396
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,399
Yeah, interesting question.

397
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,235
- What's going on?
- I was just about to...

398
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,362
We have to hurry to... Nani...

399
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,406
- To make toast.
- Toast?

400
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,408
Making toast. We're making toast.

401
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:08,078
Toast. Who doesn't enjoy
nice, crispy piece of toast?

402
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,538
Answer, nobody.

403
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,917
And there's so many different kinds.
Rye, sourdough, pumpernickel.

404
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,588
You can put marmalade on it.
Tasty toast.

405
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,381
You don't know what you're missing.

406
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,551
- Care to try some?
- That's okay. I've gotta go to work.

407
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,887
And, boys?

408
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,597
Don't play with the toaster.

409
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,101
Hi, David. Gotta run.

410
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,771
If you're hungry, we've got toast.
Lots of toast.

411
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,607
- Should I make more?
- Just get rid of him.

412
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,359
- But how?
- You're the Earth expert.

413
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,117
David, David, David.

414
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,245
Poor, sweet David.

415
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,456
Trusting, naive David.

416
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:56,585
- Okay, maybe I do need help.
- You're in good hands.

417
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,130
For 29.95,
you can have the kayak all day long.

418
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,590
But, of course...

419
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,217
Look at her.

420
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,680
- Doesn't even know you're here.
- Maybe because we're hiding.

421
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,684
I'm sorry. Is my relationship dying? No.

422
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,145
Okay, okay.
What you think I should do?

423
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,981
Well, it's obvious
she's taking you for granted.

424
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:22,444
But she won't if
she sees another woman interested.

425
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,695
What other woman?

426
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,699
- Yeah!
- Have fun.

427
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:32,162
Oh, my, you're so fascinating and tan.

428
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,165
I'm so clumsy.

429
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,543
You've gotta be kidding me.

430
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,296
- I don't think...
- It's working. She's coming over.

431
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,841
- Hey, Nani.
- No waving. Be cool.

432
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,219
Is that a deltoid or a rhomboid?

433
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,347
Okay.

434
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,933
Hey, David, I'm off at 5:00.
Wanna get some dinner?

435
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,601
- Great.
- He has plans.

436
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,896
- He does?
- With me. I'm the new girl on the island.

437
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,565
Let me get this straight.

438
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,359
You came here and interrupted me

439
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,113
to tell me you have
pretend plans with Pleakley?

440
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,032
I don't know what you're talking about.

441
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,786
My name is Inga.
I'm a foreign exchange student.

442
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,454
Are you jealous?

443
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,957
No.

444
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,669
Well, you blew it.

445
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,608
This is how the story goes, Stitch.

446
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,779
Once, there was a beautiful
goddess named Hi'iaka

447
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,657
and a handsome mortal
named Lohi'au.

448
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,412
They were as close
as two people could be.

449
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,253
But one day, Pele,
the volcano goddess,

450
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,631
grew jealous of their friendship.

451
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:14,848
So she took Lohi'au and threw him
into a volcano filled with molten lava.

452
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,601
Stitch!

453
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,269
My bad.

454
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:29,613
Hi'iaka discovered his body
in a cavern by a sea cliff,

455
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,448
and she stayed with him,

456
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,202
praying to the gods
to bring Lohi'au's spirit back.

457
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,498
And it worked.

458
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,750
Her love brought him back to life,

459
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:46,463
proving that love
is more powerful than death.

460
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:51,510
I will love you always

461
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,558
We are ready for rehearsal.

462
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:07,401
Okay, girls, this is your last rehearsal
before tomorrow's competition.

463
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,612
What if I forget the moves
and Mertle laughs at me?

464
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,699
And I get mad and pound her?

465
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,660
You gotta help me, Stitch. I need you.

466
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,578
We do together.

467
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,294
Our hula is about an ancient friendship

468
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,048
that proves love
is more powerful than death.

469
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,842
Oh, brother.

470
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,512
The great goddess Hi'iaka... That's me!

471
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,890
And the brave and handsome
mortal Lohi'au.

472
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,394
That's Stitch.

473
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:52,821
I said, the handsome mortal Lohi'au!

474
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,993
Handsome mortal!

475
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,704
Stink-o-rama.

476
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,831
Stitch, get out here.

477
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,127
What are you doing?

478
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,797
Cut it out.

479
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,550
That's not what we practiced.

480
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,677
Stitch!

481
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,264
No!

482
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,268
- Stop it!
- He's crazy!

483
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,607
Girls, girls, get behind me.

484
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,902
Lilo, get control of your dog.
Nice doggy...

485
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,820
Lilo! Lilo!

486
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:46,917
Lilo, you will not be allowed
to rehearse at this halau again.

487
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,299
Lilo, I... I...

488
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,641
Come on.
It couldn't have been that bad.

489
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,727
It was.

490
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,604
Mahalo. Have a good one.

491
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,691
- You're not listening to me.
- I'm listening. I have to work.

492
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:17,614
My hula career is falling to pieces,
and you're worried about stinking work?

493
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,075
Stitch needs you to be patient with him.

494
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,120
- He did it on purpose.
- You don't mean that.

495
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,455
You should have seen
the way he was acting.

496
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:30,877
- Aren't you being overdramatic?
- His goodness level is at rock bottom.

497
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,932
I love you so

498
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,643
I can't let you go

499
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,521
Don't tell me no

500
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,857
I need your love tonight

501
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,568
Gee, the way you kiss

502
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,237
Sweedee, too good to miss

503
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,157
I want more of this

504
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,951
I need your love tonight

505
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,328
I've been waiting just for tonight

506
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,123
To do some lovin' and hold you tight

507
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,500
Don't tell me, baby, you gotta go

508
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,503
I got the hi-fi high
and the lights down low

509
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,006
Hey, now, hear what I say

510
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,842
You better stay

511
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,511
Don't run away

512
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:45,243
I need your love tonight

513
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,038
I love you so

514
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,790
I can't let you go

515
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,543
Don't tell me no

516
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,046
I need your love tonight

517
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,590
Gee, the way you kiss

518
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,301
Sweedee, too good to miss

519
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,179
I want more of this

520
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:11,811
I need your love tonight

521
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,899
Yeah.

522
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,947
The great goddess Hi'iaka... That's me.

523
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,117
And the brave mortal Lohi'au...

524
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,828
That's also me.

525
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,709
Were best friends.

526
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,295
Lilo, look.

527
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,216
- Their friendship proved...
- I'm good now. No more badness.

528
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,926
Sorry.

529
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,306
- The great goddess Hi'iaka...
- Stitch good.

530
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,475
Stitch, just get outta here.

531
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,935
Fuzzball.

532
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,772
- No, you out.
- No, you.

533
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,650
- You. You!
- You. You!

534
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,818
Fine.

535
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,861
I will.

536
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,073
- No, Stitch will.
- I'm leaving first.

537
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,285
- I'm leaving first! I am.
- No! Stitch first!

538
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,621
Who took my hair...
Who took my hair dryer?

539
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,624
Get back here. You'll be sorry.

540
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,211
- Open this door, trog.
- Who's there?

541
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,714
- Stitch. Open the door.
- Okay.

542
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,216
What is up with you two?

543
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,136
- Nani, it's me.
- Neither of you move.

544
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,639
David, I'm glad you're here...

545
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,057
David?

546
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,102
Nani, you're not the only fish in the sea.

547
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,148
- Tell her you have...
- Because I have a lot of...

548
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:42,319
- Tell her your options.
- Options?

549
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,155
Options. Really?

550
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,249
Are you jealous?

551
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,379
- She's touching me.
- I'm not touching you.

552
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,049
- You're touching me!
- Not touching.

553
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,801
- Touching me!
- It's free air.

554
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,471
Would you cut it out?

555
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,765
This is crazy. You guys are family.

556
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,272
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he ruins everything.

557
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,442
- Not my fault.
- Then whose fault is it?

558
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,611
You're dead meat.

559
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,447
That is it!

560
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,867
Go to your room
and make up like loving friends!

561
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,535
- You're gross.
- Stupid head.

562
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,371
Keep walking.

563
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,881
Stitch sorry.

564
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,843
We said we were gonna be good.
I needed you, Stitch.

565
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,560
Stitch good again.

566
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:06,403
If you promise to be good,
I'll give you one more chance.

567
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,906
- But I want you to promise.
- Yeah.

568
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,663
You get the costumes,
and I'll get the record player.

569
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,752
Stitch good.
Good, good, good, good, good.

570
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,712
Stitch good...

571
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,140
We are ready.

572
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,228
- Stitch.
- Lilo.

573
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,022
- Everything's ruined.
- I... I sorry.

574
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,608
I don't know why I ever believed you.

575
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,069
Something wrong with Stitch.

576
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,280
I know what's wrong with you.

577
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,867
You're bad, and you'll always be bad.

578
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,002
Three. Two. One.

579
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,963
There it is, Pleakley.

580
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,925
The fusion chamber,
the only thing that can save Stitch.

581
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:14,137
- It's amazing.
- Just another work of genius.

582
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,223
Can I switch it on? Please, please?

583
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,476
No, no, no. No, no, no.

584
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,353
That is extremely delicate machine.

585
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,647
It takes superior mind.

586
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,824
Thanks to me, crisis is over.

587
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,830
Jumba? Jumba?

588
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,248
What happened?

589
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,844
That's it, Pleakley.

590
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,930
It's over.

591
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,432
I can't build a new fusion chamber.

592
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,185
Sure you can,
like you built the first one.

593
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,521
I didn't build first one.

594
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,732
I ordered it from catalogue.

595
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,150
A catalogue?

596
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:13,321
And now there is no hope
for my little creation.

597
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,039
Jumba has failed family.

598
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,543
So you didn't build
the first fusion chamber.

599
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,877
So what?

600
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,714
You still built Stitch, didn't ya?
Well, didn't ya?

601
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,341
Yes.

602
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,386
And you're still an evil genius. Admit it.

603
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,556
No, I... I don't like to brag.

604
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:43,851
Well, see, that's why
you're the only one who can do it.

605
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,902
Pleakley, my wrench!

606
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,866
Lilo?

607
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,414
Hey, Lilo.

608
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,959
I'm not doing the hula with him.
So don't try to make me.

609
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,586
Okay, okay.

610
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,088
He's ruining my chance of winning.

611
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,341
Lilo, baby, it's just a contest.

612
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,387
- No, it's not. Now get off my bed.
- Not until we talk about this.

613
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,432
You're no help! I wish Mom were here.

614
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:26,144
- I'm doing the best I can.
- Well, it's not good enough.

615
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,187
Don't you think I know that?

616
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:52,211
Hey. Remember how she would always
make up those funny constellations?

617
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,464
Like Swiss Cheese Man?

618
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,216
Where is the Stinky Bag of Garbage
again?

619
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,053
Near the Sour Milky Way.

620
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:04,307
Right, near the Old Lady
with the Chihuahua on her Head.

621
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:14,442
I have to win the contest,
just like Mom did.

622
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:19,656
If I win, she'll know I'm good,
and she'll be proud of me.

623
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,117
Baby.

624
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,497
You don't have to win anything
for Mom to be proud of you.

625
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,542
- How do you know?
- Because I know everything.

626
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,046
Okay, I don't know everything,

627
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,676
but I think Mom would be proud of you
just for being you.

628
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,595
You, too.

629
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,683
Thanks, Lilo.

630
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,576
Stitch good.

631
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,167
Stitch good now.

632
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:22,904
A little less conversation
a little more action, please

633
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,491
All this aggravation
ain't satisfactioning me

634
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:31,204
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark

635
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,791
Close your mouth and open up
your heart and, baby, satisfy me

636
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,375
Satisfy me, baby

637
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,968
Do you think Lilo will show up?

638
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,972
After that rehearsal? She wouldn't dare.

639
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:15,164
- Come on, come on
- Come on, come on

640
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,124
Don't procrastinate, don't articulate

641
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,878
Girl, it's getting late
gettin' upset waitin' around

642
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:25,174
A little less conversation
a little more action, please

643
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:29,262
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark

644
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,181
Close your mouth and open up
your heart and, baby, satisfy me

645
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:37,103
- Satisfy me
- Satisfy me

646
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:47,238
I just wanted to say
I am very proud of all your hard work.

647
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,700
If it were up to me,
you would all win first place.

648
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,538
He's just saying that
so the losers don't feel bad.

649
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,707
Hi, Nani.

650
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,043
Yeah.

651
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,379
Okay.

652
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,594
Welcome to
our annual May Day Festival,

653
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:13,347
where one of our little girls
will be chosen alaka'i.

654
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:17,560
First up is Aleka,
doing the dance of the pineapple.

655
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,361
That should do it.

656
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,578
What if it doesn't work?

657
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,622
It will.

658
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,801
Maika'i, Aleka.

659
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,804
Next up is Mertle Edmonds.

660
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,602
It's a gift certificate to my daddy's store.

661
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,395
Hit it.

662
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,485
Legend tells of a man named Karl

663
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:11,113
who dreamt of offering
authentic Hawaiian collectibles

664
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,449
at an affordable price.

665
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:17,787
Like this costume
in seven natural colors,

666
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:23,292
and these genuine faux pearls,
each a jewel of the Pacific.

667
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:29,840
The best things in life are marked down
for clearance this weekend at Karl's.

668
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,387
Mertle, what can I say?

669
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,847
Thank you.

670
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,475
It's in the bag.

671
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,188
If Jumba and Pleakley don't get here
soon, they're gonna miss Lilo.

672
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,653
No.

673
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,990
- What's happening?
- His circuits are about to blow.

674
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,492
We have to get him
in the fusion chamber now!

675
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,704
- Shouldn't we test it?
- There isn't time.

676
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:07,003
Next we have Lilo, who's doing her hula
about an ancient friendship.

677
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,379
This is it.

678
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,174
- You'll be great.
- Stitch?

679
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,594
I just want to say I...

680
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,680
I can't talk now. I have to go on.

681
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,889
I know, I...

682
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,601
- No, badness coming on.
- What?

683
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,479
- I... I have to...
- Are you okay?

684
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,107
Stitch!

685
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,452
No.

686
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:43,205
- Stitch?
- No, Lilo. Too dangerous.

687
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:49,045
- Stitch?
- Lilo, it's your turn. Everybody's waiting.

688
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,892
My hula is about an ancient friendship

689
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:08,189
that proves love
is more powerful than death.

690
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,214
I will love you, I will love you

691
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,180
I'm sorry, Mom.

692
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,938
Stitch! Come back!

693
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,358
- Have you seen Stitch?
- We thought he was with you.

694
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,821
- Lilo, baby, what happened?
- Something's wrong with Stitch.

695
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,906
He's malfunctioning.

696
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,117
And if we don't find him soon...

697
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,707
Stitch!

698
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,501
Stitch?

699
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,420
- Stitch! Where are you?
- Stitch.

700
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,964
You there, brudda, brudda?

701
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,466
Stitch!

702
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,478
No!

703
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,606
Hey, we'll find him.

704
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:38,445
- We looked everywhere.
- He only has few minutes left.

705
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,783
- The ship.
- The fusion chamber.

706
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,493
Stitch!

707
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,344
Stitch.

708
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,060
We have to stop him.

709
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,903
- I think I should drive.
- Two eyes. My car. I'm driving.

710
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:24,742
At the rate he is going, he's soon
to be accelerating into stratosphere.

711
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,703
If only we had way to
communicate with him.

712
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:32,374
Stitch has taken off in the ship,
and we have no way to contact him.

713
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,252
- Poor Jumba. He's worked so hard.
- Give me that!

714
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,381
Yes, yes... Yes, Mother Pleakley.
He'll call you back.

715
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:42,843
Hello. Thanks for using
the Uninhabited Planet Index,

716
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:46,597
your guide to the galaxy's
most isolated and lonely locations.

717
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:50,935
If your selection is Planet Z-13,
engage hyper-drive.

718
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,896
Stitch! Can you hear me? I need you.

719
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,898
Please come back.

720
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,735
Stitch can never come back.

721
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:09,245
- He's lost control of ship.
- What?

722
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,172
What do we do now?

723
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,928
It was my best hiding place.

724
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:36,063
Get him into fusion chamber
before his energy runs out.

725
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,690
Is only chance!

726
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,663
No.

727
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,458
Stitch?

728
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,136
Stitch!

729
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,475
No, Lilo. Too dangerous.

730
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,602
You're not dangerous.

731
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,232
We have to get you
into Jumba's machine.

732
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:36,874
No worry. I've got you, Nani.

733
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,150
Stitch, you're gonna be okay now.

734
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,695
Please be okay.

735
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,661
Stitch sorry.

736
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,212
Stitch?

737
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,050
Hurry, before...

738
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,843
No!

739
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:33,055
Jumba. Jumba, it's not working.

740
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,765
No.

741
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,065
We're too late.

742
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:09,258
- No!
- Lilo, wait. There's nothing you can do.

743
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,678
He's gone.

744
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,888
Honey, come here.

745
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,306
No!

746
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,561
Stitch.

747
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,730
I'm so sorry.

748
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,946
I kept saying how I needed you.

749
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,993
But you needed me more.

750
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,094
You're my ohana, Stitch.

751
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,267
And I'll always love you.

752
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:44,937
I will love you

753
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,817
Stitch not bad.

754
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,861
Stitch fluffy.

755
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,029
Stitch!

756
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,788
But how is it possible?

757
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,164
It's not.

758
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,336
Stitch okay now?

759
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,381
No more nightmares.

760
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,551
Stitch!

761
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:18,262
You look fluffier than ever.

762
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,514
Come here, you. Group hug!

763
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:34,861
So Hi'iaka and Lohi'au were reunited
and are together to this day.

764
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,274
Nani!

765
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,278
I will love you

766
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,615
I will love you always

767
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,784
When it's hard to stand

768
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,829
You can take my hand

769
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,415
And I will love you

770
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:32,586
I will love you always

771
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,463
I will love you

772
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:38,175
I will love you always

773
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,094
Mom would be so proud of you.

774
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,475
I will love you

775
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:51,104
I will love you always
