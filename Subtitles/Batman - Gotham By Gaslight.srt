2
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,365
A woman? Of course.

3
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:53,784
But is she human?

4
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:56,955
Well, that's another story.

5
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:00,257
The Gotham Gaiety Girls presents...

6
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:02,956
...Ivy, the Plant Lady.

7
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:11,201
But be warned, fellas.

8
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,538
This ivy is poison.

9
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:16,701
Dare you taste her forbidden fruit?

10
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:41,625
Disarm them all already.
Let's see those leaves fall.

11
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:40,199
You gave me a start.

12
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:42,492
I thought for a minute...

13
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,395
Well, you're clearly a real gentleman.

14
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:49,533
You lonely? I hate to see a man lonely.

15
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:52,070
I got a generous nature.

16
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,505
And I'm sure you're generous too.

17
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:56,336
Ain't ya, mister?

18
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:02,076
My room's not far.

19
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:06,914
Or maybe you don't want to wait.

20
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:18,397
No. No! No!

21
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,733
You took the shortcut
through outsider's territory.

22
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,183
You gotta pay the tariff.
Ain't that right, Dickie?

23
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:30,140
Name's Jason. 'Member?
We don't say our names.

24
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,379
Oh, let's go back to the flop, fellas.
It's getting awful late.

25
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,082
Don't go yellow on me, boy...

26
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:39,450
...or you know what you'll get.

27
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,416
Don't you worry, Bill. We're on the job.

28
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,556
What are you scared of the dark, Little Tim?

29
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:48,593
Nah, it's just... after what
happened to Johnny Gobbs, I...

30
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:51,449
That ain't real, Timmy.
He's like Santa Claus.

31
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:55,700
Just a story they tell to keep young turfs
like us from making an honest living.

32
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,070
Oh, he's real, all right.
That's why you gotta pay us.

33
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,129
For protecting you from monsters.

34
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,068
Now pay up.

35
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:08,632
I think we might have broke 'em, boys.

36
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,480
Bat!

37
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,318
Holy shit!

38
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:20,052
Stick 'im, boys.

39
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,415
You're the galumph who's been
making a nuisance of yourself...

40
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,508
...all over Gotham, ain't ya?

41
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:51,655
Well, now you're
in Big Bill Dust's territory...

42
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:55,026
...interfering with my amiable Cock Robins.

43
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:57,062
You're bad for business.

44
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:59,573
Bad all 'round.

45
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:04,064
Too bad for you.

46
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:30,394
- Go home.
- Am home.

47
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:32,429
Home to mommy.

48
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,931
He ain't got one. None of us do.

49
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:37,535
Or we run off from something
even worse than this.

50
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:40,605
This is our family now.
Making something here.

51
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:44,672
- Taking something back from Gotham.
- Make something else.

52
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:47,812
- Something better.
- We got no choice.

53
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:50,724
He'll just chase us down, find us again.

54
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:58,272
He won't be chasing anyone for a long time.

55
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:01,888
Go to St. Caduales, ask for Sister Leslie.

56
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,788
She'll help you.

57
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,227
Get off the street, now!

58
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:03,020
Blood, sweat and tears.

59
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,194
That's what turned this dream
into a magnificent reality, gentlemen.

60
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:09,720
That and Bruce Wayne's money.

61
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:16,867
Spoken like a true,
county prosecutor, Mr. Dent.

62
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:18,637
Money always helps.

63
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:22,406
But it is the ingenuity
of the city's captains of industry...

64
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:24,212
...that provided these marvels.

65
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:28,309
And may you select few truly
enjoy this special preview...

66
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,010
...of the Gotham World's Fair.

67
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:15,055
The stairway to heaven.

68
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:18,529
A fully electronical lantern,
bright enough to illuminate...

69
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:20,898
...the very celestial firmament above.

70
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:25,486
Higher even than the police department's
new lighter-than-air patrol craft.

71
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:26,772
Let's see it.

72
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:30,891
The light tends to show off a bit better
in the night time, Ambrose.

73
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:34,478
But here's a sight you needn't
wait to marvel at.

74
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,465
Gotham's own answer to the Eiffel Tower.

75
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:41,819
The fox wheel will elevate you
two hundred and fifty feet into the sky...

76
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,376
...at the astonishing rate
of 15 miles an hour.

77
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:50,201
Heavens! Can the human body
even survive that kind of motion?

78
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:54,885
Most certainly, ma'am. I refer you to medical
expert and Gotham's premier alienist...

79
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:56,816
...Dr. Hugo Strange.

80
00:08:56,896 --> 00:09:01,171
The human organs can withstand
velocities up to 35 miles per hour.

81
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:05,875
Ride the wheel, and I give you my
guarantee as a physician and surgeon...

82
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:08,959
- ...you will live.
- It's a shame you won't provide...

83
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,683
...this same assurance
to the ladies of Gotham, Mr. Mayor.

84
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:15,770
Women are being gutted
in the streets like wild game...

85
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,484
...and the Gotham police
stand twiddling their thumbs.

86
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:23,744
I'm sure Ms. Kyle's lovely voice is better
suited to the stage of the Monarch Theater...

87
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:26,504
- ...than a city council meeting.
- Mr. Dent...

88
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:30,117
Sure, and no ladies
have been killed, Ms. Kyle.

89
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:33,339
Some gin-soaked women of the street
have met their fate.

90
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:37,042
- As is common to their kind.
- Belay that, Chief.

91
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:42,378
Ms. Kyle, I assure you visitors
to this fair, men and women alike...

92
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,468
- ...will be safe from...
- Jack. Jack the Ripper.

93
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:50,277
That's what he calls himself in the letter
he sent the Gotham Gazette, isn't it?

94
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:54,027
Now, Sister Leslie,
that letter's likely just another hoax.

95
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:58,478
Really, Bulldog? Strange it would arrive
with a human kidney in the envelope.

96
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,798
There's a butcher in this town
preying on poor women.

97
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:05,039
And if you don't stop him,
so help me, I'll raise holy hell.

98
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:08,454
Sister, your selfless dedication
to Gotham's poor is...

99
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:09,974
Poor is the word.

100
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:13,547
If these murdered ladies were from
Crest Hill instead of Skinner's End...

101
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,712
...you'd have the killer by now.

102
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:19,540
My men are working triple shifts combing
every inch of this city for this mad man.

103
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,800
You know I've pledged to clean up
Gotham and I mean all of it.

104
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,554
It's that bat creature we've been
reading about. That's who it is.

105
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:28,809
That could very well be.

106
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,564
He's a devil, that one.
My men just can't seem to...

107
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:35,298
To do anything, Chief Bullock,
but sit on their fat arses and...

108
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:37,083
Just a damn minute.

109
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:40,964
Your charity house is what draws
these pests in in the first...

110
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:48,979
Well, as I live and breathe.
If it isn't himself.

111
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:53,516
Welcome! A hearty welcome
to Gotham's favorite native son.

112
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,753
Bruce Wayne.

113
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,122
Thank you, thank you, Mayor Tolliver.

114
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:02,819
Please don't stop on my account.
You know I like to keep a low profile.

115
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:06,129
I heard about this
little city council meeting...

116
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:09,582
...and thought it was a good opportunity
to see how my money was being spent...

117
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:12,598
...and all I see is sour faces.

118
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:16,807
Think nothing of that, my boy.

119
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:19,876
They're just a few disruptive
females in attendance.

120
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:23,214
Don't worry, sir. I was just about
to have them escorted away.

121
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:24,995
Leslie!

122
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:30,167
You were saying, Chief?

123
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:35,580
There were newspapers in Europe, James.
Is it as bad as I read?

124
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,995
Worse. Despite your best efforts
with this World's Fair.

125
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:42,166
...the city seems to be getting
more deplorable every day.

126
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:47,271
First, this masked Batman vigilante,
then this Jack the Ripper lunatic.

127
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,939
- They're not the same man?
- Rubbish.

128
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:54,677
The parish home is full of unfortunates who
swear the Batman saved them from the gangs.

129
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:58,548
- He's on the side of the angels.
- This Ripper, however, is not.

130
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:02,418
I've seen the bodies, Bruce.
Cut to pieces, like an autopsy.

131
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:04,984
Just absolutely appalling.

132
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:09,375
Strange the top man at Arkham
tells us he's never seen...

133
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:11,675
...this kind of controlled savagery before.

134
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,303
Bruce, the latest victim
was one of our orphanage girls.

135
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:22,045
It was Pamela.

136
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,290
What? No.

137
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,381
You wrote me. You said she was working.

138
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,730
Dancing, then the opium.

139
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,912
And now...

140
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:36,044
- We can't save them all.
- I'm sorry, Bruce.

141
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:38,639
I know those orphans are close to your heart.

142
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:41,888
If I didn't have Sister Leslie
when my parents...

143
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:45,947
...funding the orphanage
is the least I could do.

144
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:49,149
And now you're back in the manor.

145
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:52,740
Too remote. I've a town house on Bell Avenue.

146
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,406
I look forward to showing it to you.
Unfortunately, tonight I have to...

147
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:59,592
Don't say another word.
I'll not hear you lie.

148
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:02,663
And a rich bachelor is always up to no good.

149
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:06,167
I'm afraid it's unavoidable.
Isn't that right, Alfred?

150
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:09,202
Your evening attire
has already been laid out, sir.

151
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:11,422
Well, duty calls, I'm afraid.

152
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:15,275
Do you suppose his pressing business
is blonde, brunette, or a redhead?

153
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:18,707
James Gordon,
you've got a dirty mind, you do.

154
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:21,694
My money's on blonde.

155
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:30,642
- I hope you're unharmed, miss.
- Damn you.

156
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,846
You're a fool. I'll never have a better
chance of stopping that butcher...

157
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,942
...and you squandered it,
playing the knight in shining armor.

158
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:45,511
I can take care of myself.

159
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:49,198
Don't be so sure. He's more skilled
than I would have thought.

160
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,817
I don't need or want your help.

161
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:53,986
And before you gallantly offer
to escort me home...

162
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:56,919
...let me assure you,
I am quite capable of...

163
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:02,775
Well, thank you for that at least.

164
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,705
Barbara!

165
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,627
Barbara.

166
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:26,466
Hush! The children don't have
to be up for hours.

167
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,826
What is it, James? What's wrong?

168
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,250
Dream. Just a dream.

169
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,795
And then, you were gone.

170
00:18:42,716 --> 00:18:44,534
I'm all right, dear.

171
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,244
James, these hours, you're working too hard.

172
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,212
And that's not likely to change.

173
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:57,297
I can't very well sit at home
while Gotham goes straight to hell.

174
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:00,884
No, you couldn't, could you?

175
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,486
I'll make your eggs.

176
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,962
- Damnation!
- Don't be alarmed.

177
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:21,607
So says the man dressed up like a bat.

178
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:25,978
I'm on your side, Commissioner.
I mean to rid Gotham of the Ripper.

179
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:29,616
Really? And who'll help me rid Gotham of you?

180
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:32,269
Your men don't search too hard for me.

181
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:34,769
I'm betting that comes from the top down.

182
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:38,868
Back in the union camp at Culpepper,
soldiers would sometimes ignore...

183
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:42,624
...a feral cat just to keep
the rat population in check.

184
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:45,165
Other times, we'd eat them.

185
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:47,570
I know a vigilante from a maniac.

186
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,704
This Ripper is far worse
than the lunatic you're searching for.

187
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:55,249
He's a skilled hunter,
and he's just getting started.

188
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:58,678
You ought to have breakfast
with Hugo Strange up at Arkham Asylum.

189
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:02,752
You can compare useless theories.
I prefer facts.

190
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:05,268
I ran into your Ripper earlier this evening.

191
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:09,356
Approximately 6'3", 250 pounds, left handed.

192
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:13,292
Good fighter. Trained, not just a brawler.

193
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:17,964
- You didn't happen to see his face, did you?
- I need your files on the Ripper.

194
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:20,065
Detailed descriptions of the crime scene...

195
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:23,106
...photo plates,
even profiles from your alienist.

196
00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:26,856
Would you prefer them alphabetized
or in chronological order?

197
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,947
- James?
- Stay inside, Barbara.

198
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,857
I'll be in directly.

199
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:36,011
Every woman in Gotham
is in danger, Commissioner.

200
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:40,070
A letter from Jack to the Gotham Gazette.

201
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,671
We've convinced them
to refrain from publishing it.

202
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:45,298
Makes poor bedtime reading, I assure you.

203
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,861
Perhaps you'll find
something of use in there.

204
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:49,228
Thank you.

205
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:52,682
I'll leave a copy of the Ripper file
on the roof of the police station.

206
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:55,054
I know you fancy rooftops.

207
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:59,405
But understand that this uninvited visit
to my home will not be repeated.

208
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:01,675
This house is my refuge...

209
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:04,503
...set apart from all
the corruption of Got...

210
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:10,567
James, your eggs are ready.
Are you sure you won't come inside?

211
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:13,066
Yes, yes. I'm coming.

212
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:23,095
"Dear Boss, Gotham has become
a den of filth and scum.

213
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:28,034
I'm down on whores and I shan't quit
ripping them till I do get buckled.

214
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:33,105
Grand work, the last job was.
I hardly gave the lady no time to squeal.

215
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:34,775
How can they catch me now?

216
00:21:34,855 --> 00:21:39,178
I love my work, cutting whores and then
degenerates what with defend them."

217
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:41,180
A little light reading, Master Bruce?

218
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,401
"Them cusses' of coppers
nor the false God you hide behind...

219
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:48,188
...won't spoil the game for me.
I will be on a job soon...

220
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:51,134
...and will send you another bit of innards."

221
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:55,952
Goes on like that in some detail
about his dissection plans.

222
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:58,198
Mrs. Cooper has sent up a portage.

223
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:02,623
<i>Bon appetit.</i> And what do you deduce
from this <i>magnum opus?</i>

224
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,337
Very little.

225
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,473
Cheap paper with no watermark.

226
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:11,411
The hand is that of a man with some education
disguised to look like a man with none.

227
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:14,542
I'm certain your displays
of graphology would duly impress...

228
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:17,351
...any young ladies you encounter.

229
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:20,313
Women are a distraction
from the mission, Alfred.

230
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,936
So you've said. Your evening attire, sir.

231
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:29,413
I believe you know that was not
the suit I was referring to...

232
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:31,854
...when I said I'd be
going out tonight, Alfred.

233
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,484
I've taken the liberty
of placing your other suit...

234
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:36,769
...in the seat compartment
of the carriage, sir.

235
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:41,475
Before the Batman can prowl, I'm afraid,
Bruce Wayne must needs make an appearance.

236
00:22:41,555 --> 00:22:43,206
Tongues will wag.

237
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:46,030
What engagement have I accepted?

238
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,041
You are carousing with the lively
man-about-town and rake...

239
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:52,869
...your oldest school chum,
Master Harvey Dent.

240
00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:54,798
Gotham's solicitor.

241
00:22:55,885 --> 00:23:00,590
I'm certain you shall have a pleasant
and elegant evening's entertainment, sir.

242
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,408
<i>When the circus came to town
Jay Augustus Henpecked Brown</i>

243
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:18,735
<i>Bought himself a ticket for the show</i>

244
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:22,982
<i>Passed by all the acrobats
All the clowns in funny hats</i>

245
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:27,287
<i>Went to see the animals below</i>

246
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:31,725
<i>Saw a tamer put his head into a lion's mouth</i>

247
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:35,676
<i>Waited till the tamer man was through</i>

248
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:40,149
<i>Shook his hand and said,
"at taming wild ones, you're a bird</i>

249
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:43,953
<i>"But just one thing I'd like to ask of you"</i>

250
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:48,291
<i>Can you tame Wild Wimmen?</i>

251
00:23:48,371 --> 00:23:52,945
<i>Can you tame Wild Wimmen?</i>

252
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:57,283
<i>You made a tiger stand
And eat out of your hand</i>

253
00:23:57,363 --> 00:24:01,027
<i>You made the hippo do the flippo
Honest, it was grand</i>

254
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:05,591
<i>Can you tame Wild Wimmen?</i>

255
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:08,979
<i>So they'll always lead
A sweet and simple life</i>

256
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,113
Bruce, I'm in love.

257
00:24:11,193 --> 00:24:14,470
Well, that's great news, Harvey.
I'm sure your wife will be glad to hear it.

258
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,486
Oh, please, Bruce. This is the 19th century.

259
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:19,838
Don't be such a dinosaur.

260
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,142
Marriage is more like a business arrangement.

261
00:24:22,222 --> 00:24:26,074
Besides, what Gilda doesn't know,
won't hurt her.

262
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:34,199
Selina is the most amazing gal,
Bruce. You'll see.

263
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:36,819
I think I already do.

264
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,405
Just make yourselves at home,
gentlemen. I'll make myself decent.

265
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,847
I certainly hope not.

266
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:52,771
Did you enjoy my performance, Mr. Wayne?

267
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:57,131
Bruce. And I'm told you also gave
quite an impassioned performance...

268
00:24:57,211 --> 00:24:58,919
...at the World's Fair preview.

269
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,964
I'm passionate in everything I do, Bruce.

270
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:04,763
And boss Tolliver needed to get the message.

271
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:15,917
Come on, my pet.
Let's see if we can't make our way...

272
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:20,482
...to a more comfortable establishment
before Gordon's killjoy curfew takes effect.

273
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,635
Listen carefully, kitten...

274
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:27,235
...I'm many things but I'm nobody's pet.

275
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:39,051
And you can't doubt for one minute
that if men were being slaughtered...

276
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:42,789
...Tolliver would hire an army
of policemen to find this Ripper.

277
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:44,311
But I don't agree.

278
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:48,794
If it were affluent women, society ladies,
the outcry might be deafening.

279
00:25:48,874 --> 00:25:51,998
Jack targets destitute women.

280
00:25:52,078 --> 00:25:54,750
When the voiceless cry out, no one hears.

281
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,688
I think you're ignoring
the real tragedy here.

282
00:25:59,118 --> 00:26:02,471
Every establishment in town is closing down.

283
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:08,313
What a shame. I was starting to suspect
that there was more to your friend...

284
00:26:08,393 --> 00:26:11,434
...than a good family name
and prep school manners.

285
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:13,803
Well, there's the Wayne fortune.

286
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:16,772
But I'm sure you didn't forget that,
did you, Selina?

287
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,887
Steady, old man.

288
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:21,961
You'll have to excuse Harvey.

289
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:26,765
Oh, I know. When he drinks,
he's an entirely different person.

290
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:29,080
A regular Jekyll and Hyde.

291
00:26:34,484 --> 00:26:37,611
This is my club. We can catch a hansom here.

292
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:42,014
I'd invite you in for a drink but,
unfortunately, men only.

293
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:44,946
At least we still have something.

294
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,719
I didn't take you for an anti-suffragist.

295
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:01,668
I don't think the doorman
was quite convinced that I'm a man.

296
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:04,753
If he was, I'd have to have him dismissed.

297
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:09,638
The Dionysus Club cannot tolerate
a doorman who is blind.

298
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:12,878
You'd never do that. Have someone fired.

299
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,625
You're too kind. I've heard.

300
00:27:16,162 --> 00:27:17,384
You don't know me.

301
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:20,819
I know most other men would've
abandoned Harvey hours ago.

302
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:23,857
- Well, we've all had a few.
- You haven't.

303
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:27,377
You've been pouring your drinks
in potted plants all night.

304
00:27:27,957 --> 00:27:33,065
A mutual friend told me you like to solve
mysteries, ever since you were a boy.

305
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:35,230
You're studying me.

306
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:38,271
You're a fascinating subject.

307
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:40,640
And what have you learned?

308
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,642
Only that you were raised
in a small, regional circus...

309
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:45,644
...probably in a family of performers.

310
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:49,101
That some traumatic event possibly
connected to the scar on your left arm...

311
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:51,975
...that you're trying to conceal,
led you to the continent...

312
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:55,038
...where you reinvented yourself
as a night club performer.

313
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:56,690
Nothing else?

314
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,927
That you take it upon yourself
to act as champion of the voiceless.

315
00:28:02,007 --> 00:28:06,632
Which you, no doubt, learned from our
mutual friend, Sister Leslie Thompkins.

316
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:09,365
One of the few people who knew me as a boy.

317
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:12,989
Yes. She was the one
who told me you were kind.

318
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:16,309
And she should know. She took me in too.

319
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:19,511
She takes in all of the helpless,
the hopeless...

320
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:22,078
...feeds them, protects them.

321
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:25,925
- I've been a fool.
- Bruce, what?

322
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:28,017
Fetch me a hansom, quickly.

323
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:05,457
Oh, Sister. You gave me a fright.

324
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:07,627
Marlene, what are you doing here?

325
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:11,113
A warm cot is waiting for you
and you're out here in the cold.

326
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:13,398
You've been at the bottle.

327
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:17,189
I'm sorry, Sister.
I was having trouble sleeping.

328
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:19,323
I needed my medicine.

329
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:24,840
I don't know where you're hiding it, but
your sort of medicine will kill you for sure.

330
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:27,225
Back to bed with ya.

331
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:51,395
Keep it, don't wait.

332
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:44,904
So, this is it then.

333
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,230
Well, I won't beg...

334
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,702
...and I won't go hysterical.

335
00:30:54,212 --> 00:30:56,648
I won't give you the satisfaction.

336
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,238
Know this...

337
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:06,626
...I forgive you.

338
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:41,042
Master Bruce, I took the liberty of...

339
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:09,789
- Bruce, I know how much Sister Leslie...
- What, Alfred? What did you say?

340
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,725
Nothing at all, sir.

341
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:17,147
I presumed and I presumed incorrectly.
What have you there?

342
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:20,252
It's a membership pin from the Dionysus Club.

343
00:32:20,332 --> 00:32:22,054
It was at the scene.

344
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:25,455
The Batman will return it
to Gordon after my analysis.

345
00:32:25,535 --> 00:32:28,540
Yours? You were there,
you might've dropped it.

346
00:32:29,192 --> 00:32:32,281
No. There's blood splattered on the pin.

347
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:35,308
It was there when the murder
happened. Mine wasn't.

348
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:38,297
This does, however,
narrow the field considerably.

349
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:41,391
Including the Mayor,
Harvey, even Hugo Strange.

350
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:43,729
Virtually every wealthy man in Gotham.

351
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:46,896
Testing your fingerprints theory again?

352
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:50,236
You know, they'll never admit
that sort of thing as evidence.

353
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:53,987
There are no prints,
just a few fibers in the fastener.

354
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,239
If I could match these...

355
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,742
It will have to wait.
I've laid out your mourning clothes.

356
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:02,074
I have my own manner of mourning.

357
00:33:03,076 --> 00:33:06,699
- Revenge.
- Her blood cries out for it.

358
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,267
Does it, sir?

359
00:33:08,347 --> 00:33:11,987
"Beloved, avenge not yourselves,
vengeance is mine.

360
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:15,103
"I will repay," sayeth the Lord.

361
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:19,127
She wouldn't want you to be alone right now.

362
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:21,576
It's how I work best, Alfred.

363
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:33,973
But I can pay my respects.

364
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:43,118
For as much as it hath
pleased almighty God...

365
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:45,388
...of his great mercy...

366
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:50,693
...to take unto himself the soul
of our dear sister here departed.

367
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:53,496
We therefore commit her body to the ground.

368
00:33:54,543 --> 00:33:56,465
Earth to earth.

369
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:58,004
Ashes to ashes.

370
00:33:58,084 --> 00:33:59,885
Dust to dust.

371
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:04,507
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life...

372
00:34:04,587 --> 00:34:06,968
...through our Lord Jesus Christ...

373
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:09,761
...who shall change
the body of our low estate...

374
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:13,928
...that it may be like
unto his glorious body.

375
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:16,101
Amen.

376
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,699
Amen.

377
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:36,100
Mr. Wayne?

378
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:40,625
Dr. Hugo Strange, isn't it?

379
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:42,968
You know me.

380
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:47,449
I read your monograph on the habits
of the clinically degenerate lunatics.

381
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:50,569
You believe their cure lies in surgery.

382
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:53,523
Ablation of the frontal cortex.

383
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:56,312
The scalpel solves everything.

384
00:34:56,392 --> 00:35:01,393
- You knew Sister Leslie?
- No, I came for professional reasons.

385
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:09,371
He is here. I am certain of it.

386
00:35:09,451 --> 00:35:10,826
Jack.

387
00:35:10,906 --> 00:35:15,478
His sick mind burns with the hatred
of all that he sees as evil and wicked.

388
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:19,115
Hatred of women. A hunger that never dies.

389
00:35:19,195 --> 00:35:22,920
It is strong. Overpowering.

390
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:26,939
- You know who he is?
- Pardon me, Mr. Wayne.

391
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:29,674
The Commissioner was wondering
if you'll be coming to the memorial.

392
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,609
Yes, Chief. I'll be right there.

393
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,016
Well?

394
00:35:37,096 --> 00:35:39,726
I should very much like to tell this...

395
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:44,363
...Batman I've heard so much
about all that I know.

396
00:35:44,953 --> 00:35:48,200
- Then why come to...
- You know everyone in town, Mr. Wayne.

397
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,172
I'm sure you could find a way to tell
the Batman to come to my office.

398
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,587
Tonight. Midnight.

399
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,949
Strange, I don't know who...

400
00:36:10,424 --> 00:36:12,118
Gotcha.

401
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:14,403
Let me go, geezer.

402
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:18,340
I'm afraid you lack the subtlety to be an
effective cat purse, young fellow, my lad.

403
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,287
And so near a bevy of policeman, too.

404
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,027
He didn't mean nothing, mister.

405
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:28,119
You idiot. You think that's how Sister Leslie
would want you to act at her own funeral?

406
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,702
But I'm hungry.

407
00:36:29,782 --> 00:36:32,521
Mister, Jason here is not worth the trouble.

408
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:34,623
Cut him loose, huh?

409
00:36:34,703 --> 00:36:35,859
Orphans.

410
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:38,661
Sister Leslie did what she could for us.

411
00:36:38,741 --> 00:36:41,381
Fed us, tried to teach us right.

412
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:45,101
Look, knock Jason around
a little if you want, but...

413
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:47,382
...please don't get the cops.

414
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:52,321
I occasionally have odd jobs that need doing.

415
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:54,443
Call upon me here.

416
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:56,437
You'll not go away hungry.

417
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:59,327
Shoo.

418
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:06,444
- Not so hasty, if you please.
- What?

419
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:10,559
I know I'm too old now to catch
the eye of a gent like you.

420
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:13,261
But my eyes are still good, yeah?

421
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:15,663
They see everything.

422
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:19,335
- I don't quite follow.
- Of course, my memory ain't so great.

423
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:22,621
I forget things all the time
for the right price.

424
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,940
Follow me, Mr. Bruce Wayne?

425
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,193
I recognized you sneaking
around the church yard.

426
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:32,114
- I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
- Afraid?

427
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:36,719
Oh, you'll be afraid all right,
Mr. High and Mighty Bruce Wayne.

428
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,581
When I tell the coppers what I know!

429
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:44,427
- Now, let's just settle down.
- Get your hands off me.

430
00:37:44,507 --> 00:37:49,148
If you think you can do me like you did
Sister Leslie, you're dead wrong, fella.

431
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:52,735
Now, what's all the commotion, granny?
Why don't we just quiet down a bit?

432
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:54,650
Arrest me, will ya?

433
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,206
I'm not the one you should be talking to.

434
00:37:57,286 --> 00:38:00,086
Am I, Mr. Bruce Wayne?

435
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:04,497
Find me at Skinner's End, everybody knows me!

436
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:07,715
You'll pay up if you know
what's good for you.

437
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:11,516
Or mark me... you'll hang!

438
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,542
Here you are.

439
00:38:49,622 --> 00:38:51,125
How punctual.

440
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,607
Even a bit early, Batman.

441
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:57,982
You should feel at home here
with my collection.

442
00:38:58,062 --> 00:39:01,890
Usually, it's on our own face,
that is the mask.

443
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,440
These masks, the ones you choose to wear...

444
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,955
...they show the true self.

445
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:12,794
Of course, you understand
why I couldn't say more.

446
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:24,343
Now, we both know
you cannot do your work on me.

447
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:26,295
I'm not a street walker.

448
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:29,197
It's antithetical to your neurosis.

449
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:32,384
I'd stake my professional reputation on it.

450
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:35,019
You can't!

451
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:55,398
Help me!

452
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:58,456
Stop. Please.

453
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:01,307
No, my God, no!

454
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:40,712
Arkham to police headquarters.
The Batman has murdered Dr. Strange...

455
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:43,961
...and escaped in the police airship.
He's heading right for you.

456
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:32,411
This way, fellas.

457
00:43:57,478 --> 00:43:58,996
Fire!

458
00:44:46,627 --> 00:44:48,278
No.

459
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:51,816
There he is!

460
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:28,274
- Keep firing, boys. Shoot to kill.
- Belay that order!

461
00:45:29,304 --> 00:45:30,910
Nice of you to join us, Commissioner.

462
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,462
Do you mind telling me exactly why we
shouldn't shoot the murdering lunatic...

463
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:38,083
- ...who's gutting whores all over town?
- Watch your tone, Chief.

464
00:45:38,163 --> 00:45:41,743
We have witnesses who saw the Batman
at the time of the Isley murder.

465
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,343
And what about the two men
he just killed at Arkham?

466
00:45:44,423 --> 00:45:46,641
We don't know what happened
for certain, Bulldog.

467
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:49,967
There'll be no lynch mob
on my watch, do you understand?

468
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:54,081
We catch him and if he's guilty,
he hangs, but I want him alive.

469
00:45:54,161 --> 00:45:56,815
Now fan out. Find him!

470
00:46:19,004 --> 00:46:22,823
Pick up everyone.
He could be anyone on the street.

471
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:44,262
Get in.

472
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:53,859
As you surmised, I get tired of Crest Hill.

473
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:56,988
I amuse myself by slumming with the unwashed.

474
00:46:57,068 --> 00:47:00,611
Do your downtown escapades
usually end with excessive bleeding?

475
00:47:04,132 --> 00:47:08,153
The belt and gloves must go immediately.
Any of the bat accoutrement.

476
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:11,296
They'll have the entire area cordoned off.

477
00:47:11,376 --> 00:47:13,477
Homes, carriages searched.

478
00:47:13,557 --> 00:47:17,132
It wouldn't do to have them
find your stage wear.

479
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,697
Hold! Hold, I say!

480
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,051
Open up, open up in the name of the law.

481
00:47:27,489 --> 00:47:29,568
Is there a problem, Officer?

482
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:34,499
No, Mr. Wayne. We've just been...

483
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:37,782
You should head home. Dangerous
characters on the streets tonight.

484
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:40,852
Duly noted. Anything else, gentlemen?

485
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,326
No. Excuse me, sir.

486
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:47,859
And madam. Have a wonderful night.

487
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,008
Lucky bugger.

488
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:55,804
You were very convincing.

489
00:47:55,884 --> 00:47:58,843
I'm an actress, darling. Didn't you know?

490
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:00,658
I'm the toast of Gotham.

491
00:48:00,738 --> 00:48:04,079
You, on the other hand,
would never make it out of the chorus.

492
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,449
You must commit completely to the role.

493
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:10,184
And how exactly do I do that, Ms. Kyle?

494
00:48:10,264 --> 00:48:13,537
Repetition. You must practice.

495
00:48:13,617 --> 00:48:16,669
Practice, practice.

496
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:27,459
I want another squad moving
into Cape Carmine. And then...

497
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:30,881
Commissioner! We found something, sir.

498
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:42,479
The boys just found her.

499
00:48:47,485 --> 00:48:49,337
Show me.

500
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:02,905
Well, I guess it's true what they say.

501
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:05,402
Practice makes perf...

502
00:49:13,644 --> 00:49:16,958
I had these brought up.
I have a rather large wardrobe.

503
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:20,018
The entire production is mine, you know?

504
00:49:20,701 --> 00:49:23,120
I'm not just another pretty face.

505
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,345
I feel a perfect fool for not
realizing your secret earlier.

506
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:32,166
When you first kissed my hand backstage,
I felt the callous on your palm...

507
00:49:32,246 --> 00:49:36,687
...and thought, "This man's got
the hands of a trapeze artist."

508
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,492
I saw the circus in the acrobatic
dismount you used in your show.

509
00:49:40,572 --> 00:49:43,528
And then of course,
your fighting style and the whip.

510
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:45,842
Expert lion tamer.

511
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:50,632
I grew up with those cats.

512
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:53,588
Looked after them, loved them.

513
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:55,657
Papa hated them.

514
00:49:55,737 --> 00:49:58,559
He wasn't a kind man to them or to me.

515
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:00,795
He was always threatening to shoot them.

516
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,510
And I believed him.

517
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:07,402
One day he tried to but someone
had taken the bullets out of his gun.

518
00:50:08,532 --> 00:50:12,006
And now, you look after all
those strays in Skinner's End.

519
00:50:12,086 --> 00:50:16,411
Someone has to. They don't have
anyone else to protect them.

520
00:50:16,491 --> 00:50:18,062
Until now.

521
00:50:18,142 --> 00:50:20,748
Until the Batman.

522
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:23,047
Does he have a story?

523
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,486
Selina...

524
00:50:25,566 --> 00:50:27,984
Oh, your parents.

525
00:50:29,603 --> 00:50:32,677
Are you making them pay? The criminals?

526
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:36,649
I was but... it'd never be enough.

527
00:50:37,129 --> 00:50:40,331
They couldn't ever pay enough. Could they?

528
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:55,867
They're here.

529
00:50:55,947 --> 00:50:58,366
Police! Put your hands in the air.

530
00:51:01,402 --> 00:51:03,105
What's the meaning of this?

531
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,289
Oh, a thousand pardons, Ms. Kyle.

532
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,330
For disturbing the sanctity
of a lady's bedchamber.

533
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,945
What do you want, Bullock?

534
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:15,370
Bruce Wayne, you're under arrest
for the murder of one Marlene Mahoney.

535
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,077
- Who?
- Oh, is that how it is now?

536
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:21,188
You've killed so many,
you don't even know their names.

537
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,013
Think hard, Wayne. Maybe you'll remember.

538
00:51:25,093 --> 00:51:27,469
You'll have a long time to think about it.

539
00:51:27,549 --> 00:51:31,385
Bruce, it'll be all right.
I'll contact Harvey. He'll clear this all up.

540
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:35,674
I wouldn't be countin' on Mr. Dent
being too helpful, lassie.

541
00:51:36,438 --> 00:51:40,458
He's the one who suggested
we look for Mr. Wayne in your hotel.

542
00:51:49,334 --> 00:51:51,903
Commissioner, James, this is absurd.

543
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:55,073
You can't imagine I'm actually the ripper.

544
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:58,975
Get him out of my sight.

545
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,442
The county of Gotham has abundant
evidence linking the accused...

546
00:52:16,522 --> 00:52:19,230
...to at least three
of these vicious murders.

547
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,722
Physical evidence...

548
00:52:20,802 --> 00:52:24,589
...a lapel pin of the Dionysus Club
to which Mr. Wayne is a member...

549
00:52:24,669 --> 00:52:29,394
...was discovered at the site of Sister
Leslie's murder. Also, an eye witness...

550
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:32,751
...who was overheard placing
Mr. Wayne at the scene of the crime.

551
00:52:32,831 --> 00:52:37,202
That witness, Marlene Mahony,
was subsequently discovered...

552
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:40,507
...mutilated in the same barbaric
manner as the other victims...

553
00:52:40,587 --> 00:52:44,876
...after reportedly attempting
to extort cash from the accused.

554
00:52:44,956 --> 00:52:47,462
Furthermore, the prisoner
was also acquainted...

555
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:50,228
...with reaper victim, Ms. Pamela Isley.

556
00:52:51,278 --> 00:52:53,701
One wonders how many other
lovely young wards...

557
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:57,772
Enough! Enough!
You've made your point, Mr. Prosecutor.

558
00:52:57,852 --> 00:53:01,476
The accused will be remanded to
the custody of Blackgate Penitentiary...

559
00:53:01,556 --> 00:53:04,863
...until such time as a trial by jury
can be arranged by the county.

560
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:09,349
If it please the court, as the nature
of these crimes is so detestable...

561
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:13,120
...and Mr. Wayne has ample financial
resources to escape justice...

562
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,947
...I request the court to not set bail.

563
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:20,374
Granted. Bailiff will remove
the prisoner to Blackgate Prison.

564
00:53:20,457 --> 00:53:22,325
Court adjourned.

565
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:35,309
Hey, Jack,
you're not the only one who can cut.

566
00:53:35,389 --> 00:53:37,845
Let's see if Wayne blood really is blue.

567
00:53:38,794 --> 00:53:40,558
Tell him.

568
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:51,209
Blackgate's real progressive.
Warden likes to encourage physical exercise.

569
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:53,106
You'll see.

570
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:58,502
The deluxe suite. Please, enjoy
your stay at the Hotel Blackgate.

571
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,750
Yeah, we're looking forward
to seeing you checkout.

572
00:54:12,093 --> 00:54:14,381
I love what you've done with the place.

573
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:17,685
Selina, what are you doing here?
This is no place for a lady.

574
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:20,337
You should see some
of the houses I've played to.

575
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:23,636
They make this seem
like a command performance.

576
00:54:24,238 --> 00:54:27,344
- You need to get out of here.
- No, you need to get out of here.

577
00:54:27,424 --> 00:54:29,857
When my friend has gone
to all the trouble of building...

578
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:32,707
...this well-constructed gilded frame for me?

579
00:54:32,787 --> 00:54:36,528
Your friend? You think one
of your friends is framing you?

580
00:54:36,608 --> 00:54:39,873
One of my mentors says that
when you eliminate the impossible...

581
00:54:39,953 --> 00:54:43,954
...whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth.

582
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:48,211
That's a lot of eyewash.
You must liberate yourself immediately.

583
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:50,752
Unfortunately, my nocturnal
habits preclude me...

584
00:54:50,882 --> 00:54:53,641
...from providing an adequate
account of my whereabouts.

585
00:54:53,721 --> 00:54:57,715
Well, you'll just have to explain
to Gordon that you are the Batman.

586
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,724
What? I think not.

587
00:54:59,804 --> 00:55:04,147
You must. Batman has an ironclad
alibi for the first murder.

588
00:55:04,227 --> 00:55:09,303
You'll be released. Gotham needs the Batman
to help rid the streets of this killer.

589
00:55:09,383 --> 00:55:13,150
I'm sorry, Selina. I can't.
The Batman's effectiveness depends upon...

590
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,877
Every moment you're in here
puts women in danger.

591
00:55:15,957 --> 00:55:20,247
If you won't tell Gordon,
then I will. Immediately.

592
00:55:20,327 --> 00:55:22,250
He'll never believe you.

593
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,381
He'll believe this.

594
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:29,172
I'll be damned if I'll let
another girl be murdered...

595
00:55:29,252 --> 00:55:32,126
...so you can keep your precious secret.

596
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:36,828
I'm sorry, Bruce, but I think ultimately
you'll find this was all for the best.

597
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,206
Chow time, your highness.

598
00:55:52,744 --> 00:55:55,832
Listen to me, bring this to
my townhouse on Bell Avenue...

599
00:55:55,912 --> 00:56:00,151
- ...and my man there will give you $100.
- If you think I can be bought...

600
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:03,586
Get it there within 30 minutes,
he'll give you $200.

601
00:56:15,482 --> 00:56:17,468
Yes! Yes!

602
00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:19,986
- Give it to him!
- Come on!

603
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,264
Lay him out!

604
00:56:27,244 --> 00:56:30,077
Come on, put up a fight for Christ's sake!

605
00:56:33,634 --> 00:56:36,106
Who is next?

606
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:39,292
Who will face Cyrus Gold?

607
00:56:39,372 --> 00:56:41,222
I'll give it a whirl.

608
00:56:43,894 --> 00:56:47,868
No weaklings. Can't get good
enough odds against you.

609
00:56:47,948 --> 00:56:51,472
I'll beat you in private, later.

610
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:53,386
No time like the present.

611
00:57:33,526 --> 00:57:36,471
While you're sittin' on your ass,
there's a damn donnybrook in there!

612
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:39,900
Shore up the west gate!
Fetch the riot gear from the arsenal!

613
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:58,522
May I help you, miss?

614
00:57:58,602 --> 00:58:01,057
Yes, I need to see
Commissioner Gordon immediately.

615
00:58:01,137 --> 00:58:04,361
- I'm afraid, that's impossible.
- I must insist, it's quite urgent.

616
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:07,147
You never slow down, do you?

617
00:58:07,227 --> 00:58:11,588
As soon as one lover boy is unavailable,
you're on to the next chump.

618
00:58:11,998 --> 00:58:15,435
I can imagine what I ever saw
in a whore like you.

619
00:58:17,405 --> 00:58:19,826
Better sheath those claws, kitten.

620
00:58:19,906 --> 00:58:21,728
Someone is liable to get hurt.

621
00:58:21,808 --> 00:58:25,411
And sooner or later, you will.

622
00:58:29,417 --> 00:58:30,722
James isn't here.

623
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:34,157
He's down at the fairgrounds,
making sure everything's shipshape.

624
00:58:34,237 --> 00:58:38,408
Tomorrow is the big day. You'll have
to scratch up some business elsewhere.

625
00:58:39,893 --> 00:58:41,946
The fairground, hurry.

626
00:58:59,332 --> 00:59:01,168
This is it.

627
00:59:01,248 --> 00:59:04,671
You're off your nut.
We're in the middle of nothin'.

628
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:07,403
This is where that geezer told us to go.

629
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:09,906
I can read, can't I?

630
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:12,849
So you keep tellin' us.

631
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:15,762
Come on, he said to unload it here.

632
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:22,223
I still say we take the wagon, the horse,
and whatever this is and skedaddle.

633
00:59:22,303 --> 00:59:24,521
Serve him right for being so trusting.

634
00:59:24,601 --> 00:59:26,234
But he fed us.

635
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:30,361
We're gonna do the job, Jason.
Now shut your boom box and push.

636
00:59:40,204 --> 00:59:42,636
Good job. Now, go.

637
01:00:25,616 --> 01:00:27,418
What are you doing here?

638
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,506
You're Ms. Kyle, the actress, aren't you?

639
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:35,428
Yes, Commissioner,
we met before, at the preview.

640
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:37,364
I thought I was all alone.

641
01:00:37,444 --> 01:00:41,297
Embarrassing as it sounds,
you gave me quite a start.

642
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,739
Commissioner? Selina?

643
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:12,807
- Mrs. Gordon, don't be alarmed.
- What do you want?

644
01:01:12,887 --> 01:01:15,223
I need to talk to your husband. Is he home?

645
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:18,605
You mustn't harm him. He's a good man.

646
01:01:18,685 --> 01:01:21,174
The best man in this horrible city.

647
01:01:21,254 --> 01:01:23,394
Did a woman come here looking for him?

648
01:01:23,474 --> 01:01:26,797
A woman? Walking here off the streets?

649
01:01:26,877 --> 01:01:28,762
I should hope not.

650
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:34,484
No! You're not allowed in there!

651
01:02:24,718 --> 01:02:26,586
Where is he?

652
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,793
Doing what he needs to do.

653
01:02:29,873 --> 01:02:31,595
His holy work.

654
01:02:31,675 --> 01:02:33,781
Cleaning the scum from Gotham.

655
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:35,683
He needs to be severe.

656
01:02:36,497 --> 01:02:39,452
But not with us. No.

657
01:02:39,532 --> 01:02:42,418
No, he's gentle as a lamb with us.

658
01:02:43,203 --> 01:02:47,077
He simply burns the sin out of us.

659
01:02:47,157 --> 01:02:48,806
We need him to.

660
01:02:49,442 --> 01:02:51,210
Good Lord.

661
01:02:52,245 --> 01:02:55,301
It's the woman's sins that are the worst.

662
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:57,921
Because they're hidden inside.

663
01:02:58,001 --> 01:03:01,587
James brings them out into the light.

664
01:03:02,522 --> 01:03:04,974
Where is he?

665
01:03:06,627 --> 01:03:09,630
I suspected, of course.
Who else, but Bruce Wayne...

666
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:13,054
...has either the time
or resources to create the Batman.

667
01:03:13,134 --> 01:03:16,508
We'll see to this immediately.
Let me fetch my things.

668
01:03:17,038 --> 01:03:19,647
I suppose it's a dreadful
betrayal of confidence.

669
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:22,129
But I simply see no other way.

670
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:24,698
No, no, Ms. Kyle, I understand completely.

671
01:03:24,778 --> 01:03:28,465
It's in your very nature to play false
with your illicit lover.

672
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,605
An action ideal to expose...

673
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:35,939
...your absolute internal corruption.

674
01:03:56,426 --> 01:04:00,507
A 7% solution of laudanum,
3% heroin and alcohol.

675
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:03,705
Barbara's physician
prescribes it for acute insomnia.

676
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:06,687
Effective, is it not?

677
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:11,111
But it's hardly a cure for harlotry.

678
01:04:11,521 --> 01:04:15,713
Only, I. Only Jack
has the remedy for that vile ill.

679
01:04:18,498 --> 01:04:21,918
Damnation! You'll pay for that, slut!

680
01:05:09,382 --> 01:05:12,472
You can't get far.
The oversweet fragrance you used...

681
01:05:12,552 --> 01:05:16,606
...to cover your putrefying
stench nearly burns my eyes.

682
01:05:21,811 --> 01:05:23,844
Come to Jack, you little...

683
01:05:49,423 --> 01:05:51,240
Nice try.

684
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,632
Wayne promised this World's Fair...

685
01:05:54,712 --> 01:05:57,837
...would be a paradise
of cleanliness and light.

686
01:05:57,917 --> 01:06:00,534
But what does a light in the darkness do?

687
01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:02,522
It draws flies.

688
01:06:02,602 --> 01:06:06,437
Vile, unclean, like you.

689
01:06:09,475 --> 01:06:14,235
But for every one of you
I eradicate, two more arrive.

690
01:06:14,315 --> 01:06:18,722
I promised the people of Gotham
to clean scum of the streets...

691
01:06:18,802 --> 01:06:22,226
...thieves, murderers, confidence men...

692
01:06:22,306 --> 01:06:25,678
...immigrants, illiterates, anarchists.

693
01:06:25,758 --> 01:06:28,411
This city seems to spawn them.

694
01:06:31,098 --> 01:06:35,405
But it's whores... you painted
whores that are the worst.

695
01:06:35,485 --> 01:06:39,923
All rosy-cheeked,
soft and round on the outside...

696
01:06:40,003 --> 01:06:42,009
...but on the inside...

697
01:06:44,778 --> 01:06:48,016
My death prove...

698
01:06:48,696 --> 01:06:49,939
...innocent.

699
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:53,640
Yes. Sadly, your death will exonerate Wayne.

700
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:55,943
But it will be worth it.

701
01:06:56,023 --> 01:06:59,213
Your blood shall christen this fair, woman.

702
01:06:59,293 --> 01:07:03,005
Your corruption and decay
will spill down over this carnival...

703
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:05,698
...as a warning to all your kind.

704
01:07:06,767 --> 01:07:08,556
Shall we begin?

705
01:07:08,936 --> 01:07:12,539
This may take quite some time.

706
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:28,728
Left handed.

707
01:07:28,808 --> 01:07:31,444
Oh, the nuns beat that wickedness out of me.

708
01:07:31,524 --> 01:07:33,580
Always use my right.

709
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,428
Except for Jack's work.

710
01:08:00,124 --> 01:08:02,622
Can you speak? Have you any other injuries?

711
01:08:02,702 --> 01:08:05,408
No. I'm... Bruce!

712
01:08:21,108 --> 01:08:23,663
You were right. I'm a trained fighter.

713
01:08:23,743 --> 01:08:26,032
Bare knuckle champion at Culpepper.

714
01:08:26,112 --> 01:08:28,532
London Prize Ring rules.

715
01:08:28,612 --> 01:08:31,792
There were no rules at Antietam,
though, were there, James?

716
01:08:31,872 --> 01:08:34,371
There are no rules in hell.

717
01:08:41,127 --> 01:08:43,790
The things I saw during the war...

718
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:48,020
...the entirety of humanity's
evil was there for all to see...

719
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,736
...on the inside of every man.

720
01:08:54,874 --> 01:08:59,359
But nothing compared to the corruption
of every painted camp follower.

721
01:08:59,896 --> 01:09:03,537
The vile diseases they spread,
destroy good men...

722
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:06,801
...destroyed them in both body and mind.

723
01:10:22,378 --> 01:10:26,100
I saw your work on your wife.

724
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,055
Wives? They are the worst prostitutes of all.

725
01:10:29,135 --> 01:10:31,508
Sell themselves too cheap.

726
01:10:31,588 --> 01:10:35,658
Wives, brothers, that slut nun of yours.

727
01:10:51,358 --> 01:10:54,851
Look, Bruce, the world
of tomorrow is burning.

728
01:10:54,931 --> 01:10:58,425
Exposing the ashes
of degradation hiding beneath.

729
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:01,151
This is where we belong!

730
01:11:02,285 --> 01:11:03,553
No.

731
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:12,546
I paid Houdini $300 for that trick.

732
01:11:15,381 --> 01:11:18,234
Fight's over. Time to go.

733
01:11:36,069 --> 01:11:37,587
Gordon!

734
01:12:42,384 --> 01:12:44,540
You should have run when you had that chance.

735
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:49,259
Well, I was badly doped up.
My actions were quite questionable.

736
01:12:53,179 --> 01:12:55,542
Help them in, lads. Lively now.

737
01:12:55,622 --> 01:13:00,094
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
And there you'll always be, sir.

738
01:13:13,066 --> 01:13:15,067
Do these belong to you, Alfred?

739
01:13:15,617 --> 01:13:18,855
Good Lord. No, sir. They belong to you.

740
01:13:35,405 --> 01:13:37,810
Gone. All gone.

741
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:40,312
And the hope of Gotham with it.

742
01:13:40,392 --> 01:13:42,052
It was all phony anyway.

743
01:13:42,132 --> 01:13:44,214
We'll make something new.

744
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,799
Something better.

745
01:13:47,305 --> 01:14:47,601
