2
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,804
Anything goes

3
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,273
Anything goes

4
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,544
Anything goes

5
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,255
Anything goes

6
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,609
Be careful.

7
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,669
You never told me you spoke
my language, Dr. Jones.

8
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,672
Only on special occasions.

9
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,091
So, it is true?

10
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,802
You found Nurhachi?

11
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,637
You know I did.

12
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:43,057
Last night one of your boys
tried to get Nurhachi

13
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,559
without paying for him.

14
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,561
You have insulted my son.

15
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,771
No, you have insulted me.

16
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:51,190
I spared his life.

17
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,985
Aren't you going to introduce us?

18
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,324
This is Willie Scott.

19
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:03,786
This is Indiana Jones,
famous archeologist.

20
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,457
Well, I thought archeologists
were always funny little men

21
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,667
searching for their mommies.

22
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,002
Mummies.

23
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,713
Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me,

24
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,800
and he's going to deliver him now.

25
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,220
Say, who is this Nurhachi?

26
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,848
Put the gun away, sonny.

27
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,396
I suggest you give me what you owe me

28
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,731
or anything goes.

29
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,826
Open it.

30
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,377
The diamond, Lao.

31
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,213
The deal was for the diamond.

32
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,904
Oh, Lao...

33
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,368
To your very good health.

34
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,412
Lao! He put a hole...

35
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,832
He put two holes
in my dress from Paris!

36
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,250
Sit down!

37
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:39,924
Now, you bring me Nurhachi.

38
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,010
My pleasure.

39
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,512
Who on Earth is this Nurhachi?

40
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,351
Here he is.

41
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:57,275
This Nurhachi's a real small guy.

42
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,322
Inside are the remains of Nurhachi,

43
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,785
first Emperor of Manchu Dynasty.

44
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,455
Welcome home, old boy.

45
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:23,801
And now, you give me the diamond.

46
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,763
Are you trying to develop
a sense of humor,

47
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,723
or am I going deaf?

48
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,438
What's that?

49
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,398
Antidote.

50
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,400
To what?

51
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,237
The poison you just drank, Dr. Jones.

52
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:50,661
The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.

53
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:00,963
- Lao.
- Lao!

54
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,133
You keep the girl. I find another.

55
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:09,972
Good service here.

56
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,766
That's not a waiter.

57
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,852
Wu Han's an old friend.
Game's not over, Lao.

58
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,146
Antidote.

59
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,204
Indy...

60
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,293
Don't worry, Wu Han,
I'll get you out of here.

61
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,546
Not this time, Indy.

62
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,966
I followed you on many adventures,

63
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:49,220
but into the great unknown mystery,
I go first, Indy.

64
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:56,018
Don't be sad, Dr. Jones.

65
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,646
You will soon be joining him.

66
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,946
Too much to drink, Dr. Jones?

67
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,291
Oh, nuts!

68
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:13,346
- The antidote.
- Where's the diamond?

69
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,918
No!

70
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,340
Stay there!

71
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,383
Come on.

72
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,387
I don't want to die!

73
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,233
Who are you?

74
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,865
Wow! Holy smoke!

75
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,450
Crash landing!

76
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,161
Short Round, step on it.

77
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,331
Okeydokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.

78
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:06,042
For crying out loud,
there's a kid driving the car!

79
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,851
Wow! Wow.

80
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,356
Where's the antidote? Let me have it.

81
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,774
Listen, I just met you, for Christ's sakes.

82
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,567
Give me...

83
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,027
I'm not that kind of girl.

84
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,321
Hey, Dr. Jones, no time for love.

85
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,239
We got company.

86
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,371
Oh, I hope you choke.

87
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,876
No shooting.

88
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,185
Okay, you asked for it.

89
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,582
This is fun!

90
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,502
Here, hold this.

91
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,010
Where's my gun? Where's my gun?

92
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,888
I burned my fingers,
and I cracked a nail!

93
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,733
Dr. Jones... I'm Art Weber.

94
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,444
I spoke with your assistant.

95
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,529
We've managed to secure three seats,

96
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,406
but there might be
a slight inconvenience

97
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:04,118
as you will be riding
on a cargo full of live poultry.

98
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,202
Is he kidding?

99
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,663
Madam, it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

100
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:12,334
Heavens, aren't you Willie Scott,
the famous American female vocalist?

101
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,963
Owe you a gin.

102
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,640
Nice try, Lao Che.

103
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,273
Good-bye, Dr. Jones.

104
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,313
So, what are you supposed to be,
a lion tamer?

105
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,149
I'm allowing you to tag along,

106
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,277
so why don't you give
your mouth a rest?

107
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,655
Okay, doll?

108
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,823
What do you mean, "tag along"?

109
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,450
Ever since you got into my club,

110
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,661
you haven't been able
to take your eyes off me.

111
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,246
Oh, yeah?

112
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,676
Oh, no.

113
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:11,096
Oh, no! Mister, mister...

114
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,848
Oh, mister, wake up. Please, mister...

115
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,850
You call him Dr. Jones, doll!

116
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,520
Okay, Dr. Jones, Dr. Jones.
Oh, wake up, please!

117
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,481
Are we there already? Oh, good.

118
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,732
No.

119
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,571
- No one's flying the plane!
- Oh, boy...

120
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,407
They've all gone!

121
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,497
You know how to fly, don't you?

122
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,248
NO. Do you?

123
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,708
Oh, no.

124
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,210
- Oh, my God!
- How hard can it be?

125
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:43,420
- I'm gonna faint.
- Altimeter! Okay.

126
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,839
Air speed. Okay.

127
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:46,924
Fuel...

128
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:49,218
Fuel?

129
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,053
Fuel?

130
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,152
I think we got a big problem.

131
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,737
- Dr. Jones!
- Shorty!

132
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,699
Dr. Jones! No more parachutes!

133
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,451
Shorty!

134
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,120
- Come on, give me a hand!
- What's that?

135
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,538
Move the box!

136
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,498
Dr. Jones, you're crazy!

137
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,796
Shorty, get our stuff!

138
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,429
A boat? We're not sinking.

139
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,264
We're crashing!

140
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,434
Grab on, Shorty! Grab on!

141
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,686
- Lady, I can't breathe!
- Tight!

142
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,727
Slow it down!

143
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,814
That wasn't so bad, was it?

144
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,997
Put on the brakes!

145
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,712
I hate the water, and I hate being wet,

146
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,923
and I hate you!

147
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,050
Good. Good!

148
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:19,952
Dr. Jones?

149
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,538
I'm all right, Shorty.

150
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,164
You Okay?

151
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,259
Where are we, anyway?

152
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:41,807
India.

153
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,392
How do you know that?

154
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,631
I sure hope this means dinner.

155
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,383
God, I'm starving.

156
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,551
Thank you.

157
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,310
I can't eat this.

158
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,982
That's more food
than these people eat in a week.

159
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,566
They're starving.

160
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,485
Oh, I'm sorry. You can have...

161
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,778
Eat it.

162
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,991
I'm not hungry.

163
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:09,121
You're insulting them,
and you're embarrassing me.

164
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,249
- Eat it.
- Eat it.

165
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:13,875
Eat.

166
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:29,891
Bad news coming.

167
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:34,646
Can you provide us with a guide
to take us to Delhi?

168
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,566
I'm a professor.
I have to get back to my university.

169
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,860
Yes. Sajnu will guide you.

170
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:47,617
On the way to Delhi,
you will stop at Pankot.

171
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,413
Pankot is not on the way to Delhi.

172
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,749
You will go to Pankot Palace.

173
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,626
I thought the palace had been deserted
since the 1850s.

174
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,504
No. Now there is a new Maharajah,

175
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:04,634
and again the palace
has the power of the Dark Light.

176
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,430
It is that place kill my people.

177
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,766
What has happened here?

178
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,976
The evil start in Pankot,

179
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,854
then like monsoon,

180
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,484
it moves darkness

181
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,489
over all country,

182
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,991
over all country.

183
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:29,826
The evil?

184
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,414
What evil?

185
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,166
See? Bad news.

186
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,669
You listen to Suwamu. You leave Lanka.

187
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,007
They came from palace

188
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:50,138
and took Sivalinga from our village.

189
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,390
Took what?

190
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,267
It's a stone, a sacred stone

191
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,186
from a shrine that protects the village.

192
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,022
It is why Siva brought you here.

193
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,742
We weren't brought here.

194
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,120
Our plane crashed.

195
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,080
It crashed.

196
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,706
No, no.

197
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:22,546
We prayed to Siva to help us
find the stone.

198
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:28,844
It was Siva who made you fall
from the sky.

199
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:35,725
So you will go to Pankot Palace
to find Sivalinga

200
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,353
and bring back to us.

201
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:40,897
Bring back to us.

202
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,983
Bring back to us.

203
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,235
Bring back to us.

204
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,114
Dr. Jones, did they make
the plane crash

205
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,824
to get you here?

206
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:55,162
No, Shorty, it's just a ghost story.
Don't worry about it.

207
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,793
They took the stone from here.

208
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,677
Was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river?

209
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,845
Yes.

210
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,805
With three lines across it

211
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,348
representing the three levels
of the universe.

212
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,017
- That's right.
- Yes.

213
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,811
I've seen stones like the one you lost.

214
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:24,065
But why would Maharajah
take the sacred stone from here?

215
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,736
They says we must pray
to their evil god.

216
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,239
We says we will not.

217
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,492
Excuse me, I don't understand
how one rock

218
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,244
could destroy a whole village.

219
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,001
He's saying when
the sacred stone was taken,

220
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,629
the village wells dried up,
and the river turned to sand.

221
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,344
The crops were swallowed by the earth,

222
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,639
and the animals laid down
and turned to dust.

223
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,309
Then one night
there was a fire in the fields.

224
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,021
The men went out to fight the fire.

225
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:06,233
When they came back,
the women were crying in the darkness.

226
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:18,495
Children.

227
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,207
He says they stole their children.

228
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,842
Sankara! Sankara...

229
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,055
Ranjit!

230
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,142
Ranjit!

231
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,294
Sankara.

232
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:08,438
Little boy escaped from the evil palace.

233
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,317
Many other children still there.

234
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,444
What we do, Dr. Jones?

235
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,287
What you think?

236
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:30,001
I think that somebody believes
the good luck rock from this village

237
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,545
is one of the lost Sankara Stones.

238
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,255
What is Sankara?

239
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,675
Fortune and glory, kid.

240
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,970
Fortune and glory.

241
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:08,206
Willie, quit monkeying around
on that thing.

242
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,300
Oh, wait a second! Indy!

243
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,636
I can't go to Delhi like this!

244
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:25,682
We're not going to Delhi, doll.
We're going to Pankot Palace.

245
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,350
Pankot?

246
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,853
I can't go to Pankot! I'm a singer.

247
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,564
Oh, I need to call my agent.
ls there a phone?

248
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,315
Anybody, I need a phone!

249
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:28,203
Oh, quit complaining.
This is expensive stuff.

250
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:32,373
You come to America with me
and we get job in circus.

251
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,584
You like that? You like America?

252
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,544
You're my best friend.

253
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,630
You're my best friend.

254
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,966
What big birds!

255
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,136
Those aren't big birds, sweetheart.

256
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,764
They're giant vampire bats.

257
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,766
Bats?

258
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:01,486
Pipe down, you big baboon.
This doesn't hurt.

259
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,989
You know what you really need?
You really need a bath.

260
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:16,209
Ha-ha, very funny.

261
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:18,878
Very funny.

262
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,130
Very funny.

263
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:22,799
All Wet.

264
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,427
I was happy in Shanghai.

265
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,807
I had a little house and a garden.

266
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,184
My friends were rich.

267
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,645
We went to parties
all the time in limousines.

268
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,939
I hate being outside!

269
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,695
I'm a singer! I could lose my voice!

270
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,825
I think we'll camp here tonight.

271
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,120
Cut it out.

272
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,211
- What do you got?
- Two sixes.

273
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,964
Aha-ha, three aces. I win.

274
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,675
Two more game, I have all your money.

275
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,555
It's poker, Shorty, anything can happen.

276
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:13,558
Where did you find
your little bodyguard?

277
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,019
I didn't find him, I caught him.

278
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,228
What?

279
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,565
Shorty's family were killed
when the Japanese bombed Shanghai.

280
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,650
He's been living on the streets
since he was four.

281
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:26,446
I caught him trying to pick my pocket,
didn't I, short stuff?

282
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,160
Biggest trouble with her is the noise.

283
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:43,129
Hey! You cheat, Dr. Jones. You cheat!

284
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,756
- What do you mean?
- You take four card.

285
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,635
- You pay now.
- Oh, they were stuck together.

286
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,011
- No stuck. No mistake.
- They were stuck together.

287
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,137
It's a mistake.

288
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,264
I'm very little. You cheat very big.

289
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:56,351
Dr. Jones, you cheat!

290
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:58,269
You pay money. You owe me ten cent.

291
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,980
Look at this. Look at this.

292
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,569
You accuse me of cheating.
You're cheating.

293
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,786
You make me poor. No fun.

294
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,579
Play with you no fun.

295
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,540
- I quit.
- I quit, too.

296
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,751
This place is completely surrounded.

297
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,045
The entire place is crawling
with living things.

298
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,506
That's why they call it
the jungle, sweetheart

299
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:28,091
Oh, my God, what else is out there?

300
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,801
Willie, wait...

301
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,599
Willie, Willie...

302
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,394
What is that?
Is that short for something?

303
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:43,314
"Willie" is my professional name,
Indiana.

304
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,526
Hey, lady, you call him Dr. Jones.

305
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,444
My professional name.

306
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,865
Why are you dragging us off
to this deserted palace?

307
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,575
Fortune and glory?

308
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,077
Fortune and glory.

309
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,080
Well...

310
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,791
this is a piece of an old manuscript.

311
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,878
This pictograph represents Sankara,
a priest.

312
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,130
Scram.

313
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:11,008
Gentle. Gentle.
This is hundreds of years old.

314
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,468
Is that some kind of writing?

315
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,137
Yeah, it's Sanskrit.

316
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,221
Cut it out.

317
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,724
It's part of the legend of Sankara.

318
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,184
He climbs Mount Kalisa
where he meets Siva,

319
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,686
the Hindu god.

320
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,814
That's Siva?
And what's he handing the priest?

321
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,150
- Rocks.
- Stop.

322
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,695
He told him to go forth and combat evil.

323
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,156
And to help him,
he gave him five sacred stones

324
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,991
with magical properties.

325
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,576
Magic rocks?

326
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,077
My grandpa was a magician.

327
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,455
He spent his entire life
with a rabbit in his pocket

328
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:41,539
and pigeons up his sleeves.

329
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:44,959
He made a lot of children happy
and died a very poor man.

330
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:48,087
Magic rocks. Fortune and glory.

331
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,131
Sweet dreams, Dr. Jones.

332
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,717
Where are you going?

333
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,136
I'd sleep closer, if I were you.

334
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,680
For safety's sake.

335
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:01,184
Dr. Jones, I'd be safer
sleeping with a snake.

336
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:05,772
I said, cut it out!

337
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,778
I hate that elephant.

338
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,641
Indy, look!

339
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:46,395
I see it, Shorty. That's it. Pankot Palace.

340
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,143
Dr. Jones, what you look at?

341
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,146
Don't come up here.

342
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,404
No! No, no, no, no! Don't leave! No!

343
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:21,407
No,no,no,no,no!

344
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,242
Oh, baby elephant, stay here!

345
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,119
Oh, no! Indy!

346
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,788
They're stealing our rides!

347
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,832
We walk from here.

348
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,787
Hello.

349
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:10,581
I should say you look rather lost.

350
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,834
But then I cannot imagine
where in the world

351
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,920
the three of you would look at home.

352
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,631
We're not lost.
We're on our way to Delhi.

353
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,633
This is Miss Scott.

354
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,510
This is Mr. Round.

355
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,970
Short Round.

356
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,888
My name is Indiana Jones.

357
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,308
Dr. Jones, the eminent archeologist?

358
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:31,560
Hard to believe, isn't it?

359
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:35,982
I remember first hearing your name
when I was up at Oxford.

360
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:39,151
I'm Chattar Lal,
Prime Minister to His Highness,

361
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:41,112
the Maharajah of Pankot.

362
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,072
I'm enchanted.

363
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,325
Enchanted. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

364
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,411
Welcome to Pankot Palace!

365
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:53,249
Enchanted, huh?

366
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:07,096
Shorty, where's my razor?

367
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:36,375
We are fortunate tonight
to have so many unexpected visitors.

368
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,502
- This is Captain...
-...Blumburtt.

369
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:40,046
11th Poona Rifles.

370
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:43,007
And you, sir, are Dr. Jones, I presume.

371
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,592
I am, Captain.

372
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:48,721
Captain Blumburtt and his troops
are on a routine inspection tour.

373
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:52,349
The British find it amusing
to inspect us at their convenience.

374
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:56,854
I do hope, sir, that it's not
inconvenient to you, sir.

375
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,566
The British worry so about their empire.

376
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:03,652
Makes us all feel like
well-cared-for children.

377
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,332
You look beautiful.

378
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,210
I think the Maharajah
is swimming in loot.

379
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:22,838
Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
coming here after all.

380
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,216
You look like a princess.

381
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:29,011
Mr. Lal, what do they call
the Maharajah's wife?

382
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:32,181
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.

383
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,349
How interesting.

384
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:36,435
Well, maybe it's because
he hasn't found the right woman.

385
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:52,284
His Supreme Highness,

386
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,913
guardian of Pankot tradition,

387
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,708
the Maharajah of Pankot,

388
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,878
Zalim Singh.

389
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:26,443
That's the Maharajah?

390
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,237
A kid?

391
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,200
Maybe he like older women.

392
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,627
Captain Blumburtt was just telling me

393
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:46,172
something of the interesting
history of the palace,

394
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:48,883
the importance it played in the mutiny.

395
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:53,220
It seems the British never forget
the Mutiny of 1857.

396
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:56,682
Yes, well, you know, I think
there are other events,

397
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,976
before the mutiny, going back a century,

398
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:01,854
back to the time of Clive,
that are more interesting.

399
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:04,356
And what events are those, Dr. Jones?

400
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,693
Well, if memory serves me correctly,
this area, this province,

401
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:10,613
was the center of activity
for the Thuggee.

402
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:15,576
Snake... Surprise.

403
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:17,870
What's the surprise?

404
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:30,382
Dr. Jones, you know perfectly well

405
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:32,927
the Thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century.

406
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,637
Yes, of course.

407
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,139
The Thuggee was an obscenity

408
00:42:37,473 --> 00:42:40,309
that worshipped Kali
with human sacrifices.

409
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:43,437
The British Army
nicely did away with them.

410
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,985
Well, I suppose stories
of the Thuggee die hard.

411
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:52,279
There are no stories any more.

412
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:54,657
I'm not so sure.

413
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,409
We came from a small village.

414
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:58,661
The peasants there told us

415
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:01,080
Pankot Palace was growing
powerful again

416
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,332
because of some ancient evil.

417
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,584
Village stories, Dr. Jones.

418
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:08,420
They're just fear and folklore.

419
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:13,175
You're beginning to worry
Captain Blumburtt.

420
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:19,431
I'm not worried, Mr. Prime Minister,
just interested.

421
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:37,825
What? You are not eating?

422
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,537
I had bugs for lunch.

423
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:46,917
Give me your hat.

424
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:49,712
VVhy?

425
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:51,922
'Cause I'm gonna puke in it.

426
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:58,220
You know, the villagers also told us
Pankot Palace had taken something.

427
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:01,265
Dr. Jones, in our country,

428
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:04,601
it's not usual for a guest
to insult his host.

429
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,021
I'm sorry.

430
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,940
I thought we were talking about folklore.

431
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:14,069
Excuse me, sir,
do you have anything simple, like soup?

432
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:18,949
What exactly was it
they say was stolen?

433
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:21,493
A sacred rock.

434
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,749
You see, Captain, a rock!

435
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:45,934
Something connected the villagers' rock

436
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:49,104
and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones.

437
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:53,442
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors.

438
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:56,111
I seem to remember that in Honduras

439
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:58,238
you were accused of being
a grave robber

440
00:44:58,322 --> 00:45:00,032
rather than an archeologist.

441
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:03,452
Well, the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident.

442
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,789
And wasn't it the Sultan of Madagascar
who threatened to cut your head off

443
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:08,207
if you ever returned to his country?

444
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,333
No, it wasn't my head.

445
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,709
Then your hands, perhaps.

446
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,795
No, it wasn't my hands,

447
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:13,962
it was my...

448
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:16,632
My misunderstanding.

449
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:19,009
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.

450
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:22,971
I have heard the evil stories
of the Thuggee cult.

451
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:26,308
I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.

452
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:30,062
Later, I learnt
the Thuggee cult was once real

453
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,481
and did of unspeakable things.

454
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:36,568
I am ashamed of what happened here
so many years ago,

455
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:37,986
and I assure you

456
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,157
this will never happen again
in my kingdom.

457
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,910
If I offended you,

458
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,621
then I am sorry.

459
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,509
Dessert!

460
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,524
Chilled monkey brains.

461
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:32,958
I think I'll just check on Willie.

462
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,462
That's all you better do.

463
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:40,716
Tell me later what happened

464
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,468
Am-scray.

465
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:55,063
I've got something for you.

466
00:46:55,564 --> 00:46:59,401
There's nothing you have
that I could possibly want.

467
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:00,944
Right.

468
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:15,792
You're a very nice man.

469
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:18,545
Maybe you could be my palace slave.

470
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,849
Wear your jewels to bed, Princess?

471
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,976
Yeah.

472
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,104
And nothing else.

473
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:38,106
That shock you?

474
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,858
Nothing shocks me.

475
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:42,528
I'm a scientist.

476
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,406
So, as a scientist,
you do a lot of research?

477
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:48,867
Always.

478
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:51,453
And what sort of research
would you do on me?

479
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:56,458
Nocturnal activities.

480
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:59,586
You mean like what sort of cream
I put on my face at night,

481
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,338
what position I like to sleep in?

482
00:48:01,547 --> 00:48:02,881
Mating customs.

483
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:04,007
Love rituals?

484
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:07,010
Primitive sexual practices.

485
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:08,804
So you're an authority in that area?

486
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,556
Years of fieldwork.

487
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,651
I don't blame you for being sore at me.

488
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:25,404
I can be hard to handle.

489
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,115
I've had worse.

490
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,951
But you'll never have better.

491
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:35,622
I don't know.

492
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:37,958
As a scientist,
I don't want to prejudice my experiment.

493
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,710
I'll let you know in the morning.

494
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:43,380
Why, you conceited ape.

495
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:45,716
I'm not that easy.

496
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:49,428
I'm not that easy, either.

497
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:51,555
Trouble with you is, Willie,

498
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,849
you're too used to getting your own way.

499
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:55,934
And you're just too proud to admit

500
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:59,187
that you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones.

501
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:02,733
If you want me, Willie,
you know where you can find me.

502
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:04,776
Five minutes.

503
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,862
You'll be back over here in five minutes.

504
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,488
I'll be asleep in five minutes.

505
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:09,781
Five.

506
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:12,200
You know it, and I know it.

507
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:28,884
Five minutes.

508
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:33,055
Four and a half.

509
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:29,111
"Palace slave."

510
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:31,738
"Nocturnal activities."

511
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:35,283
I'm a "conceited ape"?

512
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,369
"I'll tell you in the morning."

513
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:40,997
I can't believe it.

514
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:42,624
He's not coming.

515
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,710
She's not coming.

516
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:48,505
I can't believe I'm not going.

517
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,318
Indiana Jones!

518
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:13,071
This is one night you'll never forget!

519
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:16,241
This is the night
I slipped right through your fingers!

520
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:19,619
Sleep tight,

521
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:21,371
and pleasant dreams!

522
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,960
I could have been
your greatest adventure.

523
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:38,680
Dr. Jones, your whip!

524
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:01,286
Shorty,

525
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:02,496
turn off the switch.

526
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:10,253
Indy.

527
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:14,341
Be gentle with me.

528
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,140
But I'm here.

529
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,903
There's nobody here.

530
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:37,239
No, I'm here.

531
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,034
Indy, you're acting awfully strange.

532
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:09,896
Hey, I'm right here.

533
00:53:21,992 --> 00:53:26,246
"Follow in the footsteps of Siva."

534
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,248
What does that mean?

535
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:34,629
"Do not betray these truths."

536
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,299
Shorty, go get our stuff.

537
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:08,496
Stay behind me, Short Round.

538
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:13,084
Step where I step,
and don't touch anything.

539
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:27,057
I step where you step.

540
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,100
I touch nothing.

541
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:32,354
Indy!

542
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,751
I step on something.

543
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:58,213
Yeah, there's something on the ground.

544
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,632
Feel like step on fortune cookies.

545
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,427
It's not fortune cookies.

546
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:08,223
Let me take a look.

547
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:23,279
That's no cookies.

548
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:25,740
It's all right. I got him.

549
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:31,037
Go. There, go.

550
00:56:10,994 --> 00:56:12,078
Stop.

551
00:56:12,162 --> 00:56:15,415
Look, just stand up against the wall,
will you?

552
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,557
You say to stand against the wall!

553
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,975
I listen to what you say!

554
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:36,144
- Not my fault! Not my fault!
- Willie, get down here!

555
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,104
We're in trouble!

556
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:41,066
Willie! Willie!

557
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:43,735
Bet I get all dirty again.

558
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:45,737
- Willie, get down here!
- Not my fault!

559
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,905
We're in trouble!

560
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:50,283
Trouble? Trouble? What sort of...

561
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:07,342
This is serious!

562
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:10,804
There are two dead people down here!

563
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:14,140
There're going to be
two dead people in here! Hurry!

564
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:16,392
I've almost had enough of you two.

565
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:17,727
Willie!

566
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:19,521
What's the rush?

567
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:22,816
It's a long story, Willie.
Hurry, or you don't get to hear it.

568
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:27,612
God, what is this?

569
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:31,157
Indy, what is this?

570
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:33,535
I can't see a thing!

571
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:35,453
Hurry!

572
00:57:35,537 --> 00:57:37,163
All right!

573
00:57:37,539 --> 00:57:38,665
I broke a nail.

574
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:54,806
Willie, hurry!

575
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,891
They're in my hair!

576
00:57:56,975 --> 00:57:58,726
Shut up, Willie!

577
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,522
- Indy, let me in!
- No, let us out!

578
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:04,649
- Let me in!
- Let us out!

579
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:06,442
- Shut up!
- I'm down here!

580
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:07,902
They're all over me!

581
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:11,322
There's got to be
a fulcrum release lever somewhere.

582
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:12,407
What?

583
00:58:12,574 --> 00:58:14,409
A handle that opens the door.

584
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:16,327
- Go on!
- They're just, just square holes!

585
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:17,996
Go to the right hole.

586
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:20,707
Hurry, Willie!

587
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:30,592
The other one! The other right.
Your other right!

588
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:33,094
- The one on your right!
- There's slime inside!

589
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,054
I can't do it.

590
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:37,182
You can do it. Feel inside.

591
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:38,600
Okay.

592
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:43,271
You feel inside!

593
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:45,231
Do it now!

594
00:58:45,315 --> 00:58:46,691
Okay!

595
00:58:55,867 --> 00:59:00,455
Willie, we are going to die!

596
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,208
It's soft.

597
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:07,378
It's moving!

598
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:16,596
Got it!

599
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,238
Get 'em off of me! Get 'em off of me!

600
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:36,157
They're all over me! Get 'em off me!

601
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,119
No!

602
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:44,082
It wasn't me! It's her!

603
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:47,252
Come on!

604
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:50,546
Go! Move! Come on, move! Come on!

605
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:53,484
It's a Thuggee ceremony.

606
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:55,069
They're worshipping Kali.

607
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,290
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

608
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:09,584
Nobody's seen this for a hundred years.

609
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:49,392
Kali Ma. Kali Ma...

610
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:51,519
Kali Ma!

611
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:30,016
He's still alive.

612
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:56,602
Kali Ma.

613
01:05:57,955 --> 01:06:01,125
That's the rock
they took from the village.

614
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,711
It's one of the Sankara Stones.

615
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,928
Why they glow like that?

616
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,515
The legend says

617
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:17,850
when the rocks are brought together,

618
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:20,311
the diamonds inside them will glow.

619
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:22,021
Diamonds?

620
01:06:22,104 --> 01:06:23,189
Diamonds.

621
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:24,482
Diamonds!

622
01:06:24,565 --> 01:06:25,608
Diamonds.

623
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,001
Hey, hey.

624
01:06:44,085 --> 01:06:47,838
Look, I want you two
to stay up here and keep quiet.

625
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,256
Shorty, you keep an eye on her.

626
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,050
- Why, where are you going?
- Down there.

627
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:54,178
Down there? Are you crazy?

628
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:57,390
I'm not leaving here without the stones.

629
01:06:57,473 --> 01:07:00,685
You could get killed chasing after
your damn fortune and glory!

630
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:01,769
Maybe.

631
01:07:03,354 --> 01:07:05,272
But not today.

632
01:08:20,473 --> 01:08:22,308
Be careful.

633
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:33,921
Where's he going?

634
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,384
Let me go!

635
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:43,806
Run, Willie! Run!

636
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,276
Dr. Jones!

637
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:22,947
I keep telling you,

638
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:26,075
you listen me more, you live longer.

639
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,535
Please, let me die.

640
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,497
I pray to Siva,

641
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:35,334
"Let me die," but I do not.

642
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:38,754
Now... Now the evil of Kali take me.

643
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:41,590
How?

644
01:11:41,674 --> 01:11:44,468
They will make me drink
the blood of the Kali.

645
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:47,888
Then I'll fall into
the Black Sleep of the Kali Ma.

646
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,348
What is that?

647
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:51,767
We become like them.

648
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:58,107
We'll be alive, but like a nightmare.

649
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:01,694
You drink blood,
you not wake up from nightmare.

650
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:17,418
You were caught trying to steal
the Sankara Stones.

651
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:20,587
There were five stones in the beginning.

652
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:24,341
Over the centuries,
they were dispersed by wars,

653
01:12:24,425 --> 01:12:26,552
sold off by thieves like you.

654
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,512
Thieves like me, huh?

655
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:32,307
Still missing two.

656
01:12:33,017 --> 01:12:35,269
A century ago,
when the British raided this temple

657
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:37,229
and butchered my people,

658
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:41,692
a loyal priest hid the last two stones
down here in the catacombs.

659
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:44,945
So that's what you've got
these slaves digging for, huh?

660
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:46,864
They're innocent children.

661
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:49,700
They dig for the gems
to support our cause.

662
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,829
They also search
for the last two stones.

663
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:59,877
Soon we will have
all the five Sankara Stones,

664
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,838
and the Thuggees will be all powerful.

665
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,091
What a vivid imagination.

666
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:14,224
You don't believe me?

667
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:18,103
You will, Dr. Jones.

668
01:13:20,147 --> 01:13:24,693
You will become a true believer.

669
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,378
Hi.

670
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:09,113
Dr. Jones!

671
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:10,656
Don't drink, it's bad!

672
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:12,741
Don't drink!

673
01:14:12,825 --> 01:14:14,243
Spit it out!

674
01:14:48,152 --> 01:14:49,987
Dr. Jones...

675
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:11,383
You dare not do that.

676
01:15:29,735 --> 01:15:31,612
Leave him alone, you bastards!

677
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:44,541
The British in India will be slaughtered.

678
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:46,877
Then we will overrun the Muslims.

679
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,713
Then the Hebrew God will fall.

680
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:53,467
And then the Christian God
will be cast down and forgotten.

681
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:59,056
Soon, Kali Ma will rule the world.

682
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,481
Dr. Jones...

683
01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:53,754
Kali Ma protects us.

684
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:56,006
We are her children.

685
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:59,343
We pledge our devotion to her

686
01:17:59,426 --> 01:18:01,345
with an offering of flesh...

687
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:03,221
What are you doing?

688
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:08,268
...And blood.

689
01:18:17,277 --> 01:18:21,615
Your friend has seen,
and she has heard.

690
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:25,619
Now she will not talk.

691
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,755
I'm not going to have
anything nice to say

692
01:18:36,838 --> 01:18:38,715
about this place when I get back.

693
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:42,386
Indy! For God sakes, help me!

694
01:18:42,469 --> 01:18:44,763
What's the matter with you?

695
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,531
No, no.

696
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,063
Come.

697
01:19:37,649 --> 01:19:39,151
Come.

698
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:03,550
Indiana...

699
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:08,555
Indiana, help us.

700
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:24,488
Please, snap out of it.

701
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:28,241
You're not one of them.

702
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:32,496
You're not one of them.

703
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,626
Please come back to us.

704
01:20:38,418 --> 01:20:40,420
Don't leave me.

705
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:56,144
No!

706
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,941
What are you doing?

707
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:02,734
Are you mad?

708
01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:22,022
This can't be happening,
this can't be happening.

709
01:22:22,647 --> 01:22:25,734
Wake up, Willie, wake up.

710
01:22:56,848 --> 01:22:59,726
No!No!No!

711
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:13,657
No,no,no!

712
01:23:14,366 --> 01:23:16,701
Wake up, Dr. Jones, wake up!

713
01:23:20,914 --> 01:23:22,707
Dr. Jones!

714
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:39,766
Indy, I love you.

715
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,937
Wake up, Indy! Wake up!

716
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:49,067
You're my best friend! Wake up, Indy!

717
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:56,324
Wait! Wait!

718
01:23:57,117 --> 01:23:58,743
He's mine!

719
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:04,499
I'm all right, kid.

720
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:50,211
Mola Ram!

721
01:26:12,252 --> 01:26:14,170
Give me some slack!

722
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:35,984
Willie, Willie, wake up!

723
01:26:37,986 --> 01:26:40,530
Willie, Willie, it's me! I'm back!

724
01:26:43,241 --> 01:26:45,034
Indy.

725
01:27:12,937 --> 01:27:15,106
Indy, my friend.

726
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:18,151
I'm sorry, kid.

727
01:27:24,866 --> 01:27:27,785
Indy, now, let's get out of here.

728
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,999
Right. All of us.

729
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,116
No!

730
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:05,758
I've got to save him!

731
01:29:05,842 --> 01:29:08,094
- He can take care of himself.
- He needs me.

732
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:12,015
I've got to save Indy!

733
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,779
Okay, save him.

734
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:31,868
Drop him down!

735
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:34,162
I kill you! Drop him down!

736
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:06,986
What's the matter with him?

737
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:52,365
Here. Try this.

738
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:09,108
Go, Indy!

739
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:13,631
It was the Black Sleep of Kali.

740
01:33:26,852 --> 01:33:28,062
Short Round!

741
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:32,358
Quit fooling around with that kid!
Get down in the cart, now!

742
01:33:32,733 --> 01:33:33,943
Okeydokey, Indy!

743
01:33:34,485 --> 01:33:37,363
Please listen.
To get out, you must take the left tunnel.

744
01:33:37,697 --> 01:33:39,073
Thank you.

745
01:34:26,871 --> 01:34:28,331
Shorty! Quit stalling!

746
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:30,583
Come on, Indy!

747
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:31,917
Go!

748
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:33,377
GO! Go!

749
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:38,758
Shorty, look out!

750
01:34:46,307 --> 01:34:47,600
- Come on!
- Indy!

751
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:54,815
Hurry!

752
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:02,031
Hurry! Hurry up!

753
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:11,040
Indy, take the left tunnel! The left tunnel!

754
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:13,876
No, Indy! You missed it! Left tunnel!

755
01:35:44,824 --> 01:35:46,575
We got company!

756
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:52,623
- Stop.
- Let her go!

757
01:35:52,706 --> 01:35:54,500
- Let go of the brake.
- What?

758
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:56,377
- What?
- Let her go.

759
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:57,878
Our only chance is to outrun them.

760
01:36:14,937 --> 01:36:16,063
Shorty?

761
01:36:16,147 --> 01:36:18,149
Come up here and take the brake.

762
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:21,861
Watch it on the curves,
or we'll fly right off the track

763
01:36:21,944 --> 01:36:23,195
Okay.

764
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:46,695
- What are you doing?
- Short cut.

765
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:48,322
- Yes, Indy.
- Short, cut.

766
01:38:12,638 --> 01:38:14,306
Watch it!

767
01:38:18,269 --> 01:38:19,770
Indy, help!

768
01:38:22,898 --> 01:38:24,191
"Hang on!
- Indy!

769
01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:27,486
- Pull him in.
- Let me go! Let me go!

770
01:38:28,862 --> 01:38:30,573
Let go of him!

771
01:38:31,574 --> 01:38:33,951
No! No!

772
01:38:34,034 --> 01:38:35,077
Pull him in!

773
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,245
- I'll catch him!
- No!

774
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:23,542
Duck!

775
01:39:43,854 --> 01:39:44,938
- All right.
- What?

776
01:39:45,022 --> 01:39:46,607
Brakes. Brakes.

777
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:48,651
- Slow us down.
- Okay.

778
01:39:53,906 --> 01:39:56,408
Big mistake. Big mistake, Indy.

779
01:39:56,492 --> 01:39:57,576
Figures.

780
01:40:18,847 --> 01:40:20,349
We're going too fast!

781
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:21,517
Too fast!

782
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:23,185
We're going to crash!

783
01:40:35,781 --> 01:40:37,408
Water, water, water!

784
01:40:37,491 --> 01:40:38,951
- Look! Look there!
- Water!

785
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:41,370
- Fire! You're on fire!
- Water, water!

786
01:40:41,453 --> 01:40:44,373
- Look. ..
- Water, water.

787
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:47,334
Water, water.

788
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:50,129
Come on. Come on!

789
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:05,227
Let's go!

790
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,066
Run, run!

791
01:41:23,829 --> 01:41:25,205
Willie, look out!

792
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:36,467
No!

793
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:39,303
Head for the bridge. Go!

794
01:41:40,596 --> 01:41:42,014
Come on, Willie, this way.

795
01:41:55,402 --> 01:41:56,737
Oh, God.

796
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:01,742
Come on, let's go. Strong bridge.

797
01:42:02,034 --> 01:42:03,869
Look, strong wood.

798
01:42:04,703 --> 01:42:06,038
Come on!

799
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:07,414
Look!

800
01:42:07,664 --> 01:42:09,374
Shorty!

801
01:42:11,835 --> 01:42:13,837
Help! I'm falling down.

802
01:42:16,507 --> 01:42:18,050
Help!

803
01:42:19,927 --> 01:42:21,053
Not very funny.

804
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:47,746
Back!

805
01:43:13,438 --> 01:43:15,274
Welcome.

806
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:29,913
Let her go, Mola Ram.

807
01:43:29,997 --> 01:43:33,959
You are in a position
unsuitable to give orders.

808
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:35,669
Watch your back!

809
01:43:45,012 --> 01:43:46,597
You want the stones, let 'em go.

810
01:43:51,226 --> 01:43:52,603
Let her go!

811
01:43:54,146 --> 01:43:56,732
Drop them, Dr. Jones.

812
01:43:56,815 --> 01:43:59,192
They will be found.

813
01:43:59,276 --> 01:44:01,069
You won't.

814
01:44:04,156 --> 01:44:05,240
Indy!

815
01:44:05,324 --> 01:44:06,909
Behind you!

816
01:44:15,542 --> 01:44:17,669
Oh, shit.

817
01:44:28,263 --> 01:44:29,932
Go on.

818
01:44:31,016 --> 01:44:32,517
Go.

819
01:44:41,652 --> 01:44:43,362
Go on! Go on!

820
01:44:44,446 --> 01:44:46,323
Get moving.

821
01:44:50,077 --> 01:44:52,037
Shorty...

822
01:44:57,584 --> 01:45:00,170
Hang on, lady. We going for a ride.

823
01:45:01,964 --> 01:45:03,799
Oh, my God!

824
01:45:05,634 --> 01:45:09,096
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

825
01:45:09,554 --> 01:45:11,181
Is he nuts?

826
01:45:12,057 --> 01:45:13,517
He no nuts.

827
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,185
He's crazy.

828
01:45:15,519 --> 01:45:20,273
Mola Ram, prepare to meet Kali

829
01:45:20,357 --> 01:45:22,109
in hell.

830
01:45:23,193 --> 01:45:24,319
What are you doing?

831
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:26,238
You fool!

832
01:46:26,465 --> 01:46:28,175
Indy, cover your heart!

833
01:46:28,258 --> 01:46:30,218
Cover your heart!

834
01:46:30,844 --> 01:46:32,554
Oh, my God!

835
01:46:42,481 --> 01:46:43,815
Oh, my God.

836
01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:28,193
- Look out!
- No!

837
01:47:53,718 --> 01:47:55,220
No!

838
01:47:59,683 --> 01:48:01,393
Come on. Let's go!

839
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:04,312
The stones are mine!

840
01:48:05,397 --> 01:48:07,357
You've betrayed Siva.

841
01:48:11,611 --> 01:48:13,196
You betrayed Siva.

842
01:48:22,581 --> 01:48:23,999
You betrayed Siva!

843
01:48:56,114 --> 01:48:58,116
Well, it's about time.

844
01:49:16,301 --> 01:49:17,802
Hold your fire.

845
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:22,594
We know you are coming back

846
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:25,764
when life return to our village.

847
01:51:29,768 --> 01:51:36,274
Now you can see the magic
of the rock you bring back.

848
01:51:36,566 --> 01:51:40,362
Yes, I understand its power now.

849
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:47,619
You could've kept it.

850
01:51:47,702 --> 01:51:49,621
What for?
They'd just put it in a museum.

851
01:51:49,704 --> 01:51:52,123
It'd be another rock collecting dust.

852
01:51:52,207 --> 01:51:55,752
But then it would've given you
your fortune and glory.

853
01:51:55,835 --> 01:51:57,587
Anything could happen.

854
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:59,881
It's a long way to Delhi.

855
01:51:59,964 --> 01:52:01,049
No, thanks.

856
01:52:01,132 --> 01:52:03,385
No more adventures with you,
Dr. Jones.

857
01:52:03,468 --> 01:52:07,055
Sweetheart, after all the fun
we've had together?

858
01:52:08,181 --> 01:52:11,226
If you think I'm going to Delhi with you,
or anyplace else

859
01:52:11,309 --> 01:52:13,311
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into,

860
01:52:13,395 --> 01:52:15,105
think again, buster!

861
01:52:15,188 --> 01:52:17,607
I'm going home to Missouri
where they never feed you snakes,

862
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:20,402
before ripping your heart out
and lowering you into hot pits!

863
01:52:20,485 --> 01:52:23,988
This is not my idea of a swell time!

864
01:52:24,072 --> 01:52:26,950
Excuse me, sir. I need a guide to Delhi.
If you could...

865
01:52:46,845 --> 01:52:48,596
Very funny.

866
01:52:54,519 --> 01:52:56,020
Very funny.
