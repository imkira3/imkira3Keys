2
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,847
Hey, Timmy, get me a hot dog.

3
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,105
Hey, Dave.
I like your Dukes of Hazzard T-shirt.

4
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,648
Well, thanks, Sara.
I like your CHiPs T-shirt.

5
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,082
- Thanks.
- Fun party, huh?

6
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,813
Yeah. Except for Arnie Shankman
being here.

7
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,152
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

8
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,021
I feel bad for him with his sister
losing her mind and all.

9
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,425
Whatever.

10
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,765
You know what we should do?
Play Truth or Dare.

11
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,336
- You want to?
- Sure.

12
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,271
Okay, I'll go first. Truth or dare?

13
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,799
Truth.

14
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,275
Have you ever kissed a girl before?

15
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,039
- Well, I...
- Family doesn't count.

16
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,185
- Maybe I'll take dare.
- Okay.

17
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,351
I dare you to kiss me.

18
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,515
Right here?

19
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,491
Yeah. I want everyone to see
that your first kiss is with me.

20
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,187
Got any mustard for that cocktail frank,
butt-lick?

21
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,428
- David Buznik.
- I just landed in St. Louis.

22
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,132
- I hope you wrote my speech.
- I did, sir. I pulled an all nighter.

23
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,310
I look forward to this, Mr. Head.
Never been to St. Louis.

24
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,242
Thank you for allowing me
to come on this trip...

25
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,542
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that sounds great.

26
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,483
If we finish our work,
I'd love to go to a jazz club.

27
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,645
Terrific.

28
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,917
- He hung up on you again, didn't he?
- Yes. Yes, he did.

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,755
He's a jerk. You came up with the idea
for the Husky Cat clothing line.

30
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,729
He didn't say thank you.
He should give you a promotion.

31
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,926
There's a creative executive position
that just opened up, so....

32
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,266
Bring that up on the trip.
You gotta stick up for yourself.

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,567
I know. I'll figure something out.

34
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,871
I gotta go. Sorry.

35
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,947
I'm gonna miss you.

36
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,779
That guy's looking at us.

37
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,614
You know I don't like it when people
watch me kiss.

38
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,914
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,452
Take care.

40
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,653
Okay. Bye.

41
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,452
Dave....

42
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,800
- Have a good flight.
- Okay.

43
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,803
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,987
I think you're in my seat.

45
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,486
Come on, pal. I'm already settled in
here. Can't you sit somewhere else?

46
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,921
You're supposed to sit in the seat
they assigned you.

47
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,066
Nobody cares. Just sit in the seat
I'm supposed to sit in.

48
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,861
Excuse me. This seat's available.

49
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,433
Okay. Thank you.

50
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,202
You're very welcome.

51
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,812
No air.

52
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,376
That's too bad, huh?

53
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,063
You're on my side of the armrest.

54
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,396
We're not gonna have problems, are we?

55
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,060
No.

56
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,106
I'm wetting my Jockeys here.

57
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,172
You gotta get a load of this, keed.

58
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,181
I mean, you like comedies?

59
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,755
I just haven't been sleeping a lot
lately so I was trying to catch some....

60
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,588
Look at this actress here.

61
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,433
What is your position
on breast implants?

62
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,294
This guy.

63
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,998
I can just watch the movie with you.

64
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,132
Excuse me.

65
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,506
- Could I get a headset?
- Certainly.

66
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:21,905
Thank you.

67
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,386
Probably make out
with my next boyfriend.

68
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,889
Oh, my God, it was disgusting.

69
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,119
Miss?

70
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,361
I'll be right there, sir.

71
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,258
Where's your headset?

72
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,803
She's busy right now, but it's coming.

73
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,705
For crying out loud. You're missing
important plot points.

74
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,240
Ma'am?

75
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,506
Could you give me a second, sir?

76
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,221
Excuse me.

77
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,756
Could I maybe get that headset,
please?

78
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,526
- Do not raise your voice to me, sir.
- I wasn't raising my voice.

79
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,759
Just calm down.

80
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,801
I am calm. I just want my headset.

81
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,599
Our country is going through
a difficult time now.

82
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,298
If you won't cooperate...

83
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,535
I don't know where a headset
ties into patriotism.

84
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,736
Is there a problem here, sir?

85
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,976
I don't think so.

86
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,119
Can you come to the back with me
so we can have a talk?

87
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,380
A talk about what? There's not a
problem.

88
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,184
- The stewardess just keeps...
- Flight attendant.

89
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,756
The flight attendant keeps
ignoring me when...

90
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,952
Calm down.

91
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,097
I am calm.
What is it with you people?

92
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,893
"You people"?

93
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,665
Now wait a minute.

94
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,429
I don't mean you people.
I mean you people.

95
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,437
I will not tolerate any racist
behavior on the plane.

96
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,768
This is a difficult time
for our country.

97
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,605
I'm not a racist.
I just want to watch the movie.

98
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,374
I'm only going to say this
one more time, sir. Calm down.

99
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,607
I'm calm!

100
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,591
All rise.

101
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,761
- What do you think?
- Not guilty. It's a no-brainer.

102
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:26,428
Mr. Buznik. In case 723, assault and
battery against a flight attendant...

103
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,332
...I find you guilty.

104
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:34,007
I'm ordering you to pay a fine
of $3500.

105
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,340
Thank God you're okay.

106
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,348
In addition, to prevent
further acts of rage...

107
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,615
...this court orders you to undergo 20
hours of anger management therapy.

108
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,449
Anger management?

109
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,637
Oh, my goodness. Bobby Knight.

110
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,806
- You're in this group?
- Oh, yeah. This is my first day.

111
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,434
- It's my first day also.
- I hope this class cures me.

112
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,274
Working on the anger problem?

113
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,682
Anger? Isn't this
Sexaholics Anonymous?

114
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,078
No. I think that's down the hall.

115
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,419
Well, the hell with this!
I'm going home!

116
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,111
Dr. Rydell?

117
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,714
You don't remember me, do you?

118
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:55,388
- I sat next to you on the plane.
- Oh, yeah, the headset guy.

119
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,653
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

120
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,059
That was a crazy flight.

121
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,861
They actually sentenced me
to anger management for that.

122
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,196
Really?

123
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,871
Wow.

124
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,564
This is incredible.
You could sign this for me...

125
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,734
...and tell them I don't have
an anger problem if you want.

126
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,972
I can't just sign your papers.

127
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,344
I didn't do anything wrong.
You know that.

128
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,213
All right.

129
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,018
How's this?

130
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,624
Just hang for one session...

131
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,387
...so I can at least say
I gave you a proper analysis.

132
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,555
- Then I'll sign your papers.
- Okay.

133
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,628
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

134
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:37,970
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

135
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,770
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

136
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,205
And I was like, you know,
"Don't go there."

137
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,140
But he kept on about wanting to see
a doctor's note or something.

138
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,045
And I said, "Look, I'm seriously
serious. You don't want to go there."

139
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,651
But he kept talking and talking,
being such a nag...

140
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,221
...and then I just blacked out.

141
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,551
I blacked out.

142
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,320
And when I woke up, I was standing
over him and I was screaming:

143
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:08,229
"I told you not to go there!
I told you not to go there!"

144
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,367
How do you feel you
handled that situation?

145
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,264
Not as well as I could've.

146
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:20,708
Remember, Lou, temper's the one
thing you can't get rid of by losing it.

147
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,378
Now, Fury Fighters, let's say hello
to someone...

148
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:30,716
...who's joining our quest to get
the anger monkeys off our backs:

149
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,983
- Dave.
- Hi, Dave.

150
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,148
Hi.

151
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:38,523
Good news, I fed my anger monkey
a banana this morning...

152
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,290
...and he's feeling much better.

153
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,338
More good news, you won't have to
listen to those lame jokes...

154
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,530
...because I'm only here
for one session.

155
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,974
Dave assaulted a female
flight attendant in midair.

156
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,544
- Nice.
- I bet you beat her good.

157
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,179
I didn't beat anybody.
I touched a woman.

158
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,377
Liar. Bullshitter.
You're a woman beater.

159
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,422
You can't admit it because you're
a piece of garbage.

160
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,994
I don't know about all that,
but now I understand why you're here.

161
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,061
I'm here because I was verbally
attacked by my neighbor.

162
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,701
And I took a dump on his porch.

163
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,630
I guess you're better than me.
That's why you can't cop to your rage.

164
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,433
You're superior. He's superior.

165
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,601
- Maybe Dave's not ready yet, Chuck.
- You're not ready. Hear what he said?

166
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,280
Let's introduce Dave
to some of the rest of us.

167
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,281
Girls, why don't you tell Dave
what brought you here.

168
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:36,251
I'm sure he'd love to listen
to what you guys have to say.

169
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,855
We always do.

170
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,426
- Come on, Dave. Join us.
- Okay.

171
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,360
Okay. Well, we're
in the adult film industry.

172
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,693
And we're lovers.

173
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,837
One day, Gina was having sex
with this Filipino guy Melo...

174
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,064
- ...which was cool, it was in the script.
- Sure.

175
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,732
And then I asked Melo
back to the house with us...

176
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,346
...which is cool, because,
well, we like a little variety.

177
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,237
Variety's good.

178
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,042
So anyway, in the middle
of our session...

179
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,187
...I look up and I see Gina
kissing Melo on the mouth...

180
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,916
...which is not cool because it
violates our threesome code of ethics.

181
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,424
- Stacy bit my toe off.
- Then Melo freaks out...

182
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:19,128
- ...and calls me a crazy skank.
- Nobody talks to my bitch that way.

183
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,493
- So I stapled his lips shut.
- Here we are.

184
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,693
Well, we've all been there.

185
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,940
- I like him.
- Yeah, he's funny.

186
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,574
Not as funny as you.

187
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,708
I like that.

188
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,241
- All right, girls.
- Let it go. Let it go a little bit longer.

189
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,709
Walk it off.

190
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,554
Nate. Didn't we decide that you
shouldn't listen to the ball game?

191
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:53,220
Don't worry, Dr. B, it's just a regular
season game. Not important.

192
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,128
He missed the lay-up!

193
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,599
See? Iverson just missed a lay-up
at the buzzer, Sixers lose.

194
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,238
Who gives a crap, huh?

195
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,670
I mean, it's just a silly game, anyways.

196
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,405
The anger sharks are swimming
in my head.

197
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,340
You gotta dunk that shit!

198
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,679
You gotta dunk that shit!

199
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,719
Listen to me. Stay with me, Nate.

200
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,854
Now, repeat after me, Nate:

201
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,254
Goosfraba.

202
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,292
Goos blah blah.

203
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,953
Not "blah blah," Nate.

204
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,664
Goosfraba.

205
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,428
Goosfraba.

206
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,333
That's good. Slower.

207
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,236
Goosfraba.

208
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,569
How do you feel?

209
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,167
Better.

210
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,438
Good job, Nate.

211
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,279
That sound is a derivation
of an old Eskimo word...

212
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,819
...that mothers used to calm
their children.

213
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,048
- I see.
- Eskimos seem nice.

214
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,022
- They do.
- I think Eskimos are smug.

215
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,627
Hold that thought, Chuck.

216
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,821
So, Dave...

217
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,831
...tell us about yourself.

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,989
Who are you?

219
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,369
Well, I am an executive assistant...

220
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,869
...at a major pet products company.

221
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,008
I don't want you to tell us what you do.
I want you to tell us who you are.

222
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,113
All right.

223
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,312
I'm a pretty good guy.

224
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,377
I like playing tennis on occasion....

225
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,817
Also, not your hobbies, Dave,
just simple:

226
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,514
Tell us who you are.

227
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,158
I just....

228
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,526
Maybe you could give me an example
of what a good answer would be.

229
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,826
What did you say?

230
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,302
You want Lou to tell you who you are?

231
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,234
No, I just....

232
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,477
I'm a nice, easygoing man.

233
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,906
I might be a little bit
indecisive at times.

234
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,451
Dave, you're describing
your personality.

235
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,952
I want to know...

236
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,884
- ...who you are.
- What the hell do you want me to say?

237
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,656
I mean, I'm sorry. I just....
I want to answer your question.

238
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,929
I'm just not doing it right, I guess.

239
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,905
I think we're getting a picture, Dave.

240
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,011
- Let's move on.
- Dr. Rydell, I'd like to know something.

241
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,340
Why is it that Chuck
thinks he can smoke?

242
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,109
I do whatever I want when I want,
you little Spanish fruit topping.

243
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,151
Honey, at least I didn't
make my aunt pregnant.

244
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,956
What are you laughing at, Dave?

245
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,793
Just laughing. I don't know.
I'm not laughing at you.

246
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,162
Were you laughing with me?
Because I'm not laughing.

247
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,501
Am I out of line,
or is this guy pushing me?

248
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,240
Well, how do you feel, Chuck?

249
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,468
I went from happy to angry, skipped
sad. Now I feel like kicking his ass.

250
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,370
Then we'll see who's laughing.

251
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,983
What? Think you're better than me
because you've got both your nuts?

252
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,415
All right, man. All right. Come on.
Come on, big boy. Pretty boy.

253
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,190
All right. Is it worth going back
to the penitentiary, Chuck?

254
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,592
- So he's laughing at you.
- I'm not laughing at him.

255
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,068
Goosfraba.

256
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,176
- Goosfraba.
- Okay.

257
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,973
Good job, Chuck.
That was really good.

258
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,183
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

259
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:34,618
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

260
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,551
I haven't been to the Actors Studio
in quite some time.

261
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,623
- I'm sure your audition will go well.
- Thanks. I hope so.

262
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,987
- Good night.
- All right.

263
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,423
- Thanks, Buddy.
- Bye-bye.

264
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,790
That was a little bit insane.

265
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,228
If I had to do 20 hours of that,
I'd end up killing myself.

266
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,390
Here you go.

267
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,537
Twenty hours in my class
would be pointless for you.

268
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,964
I agree.

269
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,699
I think I'm going to recommend
to the court that we double your time.

270
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,539
What do you mean?

271
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,270
Let me explain something.

272
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,243
There are two kinds of angry people:
explosive and implosive.

273
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:10,452
Explosive is the kind of individual that
you see screaming at the cashier...

274
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,487
...for not taking their coupons.

275
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:17,421
Implosive is the cashier
who remains quiet, day after day...

276
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:21,087
...and finally shoots everyone
in the store.

277
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,858
You're the cashier.

278
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:27,970
No. I'm the guy hiding in the frozen
food section dialing 911, I swear.

279
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,265
I'm going to assign you an anger ally...

280
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,967
...to help calm you down
when you're losing it.

281
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,234
Chuck.

282
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,243
Not Chuck. Give me Bobby Knight,
or the porno girls.

283
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,213
Heard we're partnering up, huh?

284
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,008
- Yes.
- Here's my number.

285
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,745
Great. "You're going to die, bitch."

286
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,818
Oops, that's a letter I'm writing
to Geraldo Rivera.

287
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,583
- I see.
- My bad. Here.

288
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,159
That's the number. Good. Thank you.

289
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,726
Dave and Chuck...

290
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,200
...working together as a team.

291
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,903
- It's a win-win situation.
- Yeah, feels it.

292
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,908
Dave's particulars.

293
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,969
I'll see you soon.

294
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,749
The Yanks are great this season.

295
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,358
Dave thinks they could beat Seattle's
win record.

296
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,926
Remember at Brown when we
saw Ron Guidry win his 20th?

297
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,927
Oh, man. He was on fire that year.

298
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,258
We could've been too.

299
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,732
Andrew, don't start or I can't
hang out with you anymore.

300
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,998
Sorry, it's just hard. I'll never meet
anyone as good as you.

301
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,867
You will. She'll be a very lucky lady.

302
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,637
Thanks for being my best friend.

303
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,708
Linda.

304
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,043
- Hey, Dave.
- Andrew.

305
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,809
Good to see you guys hugging.

306
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,588
How was the doctor?

307
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,756
Psychotic.

308
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,552
Well, did you get any good
promotion news from Mr. Head?

309
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,663
I wasn't able to talk to him
about that yet, but I will.

310
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,996
Not that crowded here.
You'd think it would be packed.

311
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:08,299
I rented the place. I figured it'd be
more fun if it was just Brown alumni.

312
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,805
Where'd you go to college again?

313
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,671
Trenton Community College.

314
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,077
You had a hard day.
Let me buy you a milk shake.

315
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,976
Later, Andrew.

316
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,313
... once you cast your line in,
so during retrieval...

317
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,423
...it'll help you to create a realistic
and a erratic....

318
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,019
Hey, Dave.

319
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,925
- Hey. Andrew, what's up?
- Not much.

320
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,699
You always try to simulate live bait.

321
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:41,429
Okay, they got fishing while you
go to the bathroom. That's nice.

322
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,801
Yep. Bass fishing.
Hey, he caught one.

323
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,373
Be aware of your presentation...

324
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,276
...and make sure that,
as you work it along....

325
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:51,775
Oh, yeah.

326
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,018
Congratulations.

327
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,884
Now that is a big one, folks.

328
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,728
Always a blast being with your friends.

329
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,365
It was a great night.

330
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,524
Yankees winning, beer and hot dogs.

331
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,862
Yeah, you like those foot-long
hot dogs, don't you?

332
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,807
So I saw your boy Andrew
at the urinal.

333
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,644
Saw his...

334
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,509
- ...thing.
- You were looking?

335
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,479
Yeah, unfortunately.

336
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:31,212
So, now, did this guy grow up near
a nuclear power plant or something?

337
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,114
What are you talking about?

338
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,695
Never really seen nothing like that
before. Didn't it used to scare you?

339
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:38,852
I never saw it.

340
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,856
You never saw it?

341
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,625
No, I told you, I never slept with him.
Why, is it huge?

342
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,033
No. No. No. No.

343
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,697
It's actually quite petite.

344
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,910
I felt bad for him.

345
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,745
It looked like it belonged on a baby
and it had a funny color.

346
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,577
I bet he got a lot of snickers
in the locker room.

347
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,753
Like, "What the hell's that thing?"

348
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,254
When you're in a locker room,
you must feel good about yourself.

349
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:11,226
I do. If there are 20 naked guys
in there, I'm usually in the top 18.

350
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,998
- Which isn't bad.
- You're doing really good.

351
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,497
Thanks.

352
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,072
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Let me get rid of them.

353
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,904
- Hello?
- Dave, it's me, Chuck.

354
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,643
- Who's Chuck?
- Your anger ally.

355
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,681
I'm in a mood, Dave. A bad mood.

356
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,283
A very bad mood.

357
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,980
I was fired from my ice-cream truck job
today. No more Fudgeicles.

358
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,922
- What's an anger ally?
- Who's that?

359
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,317
She making fun of me?

360
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,623
No. That's my girlfriend.

361
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:49,927
You tell her to put a sock in it because
I need to talk to you right now!

362
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,333
We're a little busy right now.

363
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,596
You're busy? We're all busy, okay?

364
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:58,431
You come down here before
a black wolf swallows my brain!

365
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,487
After I got kicked out of the Army,
I went through a real bad time:

366
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:16,218
Hookers, booze, shooting holes in the
ceiling, screaming myself to sleep.

367
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,395
Finally, my parents said I
had to move out.

368
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,463
I'm guessing that's when you decided
to shack up with your aunt.

369
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,766
Don't get cute, wiseass!

370
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,495
But, yes.

371
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,199
What's with the watch, huh?
Am I boring you?

372
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:36,245
We ordered the drinks 15 minutes ago
and I kind of gotta get back.

373
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,415
Miss? Excuse me, miss?

374
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,415
Is this Slow And Stupid Waitress Day?

375
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,679
I'm sorry. I be right with you.

376
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,320
Damn, man, reminds me
of these chicks back in the war.

377
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,393
Would give you the old licky-licky,
then fry your banana.

378
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,584
Settle.

379
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:56,223
I have seen some shit, man.
I kid you not, I have seen some shit.

380
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:01,404
Wake up to the sound
of kids screaming.

381
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,570
Explosions everywhere.

382
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,775
Never know when your number's up.

383
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,707
Vietnam, huh?

384
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,815
- Grenada, man.
- Grenada?

385
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,916
Wasn't that like 12 hours long?

386
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,714
Did you see that?

387
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,993
- See what?
- That guy. He just gave me a look.

388
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,996
He didn't give you a look.

389
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:33,170
And I'm pretty sure I heard him mutter
some kind of anti-Semitic remark.

390
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,634
Are you Jewish?

391
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,573
I could be. But, no. Half Irish,
half Italian, half Mexican.

392
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,304
Let's go give those guys some tsuris.

393
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,474
Well, the guy on the left is blind,
Chuck.

394
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,480
I hear you.

395
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,909
He's yours.

396
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,085
No. That's not what I was saying.

397
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,649
- Hey.
- What the hell?

398
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,487
Got something against guys with hair?

399
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,650
What's going on?

400
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,461
Don't! Stop it! Stop!

401
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,764
Stop! Goosfraba!

402
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:08,928
You piece of shit!

403
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,849
Stop it! Stop it!

404
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,288
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

405
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,587
I see you've managed to brutalize
a cocktail waitress this time.

406
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,652
I guess beating up stewardesses
can get old after a while.

407
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,957
Flight attendant, Your Honor.

408
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,259
I didn't hit her on purpose,
Your Honor.

409
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,495
I was being attacked by someone...

410
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,299
...and while I was
trying to take away his....

411
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:44,941
His....

412
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,805
Trying to take away my cane,
Your Honor.

413
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,112
You cracked a waitress in the face...

414
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,979
...while attempting to steal
a blind man's cane?

415
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:59,150
Your Honor, we're not even sure
how blind this man really is.

416
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,691
Okay. My bad. Moving on.

417
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,126
Happy now, ass-wipe?

418
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,733
Mr. Buznik, I don't know
why you hate women.

419
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,633
Maybe you don't know either...

420
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,834
...but I'll let you think about it while
you spend one year in a state prison.

421
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,513
- Isn't that a bit harsh, Your Honor?
- No!

422
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,171
Okay.

423
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:32,316
- May I approach, Your Honor?
- By all means, Dr. Rydell.

424
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,514
Thank you.

425
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,162
- It's been a while.
- Yes, it has.

426
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,999
- You look marvelous, Brenda.
- Thank you.

427
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,868
- And how are the boys?
- Fantastic.

428
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,942
James made the basketball team,
Raheem landed the lead...

429
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,601
...in Fiddler on the Roof.

430
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,374
Raheem will make
a breathtaking Tevye, I'm sure.

431
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,918
So do you have a take
on this Buznik guy?

432
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,850
Is this good or bad?

433
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,017
Well, it's bad that he's
talking to her...

434
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,853
...but it's good that....

435
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,858
No, it's bad. It's all bad.

436
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,757
- You think you can help him?
- I think so, Your Honor.

437
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:23,030
If I can't, I'll tear him apart
with my bare hands.

438
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:31,906
Mr. Buznik...

439
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,575
...because of the enormous respect
I have for Dr. Rydell...

440
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,723
...I'm placing you in his intensive
anger management program...

441
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,221
...for 30 days.

442
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:44,652
But if you fail to strictly adhere
to the rules of his program...

443
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,764
...you will spend the next year
in state prison.

444
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,537
- Buddy?
- Good evening. Ready to get it on?

445
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,342
Get what on?
What are you doing here?

446
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,950
Well, well, well.

447
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,483
The lair of the rage rhino.

448
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,622
I smell the effluvium
of pain and frustration.

449
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,018
- Where should we put my stuff?
- What stuff?

450
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,917
We've got 30 days
to control your anger.

451
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,688
My approach dictates
intense observation.

452
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,764
What better vantage point
than bunkmates?

453
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,662
Put that there, Dan,
thank you very much.

454
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,103
No. No. I'm sorry. Guys, I don't think
you should be moving in with me.

455
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,502
Sit down, Dave.

456
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,846
Let's be perfectly clear about this.

457
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,309
You've been deemed
a threat to society.

458
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,849
I believe that radical,
round-the-clock therapy...

459
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,114
...is the only way to effect
a meaningful and positive change...

460
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,348
...in your behavior.

461
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,650
Now we can do it here
or Rikers Island.

462
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,158
- Anything else, Dr. B?
- No thanks, Dan.

463
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,694
We'll install the wiretaps tomorrow.

464
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,887
Wiretaps?

465
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,567
- Is this your CD collection?
- Yes.

466
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,732
Oh, my.

467
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,197
What are you doing?

468
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,571
I don't want you listening
to any angry music.

469
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,542
The Carpenters are angry?
I mean....

470
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,205
Don't be naive, Dave.

471
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,541
"Close to You."
"We've Only Just Begun."

472
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,483
Songs of madness and obsession.

473
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,486
Who's going to pay for that?

474
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:25,652
Retard your anger level a few notches
and listen to me. Can you do that?

475
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,862
Yeah. It's retarded. I'm retarded.

476
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,061
Good.

477
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:34,899
Now then, we need to go over
some ground rules.

478
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,835
My girlfriend got me that.

479
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,977
You're to refrain from violent acts
including verbal assault...

480
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,583
...and vulgar hand gestures.

481
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,515
You may not use rage-enhancing
substances...

482
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:53,418
...such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol,
crack cocaine...

483
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,219
...Slippy-Flippies, Jelly Stingers,
Trick Sticks...

484
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,191
...Bing Bangs or Flying Willards.

485
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,092
- How about Fiddle Faddles?
- Under my supervision.

486
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,296
Also, if you are unable
to stop masturbating...

487
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,927
...please do so without the use
of any pornographic images...

488
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,768
...depicting quote-unquote
"angry sex."

489
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,434
That having been said,
I'm a pretty good guy...

490
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,581
...and I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised...

491
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,649
...at how much fun we can have.

492
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:24,187
Jeez, without Slippy-Flippies or angry
masturbating? How is that possible?

493
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:28,553
Sarcasm is anger's ugly cousin.
From now on, unacceptable.

494
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,325
Dave, I got this for you.

495
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,088
It's a wonderfully therapeutic tool.

496
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,097
Record your thoughts on this
whenever you feel angry.

497
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,633
I'm feeling very angry right now...

498
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,899
...because I only have one bed
and no couch.

499
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,473
Not a problem.

500
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:53,248
In Europe, it's not considered unusual
for three or four men to share a bed.

501
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,918
Yeah, well, that's why I'm
proud to be an American.

502
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,588
By the way....

503
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,424
I like to sleep in the nude.

504
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,596
You hear that frog?

505
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,294
Nope.

506
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,146
What do you want?

507
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,156
I'm just recording your demeanor
upon awakening.

508
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,331
Good to see you got your underwear
back on.

509
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,091
6:30?

510
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,199
I don't gotta be up till 7.

511
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,166
You've got to make my breakfast.

512
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,502
Dave, cooking is very relaxing
and therapeutic.

513
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:28,410
I want two eggs,
over easy and unfertilized...

514
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,945
...wheat toast, dry, and please...

515
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,776
...tell me you've got ketchup.

516
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,042
There's a Denny's down the street.

517
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,618
Not only do they have ketchup...

518
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,348
...but they got the angriest waitresses
I've seen.

519
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,857
You could have a blast with
the goosfraba thing down there.

520
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,218
Lame-o.

521
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,509
Your eggs.

522
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:20,057
- Holy shit!
- I said over easy!!

523
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,801
Now, why did I do that?

524
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,397
Because I refused to spoon with you
last night?

525
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:36,144
The angry man opens his mouth
and shuts his eyes.

526
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,977
Alpha-Bits.

527
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,516
No matter how old I get,
always a culinary delight.

528
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:47,282
No explanation for the egg throwing.
He's a psycho.

529
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:51,125
Don't sulk, Dave. Eat. Sit down.

530
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,260
We'll be off to work in a jiffy.

531
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:59,266
"We'll be off to work." Now, by "we'll,"
I assume you mean just me, right?

532
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,962
Well, I have to join you at work.

533
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,435
Full contact.

534
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:07,467
That will make me look nuts, Buddy,
bringing a shrink to work...

535
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,976
...you whipping eggs at people.
I don't know.

536
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:14,207
You must never be ashamed that you
sought help for yourself, Dave.

537
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,977
It's not a weakness.

538
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,723
I mean, I gotta be there by 9:00.

539
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,985
I don't think we'll make it on time.
You're not even dressed.

540
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,154
The Talmud says:
"Wherever you look...

541
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,157
...there's something to be seen."

542
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,332
Look, Dave.

543
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,516
- What exactly was that all about?
- What?

544
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:51,348
You just ran through a red light.
Are you trying to get us both killed?

545
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:55,356
I'm a little flustered right now.
I have to be to work in eight minutes.

546
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,949
Flustered?

547
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,999
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man!

548
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,169
- Holy shit! What are you doing?
- I need you to unfluster.

549
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,936
My boss is going to go nuts on me
if we're late, so please?

550
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,475
We will proceed when you are centered.

551
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,009
I'm centered, I'm centered.

552
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,012
There's 10,000 people behind us.
Let's go, crazy man.

553
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,245
What is that? Is that good?

554
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,246
We're going to sing a song.

555
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,524
No. I don't want to sing a song.
I want to go to.... I've gotta go.

556
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:30,853
Here we go.

557
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:34,759
The magic of Leonard Bernstein
and Stephen Sondheim's...

558
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,560
...West Side Story.

559
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,795
"I Feel Pretty."

560
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,204
Get this moving.
What the hell's your problem?

561
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,935
Shut your pie-hole!
We're working here!

562
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,606
Wow. Sorry.

563
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,170
Move your ass, dipshit!

564
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,143
Burn in hell!

565
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,593
Yes!

566
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,339
You feel stunning.

567
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,337
And entrancing.

568
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,457
You're late.

569
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:48,098
Yes. There was a little bit
of a tie up on the bridge.

570
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,258
I didn't ask for a traffic report.
You're always late.

571
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,871
Now is the first time I've been late.
But you're right. I'm sorry.

572
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,267
May I interject?

573
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,099
You were about to say something else
before you said, "I'm sorry."

574
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,269
We mustn't absorb and repress.

575
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:06,246
- Who's this?
- I'm his anger management therapist.

576
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,682
You're in anger management?

577
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,621
Temporarily, yeah.

578
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,017
Do you remember the flight
to St. Louis...

579
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,492
...that I was on when they had to
turn the plane around?

580
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:22,462
Yeah, yeah. Because of that unruly
passenger in coach.

581
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,123
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

582
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,566
He doesn't like people
touching his clubs.

583
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,765
Well, that unruly passenger was me.

584
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:36,436
I got arrested at Kennedy. That's why
I didn't make the next flight.

585
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,276
You said your apartment caught fire.

586
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,647
Dissembling is a common tool
of the anger junkie.

587
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,416
Might I have your first name,
Mr. Head? And tell me it isn't Dick.

588
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,822
- It's Frank.
- Fran.

589
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,826
Isn't that normally a girl's name?

590
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,258
What went on on that flight?

591
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,603
To be honest with you,
it was a mix-up. I....

592
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,204
Jibber jabber. Jibber jabbering.
Mumbo jumbo.

593
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,865
Denial. Key, key, key, key, key, key.

594
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:09,342
Fran, your assistant beat the bejesus
out of a flight attendant.

595
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,208
- I didn't.
- You broke her nose.

596
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,441
I broke the cocktail waitress's nose.

597
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,547
I mean, I accidentally did that.

598
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,747
Dave, you have a disease.

599
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:23,690
Would you apologize if you
were a diabetic? Of course not.

600
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,957
Why do you feel you have to apologize
because you're suffering from T.A.S.?

601
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,022
T.A.S.?

602
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,896
Toxic Anger Syndrome.

603
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,736
I don't have T.A.S.

604
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,033
He's angry. It's a sickness,
not a crime, Fran.

605
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,733
His name is Frank!

606
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,315
No. I'm sorry.

607
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,256
Clothes for cats
isn't really a new idea...

608
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:05,095
...but there was never really a line
made for overweight cats...

609
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,204
...who might feel a little
self-conscious...

610
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,465
...about how they look
in certain outfits.

611
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,906
That's why I got the baggy sweater
on him, to cover up his gut.

612
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,911
And the beret to take attention
off his plump head.

613
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,074
Oh, little Meatball.
You tie this up tight...

614
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,584
...and away goes the chin.

615
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,483
I'm so handsome.

616
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:32,459
- Hey, Dave. This is your office?
- Andrew.

617
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,224
- What are you doing here?
- I played golf with Frank.

618
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,898
He's friends with my dad. We're
members of the same country club.

619
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,095
Really? I've been wanting to play golf
with him a long time.

620
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,241
- Is it awesome there?
- It's nice.

621
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,276
So, anyway, Dave, how's
anger management going?

622
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,649
Who told you about that?

623
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,413
Linda's my best friend.
There's no secrets between us.

624
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:01,217
For the love of Mike!
This guy's your girl's best friend?

625
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,292
No. I mean, I like to consider myself
her best friend...

626
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:09,296
...but Andrew is her best friend friend,
if that makes any sense.

627
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,595
You ought to golf yourself.
You look a little stressed out.

628
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,162
I gotta go. Bye.

629
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,676
Well, well, well.

630
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,209
This guy's got quite a basket on him.

631
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,508
Really? I didn't notice that.

632
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,342
Do you really want the love of your life
hanging around with a guy...

633
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:34,082
...who looks as though he could satisfy
a blue whale?

634
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,584
Well, it's....
I'm doing okay myself, pal.

635
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,396
Maybe it's the way his pants fit him.

636
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,425
What's up?

637
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,496
- This is your young lady?
- That's my Linda.

638
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,764
My, oh, my.

639
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,277
I was toying with the notion
that you were gay...

640
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,811
...because of the kitty-cat clothes,
so forth.

641
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:58,975
What does she do?

642
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:03,351
She teaches poetry. Poetry teacher.

643
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,518
I love poetry.

644
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,355
Oh, my, my, my. It's....

645
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,523
Yes, it's a good picture of her.

646
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:20,533
Well, apparently Dr. Rydell has a
history of unorthodox techniques.

647
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,535
He's got a dozen lawsuits pending.

648
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,266
So it's not just me.
This guy is nuts, isn't he?

649
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,466
Or a genius.

650
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:32,105
But if you could prove that he's nuts:
audiotape, video, picture, whatever...

651
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,841
...I'll arrange a hearing.

652
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,184
I gotta go. I think he's coming.

653
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,458
Hi, Nancy.

654
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,531
What are you doing
in the ladies' room?

655
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:54,298
Sorry. I just heard you guys
got cleaner seats than us.

656
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,964
Not after I get through with them.

657
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:04,204
I don't care for the way you've
ironed my shirts, Dave. Try it again.

658
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:08,442
- I've been very patient with you.
- Beware the fury of the patient man.

659
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,213
- I'm serious!
- Too serious.

660
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,912
Get undressed.

661
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,151
What did you say?

662
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,652
Take off your clothes.

663
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:20,388
I've got a stress-reduction technique
to show you.

664
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,499
- It'll be good for you.
- Take off my clothes?

665
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,897
Do you want to see me naked, Buddy?

666
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,000
Are you a homophobe, Dave?

667
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:35,339
No, I'm a pulling-my-penis-out-
in-front-of-you-a-phobe.

668
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,314
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

669
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,759
- What's up, baby?
- Why are we here?

670
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,297
I'm not a homophobe.

671
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,231
My lawyer's gay. His boyfriend is gay.

672
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,894
And are they all aware
that you despise them?

673
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,398
Looking for company, baby?

674
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,406
No. We're not. Thank you.

675
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,238
It's worth 50 bucks...

676
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:13,179
...if you get in the back seat with
my friend here and have a little chat.

677
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,079
My pleasure, Mr. Eyebrows.

678
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,916
Oh, boy, here we go.

679
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,586
- Hello.
- Hey. Good to see you.

680
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,655
- What's your name, baby?
- Melvin.

681
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,426
His name is David. Don't dissemble.

682
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:35,003
I'm not dissembling.
That's my Hebrew name.

683
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,505
I'm Galaxia. That's my German name.

684
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,006
Great.

685
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,408
Where are you from originally,
Hebrew Melvin?

686
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,672
Brooklyn.

687
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,242
What part of Germany do you hail from?

688
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:53,015
I'm from a little Bavarian village
called Lickin Zee Dickin.

689
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,214
Care to visit?

690
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:58,889
Actually, I like to spend
most of my time...

691
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,463
...in Girls Without Wieners-ville.

692
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,799
I'm more comfortable there.

693
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,131
He's just not used to male intimacy.

694
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,603
Well, that's okay, because I'm a lady.

695
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,309
Oops, no, I'm not.

696
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,502
Whoa! There it is.

697
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,245
I feel like dancing. Dancing.

698
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,040
Oh, my God.

699
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,315
What does this have to do
with anger management?

700
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:29,084
- Oh, are you an angry boy?
- No.

701
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,817
Do you need some discipline?

702
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,222
No, thank you very...

703
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,489
Oh! Hey! Hey, watch that shit!

704
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,997
Listen, ladies! Gentleman! Lentleman!

705
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:41,296
I'm not having sex with a she-male!
Relax!

706
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,963
Galaxia, you may
get out of the car now.

707
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,735
Your services are no longer required.

708
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,407
You know what?

709
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,508
You guys are freaks.

710
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,809
Give me the tape recorder.

711
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,582
Come on.

712
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,759
Patient number 135, David Buznik...

713
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,694
...has learned the difference between
unhealthy anger and righteous anger.

714
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:13,394
Thus he has advanced
to the second level of my program.

715
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,004
Great. Can I go throw up now?

716
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,809
I'm a lady. Oops, no, I'm not.

717
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,711
- Whoa, there it is.
- I feel like dancing.

718
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,113
Wasn't that sick?
She looked like Olivia Newton-John...

719
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,121
...if she was really ugly
and had huge balls.

720
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,953
But Buddy didn't order you
to have sex.

721
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,958
I'm getting a call. Please hang on.

722
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,794
- Hello?
- Is Buddy there?

723
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,626
No, he's in the shower right now.

724
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,462
This is Becky, his assistant.

725
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,798
Just tell him his mom called
from Boston.

726
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,998
She said she's having
some minor surgery.

727
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:57,375
It's not serious, but she'll be at Boston
County Hospital for the next two days.

728
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:13,856
Miracles of modern science.
I am stimulating my hair follicles...

729
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,226
...and brushing my teeth
at the same time.

730
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,799
It looks really good.

731
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:22,928
What's the matter?

732
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,902
Your mom. They took her
to the hospital, Buddy.

733
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,978
What's wrong with my mother?

734
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:32,047
She's having surgery.

735
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,274
I'm sorry.

736
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,113
- Is it serious?
- When is surgery not serious?

737
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,820
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

738
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,958
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

739
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,118
...see what's going on up there.

740
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,754
Yeah. Yeah.
Why don't you just go up there.

741
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,068
Spend some quality time. I'll stay here.

742
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,864
It'll be good for you guys.

743
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,471
Oh, God.

744
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,242
You're all I got, Mom.
Please don't leave me.

745
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,719
No more clam chowder.

746
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,148
Buddy...

747
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:18,817
...it was a joke.

748
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,023
I'm sorry.
You don't have to cry anymore.

749
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,935
- A joke?
- Yeah.

750
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,761
Oh, boy.

751
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,701
A joke. A jo... I....

752
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,240
I can't believe that I fell for that one.

753
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,142
I really thought my mother
was having surgery.

754
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,050
I'm going to get you back for that one.

755
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,252
Just so you know,
she really is having surgery.

756
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,290
I thought you said you were joking.

757
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,625
No, the serious part was the joke.

758
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,166
She's having surgery,
but just minor surgery.

759
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,505
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

760
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,871
...see what's really going on up there.

761
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,640
Why don't you... ? You just
shoot up there. I'll be here.

762
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:16,841
What?

763
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,849
- I can't believe he's making me go.
- How come you guys aren't flying?

764
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:25,085
Because Dr. Cocoa Puff said legally
I'm not allowed to get on a plane.

765
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,958
Meanwhile, I've got Head up my ass
about that catalog.

766
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,895
I've got to get it done with nut-boy
in Boston.

767
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,125
Why can't Head write his own catalog?

768
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,737
Because I've got to earn
that promotion.

769
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,807
You've been doing his job for years.
You should be his...

770
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,877
I'm sorry. I know this is really
stressing you out.

771
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:45,139
I'm sure that it's going to be over
before you know it.

772
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,478
Yeah, if I don't get caught
popping any Jelly Stingers.

773
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,620
Well, that's going to be tough!

774
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,390
Oh, God. There he is.

775
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,501
- That's him?
- Yes.

776
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,166
What? Oh. Okay, I'll hold that.

777
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:12,564
My...

778
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,404
The quiet warmth

779
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:19,311
Smoldering beneath the rituals
Of hope for familiarity

780
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,279
A coursing underground river

781
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:25,819
Pregnant with the chance currents
Of knowledge and love

782
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,322
- What?
- That's my poem! I wrote that.

783
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,755
I know.

784
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,259
That is your poem. I love that poem.

785
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,024
I found it crumpled up
behind the sports pages...

786
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,292
...on the floor of David's bedroom.

787
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:44,097
- Shades of early Emily Dickinson.
- Who was great on Police Woman.

788
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,777
Thank you. And thank you
for rescuing it from the floor.

789
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,443
I think I better get going.

790
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,749
I'll miss you, big guy,
so take good care.

791
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,785
- How about a kiss?
- I'd love a kiss.

792
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,719
I think she's talking to me.
I think I can handle it.

793
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,292
So why don't you back up
an inch or two.

794
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,553
Got it.

795
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,493
Thank you. And, take care.

796
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,791
Have a great trip, you guys.

797
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,229
Oh, we will.

798
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,664
Bye.

799
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,934
What?

800
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,444
Some mindless nitwit
is parked behind me.

801
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,115
Good. Then we can't go.

802
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:27,841
No, I can get out.

803
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,985
- Get in.
- I don't know how you'll get out.

804
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:35,185
Try to wiggle out, you're going to get
a ding. But you know everything.

805
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,690
What's he doing?

806
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,336
Well, you're batting a thousand...

807
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,272
...in craziness.

808
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,012
Now we're bumping into cars.

809
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,845
I'm just making a little room
to back up.

810
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,987
If I had lost my temper...

811
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,487
...would I have had
the presence of mind...

812
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:10,626
...to leave my card
and my insurance information?

813
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:14,389
Whatever, Mr. Insane-Vein-Popping-
A-Little-Too-Far-Out-Of-His-Head-...

814
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,088
...While-Swinging-The-Bat Guy.

815
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,472
I think you've got room to back up.

816
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:42,020
Why haven't you taken Linda
off the market?

817
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,591
Think you can do better?

818
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,991
I'm going to ask her to marry me
when I'm ready.

819
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,190
Nobody wants to settle down
with a 35-year-old secretary.

820
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,857
Procrastination, Dave.

821
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,468
I'm not procrastinating.

822
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,071
I even think about how I'm
going to pop the question.

823
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,834
Husky down jacket.
Husky Eskimo look.

824
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,844
What's your plan,
ask her at a Yankee game?

825
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:06,946
Actually, yes. How did you know?

826
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,449
I said the corniest thing
I could think of.

827
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:12,622
If you knew Linda, you'd know
how uncorny it would be to her.

828
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,485
Putting up a "Marry me, please"
on the scoreboard...

829
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,992
...proclaiming my love for her
in front of thousands of strangers.

830
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:23,757
As you seem to have noticed, I'm
a little bit jumpy with public affection.

831
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,969
You seemed to be lovey-dovey
back there.

832
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,067
Glad you think that's funny.
I gotta work.

833
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,959
A five-hour trip to find out Mommy
had a jelly bean...

834
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,219
...removed from her nose.

835
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,795
I'm glad I missed work.
Can we eat now?

836
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,084
You could have her, you know.

837
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:20,150
I'm sure she'd love to hang out
with a goofy secretary...

838
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:22,883
...whose only talent
is nostril wiggling.

839
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,992
- Girls love that.
- Dave...

840
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:30,030
...you've got a lot more going for you
than wiggly nostrils.

841
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:32,997
I want you to go over there
and ask that woman out.

842
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,898
No, I got a girlfriend.

843
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,242
I'm not telling you to elope with her.
Just go over and flirt a little bit.

844
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,379
Flirting is cheating's ugly cousin,
Buddy.

845
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,274
I'm not a cheater.

846
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,142
Is it cheating if you're passed around
the cell block like a peace pipe?

847
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:54,484
Because that is what's on the docket
for you if you don't go and ask her out.

848
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,852
Okay, Dave?

849
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:58,020
Oh, God.

850
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,093
That's my boy.

851
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,396
Excuse me.

852
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:15,272
I was wondering if I could buy you
a drink. I see that you have a drink...

853
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,812
...but I could get you another
when you're through with that one.

854
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,017
Bite me.

855
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,080
Nice meeting you. Okay.

856
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:32,720
Can you guess why she rejected you?

857
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:37,162
She wanted to be like the 2000 other
girls who said that to me growing up?

858
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,894
No. Self-hypnotic negative imagery.

859
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:44,066
Confidence is the key
to winning a young lady's attention.

860
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,909
Now, listen to me very carefully.

861
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,671
- Approach Miss Thing again.
- No.

862
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:50,937
With confidence.

863
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,241
And if she says no this time...

864
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,749
...I will admit that I am a failure
as a therapist...

865
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,081
...and release you from my program.

866
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,619
You'll release me from your program?

867
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,334
Just go over there
and repeat the following...

868
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,234
...verbatim:

869
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:18,006
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

870
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:21,541
...but it's difficult for me
to express myself...

871
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:25,670
...when I'm on the verge of exploding
in my pants.

872
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,983
- Get out of here.
- Trust me, Dave.

873
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:35,723
If you are calm as well as witty,
she will respond.

874
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,293
Witty went out the window with
the pants explosion thing, thanks.

875
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,729
My offer stands.

876
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,170
So if I repeat that crazy shit...

877
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:52,499
...you probably stole from
a porno flick, you sick bastard...

878
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:54,773
...and get rejected...

879
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,002
...you'll release me from the program?

880
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,669
Exactly.

881
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,907
Here we go.

882
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,845
Go get them, Mr. Johnson.

883
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:35,974
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

884
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:42,656
...but it's difficult for me...

885
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,291
...to express myself...

886
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,936
...when I am on the verge...

887
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:09,781
...of exploding in my pants.

888
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:16,250
You are too cute.

889
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,426
Get the fuck out of here.

890
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,155
- I'm Kendra.
- I'm Dave.

891
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,627
Let me buy you a drink.

892
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:27,967
Can I get a cosmopolitan?

893
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,341
I couldn't take it anymore...

894
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:41,847
...so finally I just tell my boss:

895
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:46,112
"Hey, baldy, if I want crap out of you,
I'll squeeze your head."

896
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:50,457
- I didn't say that, but I should have.
- You are so funny.

897
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,629
Too bad you're leaving town.
We could have fun together.

898
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,660
Unfortunately, I am leaving
in the morning.

899
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,166
In fact, I think I gotta get back
to my friend.

900
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:09,502
What's the matter?

901
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:13,008
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What's wrong?

902
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,081
My friend took off on me.

903
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,149
I can give you a ride.

904
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,251
I don't even know where the guy lives.

905
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:22,448
We can hang out at my place until you
get in touch with him.

906
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,561
I bet there's like 50 Rydells in here.

907
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,135
I shouldn't eat this. I'm getting so fat.

908
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,065
What? You're not fat.

909
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,004
My clothes hide it, but I'm
getting gooey right here.

910
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,709
I don't see any goo.

911
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,436
You want to see goo,
I'll show you my ass.

912
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,682
Well, I see it,
and I didn't five years ago.

913
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,717
I went out with this guy,
and he wouldn't sleep with me.

914
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:54,880
And I asked him why, and he said that
when he saw me without my clothes...

915
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,487
...that I look like a porker.

916
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,289
He was probably just nervous
because you're beautiful and....

917
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:04,657
Anyways, you're not a porker.
You're the un-porker.

918
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,699
You're Sizzlean.

919
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:13,031
- You're so sweet, Dave.
- Well, you're sweet, Kendra.

920
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:17,269
Thanks for having me here.
He said her name was Rose.

921
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:18,946
Rose.

922
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,283
Rose Rydell. Rose Rydell.
Rose Rydell.

923
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,648
Rose Rydell! I got it!

924
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,282
Kendra...

925
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,558
...even though I'd love to see you
take that bra off...

926
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:40,098
...because it represents a team
I've hated my entire life...

927
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,562
...I think you gotta keep it on.

928
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:43,831
Why?

929
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,141
Because I got a girlfriend.

930
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,906
I'm not a child, Dave.

931
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:55,448
If you think I'm a porker, then just
come right out and say it.

932
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,347
No. I don't think you're a porker.

933
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,318
Then why when the idea of sleeping
with me comes up...

934
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,788
...do you all of a sudden
have a "girlfriend"?

935
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,519
Because I do. I do. I have a girlfriend.

936
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:07,595
Said the liar to the beached whale!

937
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,197
You're not a beached whale.

938
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,731
If anything, you could even
gain a few pounds.

939
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,235
So now I'm too skinny for you?

940
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,802
No. I didn't mean that.

941
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,998
- Is this what you want, Dave?
- No.

942
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,801
If I put on a few pounds...

943
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:25,778
...will you be able to stifle your vomit
long enough to have sex with me?!

944
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,480
Holy shit.

945
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:31,050
Are you such a hot stud
that you'll break me in two?!

946
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,451
You're angry right now. Wanna sing?
Do you know "I Feel Pretty"?

947
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,956
- Get out! Get out!
- Stop!

948
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,320
Get out!

949
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,292
Get out!!

950
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,196
Porker!

951
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:44,388
Fatty!

952
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,225
No!!

953
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,742
How did it go, pal?

954
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:05,011
- Why'd you ditch me?
- What are you talking about?

955
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,746
You gave me the signal.

956
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,048
I didn't give you the signal to leave.

957
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,820
I gave you the signal to say your
gross pickup line actually worked.

958
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:14,929
Well, of course it did.

959
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:18,767
So did Little Davey need
some anger management?

960
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,301
- That chick was killer.
- Serial killer.

961
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,939
She tried to chocolate me to death.

962
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:26,166
Anyways, I don't cheat on Linda.

963
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,646
- Speaking of Linda, she called earlier.
- Oh, yeah?

964
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:34,212
She seemed a little bit
bent out of shape.

965
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,750
- About what?
- Your being out with another woman.

966
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,980
- How would she know that?
- I told her.

967
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,489
- What else could I do?
- What else could you do?

968
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:48,153
You could've told her something else.
I was at the bank. I was at the store.

969
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,266
I ate bad guacamole
and I couldn't stop shitting!

970
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,265
Any of those would have been fine!

971
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,500
Well, I'm sorry, Dave, but I don't lie
for my patients.

972
01:02:56,672 --> 01:03:00,199
You want to leave your friend and
run off and chase some hot babe...

973
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,444
...you can't expect me to cover for you.

974
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,274
I did what you told me to do,
you sick, demented man.

975
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,408
What are you laughing at?

976
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,977
What's so funny?

977
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:19,424
Kendra is an ex-patient of mine,
an actress. Pretty good one too.

978
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:24,089
I arranged for her to be in the bar
and for you to pick her up.

979
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,199
You were messing with me?

980
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:32,102
Yeah. You know, just a joke
between friends...

981
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:35,642
...like the one you pulled on me
about my dying mother.

982
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,110
I told you I'd get you back for that.

983
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,304
All right.

984
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,048
So you really didn't talk to Linda.

985
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,823
Of course I did.
That's what made it so funny.

986
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:54,025
Where's your phone?

987
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:58,495
She's not home, Dave.
She went out with her pal Andrea.

988
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,269
She doesn't know any Andreas.
You mean Andrew?

989
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:06,134
Yeah, that's it.
Andrew, the testicle with legs.

990
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,866
"The testicle with legs." Great!!

991
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:12,674
Now wait a minute. Calm down a bit.
Try some deep breathing.

992
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,784
Maybe just hum a little "I Feel Pretty."

993
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,510
No!! How about you hum
the "I'm a Crazy Asshole" song?

994
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,419
And take me home, you
psychotic piece of wacko.

995
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,817
I never thought you'd take it like this.

996
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:40,367
So, what, we're not going to talk at all?

997
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:47,141
Would you forgive me if I told you
I called Linda last night...

998
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:50,977
...after our little fracas
and explained that it was my fault?

999
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,343
What did she say?

1000
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:57,855
Well, she's not mad at you anymore,
but she let me have it pretty good.

1001
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,153
You deserved it. I did nothing wrong.

1002
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,990
I know. I know.

1003
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:04,822
Friends?

1004
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:10,564
- Take a little nap.
- I am tired.

1005
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,571
Well, you had a rough night.

1006
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:27,913
Stop with the cupcake!

1007
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:32,361
Rise and shine, Sir Snoozola.

1008
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,163
What's going on? Where are we?

1009
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:38,129
Well, at a great deal of expense
and effort...

1010
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:41,896
...we have managed to locate
your grade school bête noire...

1011
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,060
...Arnie Shankman.

1012
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:46,436
We do desire a confrontation with him,
do we not?

1013
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:50,440
What? Do you mean the kid
who bullied me in fifth grade?

1014
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,606
Dave, I think it's pivotal for you
to confront your childhood nemesis.

1015
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,478
Remember, for 22 more days,
you are mine.

1016
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:02,086
This is where Arnie Shankman lives?

1017
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,389
You're kidding me. You're going to
make me confront a monk.

1018
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:11,893
Great.

1019
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,640
Are you ashamed that you
never stood up to him?

1020
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,641
No. He was just a kid lashing out...

1021
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,337
...because his sister got sent
to an insane asylum.

1022
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:28,074
I'm surprised your research
didn't tell you that.

1023
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,584
This doesn't look like him.

1024
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,749
Excuse me, Arnie Shankman?

1025
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,655
Sorry about waking you up.

1026
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,829
My name is Pana Kamanana...

1027
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:46,460
...but, yes, I was once known
as Arnie Shankman.

1028
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:47,996
Arnie....

1029
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,661
Pana Kamanana...

1030
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,302
...Dave Buznik
from elementary school.

1031
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:56,711
David Buznik.

1032
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,982
This is the last place I thought
I'd find you, a monastery.

1033
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:03,744
You could say I've gone through
a rather dramatic transformation.

1034
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:06,149
Could you excuse him for a second,
Peanuts?

1035
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,420
His name's not Peanuts.
It's Pana Manapia.

1036
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:14,029
You want me to fight a monk?
He's not even allowed to hurt a plant.

1037
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,632
For Pete's sake, this is the monk
that twisted your tits!

1038
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,234
Confront him or you're going to prison!

1039
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,994
All right. All right. All right.

1040
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,774
Anyways, what I wanted to say to you
was...

1041
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:36,312
...when we were kids, you kind of
bullied me around a little bit...

1042
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:40,888
...and I never really did anything
to deserve that kind of treatment.

1043
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:43,591
Of course not. I was a real cretin then.

1044
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,226
I did a lot of horrible things as a kid.

1045
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:49,660
I pushed you around.
I called you nasty names.

1046
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,662
You pulled my gym shorts down
in front of Sara Plowman.

1047
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,830
That actually was pretty funny.

1048
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,500
Jeez, I don't think that it was.

1049
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,939
Now, come, David.
Humor is the spice of life.

1050
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,147
The look on your face was priceless.

1051
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,206
"Oh! Sara saw my pee-pee!"

1052
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:11,913
So Pena likes the spicy humor.

1053
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:16,114
Maybe he'd enjoy the knee-slapper
you told me about the great Buddha.

1054
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,850
What did you say about Buddha?

1055
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:21,656
Dave said, "How does a guy
who weighs over 600 pounds...

1056
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,959
...have the balls to teach people
about self-discipline?"

1057
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,966
Let's not make fun of my God, here.

1058
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:31,698
You know what else Dave finds
particularly piquant?

1059
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,502
Recalling your nut-job sister
struggling with her underpants...

1060
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,736
...in a straitjacket.

1061
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,243
You think that's funny?

1062
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,507
Dave used to con her
into getting naked...

1063
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:43,447
...by saying that her clothes
had ghosts in them.

1064
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:44,847
That never happened.

1065
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,113
Then he'd pull out his winkie
and tell her...

1066
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,951
...it was a strawberry ice-cream cone.

1067
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,756
Is that what you've come here
to tell me?

1068
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:56,796
Did you expose yourself...

1069
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,293
...to my sister?

1070
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:04,603
- And don't shove me again.
- It's shower-room humiliation again.

1071
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:08,265
He's giving you a wet willie and
making you chew on his jockstrap...

1072
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,378
...and fart blossom and all this.

1073
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:15,517
Answer me, Buznik!
Did you get it on with my sister?

1074
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,277
Over and over again.

1075
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,625
And she moaned like a wildebeest.

1076
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,760
Wildebeest.

1077
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,932
Whoo! Now, that felt good!

1078
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,193
I wasn't expecting that
from a Buddhist.

1079
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,995
- I'm a little pissed off right now.
- You all right? You're all right.

1080
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,572
David! David! No, David!

1081
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,375
Easy, boy!

1082
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,915
Sorry.

1083
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,179
Help me, brother.

1084
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,947
- Help me.
- Okay. Come on. Come on.

1085
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,918
Okay, we're even. We're even now.

1086
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,718
- I went crazy. I'm so sorry.
- I started it.

1087
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,419
- I started it.
- It's all right.

1088
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,360
And I'm gonna finish it!

1089
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,601
Now we're even, butt-lick!

1090
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:08,960
No! Don't! Don't! Don't!

1091
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:12,869
"What's that, Auntie Em?
It's a twister!"

1092
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,666
My nipples!

1093
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,471
Pena! Look! Your sister's back.

1094
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:20,046
I got Casper in my clothes!

1095
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,550
- Pretty good.
- Thanks, baby.

1096
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,709
I'll kill you!

1097
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,589
You want that rake?

1098
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,385
You can't get that rake from me!

1099
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,027
Look, everybody!

1100
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,163
Pana Banana's got a heinie.

1101
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,661
- He's got a heinie!
- I give!

1102
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,528
- I give!
- All right. I'm sorry.

1103
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:43,166
- Friends?
- You suck!

1104
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,231
Shankman!

1105
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,900
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

1106
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:52,205
- I've seen enough.
- Hold it right there.

1107
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,611
This party's by invitation only.

1108
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,784
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

1109
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:09,153
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1110
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:17,397
Hold it back there! Come on, come on.

1111
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:18,631
Start the car!

1112
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,900
Go! Go! Go! Come on, let's go!

1113
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,169
Now! Now! Now! Now!

1114
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,312
Oh, boy!

1115
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,318
We were like Butch and Sundance!

1116
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,947
Oh, my God! I thought you
were going to shoot somebody!

1117
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:44,090
You really threw me some curves
back there, kid.

1118
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:46,996
I never expected it to go that way.

1119
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:50,166
But you kicked some serious
monk ass there, baby.

1120
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,034
You're damn right, baby!

1121
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:55,766
- How did it feel?
- I feel good! I feel incredible!

1122
01:11:56,011 --> 01:12:00,107
I feel bad about molesting his sister
all those times, but it's all right!

1123
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:04,885
- You really molested a crazy girl?
- No. Got you.

1124
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:10,623
Congratulations, keed,
you've reached level three

1125
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,528
I would never have done anything
with that girl.

1126
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:22,228
Don't worry. Dr. Rydell explained
everything to me, and I get it.

1127
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:27,467
Dr. Rydell brought up an interesting
fact about me being a procrastinator.

1128
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:30,874
...and I was going to wait
for a Yankee game to do this.

1129
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,240
...but....

1130
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:36,474
I don't know. I.... It's something
I wanted to say to you...

1131
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:40,416
...and I'm having a hard time saying it
for some reason. But....

1132
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:46,819
It's just that monks, they talk shit...

1133
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,792
...but they can't back it up.

1134
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,469
That's what was so hard to say to me?

1135
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:04,512
You know, when I was on the phone
with Buddy, he gave me some advice.

1136
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,616
That's great.
His advice is a little cuckoo...

1137
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,751
...but somehow it works.

1138
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:14,082
Well, then I guess I'll just do
what he suggested.

1139
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,729
I don't think that we should
see each other for a while.

1140
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:25,795
Buddy thinks that a trial separation
will ultimately...

1141
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:29,030
...strengthen our relationship.

1142
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:37,171
Now, Fury Fighters...

1143
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,577
...what keys do we need to possess
before we can...?

1144
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,114
Dave. You're late.

1145
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:45,219
- Can I talk to you alone, please?
- Sure you can...

1146
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:57,227
You told Linda we should have
a trial separation?

1147
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,730
- Yes.
- Yes?!

1148
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:00,093
Yes!

1149
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:03,998
Separating from Linda
is a crucial part of our strategy.

1150
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,403
My strategy is to keep my girlfriend.

1151
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,838
All right. Strictly as a friend.

1152
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:13,075
Linda's been thinking about
leaving you for some time.

1153
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:16,915
She loves you, but she
recognizes you're a neurotic mess.

1154
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,175
You're jealous...

1155
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:22,551
...self-loathing, resentful, insecure
and a premature ejaculator.

1156
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:25,155
She told you I was
a premature ejaculator?

1157
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:26,692
That part I was assuming.

1158
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,627
I haven't done that in,
like, eight months.

1159
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:35,259
Anyway, a trial separation will make
you both gain a deeper appreciation...

1160
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,597
...for David Buznik.

1161
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:42,269
After she dates a couple of losers,
she'll be begging you to take her back.

1162
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:51,552
So I've been thinking about it,
Linda...

1163
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:56,348
...and a trial separation is exactly
what we need.

1164
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:59,618
And if you want to start seeing...

1165
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:02,558
...other penises... People...

1166
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,095
...I want you to feel free.

1167
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:09,270
You sound upset. Are you all right?

1168
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:16,442
I'm fine. Just date anybody you'd like.

1169
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:18,545
And don't hold back, okay?

1170
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:22,944
Because there's a lot of nice guys
out there and I'm cool with it.

1171
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:24,709
I'll be strong.

1172
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,184
So the guy asked me for change.
I laughed. He cursed.

1173
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,418
I whizzed on him.

1174
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:36,258
- What else could I do, huh?
- You should've tossed a rock at him.

1175
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:39,729
That's your solution for everything.
The guy's homeless, right?

1176
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:41,731
Let him be. Set your anger free.

1177
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:46,139
Look at you, Lou. You've really calmed
down since working with Dr. B.

1178
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,242
- We all have.
- Hey, fellas.

1179
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:50,903
Could you bring it down a little bit?

1180
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,912
We're trying to have dinner.
The walls are really thin.

1181
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,846
- This is a free country!
- What's going on with you?!

1182
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,280
- Are you crazy?!
- Go in! Just go in.

1183
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,291
Goosfraba! Goosfraba!

1184
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,518
Goosfraba.

1185
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,320
Very good.
What are you guys doing here?

1186
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:11,829
I need to see Dr. B. I'm in crisis.

1187
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,662
He's not here.
Why don't you go look for him?

1188
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:19,296
Davey, your girlfriend stopped by
and she dropped these off for you.

1189
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,942
Those are her keys to my apartment.

1190
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:25,341
I think your girlfriend's cheating
on you.

1191
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:28,343
- Why?
- I heard her on her cell phone...

1192
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,212
...talking to a guy...

1193
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,984
- ...making a date.
- I'm so sorry, Dave.

1194
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:35,822
Andrew.

1195
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,252
I'll kill that guy.

1196
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:42,160
She ain't cheating on me by the way.
We agreed to take a break.

1197
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:45,823
She's not taking a break
from the old sausage, huh?

1198
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,390
Sorry.

1199
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:50,433
She's meeting the Andrew at Mort's
on 86th Street now...

1200
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,868
...if you want to go watch.

1201
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:56,207
No. No, I can't do that.

1202
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:02,839
We're here.

1203
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,615
- Both of you showed up?
- You like Stacy better or something?

1204
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:10,952
It's just that I want to go on a fake
date to get my girlfriend jealous...

1205
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,287
...so I really only needed
one of you guys.

1206
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:15,462
Well, now she'll be twice as jealous.

1207
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:18,791
- So do you know the guy she's with?
- I think I might.

1208
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,264
Let me ask you something.

1209
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:24,633
Because of your profession
you probably have seen a lot of them.

1210
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:29,140
Does size count at all, or is that just
some weird thing guys think about?

1211
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:32,178
This is where Gina and I
always get into a heated debate.

1212
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,178
I like them when they're really big.

1213
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:37,045
And I think it's better
when they're enormous.

1214
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,525
Good evening.

1215
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,821
Table for three?

1216
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,863
- May we take your coats?
- No. We're okay.

1217
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,365
The girls are gonna
take their coats off.

1218
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,696
Would you like a boobs... ? Booth?

1219
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:03,505
Actually, could you give us a table
overlooking that table right there?

1220
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,647
- Sure. Right this way.
- Thank you.

1221
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:12,410
Oh, my God. It's Stacy and Gina.

1222
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:13,986
Who?

1223
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,680
Nobody.

1224
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,121
I'm so hungry I could eat you, Dave.

1225
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,950
Yummy. Yummy.

1226
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,788
- Let's get wasted tonight.
- Definitely.

1227
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:27,128
Have fun.
Lucky son of a bitch.

1228
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,237
What?

1229
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,936
I can't believe this.

1230
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,441
Excuse me.

1231
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:41,275
Linda. I'm a little embarrassed. I
didn't know you were going to be here.

1232
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,917
I guess not. Are those your friends?

1233
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:47,852
I'm supposed to date other people
so I figured I'd give it a try.

1234
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,852
Gina, can you stop sucking
on Stacy's finger for one second?

1235
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:58,192
I want to introduce you to somebody.

1236
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:02,100
- Stacy, Gina, this is Linda.
- Nice to meet you.

1237
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:05,032
And I'd like you to meet my date.

1238
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:08,371
Ladies, this is Buddy Rydell.

1239
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,640
- Look, Dave, it's Buddy.
- I see.

1240
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:14,748
- You know Stacy and Gina?
- Yes, yes, I do.

1241
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,646
We're in Dave's anger group.
Fury Fighters!

1242
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,848
Well, gee whiz.
Here's your Rémy, Linda.

1243
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,991
This is a bit awkward.

1244
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,717
I mean, group members...

1245
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:28,328
...are not supposed to get
romantically involved.

1246
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:31,432
- Yeah! I agree with that.
- You know that.

1247
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,694
I'd like to talk to you alone
for a second.

1248
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:38,601
There's a rage control technique I'd
like to go over with you right now.

1249
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,435
Of course. Excuse me...

1250
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,001
What?

1251
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:47,447
- Two of the usual, Duke.
- Coming right up, Dr. B.

1252
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,483
You're the biggest backstabbing
piece of crap I ever met.

1253
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,613
What are you saying?

1254
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,018
I'm trying to give you a hand.
It's my job.

1255
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,818
Bullshit!
Your job is to steal my girlfriend?!

1256
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:00,358
My job is trying to prevent
Mr. Andrew...

1257
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:03,464
...from unleashing the Whopper
with Cheese.

1258
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,661
That's right. Since you've
been out of the picture...

1259
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:09,531
...Andrew's been burning up the wires
night and day...

1260
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:13,297
...trying to rekindle those
hotsie-totsie nights up at Brown U.

1261
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,342
- How would you know?
- You think I only tapped your phone?

1262
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,012
What was she saying?

1263
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:21,979
The good news is, I already launched
a preemptive strike.

1264
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,983
Now the situation is contained.

1265
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:27,144
You and I control the game.

1266
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,378
How?

1267
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:31,890
I will be uncharacteristically
aggressively boring.

1268
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,996
I keep talking about myself,
acting arrogant and obnoxious.

1269
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,164
When Linda sees what
the dating world is really like...

1270
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:42,997
...then guess who comes out
smelling like a white mushroom?

1271
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:50,344
- You swear to me this will work?
- The ball's already up in the air.

1272
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,512
Incidentally, nice move
bringing the girls.

1273
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:57,174
Very strong. Come on.

1274
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,048
I'll see you at home
in a half-hour, keed.

1275
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,091
That's 25 dollars, pal.

1276
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,022
We don't....

1277
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:42,960
Where were you? It's 1:00.

1278
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:47,328
When you hear what happened, you'll
bow down and worship me like a god.

1279
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,629
- Better be good. Give it to me.
- Okay.

1280
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:52,864
After dinner, she insisted we go home.
So we hop on the bus...

1281
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,601
The bus? You took the bus?
What happened to your car?

1282
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:57,404
I was way too smashed to drive.

1283
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:02,812
I told her I didn't want to waste money
on a cab. That did not go down well.

1284
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:05,375
Okay. I like that.

1285
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,714
So we get to her house...

1286
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:11,219
...we have some kind of a weird
argument...

1287
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:14,726
...about the number of syllables
in a haiku.

1288
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:16,261
Poetry garbage.

1289
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:19,830
She said it was getting late,
we kissed and I headed on home.

1290
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:23,702
Now, you say you kissed?

1291
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:26,567
It was nothing. Little five-second kiss.
That's all.

1292
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:28,231
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1293
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,967
You're having this horrible evening.

1294
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:34,582
- How do you end up kissing, again?
- I wish I knew, keed.

1295
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,343
We were both pretty geezed up.

1296
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:41,419
One second we're fighting,
and the next second we're laughing...

1297
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,988
...and then just a quick
10-second kiss.

1298
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,627
I thought that you said five seconds.

1299
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,456
First it was a five-second one...

1300
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,997
...and then a little break because
my beard gave her a tickle.

1301
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:55,132
She's cute.
And then a 10-second Frencher.

1302
01:22:56,271 --> 01:23:00,503
You had your crazy, corroded tongue
in my girlfriend's mouth?

1303
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:05,043
Just a second. Just one second, Dave.

1304
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:08,077
Dr. B, let it bip.

1305
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,843
Well, hello.

1306
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:15,018
I shouldn't really talk right now.

1307
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,352
Well, I suppose you're right.

1308
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,592
It's got to be done.

1309
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:24,426
Who was that? Linda?

1310
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:32,699
I've got some good news for you
and some potentially upsetting news.

1311
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,705
First, the good news.

1312
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:37,538
I'm going to sign your papers.
You're a free man.

1313
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:39,942
Let me hear
the potentially upsetting news.

1314
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:44,608
Linda and I have fallen
for one another.

1315
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,219
Pretty hard too.

1316
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:49,614
David, I hope you believe me
when I say this:

1317
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,622
I didn't intend for this to happen.

1318
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:54,557
It was no one's fault, I guess.
It was just...

1319
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:56,287
Wait a minute.

1320
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,336
I figured this out.

1321
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,743
You're messing with me.

1322
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:13,141
I wish I were, Dave.

1323
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:18,483
However, I did insist that we not
go forward without your blessing...

1324
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:23,590
...because we're best friends.
So, what do you say, Dave?

1325
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,992
Is it all right if I date your ex?

1326
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:32,991
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

1327
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:35,830
I am appalled by your assault
on Dr. Rydell.

1328
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:39,405
Obviously, anger management
has been a complete failure for you.

1329
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:43,533
I'm setting a trial date for 3 weeks
from today for attempted murder.

1330
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:47,477
As for Dr. Rydell's safety,
I'm issuing a restraining order.

1331
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:50,982
Which means that at no time can you
come within 500 feet of him...

1332
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:53,518
...or his lovely new girlfriend, Linda.

1333
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:55,417
Court is adjourned.

1334
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,171
Coming, Peaches.

1335
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,481
Are you kidding me?

1336
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,286
Numb-nuts, where's the catalog
for my Fat Cat clothing line?

1337
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:36,930
I said I'd have it by 3.

1338
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:40,763
- Okay.
- Get in gear.

1339
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:45,838
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1340
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:48,669
I hope you have it.
My presentation's in two hours.

1341
01:25:48,843 --> 01:25:51,937
What's this? Your fat-shit cat's
been sitting there all day.

1342
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:53,646
Don't worry about him.

1343
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,716
Here you go.
I think you're gonna like it.

1344
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,183
It's good stuff.

1345
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,928
That's a good picture, I think.

1346
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:11,095
What the hell is this?!

1347
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:14,326
You keep telling everybody you
created the Husky Cat line.

1348
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:17,003
I thought you'd want your picture
in there. No?

1349
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,470
Question: Can I get two couches
in my office?

1350
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:22,269
If friends come over, I want them
to feel comfortable.

1351
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:23,501
What office?

1352
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:28,047
Frank was nice enough to give me
some creative executive position.

1353
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:32,920
- You gave him the job that I wanted?
- He earned it.

1354
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,555
Why can't you be happy for me?
Linda's gonna be.

1355
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:38,587
Know something?
I'm sick of you hanging out with Linda.

1356
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,251
She dumped you 15 years ago.
Get over it.

1357
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:42,828
I wouldn't worry about me.

1358
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:46,194
It's your pal Buddy who's taking her
to the Yankee game tonight.

1359
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:48,401
Yankee game.

1360
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,832
Did he steal my proposal idea?

1361
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:55,135
Buznik, your behavior is unacceptable.

1362
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:58,175
Unacceptable?

1363
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:03,840
I've been getting your coffee and
doing your work for five years now.

1364
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:06,145
When a good position
actually opens up...

1365
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,787
...you give it to the biggest dick
in the world?

1366
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:12,893
I don't know about the world, but it's
definitely the biggest one in the room.

1367
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:16,924
Now, when I started here...

1368
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:20,100
...I was promised advancement
opportunities.

1369
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:23,429
And breaking that promise, to me,
is unacceptable.

1370
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,334
You see? I golf also.
You should bring me sometime.

1371
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:32,808
So when I get out of jail, sometime
in the next two to five years...

1372
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:37,748
...I expect you to give me the position
that Andrew just resigned from.

1373
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:40,717
- Okay.
- Great.

1374
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,049
Have fun looking like Colonel Klink.

1375
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:49,254
By the way, his name is not
Fat-shit Cat, it's Meatball...

1376
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:52,092
...and he's eating your crab cakes
right now.

1377
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:01,941
- You starting to get excited?
- Are you kidding? I'm out of my mind.

1378
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,771
This is going to be some night.

1379
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:08,343
Come on. Come on.

1380
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:21,389
- Dr. B, how's it going?
- Very well, thank you.

1381
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,056
Always a thrill. Right this way.

1382
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,362
Where the hell's a spot?
Where's a spot?

1383
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:31,764
Whoa! Watch it, man!

1384
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:32,106
Your attention, please.

1385
01:28:32,107 --> 01:28:33,539
Your attention, please.

1386
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,539
Before tonight's National Anthem...

1387
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:38,770
...Metropolitan Opera star Robert
Merrill...

1388
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:43,713
...will present a special moment
for two special people.

1389
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:45,942
I love when they do this.

1390
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:50,651
- Good.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Merrill.

1391
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:07,698
Linda?! Linda!

1392
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:28,794
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

1393
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:31,221
Wait, don't I know you?

1394
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:33,333
- Come on.
- Where's your German accent?

1395
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:39,937
You have me confused with somebody...

1396
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:42,770
I wanna get on the field.
I'm a fan of Mr. Merrill's.

1397
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:45,572
- There's no fans allowed on that field.
- Galaxia.

1398
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:47,636
It's Gary.

1399
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:51,478
Whatever. Someone else will marry
my woman if you don't let me go.

1400
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:56,081
- Hebrew Melvin's in love.
- Very much.

1401
01:29:57,658 --> 01:29:59,751
I can't stop love.

1402
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:01,757
- Go.
- Thank you.

1403
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:06,529
Don't think I don't owe you
a couple smacks by the way.

1404
01:30:07,635 --> 01:30:11,469
Good evening. Tonight, romance
comes to Yankee Stadium.

1405
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:16,040
Oh, my God, it's Dave.

1406
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:18,341
What the heck are you doing here?

1407
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,013
- I wanna borrow this for a second.
- That's my mike!

1408
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:22,672
Linda? Where are you?

1409
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:24,681
Don't move.

1410
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:27,610
Linda? Are you out there, honey?

1411
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,215
Linda, I'm not mad at you.

1412
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:35,622
Oh, shit.

1413
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,224
I know that crazy man
brought you here.

1414
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,371
Davey's going crazy!

1415
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:47,303
I've done crazier stuff than that
to win back a chick.

1416
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,568
Once I ran naked
through a subway station.

1417
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,143
How was that supposed to work?

1418
01:30:51,646 --> 01:30:54,046
I guess I never really
thought it through.

1419
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:58,214
I gotta tell you something personal!

1420
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:00,979
This kid lost his marbles.

1421
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,447
I'm over here!

1422
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:09,394
Linda, think about
what you're doing to us.

1423
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:13,558
Sweet tackle. Wow!

1424
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:15,668
Dave just got leveled!

1425
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:20,332
- Nobody messes with my microphone.
- I'm sorry.

1426
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:21,939
Bob?

1427
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:25,341
- Everything all right, Buddy?
- Oh, yeah.

1428
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,276
I've never seen you so excited.

1429
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:30,212
It's not every day a man
gets to propose marriage...

1430
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:31,908
...to the woman he loves.

1431
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:34,919
Now, here's what I want you to write
on the scoreboard.

1432
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:38,923
Linda! Linda, I've loved you
since the day I met you!

1433
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:41,254
I won't let you do this to us!

1434
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:44,562
Don't marry him!

1435
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,366
Don't marry him!

1436
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:49,499
Wait!

1437
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,966
Let this man finish
what he came here to say.

1438
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,103
Let the man back in.

1439
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:58,541
- Who was that guy?
- I think it's Regis Philbin.

1440
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:04,245
Thank you, Mayor Giuliani.
You're the man, by the way.

1441
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:08,988
This clown better hurry up.
My arm's starting to ice over.

1442
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,647
Chill, Rocket. Goosfraba.

1443
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:13,191
Goosfraba.

1444
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:15,929
Goosfraba.

1445
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:22,600
I can understand why you wanted
to see other people. I really can.

1446
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:25,461
Buddy Rydell is a psycho!

1447
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:28,305
But he was right about one thing.

1448
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,601
I was an angry guy.

1449
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:34,307
Mainly angry at myself...

1450
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:37,542
...for letting people treat me like crap
all the time.

1451
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:40,476
But I don't want to be that angry guy
anymore.

1452
01:32:40,655 --> 01:32:42,054
I wanna change.

1453
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,721
If you give me a chance...

1454
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:47,725
...I can show you that I got the guts
to stand up for what I believe in.

1455
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,487
And I believe in us, Linda.

1456
01:32:49,764 --> 01:32:53,928
I love you with all my heart,
and I know you love me back.

1457
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:56,463
I should be your husband...

1458
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:58,801
...not that weirdo.

1459
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:05,109
I want to have a family with you.
I want to have kids with you.

1460
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:08,112
Kids who have your eyes...

1461
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:09,681
...and your lips...

1462
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:11,615
...and my...

1463
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,480
...last name.
That's all I wish on them.

1464
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:19,091
Please marry me, Linda.

1465
01:33:24,865 --> 01:33:28,301
Before I make my decision,
you have to do something for me.

1466
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:35,169
You have to kiss me
in front of all these people!

1467
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:43,048
You can do it, David!

1468
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:47,214
Give her a five-second Frencher!

1469
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,389
Kiss her, David.

1470
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,990
Kiss her, David.

1471
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,729
Kiss her, David!

1472
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,794
Kiss her, David.

1473
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:12,437
Go Yankees!

1474
01:34:29,797 --> 01:34:31,992
Dave's a dirty boy.

1475
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,760
That wasn't so bad, was it?

1476
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:40,639
I can't believe you actually
started to fall for that crazy man.

1477
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:43,174
Buddy's not such a bad guy.

1478
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:51,779
Congratulations! You just graduated
from anger management!

1479
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:17,035
I'm glad your car died.
The train's romantic.

1480
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,735
Don't change the subject.

1481
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:23,782
You're telling me the past two weeks
of my life was just therapy?

1482
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,212
Well....

1483
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:26,608
Yeah.

1484
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:29,081
I met with Buddy
after reading his book...

1485
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:32,623
...and I told him about some
of the things going on in your life...

1486
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:37,787
...and how upset it was making you
and how nuts it was making me.

1487
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:42,732
He said that he thought he could help,
but it would be tough.

1488
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,961
So how much of this thing was a setup?

1489
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:49,506
Well, the guy in your seat on the
plane, the flight attendant, the judge...

1490
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:51,668
...they're all friends of Buddy's.

1491
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:55,213
What about the air marshal
who tasered me? Was he in on it?

1492
01:35:55,382 --> 01:35:57,213
No, he was just having a bad day.

1493
01:35:57,384 --> 01:35:59,978
Son of a bitch.

1494
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:13,929
Skipper, how you doing?

1495
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:18,996
Buddy Rydell, you're a great man.

1496
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:22,640
I was just doing my job.
I never doubted you for a minute.

1497
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:25,343
Except when Galaxia had ahold of you.

1498
01:36:27,248 --> 01:36:29,580
Did you just call that guy
Buddy Rydell?

1499
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:33,818
A guy named Buddy Rydell
left this card...

1500
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:35,615
...on what's left of my Lexus!

1501
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,384
Oh, yeah. For insurance purposes.

1502
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:40,493
Your insurance was canceled!

1503
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,661
Grenada!

1504
01:36:45,499 --> 01:36:48,866
Don't point that gun at Buddy.
I'm the one who smashed your car up.

1505
01:36:49,036 --> 01:36:50,162
- Dave?!
- No!

1506
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:51,963
I'm sick of guys like this.

1507
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:54,471
You wanna mess with my friends,
shoot me first.

1508
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:55,870
- Don't!
- Are you crazy?

1509
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:57,370
Settle down.

1510
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:00,207
Butt out! Tough guy's
going to learn a lesson.

1511
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:04,916
I'm not afraid. Dr. Rydell taught me
not to be afraid of anybody.

1512
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:09,549
Can I ask you a question, though?

1513
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:19,892
Got you!

1514
01:37:23,904 --> 01:37:26,896
Dr. B, Davey just pulled a joke on us!

1515
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:29,439
And how does that make you feel, Lou?

1516
01:37:41,589 --> 01:37:43,454
Chuck.

1517
01:37:43,624 --> 01:37:46,092
We were just doing a joke.
That's my friend.

1518
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:47,692
Are you okay?

1519
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:54,033
He feels stunning.
