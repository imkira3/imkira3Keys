2
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,683
You shouldn't do that.

3
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:13,286
Tap the glass.

4
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:17,082
How did you know
I was going to?

5
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:21,091
You must forgive my son.
He loves bees.

6
00:01:21,892 --> 00:01:24,026
It isn't a bee. It's a wasp.

7
00:01:28,197 --> 00:01:29,964
Different thing entirely.

8
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,463
Was that him?

9
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:14,996
Ah, the prodigal returns.

10
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,400
Ooh.

11
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:28,506
Outside, Roger.
You know you're not allowed.

12
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:34,243
Like having a Welsh pony.

13
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:39,308
Will you be going up
to your study?

14
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,814
No, not as yet.

15
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,411
Ah, yes. Home again.

16
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:20,848
Home again.

17
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,456
Mrs. Munro!

18
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:37,195
It would appear we've had
a decrease in population.

19
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:41,999
Did Mr. Healy not come by

20
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,334
to take care of the apiary
whilst I was gone?

21
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:46,576
Yes, but he won't be able
to do it next time.

22
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,639
- Did Mr. Healy say that?
- No, his daughter did.

23
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:54,141
She's taken him to live
with her. Too feeble, she said.

24
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,677
- Is he too feeble?
- Seemed spry enough.

25
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,578
- Chattier, maybe.
- With you?

26
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,379
With himself.

27
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,447
Key to the study.

28
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:16,057
- Is that lunch?
- Mm.

29
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:20,627
Hmm...

30
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,005
<i>Watson had married
and I was alone.</i>

31
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,574
<i>In fact, it was on the very day
he left Baker Street</i>

32
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:48,678
<i>that the case which was
to be my last began to unfold.</i>

33
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:57,753
<i>It was almost 30 years ago.
The Great War had ended</i>

34
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:00,088
<i>and the tourists
had come back to Baker Street</i>

35
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,890
<i>to catch a glimpse
of the real Sherlock Holmes.</i>

36
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,426
<i>Thankfully, in his stories,</i>

37
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,528
<i>Watson had always published
a false address</i>

38
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,829
<i>for our actual quarters.</i>

39
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,097
So you found the right address.

40
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:35,752
- Why did you do it?
- Sir?

41
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,354
Break into my study.

42
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:41,123
My study is
my sanctum sanctorum.

43
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:43,557
Private place.

44
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:50,595
Before you went to Japan,
I saw you writing that story.

45
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:53,296
I didn't know you wrote stories.

46
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,931
Oh, Dr. Watson, yes,
he was the writer.

47
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:59,166
Well, so I borrowed Mum's key
and went into your study,

48
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:00,167
and there it was.

49
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,536
And how much did you read?

50
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:05,372
Just to where you stopped.
It was a good part too.

51
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:06,706
A man comes to Baker Street.

52
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,240
You say,
"You've come about your wife."

53
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,976
How could you tell?
Did you do the thing?

54
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:13,244
What thing would that be?

55
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,612
"The cane shows the marks
of a dog's teeth.

56
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,247
The wood is from an island
southwest of Madeira."

57
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:20,714
That thing.

58
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:23,249
And how would you tell

59
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:25,551
that a man's visit
was about his wife?

60
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:27,412
He wears a wedding ring?

61
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:31,787
No.
The clues are all on that page.

62
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,756
This sentence, to be exact.

63
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:37,925
"One day, into the room
came a young man,

64
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:41,060
in newly-pressed,
albeit inexpensive clothes."

65
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,163
The clothes are freshly-pressed.
He's a young man, though.

66
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,098
Not expensive clothes.

67
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,100
Then his wife must press them.
Men don't have the talent

68
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,182
and he can't afford
a servant to do so.

69
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:53,336
Very good.

70
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:54,904
That's how you knew
it was about the wife.

71
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:55,971
Well, no.

72
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,806
When you're a detective
and a man comes to visit you...

73
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,141
it's usually about his wife.

74
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,177
So why did you stop
where you did?

75
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:21,258
Ahh...

76
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,527
Ah, did you get the things
from the chemist?

77
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,636
On order.
Said it would be a few days.

78
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,104
We'll hold them to that.

79
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:39,639
Otherwise, triumphant, were you?

80
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:41,974
Like V-E Day.

81
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:45,110
Oh. Doctor's here.

82
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,885
- Did you catch cold in Japan?
- Does it sound it?

83
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:58,974
I thought you might be coming
off the tail end of something.

84
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:01,356
Lost some weight as well.
Hmm.

85
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,326
Did you find
what you were looking for,

86
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:06,894
the mysterious ashy prick?

87
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:09,263
Prickly ash.

88
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:10,464
Oh, yes, sorry.

89
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:14,100
That was the reason the fellow
invited you to Japan, wasn't it?

90
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:16,469
Dig up a pile of the stuff,
smuggle it home?

91
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,138
It can't interfere
with anything you've prescribed.

92
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:23,842
- But surely it can't do me ill.
- In and of itself, no.

93
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,343
You mean there might be
side effects?

94
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:27,544
Perhaps.

95
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,979
- Such as?
- Hope.

96
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:42,490
What was the name of the fellow
who invited you to Japan?

97
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,361
You just spent a week
with the man,

98
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:50,864
corresponded with him
for months.

99
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:53,132
Do you recall his name?

100
00:10:56,202 --> 00:11:00,204
There's a flat adjacent to
my surgery that's gone to let...

101
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:02,039
No!

102
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,740
What happens when you don't
recall where the telephone is,

103
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:06,209
or you forget
to turn off the gas?

104
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:09,378
- You can't live alone.
- I don't live alone.

105
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,211
I have the housekeeper.

106
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,147
Take this diary.

107
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:21,152
Each day you don't recall
a name or place,

108
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,988
make a mark on the page
for that day's date.

109
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:28,824
And if I forget
to make the mark?

110
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:52,312
Oh... Mm.

111
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:56,582
No, no, no. No. No, no, no.

112
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,750
It's the royal jelly.

113
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,832
Yes, well,
we're not using it anymore.

114
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
Instead,
we're going to use this.

115
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:07,924
- It's called prickly ash.
- Is it food?

116
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,558
Mm...

117
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,426
Eurgh. Looks like
it came out the down-spout.

118
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:13,994
It came from Japan.

119
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:16,829
That makes all the difference.

120
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:19,264
You add it in as you would
the royal jelly,

121
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:20,831
in the tea or the coffee.

122
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,135
And you should try
cooking with it

123
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,870
to enhance your specialities.

124
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:28,926
Mr. Holmes?

125
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:31,594
Mr. Holmes?

126
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,465
Tamiki Umezaki.

127
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:40,634
Welcome to Japan.

128
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:46,104
I am so honoured
you have accepted my invitation.

129
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:51,241
We spend tonight at my house.
Tomorrow we begin our search.

130
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,175
I have owned your book
for 20 years.

131
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,797
I purchased my copy
when it first appeared in print.

132
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,848
I hope you'll do me the honour
of a personal inscription.

133
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:40,484
Oh, yes. Of course.

134
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:44,787
Um...

135
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:51,059
Mr. Umezaki,
how close to the city

136
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:53,361
does the prickly ash grow?

137
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:56,129
It is found
mostly near the sea.

138
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:57,930
And how far
shall we have to go?

139
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,832
Where I am thinking
is two days' journey by train.

140
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,336
You are very eager?

141
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:09,272
I'm in the middle of a project
that I'm keen to finish

142
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:12,174
and my wits must be
at their sharpest.

143
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,008
I want to be able to benefit

144
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,010
from the effect
as soon as possible.

145
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:19,012
- It's that urgent?
- I fear it's so.

146
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:24,516
You are very great detective!

147
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,484
Thank you very much.

148
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,758
My mother, she wonders

149
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,893
if you have brought
your famous hat.

150
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:41,595
Oh, the deer stalker.

151
00:15:42,797 --> 00:15:45,832
That was an embellishment
of the illustrator.

152
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:48,934
I've never worn one.

153
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:52,236
- And the pipe?
- I prefer a cigar.

154
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:56,039
I told Watson,
if I ever write a story myself,

155
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,941
it will be to correct
the million misconceptions

156
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:01,009
created by his imaginative license.

157
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:04,210
Did you write such a story?

158
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,780
But I'm trying to do so now.

159
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:32,100
I must finish with you
before I die.

160
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:45,312
"So you've come
about your wife."

161
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,217
<i>"You've come about your wife."</i>

162
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:53,918
"You've come..."

163
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:10,834
Roger.

164
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,903
Here.

165
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:16,972
I'll see you after lunch.

166
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:20,227
I'm going to need some help
with the bees.

167
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,653
So you found the right address.

168
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,122
A friendly porter at 221B.

169
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,325
It's just a minor fiction
to mislead the curious.

170
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,181
Most of them
seem to be American.

171
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:48,030
Have a seat, Mr. Kelmot.

172
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:54,035
So...

173
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:56,503
you've come about your wife.

174
00:17:57,605 --> 00:17:59,572
- How did you know?
- It doesn't matter.

175
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:01,540
Tell me what you have to say.

176
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:03,541
My wife is named Ann.

177
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,110
Her mother died in childbirth.

178
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:09,145
Her father was a colonel,

179
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:11,187
killed in that business
at Waziristan.

180
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:14,268
<i>We wanted very much
to have children.</i>

181
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:19,053
She lost our first child
in her third month...

182
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:22,622
<i>Our second in her fourth.</i>

183
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:27,545
<i>We were told it was
too dangerous to try again.</i>

184
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:31,295
<i>Ann was... distraught.</i>

185
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:38,934
It was as though
each of them lost

186
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:40,976
had been a real child,
as opposed to...

187
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,039
Thank you.

188
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:50,843
For a time,
she even insisted I have

189
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:52,010
a pair of headstones carved

190
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:53,745
and placed in our cemetery plot,

191
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:55,787
as if their bodies
were buried beneath.

192
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,580
She was in desperate need

193
00:18:57,582 --> 00:18:59,515
of something to soothe
this dangerous melancholy.

194
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:02,351
She liked music so I suggested
the glass armonica.

195
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:03,752
The armonica?

196
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:05,553
My father's
most prized possession.

197
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:07,836
<i>He played it constantly
till the day he died.</i>

198
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:10,223
<i>I had it brought to the house</i>

199
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:12,385
<i>and arranged
a month's worth of lessons.</i>

200
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,140
<i>One hour per week.</i>

201
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:15,927
Soon Ann asked me if she could

202
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:17,929
increase the lessons
to twice a week.

203
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,530
Then three times.
Then every day.

204
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,600
<i>So, she took up the avocation
you hoped she would.</i>

205
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,602
Why are you here, Mr. Kelmot?

206
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:31,138
Mr. Holmes,
my Ann has changed.

207
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,906
And it isn't just the lessons

208
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:35,908
or her obsession
with the instrument.

209
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,110
<i>One day I was outside the room</i>

210
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,152
<i>and suddenly
her playing stopped.</i>

211
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:45,747
<i>And I heard her saying,
quite clearly...</i>

212
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:49,683
Grace? James?

213
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:54,320
Those were to be
the names of your children?

214
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,362
When I confronted Ann,
she denied it.

215
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:58,623
So I forbad her
playing the armonica

216
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,625
and I forbad her
taking the lessons.

217
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:02,659
The woman who teaches them,
Madame Schirmer,

218
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,621
is a person
of dangerous beliefs.

219
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,895
The dangerous beliefs
of a music teacher?

220
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,496
She's put a spell on Ann,

221
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:10,831
preying upon
her weak frame of mind,

222
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,065
for what reason I cannot say.

223
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,133
Have you proof of this?

224
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,101
Following my instructions,

225
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:17,635
she stopped seeing
Madame Schirmer.

226
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:21,170
I received in the post...
three receipts from the woman.

227
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:25,474
Each for the payment
of one armonica lesson.

228
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,809
Again Ann denied it.

229
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,744
Consequently, my wife
is no longer permitted

230
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,378
to withdraw money from the bank.

231
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,413
<i>Then yesterday, I followed Ann</i>

232
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:37,735
<i>to the place where
the woman gives her lessons.</i>

233
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,590
<i>Even on the pavement below
I could hear her playing.</i>

234
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:44,252
<i>Naturally, I went inside,
but the Schirmer woman said,</i>

235
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:45,820
"Your wife is not here."

236
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:48,822
Last night, I questioned Ann.

237
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:53,025
And she said that she hadn't
been to Madame Schirmer's rooms.

238
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:54,159
Not for weeks.

239
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,997
Do you have
a portrait of your wife?

240
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,642
I shall take your case if you
answer just one last question.

241
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:14,776
Certainly.

242
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:17,738
What perfume
does your wife wear?

243
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,013
Roger?

244
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,184
It's late.
Lights out like it's the Blitz.

245
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,591
Look at you.

246
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,228
Do you remember your dad?

247
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,131
I remember him holding my hand
and taking me to the sea.

248
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,034
You're not remembering.
That's the picture.

249
00:21:50,303 --> 00:21:52,370
What about
the invisible stories?

250
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:55,839
Some nights at bedtime,
your dad would make up stories.

251
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:59,075
He'd... he'd say,
"Give me three things."

252
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:04,079
And you'd say,
"A ball, a cat and Roger."

253
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:06,881
So then he'd...

254
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:09,215
he'd make up some tale

255
00:22:09,217 --> 00:22:12,551
about a ball that had
a pet cat named Roger.

256
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:16,041
Always a something
and something and Roger.

257
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:23,633
You don't remember
any of the invisible stories?

258
00:22:24,862 --> 00:22:27,830
No. Do you?

259
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,794
I was never any good
at stories.

260
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,476
Sleep well.

261
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:50,116
<i>The first thing
to know is there's no danger.</i>

262
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,718
Bees aren't interested
in harming you.

263
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,320
Their only concern
is self-preservation.

264
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:57,021
From people?

265
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:59,063
They're much too clever
for people.

266
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:03,693
Their enemies are the weather,
disease and predators.

267
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:06,528
The wasp is their
particular antagonist.

268
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,596
Did you know that one wasp

269
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:11,765
can kill 40 honey bees
in under a minute?

270
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,201
In consequence,
we do not like wasps.

271
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,402
Yes, sir.

272
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:18,244
- We do not like wasps.
- Ah.

273
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:21,006
The queen runs the colony.

274
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,942
The drones service the queen.

275
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:26,376
Hands up.

276
00:23:28,746 --> 00:23:31,380
Workers do the work.
As it should be.

277
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:47,827
Of concern is the latest
decrease in the bee population.

278
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:52,163
We've identified the problem,
and now we must solve it.

279
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,465
Right. There you are.
Off you go.

280
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,333
Have you ever been bitten

281
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,902
by a bee?
- Stung.

282
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:02,070
Bees don't have teeth.
Yes, I have.

283
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:03,232
Well, not often, though.

284
00:24:04,072 --> 00:24:06,406
7,816 times.

285
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:08,007
I keep a record.

286
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,546
You're not entirely dreadful.

287
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:19,681
You ever been bit?

288
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,818
No. I have never been bit.

289
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:31,156
Well, people work with bees
all the time, don't they?

290
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,367
What is royal jelly?

291
00:24:44,602 --> 00:24:47,270
It's a special secretion
of the worker bees.

292
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:50,506
- And it's royal because?
- It feeds the queen.

293
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:52,174
Bravo.

294
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:55,376
It was the jelly's
curative powers

295
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:57,411
that prompted my monograph,

296
00:24:58,045 --> 00:25:00,112
The Value of Royal Jelly

297
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:02,414
with Further Comments

298
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:05,016
on the Potential Health Benefits
of Prickly Ash.

299
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:08,452
- What's that?
- Prickly ash, hmm?

300
00:25:09,387 --> 00:25:11,554
Well, in Japanese,<i> hire sansho</i>

301
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:15,457
is the common word
for<i> zanthoxylum piperitum.</i>

302
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,560
It's used to treat
various degenerative diseases.

303
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:24,797
Anaemia, circulatory
conditions... arthritis and...

304
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,567
Hmm. What's it called?

305
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:30,468
Oh. Senility.

306
00:25:32,737 --> 00:25:34,404
That was a witticism.

307
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:41,844
The newest research suggests
that prickly ash

308
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:44,980
has far more promise
than royal jelly.

309
00:25:44,982 --> 00:25:47,816
Henceforth, prickly ash
is all that we should use.

310
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:50,138
Have you written more
about the man and his wife?

311
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:53,254
- All in good time.
- Is it real?

312
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:56,069
Of course.
Fiction is worthless!

313
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,757
The place you stopped.

314
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,919
Why do you want to know
the wife's perfume?

315
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:06,731
- Cameo Rose, is it?
- Yes.

316
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,841
Always leaves a trace.

317
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:43,118
Madame Schirmer.

318
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:46,634
Madame Schirmer, this is
Thomas Kelmot. Let me in.

319
00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:48,087
Madame Schirmer!

320
00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:51,289
<i>Herr</i> Kelmot, I did warn!

321
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,724
You come,
I call the Metropolitan Police!

322
00:27:53,726 --> 00:27:55,726
Madame,
my friend's emotional state

323
00:27:55,728 --> 00:27:58,161
is such that, if denied entry,

324
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:01,563
he might not be able
to restrain his passions.

325
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:04,066
Allow us both in, and
I will take full responsibility.

326
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:06,701
- Thank you so much.
- Who is this?

327
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:10,937
- This gentleman is a detective.
- <i>Ja?</i> His badge, please?

328
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,738
His name
is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

329
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,973
You don't mind if I close
this, do you? Such a draught.

330
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:21,877
No. I have seen Sherlock
Holmes in the magazines.

331
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:24,980
With the hat and the pipe.
It was never this person.

332
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:27,315
Madame Schirmer,
I saw Ann enter this place,

333
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:28,716
I demand you produce her.

334
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:31,218
Your wife is not here.

335
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,654
- You said that last time.
- You question my truth?

336
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:41,293
Oswald, my dear,
it is a wish to know

337
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,295
if you are this man's wife.

338
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:46,631
- No.
- You could be in disguise.

339
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,479
- I don't think so.
- <i>Voilà!</i>

340
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:57,638
It is, I believe, what
the English call a water closet.

341
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,841
She was here! I saw her!

342
00:29:00,843 --> 00:29:04,244
Mr. Kelmot, if you insist
on following your wife

343
00:29:04,246 --> 00:29:06,366
when you have employed me
to do the same,

344
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:10,482
one or the other of us will
find himself made redundant.

345
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,524
- He is distraught.
- He is a fool.

346
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:27,129
The armonica
used to be thought of

347
00:29:27,131 --> 00:29:29,164
as an instrument
of the black arts,

348
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:32,767
said to be used
to call for the dead.

349
00:29:36,104 --> 00:29:39,272
Something to do
with the nature of the glasses.

350
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:42,468
You don't believe that,
surely?

351
00:29:43,142 --> 00:29:45,143
What I believe
plays no part in this matter.

352
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:47,612
When was Mrs. Kelmot last here?

353
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:49,613
Weeks now.

354
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:52,182
Then the receipts
you posted to her address

355
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:53,550
were for Oswald's lessons.

356
00:29:55,185 --> 00:29:58,053
Mrs. Kelmot is paying for them.

357
00:29:59,455 --> 00:30:03,023
<i>Frau</i> Kelmot is passionate,
but an amateur.

358
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:06,138
She knew it was Oswald
who has the gift.

359
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,761
- You knew she was not here.
- Of course.

360
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:11,802
Oswald doesn't wear her scent.

361
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:16,699
You are still not
Sherlock Holmes!

362
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:34,549
How considerate.

363
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:37,951
You waited for me.

364
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:04,176
What are you doing?

365
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:06,344
Trying to see
if I can tell where I've been.

366
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:07,978
Don't you know?

367
00:31:09,013 --> 00:31:09,879
Mr. Holmes
can tell things like that

368
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,180
just from looking at a person.

369
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,750
- Where are you off to?
- See to the bees!

370
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:17,712
You'll eat
your breakfast first!

371
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:27,179
Got a letter from your aunt
the other day.

372
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:29,294
She says there's a couple
in Portsmouth

373
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:30,495
opening a hotel there.

374
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:32,563
Need a housekeeper.

375
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:34,398
Why would we want
to live in Portsmouth?

376
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,199
- Can't stay here forever.
- Why not?

377
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,768
- Because we can't.
- What's in Portsmouth?

378
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:40,435
This couple are opening
a hotel there...

379
00:31:40,437 --> 00:31:41,536
You said that.

380
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:44,471
You'll leave the table when
you're finished and not before.

381
00:31:44,473 --> 00:31:45,705
I'm not finished.

382
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:54,680
You don't eat
that Japanese muck.

383
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:56,681
It's<i> hire sansho.</i>

384
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,953
I know you like working

385
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,421
with the hive...
- It's an apiary.

386
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,889
And you like
being given responsibility,

387
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,724
but I shouldn't get too close.

388
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,459
- Bees don't bite.
- I don't mean the bees.

389
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:14,647
Mr. Holmes
won't be here forever.

390
00:32:16,063 --> 00:32:19,465
Your aunt says this hotel
might even take you on.

391
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:23,234
- They got porters and...
- Have porters.

392
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,403
Finished.

393
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:41,583
<i>Chemist delivered your things.</i>

394
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,585
Shall I have Roger
open the crate?

395
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,988
No. I'll see to it
when I'm finished.

396
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,189
Yes, sir.

397
00:32:51,826 --> 00:32:52,992
Sir?

398
00:32:56,096 --> 00:32:58,564
I know Roger's been
a help to you. He's a good boy.

399
00:32:59,365 --> 00:33:00,798
He's always been clever.

400
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,933
His dad and I
weren't the sort to know

401
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:05,135
the things a boy like Roger
takes interest in.

402
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,202
Exceptional children

403
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:10,505
are often the product
of unremarkable parents.

404
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:16,343
I've got a sister.
She lives in Portsmouth.

405
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:20,365
A couple of her acquaintants are
opening a private hotel there,

406
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:22,968
say they're willing
to take Roger and me on.

407
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:24,515
You have a sister?

408
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,617
Never would have thought it.

409
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:31,486
Is this a matter of wages?

410
00:33:31,787 --> 00:33:32,987
No.

411
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:40,059
Hmm.

412
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,695
I shall take this
under advisement.

413
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,200
My mother was sad
to see you leave.

414
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:24,163
I'm rather sorry now
I didn't bring the deerstalker.

415
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:25,964
You said you never wore one.

416
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:28,099
Well, yes,
but it would've pleased her.

417
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,334
She wanted the fictional.
You are the real.

418
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,222
Well,
I'm not sure that's true.

419
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:37,672
I think I was real once
until John made me into fiction.

420
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:39,754
And then after that,
I had little choice.

421
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:42,542
Play the part
as he'd fashioned it,

422
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:44,176
or become its contradiction.

423
00:34:45,778 --> 00:34:47,445
I'm actually quite fond
of a pipe,

424
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:49,847
but to smoke it,
especially in public,

425
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:55,952
after it became so well known
a prop, seemed vulgar.

426
00:34:55,954 --> 00:34:58,954
So, Dr. Watson's imagination
changed you?

427
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:02,142
I've never had much use
for imagination.

428
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:05,792
I prefer facts.

429
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:32,150
My father
would bring me here as a child.

430
00:35:32,152 --> 00:35:34,452
It was designed as a miniature.

431
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,987
We walk as giants.

432
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:44,293
The stones represent the lives
of those he has lost.

433
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:00,941
Oh...

434
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:02,142
Sherlock-san!

435
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:13,752
- <i>Hire sansho?</i>
- Prickly ash.

436
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:44,981
- Mr. Holmes.
- Hmm?

437
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:47,062
Too late to check on the bees?

438
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,949
Not in the least.

439
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:52,451
Bee check!

440
00:37:06,263 --> 00:37:07,943
- They're quiet.
- Yes.

441
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:12,886
What happens
when the bees die?

442
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,229
Is this
a metaphysical question?

443
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:17,936
I mean, do you mourn them?

444
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,404
Oh, I can't say that I've ever
mourned the dead,

445
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,505
bees or otherwise.

446
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:24,640
I concentrate on circumstances.

447
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,509
How did it die?
Who was responsible?

448
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:31,045
Death, grieving, mourning,

449
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,012
they're all commonplace.

450
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:35,213
Logic is rare, and so...

451
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,583
I dwell on logic.

452
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:45,054
Well, thank you, kind sir.

453
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:47,755
Night, bees.

454
00:37:47,757 --> 00:37:48,989
Sweet dreams, bees.

455
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:56,228
Now, what do you say
we go for a dip tomorrow?

456
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:58,609
- In the sea?
- Yes.

457
00:37:58,997 --> 00:37:59,763
It'll be brisk.

458
00:37:59,765 --> 00:38:01,097
Good for the blood!

459
00:38:01,965 --> 00:38:03,165
All right, then.

460
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:08,269
What sort of books
do you like, hmm?

461
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:14,174
Apart from Dr. Watson's stories
and books about bees.

462
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:17,102
Those are
all the books I have.

463
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:20,044
Well, there's a perfectly good
library right here, inside.

464
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,179
You can take any book you like.

465
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:44,365
Mr. Holmes?

466
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,600
Are we going for our swim?

467
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,706
I've already seen to the apiary.

468
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:58,609
Are you all right?

469
00:38:59,577 --> 00:39:01,144
I'm perfectly...

470
00:39:02,012 --> 00:39:03,212
I'm quite...

471
00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:05,447
Perfectly fine.

472
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:14,989
All right, Roger.

473
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,060
You go along. I'll catch you up.

474
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,075
Roger! Come along
or we'll lose the day.

475
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,120
Well done.

476
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:03,929
The photograph is her,
isn't it?

477
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,697
The woman in the story.

478
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,199
Yes.

479
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:10,681
Is she why you're writing it?

480
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:13,602
I wouldn't say
I was writing it...

481
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,230
It's more I'm trying
to remember it.

482
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,506
Ah, thank you.

483
00:40:19,574 --> 00:40:23,276
A few months ago,
my brother Mycroft died.

484
00:40:24,878 --> 00:40:27,179
<i>His club, the Diogenes,</i>

485
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:31,482
<i>asked that I go up to London
to retrieve his things.</i>

486
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:42,024
<i>I was given a small chest
containing the Watson stories,</i>

487
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,412
<i>none of which
I'd ever actually read.</i>

488
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,129
<i>They were as John
always described them,</i>

489
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,665
<i>penny dreadfuls
with an elevated prose style.</i>

490
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:57,368
<i>But one of the titles
piqued my interest.</i>

491
00:40:58,203 --> 00:40:59,770
<i>The story was familiar,</i>

492
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:02,004
<i>but its ending felt very,
very wrong.</i>

493
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:07,842
<i>I'd not seen any of
the cinematic depictions.</i>

494
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:11,111
<i>But by a fortunate chance,
an opportunity soon arose.</i>

495
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:16,415
<i>It's strange to see a semblance
of one's self 40 feet high...</i>

496
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,684
<i>- I fear for my Ann's sanity.
- Fear for her sanity?</i>

497
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:23,932
<i>Dear man,
you should fear for your life.</i>

498
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:26,254
<i>Whatever do you mean?</i>

499
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,025
<i>Murder, Mr. Kelmot. Murder.</i>

500
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:34,192
<i>...and played</i>

501
00:41:34,194 --> 00:41:35,359
<i>as a character out of pantomime.</i>

502
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:37,527
<i>Poisoned?</i>

503
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,262
<i>With what means have I?</i>

504
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:41,564
<i>Your armonica,
Madame Schirmer.</i>

505
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,401
<i>- Preposterous!
- Or rather, the glasses.</i>

506
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,436
<i>It is the lead in the crystal
that creates the unique tone.</i>

507
00:41:50,805 --> 00:41:52,539
<i>Absorbed into the blood
through the skin,</i>

508
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:55,541
<i>small exposure can produce
confusion, hallucinations.</i>

509
00:41:57,076 --> 00:42:02,113
<i>But constant, obsessive contact
can end in insanity and death.</i>

510
00:42:03,582 --> 00:42:04,381
<i>Every plot twist
came with a twirl</i>

511
00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:05,749
<i>of a moustache</i>

512
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:07,791
<i>and ended
in an exclamation mark.</i>

513
00:42:10,054 --> 00:42:12,522
<i>Our
would-be murderer is ingenious.</i>

514
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:15,424
<i>Surely you're not
referring to...</i>

515
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:17,325
<i>I'm afraid, Mrs. Kelmot,
you will have to find yourself</i>

516
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:18,447
<i>a new music teacher.</i>

517
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,296
<i>Oh.</i>

518
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:43,681
<i>Absolute rubbish!</i>

519
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:46,082
What possible motive

520
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:48,684
could that German woman
have had to kill Ann?

521
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:52,587
That night
I searched for something

522
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:55,489
to jog my memory
of the actual case.

523
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,995
<i>And there it was...
Her picture.</i>

524
00:43:04,664 --> 00:43:07,632
You know, a few years ago,
I could have told you everything

525
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:09,634
about the woman
in that photograph.

526
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:12,368
Certainly I'd recall
what had become of her,

527
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,703
whether she was victim
or culprit.

528
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:16,704
But that night...

529
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,241
I couldn't remember any of it.

530
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:25,812
All I knew for certain
was that the case was my last

531
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:28,281
and it was why
I left the profession,

532
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,815
came down here,

533
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:32,183
retired to my bees.

534
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:38,254
So, I decided to
write the story down on paper

535
00:43:39,122 --> 00:43:42,957
as it was, not as John made it.

536
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:45,292
Get it right before I die.

537
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:47,794
You're not going to die.

538
00:43:47,796 --> 00:43:48,861
Roger.

539
00:43:50,363 --> 00:43:51,529
I'm 93.

540
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,784
I had a great uncle
who lived to be 102.

541
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,492
Well, then,
that seals my fate.

542
00:43:57,833 --> 00:43:59,233
What are the odds
that you would know

543
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:01,155
two men who would live
that long?

544
00:44:01,802 --> 00:44:04,569
Well, I didn't
actually know him.

545
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,043
I'll see to the bees.

546
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:22,349
Ow! Mr. Holmes!

547
00:44:22,351 --> 00:44:23,450
Mr. Holmes!

548
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:25,551
Aargh. Aargh.

549
00:44:26,753 --> 00:44:28,386
I've been stung.

550
00:44:29,654 --> 00:44:32,822
Unlike the wasp,
the bee always leaves its sting.

551
00:44:33,824 --> 00:44:35,224
I must have done

552
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:36,658
something stupid.
- Oh, no.

553
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,961
Sometimes...
there's no reason at all.

554
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,064
Right.
Salt water, you drink that.

555
00:44:46,232 --> 00:44:50,100
Or onion juice
to prevent serious consequences.

556
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:54,737
And no need to tell your mother
about all this.

557
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,699
We don't want to worry her,
do we?

558
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
You going to go back
to the story?

559
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:01,608
Is that the price
for your silence?

560
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,142
Tight lips.

561
00:45:54,723 --> 00:45:58,158
How considerate.
You waited for me.

562
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:23,583
Good afternoon.

563
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:26,285
- Sir?
- Tea for one in the window.

564
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:27,719
Certainly, sir. Mind the step.

565
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:44,802
Ill, do you say?

566
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:47,284
Took all the strength he had
just to write out the cheque.

567
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,286
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

568
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:13,694
Well, here we are.

569
00:47:16,297 --> 00:47:18,665
- Have you used this before?
- No. I haven't.

570
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:23,369
It is highly poisonous.
A drop will more than suffice.

571
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:24,470
Thank you.

572
00:47:43,521 --> 00:47:45,555
It's just Thomas
is in such a state.

573
00:47:45,557 --> 00:47:47,523
He insisted I made certain.

574
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:49,224
Reassure Mr. Kelmot

575
00:47:50,392 --> 00:47:51,892
that the particulars of the will
have not changed

576
00:47:51,894 --> 00:47:53,059
since he dictated them.

577
00:47:54,494 --> 00:47:56,814
Your possessions are bequeathed
to him, as his are to you.

578
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,307
Thank you so much.
It was so good to see you.

579
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,210
- Excuse me.
- Yes, miss?

580
00:48:15,212 --> 00:48:16,844
Is the 8:10 the fast service?

581
00:48:16,846 --> 00:48:19,006
The 8:10's the slow one,
makes local stops.

582
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:20,980
And the 9:05?

583
00:48:22,182 --> 00:48:23,515
That's the fast train,
goes right on through.

584
00:48:23,517 --> 00:48:25,317
- All aboard!
- Thank you.

585
00:48:25,885 --> 00:48:27,352
All aboard.

586
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:44,752
Honeybees
are attracted to you.

587
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:49,262
It's the scent. Cameo Rose.

588
00:49:50,264 --> 00:49:52,531
- Oh.
- She thinks you're a flower.

589
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:57,234
Must confuse
the little thing no end.

590
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,370
May I?

591
00:50:01,638 --> 00:50:02,771
Oh.

592
00:50:04,273 --> 00:50:05,373
Very kind.

593
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,144
Ah. The iris.
Amazing resilience.

594
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:13,546
Enough light and they will grow

595
00:50:13,548 --> 00:50:14,947
in the most
uninhabitable regions,

596
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:17,548
desert, cold, rock.

597
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,717
Why do you suppose it is

598
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,079
that something as small
and insignificant as the iris

599
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,593
should be so much stronger
than we are?

600
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,569
Perhaps they're less affected
by what goes on around them.

601
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:31,391
Hmm.

602
00:50:32,426 --> 00:50:35,527
- Are you a botanist?
- Amateur only.

603
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:38,462
I am, by disposition,
a hobbyist.

604
00:50:39,597 --> 00:50:42,732
In fact, if I may,
there is one particular

605
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:45,634
hobby of mine
that might amuse you.

606
00:50:48,938 --> 00:50:50,305
I can see the future.

607
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,343
Shall I read your palm?

608
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,812
I promise
I'll find nothing dreadful.

609
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,553
What about our friend?

610
00:51:18,197 --> 00:51:19,330
Oh.

611
00:51:23,434 --> 00:51:24,500
Oh.

612
00:51:32,975 --> 00:51:35,009
Hmm. Hmm.

613
00:51:41,149 --> 00:51:42,516
Your parents are gone.

614
00:51:44,218 --> 00:51:48,387
Your mother long ago,
your father more recently.

615
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:51,569
You had love in your heart
for someone...

616
00:51:52,624 --> 00:51:56,026
No, for more than one person.

617
00:51:57,128 --> 00:51:59,162
But they have left you,

618
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:02,931
and your love for them
has nowhere to go.

619
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:05,399
You're in pain.

620
00:52:06,734 --> 00:52:09,094
But you must not allow your pain
to guide your actions.

621
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:14,639
Where that leads...
The lines are not so distinct.

622
00:52:15,407 --> 00:52:17,241
- Why?
- I beg your pardon?

623
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:18,875
You see so much.

624
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:22,811
Why can't you see
what happens next?

625
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:25,526
- The lines...
- Yes, you said.

626
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:34,254
Ply your parlour tricks
elsewhere, Mr. Holmes.

627
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:41,560
Wait.

628
00:52:50,936 --> 00:52:52,069
I can't...

629
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,773
I can't remember.

630
00:53:50,323 --> 00:53:52,490
Mum! Mum!

631
00:54:00,264 --> 00:54:01,530
Mr. Holmes!

632
00:54:15,442 --> 00:54:16,775
Was it the smoke
knocked him out?

633
00:54:16,777 --> 00:54:18,009
Could have done.

634
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:20,310
Most likely he stood up
too quickly

635
00:54:20,312 --> 00:54:21,432
and lost consciousness.

636
00:54:21,945 --> 00:54:23,065
It isn't the first time.

637
00:54:24,113 --> 00:54:26,233
The last housekeeper
didn't know what to do.

638
00:54:30,785 --> 00:54:33,553
He must have decided
to take it subcutaneously.

639
00:55:14,027 --> 00:55:15,360
Well, now we can't leave.

640
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:18,563
No.
Made sure of that, didn't he?

641
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:36,243
Where's the<i> hire sansho?</i>

642
00:55:38,379 --> 00:55:39,846
The prickly ash.

643
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:41,968
If it's not there,
I'm sure I don't know.

644
00:55:42,682 --> 00:55:45,250
- Did you throw it out?
- Why would I do that?

645
00:55:46,018 --> 00:55:47,151
For spite and malice.

646
00:55:50,522 --> 00:55:52,089
Where'd you get words
like that?

647
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:53,824
The dictionary.

648
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:56,325
Like as not,
he took the muck himself.

649
00:55:56,327 --> 00:55:58,026
Got burnt up
with the rest of it.

650
00:55:58,028 --> 00:55:59,188
Those can go on the fire.

651
00:56:00,228 --> 00:56:02,228
Did Mr. Holmes say
you were to do this?

652
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:04,897
He always disposes
of that sort.

653
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:06,832
How do you know
what sort these are?

654
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:08,500
You want to know
who writes to him?

655
00:56:08,502 --> 00:56:10,822
Pensioners who think
they've solved Jack the Ripper.

656
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:13,103
Widows who've lost their cats

657
00:56:13,105 --> 00:56:15,585
and just know he's the only
man on Earth who can find them.

658
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,412
He's the last resort
for every lunatic out there.

659
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:20,507
- It's not your decision.
- It is...

660
00:56:20,575 --> 00:56:22,242
If I'm to be a full-bore
medical staff at cook's wages.

661
00:56:22,244 --> 00:56:25,712
He's an invalid. Needs a nurse,
not a housekeeper.

662
00:56:25,714 --> 00:56:27,246
All he did was took a fall.

663
00:56:27,248 --> 00:56:28,547
Your granddad
was hale and hearty

664
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:30,115
60 summers then he took a fall.

665
00:56:30,117 --> 00:56:32,157
It was three weeks
to the day he died.

666
00:56:33,218 --> 00:56:35,499
Should be in hospital.
That or one of them places.

667
00:56:35,686 --> 00:56:37,386
He'll get better!

668
00:56:37,388 --> 00:56:39,488
And the day he does
is the day we go.

669
00:56:39,956 --> 00:56:40,956
Is that clear?

670
00:57:01,974 --> 00:57:03,274
Hmm.

671
00:57:05,043 --> 00:57:06,977
- Oh.
- Got a letter from Japan.

672
00:57:08,112 --> 00:57:09,612
It's from Mr. Umezaki.

673
00:57:11,715 --> 00:57:14,683
- Have you read it?
- No. Wanted to.

674
00:57:15,618 --> 00:57:17,952
Sin of desire.
You're a Catholic.

675
00:57:30,465 --> 00:57:32,599
Mum says you throw out
most of the letters you get.

676
00:57:32,601 --> 00:57:34,100
And why do you think that is?

677
00:57:34,102 --> 00:57:36,342
The people who write
want you to solve things.

678
00:57:37,337 --> 00:57:38,503
If you read their letters,
you'd want to help.

679
00:57:38,505 --> 00:57:41,372
Oh, no.
You give me too much credit.

680
00:57:42,307 --> 00:57:43,941
It's just
if I were to read them,

681
00:57:43,943 --> 00:57:45,842
I'd feel obliged to respond.

682
00:57:47,377 --> 00:57:50,178
Perhaps Mr. Umezaki's
asking you to go back to Japan.

683
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,815
Oh.
I'll never go back to Japan.

684
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,151
- Why not?
- Long journey, old man.

685
00:57:59,353 --> 00:58:01,987
- You made it before.
- That was before.

686
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,871
Maybe you could get
more prickly ash.

687
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,892
The prickly ash hasn't made

688
00:58:09,894 --> 00:58:12,227
a bit of difference
to my memory,

689
00:58:12,229 --> 00:58:14,189
any more
than the royal jelly did.

690
00:58:14,863 --> 00:58:15,963
Yes.

691
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:18,865
The only inspiration

692
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:21,027
for any sort of recollections
has been you.

693
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,603
Go on. You open it.

694
00:58:26,705 --> 00:58:28,785
He's writing to say
his mother is dead.

695
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,745
How could you tell?

696
00:58:35,747 --> 00:58:38,314
Mr. Umezaki swore that
he would never contact me again.

697
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,416
The only thing that would
make him change his mind

698
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:44,018
would be a deathbed instruction
from his mother.

699
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,455
A good son always does
what his mother asks.

700
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:53,625
Mr. Holmes!

701
00:58:55,094 --> 00:58:56,828
You're not to be out of bed!

702
00:58:58,063 --> 00:59:00,164
Mrs. Munro,
I have counted the steps

703
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:03,500
from the bed to the window,
from the window to the...

704
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:05,969
You're not to do anything
on your own.

705
00:59:05,971 --> 00:59:07,070
You're to ring.

706
00:59:08,972 --> 00:59:10,572
I thought it was
an imposition.

707
00:59:10,574 --> 00:59:12,340
It will be an imposition
if you lose your bearings

708
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:14,308
and end up on the floor
for me to collect!

709
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,177
I hadn't realised
that this had become

710
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,477
an industrial dispute.

711
00:59:49,774 --> 00:59:52,175
I've been trying
to calculate the likelihood

712
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,311
that we should find<i> hire sansho</i>

713
00:59:55,313 --> 00:59:57,780
in a place
so utterly devoid of life.

714
00:59:57,782 --> 01:00:00,349
Perhaps it is life
reasserting itself.

715
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:05,887
<i>Hire sansho.</i>

716
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:16,963
How does it taste?

717
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:21,400
It isn't for the taste
that we sought it.

718
01:00:34,844 --> 01:00:36,678
Ah, now, before we leave,

719
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,414
there's something
that I mustn't forget.

720
01:00:40,749 --> 01:00:43,883
I've signed it,
as you requested.

721
01:00:44,184 --> 01:00:45,317
Oh.

722
01:00:46,552 --> 01:00:50,220
Not certain
you can read my scrawl.

723
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:56,892
"To Mr. Umezaki, who has not
owned this book for long."

724
01:00:58,027 --> 01:00:59,894
You haven't had this book
for 20 years.

725
01:00:59,896 --> 01:01:01,395
It came from the library.

726
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,364
The glue mark shows
where you removed

727
01:01:04,366 --> 01:01:05,431
the card jacket.

728
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:10,567
You know nothing about bees
or royal jelly or prickly ash.

729
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:12,735
Enough to bring you here.

730
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,738
During our correspondence
over the last few months...

731
01:01:17,873 --> 01:01:19,907
was my name not familiar to you?

732
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,242
- No.
- My father's, then?

733
01:01:22,943 --> 01:01:24,410
Masuo Umezaki?

734
01:01:25,178 --> 01:01:26,545
I never knew your father.

735
01:01:26,547 --> 01:01:28,647
He was a diplomat in London,
years ago.

736
01:01:30,016 --> 01:01:32,083
He loved all things English.

737
01:01:33,785 --> 01:01:36,586
The first gift he gave to me
was a cricket bat.

738
01:01:38,355 --> 01:01:40,189
The second was this.

739
01:01:41,558 --> 01:01:46,261
In English,
so as to "assist my education."

740
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:01,741
"After consulting

741
01:02:01,743 --> 01:02:03,943
"with the very great
detective Sherlock Holmes,

742
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:07,745
"I realise it's in the best
interests of us all

743
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:10,280
"that I remain
in England indefinitely.

744
01:02:11,048 --> 01:02:12,815
"You will see from this book

745
01:02:12,817 --> 01:02:15,717
"that he is a very wise
and intelligent man,

746
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:18,986
and that his say in this matter
should not be taken lightly."

747
01:02:20,054 --> 01:02:21,888
We never heard from him again.

748
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:25,224
- I'm sorry.
- My mother is dying.

749
01:02:26,593 --> 01:02:29,794
She grew old without a husband.
All because of you.

750
01:02:37,235 --> 01:02:38,335
I understand.

751
01:02:39,437 --> 01:02:41,237
The last time
you heard from your father

752
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:43,505
was the first time
you heard about me.

753
01:02:44,406 --> 01:02:47,107
Masuo vanished from your life

754
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:50,309
and I arrived...
in the form of a book.

755
01:02:51,311 --> 01:02:53,311
One replaced the other,
as it were.

756
01:02:55,114 --> 01:02:57,281
I suggest you and your mother
take whatever time you have

757
01:02:57,283 --> 01:02:59,816
to come to terms
with the facts of the case.

758
01:03:01,151 --> 01:03:04,052
A man abandoned his family
and wrote his son a story.

759
01:03:05,421 --> 01:03:06,954
He wouldn't be the first

760
01:03:06,956 --> 01:03:09,356
to cloak his cowardice
in a flag of sacrifice.

761
01:03:13,593 --> 01:03:14,593
I'm sorry.

762
01:03:17,696 --> 01:03:19,496
But I never knew your father.

763
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:29,838
I shall not bother you
any longer with my questions.

764
01:03:31,173 --> 01:03:35,109
But if the prickly ash succeeds,
you will let me know?

765
01:04:03,671 --> 01:04:04,971
Aargh, argh!

766
01:04:04,973 --> 01:04:06,639
Aargh!

767
01:04:10,043 --> 01:04:12,411
Help.

768
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:13,712
Help.

769
01:04:21,353 --> 01:04:22,486
Thank you.

770
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:25,322
I look like I've been attacked

771
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:27,423
by the Hound
of the Baskervilles.

772
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:30,492
Can't let Mum

773
01:04:30,494 --> 01:04:32,560
see you wearing that top.
- No.

774
01:04:32,562 --> 01:04:34,595
- It's evidence.
- Yes.

775
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,364
What of? A murder?

776
01:04:40,834 --> 01:04:43,669
Oh... I've something for you.

777
01:04:47,339 --> 01:04:48,439
No.

778
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:53,943
<i>Apis cerana japonica.</i>

779
01:04:55,578 --> 01:04:58,513
- They have bees in Japan?
- Yes. Just like our bees.

780
01:04:58,515 --> 01:04:59,914
Only they're Japanese.

781
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:03,083
No, it's for you. It's a gift.

782
01:05:04,051 --> 01:05:06,352
Oh. Thank you.

783
01:05:06,354 --> 01:05:08,520
<i>Arigato,</i> as they say in Japan.

784
01:05:13,525 --> 01:05:15,125
Something the matter?

785
01:05:18,363 --> 01:05:20,363
You lost
another dozen bees today.

786
01:05:21,065 --> 01:05:23,065
- A dozen?
- What do you think it is?

787
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,367
An outbreak of mortality.

788
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:29,671
Could be a disease
we've not seen before,

789
01:05:29,673 --> 01:05:31,439
or a sudden mutation.

790
01:05:32,707 --> 01:05:34,988
You bring up some corpses
and we'll examine them.

791
01:05:35,676 --> 01:05:38,310
- Yes, sir!
- And my glass.

792
01:05:39,345 --> 01:05:41,385
Study.
Should be in one of the drawers.

793
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:26,689
Roger?

794
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:41,670
Roger?

795
01:06:51,046 --> 01:06:54,714
- Mr. Holmes feels better today.
- Is that so?

796
01:06:55,215 --> 01:06:56,315
Hmm.

797
01:06:57,283 --> 01:06:59,217
Mr. Holmes
feels so much better,

798
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:01,285
we're about to start
an investigation.

799
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:04,154
Of what?

800
01:07:04,156 --> 01:07:06,289
The crime wave
that has done away

801
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:09,291
with a number of our apiary's
most prominent residents.

802
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:14,194
Well. If you need suspects,
you know where to find me.

803
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:16,195
Mum, wait.

804
01:07:17,564 --> 01:07:20,231
I bet if we asked, Mr. Holmes
would... do his thing.

805
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,500
The thing he does
where he tells people

806
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:25,862
who they are and where
they've been, just from looking.

807
01:07:27,404 --> 01:07:28,604
Do Mum for her.

808
01:07:28,606 --> 01:07:30,005
I'm sure your mother

809
01:07:30,007 --> 01:07:32,307
doesn't need to be told
where she's been.

810
01:07:33,609 --> 01:07:35,142
Let's not bother Mr. Holmes
with any foolishness.

811
01:07:35,144 --> 01:07:37,010
It's not foolishness. Here.

812
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:41,647
You come and stand in front
of Mr. Holmes. Just like that.

813
01:07:42,682 --> 01:07:44,722
And he will tell you
where you've been.

814
01:07:46,585 --> 01:07:47,685
Do it.

815
01:07:49,654 --> 01:07:51,488
You want her
to turn in a circle?

816
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,223
No, that won't be necessary.

817
01:07:54,024 --> 01:07:55,157
Turn in a circle.

818
01:08:19,214 --> 01:08:21,174
You've been away
most of the day.

819
01:08:21,482 --> 01:08:22,882
The soot on your dress attests

820
01:08:22,884 --> 01:08:25,217
that you went by train
to Portsmouth,

821
01:08:26,619 --> 01:08:28,979
as all other nearby rail lines
which might accommodate

822
01:08:30,155 --> 01:08:33,523
a return trip of this length
are under repair or beyond it.

823
01:08:34,858 --> 01:08:37,226
In Portsmouth, you met
the couple who run the hotel.

824
01:08:38,628 --> 01:08:40,495
Your hair and nails are evidence
that you wished to make

825
01:08:40,497 --> 01:08:42,063
a favourable impression.

826
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:45,171
They made you an offer,
you accepted.

827
01:08:45,332 --> 01:08:47,492
You declined tea,
and did not see the sister

828
01:08:48,034 --> 01:08:49,401
for whom you have
no particular fondness,

829
01:08:49,403 --> 01:08:54,572
using my indisposition
as an excuse to hurry back.

830
01:08:55,874 --> 01:08:58,442
- It wasn't an excuse.
- You accepted?

831
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:02,712
Start a week Monday.

832
01:09:04,081 --> 01:09:05,214
Both of us?

833
01:09:06,182 --> 01:09:07,182
- We're both going.
- She wants me

834
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:08,184
to be a bootblack!

835
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:09,916
Roger!

836
01:09:09,918 --> 01:09:11,878
She wants me
to do what she does!

837
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:13,885
There is no shame
in what I do!

838
01:09:13,887 --> 01:09:15,553
You complain enough about it!
Always going on

839
01:09:15,555 --> 01:09:17,855
about how hard things are.
And you wish you had it better!

840
01:09:17,857 --> 01:09:19,857
She can barely read!

841
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:30,666
Go after her.

842
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,402
Apologise for saying things
that were meant to hurt.

843
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,603
You were cruel!

844
01:09:37,771 --> 01:09:40,772
If you don't apologise,
you will regret it.

845
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,674
- People always say that.
- Because it's true.

846
01:09:43,676 --> 01:09:46,043
<i>Moi, je regrette tellement.</i>

847
01:09:46,045 --> 01:09:49,246
- You regret...
- So much!

848
01:10:11,201 --> 01:10:13,321
Your dad hated
what he did for a living.

849
01:10:14,404 --> 01:10:16,638
Mechanic in a garage,
like his dad before him.

850
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,874
When he got called up,
he said to me,

851
01:10:19,876 --> 01:10:21,542
"My love,
I'll not spend this war

852
01:10:21,544 --> 01:10:23,710
"underneath the oil pan
of some toff's jeep.

853
01:10:24,745 --> 01:10:26,612
I'm gonna put in for the RAF."

854
01:10:28,114 --> 01:10:29,214
So he did.

855
01:10:30,783 --> 01:10:31,883
He trained.

856
01:10:33,485 --> 01:10:37,621
Scored high marks, got assigned
to a Bristol Blenheim, Mark IV.

857
01:10:38,623 --> 01:10:42,325
Blown out of the sky.
First time up.

858
01:10:45,629 --> 01:10:47,730
All his mates
who worked the motor pool

859
01:10:47,732 --> 01:10:49,131
came home without a scratch.

860
01:10:51,434 --> 01:10:53,434
I shouldn't have said
what I said.

861
01:10:55,436 --> 01:10:56,636
Lesson there, then.

862
01:10:58,171 --> 01:10:59,571
Don't say everything you think.

863
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:16,518
Look.

864
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:25,558
- How did you find that?
- In your desk.

865
01:11:28,094 --> 01:11:30,662
- Couldn't have.
- The one in the corner.

866
01:11:31,797 --> 01:11:33,297
Didn't know it was a desk
until I opened it.

867
01:11:33,299 --> 01:11:36,266
Oh, that's not my desk,
it's John's.

868
01:11:36,268 --> 01:11:39,534
He left it at Baker Street
when he went off to get married.

869
01:11:40,669 --> 01:11:42,503
Yes, and there's
a secret compartment

870
01:11:42,505 --> 01:11:44,825
containing the very glove
you've been writing about.

871
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:47,640
I know you say Dr. Watson
didn't always

872
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:49,108
get things right,
but in the story...

873
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,110
I am not working
on that story anymore.

874
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:54,179
Yes, but in Watson's story,
he does have the armonica in it.

875
01:11:54,181 --> 01:11:56,181
And the German lady.
And that glove.

876
01:11:56,982 --> 01:11:57,781
So maybe
he did get things right.

877
01:11:57,783 --> 01:11:59,482
No, that's not possible.

878
01:11:59,484 --> 01:12:01,217
John had gone
from Baker Street by then.

879
01:12:01,219 --> 01:12:02,785
Well, then why was it
in there?

880
01:12:02,787 --> 01:12:04,019
I don't know!

881
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:07,241
And if I ever did know,
I don't remember.

882
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,789
If you can't remember,

883
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,223
then why couldn't the case
have been a success

884
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:12,959
like Dr. Watson wrote it?
- Because it was my last case.

885
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:15,328
And if I'd brought it
to a successful conclusion,

886
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,196
I wouldn't have left
the profession

887
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:21,567
and spent 35 years here, in
this place, away from the world!

888
01:12:27,373 --> 01:12:30,808
I chose exile for my punishment,
but what was it for?

889
01:12:31,976 --> 01:12:34,136
I must have done something
terribly wrong...

890
01:12:34,978 --> 01:12:37,145
And I've no evidence
of what it was.

891
01:12:37,746 --> 01:12:40,647
Only pain, guilt...

892
01:12:41,415 --> 01:12:44,083
Useless, worthless feelings!

893
01:12:45,385 --> 01:12:49,153
I wish to God I'd never even
taken Umezaki's case!

894
01:12:50,522 --> 01:12:52,756
- Kelmot's.
- What?

895
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:56,759
Kelmot's case.
You said Umezaki.

896
01:13:00,897 --> 01:13:04,299
Roger. Tea's ready.

897
01:13:12,574 --> 01:13:14,074
Best clear this up.

898
01:13:27,254 --> 01:13:30,823
Mr. Holmes.
Would you like your tea now?

899
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:41,365
Mr. Holmes?

900
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:49,706
If you die...
what'll happen to the bees?

901
01:13:53,343 --> 01:13:55,043
I haven't a clue.

902
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:02,249
One can't solve everything.

903
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:14,058
<i>Said to be used
to call for the dead.</i>

904
01:14:24,233 --> 01:14:26,634
<i>Death, mourning, grief...</i>

905
01:14:32,506 --> 01:14:34,006
<i>They're all commonplace.</i>

906
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,517
<i>Logic is rare.</i>

907
01:14:49,187 --> 01:14:51,588
The dead are not
so very far away.

908
01:14:52,723 --> 01:14:55,024
They're just on the other side
of the wall.

909
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:03,197
Now, whenever
did you say that?

910
01:15:15,376 --> 01:15:18,110
Ply your parlour tricks
elsewhere, Mr. Holmes.

911
01:15:19,745 --> 01:15:21,378
My husband could never succeed
at deception

912
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:23,279
so long as I do his laundry.

913
01:15:24,314 --> 01:15:25,874
I don't know much
about your profession,

914
01:15:25,948 --> 01:15:27,148
but I doubt predicting

915
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:28,215
the future of women
you're engaged to follow

916
01:15:28,217 --> 01:15:29,482
is common practice.

917
01:15:30,383 --> 01:15:32,150
It was intended only
as a means

918
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:33,352
to achieve a desired result.

919
01:15:34,253 --> 01:15:36,373
- That being what?
- To delay your actions.

920
01:15:36,421 --> 01:15:37,320
To keep you
from this appointment

921
01:15:37,322 --> 01:15:39,054
you seem so eager to make.

922
01:15:41,724 --> 01:15:43,684
Even before
I glimpsed you today,

923
01:15:44,258 --> 01:15:45,291
I'd gleaned some
of the passionate

924
01:15:45,293 --> 01:15:47,293
feelings you have
for your husband.

925
01:15:47,927 --> 01:15:50,047
The man who took away
the music you loved,

926
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,229
denied you the pleasures
of your lessons,

927
01:15:52,231 --> 01:15:54,631
even refused even
to mark a child's grave.

928
01:15:55,633 --> 01:15:57,633
All these predicted
your antipathy.

929
01:15:58,501 --> 01:16:00,461
And then I witnessed
your actions.

930
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:02,236
<i>Forging his signature,</i>

931
01:16:03,271 --> 01:16:04,971
<i>drawing down his account,</i>

932
01:16:06,306 --> 01:16:08,466
<i>purchasing poison,
consulting his will,</i>

933
01:16:09,108 --> 01:16:10,108
<i>planning an escape
with a mystery man</i>

934
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:11,390
<i>who was paid a handsome fee.</i>

935
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,177
And all for my benefit.

936
01:16:15,078 --> 01:16:16,445
A convincing set
of circumstances,

937
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:20,549
signalling your intention
to murder your husband.

938
01:16:24,686 --> 01:16:26,553
But for two errors.

939
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:33,392
We must place blame
on your husband for the first.

940
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:36,461
If Mr. Kelmot had not blundered

941
01:16:36,463 --> 01:16:38,383
into Madame Schirmer's
atelier...

942
01:16:38,963 --> 01:16:40,897
<i>and so taken me from my course,</i>

943
01:16:42,366 --> 01:16:43,833
<i>you wouldn't have had
to loiter on the street</i>

944
01:16:43,835 --> 01:16:46,202
<i>for such a suspiciously long
period of time.</i>

945
01:16:46,204 --> 01:16:49,171
<i>But you had no choice,
so loiter you did.</i>

946
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:52,440
I would also make
the observation

947
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,175
that there is nothing about you

948
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:56,777
that signifies the type of woman
who enjoys window shopping,

949
01:16:57,845 --> 01:17:00,012
especially the window
of a taxidermist.

950
01:17:01,447 --> 01:17:02,880
Was that the second error?

951
01:17:02,882 --> 01:17:05,048
No, merely confirmation
of the first.

952
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:08,517
The second was unavoidable,
and all the more damning.

953
01:17:09,185 --> 01:17:10,718
The man at the station.

954
01:17:11,352 --> 01:17:12,785
Everything about him,

955
01:17:12,787 --> 01:17:14,653
<i>his clothes,
the patches on his trousers,</i>

956
01:17:14,655 --> 01:17:18,622
<i>his hands,
scarred and burned with acid,</i>

957
01:17:18,624 --> 01:17:20,323
<i>announced his profession.</i>

958
01:17:20,325 --> 01:17:21,624
Stonemason.

959
01:17:26,295 --> 01:17:28,795
Money must have been
a dire necessity,

960
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:33,932
else you would never have forged
your husband's signature.

961
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,834
The money was to pay
for the headstones

962
01:17:36,836 --> 01:17:38,035
your husband would not allow.

963
01:17:38,037 --> 01:17:39,869
For Grace. For James.

964
01:17:41,638 --> 01:17:42,704
For you.

965
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:49,643
Was arranging things
to make it look

966
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:52,411
as if Mr. Kelmot
was the intended victim

967
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,645
simply to keep me off the trail?

968
01:17:57,848 --> 01:18:02,317
When I found the card...
I was furious.

969
01:18:03,986 --> 01:18:05,820
That Thomas
should know me so little

970
01:18:05,822 --> 01:18:09,322
that he had need to employ a
detective to uncover the truth.

971
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:11,923
Then it struck me,

972
01:18:13,091 --> 01:18:17,493
if anyone could understand,
it would be you.

973
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:23,397
Thomas thinks I'm mad
because I speak to my children.

974
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:26,299
He doesn't understand.

975
01:18:27,567 --> 01:18:30,901
The dead
are not so very far away.

976
01:18:33,571 --> 01:18:34,671
They're just...

977
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:38,808
on the other side of the wall.

978
01:18:41,678 --> 01:18:44,079
It's us, on this side,
who are, all of us so...

979
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,413
Alone?

980
01:18:50,852 --> 01:18:52,184
I have been alone...

981
01:18:55,054 --> 01:18:56,320
all my life.

982
01:18:58,222 --> 01:19:00,590
But with the compensations
of the intellect.

983
01:19:01,558 --> 01:19:04,459
- And is that enough?
- It can be.

984
01:19:07,396 --> 01:19:11,031
If one is so fortunate
as to find a place in the world.

985
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:16,935
And another soul with whom
one's loneliness can reside.

986
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:24,141
Do you know a place where
two such souls might reside?

987
01:19:34,117 --> 01:19:37,720
<i>It was an offer
unlike any I had ever received.</i>

988
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:41,889
<i>She wanted to share
her solitude with me.</i>

989
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:45,691
<i>It was only later I realised</i>

990
01:19:45,693 --> 01:19:48,393
<i>how fateful
my decision would be.</i>

991
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,167
You have a husband
who loves you.

992
01:20:01,238 --> 01:20:02,671
Go home to him.

993
01:20:38,772 --> 01:20:40,639
Mr. Holmes...

994
01:20:41,407 --> 01:20:42,774
You have my thanks.

995
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:46,310
What more, madam, could I do?

996
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:11,834
<i>She had poured out
the contents of the bottle</i>

997
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:14,269
<i>and,
with no malice aforethought,</i>

998
01:21:14,271 --> 01:21:16,638
<i>poisoned the innocent witness.</i>

999
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:22,242
<i>If it had been
one of John's stories,</i>

1000
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,444
<i>he would have called it
a foreshadowing.</i>

1001
01:21:45,129 --> 01:21:47,763
<i>Our time together was fleeting.</i>

1002
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:51,999
<i>Less than an hour, really.</i>

1003
01:21:57,104 --> 01:22:00,773
<i>Yet her death made me see
that human nature was a mystery</i>

1004
01:22:00,775 --> 01:22:03,208
<i>that logic alone
could not illuminate.</i>

1005
01:22:13,785 --> 01:22:16,853
<i>I had successfully deduced
the facts of her case,</i>

1006
01:22:16,855 --> 01:22:19,355
<i>but I had failed
to grasp their meaning.</i>

1007
01:22:21,324 --> 01:22:23,224
<i>Never had I felt</i>

1008
01:22:23,226 --> 01:22:26,227
<i>such an incomprehensible
emptiness within myself.</i>

1009
01:22:29,698 --> 01:22:32,666
<i>Only then did I begin
to understand</i>

1010
01:22:32,668 --> 01:22:34,934
<i>how utterly alone
I was in the world.</i>

1011
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,307
<i>Mrs. Hudson wrote to Watson.</i>

1012
01:22:43,975 --> 01:22:45,475
<i>He came at once.</i>

1013
01:22:47,144 --> 01:22:49,945
<i>He stayed with me, in our
old rooms, for a month more.</i>

1014
01:22:59,989 --> 01:23:03,591
<i>I told him about the case,
everything in great detail.</i>

1015
01:23:08,162 --> 01:23:10,202
<i>He brought me back
from the brink.</i>

1016
01:23:11,532 --> 01:23:14,834
<i>And then Watson wrote the story.</i>

1017
01:23:14,836 --> 01:23:16,168
<i>He made me the hero.</i>

1018
01:23:17,503 --> 01:23:19,663
<i>It was his way
of bestowing a kindness.</i>

1019
01:23:21,073 --> 01:23:22,773
<i>He knew no other manner</i>

1020
01:23:22,775 --> 01:23:25,509
<i>in which to write
the character he had created.</i>

1021
01:23:27,078 --> 01:23:31,080
<i>After all those years,
John didn't know me at all.</i>

1022
01:23:32,449 --> 01:23:34,649
<i>Why he took the glove
I can only surmise,</i>

1023
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:38,053
<i>was it to prevent it becoming
too powerful a reminder,</i>

1024
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:40,221
<i>to keep it from being
a well of sadness</i>

1025
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:42,289
<i>to which I might return?</i>

1026
01:23:43,624 --> 01:23:46,425
<i>But he could not bring himself
to destroy it either.</i>

1027
01:23:47,693 --> 01:23:49,853
<i>After that,
John and I were estranged.</i>

1028
01:23:50,695 --> 01:23:52,962
<i>Three years later,
he too was gone,</i>

1029
01:23:52,964 --> 01:23:55,631
<i>without us ever
having said goodbye.</i>

1030
01:24:11,948 --> 01:24:14,049
<i>And thus concludes
the true story</i>

1031
01:24:14,051 --> 01:24:16,885
<i>of a woman
who died before her time,</i>

1032
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,821
<i>and a man who, until recently,</i>

1033
01:24:19,823 --> 01:24:22,489
<i>was certain he had outlived his.</i>

1034
01:24:31,396 --> 01:24:33,029
Roger with the bees?

1035
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:35,063
Like as not.

1036
01:24:35,065 --> 01:24:37,065
Must tell him
something important.

1037
01:24:37,832 --> 01:24:40,113
You continue with
whatever it was you were doing.

1038
01:24:42,969 --> 01:24:45,570
You might ask him
where the watering can's got to!

1039
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:43,958
Ambulance?
Yes, this is Headly House.

1040
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,326
- <i>Headly?</i>
- Yes, quickly!

1041
01:25:45,328 --> 01:25:47,368
And bring some supplies
of adrenaline.

1042
01:25:48,529 --> 01:25:50,609
- <i>Headly House?</i>
- That's right, Headly!

1043
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:19,723
Roger?

1044
01:26:20,991 --> 01:26:22,124
Roger!

1045
01:26:23,226 --> 01:26:24,426
Roger?

1046
01:26:25,995 --> 01:26:29,931
Oh, Roger. Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1047
01:26:29,933 --> 01:26:31,799
Roger. Oh, Roger!

1048
01:26:55,521 --> 01:26:56,654
Mr. Holmes?

1049
01:26:59,057 --> 01:27:00,824
It's Inspector Gilbert.

1050
01:27:04,294 --> 01:27:05,494
Mr. Holmes?

1051
01:27:08,898 --> 01:27:10,465
Yes, Inspector?

1052
01:27:11,767 --> 01:27:13,901
They're giving the boy
injections of adrenaline,

1053
01:27:13,903 --> 01:27:15,469
as you said to, but...

1054
01:27:17,238 --> 01:27:18,438
he's not looking good.

1055
01:27:19,273 --> 01:27:21,373
He was fleeing his attackers.

1056
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:24,975
His footprints.

1057
01:27:26,377 --> 01:27:29,612
Their pattern shows that
his flight was disorientated.

1058
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,020
The swarm must have followed him
in their attack.

1059
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:34,215
And before
he lost consciousness,

1060
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:35,583
his skin would have flushed,

1061
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:38,318
accompanied by burning pain...

1062
01:27:39,553 --> 01:27:41,987
A drop in blood pressure,
weakness.

1063
01:27:43,723 --> 01:27:45,724
His throat and mouth
would be swollen

1064
01:27:45,726 --> 01:27:47,958
which explains
why he didn't call for help.

1065
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,661
Then a drop in heart rate...

1066
01:27:52,896 --> 01:27:54,996
Inability to breathe...

1067
01:27:57,299 --> 01:27:58,732
Shock.

1068
01:27:59,767 --> 01:28:01,807
Did you know
he was allergic to bees?

1069
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:10,875
I was certain he wasn't.

1070
01:29:33,823 --> 01:29:35,924
No, no! No, Mrs. Munro, no!

1071
01:29:36,525 --> 01:29:37,892
You mustn't do that!

1072
01:29:38,994 --> 01:29:41,961
My son... won't wake.

1073
01:29:44,664 --> 01:29:46,064
He may never wake.

1074
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:48,799
They sent me away till morning.

1075
01:29:49,834 --> 01:29:51,201
You didn't even have the decency

1076
01:29:51,203 --> 01:29:53,163
to tell me
what'd happened to him!

1077
01:29:54,437 --> 01:29:56,939
I didn't think
it would make a difference.

1078
01:29:56,941 --> 01:29:58,340
I'm his mother!

1079
01:29:59,608 --> 01:30:01,108
I'm his mother...

1080
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,544
And you stole him from me!

1081
01:30:04,546 --> 01:30:06,045
He's all I had!

1082
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,280
And I've lost him now.

1083
01:30:09,515 --> 01:30:11,883
Why wasn't it you
they did it to?

1084
01:30:13,218 --> 01:30:15,652
- It should've been you!
- The bees were not to blame.

1085
01:30:15,654 --> 01:30:16,986
They're all you care about!

1086
01:30:16,988 --> 01:30:18,721
No! I care about Roger.

1087
01:30:19,489 --> 01:30:21,823
I care about him very much.

1088
01:30:34,233 --> 01:30:37,301
The bees... didn't do it.

1089
01:30:38,736 --> 01:30:41,270
The bees were not to blame.

1090
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:52,879
It was the wasps!

1091
01:30:52,881 --> 01:30:55,581
Roger was trying to find out
what was killing the bees.

1092
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,550
And he did.
He found the wasps' nest.

1093
01:30:58,552 --> 01:31:01,019
He had to stop them
wiping out the bees.

1094
01:31:01,021 --> 01:31:03,421
And so he did
the worst possible thing.

1095
01:31:03,423 --> 01:31:06,257
He tried to drown them
with water from his can.

1096
01:31:07,058 --> 01:31:09,092
How do you know it was them?

1097
01:31:09,094 --> 01:31:11,894
Bees leave their stings.
Wasps don't.

1098
01:31:11,896 --> 01:31:14,396
There were no stings left
in Roger's face.

1099
01:31:14,398 --> 01:31:16,698
And when they attacked,
he dropped the watering can

1100
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,499
and ran up to protect the bees.

1101
01:31:18,501 --> 01:31:21,434
There are his footprints from
the apiary to the nest and back.

1102
01:31:22,402 --> 01:31:24,269
He was trying
to save the bees.

1103
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:25,469
Yes.

1104
01:31:27,605 --> 01:31:28,938
Yes.

1105
01:32:11,046 --> 01:32:13,147
There was a woman, once.

1106
01:32:13,915 --> 01:32:15,882
I knew her less than a day.

1107
01:32:16,917 --> 01:32:18,917
A quarter of an hour's
conversation.

1108
01:32:20,386 --> 01:32:22,053
She needed my help.

1109
01:32:23,588 --> 01:32:26,356
She needed so desperately
to be understood by someone...

1110
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:29,658
Me.

1111
01:32:31,127 --> 01:32:33,628
So, I laid out the particulars
of her case as I saw them...

1112
01:32:34,463 --> 01:32:36,297
To her satisfaction, I thought.

1113
01:32:37,265 --> 01:32:39,332
I watched her walk away.

1114
01:32:40,567 --> 01:32:42,800
And within hours
she'd ended her life.

1115
01:32:45,603 --> 01:32:48,905
By identifying the cause of
her despair with such clarity,

1116
01:32:48,907 --> 01:32:52,508
I'd given her carte blanche
to do just as she intended.

1117
01:32:54,844 --> 01:32:57,978
I should've done
whatever it took to save her.

1118
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,814
Lie to her, make up a story.

1119
01:33:03,483 --> 01:33:07,285
Take her by the hand
and hold her as she wept,

1120
01:33:07,287 --> 01:33:09,520
and said, "Come live with me.

1121
01:33:11,022 --> 01:33:13,089
Let us be alone together."

1122
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,729
But I was fearful.

1123
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:25,365
Selfish.

1124
01:33:29,936 --> 01:33:32,304
She's the reason...

1125
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:34,339
I came here to my bees,

1126
01:33:35,474 --> 01:33:38,175
so that I couldn't harm
anyone ever again.

1127
01:33:42,446 --> 01:33:44,512
I'm leaving you the house.

1128
01:33:46,314 --> 01:33:48,014
You and Roger.

1129
01:33:49,383 --> 01:33:54,853
House, grounds, apiary,
everything within and without.

1130
01:33:54,855 --> 01:33:56,521
And as I shan't change my mind

1131
01:33:56,523 --> 01:33:58,489
on this point,
you will see, I trust,

1132
01:33:58,491 --> 01:34:02,559
that it will be greatly less
complicated for all concerned

1133
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:04,160
if the two of you

1134
01:34:04,162 --> 01:34:05,794
don't go off...

1135
01:34:05,796 --> 01:34:09,364
...to somewhere like...
Portsmouth.

1136
01:34:13,468 --> 01:34:14,868
Mrs. Munro?

1137
01:34:15,402 --> 01:34:16,869
Roger's awake.

1138
01:34:59,378 --> 01:35:02,446
Dear Mr. Umezaki,

1139
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:06,749
<i>I write to tell you
that I have at last</i>

1140
01:35:06,751 --> 01:35:08,950
<i>recalled my meeting
with your father.</i>

1141
01:35:11,186 --> 01:35:15,087
<i>A woman had died because
I failed to solve her case.</i>

1142
01:35:16,622 --> 01:35:19,790
<i>Guilt and recrimination
having taken their toll on me,</i>

1143
01:35:19,792 --> 01:35:22,425
<i>my powers
were far from at their best</i>

1144
01:35:23,627 --> 01:35:25,667
<i>when I received
an urgent message</i>

1145
01:35:26,762 --> 01:35:28,195
<i>summoning me
to the Diogenes Club</i>

1146
01:35:28,197 --> 01:35:30,696
<i>to meet with my brother Mycroft.</i>

1147
01:35:32,532 --> 01:35:35,200
This gentleman has made
an offer of service.

1148
01:35:36,035 --> 01:35:37,634
He wishes to work for the Crown.

1149
01:35:39,937 --> 01:35:42,104
I'm here to be tested,
Mr. Holmes.

1150
01:35:42,972 --> 01:35:44,839
<i>I very much want to be of use.</i>

1151
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,940
Do you think that I am suited?

1152
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,641
I'm sure, sir.

1153
01:35:49,576 --> 01:35:51,944
Good.
There is one minor issue.

1154
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:54,813
Mr. Umezaki
has a wife and child in Japan.

1155
01:35:55,915 --> 01:35:57,995
He wonders
what would be the best course.

1156
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:11,195
Write a letter saying
you plan to stay on in England.

1157
01:36:12,297 --> 01:36:14,377
Could be a long while
until your return.

1158
01:36:16,332 --> 01:36:17,832
<i>Your father went on to serve</i>

1159
01:36:17,834 --> 01:36:20,935
<i>the British Empire
for many years</i>

1160
01:36:20,937 --> 01:36:24,504
<i>in absolute secrecy and
with the greatest distinction,</i>

1161
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:26,572
from...

1162
01:36:36,482 --> 01:36:40,751
the Malay... Straits...

1163
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:45,655
to the Arabian Sea.

1164
01:36:48,258 --> 01:36:50,959
<i>He was a man of courage,</i>
heart and dignity,

1165
01:36:50,961 --> 01:36:53,695
<i>of whom a beloved wife
and cherished son</i>

1166
01:36:53,697 --> 01:36:57,098
may be deservedly proud.

1167
01:36:58,133 --> 01:37:01,168
Sherlock Holmes.

1168
01:37:07,007 --> 01:37:08,207
Hmmm.

1169
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,087
My friend John.

1170
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:34,464
My brother Mycroft.

1171
01:37:37,701 --> 01:37:39,034
Mrs. Hudson.

1172
01:37:39,902 --> 01:37:41,803
Masuo Umezaki.

1173
01:37:42,771 --> 01:37:45,906
Maya... Umezaki.

1174
01:37:51,611 --> 01:37:53,044
Ann.

1175
01:37:57,415 --> 01:37:59,215
And who is that one for?

1176
01:38:00,016 --> 01:38:01,983
Me. You.

1177
01:38:03,752 --> 01:38:05,885
Well, not yet awhile, surely?

1178
01:38:08,421 --> 01:38:10,421
Did you finish
what you had to do?

1179
01:38:10,789 --> 01:38:12,389
Yes, I did.

1180
01:38:13,491 --> 01:38:15,571
My first foray
into the world of fiction.

1181
01:38:17,027 --> 01:38:19,895
One shouldn't leave this life
without a sense of completion.

1182
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:27,834
You can use this
in one of your stories.

1183
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:32,671
A glass, a bee...

1184
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:35,705
and Roger.

1185
01:38:38,442 --> 01:38:40,009
Show me how to knock them out.

1186
01:38:44,147 --> 01:38:45,347
Go on.

1187
01:38:50,519 --> 01:38:52,720
- The queen runs the colony.
- Mm-hmm.

1188
01:38:52,722 --> 01:38:54,822
The drones service the queen.

1189
01:38:54,824 --> 01:38:56,890
The workers do the work.

1190
01:38:56,892 --> 01:38:58,892
Isn't it true?

1191
01:38:59,305 --> 01:39:59,799
