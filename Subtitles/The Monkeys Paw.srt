2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,948
Open this door right now.

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,585
Open this door.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,425
Mary, get back.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,351
No, Mary. No.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,744
- No.
- No!

7
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,959
Don't...

8
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,303
don't play with fate boy.

9
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,268
Nothing good will come.

10
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,879
I know you more into cars, Jake,
but look at that right there.

11
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,159
That's a dang
Rembrandt right there.

12
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,239
- See?
- Oh yeah.

13
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,439
That's beautiful, Catfish.
Yeah.

14
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,989
Not really into guns, man.
More of a lover, not a fighter.

15
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,839
There you go.
That's the trouble with you.

16
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,661
Thinking you gel to choose.

17
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,830
Hey.

18
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,959
Where is Cobb?

19
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,909
I think he's fixing a forklift.

20
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,439
You hand checked that truck to
Iberia this morning, right?

21
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,879
Yeah. Gill, it's in the computer.

22
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,799
Don't want to hear about
anymore short loads.

23
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,159
Look, Mr. Gillespie, I got these
two loads that I'm trying to get

24
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,519
ready for freight, and then I got two
more that I'm trying to prep, man.

25
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,319
Jake, when I promoted
you to shift supervisor,

26
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,599
it's 'cause you said you could
handle the extra responsibility.

27
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,759
Now, if you can't, tell me.

28
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,599
'Cause it's my ass on the line.
Not yours.

29
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,148
Gill, we're good.

30
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,146
Hey.

31
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,306
It's my ass on the line, not yours.

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,919
That guy promoted me just to shovel
more of his work on me, ya know?

33
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,239
Just another day of
missing visiting hours.

34
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,199
That's all that means.

35
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,479
How is that red hot
mama of yours anyway?

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
That's gross.

37
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,708
When you talk about my
mom like that, it's weird.

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,239
You know, man, she got
another round of chemo,

39
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,719
and she'll be okay.

40
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,719
You bet she is.
She's gonna pull through.

41
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,399
All right, let's
quit farting around.

42
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,902
Back to work.

43
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,319
Yeah, I certainly
do apologize, sir.

44
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,399
No, no. Of course, we
appreciate your business.

45
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,188
This is just what we
call simple human error.

46
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,940
Thank you.

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,822
Mr. Gillespie, a moment please.

48
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,879
Check that out.

49
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,319
Hey, man, what's goin' on in there?

50
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,639
I heard another truck
come up short.

51
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,679
I'd say it's about curtains
for Gillespie this time.

52
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,279
I should say something.
I got to go do something.

53
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,679
I tell you what you do.

54
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,919
Call your ex.

55
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,599
- Olivia?
- Call Olivia, man.

56
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,279
Have her put in a
word with the hubby.

57
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,279
Maybe save Gillespie a job.
Go on, do it.

58
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,399
Man, it's been three years.

59
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,479
I know.
You and her, you're special.

60
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,879
Kevin's wife, man?
She can't save someone's job.

61
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,439
That's the stupidest idea.

62
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,988
All right.
Well, you asked.

63
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,119
- Hey, sorry to interrupt guys.
- Not a good time.

64
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,639
Mr. Gillespie, I just
need you to sign off...

65
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,359
Mr. Gillespie is no longer with us.

66
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,479
Put your paperwork on my desk.

67
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,919
No, Kevin.
Is this necessary?

68
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,559
At the office, it's Mr. Weese.
Go back to work.

69
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,279
- You know...
- It's not a good time, Jake!

70
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,748
Damn you, Kevin.

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,839
Way to make the tough
call there, boss man.

72
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,830
Excuse me, Anthony?

73
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,239
Hard working old man like that.

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,959
Hey, what the hell?
Let's get rid of 'em.

75
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,239
Somebody got to take the fall.

76
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,639
The buck got to stop somewhere.
Not with you.

77
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,599
Is this funny to you?

78
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,879
Well, it's not like
ha, ha funny, no.

79
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,479
How about joining 'em?
Would that be funny?

80
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,319
How about you try that?
I'll go right to corporate.

81
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,279
Who I'm sure would love to hear about
your erratic behavior, frequent cat naps.

82
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,559
You push a button on a large machine,
and you hardly do that well.

83
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,439
So don't act like you're so special

84
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,719
that anyone would miss
you if you were gone.

85
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,199
They won't.

86
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,351
So, back to work.

87
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,919
There you go, man.

88
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,399
Pretty much done.

89
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,839
Come on.

90
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,279
Need a ride?

91
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,748
No, man. I'm good.

92
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,119
All right. But I won't
be offering forever now.

93
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,279
I'm all right, man.

94
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,159
Walking helps me, you
know, clear my head.

95
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,679
I don't know how you do
it walking all the time.

96
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,199
All right, man.
See ya later, Catfish.

97
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,079
Get a couple more shotgun
bumper stickers.

98
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,991
Later, boy.

99
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,799
Hey, who's sweet stang
is that outside?

100
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,711
Do I look like a valet to you?

101
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,079
- I saved you a seat.
- Hey, what's up boss?

102
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,839
Two beers.
You still drinking beer?

103
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,388
Hey, man, does a frog scratch
his ass before he farts?

104
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,639
- Here's to the life, huh?
- Yeah. Carry on.

105
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,679
Hey, grandpa.

106
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,759
Hey, hey, hey.
Watch out you.

107
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,399
Might have to take
you over my knee.

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,599
That'll be interesting.

109
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,279
Teach him some manners.

110
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,319
Honey, I tried.

111
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,839
You failed, but I
do crave discipline.

112
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,719
Maybe you should take
me over your knee.

113
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,790
Maybe.

114
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,159
She likes me.

115
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,359
Yeah, you think she
likes the old ones, huh?

116
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,559
No. Not the older ones,
the classy ones.

117
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,719
Hey, speaking of which, did
you see that GT out in the yard?

118
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,159
Oh, hell yeah.
Did you see that GT out there?

119
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,359
I'm sorry to break up the party.

120
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,385
Gander yonder right there.

121
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,279
Old man over there.

122
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,319
Yeah, thanks for bringing
the bad news, Catfish.

123
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,231
Always good to see ya.

124
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,279
I didn't know he was
gonna be here tonight.

125
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,239
Don't let it bring you down.
You didn't fire him.

126
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,279
That son of a bitch Kevin did.

127
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,199
That's gonna come back on him.

128
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,639
You know what goes
around comes around.

129
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,759
It's called karma, boy.

130
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,719
It just seems like
there's guys out there

131
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,319
that they can't even
fail if they try.

132
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,479
Uh-oh. Hey, Judy, bring
two of these, will ya?

133
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,519
Gonna need 'em.

134
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,159
We box bolts and
straps for a living.

135
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,399
That's what we do.

136
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,559
We take bolts and straps,
and we put 'em in a box.

137
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,679
Like, what kid wants to do
that when they grow up?

138
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,239
You gonna do other things.
You're still young.

139
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,559
Still young.

140
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,119
You know what, what do I have
to look forward to, Cobb?

141
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,439
I got my mom.
She's dying of cancer.

142
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,159
Then my brother...
he's calling me all the time

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,639
asking me to help him
pay these bills,

144
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,159
and I can't afford a car to walk...

145
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,759
I'm walking all around town
trying to get where I'm going.

146
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,107
I got the scum bucket of a boss
married to my ex-girlfriend.

147
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,639
It's like ever since I left
that girl, man, it's just like

148
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,349
the first domino in this
long line of bad decisions.

149
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,279
Things work out.
Like I say, you're still young.

150
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,239
Are you listening to me?

151
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,199
Yeah, I'm listening to you, man.

152
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,828
Why don't you listen
to me for a minute.

153
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,346
Hey, look at this.

154
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,759
You know what that is?

155
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,279
That's a court order.

156
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,359
Let me tell you a story.

157
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,119
The old man fall in love,
yeah with a younger girl.

158
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,599
I thought she loved me too.

159
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,679
We had a kid together.

160
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,239
I mean, I'm thinking wedding bells,

161
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,239
white picket fences, whew!

162
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,919
I guess she wasn't
thinking that way because

163
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,919
this is what love looks like, man.

164
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,119
That's a court order.

165
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,119
That says that I cannot come
within 500 yards of my own son.

166
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,270
My own son!

167
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,279
I mean, she can rot in hell,
but I would like to see my boy

168
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,319
now and again.

169
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,159
Yeah, you got problems, huh?

170
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,399
I tell you something
about the courts.

171
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,279
They gonna side with the woman
every time, don't matter if

172
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,342
she's a woman of your dreams or a
frigid cold, vindictive bitch.

173
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,704
Anyway, we all got problems, Jake.

174
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,399
Hey man.
I'm sorry about that.

175
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,119
I didn't know you had a kid.

176
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,639
That's all right.
Don't matter.

177
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,239
All I'm saying is we
all get dealt cards.

178
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,239
It's how you play 'em and man,

179
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,186
play yours better
than I played mine.

180
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,705
Hey, thanks man.

181
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,639
Hey, I'm a be right
back, all right?

182
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,679
Yeah. I'm gonna go
get some air myself.

183
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,959
Ow!

184
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,827
Hit me like that.

185
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,589
Hey, Gill.

186
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,479
Look man, I'm sorry about the
way things went down today.

187
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,559
It's not so bad, kid.

188
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,279
Don't worry about it.

189
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,639
Hell, he give me a
second chance at life.

190
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,759
And after all, a man my age

191
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,279
should have no problem
finding another job.

192
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,799
Well, with the job market being
in such good shape and all...

193
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,541
as am I.

194
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,239
Plus with my generous
severance package,

195
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,708
future's looking
pretty damn bright.

196
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,439
I guess I should be
thanking you, Jake.

197
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,119
That what you come over here for?

198
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,748
So as I could thank ya?

199
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,750
Yeah, I was just... sorry.

200
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,101
Hey boy, brought you
something to ease the pain.

201
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,279
I hope you noticed that

202
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,703
I tried to stick up for
you back there today.

203
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,359
Yeah, but Weese has had
a bean up his butt

204
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,669
about me from the start.

205
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,870
What is that?

206
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,704
It's just some ugly old thing
my daddy give me as a boy.

207
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,706
I should've got rid of
it a long time ago.

208
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,519
- It's a monkey's paw.
- What?

209
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,919
Monkey's paw.

210
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,900
My dad said it'll do
magic if you want it to.

211
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,542
Hey, monkey magic?

212
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,439
Some kind of hoodoo?

213
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,759
I never would've taken
you as an obeah, man.

214
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,750
A little too pale.

215
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,981
Tell you honestly, I'm
not sure what it is.

216
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,439
But I tell you this, my daddy
said it could take hold of

217
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,786
a man's life, move
the pieces around.

218
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,439
Just gets passed on from
one person to the next

219
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,519
bending a man's fate
to his own will,

220
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,829
giving him whatever he wants.

221
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,340
How?
How does it work?

222
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,940
Three bones.

223
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,861
Three good wishes that
only his owner can ask.

224
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,239
You ever see 'em actually
work... the wishes?

225
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,980
Of course.

226
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,621
I wished for eternal good looks.

227
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,191
Go ahead.

228
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,990
Give it a shot.

229
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,990
All right.

230
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,904
Won't be too hard.

231
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,862
I wish for that
bitching GT outside.

232
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,319
All right.

233
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,221
Felt good.
You guys feel that?

234
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,319
It's my turn.

235
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,026
No.

236
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,305
It's his now.

237
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,702
Won't work for no one else until
he finishes his three bones.

238
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,679
I can't.
It's yours.

239
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,239
It's, you know, from
your dad and all.

240
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,239
No.

241
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,239
It's yours now.

242
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,708
Just an old trinket anyhow.

243
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,220
Doing me a favor getting
that thing out of my sight.

244
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,142
Consider it a peace treaty.

245
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,591
No hard feelings.

246
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,304
No hard feelings, boy.

247
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,306
Hey!
Still here.

248
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,707
Man, she is pretty.

249
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,270
Whose is that?

250
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,159
Look at that.

251
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,799
Whoa.

252
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,559
Come on, man. Let's go.
I'm getting tired.

253
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,239
How about that?

254
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,519
Damn!
Damn, Jake!

255
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,704
Keys are in it.

256
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,709
Look for yourself!

257
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,519
Whoa, how about that?
That thing works!

258
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,759
Come on, man.
You know that's a coincidence.

259
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,910
Maybe.

260
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,944
Man, come on, baby!

261
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,919
Car's not in the driveway.

262
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,070
I don't think she's home.

263
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,279
Exactly what was the plan here?

264
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,479
What do you figure you gonna
drive up and sweep her off her

265
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,871
feet, drive off into the
sunset just the three of us?

266
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,279
You ready to go?
I'm ready to go.

267
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,919
No, no.
Hold on.

268
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,263
Just so it shouldn't
be a total loss.

269
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,199
Cobb, what are you doing?

270
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,839
Just stay in the car, Jake.

271
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,759
Don't get your panties in a twist.

272
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,519
- Get back in the car!
- That's all right.

273
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,439
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna leave a message

274
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,839
on the little car right now.

275
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,559
This is our boss' house!
Seriously, stop!

276
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,679
Don't do that.
Don't ever do that.

277
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,591
Come on, man.

278
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,119
Look, we got to go, all right?

279
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,599
All right, but don't forget.

280
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,944
You mess with the Cobb,
you get the corn.

281
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,319
Huh?

282
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,788
Nasty drunk, you know that?

283
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,830
Uh-oh.

284
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,239
What's going on, Jake?

285
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,679
Hey, Olivia.

286
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,399
Kevin's not home.

287
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,159
A little late for stopping
by don't ya think?

288
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,519
Is it?

289
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,239
Sorry.

290
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,919
I don't have my phone on me.

291
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,639
- You drunk?
- No. You know Tony?

292
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,319
He works at the factory.

293
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,439
Hi Tony.
Who's car?

294
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,079
That's mine.

295
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,839
- You have a car now?
- Yeah.

296
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,279
I wished for it.

297
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,799
Okay.

298
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,359
Hey, Olivia...

299
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,159
What part of this
don't you understand?

300
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,879
Where is Kevin at
this time of night?

301
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,119
Shouldn't he be home?

302
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,279
He's prepping for the
fundraiser at St. Luke's.

303
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,239
But I just drove by there,
and they're all closed up,

304
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,799
so I will be expecting
him back shortly.

305
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,839
Why are you looking for him?

306
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,229
I'm...

307
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,239
here for you.

308
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,879
Yeah, that's one thing
you've never been.

309
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,279
That's really mean
and really not nice.

310
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,260
I'm married, Jake.
Too little, too late.

311
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,980
Says who?

312
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,745
Me.

313
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,759
Go on. Go home

314
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,627
before Kevin gets home
and fires your ass.

315
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,519
Night, Tony.

316
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,704
Hey.

317
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,708
Gosh, she's really pretty.

318
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,599
She's kind of a fetching
girl, ain't she?

319
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,719
See the way she look at you?
I think you got a shot.

320
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,239
You think you got a shot with her?

321
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,719
What are you doing with that knife, Cobb?
Just gonna twist his titties, that's all.

322
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,759
Just gonna break his
chops a little.

323
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,359
Yeah, it didn't seem like you
were breaking chops, man.

324
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,519
What did it look like?

325
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,839
I don't know.
Looks like you were

326
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,639
losing your mind a
little bit, that's what.

327
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,747
Hey man, I'm not the one making
wishes on a monkey's paw, am I?

328
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,230
- Maybe I am...
- I'm sorry about that.

329
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,391
Watch it!

330
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,745
Cobb.

331
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,824
Hey.

332
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,702
- Dude, help me.
- What's that?

333
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,946
Hey, buddy.

334
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,266
Cobb?

335
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,070
I'm gonna call for help.

336
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,909
Hey, man.

337
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,750
I wish you weren't dead.

338
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,711
Help!

339
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,310
Oh my lord.

340
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,239
911 operator. What's
your emergency?

341
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,279
Hell on earth, sister.

342
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,079
I need an ambulance fast
as you can, all right?

343
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,599
Where you located?

344
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,279
I'm a ways out on
I-10 near Mettery.

345
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,239
Stay calm. Go ahead and
tell me what happened.

346
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,708
I didn't see a damn thing.

347
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,839
I don't know.

348
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,159
I just... I was driving along
on the road and then I just

349
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,239
stopped, and I saw him
and I think this fella's dead.

350
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,981
I don't know.
You need to come now!

351
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,079
Yes!

352
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,662
I told you!
I don't know what's going on.

353
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,784
Am I still dead?

354
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,263
Take hold of a man's life,

355
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,709
bending a man's fate,

356
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,188
giving him whatever he wants.

357
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,879
I got three brothers.

358
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,559
As we speak, one's locked up.
One's an MP.

359
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,559
One's a minor league
hockey forward.

360
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,519
My ex, we used to call him Bailey,

361
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,199
so you see I've had my fair
share of patching up noggins

362
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,239
over the years.

363
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,547
Still say you ought to go to the
hospital, but no one listens to me.

364
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,984
I don't feel nothing.

365
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,390
Tough stuff, huh?

366
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,710
Press it.

367
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,439
Poor thing.

368
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,705
Been through a trauma.
Your beard is all white.

369
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,791
I always did have a thing
for the old fellers.

370
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,904
Who's Abby?

371
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,185
Real nice.

372
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,351
Hey, Jamie.

373
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,709
Because I brought someone home.

374
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,262
It's not that interesting.

375
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,799
Okay, and I'm freaking
bored, all right?

376
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,270
Turns out, there wasn't much
to work with it anyway.

377
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,345
I'll call you back.

378
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,119
I think you should go home,

379
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,702
send you on back to
that Abby of yours.

380
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,639
Hey! Where you going with that?

381
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,744
That's my hoodie.

382
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,119
- Hey!
- Good morning, detective.

383
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,519
Good morning to you.
How you doing today?

384
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,068
- Very good, sir.
- Good.

385
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,548
Can I help you with something, sir?

386
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,151
Hey, son.

387
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,359
Let's you and me go fishing.

388
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,199
You've got about two minutes!

389
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,679
Response time around
here is pretty good!

390
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,228
You are not invited!

391
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,119
What'd you do to your face?

392
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,199
You know, actually I don't care!

393
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,879
Yes, hello? I need police, please.

394
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,879
- Look at you.
- Restraining order violation.

395
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,159
Growing up! Getting big!

396
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,584
You stay away from him!
You get off of my property now!

397
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,039
Take this.
Go and get in the car.

398
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,839
Huh?
No, ma'am.

399
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,239
He's not my husband.

400
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,719
Yes, he's driving away.

401
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,063
I'll stay on the phone with you.

402
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,799
Look, I'm just trying to
find my friend, all right?

403
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,904
C-O-B-B.

404
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,199
He's not in the ER.

405
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,559
Jake, boy.

406
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,199
You see Cobb?

407
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,719
I ain't seen him.

408
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,199
All right. Thank you.

409
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,039
I checked outside, where he
usually likes to kick a couple,

410
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,951
but I don't know.

411
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,319
Look, what do I look
like his mother, Catfish?

412
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,279
I'm sure he's fine.

413
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,861
All right.

414
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,311
Is it a crime that I asked?

415
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,199
You said that you
were working late.

416
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,879
This is not a suitable
time or the place.

417
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,679
No. I want to know.
Where were you?

418
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,719
I told you.

419
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,700
You're running around town...

420
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,670
Olivia!

421
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,225
Not now, Jake.

422
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,670
Is there something I can do?

423
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,279
Yeah, give me a do over.
This whole thing all of it.

424
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,589
Could you do that?

425
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,669
That's what I thought.

426
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,785
- Need a lift?
- No, I'm good.

427
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,159
That's it, right there.
Last straw, boy.

428
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,319
No more.

429
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,239
If a boy don't want to do nothing
the hard way, the hard way you do?

430
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,708
See you, Catfish.

431
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,230
Enjoy your weekend.

432
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,820
Jake.

433
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,111
Surprise.

434
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,719
I thought you were dead.

435
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,984
I believe I was.

436
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,704
That's impossible.

437
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,749
It's the paw, Jake.

438
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,359
Three wishes.

439
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,599
First the car, then me.

440
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,799
You wished this on me, didn't ya?

441
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,599
Didn't ya?

442
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,439
- No.
- Yeah, you did.

443
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,559
Cobb, no.
I didn't.

444
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,039
I want that third wish.

445
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,719
Gillespie said there's no wish.

446
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,439
It's the paw.
It's trash.

447
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,544
It's a trinket.

448
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,661
It's Olivia, isn't it?

449
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,079
What are you talking about?

450
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,679
Jake, you don't got to waste
that third wish on her.

451
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,228
You gonna get her
back without wishing.

452
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,151
I promise you.

453
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,708
I'll see you later...

454
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,549
alligator.

455
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,799
I hope you don't mind
the change of setting.

456
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,679
I don't mind, baby.

457
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,830
It's cozy.

458
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,625
Hello!

459
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,986
Cobb?

460
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,584
What the hell are you doing here?

461
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,945
Overtime?

462
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,024
No, no, no, no, no.

463
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,399
Cobb!

464
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,879
Cobb, untie me right now!

465
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,905
Cobb, get me out of here!

466
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,199
Cobb!

467
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,679
I pushed the button
on a large machine,

468
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,839
and I hardly do that too
good, but you know what?

469
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,679
I do it just good enough.

470
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,039
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

471
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,159
Listen to me!
Cobb!

472
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,759
Oh, stop acting like
you so special!

473
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,479
Ain't nobody gonna miss
you when you're gone!

474
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,239
No, no, wait, wait.
Listen to me.

475
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,151
Cobb, just listen to me, please.

476
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,111
Hey, Charlie.

477
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,509
Yeah, I know man.
I'm on my way.

478
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,199
Are you sure you're
all right there, Jake?

479
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,239
No, I'm fine.

480
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,439
You know, just some late
nights... a couple of...

481
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,199
a little bit of trouble at work.
That's all.

482
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,319
- There you go, baby.
- Thanks, Sandy.

483
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,159
It's not a layoff is it?

484
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,599
We can still carry
most of mom's bill,

485
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,479
but I'll still need some
help like we talked about.

486
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,824
Yeah. We're good.
It's not layoffs.

487
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,279
How's mom doing by the way?

488
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,239
You'd know if you
went and visited her.

489
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,159
Come on, Charlie.

490
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,399
Betty's doing fine, Jake.

491
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,719
I'm going to visit her.
All right?

492
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,665
When?

493
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,870
Yeah, you better get that.

494
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,199
Honey.

495
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,145
Babe.

496
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,519
- Hey.
- Hey, Jake.

497
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,359
Sorry to bother you.

498
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,799
I didn't know who else to call.

499
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,519
Are you all right?

500
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,830
Kevin didn't come home last night.

501
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,199
You didn't have to come
all the way down here.

502
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,190
You sounded pretty shaken up.

503
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,519
He has stayed out before,
but not this long.

504
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,022
Well, I'm sure he's
just cooling off.

505
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,861
To tell you the truth, it's the
cooling off that's the problem.

506
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,186
Me and him...

507
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,711
You and him what?

508
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,304
I don't even know anymore.

509
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,239
I need to get back to this.

510
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,823
Hey, let me buy you
a cup of coffee.

511
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,799
I know it's hard for
you to believe,

512
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,199
but he was really good to me
when we first started out.

513
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,190
He listened.

514
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,839
Sorry.
What were you saying?

515
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,039
Of course, he listened.
He was your AA sponsor.

516
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,239
He used to be present.

517
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,759
He wasn't afraid of the future,
and I needed that after you.

518
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,159
I wasn't afraid of the future.

519
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,199
No. You just never
even thought about it.

520
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,304
It's worse.

521
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,719
I got an idea.

522
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,949
Come on.
Come with me.

523
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,670
It's gonna be fun.

524
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,399
Afraid of the future, huh?

525
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,199
I knew you'd sit with me as
soon as I saw you walking there.

526
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,225
I'm sure you did.

527
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,661
Palms or cards?
What's your pleasure?

528
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,584
Cards.

529
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,545
I beg your pardon?

530
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,639
You have willingly entered
into the combination

531
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,719
of that what is dark.

532
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,702
Now you sit responsible
for the man with no soul.

533
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,879
He's upon your life.

534
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,668
You make him so he makes you.

535
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,188
You got your wish...

536
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,510
Olivia.

537
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,510
What did you do?

538
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,839
Now it's my turn.

539
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,229
There is no wish.

540
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,119
The car was already there,
Cobb, and you're not dead.

541
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,190
I want it, Jake.

542
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,504
I don't have it.

543
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,791
I mean, I went looking
for it, and I can't find it.

544
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,783
I'm sorry.

545
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,826
I can't help you.

546
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,839
My mom's cancer...
I'm helping my brother...

547
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,547
my brother is asking me
to help her pay her bills.

548
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,279
I don't know what broke inside you,

549
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,748
but something's broken, man.

550
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,864
I get it.

551
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,902
Man, I don't owe you a damn thing.

552
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,509
Yeah, you do.

553
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,199
How are we doing, Ms. Betty?

554
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,180
Better than Custer,
worst than I'd like.

555
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,159
My youngest supposed to visit
today, but we'll just see.

556
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,519
That sounds nice.

557
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,261
We'll be back to check
on you in a little bit.

558
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,544
Jake?

559
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,669
I'm a friend of your son.

560
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,547
He asked me to come by.

561
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,799
I'm sorry.

562
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,479
What for, doll?

563
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,506
I'm gonna put my hands
over your face now.

564
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,670
It's all right.

565
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,359
I been there.

566
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,624
Not so bad.

567
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,999
Jake?

568
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,839
Sandy, hey, where is she?

569
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,399
What happened?

570
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,665
It was something with her heart.
They're not quite sure.

571
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,079
Where's Charlie?

572
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,199
He's on his way back
from Baton Rouge.

573
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,559
I'm so sorry.

574
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,799
Can I see her?

575
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,199
They're not letting anybody in.

576
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,101
Where is she?
What'd they do with her?

577
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,119
- What'd they do with her?
- Jake!

578
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,100
Don't go crazy.
It was just her time!

579
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,319
Yeah.

580
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,584
Condolences.

581
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,199
What did you do?

582
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,559
Come see me.
We'll talk.

583
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,188
Where?

584
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,025
Cobb!

585
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,150
Cobb!

586
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,670
Was it you?

587
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,668
I did it for you, Jake.

588
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,270
That'll do.

589
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,119
You are one selfish
son of a bitch, Jake!

590
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,999
You got what you want.

591
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,519
Got your girl back.

592
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,039
Your mom is in peace.

593
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,359
It's my turn now!

594
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,359
- What do you want?
- I want my boy.

595
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,559
I want him to love me!

596
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,039
I want you to wish my
son back into my life!

597
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,905
I don't have it.

598
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,743
You better find it!

599
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,759
No.

600
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,625
Then what are you on?

601
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,159
I'm not on anything.

602
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,839
Okay.

603
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,359
So some old grump gives
you this... what was it?

604
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,519
- A paw,
- A paw?

605
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,670
Which is where now?

606
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,159
I threw it away.

607
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,399
A paw?

608
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,159
Says you get three wishes.

609
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,759
You wished for a car,
which you then steal?

610
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,239
- It's hard to explain.
- I'm doing all right, I think!

611
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,239
You steal it.
You wreck it.

612
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,399
Your buddy from work is chunked
in the brains, but you wish him

613
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,079
back to life, maybe, and now
he's threatening people you know

614
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,719
if you don't give
him your last wish!

615
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,239
And also you're not on drugs.
Did I leave anything out?

616
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,039
Yeah.
Sarcasm, Charlie.

617
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,719
Hell, yes, sarcasm!
I just lost my mother.

618
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,399
It sounds crazy.

619
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,199
Yeah.
Yeah, it does, Jake.

620
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,479
Guys, you need to call the police.

621
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,479
I know.

622
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,319
I think you guys need
to get out of town

623
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,199
until all this blows
over just for a bit.

624
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,199
JJ, what have you done?

625
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:13,119
Hey, we could take a few
days off up at the cabin.

626
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,545
Might be good for you, for
us after your mom and all.

627
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,439
Okay?

628
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,146
Okay.

629
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,705
Whatever you say.

630
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,799
Mr. Tilton?
Detective Margolis.

631
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,839
So, this man you say is
making threats against you.

632
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,159
When did you see him last?

633
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,199
This morning.

634
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,239
He assaulted me.

635
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,159
Got some bruises I see.

636
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,839
He also murdered my mother.

637
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,039
Yeah, about that, I spoke with
the attending over at Charity,

638
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,319
and they're saying heart failure.

639
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,825
When was the last time
you saw Kevin Weese?

640
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,479
What does this have
to do with anything?

641
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,559
You know he's dead?

642
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,119
Somebody crushed him in one
of your industrial presses

643
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,199
over at the supply
warehouse where you and he

644
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,599
and this Mr. Cobb all work.

645
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,023
Tony Cobb.

646
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,519
He did this, man.
You got to believe me.

647
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,025
How long have you been seeing
the late Mr. Weese's wife?

648
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,039
Where are you getting
your information?

649
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,999
- An anonymous tip.
- Tony Cobb.

650
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,359
You haven't denied it yet.

651
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,501
Tony Cobb is behind all this.

652
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,079
I remember you.

653
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,079
You were here the other morning.

654
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,867
You looked like you needed
someone to talk to.

655
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,663
What's on your mind?

656
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,710
Am I under arrest?

657
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,159
No.

658
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,039
No, not yet.

659
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,545
But if you leave town, that
could be a big problem.

660
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,279
You knew, didn't you?

661
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,479
What this thing did.

662
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,239
I knew it was bad luck.

663
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,141
I figured you deserved some.

664
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,839
Did you ever use it?

665
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,069
I never had the guts.

666
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,549
My daddy did, though.

667
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,079
We used to own 30 acres of land
just past the point there.

668
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,279
My dad and mom, my brother and me.

669
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,639
My brother hated it here
so he joined the Corp

670
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,159
as soon as he hit 18.

671
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,159
Mom wasn't happy about it, but
she loved him something fierce.

672
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,239
My daddy was so pissed off

673
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,519
so he rented out my brother's room

674
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,261
to make sure he never come home.

675
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:17,581
One night, a wanderer, weird
fella, he passes through port

676
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:24,199
and needs a place to stay and he
can't pay so he shows my daddy

677
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,466
a collection of trinkets
to barter with,

678
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,359
and among 'em was this
one little monkey's paw.

679
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,119
He tells him wish
on it three times,

680
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,559
give a man whatever he desires.

681
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:43,119
As a joke, my daddy wishes it
to help pay off his mortgage.

682
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,439
Didn't think nothing of it.

683
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,759
Traveler spends the night,

684
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,679
is gone before sun come
up the next morning.

685
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,399
Days later, we got word
my brother died in combat.

686
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,710
But then we get his
life insurance policy,

687
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,667
the exact price of the
mortgage to the penny.

688
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,141
My family was never
the same after that.

689
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,988
What happened with the
other two wishes?

690
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,079
Let's just say my mom
would've done anything to see

691
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,503
my brother's face again.

692
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,068
Don't play with fate, boy.

693
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,239
It did something to Cobb.

694
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,119
I don't know what.

695
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,624
He's different.

696
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,439
Psychotic.

697
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,544
Soulless?

698
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,399
Yeah.

699
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,319
I should've got rid of
that damn thing years ago.

700
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:58,270
Look, if I have this monkey's
paw and it works, right?

701
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,199
Well, then I can just
wish all this undone.

702
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,119
It'll give you what you ask for
but not the way you want it.

703
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,719
It takes from what's there
and spits it back darker.

704
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,599
Poison.

705
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,671
Don't bring anymore
misery upon yourself.

706
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,625
Don't look like it gone well
judging by the look back there.

707
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,030
Let's get out of here.

708
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,900
Feel better?

709
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,199
Mississippi?

710
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,799
Jackson, which was named
after Andrew Jackson.

711
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,199
Right. Nevada?

712
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,304
Carson City.

713
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,822
Hold on, baby.
Stay right here.

714
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,664
Are you Abby?

715
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,399
He came by here...
his face seemed different.

716
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,504
I don't know.

717
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,985
What happened to him?

718
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,463
I don't know.

719
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,150
Something bad.

720
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,999
Whatever it is, I feel responsible.

721
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,719
No. No.

722
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,519
You didn't make him what he is.

723
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,519
You see, Tony was always a bad egg.

724
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,719
I guess that's how I got in trouble
with him in the first place.

725
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,666
I liked bad eggs.

726
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,750
Now, I'm paying for it.

727
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,199
So what are you gonna do now?

728
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,159
I don't know.

729
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,628
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

730
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,708
I should've listened.

731
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,590
No.

732
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,146
No.

733
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,790
No!

734
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,470
No!

735
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,119
Margolis.

736
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,239
The witness described
an older dude.

737
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,639
Big son of a bitch, about 6'2,
drives an old model 4 by 4.

738
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,439
Sounds familiar.

739
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,559
Think it might be that
Tony Cobb character, sir?

740
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,079
The warehouse is the connection.

741
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,679
I don't see Jake Tilton as this
mad ripper type, and the Weese

742
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,719
widow, she doesn't have
the physical strength.

743
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,159
So Cobb, he's our best bet.

744
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,279
Look, I'm gonna go track her down.

745
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,719
See if you can land eyes on Tilton.

746
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,460
Right. I'm on it.

747
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,199
You okay?

748
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,828
Yeah, sure.

749
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,544
Good 'cause I'm not.

750
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,105
Let's go.

751
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,159
Now the so-called police call
this a throw down piece.

752
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,947
Got a file number, got no paper.

753
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,744
You can have it if you need it,
just keep my name all the way out.

754
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,319
It's for self-defense
if that matters.

755
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,359
Sure.

756
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,159
I need to borrow your truck.

757
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,469
Yeah, yeah.

758
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,159
Been some bad, creepy blow
around here the last few day.

759
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,028
Boss Kevin, poor Gillie.

760
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,105
Gillespie?

761
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,199
Ya didn't hear?

762
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,159
Early tonight out by
the trailer of his.

763
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,981
Somebody done burn up
his car real good.

764
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,108
Worse for your health than smoking.

765
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,519
Yeah.

766
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,624
Thanks, Catfish.

767
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,225
I owe you one.

768
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,269
Jake, boy, so much for
lover, not a fighter, huh?

769
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,028
My brother may be a screw up,
but my woman is an absolute rock.

770
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,824
Just get the gas.

771
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,464
Look at this jerk.

772
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,150
I've seen that truck.

773
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,265
This can't be happening.

774
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,439
Charlie, hey. What's up?

775
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,159
- What does he drive?
- What?

776
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,119
Cobb. His car, what is it?

777
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,559
He drives an old car.

778
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,199
He got behind on his payments, and he
doesn't even have it anymore. Why?

779
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,199
Okay.
It's not him.

780
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,359
Never mind.
We're on our way to the cabin.

781
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,639
We thought it was him.

782
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,666
It's just some jackass
tailgating in a busted 4 by 4.

783
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,319
Oh!

784
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,265
Charlie!

785
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,544
Oh God!

786
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,719
There's a man following us.
He intends to harm us.

787
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,824
We need the authorities out here!

788
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,159
Well, I reckon I'm the
authorities around here, fella.

789
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,230
The real police!

790
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,708
Aggravation I do not need!

791
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,904
Hey!

792
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,545
Are you insane?

793
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,025
I'm gonna get fired!

794
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,279
You got to be out
of your damn mind!

795
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,319
Drunk driver, you almost... oh.

796
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,279
Almost?

797
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,226
I'm just gonna...

798
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,950
I'm just gonna go, all right?

799
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,181
Sandy.

800
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,946
Sandy!

801
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,119
- Charlie, what are you doing?
- This ends now.

802
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,119
Charlie!

803
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,519
- Run!
- No!

804
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,559
Sandy!

805
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,221
Jake!

806
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,439
Jake, I don't know what he's doing.

807
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,068
Stay back you son of a bitch!

808
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,025
Oh my God!

809
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:20,159
No! Please! No!

810
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,469
No!

811
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,559
Help.

812
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,399
I'll see you at Abby's house.

813
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,584
Be there.

814
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,709
Where are you?

815
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,704
I thought you might be here.

816
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,159
I want my lawyer.

817
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,823
I'm not taking you in,
not like that anyway.

818
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,159
So what then?

819
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,119
Have you spoken to Mr. Tilton?

820
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,559
No, but he didn't do it.

821
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,119
You weren't so sure the other day.

822
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,039
I am now.

823
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,871
It wasn't him.

824
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,589
Well, I believe you.

825
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:03,591
Do you know someone
named Anthony Cobb?

826
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,039
Oh, God.

827
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:12,519
Look, I want to take you to a
safe location, somewhere we can

828
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,199
keep our eyes on you, protect you.

829
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,719
- What about Jake?
- Him, too.

830
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,621
It's going to be all right.

831
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,119
Why is all this happening?

832
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:30,559
It's hard to say, but the awful
truth is bad things happen

833
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,791
all the time,
especially around here.

834
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,679
I just want to...

835
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,639
I just want to make sure
nothing happens to you

836
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,790
if you come with me, all right?

837
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,999
Okay.

838
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,599
Let me get my stuff.

839
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,625
All right.

840
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,141
No!

841
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,587
Hey!

842
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,270
Yeah, I'm talking to you!

843
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,439
What the hell is that?

844
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,599
You just put that lady
in the trash can, man.

845
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,831
I don't care where you're from.
That's bad manners.

846
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,039
So, here's what's gonna happen.

847
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,439
Once you let her out of that
trash can what you are gonna do,

848
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,119
my friend, I'm gonna teach
you a thing or two about

849
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,941
proper etiquette with the ladies.

850
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,119
Let's rock.

851
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,906
Let's roll.

852
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,590
Oh no!

853
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,665
No!

854
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,549
Is somebody there?

855
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,039
Hey, are you all right?

856
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,559
- Yeah.
- Where's Cobb?

857
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,079
He's inside.

858
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,799
I heard him and screaming.

859
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,159
He killed a cop, Jake.

860
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,039
Yeah, something bad
happened to him.

861
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,271
I don't really know
how to explain it.

862
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,509
What is that?

863
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,270
It's what started it.

864
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,549
Now, I'm gonna end it.

865
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,585
Abby.

866
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,142
You asked me to be
here, and here I am.

867
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,588
Please don't do anything.

868
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,590
Listen, just let her go.

869
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,159
Let her go.

870
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:20,903
My son!

871
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,670
Okay.

872
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,704
Is this what you want?

873
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,230
I brought it.

874
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,064
You want your wish,

875
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:51,590
but Tony, it ruins things, man.

876
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,119
It takes what you want,

877
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,590
and it ruins it just
like it ruined you.

878
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,439
You were right at the bar the
other night when you told me

879
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:06,239
that I didn't appreciate anything.

880
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,359
I was taking it all for granted.

881
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:11,943
My job. My family.

882
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,185
My friend.

883
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,599
Look around.
This is all my fault.

884
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,159
This isn't on anyone else.
This is on me, man.

885
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:26,061
My Son!

886
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,590
Okay.

887
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,705
No.

888
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,110
I wish my friend,

889
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,509
Tony Cobb...

890
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,548
had his soul back.

891
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:10,745
No!

892
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,068
Go inside!
Fast!

893
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,748
Tony, let me in!

894
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,559
Tony!

895
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,585
Open the door!

896
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,744
Open this door right now!

897
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,949
No!

898
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,589
Please don't!

899
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,519
Tony, don't. No.
This isn't you.

900
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,704
This is not you.

901
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,586
Abby.

902
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,863
I just want to take my boy fishing.

903
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,582
I am so...

904
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,190
so sorry.

905
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,987
Come on.
Stay with me, Jake.

906
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:53,185
Jake.

907
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,519
Where am I?

908
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,079
Everything's gonna
be all right, sir.

909
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,719
Take over a man's life.

910
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,585
The paw.

911
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,550
Where's the paw?

912
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,585
Where's the paw?

913
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,719
The paw.

914
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,279
Sir, it's a part of your life.

915
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,719
No. You're not listening.
Where's the paw?

916
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,159
Sir, calm down.

917
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,946
No, no.

918
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,901
No!

919
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,586
Where's the paw?

920
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,399
You buckled up?

921
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,504
Yep.

921
01:25:29,305 --> 01:26:29,865
