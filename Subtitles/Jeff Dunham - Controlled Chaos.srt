and Achmed's late.

3
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:07,906
Maybe he drowned trying

4
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,942
to visit Bin Laden's grave.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,944
(laughing)

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,278
Security.

7
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,780
That's my name.

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,015
Don't wear it out.

9
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,816
Bubba J?

10
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:20,219
Yeah. Well, gotta go.
Beer break.

11
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,787
Wait. Achmed's late.
Keep an eye out for him.

12
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,422
Which eye?

13
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,425
Where could he be?

14
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,960
He went from dead terrorist

15
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,795
to Hollywood diva.

16
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,330
I'm telling you,

17
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,965
the fame went to his skull.

18
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,134
Achmed? No way.

19
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,205
(engine revving)

20
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,349

00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,069
Huh?

24
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,076
(growls)

25
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,079
(bleating)

26
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,346
Ah.

27
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,583

28
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,159
(evil laughter)

29
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,966
Achmed's here.

30
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,801
I'll go park his car,
since there's

31
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,304
no law against drunk parking.

32
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,506
Thanks, Bubba J.
Good job.

33
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,974
(loud belch)

34
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,609
(belching continues)

35
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,583
Whoa. Is that a hybrid?

36
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,885
It's the AchmedMobile,
you idiot.

37
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,421
Just be careful parking it
or I keel you.

38
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,193
Didn't hurt.

39
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,495
And whatever you do,

40
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,096
don't touch the red button.

41
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,965
Got it. Touch the red button.

42
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:13,999
Yes.

43
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,034
(alarm blaring)
(gasps)

44
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,712
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage,

45
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,348
Jeff Dunham!

46
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,384
(cheering and applause)

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,268
Thank you.

48
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,970
Thank you so much.

49
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,839
(cheering continues)

50
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,645
Ladi and gentlemen,
it's absolutely great to be here

51
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,915
in lovely Richmond, Virginia.

52
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,816
(cheering)

53
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,721
And, you know, we--

54
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,757
I've been doing this show
all over the country,

55
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,091
just having a blast
here, there and everywhere.

56
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,660
The fans are great.

57
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,795
But we've also been taking
my show around the world.

58
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,630
We've been doing shows
in South Africa, Australia,

59
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,799
three tours of Europe
and the U.K.

60
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,534
Now they're talking
about taking me to China.

61
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,703
Wha-What?
(laughter)

62
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,372
How am I going to do
my show in China?

63
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,075
All I know is, if I do
do my show in China,

64
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,345
there's a big chunk of my act
I'm going to have to leave out.

65
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,947
(laughter)

66
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,816
You'll recognize it when I do it
here this evening.

67
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,118
(laughter)

68
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,589
But it is interesting going to
some of these foreign countries

69
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,024
and doing press interviews,
because some of the reporters

70
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,459
have done their
homework and care,

71
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,994
others just don't.

72
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,029
For example, I was in London
talking to a guy

73
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,464
and he was like,

74
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,566
(British accent):
"All right, so ventriloquism--

75
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,769
have you eliminated every other
possibility of employment?"

76
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,974
And I have to go, "No, this is
what I've done my entire life."

77
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,942
I've never wanted to do
anything else.

78
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,911
I started very young.

79
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,347
I was eight years old,
I was in the third grade,

80
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,581
Christmas, 1970.

81
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,383
Got my first dummy.

82
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,519
There's Mom and Dad and me
under the tree right there.

83
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,823
You can see how
proud my father is.

84
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,125
(laughter)

85
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,827
But for years
I'd look at that picture

86
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,229
and I'd think, why does he have
that expression on his face?

87
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,365
And then if finally hit me, duh,
look where the dummy's hand is.

88
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,035
So...
(laughter)

89
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,371
Yeah, that's creepy.

90
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,939
So I started doing shows
very early.

91
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,507
All the way through
elementary school, junior high,

92
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,742
high school, college.

93
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,410
And this is what I wanted to do.

94
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,711
This was the future I saw.

95
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,046
I saw it.

96
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,881
There were a few people
that didn't see it.

97
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,850
For example, girlfriends.

98
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,985
They'd realize I was sincere

99
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,289
about wanting to talk
to dummies the rest of my life

100
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,157
and they would dump me
immediately.

101
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,193
I couldn't see what they saw
until a few months ago.

102
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,895
I was sitting down
with my three daughters,

103
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,263
and we were looking
at the yearbooks

104
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,865
from my junior high
and high school years.

105
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,433
My daughters were horrified.

106
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,469
Why? Let me explain.

107
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,706
I started getting paid for doing
my shows in the seventh grade.

108
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,608
And I knew
that if I was going to be

109
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,144
a professional ventriloquist,
I needed a professional photo.

110
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,612
Now, my parents were supportive,

111
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,148
but they weren't going
to shell out the cash for that.

112
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,317
So I thought, how am I going
to get a professional picture

113
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,852
of me and the dummy taken?

114
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,922
And then it finally hit me--
school picture day.

115
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,957
(laughter)

116
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,293
(applause)

117
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,095
Don't believe me? There's
seventh grade right there.

118
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,164
There it is.

119
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,700
(cheering and applause)

120
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,469
Look at that. That is
Justin Bieber hair, damn it.

121
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,405
(cheering)

122
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,742
So ninth grade came along and
I decided to do the same thing.

123
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,511
This was the bicentennial year
in our country-- 1976.

124
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,547
I was a patriotic lad,

125
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,482
but I didn't want to dress
like Uncle Sam.

126
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,117
No, apparently I wanted
to dress like

127
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,119
a Fourth of July
picnic table cover.

128
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,021
(laughter)

129
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,660
(applause and cheering)

130
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,399
You know, the funniest thing
to me

131
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,768
about that photo is the fact
that I have braces.

132
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,470
Why is that funny?
Well, the rest of my life

133
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,004
I'm going to be talking
with my mouth shut,

134
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,207
so what's the point?

135
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,275
(laughter)

136
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,412
I know most of you look
at these photos and think,

137
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,681
this is the saddest human being
we've ever met.

138
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,249
Did he have any friends?

139
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,717
Yes, I did.

140
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,186
Here we are sitting
in my bedroom one day.

141
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,056
So now I had about 15 minutes
in my show.

142
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,792
I knew I wanted to add
something else-- some variety.

143
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,927
I thought, music? Yes.
Something cool.

144
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,462
Rock and roll guitar?

145
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,031
No, something cooler.
I'll play the trombone.

146
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,268
(laughter)

147
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,972
There is so much wrong here,
ladies and gentlemen.

148
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,607
Let's start
with the least obvious,

149
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,542
and that's my dummy
up in the corner

150
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,112
listening to me play
the trombone, but...

151
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,949
Now let's talk
about fashion, shall we?

152
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,885
(laughter)

153
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,388
How did my mother even let me
out of the house?

154
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,924
And this wasn't some accident
on a Saturday morning

155
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,026
where I accidentally threw on
the wrong clothes.

156
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,496
This was an outfit I wore
to school regularly.

157
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:15,600
I don't know why I didn't get
beat up on a regular basis.

158
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,502
I must have gone to the store
and said,

159
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,539
"Do you have any pants that
don't even go with themselves?"

160
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,108
(laughter)

161
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,643
This next photograph--

162
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,945
I don't remember
how it happened.

163
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,482
All I know is that we went to
the professional portrait studio

164
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,919
and this was the family portrait
that hung in our living room

165
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,787
this big, for years.

166
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,156
(laughter)

167
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,260
(cheering and applause)

168
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,732
(whistling, cheering, applause)

169
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,243
You know, maybe... (laughing)

170
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,048
And the weird part is my parents
had family and friends over

171
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,217
for parties a lot.

172
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,385
And this was hanging right there
in plain view.

173
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,721
No one ever said anything.

174
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,224
They must have thought,
"Well, the food's good.

175
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,727
Let's go to the mentally
ill people's house."

176
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,563
And now it's time
to move on to college

177
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,265
and the intellectual years.

178
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,577
I don't even,
I don't even know why.

179
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,446
You know, the photographer
should have

180
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,915
just fallen over laughing.
I don't...

181
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,783
I looked like Sherlock Holmes
with a dummy.

182
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,986
I don't know what that is.

183
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,556
You know, I love my parents
very much,

184
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,026
and they have been married
for 56 years now.

185
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,961
(audience cheering)

186
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,470
And they are a perfect example
of how a marriage can work.

187
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,805
On the other hand, I've recently
gone through something

188
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,275
that I never thought I'd go
through, never considered it,

189
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,143
never even thought it
a possibility.

190
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,611
I'm recently divorced.

191
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,179
I'm a single father now,

192
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,415
but I always try and look
for the silver lining

193
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,584
in the dark clouds, and one
of the silver linings

194
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,521
about getting divorced is that
I got to pick out my own house

195
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,658
because someone else has
the other house now.

196
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,662
As for my act,
there's an old guy,

197
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,566
who long before I got married,
warned me of the institution.

198
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,135
And now I guess he can say,
"I told you so."

199
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,037
Ladies and gentlemen,

200
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,573
please help me welcome
my oldriend Walter.

201
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,508
(audience cheering)

202
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,424
Holy crap, will you shut
the hell up?!

203
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,458
(Jeff chuckles)

204
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,428
You, too.

205
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,562
Are you all right?

206
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,663
No!
What's wrong?

207
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,798
I'm pissed.

208
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,767
Why?
I have no idea.

209
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,536
Well, have you ever
thought about being happy?

210
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,704
Yeah.
What happened?

211
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,374
It pissed me off.

212
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,809
What would happen
if you were happy?

213
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,544
Your show would suck.

214
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,912
(laughter)

215
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,350
You know, Walter,
just once

216
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,218
I think you should
try being happy.

217
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,386
You're an idiot.
(chuckles)

218
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,321
See? What the hell
is wrong with you?

219
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,390
When I call you
an idiot, and you smile,

220
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,925
like I gave you cake.

221
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,327
Do you want to be
in a good mood?

222
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,431
Not if I'd look like a moron
like you, no, thank you.

223
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,467
I've seen you walk by
perfect strangers

224
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,202
and go, "Oh, hello.
How are you?

225
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,104
Hoo-hoo-hoo!"

226
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,639
So?

227
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,643
That makes mothers hide
their children from you.

228
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,979
You don't think
I should be nice
to strangers?

229
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,215
You know, even dogs
sniff (bleep) first.

230
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,685
(howling with laughter)

231
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,925
Well, I'm just happy
to be here tonight.

232
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:05,130
Not in the winter. Holy crap.

233
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,965
I don't know.
I hate being cold.

234
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,401
I even got cold
in Vegas last week.

235
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,403
Oh, Vegas, yeah. You
took your wife there.

236
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,038
Oh, yeah.
You know, Vegas
has become

237
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,639
a great vacation
spot for families.

238
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,008
Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.

239
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,244
That makes sense.
Take the family to Vegas.

240
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,311
Yeah.

241
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,082
'Cause kids love whores.

242
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,316
(laughter)

243
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,321
"Look, Mommy,
there's a place with poles

244
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,525
like where you used to work."

245
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,260
(laughter)

246
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,299
So, Walter, you been
doing anything fun

247
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,400
since we got here?

248
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,302
Uh, yeah. What did I do today?

249
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,304
I did something fun.
What?

250
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,275
I signed up Achmed
to be an organ donor.

251
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,111
Oh, that's funny
as hell right there.

252
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,612
I'm getting sick
of that guy.

253
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,182
I think all this fame
is going to his head.
Why?

254
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,617
He's been doing all
the typical Hollywood stuff.

255
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,721
Like what?
He's been dating
a goat half his age.

256
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,325
Oh, yeah, an actual goat.

257
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,795
He even got her fake teats.

258
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,466
Oh, yeah, all six of 'em.

259
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,137
Walter, a goat
only has two.
(chuckles)

260
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:28,713
How sick is it that you
actually know that?

261
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,682
What, are you so lonely now,

262
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,083
you're checking out
barnyard animals?

263
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,454
You know, they're
called "petting zoos,"

264
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,124
not "heavy petting zoos."

265
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,762
Come on.
What's her name?

266
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,164
(bleating):
Ma-a-argaret.
Will you...?!

267
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,732
(laughter)

268
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,608
Can we change the subject?

269
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,444
Sur-ur-ure.

270
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,246
I'll change the subject,
all right.

271
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,914
I heard you talking
about something

272
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,549
you hadn't really discussed
onstage yet.

273
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,984
Right.
Okay.

274
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,153
So you're talking
about the divorce now.
Yeah.

275
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,588
All those years
of being married,

276
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,190
and now it's over.

277
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,358
Yeah.

278
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,261
So, all those years
of raising the girls,

279
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,164
and now the family's
broken up.

280
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,265
Right.

281
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,634
So, no more marriage?
Nope.

282
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,036
No more wife.
No.

283
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,405
What's it like?!

284
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,842
(loud, uncontrollable laughter)

285
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,153
Oh, please let me live
vicariously through you!

286
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,354
(laughter)

287
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,423
Walter, divorce is
not a good thing.

288
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,926
Oh, you can't lie
to me, (bleep).

289
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,030
So what happened?

290
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,032
What happened, Walter,
is that, unfortunately,

291
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,333
in our country these days,

292
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,902
more than 50% of marriages
now end in divorce,

293
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,171
and sadly, mine
was on that side
of things.

294
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,973
(voice breaking):
You know, Jeff, I never thought

295
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,042
I'd say this to you,
but you're my hero!

296
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,946
Come on.
What's it like

297
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,316
to wake up in the morning
and not hate your life?

298
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,184
To not think,
"Uh-oh, here she comes!"

299
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,686
Ugh!

300
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,260
You can leave your toilet
seat up all the time!

301
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,663
I'd hot-glue mine open,
for God's sakes...

302
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,166
and then (bleep)
in the backyard.

303
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,843
Just because I could.

304
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,812
Walter, divorce
is painful.

305
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,215
Oh, yeah, like
a deep-tissue massage.

306
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,516
(screams)

307
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,252
(sighs contentedly)

308
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,488
So how long's it been?

309
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,890
Almost three years now.

310
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,959
Oh, okay. So, you
dating anybody now?

311
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,361
Matter of fact, I am.

312
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,263
Oh, good. Female?

313
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,100
Well, you never know.

314
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,303
Sometimes that's the problem.

315
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,305
"Honey, I got bad news
and I got good news.

316
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,007
"Bad news is,
I want a divorce.

317
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,709
Good news is, I'm
on your team now!"

318
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,446
(audience laughs)

319
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,383
Come on, let's knit, Mitch!

320
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,990
So this girl you're dating,
is she the same age as you?

321
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,226
No.
Oh. So she's older.

322
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,727
No.
(gasps)
Younger.

323
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,195
Yes.
How much younger?

324
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,332
It doesn't matter.
Yes, it does.

325
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,069
Come on. Does she
have nice boobs?

326
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:44,242
That don't hang down
past her knees?

327
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,046
¶ Do your boobs hang low,
do they wobble to and fro? ¶

328
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,284
(audience laughs, whistles)

329
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,153
¶ Can you tie 'em in a knot? ¶

330
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,022
¶ Can you tie 'em in a bow? ¶

331
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,824
¶ Can you throw 'em
o'er your shoulder ¶

332
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,292
¶ Like a Continental soldier? ¶

333
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,062
¶ Do your... ¶
All right!

334
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,697
Where do you hear
a song like that?

335
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,598
I didn't hear it,
I wrote it, dumb(bleep).

336
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,035
Bet you never sung
it to your wife.

337
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,437
Every morning!

338
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,838
(wheezing laugh)

339
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,807
That's not funny.

340
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,543
Oh, even the dog
laughs at that.

341
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,412
(imitates dog howling)

342
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,982
(imitates dog whining)

343
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,724
That last part was me.
I know.

344
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,093
You know, I saw an old photo
of you and your wife.

345
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,394
Your wife's quite beautiful.

346
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,897
You saw an old photo.

347
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,733
Yeah, I'm kidding, I know.

348
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,868
I married a petite,
young, beautiful thing.

349
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,636
Yeah.
She was eventually eaten

350
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,206
by the woman I live with now.

351
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,876
(à la Fat Albert):
Hey, hey, hey!

352
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,987
You're just flat-out saying
your wife's overweight.

353
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,489
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

354
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,424
She's under-tall.

355
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,727
Have you ever had
a weight problem?

356
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,031
Only when she sat on me.
Will you...?

357
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,833
Aah!

358
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,436
Get off of me!

359
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,072
Actually, it's more like this:

360
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,941
(imitating an echo)
Hello? ...o...o...o...

361
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:32,517
It's dark in here!
...here...ere...ere...

362
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,320
I found your keys!
...keys...keys...keys...

363
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,024
I am not kidding.

364
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,093
Then she farted and
unlocked the car doors.

365
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,599
What does your wife think
when you do things like this?

366
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,934
I don't care.

367
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,503
Well, I know you care
enough about your wife

368
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,605
to take her on some
of these trips.
Oh, yeah.

369
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,007
Yeah, she loves
going on these trips.

370
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,108
I know she loves
window shopping.

371
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,510
Not in Amsterdam, she didn't.

372
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,913
(cackles)

373
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,383
Ha! Because in Amsterdam,

374
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,087
there's hookers in the windows!

375
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,556
I love that city. Did you
know that in Amsterdam,

376
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,358
you can legally
purchase marijuana?

377
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,194
I, uh... yeah...

378
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,762
I did know that.

379
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,330
Do you know where?
Coffeehouses.

380
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,466
Coffeehouses!

381
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,268
It's my favorite
coffee place ever!

382
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,605
I'd like a latte and a doobie.

383
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,378
And 19 dozen donuts,
thank you.

384
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,380
(laughter)

385
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,216
(applause)

386
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,818
Not long after that,
we went to the UK.

387
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,286
You enjoyed it there.
Yeah.

388
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,754
Did you like the
city of London?

389
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,857
I don't know,
I got confused one day

390
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,758
standing in our hotel lobby.
Why?

391
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,727
Some big old black guy
walked in to me

392
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,963
and started speaking English
with a British accent.

393
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,266
I thought I was in
the Twilight Zone.

394
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,935
I swear, some big old black guy
walks up to me and goes,

395
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,772
(posh British accent):
"Oh, good afternoon, sir!"

396
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,276
I'm like, who the hell is making
you talk? What the hell?

397
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,418
Then we went to Ireland.

398
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,020
I got all confused there.
Why?

399
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,788
Everybody's last name
starts with "O."

400
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,390
O'Malley, O'Shea.

401
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,359
I think I know
a black Irish guy.
Who's that?

402
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,994
O'Bama.

403
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,996
(laughter)

404
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,837
I don't think Obama's Irish.

405
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,173
Maybe he's half-Irish,
half-African American.

406
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,607
I can't wait to meet him.

407
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,242
I'm going to walk up and go,

408
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,611
"Hey, top of the morning
to you there, dawg."

409
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,614
(laughter)

410
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,651
"How's your health care
hangin', yo-yo?"

411
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:52,023
"Hey, that last election
was a bee-yotch."

412
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,625
Say good night, Walter.
Thank you.

413
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,227
That's Walter.
There we go.

414
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,029
(cheering and applause)

415
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,699
(cheering and applause)

416
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,705
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

417
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,840
there is a terrorist
amongst us.

418
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,410
(cheering and whistling)

419
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,685
And I don't know
how it's gotten to the point

420
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,287
that I can actually give this
introduction, but here it is.

421
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,655
Please help me welcome

422
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,657
the most beloved terrorist
throughout the world--

423
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,426
Achmed the dead terrorist.

424
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,361
(cheering and applause)

425
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,241
(evil laughter)

426
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,479
Greetings, infidels!

427
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,880
(cheering and whistling)

428
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,985
And for the folks who
might not know, Achmed,

429
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,720
you are a suicide bomber.

430
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,188
Yes, I am.

431
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,558
Don't stand too close.

432
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,461
(evil laughter)

433
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,763
And I think a lot of us
might like to know

434
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,865
how you feel about
the death of Osama.

435
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,533
(gasps)
I didn't do it.

436
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,168
(laughter)

437
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,971
I didn't say you did.

438
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,173
Oh, right.
Yeah, uh-huh.

439
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,775
(laughing):
All right, yeah, yeah.

440
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,210
Wait a minute.

441
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,978
Did you have something
to do with it?

442
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:21,979
Yeah... No!

443
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,181
Yes... No, no, no... no!

444
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,118
That Navy SEAL training
was just for laughs.

445
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,086
(giggling)

446
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,322
Wait a minute, you
trained as a Navy SEAL?

447
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,690
No... Ye... No! No!

448
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,191
How did you know?

449
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,793
Who said anything
about Navy SEALS?

450
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,395
I'm just a simple
little terrorist.

451
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,031
Stop interrogating me!
Damn it, you're good at this!

452
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,599
(laughter)

453
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,167
You're not going to tell
anyone, right?

454
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,036
Tell them what?

455
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,505
Oh, thank you.

456
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,341
I will tell you what
I do know, though.

457
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,609
What's that?

458
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,943
When Bin Laden died,

459
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:57,114
there were no 72 virgins
waiting for him.

460
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,750
(laughter and applause)

461
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,492
No?

462
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,096
No. It was some kind
of misunderstanding.

463
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,000
Turned out, it was one
72-year-old virgin.

464
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,669
(laughter)

465
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,873
Osama is stuck forever
with Bea Arthur.

466
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,775
(laughter)

467
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,114
And Osama and I agree that
that 72 virgin thing

468
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,649
is highly overrated.

469
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,017
How's that?

470
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,785
Who wants to hear
this 72 times?

471
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,122
"Ooh, ow, oh! Boo-hoo-hoo!

472
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,992
You're gonna call me, right?"

473
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,894
(laughter)

474
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,599
Wait a minute.

475
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,167
Wait a minute. You
communicate with Osama?

476
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,535
Of course.
How?

477
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,604
On Face-Shot-Off-Book.

478
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,373
(laughter)

479
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,111
So...

480
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,382
(cheering, applause
and whistling)

481
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,283
So, where... where
exactly is he?

482
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,387
Well, he won't say, but
I'm pretty sure it's Hell.

483
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,288
Why do you say that?

484
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,425
Well, they get cable,
but they only get one channel.

485
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:18,329
What?
The Oprah Winfrey Network.

486
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,831
Wait a minute.

487
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,067
(laughter and applause)

488
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,703
Come on, Achmed, a lot of people

489
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,138
love Oprah.

490
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,973
Were you ever
on her show?

491
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,077
No.
She doesn't love you.

492
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,979
And also I know why

493
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,149
they would not show
the photo of dead Osama.

494
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,483
Why is that?

495
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,951
It's a little
hard to explain,

496
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,621
but when he was killed,
he was dressed up like Cher.

497
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,322
(laughter)

498
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,159
Well, since he's dead,

499
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,161
do you think they're going
to come after you now?

500
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,362
(laughing)

501
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,130
Wait, what?

502
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,566
Well, you're
a terrorist.

503
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,902
Yeah, but I suck at it.

504
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,171
You know, the military
has the deck of cards

505
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,107
of the 52
most wanted terrorists.

506
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,442
Are you one
of those?

507
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,445
Yeah, but I'm in
the Go-Fish deck.

508
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,879
(laughter)

509
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,415
Well, what did you think
about them burying him at sea?

510
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,883
I think it's cool

511
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,919
that he could
end up anywhere.

512
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,353
What do you mean?

513
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,290
<i>That is one episode
of SpongeBob I got to see.</i>

514
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,858
(laughter)

515
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,526
(cackling)

516
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,728
I wrote that. I keel me.

517
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,572
Achmed, since you're
clearly a terrorist,

518
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,173
are you Muslim?

519
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,108
No. Scientologist.

520
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,412
(laughter)

521
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,813
But you used
to be Muslim?

522
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,748
No. Look at me.

523
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,250
I'm too extreme.

524
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,886
I was Catholic.

525
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,254
(laughter)

526
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,489
Really?

527
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,357
And Methodist...
What?

528
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,525
Buddhist...
What?

529
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,893
And Baptist...
What?

530
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,928
And Capricorn.
Wait a minute.

531
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,296
What are you doing?

532
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,333
I'm trying to offend
as many infidels as possible.

533
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,368
(evil laughter)

534
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,437
And speaking of offending,

535
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,473
do you know what that
idiot Peanut did to me?

536
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,774
What?

537
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,610
He stole my ShamWow.

538
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,211
(laughter)

539
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,248
It's not funny!

540
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,917
Silence!

541
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,453
(laughter)

542
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,090
Wait for it.

543
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,359
(uproarious laughter)

544
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,261
(cheering)

545
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,566
I keel you!

546
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:39,336
(cheering and applause)

547
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,874
That's fantastic.

548
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,710
Let's do it together.
One, two, three...

549
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,946
ALL:
I keel you!

550
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,648
They're talking to you.

551
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,349
(laughter)

552
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,251
So, Achmed, are you
enjoying Richmond?

553
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,520
Oh, I love the nightlife here.

554
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,988
Uh, what part of
the nightlife?

555
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,191
They have live sex shows.

556
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,527
Really? Where?

557
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,063
In the hotel room
right next to mine.

558
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,665
(laughter)

559
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,276
(laughter)

560
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,178
What?

561
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,813
That's my room.

562
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,623
(cheering and whistling)

563
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,967
Next time you should
get a partner.

564
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,669
(laughter)

565
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,908
Can we talk about
something else?

566
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,142
I'm trying to throw up,

567
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,111
but I don't have a stomach.

568
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,779
(laughter)

569
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,314
So, look,
Walter and I

570
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,183
were talking earlier,

571
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,619
and you've gotten
pretty famous now
lately, haven't you?

572
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,853
Oh, yes.

573
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,221
And I think very soon,

574
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,956
I'm going to need
my own posse.

575
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,693
That's with an "O."

576
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,396
(laughter)

577
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,735
Po-o-o-sse.

578
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,639
P-P-oo...

579
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,641
..osse.

580
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,410
Posse.

581
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,445
Why are you explaining that?

582
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,482
In Amsterdam, they thought
I said something else.

583
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,917
(laughter)

584
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,688
I don't even like cats.

585
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,623
(laughter and applause)

586
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,729
P-P-o... P-P-o...

587
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,164
P-P-o...

588
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,166
P-P-P-o...

589
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,901
P-P-o...

590
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,703
P-P...

591
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,972
P-P-P...

592
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,909
How am I doing that
with no lips?

593
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,812
(laughter)

594
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,149
(cheering and applause)

595
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,023
That's what she said.

596
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,025
(cackling)
(laughter)

597
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,036
I can't believe you did that.

598
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,372
That's what she said.

599
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,441
(laughter)

600
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,875
Will you stop it?

601
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,610
That's what she said!

602
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,579
I don't like this.

603
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:36,880
(squealing):
That's what she said!

604
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,882
(laughter)

605
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,990
How long is this?

606
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,059
(high-pitched squealing):
That's what she said!

607
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,629
(loud laughter and applause)

608
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,048
Think about it.

609
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,955
So you were talking
to Walter earlier?

610
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,726
Damn it!

611
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,962
Yes, and I said,

612
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:29,233
"I'm going to call
you my bee-yotch."

613
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,902
That means "bitch."

614
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,870
I know that.

615
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,004
I'm sorry.

616
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,072
<i>I'd been watching
Pimp My Camel.</i>

617
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,344
eem like you've been
in a pretty good mood lately.

618
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,512
Do you know why?

619
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,180
No.
Because like
Santa Claus,

620
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,582
I have been making
a list of people

621
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,785
to kill twice.

622
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,186
Santa doesn't kill people.

623
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,856
He does if he's
Terror Claus.

624
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,558
Terror Claus?
I've never heard of him.

625
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,927
¶ Oh... ¶

626
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:01,331
¶ He kills you
when you're sleeping ¶

627
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,170
¶ He chokes you when you wake ¶

628
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,173
¶ He knows if you are Catholic
or Jew ¶

629
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,809
¶ So denounce
your infidel faith. ¶

630
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,710
(laughter and cheers)

631
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,920
That's terrible.

632
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,155
But catchy!

633
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,424
Have you heard
of the Terror Bunny?

634
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,860
No.
He hides Easter bombs.

635
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:33,897
Look, Mommy.
(mimics explosion)

636
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,701
That's even worse.

637
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,671
I know.
Thank you for noticing.

638
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,773
What do you want,
more stinking knock-knock jokes?

639
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,974
That might be better.

640
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,242
Okay. Knock-knock.
Who's there?

641
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,710
Me. I keel you again.

642
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,212
(laughs)

643
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,646
You're such an idiot.

644
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,082
You keep answering
the door!

645
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,183
Where I am from,

646
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,751
the game we teach
our children is,

647
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:55,953
when someone says,
"Knock-knock,"

648
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,355
you shut (bleep)
and hide.

649
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,230
So, Achmed, did your
parents have much

650
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,798
to do with what you do now?

651
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,066
Well, uh, I guess so.

652
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,934
My father was
a suicide bomber.

653
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,636
Oh, so you guys
are a lot alike?

654
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,204
Well, I have his eyes.

655
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,243
In a box.

656
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,979
And I like to hide them
wherever Walter is sleeping.

657
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,347
That way, when
he wakes up,

658
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,848
it scares
the crap out of him.

659
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,217
WALTER (distant):
You son of a bitch,

660
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,953
I'll kick your
ass right now!

661
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,889
(applause and cheering)

662
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,097
Is that case locked
from the outside?

663
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,331
Yeah. Why?

664
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,901
'Cause he still scares
the crap out of me!

665
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,135
So, Achmed,
do you have

666
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,703
any good memories
of your father?

667
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,205
Uh, for my eighth
birthday,

668
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,207
he got me a puppy.
That's good.

669
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,576
No, it turned into a disaster.
Why?

670
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,711
Because sometimes my father was

671
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,779
a very confused man,

672
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,481
and that day
my mother told him

673
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,883
to go outside and blow up
some party balloons.
Yeah?

674
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,855
(sadly):
And that's how I got
a dog with no legs.

675
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,556
You had a dog
with no legs?

676
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,791
Yeah, he was great.

677
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,359
I had him
for many years.

678
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,194
Oh. So what'd
you call him?

679
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,234
Seriously?

680
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,272
Seriously.

681
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,307
What?

682
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,575
I had a dog with no legs.

683
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,913
What did you call him?

684
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,117
Seriously?

685
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,187
Okay, you're
a comedian, right?

686
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,422
Yeah.

687
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,791
I had a dog

688
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,293
with no legs.

689
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:48,098
(sinisterly): Ask me again.

690
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,415
What'd you call him?

691
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:10,020
I didn't call him anything
because he could never come.

692
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,557
It's not funny!

693
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,462
Achmed, that's, that's, like,
the oldest joke ever.

694
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,631
(voice breaking):
Yes, but in my case,
it was true.

695
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,367
AUDIENCE: Aw...

696
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,236
Thanks.

697
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,339
Could he do
any tricks?

698
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,420
He could roll over.

699
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,723
It not funny because if there
is any kind of an incline,

700
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,659
he couldn't stop himself!

701
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,162
He looked like a runaway
can of pinto beans

702
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,498
rolling down a hill.

703
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:58,135
It was the only time
I ever saw a cat
actually laugh.

704
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,870
Meow. (hiccups)

705
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,038
Meow. (hiccups) Meow. (hiccups)

706
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,206
(faster) Mw. (hiccups)
Meow. (hiccups)

707
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,208
(gasping groan)

708
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,676
What was that?

709
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,678
I killed
the (bleep) cat.

710
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,950
So, Achmed, when did
you know you wanted

711
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,185
to be a suicide bomber?

712
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,655
After talking
to my guidance counselor.

713
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,689
Your guidance counselor?

714
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,024
In high school.
High school?

715
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,560
Al Qaeda High.

716
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,028
Al Qaeda High?

717
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,330
¶ Oh... ¶

718
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,868
¶ All hail
to the Al Qaeda High ¶

719
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:35,906
¶ We blow up,
then we die. ¶

720
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,274
Everybody!

721
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,975
Wait, wait, wait. This is
your high school?

722
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,177
Who was your mascot?

723
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,478
The next guy
on the list.

724
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,119
Oh, it was, like,

725
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,922
"Go, team!
(mimics explosion)

726
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,324
Next.

727
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,959
So how were
the cheerleaders
at your school?

728
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,260
Oh, we didn't even
have girls.

729
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,695
No girls?

730
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,731
No. But for some reason,
we had a girls' restroom.

731
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,133
I see.

732
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,036
And one day, Omar and I
snuck in there to explore.

733
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,271
The girls' restroom?
Uh-huh.

734
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,473
And what'd you find?

735
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,442
A couple of strange
and wonderful things.

736
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,410
Like what?

737
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,746
Well, we found a machine.

738
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:20,083
And if you put
two shekels in it,

739
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,018
a small missile would come out.

740
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,262
A missile?
Well, I think it was.

741
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,197
It had a little white fuse.

742
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,471
And it must have been
a very special missile,

743
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,740
because it was lightly scented.

744
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,879
And then you could put two
shekels in the other machine

745
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:52,282
and get the bonus
accuracy package.

746
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,152
What?
It had wings.

747
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,027
And you used these missiles?

748
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:07,130
With confidence.

749
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:10,133
Really?
Always.

750
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,935
(laughter)

751
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,608
(audience whistling)

752
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,246
Achmed, I've never heard of
anything like this before.

753
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,748
Ooh, do not lie to me, infidel.

754
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,049
I've been to your house,

755
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,484
I've seen in your
cabinets and drawers,

756
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,086
many of these
missiles hidden away.

757
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,822
It looks as though you
are preparing for war.

758
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,995
Every four weeks, it feels
like that, I'd say so.

759
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:43,433
So your soldiers have
synchronized their time clocks.

760
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,036
You could say that.

761
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,772
Well, good luck in your
battles, my friend.
Thank you.

762
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,775
I fear there will
be much bloodshed.

763
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,677
(laughter)

764
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,352
What are the infidels
laughing at now?

765
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,620
I'll explain it
to you later.

766
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,888
I keel you!

767
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,494
, I have a surprise
to share with you tonight.

768
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,798
(gasps)
You're going in the closet?

769
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,733
No, and by the way, the, the,

770
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,435
the phrase is "coming
out of the closet."

771
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:21,571
Oh, congratulations!

772
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,173
No, I'm not coming
out of the closet.

773
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,609
You're going to continue
to hide the truth?

774
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,177
I'm not hiding in anything.

775
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,814
So everyone knows now?
Congratulations!

776
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,482
Achmed, I have a girlfriend.

777
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,218
(gasps)
Does she know?

778
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,921
Maybe she will
like this one guy.

779
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,456
There is no one guy.

780
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,459
Then there are many guys?

781
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:46,863
You are a whore.

782
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,633
Now, you should be stoned.

783
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,967
Achmed...
What would your
mother say?

784
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,369
I'm not a whore.

785
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,005
Of course your mother would
say she's not a whore.

786
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,539
I'm straight.

787
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,275
Straight, crooked,
we do not need

788
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,543
to know such graphic details.

789
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,445
(laughter)

790
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,316
I mean, I have a girlfriend.

791
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,885
Not for long.

792
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,155
Not when she finds out
about your many boyfriends.

793
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,158
Whore!

794
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,494
Will you please listen
to what I'm saying?

795
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,563
I do not talk to whores.

796
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,867
You are dead to me.

797
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,169
You're dead to all of us.

798
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,044
(applause and cheering)

799
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,248
So, Achmed...
I'm not listening!

800
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,116
¶ La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! ¶

801
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,419
Achmed, there's someone here
I want you to meet.

802
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,921
(gasps)
One of your whore boyfriends?

803
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,656
I think not!

804
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,858
<i>No, I think this is someone
you would like to see.</i>

805
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,727
(gasps)
Is it a woman?

806
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:51,795
No.

807
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:56,166
I already have a goat.

808
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,201
This is a surprise guest.

809
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,538
(gasps)
Ryan Seacrest?

810
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:02,939
Nope.
Damn it!

811
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,208
Look. What I want you to
do is, I just want you

812
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,576
to look over there while
I'm getting him out,

813
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,911
so you won't peek.
Okay.

814
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,679
Just look over there.
O... wait a minute.

815
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:13,149
When I'm not looking,
are you going to keel me?

816
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,752
No.
That's actually a good way
of doing it, you know.

817
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,022
Kinda old-school,
but effective.

818
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,858
It's like "Hey, look at that!"
(chokes) Aaah...

819
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,963
No, just look over there, and
don't look back until I say so.

820
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,432
Okay, whever. This is kind
of like Christmas, huh?
Yeah.

821
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,633
Just look over there.
Okay.

822
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,001
And don't peek.
Okay.

823
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,370
Right.
Not gonna peek.
Just stay over here.

824
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,404
Now?
No!

825
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,040
Okay!
(muttering)

826
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,782
(applause and cheering)

827
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,051
(screams)

828
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,486
(yells)

829
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,956
Who the hell is that?

830
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,891
(British accent):
Hello, Father.

831
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,794
(audience whistling, applauding)

832
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,202
(prolonged cheering
and whistling)

833
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,076
It's your son, Achmed Junior.

834
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,046
AJ?

835
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,948
That's right.

836
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,017
ACHMED:
Wait... I thought
you were dead!

837
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,952
Surprise.

838
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,721
This is great.

839
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,056
Hey! What happened
to your face?

840
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:30,593
Oh, yeah.
My bad.

841
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,829
Achmed, he's your son.
Look at him. What do you see?

842
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,497
Well, he does have my eye.

843
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,399
(cackling laugh)

844
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,702
Actually, I do. Yes, I do.

845
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,237
Why do you sound
like Elton John?

846
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,040
When you were separated
after the accident,

847
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,842
he was raised in England.

848
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,377
Did my mum miss me?

849
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:52,182
Uh... yeah. I don't know.
What the hell.

850
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,283
How do you not know?

851
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,218
Oops.

852
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,795
What's wrong
with your leg?

853
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,230
Nothing!

854
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,331
What's wrong
with my leg?

855
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,899
I don't know.

856
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,735
Can you fix this?
No, I don't think so.

857
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,573
Damn it.

858
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,747
Don't look at me.
Sorry.

859
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,317
Um, we're going to get
Marnel to help us.

860
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:28,551
What?
Marnel, he works for me.

861
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,154
I know Mar, Mar,
Marnel!

862
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,089
Come fix my leg!

863
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,526
(murmuring)

864
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,361
Thanks.

865
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,196
(applause)

866
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,099
He's kind of cute.

867
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,575
Okay, moving on!

868
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,512
Wait a minute. How do you
not know who his mother is?

869
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,014
I had 46 wives,
you idiot.

870
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,650
They all dressed the same,
and their faces were covered.

871
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:01,985
How'd you tell them apart?

872
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:05,788
The numbers on their backs.

873
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,557
That's terrible.

874
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:11,060
I know, Mother's Day
is a bitch.

875
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,830
And so are most
of the mothers.

876
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,765
That's not funny at all.

877
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,701
"Atall"?
Who is "Atall"?

878
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,537
Was she your mother?
I don't remember

879
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,139
a woman who was all
bulgy-eyed like you.

880
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,774
Bulgy-eyed?
Well, look at him.

881
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:28,678
Well, you're not
exactly squinting.

882
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,413
At least my face is balanced.

883
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:34,384
You manage to look asleep and
terrified all at the same time.

884
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,853
Achmed, he's your son.
Well, the apple

885
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,354
doesn't fall far
from the tree,

886
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,224
and apparently this one got
run over by a (bleep) lawnmower.

887
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,533
You caused the accident.

888
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,169
Accident? It was
a huge explosion,

889
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,971
with great fire
and destruction.

890
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,240
You didn't mean for
it to happen.
I did, too!

891
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,108
You did not!
No, li...
Oh, (bleep).

892
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,945
Marnel!

893
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,882
Son of a bitch!

894
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,717
Are you talking
to me now?

895
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,458
Fix it right, or
I kick your ass.

896
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:16,459
Marnel!

897
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,861
Come back!

898
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,665
My arm is stuck
in my pelvis, you (bleep).

899
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,172
(laughter, applause
and cheering)

900
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:40,416
<i>He can fix my
pelvis anytime.</i>

901
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,986
Shut up!
Okay, look.

902
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,521
Okay, look. So the explosion
you were talking about,

903
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:46,556
how did it happen?

904
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,491
Very precise and
careful planning.

905
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,360
Not exactly.
I said shut up!

906
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,494
What happened?
Nothing.

907
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:55,765
He was putting gasoline
in his scooter.

908
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,433
So why was there an explosion?

909
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,402
(bleep) happens.

910
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,672
He was using his cell phone.

911
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,307
Really?
What?

912
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,475
While putting gas
in your scooter.

913
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:06,676
You know that's dangerous.

914
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,478
Well, it was your
mother who called.

915
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,947
ACHMED JR.:
Really?
I don't know.

916
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,282
What was her name?
42.

917
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,918
And you guys haven't had
any contact since?

918
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,354
Not much. He's a bad son.
I am not.

919
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,256
Tell him what you sent
me for my birthday.

920
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,624
It was an honest mistake.

921
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:22,959
What'd you send him?

922
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,161
He sent me a bottle
of skin lotion.

923
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,664
(laughter)

924
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,766
He made it worse.
What'd you do?

925
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,334
I sent him back
half a bottle.

926
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,169
(laughing)
(laughter)

927
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,542
You know, maybe you should
try and patch things up.

928
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,379
Looks like he needs more
than a (bleep) patch.

929
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:44,914
But I'm here
for a reason.

930
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,849
What, a skin graft?
Sorry, I'm all out.

931
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,318
(bleep)! Marnel!

932
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:54,123
Come fix my (bleep) leg!

933
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,393
Get duct tape,
you (bleep)!

934
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,363
(chuckling):
He actually brought duct tape.

935
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,867
(laughter and cheering)

936
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,781
He's kinky, too.

937
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,616
Shut up!

938
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:28,191
So, Achmed, do you know
why AJ is here?

939
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,193
Well... Wait a minute.

940
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,529
This isn't some crap about
owing child support, is it?

941
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:34,864
That bitch!

942
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,766
Whichever one she was.
No, that's not...

943
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,801
This is bad,

944
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,970
'cause I've seen the crap
that you're going through

945
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,307
and I don't know how you
can afford even a T-shirt.

946
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:47,110
Thank you.

947
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,512
Did I say that
just how you wrote it?

948
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,414
(laughter)

949
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,619
Yes. Thank you.

950
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,055
Okay. Good luck
with the judge.

951
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:03,292
I hope he's fair.

952
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,461
Actually the judge
is a woman.

953
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,830
You're (bleep).

954
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,732
(laughter)

955
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,635
Okay, listen, you...

956
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,970
Achmed, you're
getting hostile.

957
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,404
Of course I'm
getting hostile.

958
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,306
I'm a terrorist,
you idiot.

959
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,475
You piss me off,
I keel you.

960
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,611
Would that really
solve anything?

961
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:24,347
Pretty much, yeah,
I think it does.

962
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,282
Okay...

963
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,317
I have nothing
in common with
my own son.

964
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,619
Well, just talk to him.
How?

965
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,053
I don't know,
like you would anybody.

966
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,823
Okay, W.T.F.

967
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,458
O.M.G.

968
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,126
I mean O.M.A.

969
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,601
(laughter and applause)

970
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,338
And you have no idea
why he's here?

971
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,974
To start his training
as a terrorist.
No, Father,

972
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:55,044
that's just it-- I don't want
to be a terrorist.

973
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,413
(gasps) But I want you
to be just like me.

974
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,315
Well, I'm not,
and I won't be.

975
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,450
Achmed, can you accept that?

976
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,586
(voice breaking):
I guess I can try.

977
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,689
And, AJ, what if he
doesn't accept it?

978
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,224
I keel you.

979
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,860
That's my boy!

980
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,929
(cheering and applause)

981
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,069
He's purple, he's wacky,
he's been around for a while.

982
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,572
Please help me welcome
my buddy Peanut!

983
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,273
(cheering)

984
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,693
How you doing, Peanut?

985
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,695
Doing pretty good.
How about you?
I'm fine.

986
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,430
That's good, that's good,
that's goo-ood.

987
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,298
(cheering)

988
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,067
Wow.
You like it here?

989
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,535
I love it here.

990
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,803
It's beautiful.
It's sold out.

991
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,137
The place is paid for.

992
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,274
We must be on
an Indian reservation.

993
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,142
And these are all Indians.

994
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,879
Look, Peanut, first of all,

995
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:06,182
the more politically
correct term these days
is Native American.

996
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,684
Oh, yeah.

997
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,220
I certainly wouldn't want
to piss 'em off.

998
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,323
They could try and scalp me,
but all they'd get

999
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,958
is a fishing lure.

1000
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,860
(laughter)

1001
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,368
I guess that is a little less
confusing of a term, though.

1002
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:26,736
What?
Native American.

1003
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,237
Why?
'Cause when you say Indian,

1004
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,172
you don't know which one
the hell they're talking about.

1005
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,741
What?
Is it the ones
that go...

1006
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:32,608
(war chant):
¶ Hy-ya, hy-ya, hy-ya. ¶

1007
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,343
or the ones that go...

1008
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,580
(Indian accent):
Thank you for calling
customer support.

1009
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,483
(laughter and cheering)

1010
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,025
But in this case, I'm talking
about the ones that go...

1011
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,459
(war chant):
¶ Hy-ya. hy-ya, hy-ya. ¶

1012
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,328
(deep voice):
¶ Hy-ya, hy-ya. ¶

1013
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,730
(high-pitched):
¶ Hy-ya, hy-ya... how. ¶

1014
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:56,599
Do you know what
that chant means?

1015
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,634
No, but I think it means,

1016
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:02,438
(chanting):
¶ I forgot the words,
hy-ya, hy-ya. ¶

1017
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,974
You know, we have plenty
of Native Americans
here this evening.

1018
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,276
Oh, goody. Let's play craps.

1019
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,445
(laughter)

1020
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,348
What? They've got
the reservations
and the casinos

1021
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,984
and making millions of dollars
every day hand over fist.

1022
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,886
They're laughing
all the way to the bank.

1023
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:18,788
Oh, that's what it is--
they're laughing.

1024
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,290
(chanting):
¶ Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. ¶

1025
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:22,525
(laughter)

1026
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,497
All right, Peanut, time
to introduce the next guy.

1027
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,800
Oh, dude, does he have
to come out here?

1028
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:31,767
Why not?

1029
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,670
He's a talking jalapeño!

1030
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,939
(audience cheering)

1031
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,276
Go ahead.

1032
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,850
On a stick-k!

1033
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:48,851
So?

1034
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,252
How random is that?

1035
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,188
Well, José, has been in
our act for years.

1036
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,256
I know. And when
folks see us,

1037
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,391
do you know when

1038
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,626
they say the best
time to watch José is?

1039
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:00,296
When?
When they're drunk
off their asses.

1040
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,733
In fact, isn't that how you came
up with him in the first place?

1041
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,900
I don't know.

1042
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,235
But I do know
that's when

1043
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,170
I came up with you.

1044
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,307
You jerk!

1045
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,842
Just introduce him.

1046
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:17,246
Ladies and gentlemen, here is
José Jalapeño on a Stick!

1047
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,148
(audience cheering)

1048
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,166
Good evening, José.

1049
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:38,601
<i>Hola, Señor Jeff.</i>

1050
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:41,637
How are hue...?
Whoops.

1051
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,474
What the hell
was that?

1052
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,810
Were you trying
to say, "How are you?"

1053
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,012
and it came out,
"Haa-a-ah?"

1054
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:58,220
Why is that we speak perfectly
and you (bleep) up?

1055
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,156
(laughter and cheering)

1056
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,561
I don't know.

1057
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,297
Would you like me
to help you?

1058
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:09,532
I'm fine.
Come on.
Follow me

1059
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,666
one word at a time.
No.

1060
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,700
Come on.
Just do it.

1061
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,669
Do it!

1062
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,670
Okay.
Okay.

1063
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,671
How...
How...

1064
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,672
are...
are...

1065
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,673
you-you?
you-you?

1066
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,674
Good-good.
Good-good.

1067
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,608
All right.
All right.

1068
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,610
(audience cheering)

1069
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,383
How are you, José?

1070
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,853
I don't know.
It took too long.

1071
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,355
Actually, I'm
excited, señor.

1072
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,024
Why are you excited, José?

1073
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,992
Probably 'cause
you're holding
his stick.

1074
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,067
Do you have
to do jokes like that?

1075
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,736
It's just weird to me
that in front of everyone,

1076
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,105
you're holding
José's stick-k.

1077
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:51,440
Any suggestions?

1078
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,775
You should at least

1079
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,577
take him out to dinner first.

1080
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,146
It's just a stick.

1081
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,981
Maybe it's actually a handle.

1082
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,316
A handle?

1083
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,251
Yeah, you could use José
as a weapon.

1084
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,986
To hit with?
Yes!

1085
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:07,223
I want to go back in the box.

1086
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,493
No, this is awesome!
"What happened to Frank?"

1087
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,161
"He got whacked
by a jalapeño."

1088
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:15,397
On a stick.
Yes!

1089
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,465
Think about it.

1090
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:20,703
You'd be wielding
a Mexican whacker.

1091
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,806
On a stick.
Yes!

1092
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,342
Look, you know how
Batman had his sidekick Robin

1093
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,177
and one of their weapons
was a batarang?

1094
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,379
Yes, of course.

1095
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,450
Oh, dude.

1096
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:35,584
What?

1097
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,020
You just showed
your geek.

1098
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,088
(sniffs)

1099
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,957
And it smells
like loser.

1100
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,061
You're not
a loser, señor.

1101
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:47,263
Thank you, José.

1102
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,665
Suck-up.

1103
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,901
Muppet reject.

1104
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,335
(laughter)

1105
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,411
Hey, he can drop you,

1106
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,346
and then I'll throw down
a couple avocados.

1107
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:07,416
and we got guacamole!

1108
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,852
I could still burn your ass.

1109
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,322
Good point.

1110
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,523
All right.
(chuckles)

1111
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:15,958
Look...
Wait!

1112
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,560
The Batman thing just made me
think of something.

1113
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,862
What?
If this comedy business
doesn't work out for you,

1114
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,264
Yeah?
you can be
a crime fighter.

1115
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:23,599
A crime fighter?

1116
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:27,937
Yes. You could be
Dunham Man...

1117
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:31,607
with José, your trusty
sidestick. (chortles)

1118
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:35,678
I see. So you're saying
I would be a superhero.

1119
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:38,480
Mm, ...ish.

1120
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,550
"Ish"? It this
like Jewish?

1121
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,386
No, José, you're not Jewish
'cause then you wouldn't be

1122
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,589
José Jalapeño.
You'd be Hymie Jalapeño.

1123
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,893
On a Bagel.
(laughs)

1124
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,163
Where would you
hold him, then?

1125
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,397
(chortles)

1126
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,433
In the hole.

1127
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:05,841
I am not touching that.

1128
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,776
No, you probably never have.

1129
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,878
(audience gasps)

1130
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,584
Okay.

1131
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,453
This sucks!

1132
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,322
So we're a crime-fighting
team, señor?
Yes!

1133
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,258
What kind of crime
do we fight?

1134
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,560
Illegal aliens.

1135
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:28,197
I think there's
a conflict of interest.

1136
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:32,268
Look, so you find the illegals,
whack 'em on the head with José,

1137
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,203
and every time
José hits someone,
he yells...

1138
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,438
<i>Olé.
Yes!</i>

1139
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,540
Pretty cool, huh?

1140
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,675
I guess so.

1141
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:43,178
But, um, do I get
a costume?

1142
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,216
What?

1143
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:59,995
Anything from those
earlier photos.

1144
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,966
I'd go with the
red shorts, señor.

1145
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:07,136
Yeah, then you'd be
Ugly-Ass Crackerman.

1146
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,538
(laughs)

1147
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:10,806
Okay, look, for this
crimefighting thing,

1148
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,274
how's José gonna dress?

1149
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,676
Well, he needs
a disguise.

1150
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,745
Is difficult to
hide a big stick.

1151
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,484
I'm not saying
anything.

1152
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,019
Of course not.
You're still holding it.

1153
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:28,590
José, I don't know how
you put up with this.

1154
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,292
I have nowhere else
to go, señor.
What?

1155
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,427
He was evicted.

1156
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,494
What?
Evicted.

1157
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:33,762
<i>Really?
Yep.
Sí.</i>

1158
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,230
<i>You were evicted?
Sí.</i>

1159
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,499
Why didn't you come
to my house?

1160
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,501
(snickering)

1161
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:44,239
JOSE:
Ask Peanut.

1162
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:47,109
Why didn't he come
to my house?

1163
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,978
We told him you loved
eating Mexican food!

1164
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,185
I was afraid for my life.

1165
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,620
So where'd you take him?

1166
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,689
Taco Bell!

1167
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,925
(laughter)

1168
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,161
That was really mean.

1169
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,330
I know!

1170
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:11,633
Hey, look. What about moving
all of José's stuff?

1171
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,503
Achmed tried to
rent a truck.

1172
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,943
<i>No bueno.</i>

1173
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,278
(chuckles)
So did Walter help?

1174
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,080
He couldn't because
of his war injury.

1175
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,682
Walter has a war injury?

1176
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,185
<i>Yeah, he strained his thumb
playing Call of Duty: Black Ops.</i>

1177
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,589
So you and Achmed
did everything.

1178
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,624
Yep. José didn't lift a finger.

1179
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,959
(laughing)

1180
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:41,597
(laughing):
'Cause he doesn't have any!

1181
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,332
Hey, ever met José's sister?

1182
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,234
Don't do it.
She's really hot.

1183
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:48,437
(shrieking with laughter)

1184
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,406
I'm just kidding, José.

1185
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:55,644
I know. You're
more into fruit.

1186
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,045
Hey!
Hang on, you guys.

1187
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,514
No, you hang on.
What?

1188
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,982
Why are you
laughing at him?

1189
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:02,351
'Cause he's funny.

1190
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,620
Oh, he is, is he?
I know what you're doing.

1191
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,155
I'm not doing anything.

1192
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,024
You're giving José
the better insults.

1193
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,163
I'm just listening.

1194
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:23,305
Don't give me that crap.

1195
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:27,409
We all know
this is all you.

1196
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:31,547
If you get any closer, he's
going to whack you with me.

1197
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,250
Whack.

1198
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,253
Olé!

1199
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:42,524
And that's José Jalapeno
on a Stick!

1200
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:44,460
(applause and cheering)

1201
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,665
Hey.

1202
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,066
Wait a minute!

1203
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,001
I... I forgot to
tell José something.

1204
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,503
Open the box back up.

1205
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:55,871
Immigration!

1206
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,673
Stop it!

1207
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,842
Well, he pissed me off.

1208
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,677
Well, Peanut, it's about
time to end the evening.

1209
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,111
No way!
What?

1210
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,347
I got one more thing to do.
No, the show's about over.

1211
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,949
No, it's not!
I got one more thing.
What?

1212
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,884
Okay, look.
Just trust me on this.

1213
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,452
I have a new hobby.

1214
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,788
A new hobby?
Yes.

1215
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:13,755
What is it?

1216
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,692
I am now a ventriloquist, too.

1217
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:19,761
No, you're not.

1218
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,196
Yes, I am.

1219
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,202
That was...
that was pretty good.

1220
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,537
I know. Compared to me,

1221
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:30,205
you suck.

1222
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,007
Really?

1223
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,509
Let me show you
how it's done.

1224
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,410
Well, you need a dummy.
He's in the box.

1225
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:39,047
You have a dummy?
Over here, señor.

1226
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,449
He's... in the box?
Yeah.

1227
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,717
Right next to José.

1228
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,252
Can I get him out?
Yep.

1229
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:46,455
JOSE:
Don't touch my stick.

1230
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,991
Careful!

1231
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,526
What?

1232
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,930
(whispering):
He's really ugly.

1233
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,799
JOSE:
He is ugly, señor.

1234
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:01,570
He is nasty-looking.

1235
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,406
JOSE: He's so scary,
I wet my stick.

1236
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,478
But he's right here.
He's the only
other guy in there,

1237
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,879
check it out,
look, look, look!

1238
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,749
All right, let's see
this, here we go...

1239
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,853
(cheering and applause)

1240
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,597
I thought
you said he was ugly.

1241
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,799
He is!

1242
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,501
He looks a little like me.

1243
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,637
No... he looks
a lot like you!

1244
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:36,672
This isn't funny.

1245
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,075
Then why is everyone
else laughing?

1246
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,210
JOSE:
I laugh, too, señor.

1247
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:45,013
I laugh so hard
I crack my stick.

1248
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,615
Do you know how to work this?
Of course I do.

1249
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,016
You know there's a little
lever down there...

1250
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,318
I know.
You grab onto the lever....

1251
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:50,719
I know.
and you pull on it...

1252
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,020
I know!
Now, do you have
a hold of the lever?

1253
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,389
He's got a hold of something.

1254
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,627
See, I can do this, too!

1255
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,263
Fantastic.
How are you,
little ugly Jeff?

1256
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,731
Not good.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1257
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,066
You're going to
call him Ugly Jeff?

1258
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,400
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1259
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:08,170
Little Ugly Jeff.

1260
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:09,471
Is there any other name?

1261
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:12,741
Uh, Little Ugly Ass Jeff?

1262
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,510
I like that.

1263
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:16,511
JOSE:
Me, too, senor.

1264
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:17,646
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1265
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,381
Wait a minute.

1266
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,483
I would prefer you didn't
use the word "ass."

1267
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,919
Oh, I didn't really.
It's all one word.

1268
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,221
Little Ugly Ass Jeff.

1269
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,024
Ass Jeff, Ass Jeff,
I am Ass Jeff.

1270
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,060
See? It's good.

1271
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,462
JOSE:
Bravo!
Gracias.
De nada.

1272
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,498
This is ridiculous.

1273
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,567
(cheering)

1274
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,011
So, how are you,
Little Ugly Ass Jeff?

1275
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,679
I'm sad, Handsome Peanut.

1276
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,814
Wait, wait a minute.

1277
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:54,282
Handsome Peanut?

1278
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:59,221
Yes, Peanut is very handsome,
unlike you, Ugly Ass Jeff.

1279
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,622
He is me.
Good point.

1280
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,258
I hate my ugly-ass self.
All right.

1281
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,194
He said he was sad.
I heard him.

1282
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,663
Why are you sad,
Ass Jeff?

1283
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,964
Because I'm a loser.

1284
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,866
Yeah, that is sad.

1285
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,300
And he's ugly.
And I'm ugly.

1286
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:13,301
Thank you.
Is okay.

1287
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:15,604
Will you stop this?

1288
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,739
That's a shame,
Little Ugly Ass Jeff.

1289
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:21,043
I have no idea how I
made it this far in life.

1290
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,545
Me neither.
No one does.

1291
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,648
I suck.
All right.

1292
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,417
Maybe you can make up
for your loserness

1293
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,285
by having a good personality.

1294
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,353
No.
Doubtful.
No way.

1295
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,521
I'm sorry.
Me, too.

1296
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,423
Okay, look.

1297
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:47,502
You guys really
think this is funny.

1298
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:48,704
<i>Oh, yes.
Sí.
Definitely.</i>

1299
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,373
The truth hurts.
Okay.

1300
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:52,908
I'll tell you what, Peanut,
you think that's funny?

1301
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:54,376
I have something here
that you're going to like.

1302
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:55,811
What?
Just trust me.

1303
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,714
You're going to love this.

1304
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,918
What the (bleep) is that?

1305
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,124
Hi, look at me!
I'm a little idiot!

1306
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,659
(high-pitched giggles)

1307
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,061
That is not funny.
Yes, it is!

1308
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:14,563
No, it's not!
I think it is.

1309
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,997
JOSE: Me, too.
LOL.
Shut up!

1310
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,067
You guys have been awesome.
Thank you. Good night.

1311
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,205
(rock music plays)

1312
01:02:24,305 --> 01:03:24,823
