Go!

3
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,978
- Morning.
- Yes, it is.

4
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:43,380
Shit!

5
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,447
Come on!

6
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:52,821
- You got $1.25 on there?
- Is this machine working?

7
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,097
Is my machine working?

8
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:57,625
- There you go. Five quarters.
- Yes.

9
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:00,399
We've got a lot of people in a hurry
here. So whatever you can do.

10
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,608
Sir, it's what I've got.

11
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:05,694
I got you.

12
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:08,633
There you go.
Hey, the machine's working.

13
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,066
- $1.25.
- All right, have a seat.

14
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:23,436
Open the fuckin' door!

15
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:49,768
Sir, I don't even know
what you're talking...

16
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:53,637
- So you don't know what I'm talking about?
- No, sir, no. I do not.

17
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:57,306
That's interesting, because we have you
and your little slut bunny

18
00:02:57,406 --> 00:03:02,554
on camera getting all nice and cozy
with the same guy in the parking lot.

19
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:06,080
So I'm going to ask you again...

20
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,447
Who is this fuckin' guy
and where is our fuckin' money?

21
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,886
I... I don't know.

22
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,588
There's only so many ways
that I can ask you nicely.

23
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:19,056
This... this is nicely?

24
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:20,964
Fuck.

25
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:25,156
Oh, fuckin' Christ, man!
What the fuck? What the fuck?

26
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:28,031
Fuck! Fuckin'...

27
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,050
No.

28
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:32,968
- God!
- Damn it! Let go of me!

29
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:37,671
- Babe... baby, I'm so fuckin' sorry.
- Oh, my God, baby! What did they do to you?

30
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:40,307
- We don't know who he is, asshole!
- I'm sorry.

31
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:43,591
Asshole? Okay.

32
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,184
Asshole, it is.

33
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:47,992
She didn't mean that!
She didn't mean it!

34
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,948
Derrick!

35
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:53,215
Derrick. Derrick.

36
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,554
Bat's not always the answer.

37
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:07,729
Funny thing about these e-cigarettes.

38
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,457
I miss the satisfaction of burning something
down to fuckin' ashes in your hand.

39
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,378
My apologies.

40
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:22,163
Derrick can be
a little overzealous at times.

41
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:27,379
- Mr. Pope, this is just...
- I'm not finished.

42
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,649
I've been Derrick's mentor for a while
now. I taught him everything he knows...

43
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:34,868
how to run a casino floor,
how to run a business,

44
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:37,282
how to really run a business,

45
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:40,523
but most importantly,
how to spot a thief.

46
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:43,492
Because in our business,
the number 1 rule is

47
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,728
"Never let anyone steal from you,"

48
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:51,679
because if even one person steals
from you, even as little as...

49
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,398
- 10 Gs.
- ...$10,000,

50
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:58,271
it's a sign of weakness. It's a drop
of blood in shark-infested waters,

51
00:04:58,371 --> 00:04:59,805
a hole in your defense.

52
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:04,155
And when people think you're weak,
they come in droves to take what's yours.

53
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:06,607
Like flies to the proverbial shit.

54
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:10,516
Normally I'd give Derrick here all night
to make your regret stealing from me.

55
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:11,703
No, but we didn't...

56
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:15,475
But now, you've made me late for my own
surprise party. So here's what we're gonna do,

57
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:18,220
I'm going to give you both 10 seconds
to tell me where the money is

58
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,688
and whose idea it was
to take it in the first place,

59
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,657
or Derrick here kills you both...

60
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:26,193
- Oh, God!
- ...and I lose out on 10 grand,

61
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,795
which, frankly, means shit to me.
'Cause you know what?

62
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,064
This is about principle, not money.

63
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:35,000
- No, please.
- It's that simple.

64
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,536
- Ten, nine...
- We don't know who took your fuckin' money!

65
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:40,231
- ...eight, seven...
- Please!

66
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,842
- ...six, five...
- No, Mr. Pope! Mr. Pope!

67
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:46,344
- ...four, three...
- We don't know who he is! Please!

68
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:48,542
- ...three...
- Mr. Pope, we don't have your money!

69
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:52,316
- ...two, one.
- Fuckin'! Glenn Haley! Glenn fuckin' Haley!

70
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,585
He's staying at Candlewood, 451!
And it's all her fuckin' idea!

71
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:58,462
- What? What? You fuckin' bastard!
- It's all her fuckin' idea!

72
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:00,288
I can't...

73
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:01,956
- Oh, fuck!
- You see, Derrick?

74
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:04,058
- No, fuck!
- Bat's not always the answer.

75
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:07,594
When it comes down to it, when it's you
or them, as a species, it's in our DNA,

76
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:10,156
our very nature,
to choose self-preservation.

77
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:13,432
I don't care if you're Mother Teresa,
Mahatma Gandhi or fuckin' Ned Flanders.

78
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:16,268
When the chips are down, we choose life
over loved ones, every time.

79
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:17,536
- Got it.
- You know.

80
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,771
Can I... Can I go now, Mr. Pope?

81
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,638
Sure, you can go now.
Derrick, show him the door.

82
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:36,045
30 years.

83
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,923
30 years, not one vacation,
not one sick day. Now he's leaving us.

84
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,895
- We're all going to miss you, Mr. Pope.
- I'll miss you.

85
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:43,323
He's leaving us for good.

86
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:46,693
If he owes you some money, you better get it
quick, 'cause he's out of here next week.

87
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,324
A toast to the man himself.

88
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:54,499
Our hope, our savior, our Pope.

89
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,632
Our Pope!

90
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,747
Ain't much of a trick
if you can't finish it, pal.

91
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,484
Is that your card?

92
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:16,868
How'd you do that?

93
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:19,659
I can't tell you that.
That's why it's magic.

94
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,206
Slight of hand, my friend. While you're busy
watching the deck in the left hand,

95
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:25,658
the magic was happening in the right.

96
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:28,628
Not sure if I want you
handling my cards, friend.

97
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:31,907
Will you excuse me for a moment?

98
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:34,047
Dealer change.

99
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:37,668
Very nice party, Mr. Pope.
You are a very loved man.

100
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,342
Thank you, Mr. Tao.

101
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:42,286
Whoever said money can't buy love
clearly just didn't have enough.

102
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,674
This place will never be
the same without you.

103
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:48,076
I feel your absence may change
my luck at the tables.

104
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,737
You got nothing to worry about, Mr. Tao.

105
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:52,909
Mr. Prince will make sure the Swan's tables
are still the luckiest in the city.

106
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:54,915
That's all I needed to hear.

107
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:57,176
- Sorry. Good to see you.
- You need some water?

108
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,050
I'm okay. I just need
a minute in the office.

109
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,384
Mr. Pope? Mr. Pope?

110
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,842
What do you need?

111
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:08,657
- I'd like to have a word with him.
- Not tonight.

112
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:30,023
<i>You've reached Sydney.</i>

113
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:33,731
<i>Please leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</i>

114
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,351
Hey, Syd, it's me.
I was really hoping to see you tonight.

115
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:42,564
I know you're busy, but...
give me a call when you get this. Bye.

116
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:07,343
Carol.

117
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,022
- Hey.
- Hey.

118
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:24,295
Any changes?

119
00:09:25,484 --> 00:09:27,245
No.

120
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:38,206
Jesus, Luke. It's not going to cover
what we owe on last month's bill.

121
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:40,875
I'm doing the best I can, Julie.

122
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:43,493
What? What is it?

123
00:09:43,593 --> 00:09:47,180
I'm sorry, Mr. Vaughn,
but we've given you ample time.

124
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,999
There comes a time
when we have to accept reality.

125
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:54,186
So what? I'm supposed to sit by helplessly
and watch my little girl suffer?

126
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:57,962
We're talking about my little girl here.

127
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,524
You give me until the end of the week.

128
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:02,292
You understand? You give me
until the end of the week.

129
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:04,660
- I'll get you every penny by Friday.
- Mr. Vaughn.

130
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,495
- Just listen to me.
- Mr. Vaughn...

131
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:09,668
Every penny by Friday.
You keep her name on that list.

132
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:14,287
She's going to get that surgery.
I will get you every penny.

133
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:15,934
Please.

134
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:20,480
Friday, Mr. Vaughn.

135
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,596
Friday.

136
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:35,791
Hey. Talking about Princess Riley here
and her best friend Monkey.

137
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:38,658
And they were going to go into...

138
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:41,423
was it a very enchanted magical forest

139
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:44,092
or was it a very scary forest?

140
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:47,227
- Scary forest.
- Oh, my goodness. Of course it is.

141
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:51,270
Okay, so Princess Riley
and her best friend, Monkey...

142
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,165
Stop.

143
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:57,097
I don't want to be the hero tonight.

144
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,438
But you're the bravest
little girl I know.

145
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:05,006
I want you to be the hero.
I want you to save me.

146
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:14,203
Okay. I think that is a great idea.

147
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:17,472
<i>Princess Riley and Monkey,</i>

148
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:20,429
<i>they got to the very creaky bridge.</i>

149
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,025
<i>And there's an ogre that comes out
from underneath the bridge.</i>

150
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,818
- <i>What do you think the ogre's name is?</i>
- <i>Luke.</i>

151
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,606
Smoke?

152
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:48,167
- Nah, I quit.
- Health?

153
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:52,068
- Money, actually.
- This one's free.

154
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:58,758
Thank you.

155
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:01,110
Vaughn, right?

156
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:05,530
Heard you've been
working here a long time.

157
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,449
- Too long.
- Bet you've seen some crazy shit.

158
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,638
Yeah, man, I've seen some crazy shit.

159
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:15,654
Been here about three
or four months myself.

160
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,406
And I've seen some crazy shit.

161
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:21,289
Like this fat Chinese guy
who comes in every week...

162
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:24,262
biggest fucking loser, this guy.

163
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:28,066
This guy drops a buttload of money
every Thursday, just like clockwork.

164
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,079
Well...

165
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,803
you play long enough,
the house always wins.

166
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:37,905
It's the way this guy loses...

167
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,018
<i>making all the wrong bets,</i>

168
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:44,278
<i>holding when he shouldn't,
not splitting when he should.</i>

169
00:13:44,378 --> 00:13:46,416
<i>Fuckin' guy wants to lose.</i>

170
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:48,814
<i>Shitload of money, every Thursday night.</i>

171
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:51,917
<i>Nobody's got that kind
of fuckin' money to burn.</i>

172
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:53,585
<i>You know what's ever crazier?</i>

173
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:57,400
<i>Every Friday night, a different Chinese guy
comes to the high-rollers table,</i>

174
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,891
<i>plays roulette, and wins fuckin' huge.</i>

175
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,488
<i>I'm talking statistic-anomaly
fuckin' huge.</i>

176
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:07,697
<i>Every Friday night,
like fuckin' clockwork.</i>

177
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:11,000
Why don't you just cut to the chase
and tell me what's on your mind?

178
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,335
The way it appears to me,

179
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,338
is they're taking in a shitload
of money every Thursday night

180
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,778
and laundering it out
through the casino.

181
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:21,612
You're telling me this because?

182
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:26,583
Put 'em in an awful bad spot, if someone
were to rob them of that money.

183
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,319
It's not like they're going
to go crying to the police

184
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,223
about someone stealing their dirty cash.

185
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:36,376
Well, sounds like
you've got this all figured out.

186
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,592
I do, except for one piece.

187
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:44,089
I need a guy who's been here too long,

188
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:46,718
smoking habit he can't afford,

189
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,068
and access to the vault.

190
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:57,977
- Thanks for the cigarette.
- So any thoughts on the matter?

191
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,489
Yeah. Stealing from the Pope...

192
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:04,682
is suicide.

193
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,905
<i>The number you have reached
is not in service at this time</i>

194
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,373
<i>and there is no new number...</i>

195
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:36,075
Yeah?

196
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,679
Got that address you wanted.
Also a Luke Vaughn wants a meeting.

197
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,228
All right, send him in. Shit.

198
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,451
Luke Vaughn.
What can I do for you? Sit down.

199
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,620
I was wondering if we
could have a word in private.

200
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,825
Everything we say here is private.

201
00:15:58,245 --> 00:15:59,727
How are you, sir?

202
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,596
I'm still breathing, Vaughn.
Still breathing.

203
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,131
Well, that's good. I suppose
that's more than some can say.

204
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,833
Oh, indeed.
How's that pretty little wife of yours?

205
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:12,200
- Ex-wife now, actually. She's...
- Well, fuck her. I hope you traded up.

206
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,228
Listen, Mr. Pope. I...
I'm here to ask a favor, a big one.

207
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:21,577
- How big?
- $300,000 big, at least.

208
00:16:21,677 --> 00:16:23,799
What do you need $300,000
at least for, Vaughn?

209
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,167
You remember my daughter Riley.

210
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,669
She's sick, in the hospital.

211
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:30,303
- Needs an operation.
- Insurance?

212
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,058
Insurance doesn't even
cover the treatments.

213
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,995
Been paying out of pocket
for a month and I'm behind.

214
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:41,632
So far behind that if I don't come up with
money by Friday, she's gonna lose her spot.

215
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:44,418
You know I don't run
a charity here. Rule number 3.

216
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:47,337
"It's not a business
if you give the money away."

217
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:48,971
I remember the rules.

218
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:52,226
This isn't charity. It's a favor.

219
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:55,443
$300,000 that I'm never going to see
again sure sounds like charity to me.

220
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:57,634
No, sir. I will pay it back.

221
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,846
I sign your paycheck, Vaughn.
Who are you kidding?

222
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:05,771
- Mr. Pope, you're my only option.
- I don't make exceptions.

223
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,986
Let me ask you something...
what if it were you?

224
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,588
What if you were in my shoes
and your kid was sick?

225
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,223
- Hey, hey, time's up.
- What if Sydney was sick?

226
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,658
- Nobody's talking to you.
- That's all the time you get.

227
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:17,427
- No, it's not all the time I get.
- Mr. Pope already answered your question.

228
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:21,563
I don't accept his fucking answer!
God damn it, get your fuckin' hands off me.

229
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,715
I don't care what you don't accept.
Get the fuck out of here.

230
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,500
What about the shit
that I've done for you?

231
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,569
What do you want? A fuckin' cookie?
What you did for me? You didn't do shit for me.

232
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:32,046
You fuckin' ran away. I let you go away.
You wanted to start a new life, you found God.

233
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:34,107
I didn't want my little girl
growing up hating me

234
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,708
- for the man I'd become!
- Get out of here.

235
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:38,267
You've got what you want,
I got what I want. Go!

236
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,179
- Like you, God damn it! Fuck!
- Move it!

237
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:43,469
- You're a bad bet!
- Get your fuckin' hands off me.

238
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:47,715
- Hey!
- Damn it, don't touch me!

239
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:55,221
You're fuckin' fired.
Get him the fuck out of here.

240
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:05,597
- That was awkward.
- Yeah, well...

241
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:07,265
What's with that guy? What's his deal?

242
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:11,202
That guy would have been you, but he
found love or religion, some bullshit.

243
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:15,239
He just left everything.
He turned it all down.

244
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:18,942
<i>I don't know, Derrick. What do you think?
Maybe I should have just given him the money?</i>

245
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,378
<i>I don't think the younger you
would've even considered that an option.</i>

246
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:24,473
<i>"Don't let sentiment
cloud your judgment.</i>

247
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:27,148
<i>"Relationships come and go,
but principles...</i>

248
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:29,775
<i>"principles are here to stay."</i>

249
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,002
Frank Pope.

250
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:34,852
Glad someone was listening.

251
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,257
Hey, ladies. Looking good.

252
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:59,559
I'm in.

253
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:04,070
But I was just fired,
so if you want the vault codes,

254
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,982
it's pretty much going
to have to be tomorrow night.

255
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,482
Let's do it.

256
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,470
Who the fuck are these guys?

257
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:35,139
My boy Dante.

258
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,107
Mickey.

259
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:39,041
Hey, man.

260
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,477
This isn't what we agreed to.

261
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:45,436
I've known this guy since we were kids.
His favorite color is blue.

262
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:48,750
He lost his virginity to Becky McCormick.
Of course, I fucked her first.

263
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,348
Anything you want to know, just ask.

264
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:54,487
What's his dick taste like?

265
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:01,575
Relax. Dante's bringing the guns.

266
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:04,612
- Mickey's got the car.
- Who said anything about guns?

267
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,665
Feel free to leave yours
with your fuckin' mommy.

268
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:10,527
I'm not walking in there
with just my dick in my hand.

269
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,007
You do know
who we're dealing with, right?

270
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:17,938
We go in there with guns,
Pope catches us, we're dead.

271
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:24,452
It's my operation, Vaughn.
The guns stay.

272
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,282
You don't like it,
take a fuckin' walk right now.

273
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:32,319
Otherwise, nobody else here
has a problem with it.

274
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,318
So we good?

275
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,702
What's your plan?

276
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:45,567
Walk in there just after closing,
stick our shotguns in their fuckin' faces.

277
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:48,264
They'll be all tired and shit.
They're not going to do anything.

278
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:51,433
Grab the green stacks,
walk the fuck out by dawn.

279
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,512
- Keep it simple.
- Yeah.

280
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:56,075
Well, simple is usually the best,
but what you've got here

281
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:58,740
is the simplest way for us
to get our asses shot off.

282
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,207
You got a better fuckin' idea,
we'd love to hear it.

283
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:15,555
- Swan?
- Swan.

284
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:19,492
You got the vault, transformer room.
Pepper's the vault.

285
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,570
- Sugar should be the vault.
- What?

286
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,864
It's sweet. Everybody wants it.
Makes sense for the money to be the sugar.

287
00:21:28,683 --> 00:21:31,566
Fine. Sugar's the vault.

288
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:37,510
Cox, you're the ketchup.
Mickey is Sweet'N Low. I'm the salt.

289
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,878
Dante, you're the pepper.

290
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:42,827
- Why do I got to be the pepper?
- 'Cause I'm running out of fuckin' condiments.

291
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:46,279
- Dante, shut the fuck up.
- Nobody steals from the Swan.

292
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:49,681
But that's because they're afraid
of the Pope, not because it's Fort Knox.

293
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:52,384
The way I see it,
we've got three things going for us.

294
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:54,553
One, we have the access codes.
That's on me.

295
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:57,588
Two, we have the inside man. That's you.

296
00:21:57,688 --> 00:22:00,558
Three, we have knowledge
of a certain security guard

297
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:04,362
that likes his donuts and coffee
and precisely 3:25 every night.

298
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:08,332
- Every night?
- Every night. Everybody with me so far?

299
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:11,924
Mickey, you following me?

300
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:14,538
Yeah, I'm following you.

301
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:18,388
This is you with the car. Can I trust
the car won't link back to us?

302
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:23,579
You're going to pick Dante and I up
right here at this bar at 3:00 a.m.

303
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,501
- Where am I?
- You're at work.

304
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:29,018
You finish your shift,
clock out, don't leave.

305
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:31,540
Find your way to the transformer
room and wait.

306
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,009
- Until?
- 3:30.

307
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:36,711
There'll only be a few employees
hanging around by then.

308
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:39,653
You... you're going to be
parked up here.

309
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:41,551
Right by the scrambled eggs. Cool.

310
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,620
This gives you a straight direction
south on the freeway.

311
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:48,173
- Don't fuck it up.
- You said you got a straight shot,

312
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:52,176
- not we got a straight shot.
- There is no "we."

313
00:22:52,276 --> 00:22:55,079
We make it out of the Swan alive,

314
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:58,215
I'm on my own.
You have a problem with that?

315
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:01,683
As long as we got our money,
I don't give a rat's ass where you go.

316
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,990
Let me know if you need
a quick tutorial.

317
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:15,151
Where'd you learn to do that?

318
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:18,232
Fort Beginning for Boys.

319
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:22,054
- Army?
- Yeah. I served.

320
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:24,671
The only thing I served
is fries, my friend.

321
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,937
I'd never have guessed.

322
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:44,284
<i>Dante and I will lock-bump our way
onto the Swan's main floor.</i>

323
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:48,692
<i>The main casino floor's empty at the time
of night. Everyone goes below to close out.</i>

324
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,894
Go, go, go.

325
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:54,063
<i>As long as I've known him, good old
Jerry likes to take a leisurely stroll</i>

326
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:59,100
<i>to the break room for a stale donut
and coffee right at 3:25.</i>

327
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,770
<i>All the inner doors are maglocked
with a three-point security seal.</i>

328
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,818
<i>The vault itself is on a secure circuit.</i>

329
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:08,670
<i>The rest of the system
is hooked into the ship's old wiring.</i>

330
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,959
<i>So wait for me and Dante
to get into position.</i>

331
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:14,727
At exactly 3:30 a.m.,
you kill the power.

332
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:22,753
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

333
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:25,522
<i>From the time the lights go out,
we have 10 minutes to get in and out</i>

334
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:29,358
before back-up generators come on
and lock down the ship.

335
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,693
Come on, let's go. Move.

336
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:34,304
Let's go, let's go.
Quick, come on. Let's go.

337
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:37,062
This way. Let's hope
this fucking code works.

338
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:44,100
All right, you motherfucker, unlock.

339
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,575
- What?
- Can you come back later, please?

340
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,860
Thank you.

341
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:56,209
Let's go!

342
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:57,764
Move.

343
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:01,451
Green bags only, dirty stuff.

344
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:05,791
Let's go, in the bags. Hurry.

345
00:25:10,188 --> 00:25:12,056
No, we're good.

346
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:25,777
Come on.

347
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:27,845
- Let's do this.
- Come on.

348
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:31,079
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, guys, come on.

349
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:35,395
Come on, come on, come on.

350
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:41,189
- Fuckin' A!
- Let's go! Quit fuckin' around.

351
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,771
- Let's go, come on. Get the bags.
- That's right.

352
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:46,494
- That's nice, get out.
- Let's get out.

353
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:48,993
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go.

354
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:56,701
Shit.

355
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:06,178
If something goes bad, what's plan B?

356
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:08,730
Plan B is run for your fucking life.

357
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,924
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

358
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,938
Shit, shit.

359
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:24,560
Motherfuckers!

360
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:35,180
Ready? Go!

361
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:47,682
Dante!

362
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:49,758
I got you, man.

363
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,616
I'm getting the fuck out of here.
Come on! Get out of here, Mickey.

364
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:55,416
Come on, get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.

365
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:02,106
Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.

366
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:11,999
What the fuck? Un-fuckin' believable!

367
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,767
- This way, follow me.
- Asshole!

368
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,705
This way! Fuck! Come on.

369
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:18,599
Let's go, buddy. Come on.

370
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,539
- Fuck!
- Come on, man! Let's get out of here!

371
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:25,606
- This way!
- Go, go, go, go! Here!

372
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,977
- Morning.
- Yes, it is.

373
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:45,791
- Ma?
- <i>Hi, honey.</i>

374
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:49,294
- Mom, what are you doing awake?
- <i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

375
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:52,597
- Your medication isn't working?
- <i>I haven't taken it yet.</i>

376
00:27:52,697 --> 00:27:55,199
<i>I was thinking of taking
the dog out for a walk.</i>

377
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,967
It's 4:00 a.m., Ma.

378
00:27:57,067 --> 00:28:00,100
- <i>I worry about you.</i>
- I'll be fine.

379
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:04,239
God damn it, run.

380
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,744
Come on!

381
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:12,480
All right, I love you.

382
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,048
Good night.

383
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:16,650
Come on.

384
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:18,985
Go.

385
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:21,251
Please, please.

386
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:28,324
Open the fuckin' door!
Open the fuckin' door!

387
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:31,295
Let's go!

388
00:28:42,969 --> 00:28:45,231
Close the door and drive.

389
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:49,408
Let's go!

390
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,259
Everybody be cool.
We'll be out of here in a second.

391
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:57,011
Cops!

392
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:05,736
Take your mask off. We gotta blend in.

393
00:29:10,274 --> 00:29:11,799
Fuck.

394
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:14,545
Everybody act normal, nobody gets hurt.

395
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:18,800
This is Officer Bauhaus.
Multiple shots fired. I'm in pursuit.

396
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,828
Fuck.

397
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:59,027
- She wants me to pull over!
- Keep driving.

398
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:03,640
Fuck this!

399
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:16,085
Shots fired. In pursuit
of at least one armed suspect.

400
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:19,102
Don't ever put
your fucking hands on me again.

401
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:21,456
Pretty sure shooting a cop
is not very good for our situation.

402
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:23,397
I'm in charge!

403
00:30:23,497 --> 00:30:28,428
- <i>Please describe the bus, over.</i>
- Bus number 657. I repeat, 657.

404
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,496
- I'm in charge.
- Noted.

405
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:39,771
I'm gonna make this
real fucking simple for you.

406
00:30:40,628 --> 00:30:43,675
Lose that cop,
or lose your goddamn life.

407
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,110
Whatever you say. We're cool.

408
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,813
<i>Calling all units,
possible hostage situation.</i>

409
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:52,982
<i>Commuter bus... bus number 657.</i>

410
00:30:53,082 --> 00:30:55,918
<i>I repeat, bus 657.</i>

411
00:30:56,518 --> 00:30:59,001
- Head I-10 west.
- Cox, what are you doing?

412
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:03,254
Improvising. Head I-10 west!
Go that way!

413
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:11,497
Suspect appears to be headed
towards Interstate 10 onramp, over.

414
00:31:11,597 --> 00:31:13,705
You can't let them get on the highway.

415
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,699
All units, we have suspects
headed towards the Russell onramp.

416
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,136
<i>Set up stingers just west of Waterloo,
right before the onramp.</i>

417
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:40,323
So what do you suppose
they're up to now?

418
00:31:40,423 --> 00:31:42,939
- Setting up a roadblock.
- How the fuck do you know?

419
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,294
Stop your vehicle.
We're setting up a roadblock.

420
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:48,366
There's nowhere for you to go.

421
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,896
I need a phone. Who's got a phone?

422
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:54,331
Who's got a lipstick?

423
00:31:59,736 --> 00:32:01,171
Thank you.

424
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:03,039
- What's your name?
- Rebecca.

425
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:05,241
All right, Rebecca.
What's your phone number?

426
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,766
- Get me the fuckin' cops on this thing.
- ...0-1...

427
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:10,978
- Get me the fuckin' cops on that thing!
- All right, all right, all right!

428
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:14,081
Dispatch, this is 657.
Put me through to PD.

429
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:18,952
- <i>Please stand by, bus 657.</i>
- I can't stand by! Patch me through to PD!

430
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:22,788
- <i>Do you need assistance?</i>
- The fuckin' cops! Quit fucking around!

431
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:26,225
- I can't wait!
- Hey. I'm gonna need you to back off.

432
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:28,447
- You know I can't do that.
- Why?

433
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:31,618
'cause I'm the cop, and you're the robber.
That's the game. It's pretty black and white.

434
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:33,794
- No gray area?
- No.

435
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:36,489
Come on. There's always
a gray area, Officer...

436
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:39,426
- Bauhaus.
- All right, you got a first name?

437
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,158
Cops, now!

438
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:43,794
- Patch me through to the police.
- Quit fuckin' around!

439
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:46,419
Kris, I need you to clear the roadblock.

440
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,005
- I need you to pull over.
- Tell them to clear the roadblock!

441
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:52,184
- Just give me a second. I'm working on it.
- Clear the goddamn roadblock!

442
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:55,652
Listen to me.
I'm going to need you to trust me.

443
00:32:56,345 --> 00:33:00,407
Kris, I can't help these people on the bus
if you don't give me this one.

444
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:05,077
Stay right there. Keep your eyes on us.
But I need you to clear that roadblock.

445
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:08,418
- We gotta get on the Interstate.
- Tell them to clear the roadblock.

446
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:10,815
- They gotta clear the roadblock!
- You do this for me,

447
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:13,639
and I promise you, I give you
my word, no one gets hurt.

448
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:15,617
Tell them that people
are going to start dying.

449
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:22,659
Captain Michaels,
I need you to remove all roadblocks.

450
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:25,161
I repeat...
removal of all roadblocks, over.

451
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:27,329
Negative, Bauhaus,
I'm not letting them on the Interstate.

452
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:30,798
- But, sir, I have one of...
- <i>The roadblock stays, Bauhaus.</i>

453
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,112
- It's out of my control.
- Kris,

454
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:37,337
I've got at least 10 people on this bus,
including a little boy and a pregnant girl.

455
00:33:37,437 --> 00:33:39,749
- Tell them to clear the fuckin' roadblock!
- This lunatic?

456
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:43,641
- I can't control him if this bus stops.
- Tell 'em to clear the roadblock!

457
00:33:44,242 --> 00:33:46,765
You'd better keep your fucking word.

458
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:58,419
Look out, look out!

459
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,661
Go there!

460
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:15,936
<i>Kris, are you there? You okay?</i>

461
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:18,169
Eat a dick.

462
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:43,359
- You ever try a real cigarette?
- I only smoke vapor, baby.

463
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:46,764
Used to just roll tobacco in paper,

464
00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:51,034
then enter the filter,
now this vapor bullshit.

465
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:58,707
If and when you ever have kids, they won't
even know what a real cigarette is.

466
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,159
They'll just think it's something
from old movies.

467
00:35:01,259 --> 00:35:03,394
What are you saying, baby?

468
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:06,475
Everything dies.

469
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:08,615
From the moment
something's born or invented,

470
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:11,684
we're on a one-way course
with obsolescence.

471
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:14,055
Obso-what?

472
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,553
Yeah?

473
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:22,412
- Sorry to call you so early.
- <i>No one calls with good news at 5:00 a.m.</i>

474
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:25,926
Derrick, there's no right way
to break bad news. So how bad is it?

475
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:36,870
- How much?
- Three mil.

476
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,373
I'm sorry. Maybe I just had
a stroke on my way over here,

477
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:43,349
'cause I thought
I just heard you say $3 million.

478
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:46,643
- Yeah.
- Tell me it wasn't the house cash.

479
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:51,915
- Who?
- Vaughn, two others.

480
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:53,617
- You sure?
- Positive.

481
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:58,794
- Where are they?
- They're on a bus.

482
00:35:58,894 --> 00:36:00,903
Let's recap.

483
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:04,046
A man we fired yesterday
stole $3 million,

484
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:08,129
that, if recovered by the police, implicates
us in connection to money laundering

485
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:12,747
for some of the city's most well-known
criminal families. And...

486
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:16,369
- you let them get on a bus?
- No, I didn't let them. They hijacked it.

487
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:18,504
The cops got involved.
Then I had to pull back.

488
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:22,240
- So what are you going to do about it?
- I'm gonna find 'em.

489
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,366
The money will be back
in this vault by tonight.

490
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:28,185
Good, Derrick.

491
00:36:29,093 --> 00:36:31,344
I believe you.

492
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:39,784
Now I want to speak with Vaughn
before we finish this.

493
00:36:41,837 --> 00:36:45,153
<i>All right, we are following
this situation of a runaway bus.</i>

494
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:49,671
<i>Suspected hijackers are on this bus
and there is a very heavy police presence</i>

495
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:52,596
<i>following the bus down the highway.</i>

496
00:37:06,116 --> 00:37:08,094
Sorry, kiddo.

497
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:27,071
<i>Bus 657, please respond.</i>

498
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:31,766
- <i>Bus 657, bus 657? Come in, please.</i>
- Turn that goddamn thing down.

499
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:44,312
Are you fucking kidding me?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

500
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:46,480
Give me your goddamn phone.
Did you take my picture, bitch?

501
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,183
- No, I swear.
- Everybody give me your goddamn phones.

502
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:51,769
Give me your fuckin' phones.
Give me your fuckin' phone.

503
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,106
Give me your goddamn phone.
Put your fuckin' phone in the bag.

504
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,491
No, no, no, me no speak "Engrish."

505
00:37:57,591 --> 00:37:59,794
Oh, no? You speak English now?

506
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:03,031
Okay, fine, sorry.
Just my whole life is on there, man.

507
00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:04,666
- Give me your phone.
- I'm looking.

508
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:07,868
- Give me your goddamn phone.
- I'm looking, I'm sorry! I don't know where...

509
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:15,867
I got it, I got it.

510
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:27,985
Go ahead, go to him.

511
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:32,099
- Oh, what the fuck?
- The kid's scared, all right?

512
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:34,895
I don't give a shit.
Don't move anybody else.

513
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:38,788
Jesus Christ. You're a real pleasure
to be around, you know that?

514
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:42,282
All right, everybody,
just stay calm, all right?

515
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:44,327
I know this isn't
how you want to start your day.

516
00:38:44,427 --> 00:38:47,716
You work with us here, I promise you,
you're going to get off this bus safely.

517
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:01,680
- How do you feel?
- I'm pretty cold, <i>paisan.</i>

518
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,655
Put some goddamn pressure on it.

519
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:09,322
All right, listen up!
Anybody here a doctor?

520
00:39:09,422 --> 00:39:14,194
Nurse? EMT? Anybody got any kind
of medical knowledge whatsoever?

521
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:17,098
I'm a veterinarian student.

522
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:19,517
- Yeah, bring her up.
- Bring her up? What the fuck?

523
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:22,268
"Engrish," get your ass
up here and help her.

524
00:39:25,138 --> 00:39:28,310
Okay, okay. I...

525
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:34,549
Honey, I know this is really scary.
We're going to get off this bus.

526
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:37,020
They're not going to hurt us.

527
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,624
Is that a rabbit? Does he have a name?

528
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:44,694
- Big Ear.
- Big Ear?

529
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:49,966
He used to be Big Ears,
but my sister ripped it.

530
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:56,124
Well, I think he still looks adorable,
one ear or not.

531
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:58,660
What's your name, sweetheart?

532
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,859
- Joseph.
- Joseph?

533
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:03,979
Honey, why are you
all alone on this bus?

534
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:19,667
- Just keep breathing.
- I can unfuck this.

535
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:23,772
I know this guy in Texas.
Runs one of those small dirt airfields.

536
00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:27,242
It's right on the border. It's perfect.
We get there, we jump on a plane.

537
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:31,810
He can take us wherever the fuck we want
to go. South America, Central America.

538
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,783
- Hey.
- What are you doing, man?

539
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:40,272
- You're going to get us all killed.
- There's three of them and 10 of us.

540
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:42,193
If we charge them,
they don't stand a chance.

541
00:40:42,293 --> 00:40:45,894
- They've got guns. I'm in a beaver suit.
- So?

542
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:48,663
- Mexico?
- I didn't say Mexico.

543
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:52,686
Just on the border. Jump on a plane,
go wherever. It's a plan.

544
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:56,075
- Why don't we just fucking drive into Mexico?
- We're not going to Mexico.

545
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:58,578
I'm going to get us out of this shit.

546
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,559
Cox's Sucker!

547
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,509
Jono?

548
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:15,423
- Sorry we put you in this situation.
- Me too.

549
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:23,434
- Remember that time you fucked my sister?
- <i>No!</i>

550
00:41:23,534 --> 00:41:26,607
Yeah, that's 'cause it never happened.
If you want it to happen,

551
00:41:26,707 --> 00:41:28,004
you'll do me a favor.

552
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:35,486
- Is he okay?
- He ran away from home.

553
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:40,319
His sister picks on him and his parents
take her side every time, apparently.

554
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,521
I hear that.

555
00:41:45,244 --> 00:41:47,259
Move slow, a-hole.

556
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:50,800
This is not going to end well for you.

557
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,749
Go ahead. Take the shot.

558
00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:55,974
No, I'm not fucking kidding you.
Big-ass bags of money.

559
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:59,153
Be the hero, man. What if you miss?

560
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:01,723
Cox is going to turn around,
he's going to shoot immediately.

561
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:05,741
Maybe he misses, maybe he doesn't.
What if he hits...

562
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:07,517
- What's your name?
- Pauline.

563
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:09,873
She for sure is going
to be collateral damage.

564
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:14,288
And the mascot guy? He's dead.
You're not going to do this.

565
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:20,499
Be seeing you soon. Three hours out.

566
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,399
- What's your name?
- Eric.

567
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,444
Eric?

568
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:26,734
Sit in your fuckin' seat.

569
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,410
We're on our way.

570
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:36,215
- What's going on?
- We need to head to Galveston, Texas.

571
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:39,016
Galveston? I'll take you
wherever you want, chief.

572
00:42:39,116 --> 00:42:42,353
But we're not even going
to make Slidell on these fumes.

573
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:48,396
- Cops, this is robbers.
- What the fuck are you doing?

574
00:42:48,796 --> 00:42:51,031
We're out of fuel.

575
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:56,334
We're ready to make a deal.

576
00:42:59,572 --> 00:43:01,690
Hang tight, man.

577
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,037
You disobeyed a direct order,

578
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:08,283
endangered not only your life
and the life of your fellow officers,

579
00:43:08,383 --> 00:43:10,886
but dozens of citizens' lives as well.

580
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:13,421
Anyone dies on that bus and it's on you.

581
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:15,357
- Hand over your badge and gun.
- But, sir...

582
00:43:15,457 --> 00:43:18,694
I think we're a long fucking way
from "but, sir," Bauhaus.

583
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:23,014
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
But which of you decided to...

584
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:28,435
endanger a bus full of civilian hostages
with an unauthorized roadblock?

585
00:43:31,206 --> 00:43:32,943
- You must be he.
- Who the fuck are you?

586
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:36,113
Detective Marconi, lead investigator
on this little shit show.

587
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,481
I was sent here
by Deputy Chief Braddock,

588
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:41,585
and chief outranks captain,

589
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:46,160
so... I officially release you
of your duties and responsibilities

590
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,927
and I officially reinstate you,
Officer Bauhaus.

591
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,622
- Grab your shit, come with me.
- But, detective...

592
00:43:51,722 --> 00:43:55,163
I think we're a long fucking way
from "but, detective," Captain.

593
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:58,536
That took balls doing what you did.
Why'd you do it?

594
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,238
There's a little kid on that bus, sir.

595
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:03,441
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but there's still a little kid on that bus.

596
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:07,711
When I spoke to one of the kidnappers,
there was something protective in his voice.

597
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,616
It was almost like he was thinking
straight, like a cop or a soldier.

598
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:12,809
Or a sociopath.

599
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:15,418
- I don't think so, detective.
- You don't think so?

600
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:17,545
- Call it a gut feeling.
- How many are we dealing with?

601
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:19,947
At least two, the psycho
and the soldier. Possibly more.

602
00:44:20,047 --> 00:44:23,262
- Great.
- Sir, why did you reinstate me?

603
00:44:23,362 --> 00:44:26,498
I didn't. The hijackers did,
requested you personally.

604
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:30,035
- Can you drive a fuel truck, Bauhaus?
- Does it have wheels?

605
00:44:52,194 --> 00:44:54,265
You're a real fuckin' moron,
you know that?

606
00:44:56,065 --> 00:44:59,237
Driving the same car to your job
as you drove to a crack house?

607
00:44:59,337 --> 00:45:03,572
- I don't want...
- Shut up. You made it easy for me.

608
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,411
Where they headed?
Did they have an escape plan?

609
00:45:07,811 --> 00:45:10,081
- Some friends? I'm talking to you.
- It's not my...

610
00:45:10,181 --> 00:45:12,437
I'm talking to you.

611
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:16,221
What you got here? Let me see
what you got. Oh, look at that.

612
00:45:17,121 --> 00:45:18,155
Let me see.

613
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:20,491
Man, what the fuck...

614
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:22,571
I'll do...

615
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:27,465
I don't fuckin' know. I don't know!
I don't fucking know.

616
00:45:27,865 --> 00:45:30,434
- Okay?
- Go ahead.

617
00:45:30,534 --> 00:45:32,504
- Okay.
- Shut up.

618
00:45:34,124 --> 00:45:35,867
- What?
- He doesn't know anything.

619
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,908
What was that?

620
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:41,546
- Cox, Cox, Cox, Cox!
- Jason Cox?

621
00:45:41,646 --> 00:45:44,918
- Cox said he's going to kill you?
- Cox is going to come.

622
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:48,151
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- Cox said he's gonna kill him?

623
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:53,493
Relax, relax, relax. Hey, hey.

624
00:45:53,993 --> 00:45:56,163
Relax. Shut up.

625
00:45:58,702 --> 00:46:02,561
- Please don't kill me.
- Get on your knees, get on your knees.

626
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:05,971
Please. I'll do anything. Please...

627
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:13,883
All right, boys. That bus is going
to stop on that fuckin' bridge.

628
00:46:13,983 --> 00:46:17,620
- So what are our options?
- We could hit 'em hard with tear gas.

629
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,890
I'm not ready to gas civilians
on live television, but thanks for playing.

630
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,889
- Full-on assault.
- Civilian casualties?

631
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,833
Inevitable in that scenario,
but manageable.

632
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:29,353
- Snipers?
- We're going to need two clean shots,

633
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,458
lined up from the air.
But it's going to be risky.

634
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:34,238
All right, start mapping out
the assault just in case.

635
00:46:34,338 --> 00:46:38,042
In the meantime, get our best guys in that
chopper. They get a clean shot, we take it.

636
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:40,079
- Roger that.
- You heard him. Let's move.

637
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:44,183
All right, Bauhaus! You good?
You're working the hell out of that vest.

638
00:46:44,283 --> 00:46:47,253
Stay alert, stay alive...

639
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:49,155
make note of anything useful.

640
00:46:49,255 --> 00:46:52,527
And if you can,
get us a clean visual on the gunman.

641
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:55,059
Copy that.

642
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:09,594
No. Hell no. Give 'em old man death
and that green-haired hooker back there.

643
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:12,648
Look, we give 'em the kid
and that woman,

644
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:16,013
they think we're reasonable, they see it
as a victory, it buys us more time.

645
00:47:16,113 --> 00:47:18,555
No. If we keep
the pregnant chick and the kid,

646
00:47:18,655 --> 00:47:20,971
it gives us more leverage
if shit goes bad.

647
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,326
We have one medical emergency
onboard already.

648
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:26,980
If that chick goes into labor,
they storm the bus, hostages be damned.

649
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,200
All they're going to give a crap about is
saving that baby in time for the 6:00 news.

650
00:47:33,837 --> 00:47:35,504
We're at the bridge!

651
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:48,221
Talk to me, Forbes.
You got your boys in position?

652
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:52,225
<i>We have eyes on the prize, sir.
Bus is heading into position.</i>

653
00:47:53,325 --> 00:47:56,460
- <i>This is all you, Bauhaus.</i>
- Copy that.

654
00:48:03,602 --> 00:48:07,073
<i>Bus has stopped. Bus has stopped.</i>

655
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:26,464
<i>Three people leaving the bus.
One suspect, one woman and a kid.</i>

656
00:48:27,164 --> 00:48:28,900
You got a clear shot?

657
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,008
<i>Negative, too many bogeys,
too many bogeys. Come back around.</i>

658
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:49,340
<i>Suspect one by the fuel tank.
That's too risky. May ignite.</i>

659
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,875
So what's the big plan?

660
00:48:52,026 --> 00:48:54,541
I don't know that I have one.

661
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:57,466
Maybe start a bus company
and go head-to-head with Greyhound.

662
00:48:57,566 --> 00:49:00,536
Or you could turn yourself in and let
the rest of the people off the bus.

663
00:49:00,836 --> 00:49:04,273
I can't do that yet, Kris.
Hopefully soon.

664
00:49:04,373 --> 00:49:07,510
What about their families?
What about your family?

665
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:11,298
There's got to be someone
out there that cares about you.

666
00:49:11,398 --> 00:49:13,784
I could find them, bring them here.

667
00:49:14,782 --> 00:49:17,153
I just need your name.

668
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:20,723
Good try, officer.

669
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:25,664
All right. Well... well, at least
let me check out the hostages.

670
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:28,781
You keep putting the gas in the tank,
you can do whatever you want.

671
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:32,336
<i>They're heading into the bus, sir.
No visual on the second gunman.</i>

672
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,648
What the fuck are you thinking,
bringing a cop on the bus?

673
00:49:38,748 --> 00:49:42,524
Relax. She just wants to make sure everybody's
all right, we haven't hurt anybody.

674
00:49:42,724 --> 00:49:44,310
- One of yours?
- Yeah.

675
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:47,026
He needs medical attention.
Let me take him out of here.

676
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:51,122
You're not taking him anywhere.
You're going to get your ass off the bus.

677
00:49:57,028 --> 00:50:01,035
I always thought there was nothing sexier
than a woman who fought back.

678
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:03,944
Make one more fuckin' move.

679
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:05,738
D...

680
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:08,460
if this bitch shoots me,

681
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,877
kill her and everybody else
on this fucking bus.

682
00:50:12,497 --> 00:50:14,998
- You got it, pal.
- All right, Kris.

683
00:50:15,671 --> 00:50:18,220
Tell your boss that everybody's okay.

684
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,819
Fucking bitch.

685
00:50:22,768 --> 00:50:26,893
<i>Sir, suspect one and Officer Bauhaus
have exited the bus.</i>

686
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,341
<i>You got eyes on the other perp?</i>

687
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:42,344
<i>Negative, sir. But we have
a clean shot at suspect one.</i>

688
00:50:42,594 --> 00:50:45,030
I don't know why you're doing this,
but let me help you.

689
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,685
- Let me help you with your problems.
- You have no idea what my problems are.

690
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:52,722
Come on! Let's get the fuck out of here!

691
00:50:53,522 --> 00:50:58,133
If you get a minute and have a chance,
will you let me know how the girl is?

692
00:50:59,563 --> 00:51:03,719
<i>Sir, should we take a shot?
It's now or never, sir. I have him.</i>

693
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:06,035
<i>Abort. Abort, let him go.</i>

694
00:51:19,317 --> 00:51:21,655
Go for Marconi. This is Officer Bauhaus.

695
00:51:21,755 --> 00:51:25,087
<i>Well done, Bauhaus.
What have you got for me?</i>

696
00:51:27,238 --> 00:51:28,828
<i>...proceeding toward Texas.</i>

697
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:37,519
Here you are. There you go. Enjoy.

698
00:51:38,191 --> 00:51:40,093
Can I help...

699
00:51:41,404 --> 00:51:43,613
You're a hard girl to find, Syd.

700
00:51:43,713 --> 00:51:47,050
- What are you doing here, Dad?
- What? A father can't look for his daughter?

701
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:51,052
And then find her in some grimy shelter?

702
00:51:52,355 --> 00:51:55,794
- Missed you at the party.
- I was busy.

703
00:51:56,094 --> 00:51:58,963
- You know I'm leaving town?
- Good for you.

704
00:51:59,064 --> 00:52:02,735
- I'm not sure how long.
- Need me to water your plants, feed the cat?

705
00:52:02,835 --> 00:52:05,601
I was hoping to give you something.

706
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,166
This says you own 51% of the Swan.

707
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,353
Derrick will run the whole thing.
You won't have to lift a finger.

708
00:52:19,193 --> 00:52:22,023
The money will just be in a trust,
with you as the sole beneficiary.

709
00:52:22,123 --> 00:52:25,394
You can't buy me.

710
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:28,874
- I don't want your money.
- Sydney...

711
00:52:28,974 --> 00:52:32,111
Dad, I know how this money is made.

712
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:34,905
Oh, come on, don't be so naive.
Nothing's that black and white.

713
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:37,780
- This money's as clean as the rest.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

714
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,976
This empire you've carved out
for yourself...

715
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:43,963
- For you.
- For yourself, it has a price.

716
00:52:44,063 --> 00:52:49,169
- It cost you your wife and it cost you me.
- Sydney, please, just sign the paperwork.

717
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:52,335
- I just want you to have it.
- Why the urgency? Why now?

718
00:52:57,792 --> 00:52:59,427
What?

719
00:53:02,048 --> 00:53:06,958
- What's the trick?
- There's no trick. It's in my...

720
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,291
Are you dying?

721
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:19,200
It's in my lungs, my blood, my bones.

722
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,835
Nothing they can do, so...

723
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:28,441
And you're leaving, and you think
this might be the last time you see me.

724
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:33,216
You always were a smart one, Syd.

725
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,392
Then you should hear this
before you walk out that door.

726
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:49,615
You want to give me your empire,
your beloved Swan?

727
00:53:50,398 --> 00:53:54,536
That place, that boat,
that's been a cancer for me

728
00:53:54,636 --> 00:53:59,111
and for Mom and for everything
good inside of you.

729
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:02,512
That's what you're going to be
leaving behind in this world.

730
00:54:02,612 --> 00:54:08,350
That's your legacy. If you love me,
if you ever really loved me,

731
00:54:09,021 --> 00:54:12,456
you would take it and you would
burn it all to the ground.

732
00:54:12,556 --> 00:54:15,358
You're not making any sense, Syd.

733
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:19,764
- This is real...
- Love is built on sacrifice,

734
00:54:20,464 --> 00:54:22,233
not dollars.

735
00:54:23,434 --> 00:54:25,868
What can I do to fix it?

736
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:47,330
Oh, my God! Joseph! Joseph!

737
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:52,870
So, are there any names you can remember?
Any details at all?

738
00:54:53,702 --> 00:54:58,644
Yeah, they kept calling the one guy,
the... crazy one, Cox.

739
00:54:58,744 --> 00:55:02,148
Cox? Did they mention
anything about a destination?

740
00:55:02,248 --> 00:55:06,919
- Maybe why they hijacked the bus?
- I think they were being chased.

741
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:09,489
- Chased by who?
- I don't know.

742
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,657
Did you see anyone chasing them?

743
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:15,428
I didn't, but they were
running and sweaty,

744
00:55:15,528 --> 00:55:19,166
and they kept looking out the window.
So, I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

745
00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:21,205
How's that?

746
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:24,740
- That's perfect. What do you think?
- It's pretty... it's pretty close.

747
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,280
- I'll go run a search.
- Thanks, Dan.

748
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,513
Listen, is this going to take much longer?
There's just somewhere I really need to be.

749
00:55:32,613 --> 00:55:35,083
All right. Well, yeah, we're done here.

750
00:55:35,183 --> 00:55:38,487
We'll be in contact if we need
anything else. So thank you for your time.

751
00:55:38,587 --> 00:55:42,635
- Of course. Anything I can do to help.
- Okay, bye.

752
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,490
Hello there, soldier boy.

753
00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:07,522
Is that your kid?

754
00:56:07,622 --> 00:56:11,826
Yup. Two tours, Iraq, one Afghanistan.

755
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:14,963
He's a company commander now,
stationed in Italy.

756
00:56:15,063 --> 00:56:16,765
That's a good assignment.

757
00:56:16,865 --> 00:56:18,900
You serve?

758
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,737
I did, a long time ago.

759
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,104
I thought they trained you guys
to be heroes.

760
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:31,029
Well, I seem to letting everyone down
in that department lately.

761
00:56:32,582 --> 00:56:36,586
Everything's going to be okay.
I need you to keep breathing, okay?

762
00:56:37,986 --> 00:56:41,189
- What's your name?
- Rebecca.

763
00:56:42,558 --> 00:56:44,526
Thank you.

764
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:49,821
- If I die...
- You're not going to die.

765
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:51,850
I just...

766
00:56:53,562 --> 00:56:55,670
I'm sorry.

767
00:56:58,608 --> 00:57:03,185
I'm gonna be right back.
Tom, apply pressure here.

768
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,521
So... where's my apology?

769
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,958
You got tits?

770
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:15,126
- No.
- Then go fuck yourself.

771
00:57:17,328 --> 00:57:21,381
My name is Jason Cox. My bill was
slightly higher than usual this month.

772
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:24,503
I believe my son has been using
my cell phone to call his girlfriend,

773
00:57:24,603 --> 00:57:26,406
who unfortunately moved to Texas.

774
00:57:26,506 --> 00:57:30,113
Have there been any outgoing calls
to Texas within the past week or so?

775
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:33,158
<i>I'll just need the last four
of your social in order to proceed.</i>

776
00:57:33,258 --> 00:57:36,683
Sure, no problem. One-one-two-zero.

777
00:57:36,783 --> 00:57:41,386
<i>Yes, sir. Several calls to Galveston,
Texas. 405-5...</i>

778
00:57:58,837 --> 00:58:00,506
Yeah. Tell me something good.

779
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:04,476
Looks like they're headed to Texas,
making a run for the border or some shit.

780
00:58:04,576 --> 00:58:05,562
ClichÃ©.

781
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:08,014
I'm gonna send one of our guys
out to pick up Vaughn's daughter.

782
00:58:08,114 --> 00:58:10,517
- That way we can do an exchange.
- No, no, no, no.

783
00:58:10,617 --> 00:58:13,988
- What, no exchange?
- No daughter, Derrick. No daughter.

784
00:58:15,127 --> 00:58:17,292
Mr. Pope, I think this is
just our best chance to...

785
00:58:17,392 --> 00:58:20,689
Let me make this clear, we are not going
to kidnap a bedridden little girl

786
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,128
with fucking cancer. You're not going
to touch a hair of her head.

787
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:25,568
If there's any fucking hair left
on that poor little girl's head.

788
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,804
<i>You're gonna leave her alone,
you're gonna leave her mom alone.</i>

789
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,841
And if she has a fucking teddy bear, you're
going to leave the teddy bear alone as well.

790
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:34,744
Our problem's with Vaughn, not them.
Is that understood?

791
00:58:35,504 --> 00:58:37,180
Is that understood?

792
00:58:38,335 --> 00:58:42,251
- Understood.
- Now get me my money back.

793
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:51,755
Galveston Air Cargo, Jono speaking.

794
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:08,948
<i>Anyone there?
Hey, cocksuckers, someone pick up.</i>

795
00:59:09,048 --> 00:59:11,982
<i>Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up.</i>

796
00:59:13,252 --> 00:59:14,300
Detective?

797
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,192
So how about it? A little
<i>mano-y-mano</i> meet and greet?

798
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:19,226
What makes you think we want to do that?

799
00:59:19,326 --> 00:59:21,569
<i>I hear your</i> compadre
<i>isn't doing too good.</i>

800
00:59:21,669 --> 00:59:25,700
Word on the street is he's having
a serious allergic reaction to bullets.

801
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,002
<i>Come on, let me get him some medical
supplies. At least give him a chance.</i>

802
00:59:34,206 --> 00:59:36,508
Get back to you in a minute.

803
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,919
- How's he doing?
- He's fucking dying.

804
00:59:45,068 --> 00:59:51,255
He needs blood. If not blood, he needs
fluids, IV, something, or he's gonna die.

805
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:54,532
- He needs a hospital, man.
- Not going to the fucking hospital.

806
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:58,570
- You want him to die?
- What the fuck you just ask me?

807
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,892
You listen to me, motherfucker,

808
01:00:01,092 --> 01:00:03,911
that guy, dying,

809
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:07,480
we grew up together. He's the only
fucking friend I've ever had.

810
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,851
So don't fucking ask me
if I want him to die!

811
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:14,455
I don't want to die, man.
I don't want to die.

812
01:00:14,555 --> 01:00:16,823
If we get you the shit you need,
can you keep him alive?

813
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:20,961
Hey, fucking IV shit? We get it,
can you keep him alive? Yes or no?

814
01:00:21,061 --> 01:00:24,462
Definitely for longer,
but I don't know how long.

815
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,174
You there?

816
01:00:32,274 --> 01:00:34,142
<i>Yeah.</i>

817
01:00:34,842 --> 01:00:37,779
All right, we need to get IVs,

818
01:00:37,879 --> 01:00:41,449
pain meds, bandages, clotting agents.
Can you do that?

819
01:00:41,549 --> 01:00:45,987
I can get all that for you.
I just need to deliver it in person.

820
01:00:47,087 --> 01:00:49,357
Of course you do.

821
01:00:49,457 --> 01:00:52,461
Here's the catch...
we're not stopping the bus.

822
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:53,995
I can work with that.

823
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:58,535
<i>Go for Marconi.</i>

824
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:01,640
- Detective Marconi, this is Officer Bauhaus.
- What you got?

825
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,683
I've got an ID on one of the hijackers,
a Luke Vaughn.

826
01:01:05,783 --> 01:01:08,306
Looks like he did some time
in Bibb's Correctional

827
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:10,831
- <i>and served in the army.</i>
- You get an address?

828
01:01:10,931 --> 01:01:14,870
I'm actually standing out front right now.
Looks like he was evicted.

829
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:18,256
- Neighbors say he moved in with his sister.
- Any ID on the sister?

830
01:01:18,356 --> 01:01:20,992
No, no one...
no one knows anything about her.

831
01:01:21,092 --> 01:01:23,298
Well, it's a start. Anything else?

832
01:01:23,398 --> 01:01:25,730
I was thinking about
heading over to this Swan Casino.

833
01:01:25,831 --> 01:01:28,994
Vaughn works there. I don't know.
Ask a few questions, check it out.

834
01:01:29,094 --> 01:01:31,769
No, no, no. I'll send one of my guys.
Okay? You just...

835
01:01:31,869 --> 01:01:34,119
You've had a rough one, Bauhaus. Just...

836
01:01:34,219 --> 01:01:38,090
<i>hang at the station.
I'll hit you back when I need you.</i>

837
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:09,162
- Get started.
- Okay. Okay. Tom?

838
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:11,699
- Nice little party you got here.
- Hold this.

839
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:16,617
- Lucky there's a doctor on the bus.
- She's not a doctor. She's a vet student.

840
01:02:16,717 --> 01:02:18,609
Not so lucky then.

841
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:21,130
What's this?

842
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,779
- Pain meds.
- Right. Okay.

843
01:02:23,879 --> 01:02:27,080
Careful. I have thin veins.

844
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:41,590
- Holy shit, he's dead!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

845
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:46,068
What the fuck do you mean, he's dead?
What the fuck do you mean, he's dead?

846
01:02:47,735 --> 01:02:51,063
- What the fuck did you do?
- Ask the vet.

847
01:02:51,163 --> 01:02:54,378
- What the fuck you do, bitch?
- I didn't do... I didn't do anything!

848
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:56,781
- I didn't do anything!
- Well, you'd better do something!

849
01:02:56,881 --> 01:03:00,213
- Do CPR, something! Work on him!
- It wasn't her.

850
01:03:02,152 --> 01:03:04,755
Okay, what's in the bag?

851
01:03:05,796 --> 01:03:07,866
Tom, check his pulse!

852
01:03:08,766 --> 01:03:10,596
I think it's for you.

853
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,795
Don't die.

854
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,041
Mr. Pope?

855
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:22,931
You know, I see you every day, every day
on that floor for the past five years.

856
01:03:23,606 --> 01:03:28,907
And every day I think to myself, "Today's
the day Luke is going to come to the office,

857
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:31,322
ask to come back."

858
01:03:31,876 --> 01:03:33,489
That day never comes.

859
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:38,408
This isn't how I wanted it to go down.

860
01:03:38,508 --> 01:03:42,244
I know, but we do have a bit of a situation
on our hands. Wouldn't you say?

861
01:03:42,344 --> 01:03:45,504
Yeah. There doesn't seem
to be a whole lot of out.

862
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:48,808
<i>Well, here's one you might not
have considered. Put a bullet in Cox,</i>

863
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,578
<i>throw yourself and my money
into the man standing in front of you.</i>

864
01:03:51,678 --> 01:03:55,281
Everyone gets off the bus. No one knows
about my money or its origins.

865
01:03:55,381 --> 01:03:58,017
You get carted off to jail.
Except you never make it.

866
01:03:58,117 --> 01:04:01,021
Instead, you disappear
with enough cash to save Riley

867
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:05,926
- <i>and start a new life far away from here.</i>
- I wish I could believe you, Mr. Pope.

868
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:09,596
But you and I both know
you're a man that lives by his rules.

869
01:04:09,696 --> 01:04:12,419
I'd make an exception for an old friend.

870
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,801
But this is a right-now,
one-time deal only, pal.

871
01:04:14,902 --> 01:04:17,701
You need to fold your hand,
walk away from the table,

872
01:04:17,801 --> 01:04:21,368
- <i>or I'm taking your whole stack.</i>
- I appreciate the out.

873
01:04:21,968 --> 01:04:24,910
You and I both know
that's a sucker's bet.

874
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,740
You don't make exceptions.

875
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,159
Sorry. No deal.

876
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,923
Me too.

877
01:04:47,837 --> 01:04:49,441
No deal.

878
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:52,777
- What the fuck's going on?
- Detective Marconi here...

879
01:04:52,877 --> 01:04:54,778
is in Mr. Pope's back pocket.

880
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,774
What'd you do?

881
01:04:58,874 --> 01:05:01,363
What the fuck did you do?

882
01:05:02,391 --> 01:05:06,392
Did you kill my friend, you piece
of shit? Is that what you did?

883
01:05:06,492 --> 01:05:08,691
You kill my fucking friend?

884
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:13,968
Fucker!

885
01:05:14,868 --> 01:05:18,778
- What the fuck are you doing, Vaughn?
- No, you can't kill him. Just listen to me.

886
01:05:18,878 --> 01:05:22,763
To us, he's Pope's errand boy.
To the rest of the world, he's a cop.

887
01:05:22,863 --> 01:05:26,530
We kill a cop, the whole world
comes crashing down on us.

888
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:32,453
Get him off this fucking bus
or I'm gonna kill him!

889
01:05:37,994 --> 01:05:41,262
<i>Something is happening.
This is the bus 657 hostage situation.</i>

890
01:05:41,362 --> 01:05:44,368
<i>It appears that the bus
is slowing down now</i>

891
01:05:44,468 --> 01:05:46,604
<i>and the doors are opening.</i>

892
01:05:46,704 --> 01:05:50,708
<i>We're seeing now... Oh, my goodness.</i>

893
01:05:59,073 --> 01:06:01,771
Catch these motherfuckers!

894
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,350
- We've got a problem.
- What do you see?

895
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,823
SWAT bikes.

896
01:06:31,923 --> 01:06:34,355
Everybody get down! On the floor!

897
01:06:37,759 --> 01:06:40,076
Coming up on both sides.

898
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,999
Gas! Get on the floor!

899
01:06:56,344 --> 01:06:58,512
I can't see anything!

900
01:07:01,482 --> 01:07:03,751
Everybody get down!

901
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:26,744
- They're on the roof!
- They're on the fucking roof!

902
01:08:07,194 --> 01:08:10,063
- Motherfucker!
- Get behind the yellow line!

903
01:08:19,675 --> 01:08:21,278
Get off the road!

904
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:25,179
I can't hold it!

905
01:08:36,526 --> 01:08:37,960
He blew out a tire!

906
01:08:40,697 --> 01:08:43,231
- I can't control it!
- Go left!

907
01:08:52,743 --> 01:08:57,006
<i>Bus 657 has crashed just outside
of Galveston, Texas, as the police...</i>

908
01:08:57,106 --> 01:08:59,602
Oh, fuck!

909
01:09:09,634 --> 01:09:12,193
Stay below the window line.

910
01:09:12,642 --> 01:09:14,510
Stay down.

911
01:09:15,703 --> 01:09:18,033
What the fuck are you doing?

912
01:09:18,133 --> 01:09:22,212
- Let's go! Come on!
- Move, move!

913
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,801
We're surrounded. We're sitting ducks.

914
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:34,141
Oh, what'd you do now, boy?

915
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,611
Black out the fucking window, man.

916
01:09:38,997 --> 01:09:41,022
You got any more paint?

917
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:45,870
Flies around shit.

918
01:09:47,572 --> 01:09:49,943
<i>...to interrupt here,
but we do need to go to a live...</i>

919
01:09:50,343 --> 01:09:52,097
So what's the plan, detective?

920
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:54,380
One wrong move,
we're 10 million hits on YouTube.

921
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,950
Call your sniper section. I want
your boys in position 10 minutes ago.

922
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:00,686
Roger that. Snipers, get in position.

923
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:05,293
Get the the fuckin' news on the phone.

924
01:10:06,293 --> 01:10:08,829
Get the fuckin' news on the phone!

925
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:11,756
- Cox, what the fuck are you doing?
- I want my 15 seconds of fame.

926
01:10:11,856 --> 01:10:14,579
Cox, Cox, what the fuck are you doing?

927
01:10:16,365 --> 01:10:18,106
- You don't have to do this!
- What are you doing?

928
01:10:18,206 --> 01:10:20,972
- You don't have to do this!
- Shut the fuck up!

929
01:10:22,276 --> 01:10:24,179
- You got 'em?
- Please, Mr. Cox...

930
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:26,849
You got 'em? They on the phone?

931
01:10:26,949 --> 01:10:29,129
Cox, what are you doing, man?

932
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:33,523
- I think you need to see this.
- <i>...bus 657 hostage situation</i>

933
01:10:33,623 --> 01:10:37,997
<i>where we have one of the hijackers
on the line, ready to speak with us.</i>

934
01:10:38,297 --> 01:10:40,287
<i>Go ahead, live on the air.</i>

935
01:10:40,387 --> 01:10:44,406
Tell the cops to back off!
I'll kill this motherfucker!

936
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,804
I'm gonna kill him and everybody
on this goddamn bus!

937
01:10:48,004 --> 01:10:51,141
He's not going to kill a hostage
on live TV. Prepare to board the bus.

938
01:10:51,241 --> 01:10:52,742
- Sir?
- Do it!

939
01:10:52,842 --> 01:10:54,144
Please, don't. Please.

940
01:10:54,244 --> 01:10:56,786
- Shut up, shut up.
- Come on, man. Please.

941
01:11:00,883 --> 01:11:02,486
- Cox...
- Tell the cops to back off!

942
01:11:02,586 --> 01:11:03,687
- Cox...
- Shut the fuck up.

943
01:11:03,788 --> 01:11:07,090
Cox, we're not going to play it this way.
We can't do this. You can't kill him!

944
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:08,872
- Please, please.
- Shut the fuck up!

945
01:11:08,972 --> 01:11:11,027
Don't shoot me.

946
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:15,325
- You got a clear shot?
- <i>Negative, sir. I only see the hostage.</i>

947
01:11:15,435 --> 01:11:18,430
This death is on that man's conscience,
not mine!

948
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:21,103
- No. No.
- I'm in charge. I'm in charge!

949
01:11:23,607 --> 01:11:25,611
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

950
01:11:25,811 --> 01:11:27,079
Fuck!

951
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:30,930
All units withdraw.
I repeat, all units withdraw.

952
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:34,434
<i>I would like to apologize
to our viewers for that.</i>

953
01:11:34,534 --> 01:11:36,404
<i>I do not know what to say.</i>

954
01:11:36,504 --> 01:11:38,794
- It's a very... grave situation.
- This is unprecedented.

955
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:41,140
- We will continue to learn more on this.
- We apologize.

956
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:49,615
That should have never happened.

957
01:12:02,496 --> 01:12:05,799
- Hello.
- <i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

958
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,200
Princess.

959
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,175
What are you doing? Is everything okay?

960
01:12:14,575 --> 01:12:15,759
I'm fine, Dad.

961
01:12:15,859 --> 01:12:20,949
The nice policewoman said over here
that you're being a real, real hero.

962
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:23,550
<i>I'm proud of you, Dad.</i>

963
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,155
I love you so much. You know that?

964
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:31,844
All Daddy wants to do...

965
01:12:31,944 --> 01:12:35,833
is to make everything okay for you.
I just want you to feel better.

966
01:12:37,617 --> 01:12:40,561
If I could take all your pain away

967
01:12:40,661 --> 01:12:42,842
and make it mine,

968
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,675
I would. You know that?

969
01:12:44,775 --> 01:12:48,409
I know that, Dad. I love you too.

970
01:12:48,962 --> 01:12:52,615
- I'm gonna see you real soon, okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

971
01:12:56,451 --> 01:13:00,091
I know about the bills.
I know about the surgery.

972
01:13:00,191 --> 01:13:02,681
<i>You're not going to be able to get
that money here on time, Vaughn.</i>

973
01:13:02,781 --> 01:13:05,296
She is going to lose her spot.

974
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:08,967
I'll have that money there by 7:00.

975
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:11,170
<i>You and your psycho friend
just killed a hostage.</i>

976
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:13,721
So for the sake of your daughter...

977
01:13:14,174 --> 01:13:16,075
<i>give yourself up.</i>

978
01:13:16,175 --> 01:13:19,512
You have no idea
what's really going on here.

979
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:23,203
- It's not what it seems.
- <i>Yeah, well, it all seems pretty fucked.</i>

980
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:27,187
And unless that bus grows wings, you ain't
got a hope in shit to make it anyways.

981
01:13:27,287 --> 01:13:30,589
The only way off that bus
is with your hands up, man.

982
01:13:39,287 --> 01:13:44,376
<i>The wheels on the bus go round and round</i>

983
01:13:45,035 --> 01:13:47,862
<i>Round and round</i>

984
01:13:47,962 --> 01:13:49,580
<i>Round and round</i>

985
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:55,784
<i>The wheels on the bus go round and round</i>

986
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:01,595
<i>All day long</i>

987
01:14:03,593 --> 01:14:07,062
God damn it!
Get me off this fuckin' bus!

988
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:11,837
Fuck! God! Fuck!

989
01:14:11,937 --> 01:14:14,398
Get me out of here!

990
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:20,362
I got an idea.

991
01:14:25,316 --> 01:14:26,704
All right, detective, here's the deal.

992
01:14:26,804 --> 01:14:30,391
No more games. You fix the tire,
I release all the hostages but one.

993
01:14:30,491 --> 01:14:33,728
Once I get where I'm going,
I release the last hostage.

994
01:14:33,828 --> 01:14:37,032
Nobody follows us.
I see someone follow us...

995
01:14:37,132 --> 01:14:41,694
choppers, police escort...
I kill another fucking hostage.

996
01:14:41,794 --> 01:14:45,571
What do you think, detective?
This gonna work for you?

997
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,378
Deal.

998
01:14:49,878 --> 01:14:52,738
<i>Sending in a mechanic,
the bus is being repaired.</i>

999
01:14:52,838 --> 01:14:56,183
<i>And it appears we're close
to a resolution.</i>

1000
01:14:56,695 --> 01:14:57,654
Go.

1001
01:14:57,754 --> 01:15:00,636
<i>I spoke to your guys and they're
in position. So once the bus pulls out,</i>

1002
01:15:00,936 --> 01:15:03,180
it'll just be me
and your guys out there.

1003
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,995
We'll take the bus,
I'll put a bullet in Vaughn.

1004
01:15:06,095 --> 01:15:07,397
I'll get your money.

1005
01:15:07,497 --> 01:15:11,165
Sounds like a plan. Don't fuck it up.

1006
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:20,076
<i>All right, it appears that some of
the hostages are coming off of the bus now.</i>

1007
01:15:41,369 --> 01:15:45,542
<i>One hostage remains on the bus,
which now appears to be departing.</i>

1008
01:15:45,642 --> 01:15:49,261
<i>The police have ordered
news choppers not to follow.</i>

1009
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:53,123
That'll be $1.25, gentlemen.

1010
01:17:18,954 --> 01:17:22,348
Hey, Cox's Sucker!
She's ready and waiting, my brother.

1011
01:17:22,448 --> 01:17:24,028
He's a little indisposed at the moment.

1012
01:17:24,128 --> 01:17:26,631
Wanted me to call and tell you
we'd be there in 10, 15.

1013
01:17:26,731 --> 01:17:28,534
And there could be a change
in destination.

1014
01:17:28,634 --> 01:17:33,304
Roger that. She got enough fuel
to get you anywhere you want to go.

1015
01:17:56,883 --> 01:17:58,717
Hello?

1016
01:18:08,616 --> 01:18:10,857
Anybody here?

1017
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,643
Put it down.

1018
01:18:43,655 --> 01:18:45,692
You hungry?

1019
01:18:46,524 --> 01:18:48,393
Eat rock salt, motherfucker.

1020
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:57,307
<i>Marconi, please respond.</i>

1021
01:18:58,437 --> 01:19:01,914
This is a fuckin' shit storm. I'm done.
All right? I gotta get out of here.

1022
01:19:02,014 --> 01:19:04,545
I'm sorry, Mr. Pope,
but if we'd done this sh...

1023
01:19:05,064 --> 01:19:07,113
<i>Anyone seen Marconi?</i>

1024
01:19:22,288 --> 01:19:23,902
Welcome back, Vaughn.

1025
01:19:24,502 --> 01:19:26,722
I'd make this painless
for old time's sake.

1026
01:19:26,822 --> 01:19:30,843
Bullet-in-the-head kind of deal,
but we had a lot of cleaning to do.

1027
01:19:30,943 --> 01:19:33,221
What time is it?

1028
01:19:34,975 --> 01:19:37,012
7:15.

1029
01:19:38,183 --> 01:19:39,818
What are you laughing at?

1030
01:19:39,918 --> 01:19:44,285
You remember that card trick you used
to do all the time when I was a kid?

1031
01:19:44,385 --> 01:19:47,590
The one I could never figure out
'cause I was so busy watching the hand

1032
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:51,598
that was holding the deck when the magic
was really happening in the other hand?

1033
01:19:51,698 --> 01:19:53,300
What the fuck you talking about?

1034
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,044
I needed to get the money
to the hospital by 7:00.

1035
01:19:56,144 --> 01:19:59,107
That was the deadline.
Pay everything off by 7:00,

1036
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:03,646
<i>Riley continues her treatments,
she gets her surgery.</i>

1037
01:20:04,446 --> 01:20:07,550
So why are you smiling? You missed it.

1038
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:11,402
Are you sure about that?

1039
01:20:11,502 --> 01:20:15,456
Or you been too busy watching
the hand holding the deck?

1040
01:20:21,998 --> 01:20:23,764
Check the bag.

1041
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:29,577
Where's the money?

1042
01:20:29,677 --> 01:20:32,744
You forgot your own trick, Mr. Pope.

1043
01:20:32,844 --> 01:20:36,539
You were watching the wrong hand.
You forgot the magic.

1044
01:20:37,268 --> 01:20:39,153
Morning.

1045
01:20:41,357 --> 01:20:43,886
- Open the door!
- There is no "we."

1046
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:48,028
We pull this off and get out
of the Swan alive, I'm on my own.

1047
01:20:48,228 --> 01:20:52,664
That pregnant chick, she goes into labor?
They storm the bus. Hostages be damned.

1048
01:20:57,571 --> 01:20:58,606
That was great, sis.

1049
01:20:58,706 --> 01:21:00,809
I still don't understand
why I have to be pregnant.

1050
01:21:00,909 --> 01:21:03,151
Come on, who's going to suspect
a pregnant woman?

1051
01:21:03,251 --> 01:21:05,380
Where's the money?

1052
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:10,551
Is this going to take much longer?
There's just somewhere I really need to be.

1053
01:21:11,015 --> 01:21:13,620
Yeah, I'm her aunt, father's side.

1054
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,261
Your money's going to save
a little girl's life.

1055
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:24,001
- What about your life?
- That was a trade I was willing to make.

1056
01:21:24,501 --> 01:21:29,140
You're a fucking hero. Saves your little
girl's life by sacrificing your own.

1057
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,343
I'm touched. You see, you see...

1058
01:21:33,644 --> 01:21:35,613
that's $3 million.

1059
01:21:36,013 --> 01:21:37,656
So you know what I'm going to do?

1060
01:21:37,756 --> 01:21:41,669
First, I'm going to light a match
and I'm going to watch you burn.

1061
01:21:41,769 --> 01:21:43,755
Then I'm going down
to the hospital personally

1062
01:21:43,855 --> 01:21:46,341
and I'm gonna see your little girl.
And guess what?

1063
01:21:46,441 --> 01:21:50,161
I want you to think about
her suffering. Suffering...

1064
01:21:50,261 --> 01:21:53,663
- You're not going to touch my girl.
- I'm gonna touch her. You better believe it.

1065
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:58,703
What are you doing? What are you doing?
What are you trying to tell me? Yeah.

1066
01:21:59,838 --> 01:22:01,875
See how it's not funny, bitch?

1067
01:22:02,015 --> 01:22:05,112
Stealing $3 million is not
so fucking funny now, is it?

1068
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,511
Rule number 1 is
you never steal from us!

1069
01:22:07,611 --> 01:22:10,451
If you do, we'll make
an example out of a thief!

1070
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:14,539
Make sure you really know
that you can't steal from us or me!

1071
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,852
I'm gonna fuckin' light your ass up.

1072
01:22:20,994 --> 01:22:25,768
Fuck all. Time to light you the fuck up!

1073
01:22:25,868 --> 01:22:29,642
This ain't on my family.
This ain't on me. Don't touch my girl!

1074
01:22:48,991 --> 01:22:51,292
What a fuckin' day.

1075
01:23:37,218 --> 01:23:39,520
You gonna be okay?

1076
01:23:42,859 --> 01:23:46,298
You know, my mother, she was a nurse.

1077
01:23:47,266 --> 01:23:48,833
Good woman. Strong.

1078
01:23:49,586 --> 01:23:52,242
She used to say when people were...

1079
01:23:52,342 --> 01:23:56,308
dying, on their last breaths...
deathbed shit...

1080
01:23:56,408 --> 01:23:59,881
they'd open up with regrets,
things they wished they'd done different,

1081
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:02,950
stuff they were desperate to put right.

1082
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:05,577
So she had this saying.

1083
01:24:06,487 --> 01:24:09,323
"Regrets in death
meant you'd lived life wrong.

1084
01:24:09,423 --> 01:24:11,970
"Don't live life wrong, Frank."

1085
01:24:14,293 --> 01:24:16,030
Dogs me to a tee,

1086
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:19,035
would have made
the same mistakes I made.

1087
01:24:20,585 --> 01:24:24,748
I can't fix what I did,
but I can stop it from happening again.

1088
01:24:33,297 --> 01:24:35,466
I should go see my daughter.

1089
01:24:47,497 --> 01:24:49,966
You're a good dad, Vaughn.

1090
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:55,472
Thanks.

1091
01:25:06,117 --> 01:25:07,144
Yeah.

1092
01:25:07,244 --> 01:25:09,307
I didn't expect you to answer.
I thought you might be...

1093
01:25:09,407 --> 01:25:11,224
Dead?

1094
01:25:11,624 --> 01:25:13,255
Yeah, me too.

1095
01:25:13,355 --> 01:25:17,731
<i>Strange? You gonna arrest me,
Officer Bauhaus?</i>

1096
01:25:18,031 --> 01:25:21,902
Well, the weird thing is, I could've sworn
there were three hijackers.

1097
01:25:22,002 --> 01:25:24,238
<i>But everybody on the bus
said there were only two.</i>

1098
01:25:24,338 --> 01:25:26,574
Well, that is strange.

1099
01:25:27,941 --> 01:25:29,775
They're prepping Riley now.

1100
01:25:33,019 --> 01:25:34,747
<i>Vaughn.</i>

1101
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:38,723
Best news I've had all day.

1102
01:25:39,073 --> 01:25:41,864
What do you want me
to tell her when she wakes?

1103
01:25:42,962 --> 01:25:45,779
You tell her Daddy's coming home.

1104
01:25:46,305 --> 01:26:46,807
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
