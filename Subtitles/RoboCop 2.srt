1
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,550
MagnaVolt.
The final word in auto security.

2
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:11,667
No embarrassing alarm noise,
no need to trouble the police...

3
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,690
...and it won't even run down your battery.

4
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,650
MagnaVolt.

5
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,420
Lethal response.

6
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,179
On the international scene, the Amazon...

7
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:31,533
...nuclear power facility
has blown its stack...

8
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,188
...irradiating the world's
largest rain forest.

9
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:36,288
Environmentalists call it a disaster.

10
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,473
But don't they always?

11
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,543
In national news,
Attorney General Marcos today...

12
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:46,715
...approved the ED 209 combat unit
for deployment in five American cities...

13
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,968
...despite widespread complaints
of malfunction.

14
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,595
The surgeon general is dead.

15
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,933
Gunned down 20 minutes ago by a militant
addict of the deadly designer drug Nuke.

16
00:01:56,033 --> 00:02:00,329
The greatest health threat
facing our nation.

17
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,902
Nuke.

18
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,317
The most addictive narcotic in history.

19
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,633
A plague that...

20
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,516
Nuke! Nuke!

21
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,381
This station has just received
this transmission from Cain...

22
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,551
...convicted murderer
and leader of the Nuke cult.

23
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,776
The people want paradise.

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,640
And they will have it.

25
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,144
The assassination is the latest
act of terrorism by Cain...

26
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,907
...following the bombing...

27
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,940
...of a drug treatment
clinic that left five dead.

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,254
After the latest breakdown in negotiations,

29
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:49,778
Detroit's police returned
to the picket line...

30
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,574
...demanding better terms from
Omni Consumer Products, OCP...

31
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:57,619
...the corporation contracted by the city
to run the police department.

32
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,166
OCP cut our salaries 40 percent
and canceled our pensions.

33
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,002
Now they refuse to even talk to us.

34
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:08,502
God knows why,
but they want this strike.

35
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,642
What happened?

36
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,132
Get up!

37
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,455
Hold him!
- You put my eye out, you bitches!

38
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,599
Shut up, you fuckhead!

39
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,331
You're breaking my fucking arm!
- Hurry!

40
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,133
Look at this. What a nasty man.

41
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:38,178
Night's made. Let's pay Papa
and get us what we need.

42
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,278
Nuke me, baby!

43
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,244
I'll kill you bitches!
- He's up! Come on!

44
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,831
You're shit with a timer, man!
- Come on! Let's go!

45
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,948
I'll take out an army with this shit!

46
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,505
Let's load up and get the hell out of here!

47
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,423
Where's the bullets for this gun, man?

48
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,740
Third drawer, bottom.

49
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,887
We should've brought a truck!

50
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,416
I really like this gun, man.

51
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,168
Just take it and get out.

52
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,268
Thanks.

53
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,051
I don't believe this!
- What?

54
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,970
It's the cops, man.
- Cops are on strike, stupid.

55
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,114
Can't you hear that?

56
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,899
See. What did I tell you?
- I'll fix him.

57
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,208
Did you see that? We got him!

58
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,898
Beautiful. Come on, man. Let's move it.
- No. One more!

59
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,274
Nice shit, man.

60
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,942
Fucking cops!

61
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,998
Peace officer.

62
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,459
Think it over, creep.

63
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,766
Nuke.

64
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,938
It's not mine, man.

65
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,400
Where is it made?

66
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,053
It's not mine, man. I told you! I'm clean!

67
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,201
Where is it made?

68
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:17,071
I don't know, man!
All I know is where I get it!

69
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,791
Freeze.

70
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,852
Nobody move. This is a bust.

71
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,997
Ladies, stay down.

72
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,774
Somebody! Open the fridge, damn it!

73
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,526
Come on!

74
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,110
Can't shoot a kid, can you, fucker?

75
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,813
Can't shoot a kid...

76
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,443
Throw it home, Dad!

77
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,329
Shut up!

78
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:14,361
Drop it or the little shit's dead!
I'll blow its fucking head off, man!

79
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,196
Lewis...

80
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,296
...hang it up.

81
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,708
Now, no shit from either one of you!

82
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,877
And don't try to follow me!
- We won't.

83
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,587
The baby's going with me!

84
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,590
I'll kill it, man. I'll do
it. I'll fucking kill it!

85
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,984
We can't have that.

86
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,164
Nice shooting.

87
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,127
See you, Jimmy.

88
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,687
Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

89
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:54,061
Don't do it! No! Stop... Stop it, Alex!

90
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,380
OCP defines you as a machine...

91
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,890
...that utilizes some living tissue.
You understand that.

92
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,094
Yes.

93
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:34,476
And so do you consider yourself human?

94
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,062
I require an answer.

95
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,315
Stop tape.

96
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:48,515
You have any idea what you're doing
to that poor woman?

97
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,434
Take a look at her file.

98
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,227
Go on.

99
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:57,332
Officer, Mrs. Murphy
is bringing suit against OCP.

100
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,985
My name is Tom Delaney.
I'm representing her.

101
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:03,405
Up to a few months ago,
she wouldn't leave her bedroom.

102
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,408
Then there were hypnotists
and harmonic treatments.

103
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:10,496
Then you pull this shit!
Driving past her house day after day.

104
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:14,208
Spying on her. Trying to make her
think her husband is still alive.

105
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,252
She's barely started to accept the loss.

106
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:21,092
You're ripping her to pieces.
- And for what?

107
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:25,094
Do you think you could ever be
a husband to her?

108
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,863
I mean, what can you offer her?

109
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,155
Companionship?

110
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,117
Love?

111
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,663
A man's love?

112
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,304
No.

113
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,432
Roll tape.

114
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,939
Are you Alex Murphy?

115
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,719
No.

116
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,819
Are you human?

117
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,182
No.

118
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,660
You are simply a machine.

119
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,119
I am...

120
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,441
...a machine.

121
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,541
Nothing more.

122
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,876
Nothing more.

123
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,590
That'll do it. Stop tape.

124
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:37,499
Now, you stay there.
All right, go get her.

125
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,378
Let's be decent about this.
Give them some privacy.

126
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,283
I don't have a problem with that.

127
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,826
Alex?

128
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,997
Don't you know me?

129
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,711
Don't you remember me?

130
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,380
Alex, it doesn't matter
what they've done to you...

131
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Touch me.

132
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,881
It's cold.

133
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,192
They made this...

134
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,317
...to honor him.

135
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:19,910
No, I...
- Your husband is dead.

136
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,454
I don't know you.

137
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,443
Why is this happening?

138
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:13,697
I thought all communication systems
were the same.

139
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:17,197
I tried to save the company a few bucks.

140
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:21,555
It took two days to download specs
from Cleveland.

141
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,225
I lost the account.

142
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,361
It hardly befits my dignity
to have to come to you, Johnson.

143
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,155
Sorry for the slight inconvenience,
Your Honor.

144
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,616
Twenty minutes in rush hour isn't slight.

145
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,827
Not when you're mayor of a major city!

146
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:03,622
When will you start paying the cops
so they'll go back to work?

147
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,541
We're not a charity.

148
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,960
The city owes us over $37 million.

149
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,630
You'll have to cut us some slack.
- A deadline's a deadline. Sorry.

150
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,258
How are we supposed to raise
that kind of money?

151
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,358
You aren't.

152
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:20,222
What the hell is he talking about?
- We don't expect you to pay.

153
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,127
Let me refer you to our contract.

154
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,019
'In the event of default...

155
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:32,409
...OCP shall have the uncontested right
of foreclosure on all city assets.'

156
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,112
You signed this.

157
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,906
We miss one payment,
and you can foreclose?

158
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,006
We can and we will.

159
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,536
We're taking Detroit private.

160
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,247
So you deliberately undermined our credit.

161
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,558
That was the easy part.

162
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,919
And you engineered the police strike.

163
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,255
You want Detroit to tear itself apart...

164
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:56,425
...so you can raid it like you would
any other corporation!

165
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,677
Do you know how many people are dying?

166
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,095
You're murderers!

167
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,140
I'd advise you to say nothing further.
It might be...

168
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,558
...actionable.

169
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,658
It's bullshit!

170
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,646
Bullshit, you senile, old bastard!
- All right, calm down.

171
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,940
We better get out of here.
- I'm okay!

172
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,193
Calm down. We better leave.
- I'm calm.

173
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,487
Calm down. Easy.
- I'm okay.

174
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:17,946
All right, good.

175
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,350
I'm in control. Everything
is fine. It's okay.

176
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,450
Relax.

177
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,285
I'm fine.

178
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,412
One last thing, gentlemen.

179
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,247
We will sue your asses.

180
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,347
Give it your best shot.

181
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:33,170
Fuck you, you old, senile bastard!
This is bullshit!

182
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,963
Fuck you!

183
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,649
This is bullshit!
- Calm down.

184
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,532
I've been very patient, Johnson.
Five months.

185
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,394
Who's that?
- That's Dr. Juliette Faxx.

186
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:51,146
Just moved up to head the
Attitude Adjustment team.

187
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:55,334
Five months. Ninety million dollars!

188
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:02,695
I want to see some results.
- Yes, sir. I'll show you what we have.

189
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:05,594
OCP pioneered cyborg technology.

190
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,414
And now we take a quantum leap forward.

191
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,874
State-of-the-art
destructive capabilities...

192
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:15,712
...commanded by a unique combination
of software and organic systems.

193
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,549
In every way,
an improvement over the original.

194
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:23,494
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you, Robocop 2.

195
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:36,834
You are under arrest.

196
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,587
Stop or I'll shoot.

197
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:44,258
Stop or I'll shoot.

198
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:57,171
OCP is proud to present the future
of urban pacification:

199
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,271
Robocop 2.

200
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,751
Ninety million.

201
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,045
They all go crazy.

202
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,575
Robots with emotional problems.

203
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:29,219
No, sir, not robots, cyborgs.

204
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:33,624
Cybernetic organisms. We use living human
tissue and that's our whole problem.

205
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:36,835
The candidates were all fine men,
respected police officers.

206
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:39,004
I reviewed their files myself.

207
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:43,592
Sir, police officers may not be
the best candidates for our purposes.

208
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,386
They're a physical bunch.
They're macho, body-proud.

209
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:50,057
Stripped of all that it's no wonder
they become suicidal.

210
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,409
Our one success was a cop.

211
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,062
Well, yes, Mr. Johnson. Alex Murphy.

212
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:58,190
Top of his class,
devout Irish Catholic, family man.

213
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,485
Everything in his profile
indicates a fierce sense of duty.

214
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,487
That's probably what kept him alive.

215
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:07,449
With due respect, Dr. Faxx,
your area of expertise is psychology.

216
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,992
Not robotics.

217
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,204
There's no harm in hearing
the young lady out, is there?

218
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:13,622
No, sir.

219
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:17,793
Thank you, sir. I believe that Murphy's case
was unusual but not unique.

220
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:22,423
We can find someone else, someone
to whom the prospect might even be...

221
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,523
...desirable.

222
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,429
I've never met anyone who wanted
to be a robot.

223
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:32,433
It would require a screening process,
one I'd would be happy to supervise.

224
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,998
The cost would be negligible.

225
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,897
It would be a shame
to waste all the work that's been done.

226
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,997
It certainly would.

227
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,761
Go to it. Report to me directly.

228
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,877
Yes, sir.

229
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:51,387
You could learn a thing or two
from that girl, Johnson.

230
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,431
not for me!

231
00:25:56,515 --> 00:26:00,727
Decent pay to decent cops!

232
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:08,844
Union's got a list!
We ain't forgetting who you are!

233
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,944
One at a time!

234
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:16,410
Please, one at a time.

235
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:23,105
Don't you know what's going on out here?

236
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,917
It's the best we can do!

237
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,798
Hello, ladies!

238
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,830
They won't be fucking with any more cops!

239
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,245
They won't be fucking with nobody, man!

240
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:20,057
Hob. That's him.

241
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,226
Thank you.

242
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,773
Nuke me!

243
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,280
Go ahead. Take two.

244
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:39,258
There's plenty of Nuke to go around.

245
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,603
I've lost him.

246
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,564
You haven't been around in a while.

247
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,959
Go ahead. This one's on me.

248
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,502
Five degrees south-southwest.

249
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,988
There's the little darling.

250
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,406
Good eyes, Murphy.

251
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,675
Good as money can buy.

252
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Ferdy, you got out.

253
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,347
Well, I'll tell Cain, okay?

254
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:13,524
Better have something
to give me this time, officer.

255
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,448
One cop per car.
Okay, these are the routes.

256
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,993
Three cars.

257
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:22,978
One cop per car?
- That's right.

258
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:28,348
Sitting ducks. We set up three
snipers and that's all it takes.

259
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,378
Pay the man.
- All right.

260
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,821
Thank you.

261
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,115
You didn't count it.
- That's all right.

262
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,326
You should really count it, you know.

263
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:38,827
It's okay.

264
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:43,177
Give him something
to help him with his conscience.

265
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,669
No, that's all right.
I don't really want it.

266
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,744
Come on, Duffy. I know you need it.

267
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,543
Isn't this a school day?

268
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,590
Cops!

269
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,969
Oh, shit!

270
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,687
Oh, no.

271
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,249
Freeze!

272
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,094
Turn around. Put your hands up.

273
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:12,644
Shit.

274
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,829
Officer Duffy, have a seat.

275
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:38,358
You look a little out of breath, bitch.

276
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:45,662
You sold us out, Officer Duffy.
- What are you talking about, Murph?

277
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,557
Where is Cain?

278
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,393
I don't know any Cain.

279
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:55,606
Where is Cain?

280
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:58,150
I don't know.

281
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:07,618
Where is Cain?!

282
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,245
I told you, I don't know!

283
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,771
Where?

284
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:38,744
River Rouge. The old sludge plant.

285
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,069
You're a rotten cop.

286
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,283
Go.

287
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:50,317
You.
- You want me?

288
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Dead or alive.

289
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:56,069
Then one of us must die.

290
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:58,198
Dead, then.

291
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:23,417
Jesus...

292
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:25,644
...had days like this.

293
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:29,840
Hounded and attacked like a criminal.

294
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,026
But like him, I don't blame you.

295
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:35,788
They program you, and you do it.

296
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:41,243
I will kill you.
- Oh, you just tried.

297
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,979
And...

298
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,079
...I forgive you.

299
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:00,055
Why'd you stop? You got it cracked.

300
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,807
I'm tired.

301
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:05,562
They say he's got a brain.
I want to see it.

302
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,901
You think it was me that beat you?

303
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,001
It wasn't.

304
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,420
It was this.

305
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:35,063
It's too tough.

306
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,526
Try here at the joint.

307
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:45,407
Yeah!

308
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,121
Look at that!

309
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,551
Come on. Cut it out.

310
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,472
How's it taste?

311
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:21,945
What the hell's going on?!

312
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:24,323
Man, just look at him.

313
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:28,620
Christ, he's been stripped.

314
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:44,993
Let's not get carried away here.
We're talking about a piece of equipment.

315
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,643
Don't tell me he can't suffer.

316
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:49,888
Just look at him.

317
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,434
It's electrical.

318
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,518
Bullshit.

319
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:57,423
I know every inch of him.
Every circuit.

320
00:39:57,523 --> 00:39:59,566
Every living nerve.

321
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:03,721
His pain centers are alive.
They're lit up like Christmas trees.

322
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:06,765
The back-up generator's
just making him twitch.

323
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:08,865
He's suffering.

324
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:10,561
How long can he last?

325
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,661
No way of knowing.

326
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,550
Got him on minimal life support.

327
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,818
Keeping the brain going with microshocks.

328
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:25,425
It's damn tricky. He could go anytime.
- Move. Move!

329
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:28,412
What's happening in here?

330
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:33,083
OCP is happening. These bastards
won't lift a finger to help him.

331
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:36,128
This unit needs
millions of dollars in parts.

332
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:40,340
You can't expect authorization for that
kind of cash overnight. Be reasonable.

333
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,259
If you don't fix him, it's murder.

334
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,679
Settle down. I'm doing you
a favor by talking to you.

335
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:49,074
You son of a bitch. He's in hell.

336
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:54,244
Fix him!

337
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:57,038
We'll be in touch.

338
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:07,034
Oh, man, you guys are the greatest!

339
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:09,174
Did you see their faces?

340
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,661
'We're gonna throw away the key, Duffy.'

341
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,668
The cops didn't give you trouble,
did they?

342
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:20,881
The usual shit from Reed.
They'll never prove anything.

343
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,382
Hey, want some?

344
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:26,392
Hey, I'm a minor.
Don't want to break any laws.

345
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,555
Here, you take it.

346
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,991
God, I just love you guys!

347
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:37,621
What happened?

348
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:39,915
Hey, where we going?

349
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,153
Hey, come on, guys.
This isn't funny, man.

350
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:45,253
Oh, God, my head.

351
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:48,425
My head is killing me.

352
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,370
Hey, man. What's...?

353
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,057
Hey, Cain! Hey, it's good to see you.

354
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,350
Thanks for getting me out.

355
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:00,921
I can't get up.
- You noticed that one.

356
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:04,633
Cain, I don't know what the kid told you...
- You told them, Duffy.

357
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,136
You told them where we were.
- That's not true.

358
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:13,016
We know all about it, Duffy.
- You think you're the only cop we have?

359
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:16,618
Oh, shit!

360
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:19,148
Cain. Cain, come on.
Man, I'm begging you, man!

361
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:21,667
Look, I'll do anything!

362
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:25,070
Okay. You're kidding, right?
Yeah, you're just kidding.

363
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,174
You scared me.
You taught me a lesson, man.

364
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:32,494
I'd never fuck with you,
because I really love you guys.

365
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:34,638
I really do!
- Shut up!

366
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:40,502
I've been loyal. I know shit
that I still haven't even told you, Cain!

367
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:43,630
You deserve this, Duffy.
Cain might have been killed.

368
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,215
Okay. Okay.

369
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:48,545
Maybe you ought to have the kid leave.

370
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:52,602
Why?
- What do you mean, 'have the kid leave'?

371
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:58,468
That's a good touch. That's a good touch.
'Have the kid leave.'

372
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:02,603
That's good.'Have the kid leave. ' Why?

373
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,253
Come on. It's over.

374
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:10,498
Come on, Cain! Come on, man.
What are you doing?

375
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,425
Come on!

376
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,719
You said you were just gonna scare him!

377
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,863
Doesn't he look scared?

378
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,359
I can't believe you'd do this.

379
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:48,487
It hardly matters what you believe,
Mr. Schenk.

380
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:51,448
But these are criminals.
They're maniacs.

381
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:54,948
You're giving premature value judgments.

382
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:59,456
All right, it may be true.
The subjects are socially misaligned.

383
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:02,584
Socially misaligned?
These are death row inmates!

384
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:06,338
And of no use to society. We need a
subject who'll welcome the power...

385
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,424
...the virtual immortality we offer.

386
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:13,369
Now, I really think this is a good place
to start looking.

387
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:18,642
You're out of your mind.
- Is that your professional opinion?

388
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:21,245
Yes, goddamn it, it is! Yes!

389
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:25,774
And you are not using my lab to put
that kind of a brain into my cyborg.

390
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:28,084
We'd dearly miss you here.

391
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,073
You're the one that's gonna be
out of a job.

392
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:36,828
I'm going to take this directly to Johnson.

393
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:41,557
He's just been waiting for an excuse
to get you fired.

394
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:50,939
Good morning, sir.

395
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:54,458
I'm sorry to bother you this early.

396
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,764
You seem agitated.

397
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,158
Frankly, I'm shocked.

398
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,226
Mr. Schenk just called.

399
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:05,064
Dr. Faxx has begun screening
candidates for the Robocop 2 project...

400
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:09,001
So I understand. It's very exciting.

401
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:12,112
She's screening psychotics, sir.
Murderers.

402
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:15,157
We aren't planning to build a toy,
Johnson.

403
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:16,784
Faxx knows what she's doing.

404
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:21,080
She's keeping Robocop offline.
It's a public-relations disaster.

405
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,750
You've got to learn to look
at the larger picture. The foreclosure.

406
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,044
You must know how important that is to us.

407
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:31,090
With Robocop out of commission, the
chaos down there will increase...

408
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,926
...and the odds the city will fall
into our hands.

409
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:38,764
But a competent executive would find a way
to deal with the corporate image problem.

410
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:42,349
Couldn't agree with you more,
Mr. Johnson.

411
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,728
Fortunately, I have found a way.

412
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:48,653
Yes, Ms. Faxx and I have
already discussed it.

413
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:53,337
I know you'll help to implement her ideas.

414
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:55,322
Of course, sir. Whatever I can do.

415
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:57,032
Anything else?

416
00:45:57,132 --> 00:46:00,052
Coffee?
- No, thank you.

417
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:03,492
Don't forget your shoes on the way out.

418
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:38,532
He's my patient and critical.
I must stay with him.

419
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,534
We'll let you know when we need you.

420
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:43,829
Nobody on your staff has my experience
with him. You need me.

421
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:45,497
We don't need anybody.

422
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:48,917
'We.' Who the hell are 'we'?
You're a lawyer who knows nothing!

423
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:52,296
You're exactly this far
from getting fired, babe.

424
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:54,396
Shyster!

425
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,315
He's one of mine.

426
00:46:57,651 --> 00:47:00,031
I want him back on his feet.

427
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:01,237
Maybe he will be,

428
00:47:01,337 --> 00:47:03,557
or maybe we'll just sell
the parts for scrap.

429
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,392
That's up to us.

430
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:08,212
You see, Robocop's off warranty.

431
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:13,400
Robocop's command program...

432
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,004
...his set of directives...

433
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:21,408
It determines his behavior.
It's time to update the program...

434
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:25,588
...and I would like to hear
from each one of you.

435
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,582
It's about time they asked us.

436
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:31,794
We're getting a lot of heat
from parents' groups.

437
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:34,588
Personally, I don't blame them.
I'm a parent.

438
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:36,924
All that destructive behavior.

439
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:39,760
He's become a role model for our children.

440
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,513
Now, what are we teaching them?
- You have a point.

441
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:46,433
If he talked things out with people
instead of firing that gun.

442
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:49,937
Couldn't he take a little time
to address environmental issues?

443
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,146
What was that?

444
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,732
He could speak out on environmental issues.

445
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,442
Don't see any reason why not.

446
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,152
For all the shooting he does...

447
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:01,198
...I've never once seen him take the time
to do anything nice...

448
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:05,202
...like visit an orphanage.
- You're absolutely right.

449
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,912
Or help a cat out of a tree...

450
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:09,790
...or go door to door collecting
for the Red Cross...

451
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,628
...or maybe even roasting some
marshmallows with some Cub Scouts.

452
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:20,275
Why, Mr. Johnson, that is wonderful.
Thank you so much.

453
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:28,559
It's no good. The program isn't uploading.
- He's resisting.

454
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:29,935
There's too much data.

455
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:35,607
No, it's him. Leave him to me, Schenk.
- I can't... It's not going to work!

456
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:37,651
You're wasting valuable time.

457
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,504
Don't resist us.
- Let me up.

458
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:43,088
I must go.

459
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:46,716
Go where?

460
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:52,249
Do what? Go dancing? Fall in love?
What is it you think you are?

461
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,349
Alex Murphy.

462
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:57,337
That's a delusion.

463
00:48:57,437 --> 00:49:01,300
It's a glitch in your system.
Alex Murphy is dead.

464
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,012
Take away the metal and wires,
you're just a couple chunks on a table.

465
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,281
You're not even a corpse.

466
00:49:09,658 --> 00:49:11,658
What are you?

467
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,495
Respond.

468
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:19,626
I am Officer Alex Murphy...

469
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,361
...Detroit Police Department.

470
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:23,461
That won't do.

471
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:32,095
What are you?

472
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:38,228
Robocop. Crime Prevention Unit.

473
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,381
OCP.

474
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:42,858
Better. Much better.

475
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,693
I type it. You think it.

476
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:51,617
You type it. I think it.

477
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:55,396
What a wonderful opportunity you represent.

478
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:57,961
Psychotherapy, it's such a...

479
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:03,362
It's a slow, clumsy practice.
But with you this is so simple.

480
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:05,462
Direct.

481
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:13,789
You're lucky.

482
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:18,836
We can do in moments with you what
would take years with a human patient.

483
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:21,271
I'm really very lucky.

484
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:27,761
You're free. You're free from doubt.
Free from having to make painful choices.

485
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:29,861
I am free.

486
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:32,531
He's ready.

487
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,785
Uploading command program.

488
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:42,527
I am so glad we had this chance
to dialogue.

489
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:56,248
Look at you. It's like you're brand-new.

490
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:57,791
Thank you. Thank you.

491
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,002
You really had us worried there, Murphy.

492
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:01,545
I'm touched.

493
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:03,645
Get this guy.

494
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,148
He's touched.

495
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:12,007
That's enough. All of you,
back to your posts. Come on. Let's go.

496
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:15,893
How you feeling, Murphy?

497
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:19,663
I'm just fine, Warren.
Thank you for asking.

498
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,982
Let's get you downstairs.

499
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:25,652
I want to see what those amateurs
at OCP screwed up.

500
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:29,173
Pity. It's a beautiful morning.

501
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:31,715
Shame to waste it.

502
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,579
Ready for duty, partner?
- You betcha.

503
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:38,484
Let's go.
- Nothing I'd rather do.

504
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:42,044
He sounds terrific.

505
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:44,144
Something's wrong.

506
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:13,215
Harder!

507
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:28,292
It's Robo!
Everybody out the back door!

508
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:32,822
It's locked!
- It won't open!

509
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:39,324
Murph, wake up, will you?

510
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,292
Good morning.

511
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:56,260
Come on, take him out.

512
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,517
I think we should talk.

513
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:09,481
What's with you, Murph?

514
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:19,767
Where'd they go?
- 'Where'd they go?'

515
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:23,704
They're still here,
the little bastards!

516
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,999
Hands up! Let's go! Everybody up!

517
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:30,632
Move it. Up against the wall.

518
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:32,836
Let's go.

519
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:43,911
Hands on top of your heads.
Nobody move.

520
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:46,185
You are under arrest.

521
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:48,712
You have the right to remain silent.

522
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:52,424
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...

523
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:55,386
...in a court of law.
- He's dead, Murphy.

524
00:53:55,486 --> 00:54:00,416
You have the right...
- You're reading Miranda to a corpse!

525
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:06,622
I'm having trouble.

526
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:18,381
Oh, my.

527
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:21,678
This isn't very nice.

528
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,916
Though you may think
you're having fun now...

529
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:29,436
...you only hurt the one you love.

530
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:32,648
Think of Mom and Dad.

531
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:35,342
What kind of lesson are you teaching them?

532
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:38,654
And now, a word on nutrition.

533
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:40,781
Shit! He's fucked up!

534
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:44,618
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

535
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,228
Let's go!

536
00:54:46,328 --> 00:54:47,980
The point is...

537
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,374
...we all have to work.

538
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:53,083
I haven't finished.

539
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:56,419
Hit the gas, Murphy.

540
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,842
The posted limit is 35.

541
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:02,560
We should set an example, Anne.

542
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:08,100
Your hair looks lovely that way.

543
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:11,368
It's OCP. They did something to you.

544
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:13,395
I'm fine.

545
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:19,872
Isn't the moon wonderful tonight?

546
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:22,028
It's still daytime.

547
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,308
It's the thought that counts.

548
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:30,443
Oh, Jesus, we're heading back
to the station. That's all there is to it.

549
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:45,704
What the hell are you doing?!

550
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:47,931
Waste makes haste...

551
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:51,143
...for time is fleeting.

552
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:55,272
A rolling stone is worth two in the bush.

553
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:58,374
Go fuck a refrigerator, pecker neck!

554
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:03,555
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

555
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:05,655
You're nuts!

556
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:11,747
Murphy, come on, let's go.

557
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,290
Come on!

558
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Back!

559
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:34,019
Thank you for not smoking.

560
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,365
Well, there it is. It's OCP.

561
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,949
They screwed him up.

562
00:56:48,951 --> 00:56:51,311
He must be going out of his mind.

563
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,856
It's not as if he can just say no.

564
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:59,169
They put all this nonsense
into his brain. He has to obey.

565
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:01,155
Take them out, all of them!

566
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:03,907
Can't be done,
not with this equipment.

567
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:07,202
Are you saying there's no way?
I can't believe that.

568
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:10,581
Sure, there are ways.
You can pull his cranial circuits.

569
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:13,083
Which would shut down his life-support.

570
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:16,795
You could run a few thousand volts
through him.

571
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:18,895
Probably kill him.

572
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:12,908
I'll get some help!

573
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:26,156
Get him inside!
- Come on, move it!

574
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:28,492
Come on!
- Don't touch him, he's hot!

575
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,202
Use your jackets.

576
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:31,662
Why'd he do that?

577
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:34,706
Fried himself to get rid
of OCP's crazy commands.

578
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:37,726
Nice and easy.
- He weighs a ton.

579
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:46,900
Out of the way! Move out!

580
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:54,309
Think he's alive?
- I don't know. He's pretty hot.

581
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:56,409
Put me down.

582
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:03,471
All right. Come on, stand him up.

583
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:19,017
Are we cops?

584
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:20,961
What's bugging you, Murph?

585
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:23,061
Cain.

586
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:25,340
Cain's bugging me.

587
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,777
We have only just begun, my flock.

588
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:31,680
Soon we will expand from city to city.

589
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,308
The rich and poor alike
will know a paradise...

590
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:37,494
...for every moment of their lives.

591
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:40,873
This is a Nuke for every mood.

592
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:42,649
We'll offer the opportunity...

593
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:46,487
...to control every aspect
of their emotional lives.

594
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:49,156
Here with the white noise
and black thunder...

595
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:52,843
...and the red ramrod and the blue velvet.

596
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:55,762
Frank. The blue velvet.

597
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:57,886
I think it's ready, sir.

598
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:04,811
Thank you, Frank.

599
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:20,954
Frank. The Benzedrine's
got my teeth wiggling.

600
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,123
Cut it with scopolamine.

601
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:25,918
Five mils per.
- Yes, sir.

602
01:00:28,545 --> 01:00:30,545
Made in America.

603
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:34,711
Yeah. We're gonna make that
mean something again.

604
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:40,332
Hey! Cops!
- What?

605
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:42,209
Cops!

606
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,813
And they ain't carrying no picket signs!

607
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:49,333
They're going to kick somebody's ass!

608
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:10,278
Give me your hand, goddamn it!

609
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:31,643
Christ!

610
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:35,063
Fuck.

611
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,191
Fuck!

612
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,527
Get out!

613
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,612
Bomb! Get down!

614
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:29,828
You son of a bitch!

615
01:06:24,485 --> 01:06:28,138
Five hundred million in cash.
Nuke money seized by police.

616
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:32,559
But State Attorney Sphincter won't let
the bankrupt city government touch it.

617
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:36,730
Coming up next, threats from the police
union and cheers from the public...

618
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:41,318
...as Metro-North cops go back to work
and apprehend the Nuke lord, Cain...

619
01:06:41,418 --> 01:06:44,393
...who may not live to stand trial.

620
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:51,754
They say 20 seconds
in the California sunshine...

621
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:54,723
...is too much these days...

622
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:57,459
...ever since we lost the ozone layer.

623
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:02,773
But that was before Sunblock 5000.

624
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:06,109
Just apply a pint...

625
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:08,193
...to your body...

626
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:11,406
...and you're good for hours.

627
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:15,118
See you by the pool.

628
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,670
Sunblock 5000.

629
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:28,298
Protection for the new age.

630
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:30,993
Subject is violently antisocial...

631
01:07:31,093 --> 01:07:34,721
...given to delusions of godhood.

632
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:38,642
And he's hopelessly addicted to narcotics.

633
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:42,254
Which offers us a simple
and infallible method...

634
01:07:42,354 --> 01:07:45,816
...of insuring his obedience.

635
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:54,990
You're perfect.

636
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:57,868
I must have you.

637
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:04,610
What are you talking about?
It's like you don't even care!

638
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,738
Just do what I say, Angie!
- He'd want us to come for him!

639
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:11,492
Forget about it! It's not gonna happen!
I'm through arguing with you!

640
01:08:11,592 --> 01:08:16,038
I'm not asking permission! Cain is
in the hospital, and we're getting him.

641
01:08:16,138 --> 01:08:19,833
You've really thought this out, haven't you?
What about the cops?

642
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:21,460
We've got guns!

643
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,960
Damn it, Hob, Cain needs us!
- Fuck Cain!

644
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:29,426
He'd kill you if he heard you.
- He's not gonna kill anybody!

645
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:32,721
Shit, he's probably dead already.
- You just shut the hell up!

646
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:38,516
You mouth off like that again,
and it's no more Nuke for you, bitch.

647
01:08:38,827 --> 01:08:41,647
Damn it, Hob, you know that's not fair.

648
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:43,357
Now, come on.

649
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:47,236
It's been a bad time.
- Sure has. You're really hurting.

650
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:48,862
Yeah, so I'm hurting.

651
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:52,116
You're gonna get the shakes soon, Angie.

652
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:54,216
You got it bad.

653
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:57,719
You little bastard.

654
01:09:00,724 --> 01:09:04,634
You just do what I tell you
from now on, Angie.

655
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:07,856
Start the motor and drive.

656
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:12,651
He'll kill you.

657
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,820
He'll kill us both.

658
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,280
Fuck him.

659
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:34,341
Oh, you're a mess.

660
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,050
I got good news for you.

661
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:42,666
You're going to have a chance
for immortality.

662
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:46,761
As long as nothing happens
to that lovely brain.

663
01:09:55,737 --> 01:09:58,740
Dr. Weltman? It's Faxx.

664
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:01,268
I'm afraid we lost our patient.

665
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:03,537
Yeah, he just expired.

666
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:10,587
Contact the organ harvest team. We've got
six minutes before the brain's useless.

667
01:10:20,137 --> 01:10:22,137
Night.

668
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:38,277
Come on. Let's move it.
We've only got five minutes.

669
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:40,489
Lock it up.

670
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:49,608
Move the screen in closer.
I can't read it.

671
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:54,421
How'd we get this one?
- Well, Faxx found him.

672
01:10:55,172 --> 01:10:57,174
He volunteered.

673
01:10:57,299 --> 01:10:59,159
Volunteered?

674
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:01,036
Big-hearted guy.

675
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:04,876
Yeah, it's not the heart
we're after, though.

676
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:09,520
Speaking of hearts, how's Ilene?

677
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,941
Christ, does everybody know?

678
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:38,551
All right, hold your breath.

679
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:43,220
Showtime.

680
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:48,089
It's nice and clean in here.
There's no damage.

681
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,670
Here we go.

682
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,770
Easy.

683
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:57,818
We got it. Here it comes.

684
01:11:57,985 --> 01:12:00,571
Thing of beauty.
- Excellent.

685
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:04,904
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm hungry.

686
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:22,803
Thank you!

687
01:13:22,903 --> 01:13:24,263
Yes!

688
01:13:24,363 --> 01:13:26,056
Spider Baby Stalirski!

689
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:29,727
He's come out for Detroit,
and now you come out for him.

690
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:33,147
The lines are open,
waiting for your pledge.

691
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:35,274
If you want an honest government...

692
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:37,414
...that works for you...

693
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:42,589
...I'm asking you to dig deep
into your pockets.

694
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:45,676
I'm asking you to give...

695
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:48,720
...whatever you can spare!

696
01:13:48,846 --> 01:13:50,846
Where does that put us?

697
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:57,463
Hi. Yes, ma'am.

698
01:13:57,563 --> 01:13:59,590
Hello! This is Mayor Kuzak!

699
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:02,835
Could you turn down your set, please?

700
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:08,572
Your Honor...

701
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,970
...I have some very good news for you.

702
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:13,979
I think...

703
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,456
...the city is saved.

704
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:19,374
Now...

705
01:14:19,459 --> 01:14:22,337
...you listen very carefully.

706
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,200
It's no bluff.
Someone's shown up to bail the city out.

707
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,328
A rival corporation.
- The mayor isn't saying.

708
01:14:29,428 --> 01:14:33,165
And whoever it is is taking great
pains to keep their identity secret.

709
01:14:33,265 --> 01:14:37,169
They're paying in cash and they're not
moving the money through the banks.

710
01:14:37,269 --> 01:14:39,730
Thank you, councilman.

711
01:14:41,356 --> 01:14:43,356
That will be all.

712
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:45,886
You know, once you guys take over...

713
01:14:45,986 --> 01:14:50,115
Your services to OCP will be rewarded.

714
01:14:53,535 --> 01:14:57,164
If the city can pay,
we'll be humiliated.

715
01:14:57,247 --> 01:15:00,859
It's worse than that. We've shifted
80 percent of our resources...

716
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:03,237
...to the urban pacification plan.

717
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:08,367
If we can't foreclose, public confidence
in OCP will plummet, so will our stock.

718
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:10,035
Sir?

719
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:11,537
If I may?

720
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:13,637
There's another option.

721
01:15:14,473 --> 01:15:18,794
We certainly have the surveillance
capabilities to follow the mayor.

722
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:22,549
It all depends how far we're willing to go.

723
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:26,385
If anything went wrong...

724
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,262
As I said, sir...

725
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:30,764
...it all depends how far
we're willing to go.

726
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:34,576
We have no legal recourse.

727
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:46,363
There must be no witnesses.

728
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:49,098
You've gone too far! Give me...

729
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:50,743
Your blood pressure.

730
01:15:50,843 --> 01:15:54,621
Get me fired if you want to.
You're not bringing illegal drugs to my lab!

731
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:59,141
I'll do worse than get you fired.
Now leave me alone!

732
01:16:07,651 --> 01:16:10,279
Such terrible pain.

733
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:17,119
You don't remember me.

734
01:16:18,203 --> 01:16:21,263
But you do remember this, don't you?

735
01:16:26,879 --> 01:16:30,704
And we have it.
All the Nuke you'll ever need.

736
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:38,722
Not so fast.

737
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:42,249
I need you to do something for me first.

738
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:44,771
Then the pain stops.

739
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,399
Good boy.

740
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:11,156
I don't like this. I think we'd better
get out of here while we can.

741
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:13,256
I know what I'm doing.

742
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:46,442
If you have any cash,
put it in your shorts.

743
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,669
That's just plain rude.

744
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:03,625
I wonder if any of you could help me.

745
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:05,935
I'm looking for a Mr. Hob.

746
01:18:05,936 --> 01:18:07,629
So...

747
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:09,729
...how much you need?

748
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,967
Money, I mean.

749
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:15,279
Well, our current debt to OCP is...

750
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:20,450
...$37,480,911 dollars.

751
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:23,062
Guess you're in some pretty deep shit.

752
01:18:23,162 --> 01:18:25,355
We need all the help we can get,
young man.

753
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:28,734
Tell you what. Put me down for 50,
just to make sure.

754
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:33,339
50 cents, 50 dollars. That's cute.
- Don't be a queer.

755
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,782
Fifty million.

756
01:18:34,882 --> 01:18:38,197
This is bullshit.
Let's get out of here.

757
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:04,659
Good God.

758
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:13,028
Gentlemen?

759
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,128
Well, will 50 do it?

760
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:20,427
Oh, yes. That'll do it.

761
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:23,038
Don't you guys think that'll do it?
- Yeah.

762
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:26,183
Fifty mil. That will do it.

763
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:29,211
That'll do it.
- These people are criminals!

764
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:30,754
Why do you have to label people?

765
01:19:30,854 --> 01:19:33,234
I hate labels!
- You shut up.

766
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:02,870
We cannot capitulate in the war on crime.

767
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:06,457
I'd be voted out of office.
I don't think anyone wants that.

768
01:20:06,557 --> 01:20:09,022
War on crime is fine with us.

769
01:20:09,101 --> 01:20:11,545
It's business we're talking about here.

770
01:20:11,645 --> 01:20:14,048
Do you have any idea
how many people we employ?

771
01:20:14,148 --> 01:20:17,693
No. I never thought about it like that.

772
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:19,094
Sharp kid.

773
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:21,013
So...

774
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:22,723
...your war on crime...

775
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:25,373
...you want to win it or what?

776
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:28,044
We're the only chance you have.

777
01:20:28,162 --> 01:20:30,022
Listen to him.

778
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:32,417
He's got it all worked out.

779
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,670
Why do people do crimes?

780
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:45,287
Why? Drugs. People do drugs.
- Because they want drugs.

781
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:47,806
The kind that cost too much.

782
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:51,335
Nuke gives high quality at a cheap price.

783
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:53,837
If you get off our backs,
we'll make it cheaper.

784
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:55,047
And safer.

785
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:57,633
We don't shove our shit
down anybody's throat.

786
01:20:57,733 --> 01:21:01,387
And we don't advertise it
like they do with cigarettes or booze.

787
01:21:01,487 --> 01:21:03,487
So leave us alone...

788
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,590
...and anybody who wants it gets it.

789
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:10,729
So no more crimes.

790
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:14,739
You get to be the mayor
who cleaned up Detroit.

791
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:23,924
He's got a point.

792
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:26,662
Don't you think he's got a point?

793
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:28,847
Yeah, he's got a point.

794
01:21:34,269 --> 01:21:36,269
What the hell is that?

795
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,280
Get out!

796
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:54,141
Marv, are...?

797
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:35,949
Cain.

798
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:38,201
Oh, wow.

799
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:43,498
You look great.

800
01:25:41,892 --> 01:25:44,895
It'll take some getting used to...

801
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:49,775
...but it'll be great, Cain.

802
01:28:51,582 --> 01:28:53,582
Lie still.

803
01:28:58,297 --> 01:29:02,050
I'm cold.
- You are going into shock.

804
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:05,204
I will call for a medical emergency unit.

805
01:29:05,304 --> 01:29:07,681
Wait. No.

806
01:29:09,433 --> 01:29:11,433
Don't leave me.

807
01:29:13,979 --> 01:29:16,064
I won't leave you.

808
01:29:21,111 --> 01:29:23,111
Who did this?

809
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:25,113
It was big.

810
01:29:25,491 --> 01:29:27,910
Bigger than you.

811
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:30,368
It was Cain.

812
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:33,957
I'm gonna die.

813
01:29:36,293 --> 01:29:39,438
You know what that's like, don't you?

814
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:42,591
It really sucks.

815
01:29:48,806 --> 01:29:50,806
Yes.

816
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:15,357
Thirteen dead in what appears
to be a Nuke money massacre.

817
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:18,687
Among the victims,
two city councilmen.

818
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:21,989
Was the city trying to strike a deal
with the drug lords?

819
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:25,300
No comment!
I said, I have no comment!

820
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:27,411
No comments on these allegations.

821
01:30:27,511 --> 01:30:30,581
These were men
who served this city tirelessly.

822
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:35,002
However, I make a promise
to the people of Detroit City...

823
01:30:35,102 --> 01:30:38,422
...that no effort will be spared
to investigate this thoroughly!

824
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:40,424
But, Mr. Mayor, what about...?

825
01:30:40,524 --> 01:30:43,110
I'm sorry. No more questions.

826
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:45,320
Our own Mayor Kuzak.

827
01:30:45,445 --> 01:30:47,222
Now let's go live to Jess.

828
01:30:47,322 --> 01:30:52,436
And here it is, the Civic Centrum, OCP's
100-story gift to the Motor City.

829
01:30:52,536 --> 01:30:55,647
While debate continues
over OCP's hostile takeover...

830
01:30:55,747 --> 01:30:58,400
...there's no denying
the mood down here is festive.

831
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:02,112
Citizens interviewed on the scene
expressed excitement and hope...

832
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:06,492
...that OCP will make good on its
promise of a better life in Detroit.

833
01:31:06,592 --> 01:31:08,660
Press!
- Sorry, folks, media only.

834
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,415
TV and press only.
You'll have to step back.

835
01:31:19,771 --> 01:31:21,771
There he is!

836
01:31:27,446 --> 01:31:29,681
Can OCP bring industry back to Detroit?

837
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:32,476
Does OCP own the city?
Will you hold elections?

838
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:35,938
Do we become OCP employees?
- Why not go to City Hall?

839
01:31:36,038 --> 01:31:38,038
Just a minute.

840
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:40,025
I'll answer that, young lady.

841
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:44,822
City Hall is the decaying symbol
of mismanagement and corruption.

842
01:31:44,922 --> 01:31:46,198
You get that?

843
01:31:46,298 --> 01:31:50,327
This magnificent structure will be the seat
of leadership for the new Detroit.

844
01:31:50,427 --> 01:31:53,789
And what better place
for a clean, fresh start?

845
01:31:53,889 --> 01:31:57,059
And so, people of the press...

846
01:31:57,142 --> 01:31:58,919
...city officials...

847
01:31:59,019 --> 01:32:02,339
...in a few minutes
Omni Consumer Products...

848
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:05,300
...and the troubled city of Detroit...

849
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:09,363
...will join in a bold new venture.

850
01:32:09,404 --> 01:32:11,614
Now I'd like to explain...

851
01:32:11,615 --> 01:32:13,600
...just what this will mean.

852
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,437
Sometimes we just have to start over...

853
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:17,980
...from scratch...

854
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,120
...to make things right.

855
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:23,944
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

856
01:32:24,044 --> 01:32:26,613
We're going to build a brand-new city...

857
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:29,093
...where Detroit now stands.

858
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:31,218
An example...

859
01:32:31,343 --> 01:32:33,343
...to the world.

860
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:55,225
My friends...

861
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:58,704
...welcome to our city as it should be.

862
01:32:58,787 --> 01:33:02,733
And as it will be,
in the hands of responsible...

863
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:05,127
...private enterprise.

864
01:33:06,211 --> 01:33:08,297
And a special welcome...

865
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:11,825
...to Mayor Kuzak
and the outgoing administration.

866
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:14,050
We're not going anywhere.

867
01:33:14,553 --> 01:33:16,553
Your Honor.

868
01:33:18,223 --> 01:33:21,418
You'll have to tear down a lot
of houses to make that.

869
01:33:21,518 --> 01:33:23,337
I mean, take away their homes!

870
01:33:23,437 --> 01:33:26,590
We're going to raise towers
of glass and steel.

871
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:30,552
Every citizen will have a living unit,
safe, secure, and clean.

872
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:32,221
Now, please take your seat.

873
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:34,556
Won't be much room for neighborhoods.

874
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:36,934
Not like the kind we all grew up in.

875
01:33:37,034 --> 01:33:40,104
Today neighborhoods are places
where bad things happen.

876
01:33:40,204 --> 01:33:41,522
Don't be nostalgic.

877
01:33:41,622 --> 01:33:44,817
What about democracy?
Nobody elected you.

878
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:47,377
Anyone can buy OCP stock...

879
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:50,130
...and own a piece of our city.

880
01:33:51,006 --> 01:33:53,367
What could be more democratic than that?

881
01:33:53,467 --> 01:33:58,038
There's a lot of people in this town
that can't afford to buy your stock!

882
01:33:58,138 --> 01:34:00,582
And they won't let you get away with this.

883
01:34:00,682 --> 01:34:03,827
You haven't been following the polls.

884
01:34:04,436 --> 01:34:06,436
Sit down.

885
01:34:07,231 --> 01:34:10,317
Sit down, mayor.

886
01:34:13,654 --> 01:34:16,348
About a year ago we gave this city Robocop.

887
01:34:16,448 --> 01:34:18,851
I think he's worked out pretty well.

888
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:21,353
But things have become rougher out there.

889
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:24,481
And now we need a law enforcement unit...

890
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:26,942
...able to meet the enemy
on his own ground...

891
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:30,017
...and carrying enough firepower...

892
01:34:30,045 --> 01:34:32,548
...to get the job done.

893
01:34:37,219 --> 01:34:39,346
Ladies and gentlemen...

894
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:41,457
...with great pleasure...

895
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:43,125
...I give you...

896
01:34:43,225 --> 01:34:45,477
...Robocop 2.

897
01:34:54,444 --> 01:34:57,473
Those bastards are maniacs!
- What's the matter?

898
01:34:57,573 --> 01:35:00,601
I can't believe it.
It was them! They sent it!

899
01:35:00,701 --> 01:35:02,561
Sent what?

900
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:03,979
Nothing.

901
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:06,565
There going to be a big call for this unit.

902
01:35:06,665 --> 01:35:08,942
And we'll make him right here in Detroit.

903
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:12,071
That means jobs we can all be proud of.

904
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:14,406
And make 'Made in America'...

905
01:35:14,506 --> 01:35:16,925
...mean something again.

906
01:35:19,845 --> 01:35:22,014
This single container...

907
01:35:22,097 --> 01:35:25,752
...holds enough Nuke
to addict a city block.

908
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:28,587
A hundred of these
are produced every day...

909
01:35:28,687 --> 01:35:30,214
...and sent to sweatshops...

910
01:35:30,314 --> 01:35:33,342
...where urban slaves
prepare this poison...

911
01:35:33,442 --> 01:35:36,595
...for our friends, our loved ones,
our children.

912
01:35:36,695 --> 01:35:38,347
Now, I say...

913
01:35:38,447 --> 01:35:41,809
...it's high time
we put an end to this plague.

914
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:46,163
Robocop 2 will seek out every laboratory...

915
01:35:46,205 --> 01:35:49,690
...every dealer,
and rid our city of Nuke.

916
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:55,072
Yes.

917
01:35:55,172 --> 01:35:59,337
Things will be a lot quieter
with this boy around.

918
01:36:14,024 --> 01:36:16,427
What's wrong with him?
- It's nothing.

919
01:36:16,527 --> 01:36:19,154
Nothing at all.
- Turn him off.

920
01:36:20,155 --> 01:36:21,473
I can't.

921
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:23,951
Cain! Let's step outside.

922
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:29,765
You! Get out of here!
You're obsolete!

923
01:36:29,832 --> 01:36:31,442
That thing is a killer!

924
01:36:31,542 --> 01:36:37,067
It's not even armed! It's harmless!
- It's a killer, and I saw it!

925
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:54,416
Take her out of here! Now!
- Let me go!

926
01:37:14,751 --> 01:37:17,337
Behave yourselves!

927
01:38:04,802 --> 01:38:10,242
What's the deal here?
- Christ knows. Sounds like a war in there.

928
01:39:22,588 --> 01:39:25,549
You're coming with me, Cain.

929
01:41:24,293 --> 01:41:26,293
There he is!

930
01:41:37,473 --> 01:41:42,318
All right, get back!
- Are you jealous of the replacement?

931
01:42:31,568 --> 01:42:34,713
This could look bad for OCP, Johnson.

932
01:42:34,988 --> 01:42:38,048
Scramble the best spin team we have.

933
01:43:47,478 --> 01:43:50,022
Ammo! Ammo!

934
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:12,083
Get down!

935
01:44:33,357 --> 01:44:35,092
Hold your fire!

936
01:44:35,192 --> 01:44:37,861
Hold your fire, damn it!

937
01:44:59,967 --> 01:45:02,177
Let's get him out of here.

938
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:07,182
Watch his neck. He's hurt bad. Easy.

939
01:45:13,438 --> 01:45:15,438
Shit!

940
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,509
I gotta get back.

941
01:45:17,609 --> 01:45:19,904
Move it back! Move it back!

942
01:45:34,835 --> 01:45:37,337
Let's give him what he wants.

943
01:47:37,499 --> 01:47:39,499
Goodbye.

944
01:48:11,492 --> 01:48:13,936
It's serious trouble.
So many dead and wounded.

945
01:48:14,036 --> 01:48:16,105
There won't be trouble from the dead.

946
01:48:16,205 --> 01:48:18,482
They'll have relatives. They always do.

947
01:48:18,582 --> 01:48:21,652
It'll be a feeding frenzy.
- It's only money.

948
01:48:21,752 --> 01:48:23,904
What about criminal proceedings?
- Well...

949
01:48:24,004 --> 01:48:27,908
...we're looking at major indictments, sir.
Prison terms.

950
01:48:28,008 --> 01:48:30,744
What about me?
- You know we'll do whatever we can.

951
01:48:30,844 --> 01:48:32,788
That's not good enough.
- Sir?

952
01:48:32,888 --> 01:48:35,207
What if this was the work
of one individual?

953
01:48:35,307 --> 01:48:39,336
A person who had her own agenda, wasn't
in sync with the goals of our company?

954
01:48:39,436 --> 01:48:42,272
Well, that usually works.

955
01:48:42,689 --> 01:48:45,217
A woman who was not a team player.

956
01:48:45,317 --> 01:48:48,028
Who violated our trust.

957
01:48:49,112 --> 01:48:51,448
Easy, easy.

958
01:48:51,865 --> 01:48:53,475
Well...

959
01:48:53,575 --> 01:48:56,061
...we'd need some evidence to support that.

960
01:48:56,161 --> 01:48:59,023
Sir, whether it exists or not,
I know I can find it.

961
01:48:59,123 --> 01:49:02,251
She did choose the brain, sir.

962
01:49:03,627 --> 01:49:05,963
Good thinking.
- Sir.

963
01:49:06,088 --> 01:49:08,383
Thank God you're all right.

964
01:49:08,423 --> 01:49:11,827
I was worried. I thought
it was going to hurt you.

965
01:49:11,927 --> 01:49:14,054
It's over. It's all over.

966
01:49:15,347 --> 01:49:16,957
I failed you.

967
01:49:17,057 --> 01:49:22,242
Don't be hard on yourself.
Everything's going to be all right.

968
01:49:23,564 --> 01:49:27,818
Johnson, that business
we were talking about.

969
01:49:27,818 --> 01:49:29,820
Get right on it.

970
01:49:33,949 --> 01:49:35,949
Yes, sir.

971
01:49:39,997 --> 01:49:43,108
Just look at what they've done.
They are criminals.

972
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:46,070
OCP won't own this city for long.
And I'll see to that.

973
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:48,655
I'll take it to the streets and the people.

974
01:49:48,755 --> 01:49:50,240
What has it come to?

975
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:53,077
Businessmen can buy our rights like stock?

976
01:49:53,177 --> 01:49:56,237
You don't realize what we're losing!

977
01:49:57,139 --> 01:49:59,416
Right here, sir!
- Give us a statement!

978
01:49:59,516 --> 01:50:03,337
Dozens are dead.
Is this your idea of a better life?

979
01:50:03,437 --> 01:50:07,383
Was this an experiment of some kind?
- He was crazy. How did it happen?

980
01:50:07,483 --> 01:50:11,470
Did you build it to take control?
- How do you account for this disaster?

981
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:15,055
Will OCP make reparations to the victims?

982
01:50:15,532 --> 01:50:18,060
That son of a bitch
is getting away with it.

983
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:20,200
We can't even touch him.

984
01:50:21,538 --> 01:50:23,538
Patience, Lewis.

985
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:26,875
We're only human.
