1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:32,145
<i>Last night, the FAA was forced to ground
all aircraft, leaving thousands stranded...</i>

3
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,148
<i>... when electronic failures
and mysterious power outages...</i>

4
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,152
<i>... crippled the western United States.
But the big story today...</i>

5
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,197
<i>... the much-anticipated wedding
of fantastic couple...</i>

6
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:46,910
<i>... Reed Richards and Susan Storm
will take place this Saturday.</i>

7
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,582
Unbelievable. Bizarre anomalies...

8
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:56,086
...are occurring all over the world,
defying every law of physics...

9
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:59,798
...and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked.

10
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:04,761
What did you pick? The blue ones
with them little flowers? I like them.

11
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:06,596
Excuse me, would you mind?

12
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:09,850
- It's happening again, isn't it?
- Yeah, sure.

13
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:13,353
No. We're not postponing
anything, not this time.

14
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,858
This will be the wedding you dreamed of.
I won't let anything get in the way.

15
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,196
Not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level.

16
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,451
That's the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

17
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,620
Which is really pathetic,
when you think about it.

18
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:34,124
Dr. Richards, I'm very sorry,
but we're overbooked.

19
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,794
- We do have seats available in coach.
- Okay, here we go.

20
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,338
- Smile!
- Awesome!

21
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:40,964
Look, Mom!

22
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:43,967
- Let me get one more.
- That should be fine.

23
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:49,723
That's my seat.

24
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,476
Sorry.

25
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,407
Excuse me.

26
00:05:18,502 --> 00:05:22,339
What if we get an endorsement
from an airline? Get us a private jet?

27
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:25,258
I think we have enough
endorsement deals.

28
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:31,306
That's funny. Seriously, Reed, it could
help subsidize your little inventions.

29
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:33,809
- No, thanks.
- Excuse me.

30
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,937
- Consider it. Talk to you later.
- Where are you going?

31
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,106
I don't fly coach.

32
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:58,667
I hope it rains.

33
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,294
<i>The snowfall came with no warning...</i>

34
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,172
<i>... and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow.</i>

35
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:07,175
<i>In Japan, some suggest
the solidification of the bay...</i>

36
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:09,720
<i>... was due to underwater
volcanic activity...</i>

37
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:12,597
...though no such activity
has been reported in the area.

38
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,017
<i>Scientists have ruled out
global warming...</i>

39
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:19,354
<i>... as the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe.</i>

40
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:22,357
<i>With scientists unable
to explain the events...</i>

41
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:25,861
<i>... some are wondering
if the hand of God is at work.</i>

42
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:29,531
<i>In other news, Reed Richards
and Susan Storm 's wedding...</i>

43
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,408
<i>... has Manhattan all abuzz.</i>

44
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:35,329
<i>The guest list includes
many of New York's power elite.</i>

45
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:38,332
Hey, honey.

46
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:42,085
The city's charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed...

47
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:46,465
...during that armored-car robbery.
I only remember two cars getting thrown.

48
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,260
Reed.

49
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:54,765
All right. I'm putting it away.

50
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,475
You were saying?

51
00:06:56,642 --> 00:07:00,020
I have a fitting in half an hour.
The musicians after that.

52
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:04,858
I haven't picked out the place settings
or the flowers. There's too much to do.

53
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,071
Don't worry about it. Between
the two of us, we'll get it all done.

54
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,490
And what were you doing
when I walked in?

55
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:14,409
- Inputting my to-do list.
- Really?

56
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:16,995
- Scout's honor.
- Hey, guys.

57
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:19,790
New uniforms showed up.
What do you think?

58
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,379
I think there's no way
we're wearing that.

59
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,465
What do you have against capitalism?

60
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:32,427
What's this?

61
00:07:32,594 --> 00:07:34,596
- Just a little hobby of mine.
- Yeah?

62
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:38,642
Would it make a good toy,
or is it something science-y?

63
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,477
A little of both.

64
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:46,900
I'm both impressed
and disgusted at that.

65
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:49,236
Yeah. Sue says I'm addicted to it.

66
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:51,238
I wonder why she'd say that.

67
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,824
Hey, Johnny.

68
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:59,913
Keep it quiet, but I've cross-referenced
and analyzed the global disturbances.

69
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:04,418
They're caused by cosmic radiation, not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers.

70
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,462
Wow, that's really boring.

71
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:11,717
Listen, I have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about.

72
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:13,844
Yeah, of course.

73
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,138
Your bachelor party.

74
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:18,807
No. Seriously, Johnny.

75
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:23,020
John. Focus-testing showed Johnny
skewed a little young.

76
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:27,899
Seriously, Johnny, no bachelor party.
It's just not my kind of thing.

77
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:33,739
Then do it for Ben. It means a lot
to the big guy. You'll break his heart.

78
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,907
He does have some
sort of rocklike heart.

79
00:08:36,074 --> 00:08:38,035
I have too much to do
before the wedding.

80
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:41,455
I think Sue might have
a problem with it.

81
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,207
You know what Sue
would have a problem with?

82
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:47,044
If somebody told her
you were investigating...

83
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,504
...global disturbances
and cosmic radiation...

84
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:55,677
...instead of focusing on the wedding,
like you promised.

85
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,689
- A bachelor party could be fun.
- Yes!

86
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:09,858
But no exotic dancers.

87
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:59,324
- This is it?
- I don't know anybody here.

88
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:02,369
I would have invited your friends,
but you don't have any.

89
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,371
Hey!

90
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,373
Johnny, we had a deal.

91
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:10,252
They're not exotic dancers.

92
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,254
They're just hot.

93
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:19,720
You're Mr. Fantastic, aren't you?
That's so awesome.

94
00:10:23,348 --> 00:10:24,891
Wow, you're really cute.

95
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,312
I'll need a pitcher with
the biggest handle you've got.

96
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:30,063
No problem.

97
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:48,415
Good evening,
and welcome to the Baxter...

98
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:54,171
Could I help you?
No, you can't use that elev...

99
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:02,346
Ms. Storm will be with your shortly.

100
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:06,850
Hello?

101
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,477
Thanks, Roberta.

102
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,773
May I help you?

103
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:16,985
- We're here to see Dr. Richards.
- He's not here. Can I help you?

104
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:20,280
Yes. You can take me
to see Dr. Richards.

105
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,200
Okay.

106
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,168
Sorry.

107
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:39,549
When the universe began, it was
no bigger than a marble. Then, bang!

108
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:42,427
It exploded.
And in a trillionth of a second...

109
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:45,806
...it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know.

110
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,351
Wow, you're really smart.

111
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:51,812
Thanks, Candy.
That means a lot to me.

112
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:55,148
I love this song. Wanna dance?

113
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:56,733
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

114
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,819
- Honestly.
- Come on, you'll be great.

115
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,613
I don't want to embarrass you guys.

116
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,002
Just loosen up. Have some fun.

117
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:17,421
That's it.

118
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,464
Yeah.

119
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:23,260
That's it.

120
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:35,480
- Guy really knows how to loosen up.
- You're not kidding.

121
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,423
There he is.

122
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,050
Yes.

123
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:05,135
Unfortunately.

124
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:12,517
For him.

125
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:17,606
Shall we?

126
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:25,572
I think it might be clobbering time.

127
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,991
Sue. What are you...?

128
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,246
General Hager.

129
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:35,290
Let's talk somewhere private.

130
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,002
Unless you need to do Jell-O shots
off someone's stomach.

131
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:43,590
I was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to...

132
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:48,261
This was Johnny's idea.
I just went along.

133
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,516
How does Reed know the general?

134
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:55,978
A few years back, the guy was pushing
a new missile-defense system.

135
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:58,981
Reed testified that the
technology wouldn't work.

136
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:01,858
I'm here on direct orders from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

137
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:06,279
Personally, I don't like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian.

138
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,866
Especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much.

139
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:12,911
Always a pleasure
to see you too, general.

140
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,539
What can I do for you?

141
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:18,750
As you may know, there've
been unusual occurrences.

142
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:23,088
<i>Officially, we've downplayed their
significance, but we're concerned...</i>

143
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:28,176
...these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security.

144
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:31,722
These were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago.

145
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:37,978
- What is it?
- We hoped Dr. Richards could tell us.

146
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:42,316
I'm afraid I've never
seen anything like it. Ben?

147
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:47,988
I would say that it was a meteor,
but the trail's all wrong.

148
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:49,865
It's giving off its own energy.

149
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:51,867
Take a look at this.

150
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:56,204
These have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world.

151
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:59,666
Field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters.

152
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:05,505
To find out what this is about, we need
a way to locate and intercept that object.

153
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,634
A sensor could be tied into
the Baxter Building's satellite grid.

154
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:12,346
We can pinpoint the location
of the object.

155
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:17,017
- Good. You'll build the sensor for us...
- I'm afraid I can't.

156
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:20,354
What?

157
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:24,983
I'm getting married this Saturday.
I just don't have the time.

158
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:30,781
Richards, your country
needs your help.

159
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,326
Call Professor Jeff Wagner.

160
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:37,412
He's head of the
Physics Department at Brown.

161
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:39,164
I expected more, Richards.

162
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,459
Even from you.

163
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:59,601
John Storm,
Fantastic Four Incorporated.

164
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:02,062
- Ever done any modeling?
- Not interested.

165
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:05,565
- You got an amazing complexion.
- Not interested.

166
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:11,738
Wow, and you just walked away.

167
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,241
I was definitely still talking.

168
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:18,161
I can't believe you just turned down
a science project.

169
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:21,915
They can build a sensor without me.

170
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,668
The most important thing right now
is our wedding.

171
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:26,795
No postponements. No interruptions.

172
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:28,505
Thank you.

173
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:31,883
And, look, about what you saw
back at the bar...

174
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,054
Don't worry about it. I know you.

175
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,974
I'm glad you had fun.

176
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:41,226
Thank you.

177
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:43,478
Besides...

178
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:47,983
...it was nothing compared to what
I did at my bachelorette party.

179
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:51,361
Talk about wild.

180
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:54,239
Wild?

181
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,209
Come on.

182
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:39,826
Hey, what are you doing up here?

183
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,664
Nothing. Just needed some air.

184
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:47,376
You're making that thing
for the general, aren't you?

185
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:50,462
I'm guessing Susie
doesn't know anything about it.

186
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:52,756
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

187
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:55,968
That is, they would be if I had any.

188
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,929
Look, don't tell Johnny.

189
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:03,850
- Don't tell Johnny what?
- Great.

190
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,311
- Are you building that thing?
- No.

191
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:09,564
If Sue finds out, you'll get
an invisible kick in the nuts.

192
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:12,567
- Hey, hey. We're keeping this quiet.
- I know.

193
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:14,111
Don't worry.

194
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:19,116
It's the wedding of the century.
Reed Richards and Susan Storm...

195
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:21,576
<i>... Mr. Fantastic
and the Invisible Woman...</i>

196
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:26,665
<i>... will try again to tie the knot today
in a ceremony in New York.</i>

197
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:40,971
- Look at these parasites.
- I know, it's unbelievable.

198
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:42,639
Have they no shame?

199
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,395
Hey! Hey, listen! Listen, everybody!

200
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:52,691
This is a very special day for my sister,
probably the most important of her life.

201
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:56,778
So I just want to say to you guys,
please respect our privacy.

202
00:18:56,945 --> 00:18:59,031
Come on, Johnny.

203
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:02,659
Just kidding. We're auctioning off
the exclusive wedding photos...

204
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:07,164
...to the highest bidder, so go online
and place your bids. Thank you.

205
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:08,623
Johnny, are you planning...?

206
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:11,460
So, what's it take to date
the Human Torch?

207
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:15,881
- Fireproof lingerie and a lot of aloe.
- Thank you.

208
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:32,481
- Are you all right?
- How are you?

209
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:37,736
Invitation, sir?

210
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,655
I should be on that list.

211
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:41,657
- Name?
- Stan Lee.

212
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:43,283
Yeah, nice try, buddy.

213
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,535
- No, really. I'm Stan Lee.
- Nice try.

214
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:51,583
This isn't how I imagined it.

215
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:54,044
It never is.

216
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:58,924
No, Alicia, it just doesn't feel right.

217
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:02,260
Sweetie...

218
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,640
...I think even superheroes are allowed
to have wedding-day jitters.

219
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:11,561
It's more than that.
Is my life always gonna be a circus?

220
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:14,898
Do we really want to raise kids
in all this?

221
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:18,068
Face it, we're not exactly normal.

222
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,363
<i>Ben and I aren't normal...</i>

223
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,616
<i>... but we don't let it
get in the way of us being happy.</i>

224
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:27,786
Do you love Reed?

225
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,331
More than I've ever loved anyone.

226
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,836
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

227
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,257
Thank you.

228
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:51,143
Okay.

229
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,937
- Oh, great.
- What?

230
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:55,314
I've got a zit.

231
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,775
- Can't you put makeup on it?
- No, no, I got it.

232
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:01,028
Crisis averted.

233
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:05,115
Now all I have to do is concentrate
on the area for the next eight hours.

234
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:12,581
Reed, come on. You're gonna miss
your own wedding.

235
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:14,583
Just a minute.

236
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:17,377
Almost done.

237
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:24,635
General, I'm putting
the sensor online now.

238
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:35,479
There. If there's a surge in cosmic
radiation anywhere, you'll know.

239
00:21:35,646 --> 00:21:38,815
<i>Let's hope so. We've gotten
reports of two more craters.</i>

240
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:40,692
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

241
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,320
All right. Just linking it to my PDA.

242
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:46,698
- Reed.
- And that's it.

243
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:49,951
Good, that's great.
Now shave and put on your tux.

244
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:52,579
You're getting married
and you look like a bum.

245
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,748
Absolutely.

246
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,918
What?

247
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:02,464
I'm getting married.

248
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:09,304
Oh, jeez.

249
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:12,557
I'm getting married.

250
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:16,979
I heard of getting cold feet...

251
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,819
Okay.

252
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:26,071
Hey, Johnny.

253
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:31,493
Does that amaze anyone else?
How did she know it was me?

254
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,830
To be honest,
you kind of smell like ash.

255
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:37,916
- You're late.
- Let's not make today about me.

256
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,668
It's Reed and Sue's big day.

257
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:42,504
Let's give them the attention
for a change.

258
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:44,923
Don't do that.

259
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:47,592
- Okay, you're perfect.
- You're perfect.

260
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:54,808
I'll see you upstairs.

261
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:57,311
Bye, Johnny.

262
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,066
So seems like you and Alicia are
doing well. Annoyingly so, in fact.

263
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,402
Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

264
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:07,404
Yeah, you are.

265
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:10,032
Question for you, though:

266
00:23:10,198 --> 00:23:11,950
How do you guys...?

267
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:18,290
- None of your business!
- Okay, I'm just concerned.

268
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,793
I'd hate to find out
she was killed in a rock slide.

269
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:24,046
I'll show you a rock slide!

270
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,360
What are you?

271
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:57,871
Thank you.

272
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,625
Johnny?

273
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:04,252
You shouldn't tease him so much.

274
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:06,046
It was a joke.

275
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:10,175
I don't know, I think it bothers you
to see him really happy and in love.

276
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:12,469
I think you're jealous.

277
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:16,431
You think I'm jealous?
Have you seen the women I've dated?

278
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:18,350
No.

279
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:24,314
You can only fool yourself
but for so long, Torch.

280
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,777
Hey. It's the bride of stretchy man.

281
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:31,780
- Don't start.
- Don't listen to him. You look gorgeous.

282
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:33,615
We'll see you out there, sweetie.

283
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:37,119
- Come on. We're on.
- Okay. Okay.

284
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:43,625
You don't look completely
ridiculous in that dress.

285
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:48,505
Is that obnoxious-brother talk
for "You look kind of nice"?

286
00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:51,091
You look beautiful.

287
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:55,220
Thank you.

288
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:12,446
Dad would be proud.

289
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,783
Yeah.

290
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:43,685
Reed, shut your cell phone off.

291
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:46,104
Actually, this is a...

292
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:29,398
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to...

293
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,820
Sue and Reed,
congratulations on your wedding!

294
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:38,949
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

295
00:26:39,116 --> 00:26:43,286
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today to join this couple...

296
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:46,123
...Reed Richards and Susan Storm,
together...

297
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:52,879
...in the bond of holy...

298
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:57,175
...matrimony.

299
00:26:57,342 --> 00:26:59,594
I can't believe you
brought that to our wedding.

300
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:01,722
I know, but there's a good reason.

301
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:04,474
- We have to do this quickly.
- That's romantic.

302
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:08,603
- Should I continue?
- Yes, please.

303
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:13,483
- There are many kinds of love.
- Could you skip to the end, please?

304
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,652
- Reed.
- Excuse me?

305
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:26,413
- What happened?
- What's going on?

306
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:42,554
We've lost power!
We're going down! We're going down!

307
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:45,140
It's too late.

308
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:55,108
- Pull up!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

309
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,503
Ben!

310
00:28:27,516 --> 00:28:29,851
- Johnny.
- This is Dolce.

311
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:35,899
Flame on!

312
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:53,041
Man, he's fast.

313
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,014
That is cool.

314
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:20,986
- Hey, taxi!
- Oh, man!

315
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:37,878
Showoff.

316
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:10,452
Time to end this.

317
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:15,582
Can we talk?

318
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:28,303
Okay, you win.

319
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,773
Flame on! Come on!

320
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,025
Flame on!

321
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,425
Hey.

322
00:31:18,603 --> 00:31:21,315
Your herald summons you.

323
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:24,276
Another world awaits.

324
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:27,112
Let it be done quickly.

325
00:31:32,284 --> 00:31:37,414
It looked like a man, but completely
covered in silver, and it flew this, like...

326
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:40,250
...surfboard-type thing.
I know that sounds crazy.

327
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,419
Oh, no, not at all.

328
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:46,506
Did you follow the shiny man to
Lollipop Land or the Rainbow Junction?

329
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:50,093
- I know what I saw.
- Thank you. It's all right, Johnny.

330
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:54,931
Whatever this thing is, it has the ability
to convert matter and energy.

331
00:31:55,098 --> 00:31:56,933
So it caused the anomalies?

332
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,020
It seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself...

333
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:04,608
...randomly affecting matter.
Evidently, this entity, this...

334
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:08,612
...Silver Surfer...

335
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:12,699
...didn't want to be detected.
It destroyed the sensor.

336
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:16,161
- It knew it was being monitored?
- And traced it back here.

337
00:32:16,328 --> 00:32:19,247
We're dealing with something
highly resourceful.

338
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:23,502
Are you feeling okay?

339
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:26,546
Yeah. I just... I gotta walk this off.

340
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:33,011
We must destroy it
before it attacks again.

341
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:36,515
Richards, find me
another way to track it.

342
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:44,898
Sue, I am so sorry.

343
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:48,443
I didn't tell you, because I
didn't want you to worry.

344
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,488
I'm not mad you built the sensor.
You did the right thing.

345
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:52,906
Oh, great.

346
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:58,453
I wasn't finished.

347
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,583
Okay. Sorry. Please continue.

348
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,044
This proves what I've been saying.

349
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:08,046
Could you drop the force field?

350
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:10,590
We can't even... Sorry.

351
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:13,552
Even our wedding
turns into World War III.

352
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:17,806
I know. But once we are married,
everything will be back to normal.

353
00:33:17,973 --> 00:33:21,893
We will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do.

354
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,896
How could we possibly
raise a family like this?

355
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:31,486
I'm gonna go check on Johnny.

356
00:33:44,374 --> 00:33:46,376
Johnny?

357
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:55,427
Hey, are you all right, pal?

358
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:58,221
Are you all right?

359
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:02,517
Johnny?

360
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:05,312
Johnny, are you okay?

361
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:09,983
I don't know. I've been feeling really
strange since my run-in with surfer boy.

362
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,778
Maybe we should get you checked out.

363
00:34:14,196 --> 00:34:16,490
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't do anything!

364
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,659
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!

365
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:22,788
Oh, my God, Sue! Just...

366
00:34:22,954 --> 00:34:25,332
Just hang on! I'll get you, okay?

367
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,918
Flame on!

368
00:34:29,503 --> 00:34:31,421
Hey, watch it.

369
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,843
Reed!

370
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,304
Reed! Reed!

371
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:41,181
- Help!
- Sue?

372
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:42,891
I'm on fire!

373
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:46,228
- Sue! What's going on?
- I'm on fire!

374
00:34:46,395 --> 00:34:48,397
- You're on fire!
- You think?

375
00:34:48,563 --> 00:34:51,066
- Hold on!
- Pull me in!

376
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:55,779
Hey, it's the Human Torch!

377
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:57,364
Johnny!

378
00:34:57,572 --> 00:34:59,950
- I'm not Johnny!
- Sue, how did this happen?

379
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:02,911
I touched Johnny, and then this.

380
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:05,497
- Where is Johnny?
- Here.

381
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:07,791
Try it again.

382
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:14,006
- Nice.
- There you go.

383
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:16,341
Hey, get out of there.

384
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:17,634
Sue, your clothes.

385
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:22,931
Why does this always happen to me?

386
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,684
All of Sue's results are normal.

387
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:27,602
<i>But Johnny's...</i>

388
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:28,979
Johnny's are what?

389
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:34,693
Your encounter with the Surfer put your
molecules in a constant state of flux.

390
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:39,072
Is that bad?

391
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:42,909
It caused you to temporarily
switch powers with Sue.

392
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:45,704
- I'd like to run more tests and...
- Want a volunteer?

393
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:47,247
- No, no, hey!
- No, no, no!

394
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:50,125
No, no, hey! This is serious!

395
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:51,877
I just wanted to give him a hug.

396
00:35:52,044 --> 00:35:54,254
We don't know the extent
of his condition.

397
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:56,048
It could be progressive.

398
00:35:56,214 --> 00:35:58,133
- It could be fun.
- No, Ben!

399
00:35:58,342 --> 00:35:59,968
Ben!

400
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:03,847
Hey. Hey, it's me! I'm back!

401
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,775
Oh, my God!

402
00:36:15,776 --> 00:36:18,320
Come on!
We just said this is serious!

403
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:19,988
Oh, yeah, serious.

404
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:24,117
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

405
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:29,581
- Hey, not bad.
- Incredible.

406
00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:32,334
- You better be able to fix this!
- I'm right on it.

407
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:36,546
- Ben, stop it!
- I see why you like that.

408
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,549
Oh, no, no, no.

409
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:43,512
Crap.

410
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,848
That's not funny. What am I
supposed to do in the meantime?

411
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:49,685
Just try to keep
your distance from us.

412
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:56,525
You and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together, pal!

413
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:09,162
<i>My inside sources tell me
unlucky bride-to-be Sue Storm...</i>

414
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:12,124
<i>... turned invisible
and is staying that way...</i>

415
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,085
<i>... after yesterday's
embarrassing fiasco.</i>

416
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:19,006
<i>Next, the Invisible Woman 's
greatest fashion blunders...</i>

417
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:22,884
<i>... and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist Reed Richards.</i>

418
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:27,597
Why do you keep watching this?
Just ignore it.

419
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:30,976
I can't ignore it, Reed.
There's no getting away from it!

420
00:37:31,143 --> 00:37:33,270
- I believe there is.
- How?

421
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:37,482
See? No answer.

422
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:42,863
Yes, there is.

423
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,034
What if, after this crisis is over...

424
00:37:47,826 --> 00:37:51,038
...we leave it all behind?
- What are you talking about?

425
00:37:51,204 --> 00:37:53,540
We move out of the Baxter Building.

426
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:56,209
I'll take a teaching position
somewhere.

427
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:58,211
Get back to my research.

428
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:03,050
The two of us will live our lives
and raise a family, like normal people.

429
00:38:03,216 --> 00:38:05,135
You would do that?

430
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:08,138
Nothing is more important to me
than our future together.

431
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:11,892
Oh, thank you.

432
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:20,275
What about Ben and Johnny?

433
00:38:20,442 --> 00:38:21,568
They'll understand.

434
00:38:22,694 --> 00:38:26,323
Besides, Johnny's always
been more of a solo act.

435
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,408
Let's not mention it to them yet.

436
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:33,455
Johnny's got enough to worry about
as it is, with his power problems.

437
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:34,016
You've been busy, my friend.

438
00:39:34,182 --> 00:39:37,060
Your talents are impressive.

439
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:42,149
Can you understand what I'm saying?

440
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:47,571
Together, we could be unstoppable.

441
00:39:48,572 --> 00:39:51,867
Anything would be ours for the taking.

442
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:55,162
All that you know is at an end.

443
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:58,165
What do you mean by that?

444
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:01,251
Wait! I said, wait!

445
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:29,446
They're breaking up the team.
Reed and Sue, I overheard them.

446
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:32,324
They want a nice, normal,
boring-ass life.

447
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:34,618
- No more Fantastic Four.
- Well...

448
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:37,120
...what do we do?
Keep going, just the two of us?

449
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:39,706
And call ourselves what?
The Dynamic Duo?

450
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,960
When were they gonna tell us?

451
00:40:43,126 --> 00:40:45,504
They'll tell you when they're ready.

452
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:47,506
It's their decision, not yours.

453
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:50,759
You can't be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy.

454
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:53,762
Guys.

455
00:40:54,596 --> 00:40:56,431
We've got a serious problem.

456
00:40:56,807 --> 00:41:01,186
I cross-referenced the Surfer's radiation
through every astronomical database.

457
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:04,815
Altair 7, Rigel 3, Vega 6.

458
00:41:04,982 --> 00:41:08,026
- He's been to all these planets?
- And now they're lifeless.

459
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:10,487
Barren. Some even shattered.

460
00:41:10,654 --> 00:41:14,491
Everywhere the Surfer goes,
eight days later, the planet dies.

461
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:19,746
How are we gonna stop him?

462
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:22,207
We don't even know where he is.

463
00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:26,044
What about the craters?

464
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:34,052
They appear in a numerical sequence.

465
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:37,556
The last crater was formed
in Greenland...

466
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:40,100
...so the next in the sequence
should be...

467
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:43,186
...latitude 51 degrees,
30 minutes north...

468
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:48,817
...longitude zero degrees,
seven minutes west.

469
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:03,540
When he surfaces, move the fight
away from the crowd.

470
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:06,793
He's too fast to contain.
When I see silver, I'm hitting him!

471
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,047
You can't do that. We stick to the plan
and work as a team.

472
00:42:10,213 --> 00:42:11,798
Oh, we're a team now?
News to me.

473
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:14,801
- What are you talking about?
- You know what.

474
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:16,261
We were gonna tell you.

475
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:20,057
- When? When you moved our stuff out?
- Johnny, this isn't a good time.

476
00:42:20,223 --> 00:42:23,060
Kid's got a point, Reed.
You should have told us.

477
00:42:23,268 --> 00:42:25,562
That's enough!
We'll talk about this later.

478
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:28,315
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

479
00:42:34,946 --> 00:42:36,657
It's a whirlpool!

480
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:38,158
Oh, my God.

481
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:46,124
What is that?

482
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:05,352
Get out! Get out!

483
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,207
Don't let go!

484
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:40,304
- Move!
- Come on! Go!

485
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:59,072
No, Johnny!

486
00:44:18,342 --> 00:44:20,552
Guys? What are you doing?

487
00:44:28,852 --> 00:44:30,604
Ben! Lift it higher!

488
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:32,356
I'll try.

489
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:05,681
Sue!

490
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:14,648
Stay back,
before you get somebody killed.

491
00:45:17,776 --> 00:45:19,903
Oh, my God.

492
00:45:40,048 --> 00:45:41,425
What the hell was that?

493
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:44,886
We'll make adjustments.
Next time, we'll be ready.

494
00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:47,639
Next time? There's no next time.

495
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:52,102
You can't handle this alone.
I'm bringing in help.

496
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:56,315
Bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger.

497
00:45:56,481 --> 00:45:57,983
No more than you already have.

498
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,906
Victor?

499
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:08,785
What's the matter?
Afraid of ghosts?

500
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:12,581
- Look out!
- Don't move!

501
00:46:12,748 --> 00:46:16,335
Since you're a ghost,
you won't mind if I break your neck.

502
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,378
- Let him go.
- You know who that is?

503
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:21,006
Victor von Doom.
He's here under my orders.

504
00:46:28,013 --> 00:46:29,056
Ben, let him go.

505
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:34,102
How is this possible?

506
00:46:36,855 --> 00:46:38,357
How are you still alive?

507
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,110
No thanks to you four,
that's for certain.

508
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,947
V on Doom's made contact with the
alien. He's got valuable information.

509
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:49,451
Information that might just
help save the planet.

510
00:46:49,993 --> 00:46:51,787
<i>Now let's be clear about this...</i>

511
00:46:52,162 --> 00:46:54,873
...shall we? I hate you.

512
00:46:57,501 --> 00:46:59,127
All of you.

513
00:47:00,045 --> 00:47:04,800
But the world's at stake and we
need to work together to survive.

514
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:09,638
General, we know firsthand, you trust
victor and you're gonna regret it.

515
00:47:09,805 --> 00:47:14,226
So far, the only one I've regretted
trusting here is you, Richards.

516
00:47:15,978 --> 00:47:17,396
Reed, don't agree to this.

517
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:25,237
Let's see what he's got.

518
00:47:25,904 --> 00:47:28,991
I made a detailed recording
of our little encounter.

519
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:32,661
<i>All that you know is at an end.</i>

520
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:36,498
Well?

521
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:40,210
I like the part where
he knocks you on your ass.

522
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:46,675
Look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me.

523
00:47:48,677 --> 00:47:50,637
There? See what happened?

524
00:47:53,473 --> 00:47:57,728
The energy was channeled through him,
but it originated from his board.

525
00:47:57,894 --> 00:48:02,274
If we can separate him from the board,
we can cut off his power completely.

526
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:05,110
- That's what we have to do.
- How?

527
00:48:05,277 --> 00:48:08,238
If I knew that,
I wouldn't need you people, would I?

528
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,909
You two should
get started right away.

529
00:48:18,957 --> 00:48:21,585
I'm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again.

530
00:48:23,587 --> 00:48:26,423
I'll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up.

531
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:36,099
How can we be working
on the same side as Victor?

532
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:39,978
You got me. Things were simpler
when I could just whale on the guy.

533
00:48:40,562 --> 00:48:42,981
What's he doing? A fire.

534
00:48:43,148 --> 00:48:44,650
Look at that.

535
00:48:48,278 --> 00:48:49,946
I'll pay for that.

536
00:48:51,448 --> 00:48:55,118
I'll tell you, Ben, I'm starting
to feel like a complete screw-up.

537
00:48:55,285 --> 00:48:58,080
Hey, hey, you're not
a complete screw-up.

538
00:48:58,246 --> 00:48:59,831
Thank you.

539
00:48:59,998 --> 00:49:03,919
Look, kid, it's out of our hands.
It's up to the eggheads now.

540
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:08,715
You think Reed's right about
the whole end-of-the-world thing?

541
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:11,677
He's never been wrong
about this kind of thing before.

542
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:14,888
You know, I'm not exactly
a deep kind of guy.

543
00:49:15,472 --> 00:49:16,640
Really?

544
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:21,311
<i>But if Reed's right, and this is it...</i>

545
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:27,234
...how do you want
to spend your last few minutes?

546
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:30,654
Part of me would like
to go out fighting.

547
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,866
But the truth is...

548
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:38,203
<i>... I'd like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding Alicia.</i>

549
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:42,916
That sounds pretty good.

550
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:46,545
I mean, not the "holding Alicia" thing.
She's your girlfriend, not mine.

551
00:49:46,753 --> 00:49:49,756
Want nothing to do with her.
Not to say she's not attractive.

552
00:49:49,923 --> 00:49:53,385
She's very attractive.
She's so attractive.

553
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:57,764
Even with the... I can't think of
a guy that wouldn't want to...

554
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:01,059
What I meant...

555
00:50:01,685 --> 00:50:03,854
<i>... was that it's nice
to have somebody.</i>

556
00:50:06,398 --> 00:50:09,234
Well, you got me, pal.

557
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:26,293
How's it going?

558
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,295
I can't find a link.

559
00:50:28,712 --> 00:50:31,006
- It'll be all right.
- No, it won't!

560
00:50:31,173 --> 00:50:34,885
The whole world's
counting on me, and I just...

561
00:50:35,052 --> 00:50:37,638
Reed, you're gonna find the answer.

562
00:50:37,804 --> 00:50:39,431
- You always do.
- Thanks, Sue.

563
00:50:39,598 --> 00:50:41,391
- You just need to relax.
- Yeah, right.

564
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:45,354
You do. Reed, you need to relax.

565
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:48,190
Take a deep breath.

566
00:50:48,899 --> 00:50:50,734
Slower.

567
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:52,986
There you go.

568
00:50:53,945 --> 00:50:56,448
Come on. Again.

569
00:50:58,116 --> 00:51:02,704
See? I can already
feel your pulse slowing down.

570
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:07,542
- Do you remember that time...?
- A pulse.

571
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,171
A tachyon pulse.

572
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,882
I love you.

573
00:51:14,591 --> 00:51:16,051
I'm glad I could help.

574
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,116
<i>So exactly how does this thing work?</i>

575
00:51:39,282 --> 00:51:42,369
<i>When we activate the field,
it'll separate him from his board...</i>

576
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:45,622
...making him powerless.
- Like a fish in a net.

577
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:47,749
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

578
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,627
- In theory, anyway.
- How long until it's operational?

579
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:53,839
- Three hours.
- Three hours.

580
00:51:54,006 --> 00:51:56,883
I can only go so fast,
since I'm working by myself.

581
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:00,762
- What do you need to make this happen?
- There are a couple of things.

582
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:03,849
Do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing?

583
00:52:14,484 --> 00:52:16,278
What are you doing?

584
00:52:17,404 --> 00:52:20,157
- Don't you knock?
- You're supposed to be helping Reed.

585
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,700
Tell him not to worry.

586
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:25,454
I'll be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him.

587
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:33,503
- Anything else?
- How'd you do it?

588
00:52:35,464 --> 00:52:36,798
How did you come back?

589
00:52:40,636 --> 00:52:42,346
It scares you, doesn't it?

590
00:52:45,307 --> 00:52:46,808
The things I can do.

591
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:50,437
<i>Did you know I could create
a force field inside someone's body...</i>

592
00:52:50,604 --> 00:52:52,564
...and expand it until they explode?

593
00:52:53,315 --> 00:52:55,108
Give it your best shot.

594
00:52:59,738 --> 00:53:02,282
Just get back to the lab.

595
00:53:09,373 --> 00:53:10,999
Mr. Storm?

596
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:14,711
We're heading to intercept the Surfer
in 10 minutes, with or without you.

597
00:53:14,878 --> 00:53:20,550
Were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel?

598
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,351
That was a joke. I was joking.

599
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:32,521
Why are you so down on me?
You don't even know me.

600
00:53:32,854 --> 00:53:36,149
I know you very well.
I read your personality profile.

601
00:53:36,692 --> 00:53:39,152
Confident. Reckless. Irresponsible.

602
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:41,613
Self-obsessed,
bordering on narcissism.

603
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,616
Okay, so you do know me.

604
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:48,120
All I've seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed.

605
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,664
Okay.

606
00:53:51,248 --> 00:53:53,917
I've been a little off my game lately.

607
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:56,253
This is not a game.

608
00:54:10,392 --> 00:54:12,769
- Sir, he's in position north of here.
- Good.

609
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:15,856
- General, give us a one-mile perimeter.
- Forget it, Richards.

610
00:54:16,023 --> 00:54:19,318
You had your shot and you blew it.
This is a military operation now.

611
00:54:19,484 --> 00:54:22,738
Jam the signal, get out of the way,
and let us do our job.

612
00:54:22,904 --> 00:54:26,074
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

613
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:29,036
So let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks.

614
00:54:29,244 --> 00:54:32,164
I'm the quarterback.
You're on my team.

615
00:54:32,748 --> 00:54:33,874
Got it?

616
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:39,921
But I guess you never played football
in high school, did you, Richards?

617
00:54:40,547 --> 00:54:42,466
No, you're right, I didn't.

618
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:46,345
I stayed in and studied,
like a good little nerd.

619
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:49,931
And fifteen years later...

620
00:54:50,098 --> 00:54:52,976
<i>... I'm one of the greatest minds
of the 21 st century.</i>

621
00:54:53,185 --> 00:54:55,395
I'm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet.

622
00:54:56,188 --> 00:54:58,815
And the jock who played quarterback
in high school...

623
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:01,943
...is right in front of me,
asking me for my help.

624
00:55:02,944 --> 00:55:06,156
And I say he's not gonna
get a damn thing...

625
00:55:06,323 --> 00:55:08,992
...unless he does exactly
what I tell him to...

626
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:13,080
...and starts treating my friends
and me with some respect.

627
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:23,966
Give him what he wants.

628
00:55:26,134 --> 00:55:28,136
I am so hot for you right now.

629
00:55:28,303 --> 00:55:30,931
- Me too.
- Be careful, Johnny.

630
00:55:31,098 --> 00:55:33,350
All right, let's go to work.

631
00:55:44,027 --> 00:55:45,487
This is it.

632
00:55:45,904 --> 00:55:50,492
You have your coordinates. Set up
your posts and rendezvous back here.

633
00:56:02,587 --> 00:56:03,880
First squad, move out!

634
00:56:36,246 --> 00:56:41,376
Hey. You scared me there, Smokey.
Look at you. You're cute.

635
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,761
Yeah, that's right.
Keep running, Boo Boo.

636
00:56:52,888 --> 00:56:54,389
Overgrown furball.

637
00:56:56,224 --> 00:56:58,810
<i>- What's our status?
- Yeah. I'm good to go.</i>

638
00:56:58,977 --> 00:57:01,063
- Same here.
- Almost there.

639
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:13,742
Guys?

640
00:57:14,618 --> 00:57:16,954
<i>- We have a problem.
- What's wrong?</i>

641
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,372
He's here.

642
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,167
<i>Get out of there, right now!</i>

643
00:57:44,606 --> 00:57:46,483
Why are you destroying our planet?

644
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,362
I have no choice.

645
00:57:50,612 --> 00:57:52,531
- Sue!
- Wait!

646
00:57:55,701 --> 00:57:57,869
What do you mean,
you don't have a choice?

647
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,497
There's always a choice.

648
00:58:01,498 --> 00:58:03,500
Not always.

649
00:58:04,793 --> 00:58:07,296
Why are you trying to destroy us?

650
00:58:07,587 --> 00:58:10,299
I am not the Destroyer.

651
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,011
Come on, Richards.
Jam the damn signal.

652
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:16,805
Maybe he needs a little persuasion.

653
00:58:18,181 --> 00:58:20,517
<i>- Fire one over the top.
- Roger, out.</i>

654
00:58:35,115 --> 00:58:36,241
- Open fire.
- Open fire.

655
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,493
Open fire! Repeat, open fire!

656
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,212
Fall back! Fall back!

657
00:58:52,174 --> 00:58:54,259
- Let me just...
- No, wait!

658
00:58:55,844 --> 00:58:57,638
Reed.

659
00:58:58,305 --> 00:58:59,348
Come on, Sue.

660
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:02,893
All right, it's up.

661
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:05,145
Reed.

662
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:06,438
Got him.

663
00:59:31,797 --> 00:59:35,592
Not so tough now, are you?

664
00:59:43,725 --> 00:59:46,144
Victor! Stay back!

665
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:48,480
You're the quarterback.

666
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:08,500
Eyes on!
Keep your weapons trained!

667
01:00:09,126 --> 01:00:11,378
- Perimeter secure!
- Move him out.

668
01:00:17,634 --> 01:00:20,012
- Open the gate!
- Get him to the debriefing room.

669
01:00:33,483 --> 01:00:35,110
- We had an agreement.
- Calm down.

670
01:00:35,277 --> 01:00:36,987
The enemy has been captured.

671
01:00:37,154 --> 01:00:39,114
- Where is he?
- Contained.

672
01:00:39,781 --> 01:00:41,408
General?

673
01:00:42,701 --> 01:00:44,036
Mr. Sherman.

674
01:00:46,705 --> 01:00:49,041
If you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

675
01:00:49,207 --> 01:00:52,461
- I want to be there for the questioning.
- Not gonna happen.

676
01:00:52,628 --> 01:00:56,173
Make sure our guests remain here,
comfortably.

677
01:00:56,381 --> 01:00:57,549
Yes, sir.

678
01:00:59,968 --> 01:01:01,887
General, what about the board?

679
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:05,724
It's in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal.

680
01:01:23,408 --> 01:01:25,911
<i>There are certain things
I'm not permitted to do...</i>

681
01:01:26,078 --> 01:01:28,747
...because they're considered
human-rights violations.

682
01:01:28,914 --> 01:01:32,084
Fortunately, you're not human.

683
01:01:38,465 --> 01:01:40,175
Are we prisoners?

684
01:01:40,342 --> 01:01:42,678
How did that happen?

685
01:01:42,844 --> 01:01:45,889
Apparently, they don't want us
interfering with their methods.

686
01:01:46,056 --> 01:01:48,350
I can't imagine what
they're doing to him.

687
01:01:48,517 --> 01:01:51,561
- I say he gets what he deserves.
- How can you say that?

688
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:54,564
I'm just saying maybe
the general's right about this.

689
01:01:54,731 --> 01:01:57,818
The guy was about to destroy
the planet. He said so himself.

690
01:01:57,985 --> 01:02:02,656
It doesn't make sense. He protected me
from the missile. Why would he do that?

691
01:02:02,864 --> 01:02:04,658
Maybe he thinks you're cute.

692
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:07,786
There's more going on.
He said he wasn't the Destroyer.

693
01:02:07,953 --> 01:02:09,538
Maybe he lied?

694
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:16,420
We need to get inside there
and talk to him.

695
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,172
But under the radar.

696
01:02:23,218 --> 01:02:26,471
Is there any way
we could get some DVDs...

697
01:02:26,638 --> 01:02:28,515
...or popcorn or something?

698
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:30,350
- I'll call it in.
- Great.

699
01:02:30,517 --> 01:02:32,436
Thank you. Semper fi.

700
01:02:32,602 --> 01:02:35,314
That's the Marine corps.
We're the Army.

701
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,150
Right, I know it's the Army.

702

<i>Captain Raye. Access granted.</i>

703
01:03:02,591 --> 01:03:04,092
General.

704
01:03:04,259 --> 01:03:07,012
Von Doom wants to speak with you.

705
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:10,641
You should really be
a little more cooperative.

706
01:03:10,807 --> 01:03:13,518
Mr. Sherman, let's take a break.

707
01:03:31,495 --> 01:03:32,537
I know you are there.

708
01:03:45,759 --> 01:03:47,302
What's your name?

709
01:03:49,554 --> 01:03:51,556
Come on, you must have a name.

710
01:03:52,391 --> 01:03:53,934
I'm Susan.

711
01:03:58,647 --> 01:04:03,694
You said you weren't the one trying
to destroy our world. Then who is?

712
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,363
- The one I serve.
- Who do you serve?

713
01:04:09,491 --> 01:04:13,954
I'm trying to help you, but to do that,
you have to tell me the truth.

714
01:04:14,496 --> 01:04:15,706
Please.

715
01:04:27,217 --> 01:04:30,762
It is known by many names.
My people called it...

716
01:04:31,722 --> 01:04:33,724
...Galactus...

717
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:35,642
...the Devourer of Worlds.

718
01:04:39,354 --> 01:04:42,691
It must feed on energy to survive.

719
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:44,359
Both thermal...

720
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,486
...and organic.

721
01:04:46,653 --> 01:04:48,196
How can you serve this thing?

722
01:04:48,363 --> 01:04:49,865
Because I must.

723
01:04:50,032 --> 01:04:54,620
Doesn't it bother you, all the worlds and
innocent people you've helped destroy?

724
01:04:54,911 --> 01:04:59,041
My service spares my world...

725
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:01,418
...and the one I love.

726
01:05:03,962 --> 01:05:06,089
Why did you try to protect me?

727
01:05:07,674 --> 01:05:09,051
Because...

728
01:05:10,177 --> 01:05:13,764
...you remind me of her.

729
01:05:27,819 --> 01:05:30,030
Could you stop the Destroyer
if you wanted to?

730
01:05:30,238 --> 01:05:34,076
It is not I who draws the Destroyer here.
It is the beacon.

731
01:05:34,409 --> 01:05:35,994
What's the beacon?

732
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:38,288
The source of my power.

733
01:05:38,455 --> 01:05:39,498
Your board?

734
01:05:44,169 --> 01:05:47,839
Take joy in the last few hours
you have left...

735
01:05:48,006 --> 01:05:50,217
...for he is nearly here.

736
01:06:07,192 --> 01:06:10,737
Well? I helped deliver
the alien to you, as promised.

737
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,032
Now it's time to keep
your end of the bargain.

738
01:06:14,908 --> 01:06:17,452
You can do your tests on the board...

739
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,332
...but under armed guard
and in my presence only.

740
01:06:22,499 --> 01:06:24,876
Absolutely.

741

<i>General Hager. Access granted.</i>

742
01:06:57,743 --> 01:06:59,077
The board draws it here.

743
01:06:59,244 --> 01:07:01,204
How do you fight something
that eats planets?

744
01:07:01,371 --> 01:07:04,249
We have to get to the board
and lead it away from here.

745
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:07,336
Well, do you think the general
will go for that?

746
01:07:07,502 --> 01:07:09,129
He'll have no choice.

747
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:13,675
Thank you, general.

<i>But I'm afraid...</i>

749

750
01:07:18,847 --> 01:07:21,266
...sometimes Reed is right.

751
01:07:24,978 --> 01:07:26,480
What...?

752
01:07:38,992 --> 01:07:41,078
Hey, you. Come here.

753
01:07:41,536 --> 01:07:43,538
Let me ask you something.

754
01:08:45,684 --> 01:08:47,269
Nice.

755
01:08:51,481 --> 01:08:53,066
Crap.

756
01:09:00,073 --> 01:09:01,658
Ben!

757
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:07,623
Okay, that one hurt.

758
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:10,917
- Where's Reed?
- Back here.

759
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:23,013
My bad.

760
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:33,023
Reed.

761
01:09:37,194 --> 01:09:40,155
Victor. We've gotta get it back.

762
01:09:40,322 --> 01:09:43,033
We need to get the Surfer.
He understands its power.

763
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:47,412
Even if we break him out of this place,
how are we gonna catch up to Victor?

764
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,123
Leave that to me.

765
01:10:19,778 --> 01:10:22,030
- Halt!
- Stay where you are!

766
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:28,662
Pal, this is the luckiest day
of your life.

767
01:10:31,957 --> 01:10:35,210
What the hell is going on?
Where is General Hager?

768
01:10:35,419 --> 01:10:36,545
He's dead.

769
01:10:36,837 --> 01:10:39,464
And if we don't get him out of here,
we'll all be.

770
01:10:39,673 --> 01:10:41,300
Frankie...

771
01:10:43,343 --> 01:10:47,472
...the world is literally at stake here.
You have to trust us.

772
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:50,559
Please.

773
01:10:53,854 --> 01:10:56,648
We need to get to the roof.
It should be here by now.

774
01:10:56,815 --> 01:10:58,900
What should be here?

775
01:11:08,118 --> 01:11:10,120
Holy crap!

776
01:11:10,287 --> 01:11:11,872
Reed.

777
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:14,875
This is by far the coolest thing
you have ever done.

778
01:11:24,593 --> 01:11:26,053
- Hemi?
- Of course.

779
01:11:27,638 --> 01:11:30,349
Okay, Ben, you get inside.
Johnny, you fly behind us.

780
01:11:30,515 --> 01:11:33,894
- You gotta let me fly this.
- I'm the best pilot. I should drive.

781
01:11:34,061 --> 01:11:36,146
- Guys.
- You're lucky if it can carry you.

782
01:11:36,313 --> 01:11:38,523
- I can fly circles around you.
- Guys!

783
01:11:38,732 --> 01:11:41,860
- Reed.
- Shut up! And move it!

784
01:11:42,027 --> 01:11:43,820
I'm driving.

785
01:11:46,698 --> 01:11:48,492
Flame on!

786
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:59,503
Okay. We're now officially enemies
of the United States of America.

787
01:11:59,711 --> 01:12:02,464
Victor is out there somewhere
with unlimited power.

788
01:12:02,631 --> 01:12:05,258
And we've got a giant
intergalactic force...

789
01:12:05,425 --> 01:12:10,180
...that's about to destroy our planet in
less than 24 hours. Did I miss anything?

790
01:12:11,056 --> 01:12:14,601
I've locked on victor's energy trail.
He's headed over Southeast china.

791
01:12:14,768 --> 01:12:16,353
Hang on.

792
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,275
Norrin Radd.

793
01:12:23,777 --> 01:12:28,365
- What?
- I was once called Norrin Radd.

794
01:12:29,032 --> 01:12:31,660
Norrin, we'll need your help
to save our world.

795
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,121
Do you understand?

796
01:12:39,418 --> 01:12:40,877
What the hell was that?

797
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:47,092
Victor, the board is drawing the
Destroyer here. You have to give it up.

798
01:12:47,467 --> 01:12:50,053
You know, I've never
been the giving type, Reed.

799
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:52,055
Hold on!

800
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:07,362
We're sitting ducks!

801
01:13:07,571 --> 01:13:09,156
We're gonna have to split up!

802
01:13:09,323 --> 01:13:10,741
- What?
- This ought to be fun!

803
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:13,285
Stay close to me, Sue!

804
01:13:41,271 --> 01:13:42,606
He's really pissing me off!

805
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:51,156
Surf's up, metalhead!

806
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:58,413
Victor, only the Surfer can stop the
Destroyer. But he needs his board.

807
01:13:59,081 --> 01:14:01,500
- Come and get it, Richards.
- Victor.

808
01:14:06,296 --> 01:14:09,591
Let's all go for a spin!

809
01:14:48,213 --> 01:14:49,840
Norrin!

810
01:14:51,883 --> 01:14:53,135
Catch.

811
01:15:07,524 --> 01:15:09,318
Sue!

812
01:15:14,072 --> 01:15:15,574
Oh, my God.

813
01:15:15,741 --> 01:15:17,326
Sue. Sue.

814
01:15:17,534 --> 01:15:19,786
- Oh, God.
- Johnny, don't touch her!

815
01:15:23,707 --> 01:15:24,916
Oh, God. Oh, God.

816
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:27,169
You need to find a way
to get the board.

817
01:15:27,377 --> 01:15:29,796
- Sue, I...
- Okay.

818
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:39,431
He is here.

819
01:15:47,689 --> 01:15:49,024
Reed?

820
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:51,234
Reed.

821
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:56,698
Victor's gotta have a pulse emitter
linking him to his board.

822
01:15:56,865 --> 01:16:00,327
We take it out,
we can separate him from his board.

823
01:16:00,535 --> 01:16:01,787
He's too strong for me.

824
01:16:01,954 --> 01:16:03,956
I could whale on him if I get close...

825
01:16:04,122 --> 01:16:07,000
...but he could see me coming
from a mile away.

826
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:10,587
It would take all of us.

827
01:16:11,797 --> 01:16:13,215
Or maybe just one of us.

828
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:20,555
We don't know
what it could do to you.

829
01:16:21,306 --> 01:16:23,350
Let's not make this about me.

830
01:16:45,414 --> 01:16:46,748
To quote a friend of mine...

831
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,042
<i>... it's clobbering time.</i>

832
01:17:46,016 --> 01:17:47,976
You ain't going down fighting, kid.

833
01:17:49,811 --> 01:17:51,104
Not without me.

834
01:19:28,994 --> 01:19:30,954
You've gotta go.

835
01:20:01,234 --> 01:20:03,987
Treasure each moment with her.

836
01:20:04,196 --> 01:20:06,239
And tell her she was right.

837
01:20:07,032 --> 01:20:10,410
We do have a choice.

838
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:38,188
Thought you could use a hand.

839
01:20:42,985 --> 01:20:44,319
Oh, my God.

840
01:21:14,308 --> 01:21:16,601
Why isn't it working?

841
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:19,187
We were too late.

842
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:30,032
I will no longer serve.

843
01:21:32,034 --> 01:21:37,122
This is the end for us both.

844
01:22:58,453 --> 01:22:59,913
Hi.

845
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,126
Hi.

846
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:09,715
What did I miss?

847
01:23:18,849 --> 01:23:20,600
Hey! Hey!

848
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:23,854
- He did it.
- Great job, kid.

849
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:27,941
Hey, wait. I'm not changing.

850
01:23:28,275 --> 01:23:30,694
Hey, that's right.

851
01:23:30,861 --> 01:23:32,696
Great.

852
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,658
Okay, now you're making
me uncomfortable.

853
01:23:56,053 --> 01:23:58,388
So I guess this is it.

854
01:23:58,847 --> 01:24:01,224
We all go our separate ways.

855
01:24:01,725 --> 01:24:03,268
No.

856
01:24:03,977 --> 01:24:05,646
- No?
- No.

857
01:24:05,812 --> 01:24:07,272
- No?
- If not for the team...

858
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:09,066
...the whole world would be gone.

859
01:24:09,232 --> 01:24:13,612
We can't run away from our
responsibilities. This is who we are.

860
01:24:13,779 --> 01:24:16,865
- That's what I've been saying.
- What about having a normal life?

861
01:24:17,032 --> 01:24:19,242
- A family?
- Who says you have to be normal...

862
01:24:19,409 --> 01:24:21,203
...to have a family?

863
01:24:22,371 --> 01:24:27,209
So are you up for another media-circus
wedding? Fifth time's a charm.

864
01:24:27,376 --> 01:24:29,086
No.

865
01:24:31,254 --> 01:24:33,090
I got a better idea.

866
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:49,314
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Reed Richards...

867
01:24:49,523 --> 01:24:52,734
...and Sue Storm together in holy...

868
01:24:52,901 --> 01:24:55,487
...matrimony.

869
01:24:55,654 --> 01:24:58,615
- What is it?
- Venice is sinking into the Adriatic.

870
01:24:58,782 --> 01:25:00,617
Oh, boy. That's a biggie.

871
01:25:00,784 --> 01:25:03,245
Could we just skip to the end?

872
01:25:03,453 --> 01:25:06,999
- Yeah. The love these two share...
- No, the very end.

873
01:25:07,207 --> 01:25:09,668
Yeah, great. You have the rings?

874
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:19,553
Oh, yeah.

875
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:23,348
I now pronounce you man and wife,
and you may kiss the bride.

876
01:25:30,022 --> 01:25:32,649
- Okay. We should get out of here.
- Yeah.

877
01:25:32,816 --> 01:25:35,110
- Gotta go, hon.
- Okay.

878
01:25:39,406 --> 01:25:40,824
I have to throw the bouquet.

879
01:25:41,783 --> 01:25:43,452
Ready?

880
01:25:52,377 --> 01:25:54,630
Heads up, Johnny.

881
01:26:04,931 --> 01:26:06,767
Sorry.

882
01:26:07,893 --> 01:26:09,019
Reflex.

883
01:26:10,305 --> 01:27:10,587
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
