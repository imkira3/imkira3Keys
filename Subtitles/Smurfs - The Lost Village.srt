1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,158
<i>This story begins in a secret place</i>
<i>hidden deep in a forest.</i>

3
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,873
<i>That is a Smurf.</i>

4
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,758
<i>We call him Clumsy.</i>

5
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,876
<i>And this is our village,</i>

6
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,397
<i>where there's a Smurf</i>
<i>for just about everything.</i>

7
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,914
<i>Like Jokey.</i>

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,514
Hey, here's a present for you.

9
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,958
Gullible Smurf, you're so gullible.

10
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,952
Actually, I meant to give you this one.

11
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,190
Thanks!

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,870
- 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
- <i>Here's Hefty.</i>

13
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,356
<i>And over here is...</i>

14
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,954
Now, for the one-fingered pushup.

15
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,633
One, two, three...

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,473
<i>Meet Nerdy Smurf.</i>

17
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,519
- Excuse me?
- <i>Sorry, Brainy. Just kidding.</i>

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,875
<i>Nosey.</i>

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,429
Well, what's going on over there?

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,074
<i>Paranoid Smurf.</i>

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,520
<i>Winner.</i>

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,556
<i>Loser.</i>

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,869
<i>Karate Smurf.</i>

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,000
<i>Handy. Vanity. Farmer. Painter. Baker.</i>

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,311
<i>Magician. Scuba. Policeman. Therapist.</i>

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,800
Sometimes I just feel blue.

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,877
<i>There's even Table-Eating Smurf.</i>

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,030
Hi.

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,999
<i>Yeah, we're not too sure about him, either.</i>

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,515
<i>And then there's me, Papa Smurf.</i>

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,359
<i>I sort of run this place.</i>

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,750
<i>But this isn't a story about me.</i>

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,910
<i>Or Clumsy.</i>

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,151
<i>Or any of them.</i>

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,074
<i>It's about the only girl in our village.</i>

36
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,479
<i>Smurfette.</i>

37
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,755
Hi, Laundry Smurf.

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,718
- Howdy-do, Smurfette.
- Hey, guys.

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,157
<i>But that's not the only thing</i>
<i>that's different about Smurfette.</i>

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,990
<i>She was created by the evil wizard, Gargamel.</i>

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,639
<i>Using dark magic,</i>

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,597
<i>he made her from a lump of clay.</i>

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,038
Now, go and find Smurf Village.

44
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,752
<i>Luckily, I knew a little magic of my own.</i>

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,032
<i>But there was still one problem.</i>

46
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,352
<i>Smurfette's name doesn't</i>
<i>tell us anything about her.</i>

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,715
Okay, the physics are...

48
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,560
<i>It doesn't tell us who she is.</i>

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,317
- High heels.
- <i>Or what she does.</i>

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,000
<i>So, what exactly is a Smurfette?</i>

51
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,917
Well, let me be frank. She's a rubbish baker.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,912
Let's see. Smurfette.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,071
Smurfette, Smurfette, Smurfette.

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,594
It's not here.

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,356
Well, Smurfette is a combination
of a Smurf and an Ette.

56
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,033
But what's an Ette?

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,151
Yeah. Smurfette, well, she's...

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,833
She's the greatest.

59
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,313
The most wondrous creature on Earth.

60
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,357
Yes, you are.

61
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,920
Smurfette...

62
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,196
I got it.

63
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,593
This is one of those eternal questions
that we'll never, ever know the answer to.

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,159
Wait, she is?

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,515
Do you think she heard me?

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,798
<i>So, what is a Smurfette?</i>

67
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,159
<i>No one wanted that answer</i>
<i>more than Smurfette herself.</i>

68
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,680
What are you doing?

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,559
Hey, Grouchy, I was just...

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,710
Leaving?

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,953
This is my bench.

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,475
I come here same time every day, and I...

73
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,791
Let me guess. "And grouch."

74
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,314
Exactly.

75
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,315
I can do that. I can grouch.

76
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,594
Hi, Grouchy. Hi, Smurfette. Nice day, huh?

77
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,875
No, it's not.

78
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,872
It's gonna rain!

79
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,677
Which actually helps the plants grow.

80
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,631
But also means it's gonna be cloudy,
so, chew on that.

81
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,837
Then again, there might be a rainbow.

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,037
But rainbows are dumb.

83
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,079
Just kidding. I love rainbows.

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,712
You're not very good at this, are ya?

85
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,230
No, I'm not.

86
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,915
In fact, you're actually kind of bad at it.

87
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,876
Yup.

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,353
But you're also bad at it.

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,760
That's a lie.

90
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,672
You're really, really good at it.

91
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,669
Hi, Brainy.

92
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,553
Smurfette. Thank goodness you're here.

93
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,960
I was...

94
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,872
We're running trials on my new invention.

95
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,475
The Smurfy Thing Finder.

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,557
Test subject, Hefty Smurf.

97
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,040
Hey, Smurfette!

98
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,713
I mean...

99
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,634
- Hey, Smurfette.
- Hey.

100
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,994
That thing's safe, right?

101
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,879
Is it safe? Of course.

102
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,679
I'd get back here if I were you.

103
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,990
Snappy Bug.

104
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,190
Take this down.
Smurfy Thing Finder trial 1.03.

105
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,556
- Ready, Hefty?
- Roger that.

106
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,676
It works!

107
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,919
This thing really gets me.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,071
It's able to hone in
on Hefty's dominant trait.

109
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,560
Super strength.

110
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,075
Which I distill into this.

111
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,198
I call it Brainy's Super Smurfy Power Fuel.

112
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,078
Here, you can try it first.

113
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,272
All clear!

114
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,274
Yeah, you see, when you say things
like "all clear," it makes me not want to...

115
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,510
Hey, guys.

116
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,390
Hi, Clumsy.

117
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,440
You're just in time
to witness scientific history.

118
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,795
What's going on in here?

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,196
None of your business, Nosey.

120
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,032
Well, all right.

121
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,960
Hey! If that vegetable hat
can tell us that Hefty is strong,

122
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,760
maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.

123
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,035
Power it up, Brainy.

124
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,749
Fascinating.

125
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,718
What happened?

126
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,396
Somehow, instead of sending energy out,
you absorbed it.

127
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,598
Probably something to do
with the fact that you're not a real...

128
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,950
A real Smurf? Go ahead, you can say it.

129
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,759
No, no, I just meant that

130
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,154
this machine wasn't built
for a Smurf of your, well, origins.

131
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,749
Yeah, it's okay. I get it.

132
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,996
Brainy.

133
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,352
Hey, you know what?
Let's all go have some fun.

134
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,794
Yeah!

135
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,837
- Pizza!
- Smurfboarding!

136
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,189
Smurfboarding!

137
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,954
It's almost ready, Azrael.

138
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,956
A pinch of newt poo.

139
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,193
A gram of calcified fungus
from between the toes of a yak.

140
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,239
And a piece of cheese
I left in my underpants last week.

141
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,150
That ought to do it.

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,236
Presto!

143
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,870
Twelve spherical petrification modules.

144
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,317
Or, as I like to call 'em, freeze balls.

145
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,956
You're welcome, Azrael. Dinner is served.

146
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,399
Ingrate.

147
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,871
Besides, these freeze balls
aren't for catching mice.

148
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,954
They're for capturing those elusive Smurfs.

149
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,360
My holy grail.

150
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,909
The gold at the end of my rainbow.

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,596
The most potent magical ingredient
in the world.

152
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,909
Next slide.

153
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,150
Imagine the power in 100 of them combined.

154
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,279
How I've searched high and low,
under every rock, it seems,

155
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,113
with no sign of them anywhere.

156
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,272
Not now, Azrael.
I'm in the middle of a lecture.

157
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,873
My plan is simple.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,119
Find Smurf Village, capture all the Smurfs,
drain them of their magic

159
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,832
and, finally, use that magic to become
the most powerful wizard in the world!

160
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,600
Look at me with hair.

161
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,629
What?

162
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,189
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

163
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,556
Blue blazes!
I've spotted Smurfs in the forest!

164
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,077
Well, it's my telescope. Monty!

165
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,996
Come, my majestic eagle.

166
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,279
Your talons are digging into my shoulders.

167
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,230
That's better.

168
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,312
Now, fly.

169
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,154
Go capture me some Smurfs.

170
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,799
No, no!

171
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,395
No, you're going the wrong way!

172
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,510
Yeah!

173
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,750
Oh, no.

174
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,114
My turn!

175
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,839
Safety third.

176
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,235
Oh, boy.

177
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,310
Yeah!

178
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,516
Really takes your breath away, doesn't she?

179
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,317
This is incredible!

180
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,393
Oh, no! She's getting way too close
to the Forbidden Forest.

181
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,392
She can't go over that wall. Come on.

182
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,592
No, no, no, wait. Don't go.

183
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,679
Wait. Wait, who are you? Don't be afraid.

184
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,234
Hey, you can't go in there.

185
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,639
- Smurfette!
- Smurfette!

186
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,110
- Smurfette, you okay?
- What happened? What happened?

187
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,079
I saw a Smurf.

188
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,395
- What?
- Who was it?

189
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,154
I don't know, but he was wearing this.

190
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,712
Smurfette! Code blue!

191
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,836
Guys, come on.

192
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,639
We've gotta get her.

193
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,951
I have a bad feeling about this.

194
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,190
Do you?

195
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,354
Does it have to do with the giant vulture
carrying our friend off to Gargamel's lair?

196
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,630
Monty, my regal raptor.

197
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,598
You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.

198
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,830
Give me a kiss.

199
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,474
Finally, you bring me
what I've been asking for.

200
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,155
A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless... You!

201
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,120
Let me out of here,
you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.

202
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,797
Is that any way to talk to the man
who brought you into this world?

203
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,079
I'd prefer it if you just called me "Papa."

204
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,634
- I would never call you that.
- Your loss.

205
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,551
What's this? What are you hiding?

206
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,836
Hand it over, you pseudo-Smurf.

207
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,594
Thank you, Azrael.

208
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,110
What do we have here?

209
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,310
A different design?
Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.

210
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,073
Slightly before you did, in fact.

211
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,398
- Where did you get it?
- I'm not telling you anything.

212
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,392
- Tell me.
- No.

213
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,675
- Tell me!
- No!

214
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,160
- You better tell me.
- No!

215
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,199
- Fine. Don't tell me.
- I won't.

216
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,594
Stupid reverse psychology never works.

217
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,752
Who cares?
You've already given me what I need.

218
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,513
Come along, Azrael.

219
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,431
Where on earth did I put those ingredients?

220
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,716
I know this. Go left, then right,
back handspring, stick the landing.

221
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,712
Is it a person, book or movie?

222
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,634
No one ever understands
your hand signals, Hefty.

223
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,314
Never mind. Just follow me and stay close.

224
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,114
Wort of worm and hair of cat.

225
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,319
Show me the home of this Smurf hat.

226
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,676
<i>Long have you searched</i>
<i>for these creatures of blue.</i>

227
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,912
<i>But this hat comes from somewhere new.</i>

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,071
Yes. Where? Where does it come from?

229
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,279
<i>A village of Smurfs, where enchantment grows.</i>

230
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,592
An entire village. Good. Go on. Go on.

231
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,194
<i>The location of which...</i>

232
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,670
- Yes?
- <i>...nobody knows.</i>

233
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,232
No! Just start with that.
Start with "I don't know."

234
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,800
Lousy cheap-o cauldron.

235
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,472
<i>But here is a clue.</i>

236
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,429
Fascinating. But what is it?

237
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,549
Trees?

238
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,989
Must be a symbol for something, or a code.

239
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,790
Trees, trees, breeze, knees.
Babies crawl on their knees.

240
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,553
Check all the nurseries in the area!

241
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,397
We're going to need to
disguise ourselves as babies.

242
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,314
Now, where can I get a giant diaper?

243
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,359
Azrael, it's not your map.

244
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,911
You want your own map,
we'll get you your own map, but this is my...

245
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,794
Wait a minute. Look what I found.

246
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,314
Three tall trees, in the Forbidden Forest.

247
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,118
We've never searched there before.

248
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,799
I'm a genius.

249
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,199
Azrael, it's time to take a road trip.

250
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,198
Prepare my trail mix.

251
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,115
Smurfette, congratulations.

252
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,594
You've just led me
to an undiscovered population of Smurfs.

253
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,750
They have no idea we even exist.

254
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,991
I'll be like...

255
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,799
They'll be all like, "Oh, no!"

256
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,360
And I'll be like...

257
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,512
And they'll be like...
"Run! No! Run, run, run!"

258
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,159
You evil little genius.

259
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,120
The rotten apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree after all.

260
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,680
Does it?

261
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,520
Get your fur and feathers in gear, boys.
We leave at first light.

262
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,077
Right after breakfast, say 8:00, 8:30.
9:00 at the latest.

263
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,959
- Wait, Brainy, the map.
- I'm on it.

264
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,116
Fine, maybe 9:30.
Absolutely no later than 10:00, though.

265
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,351
- What the... It's a jailbreak!
- Go, go, go!

266
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,319
They know my plans. They'll ruin everything!

267
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,320
Is this safe?

268
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,837
Well, it's a giant crossbow,
so I'm gonna go with "no."

269
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,639
Don't let them escape.

270
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,232
- Where are the seat belts?
- Get them! Get those Smurfs!

271
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,639
Fire in the hole!

272
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,153
Get those Smurfs!

273
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,040
Azrael's gaining on us.

274
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,793
Incoming bird!

275
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,235
- This might hurt.
- No!

276
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,272
Come on. Smurf this way.

277
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,240
Run faster! Run faster!

278
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,471
Why are our legs so short?

279
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,631
Why are our feet so big?

280
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,157
- Why are my muscles so big?
- Really, man?

281
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,640
Guys! Guys! A little help here.

282
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,309
It's coming.

283
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,830
- Yes!
- All right!

284
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,512
Well, I know four Smurfs
who have some explaining to do.

285
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,432
- Oh, boy.
- Hi.

286
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,433
- Oh, my gosh. Papa, you will not believe it.
- We ran into the Forbidden Forest.

287
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,273
One at a time. One at a time.

288
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,955
Please. Please.

289
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,919
- Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.
- We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.

290
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,749
I've told you time and again,
the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.

291
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,039
And now you're talking about maps
and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.

292
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,713
None of this makes any sense,

293
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,872
and I really don't understand
why you can't follow simple rules.

294
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,270
You snuck out and it put you all in danger.

295
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,040
Seems to me the only way
I can keep you safe is if...

296
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,554
You're grounded.

297
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,756
- Grounded? No, not grounded!
- What? No way!

298
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,399
- But, Papa, but...
- Come on!

299
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,550
No "buts."

300
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,359
None of you are to take one step
out of your mushrooms

301
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,318
without telling me where you're going.
Do you understand that?

302
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,278
- You're right, Papa.
- What?

303
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,398
You're right.
I don't know what we were thinking.

304
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,074
Good. Because, as I was saying,
you behaved completely irresponsibly.

305
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,551
Yes. Right. Exactly.
I couldn't agree more. Right, guys?

306
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,154
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

307
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,799
- What are you talking about, Smurfette?
- Okay.

308
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,951
Yes, so... And furthermore...

309
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,635
In fact, I think we should all
go to our rooms right now

310
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,074
and think about what we've done.

311
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,197
- Well, I think that's...
- Tough, but fair.

312
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,430
- Come on, guys.
- Okay, okay.

313
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,715
- Okay, I'm moving.
- What's your endgame here?

314
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,075
Did you get pecked on the noggin, Smurfette?

315
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,072
- Actually, Smurfette...
- Don't worry, Papa.

316
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,039
We are certainly going to do
some thinking about what we did.

317
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,270
And so forth.

318
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,431
But we will definitely not be
leaving our rooms

319
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,273
until we've thought this whole thing out.

320
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,114
And then, just for good measure,
we'll think about it some more.

321
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,634
Yes, but...

322
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,915
Great talk, Papa.

323
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,400
I have no idea what I'm doing.

324
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,952
Hefty, I know that's you.

325
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,315
'Sup, Smurfette?

326
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,595
Brainy.

327
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,955
How did you do that?

328
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,872
And, I assume, Clumsy.

329
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,877
- All good.
- What are you guys doing out here?

330
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,872
We knew you were up to something.

331
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,872
This is all my fault, Hefty.

332
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,034
But, Smurfette, the Forbidden Forest?
It's too dangerous.

333
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,874
I have to at least warn that lost village.

334
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,873
Well, we're Team Smurf,
and we stick together.

335
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,077
So, we're coming with you.

336
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,560
I can't ask you to do that.

337
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,200
- You didn't ask.
- We volunteered.

338
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,240
- Thanks, guys.
- First things first.

339
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,396
Bug technology. Cool.

340
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,437
According to my map, we should be standing

341
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,951
right in front of this
very large, tall stone wall.

342
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,320
Check.

343
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,356
One small step for four small Smurfs...

344
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,591
Okay. Let us proceed.

345
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,480
- Smurfette!
- You okay, Smurfette?

346
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,475
Nice flowers. Nice flowers.

347
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,711
Not nice flowers!

348
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,996
Where's Clumsy?

349
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,912
Hey! We just met! I'm not that kind of Smurf.

350
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,114
Watch out for the steep embankment.

351
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,517
Clumsy, you okay?

352
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,390
I'm seeing stars.

353
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,873
Good work, Clumsy.

354
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,998
You may have discovered
a new subspecies of flying insectoid.

355
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,270
Amazing! A winged, fire-breathing Anisoptera.

356
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,000
Let's see. How should we classify this?

357
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,558
Maybe. I mean, seems like an easy choice,
but I'm just not sure.

358
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,639
Yea, okay, let's go with "dragonfly."
Hopefully more "fly" than "dragon."

359
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,909
Nope! Less "fly!" Less "fly!"

360
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,356
Guys!

361
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,110
I'm okay.

362
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,439
A little help here.

363
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,757
Monty, get off of me.

364
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,914
I hate nature.

365
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,480
How gaudy.

366
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,760
Azrael, do something!

367
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,319
It's quite painful.

368
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,518
Stop laughing. This is not funny.

369
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,436
Watch it!

370
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,956
Let me go!

371
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,599
These nests are made of some material
I've never seen before.

372
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,990
You know, I think I've had enough
of these flying Antipastos for one day.

373
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,076
Hey! What are you doing here?

374
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,436
Well, I was thinking of getting
a little place out here.

375
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,637
Just a quiet place in the forest.

376
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,077
It's a little breezy up on the hill.
What do you think I'm doing out here?

377
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,392
You are never going to find
that village, Gargamel.

378
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,393
Smurfette, if it wasn't for you,

379
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,631
I wouldn't even know
about those other Smurfs.

380
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,478
- Get 'em, boys.
- Smurfintine formation! Go!

381
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,396
- Hey!
- Smurfintine!

382
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,073
- Get 'em, Azrael!
- Smurfintine!

383
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,072
- Smurfintine!
- Smurfintine!

384
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,990
Smurfintine!

385
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,436
Hey, you. You're the clumsy one, right?

386
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,590
Think fast.

387
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,909
I caught it!

388
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,755
This isn't good.

389
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,829
- Clumsy, give 'em back their egg!
- Okay.

390
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,994
Oh, come on!

391
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,390
- Clumsy!
- I'm trying!

392
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,920
I'm really, really sorry, guys!

393
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,876
Over there!

394
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,952
I didn't mean to poach your egg.

395
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,351
Well, they're toast.

396
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,954
It doesn't matter.

397
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,713
What's a few worthless pennies

398
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,271
when there's a pot of gold
at the end of my rainbow?

399
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,036
Trust me, they're goners.

400
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,272
I'm telling you,
they've been fried to a blue crisp.

401
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,874
They're Smurf kabobs.

402
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,189
Smurfberry flambe.

403
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,839
Marshmallows.

404
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,832
Can it, fuzzball. They're dead.

405
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,718
Dead, I say!

406
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,555
Hello?

407
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,839
Smurfette?

408
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,158
Echo!

409
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,358
Darkness. I don't do well in the darkness.
I have enough trouble in the daylight.

410
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,070
Hold on, everyone.
We need to find a way out of here.

411
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,279
That is good thinking, "Brainy."

412
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,192
- Guys?
- Darkness!

413
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,911
Don't be scared. Just...
Just think happy thoughts.

414
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,560
It's not really happy times right now!

415
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,758
- Just stay in the light, Clumsy.
- Too late.

416
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,433
I'm walking into the darkness!

417
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,113
What are you... Why?

418
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,352
I'm really freaking out, you guys!

419
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,397
Stop, everyone.

420
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,997
Okay, go into your backpacks,
get out your emergency tunnel survival kit,

421
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,030
find the small glass vial marked "light,"
and shake it really hard.

422
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,797
Clumsy? How you doing?

423
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,394
Okay, I guess.

424
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,079
Just hang tight, Clumsy.

425
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,836
I'm not sure how long this will take
or how long we'll be down here,

426
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,597
so, everybody, whatever you do,
don't eat all your rations.

427
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,876
I just ate all my rations!

428
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,520
- Clumsy!
- I'm stress-eating!

429
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm coming, Clumsy.

430
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,510
Follow the sound of my voice.

431
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,751
Wait! These tunnels are like a maze.

432
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,480
- We'll just get more lost.
- We gotta do something.

433
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,029
I'm with her. Time for some action.

434
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,112
We're doing this all wrong.

435
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,236
Smurfette!

436
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,437
I'm close, Clumsy. Almost there.

437
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,194
That's just the echo playing tricks on us.

438
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,237
- Anybody?
- I'm here.

439
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,835
I'm here right around this corner.

440
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,434
Hey, everybody?

441
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,992
My light is going out.

442
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,710
That is it! I'm punching us out of here.

443
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,195
It's collapsing.

444
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,830
Hefty! Put those fists away
before you get us killed!

445
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,991
At least I'm trying something.

446
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,555
- I'm gonna blow us out of here!
- No!

447
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,199
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't!

448
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,430
Too late!

449
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,352
Clumsy?

450
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,673
- Hey, Smurfette.
- Clumsy!

451
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,112
Hang on. I'm coming, Clumsy bro.

452
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,795
I got you, little buddy.

453
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,755
Yeah!

454
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,880
Stampede!

455
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,752
I think my rations are coming up.

456
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,240
What? What's so funny?

457
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,630
Now, that's what I call
"talking out of your butt."

458
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,156
Oh, boys.

459
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,916
Would anyone be interested in knowing
that we're in sight of three tall trees?

460
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,070
- All right.
- Yeah, we are.

461
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,153
And Bucky is gonna get us there extra fast.

462
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,436
- Bucky?
- Seems like a Bucky to me.

463
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,349
Hit it, Bucky!

464
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,990
Smurfette?

465
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,550
Before you say anything, just listen.

466
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,276
Now, I know yesterday I might have been
a bit tough on you and the boys,

467
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,194
and I know there are times
I'm a little overprotective.

468
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,358
Okay, a lot overprotective.

469
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,274
But you have to understand, you snuck out.

470
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,113
You have to be more careful.

471
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,752
Smurfette, I know lately you may not realize,

472
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,912
and I may not say it enough, but you are...

473
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,554
You shine.

474
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,713
So, anyway, we're smurfy?

475
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,912
I think you and the boys
have been grounded long enough.

476
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,915
Smurfette?

477
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,520
Okay. I'm opening the door.

478
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,275
And I'm walking in to talk more.

479
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,750
You there?

480
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,400
Smurfette.

481
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,276
Hefty!

482
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,430
Brainy!

483
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,515
Clumsy! That's not even convincing.

484
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,834
When I find those Smurfs, I will ground them
for a month of blue moons.

485
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,071
What's going on in here?

486
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,712
Well, all right.

487
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,351
Have you ever seen something so beautiful?

488
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,393
Every day, Smurfette. Every day.

489
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,631
- Don't be weird.
- You don't be weird.

490
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,714
We can camp here for the night.

491
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,029
I'll start us a fire.

492
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,755
Fetch me some firewood, would you, Hefty?

493
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,877
A "please" would be nice.

494
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,071
Yes, it would, but I haven't
earned my manners badge,

495
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,560
so get me some firewood.

496
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,518
Clumsy? You okay?

497
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,069
Yeah, sure. It's been fun.

498
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,358
Well, not tons of fun,
but it's had its moments.

499
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,874
Kind of.

500
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,714
You know what I'm trying to say.

501
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,792
It hasn't been that much fun.

502
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,152
Well done, Hefty. Well done.

503
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,395
All right, step one,

504
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,632
the wood should be stacked
into a tepee-like structure.

505
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,677
Step two, I tap this flint with a rock and...

506
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,197
You're not even blowing on it.
You're spitting on it.

507
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,392
That's odd. Perhaps the wood
you collected was damp, Hefty.

508
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,517
According to my manual,
it should spark right up.

509
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,429
Hey, I've got an idea.

510
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,879
No, no, no. No, no!
No! No, no, no. No, no, no!

511
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,954
You know, you're right, Brain Man.
Your little book does come in handy.

512
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,636
Shame. Shame on you.
We'd be lost without this book.

513
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,792
My name is Brainy. I'm super smart.
I'm the smart Smurf.

514
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,519
But I can't start a fire.

515
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,312
Okay, the damage is minimal.
The binding's still intact.

516
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,232
It smells good.

517
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,074
Just think, guys.

518
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,720
After all this time,

519
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,833
while we've been going about
our smurfy business back home,

520
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,038
there's been other Smurfs out there,
just like us.

521
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,238
Or they could be nothing like us.

522
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,996
He's right.
We should be prepared for whatever we find.

523
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,152
Those other Smurfs might not even be blue.

524
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,197
Maybe they'll be orange.

525
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,519
I like orange.

526
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,876
What if they all wear glasses?

527
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,031
Or have big, bushy mustaches.

528
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,000
What if they have scaly skin and sharp teeth?

529
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,477
And giant claws. And big, beady eyes.

530
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,473
What if they have hands?

531
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,949
Good one, bro.

532
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,151
Listen, it doesn't matter
what they look like.

533
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,754
We still have to warn them.

534
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,113
Gargamel's wrong about me.

535
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,032
It's not my purpose to help him.

536
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,715
I'm meant to save those Smurfs.

537
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,994
And we're gonna help you.

538
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,198
We're Team Smurf, and we're in this together.

539
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,555
And by "together," I mean me and you.

540
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,155
And those guys. But mostly me and you.

541
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,835
Okay, everyone. Smurfy selfie time.

542
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,119
- Say, "Blue cheese."
- Blue cheese!

543
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,158
According to the map,
we should be arriving at a river.

544
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,116
Check.

545
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,515
It's like a workout for my eyeballs.

546
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,513
Okay, Bucky, let's see how fast you can swim.

547
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,360
Come on, boy.

548
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,355
You can do it.

549
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,310
What's a little water?

550
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,550
Hey.

551
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,356
What's that, Bucky?

552
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,877
The river's unsafe and full
of dangerous surprises at every bend?

553
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,753
No. I didn't get any of that.

554
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,478
Perhaps Glowbunnies don't swim.

555
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,950
That's too bad.
We'd get there so much faster.

556
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,430
Fear not, my intrepid Team Smurf.

557
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,600
I didn't earn this raft-building merit badge
for nothing.

558
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,079
- Nailed it.
- Impressive, Brainy.

559
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,674
Here.

560
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,512
Stylish and practical.

561
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,473
Now, let's launch this bad boy.

562
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,554
Wait. Remember, this strange river
may hold untold surprises.

563
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,155
- We must be cautious.
- Cautious. Good point.

564
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,833
- And heave...
- Wait.

565
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,719
The currents can be unpredictable.
We must be alert and vigilant.

566
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,712
Vigilance? Good call.

567
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,996
- Now, on three, two...
- Wait!

568
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,434
We must make sure we always...

569
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,396
Pay attention to the...

570
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,316
Rate of speed of the...

571
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,876
Okay, and we are off.

572
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,519
Heave-ho!

573
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,634
- Bye, Bucky.
- Thanks for your help.

574
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,598
- Don't worry, we'll be fine.
- Bye, little Bucky bro.

575
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,433
- <i>Hasta la</i> bunny.
- See you on the way back!

576
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,199
Hey. What is this thing?

577
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,033
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

578
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,317
Now all I want to do is touch it.

579
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,553
At this pace,
Gargamel doesn't stand a chance.

580
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,156
Look. If we follow this river,
we'll be right on course.

581
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,800
Right on course. To the end of our rainbow.

582
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,191
Smurfs? I thought I left you for dead.

583
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,839
Hang on, Smurf Crew.

584
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,830
Gun it!

585
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,870
What the...

586
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,069
No.

587
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,674
Stop ruining things.

588
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,831
Ruining things is my thing.

589
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,910
What?

590
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,673
Azrael, get me a bigger stick.

591
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,200
Oh, dear.

592
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,399
Clumsy, pull the lever!

593
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,154
Seriously? But you said not to.
Is this a trick?

594
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,515
Pull it now!

595
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,710
Oh, no.

596
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,190
What's this?

597
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,639
Azrael! Do something. It's never gonna stop.

598
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,191
Make the log stop spinning.
This river is killing me.

599
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,315
Look out!

600
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,629
I love you two.

601
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,194
- Yes! We did it!
- We did it!

602
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,636
- See, I always believed we would do it.
- Take that!

603
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,996
Help! Help!

604
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,436
All right. We're still on course.

605
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,749
Double-time it, Hefty.

606
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,154
Help! I'm sinking!
Please. I'm afraid of turtles!

607
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,199
Guys, what's he up to now?

608
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,999
- Help!
- Forget that guy.

609
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,719
My cat can't swim.

610
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,359
We gotta help him.

611
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,275
- Are you crazy? Why?
- Because it's what I do.

612
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,319
- Listen to him!
- But he's our sworn enemy.

613
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,119
He is literally a villain.

614
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,634
I can change!

615
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,838
And I literally wear my heart
on my sleeve, okay?

616
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,475
- That's your shoulder, not a sleeve.
- I like your tattoo!

617
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,439
- We're doing this.
- Smurfette, talk some sense into him.

618
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,154
Brainy, I hate Gargamel more than anyone,
but we're Smurfs.

619
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,800
- We do the right thing.
- Thank goodness for it!

620
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,200
And we have to save him.

621
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,079
I just want to go on record
that I'm decisively against this.

622
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,232
- Whatever. We're doing it.
- Sounds awesome!

623
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,117
- Use this.
- Grab on!

624
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,039
I don't know about this.

625
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,032
You won't regret it.

626
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,551
Thank you. Thank you. Such a kind Smurf.

627
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,836
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

628
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,709
Wet, a little tired, kind of waterlogged.
Thanks for asking, but...

629
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,154
I'm still evil, so...

630
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,920
Enjoy drowning.

631
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,552
Hope you're better swimmers
than you are judges of wizards' character.

632
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,996
Brainy. Hefty?

633
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,110
You okay?

634
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,594
Define "okay."

635
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,034
- Where's Clumsy?
- Clumsy!

636
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,679
- Clumsy! Clumsy!
- Clumsy! Clumsy!

637
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,959
I'm good.

638
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,875
- Run away! Run away!
- Hey. I think.

639
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,155
My pack! My manual!
No! No, no, no! No, no, no!

640
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,550
My Scout manual!

641
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,114
This is all your fault!

642
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,630
- What?
- Brainy, cut it out.

643
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,315
I'm sorry. Correction.
This is your fault, too.

644
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,436
Leave her out of this.

645
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,432
Hefty, I don't need you
to fight my fights for me.

646
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,318
Wait, now you're mad at me, too?

647
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,314
Smurfette, you're the one that got us
into this whole mess in the first place.

648
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,790
Hey, I was ready to do this on my own.

649
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,270
Great. So much for Team Smurf.

650
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,353
- I want to yell about something!
- Stay out of this, Clumsy.

651
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,239
That's it, Brain Man.
It's time for you to earn your manners badge.

652
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,470
Stop it!

653
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,036
Take cover!

654
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,953
Who are you? What do you want?

655
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,076
Her.

656
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,393
- Move.
- Smurfette!

657
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,040
- What should we do with her?
- Look at that hair.

658
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,389
- Where's she from?
- And that dress.

659
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,230
It's you.

660
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,993
You're a girl.

661
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,835
She's a girl.

662
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,112
This is her.
This is the Smurf I was telling you about.

663
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,675
The one from the wall?

664
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,672
She's real?

665
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,915
I'm Smurflily.

666
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,118
Hi. I'm Smurfette.

667
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,760
Oh, my geez-to-petes! I'm Smurfblossom.

668
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,752
Nice to meet you. We don't have a Smurfette.

669
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,111
But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover,

670
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,759
Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy,
Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...

671
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,956
Hey.

672
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,838
Everyone can just introduce themselves later.

673
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,435
Look at you. You're so different.

674
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,113
I mean, sorry, but it's true.

675
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,590
Do you know how to start a fire
with just rope and a stick?

676
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,798
I do. I can show you.
Actually, Smurfstorm can show you.

677
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,395
She's the best at that kind of thing.
Right, Stormy?

678
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,996
That means "yes."

679
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,470
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
What about a double rainbow?

680
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,473
What about an upside down rainbow?

681
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,630
So, is your favorite song...

682
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,191
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

683
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,715
'Cause mine is. Your dress is so pretty.

684
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,793
Smurfblossom, remember,
work on that filter, okay?

685
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,515
- Right. Filter, filter.
- What's your deal anyway?

686
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,474
Well, we came to warn you about Gargamel.

687
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,880
- Garga?
- Garga?

688
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,996
Garga-what?

689
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,595
He's a dangerous wizard
who wants to capture all Smurfs

690
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,592
and use them for his evil magic.

691
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,672
And he knows about your lost village.

692
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,194
"Lost village"?

693
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,751
You're the ones who are lost, not us.

694
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,595
We have to take you to Smurfy Grove.

695
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,957
What do we do with these blue blobs?

696
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,150
Bring them along.

697
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,550
Come on, Smurfette.
I'm gonna show you my room.

698
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,518
You can tell me all about Gargasmell.

699
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,239
But first, do you want to hear
my favorite song again?

700
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,710
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

701
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,200
All right, move.

702
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,552
- Girl Smurfs mean business.
- You got that right.

703
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,793
Open the gate!

704
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,120
The girls are back!

705
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,390
Where did they find them?

706
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,399
Is there something wrong with them?

707
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,676
- Are they sick?
- Are they food?

708
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,070
No, no, no. They're Smurfs, just like us.

709
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,800
Except, well, they're boy Smurfs.

710
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,591
"Boy." That's a funny word.
Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy.

711
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,434
Look at me. I'm a boy Smurf.

712
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,990
- I like 'em.
- Where do they come from?

713
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,434
- What is that?
- Look at their hair.

714
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,715
- You can see their tails.
- Look.

715
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,314
- Hey, watch it!
- Brainy's log, day two.

716
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,800
We've encountered a rare new life-form.

717
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,996
Are there more like you?

718
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,639
They are at times very intimidating.

719
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,235
- Are you gonna stay here?
- And they smell nice.

720
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,959
- Hello, boy.
- More on that later.

721
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,394
- I want one!
- Boundaries!

722
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,995
Okay, that... That's enough of that!

723
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,039
They're my friends.
That's Hefty, Brainy and Clumsy.

724
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,874
- Hey, there!
- Hooptie, Berney, Klutzy. Got it.

725
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,155
We should do name tags.

726
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,471
Wait, where are your boys?

727
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,876
You won't find any boys here.

728
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,798
I am Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.

729
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,436
This is called an introduction.
So, now, you go.

730
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,510
- I...
- Don't get too close, Willow.

731
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,319
Something's not right here.

732
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,869
I promise we're only here to help.

733
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,879
We came to warn you
about the evil wizard, Gargamel.

734
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,397
He has a map with a landmark
leading him to three tall trees.

735
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,676
- Show 'em, Brainy.
- Snappy.

736
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,557
Don't try any funny stuff, bug.

737
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,477
I hate to break it to you,
but those aren't trees.

738
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,953
They're waterfalls.

739
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,872
Gargamel's going the wrong way.

740
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,638
And if he went there,
then that means the Swamp of No Return.

741
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,951
There's no way he could survive.

742
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,593
Help me! Help me!

743
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,713
There's no way I'll survive!

744
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,153
With all due respect,
you don't know Gargamel.

745
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,280
Yeah, well, with no due respect,
you don't know us.

746
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,238
Trust us, he's a goner.

747
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,109
Stormy, why don't you do a little recon?
Check things out.

748
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,479
And leave you here with these four?
No way. Look at that one.

749
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,120
He can't be normal.

750
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,237
I think we'll be just fine here.

751
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,630
Spitfire!

752
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,200
Okay. So, what does this Gargamel look like?

753
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,114
You know, he's your typical wizard.

754
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,591
Long black robe,
lives alone with his cat and his bird.

755
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,194
It's sad, really.

756
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,351
You're coming with me. You can point him out.

757
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,830
Hey. There's no way he's getting on a...

758
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,670
I feel the need to remind you,
my name is Clumsy.

759
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,874
Clumsy!

760
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,236
Don't worry. Clumsy's in good hands.

761
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,597
Stormy is the sweetest, in her own way.

762
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,276
All right, girls, in the meantime,
our guests have had a long journey,

763
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,156
so let's show them some hospitality,
Smurfy Grove style.

764
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,556
Come on.

765
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,150
Go.

766
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,432
Hey, Smurfette, check this out.

767
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,590
Come on!

768
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,075
Flap, Monty. Flap vigorously.

769
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,154
Use your mighty condor wings
to carry your master to safety.

770
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,870
Sweet mercy, they're bottom feeders!

771
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,876
Devil fish!

772
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,199
Where is my lost Smurf village?

773
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,349
What? Smurfs!

774
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,710
Why won't they just die?

775
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,110
Monty, retrieve them!

776
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,319
He exists, all right.
He and his stinky cat and his dodo bird.

777
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,120
They've been terrorizing us
the entire journey.

778
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,919
He didn't like us from the start.

779
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,798
He never could find our village.

780
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,475
So then he made a plan to capture us all,

781
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,950
and that's when Gargamel created Smurfette.

782
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,394
- Anyways...
- Hold up.

783
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,393
Smurfette was created by this Gargamel?

784
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,518
Yeah. From a lump of clay.
Really cool story, actually.

785
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,398
I knew I didn't trust her.

786
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,358
You'd like her if you get to know her.

787
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,911
She's just like you, but nice.

788
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,912
Hold on. We got a bogey coming in.

789
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,759
That's no bogey.
That's Gargamel's big dumb bird!

790
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,309
Here, you fly.

791
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,791
That's not a great idea.
Flying's not really my thing.

792
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,360
Have you ever flown before?

793
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,920
Well, no.

794
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,071
Well, then how do you know
it's not your thing?

795
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,875
He's coming back.

796
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,679
- What do I...
- Hurry!

797
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,876
What do I do now?

798
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,156
Good move!

799
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,079
- Now, do it again!
- Okay.

800
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,429
Thanks.

801
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,840
Yes. Wait a minute.

802
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,955
I don't recognize that other Smurf.

803
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,269
They found my lost Smurf village.

804
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,275
Hey, I've got an idea.

805
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,875
Spitfire, spit fire!

806
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,958
I like the way you think.

807
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,272
I guess I'm pretty good
with dragonflies after all.

808
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,389
Monty!

809
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,359
What have they done to you,
my glorious bird of prey?

810
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,520
Smurfs!

811
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,558
Shiatsu or Swedish?

812
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,510
Probably Swedish.

813
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,113
So, about all that stuff
I said back at the beach...

814
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,760
I guess I kind of overreacted.

815
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,752
Yeah. Me, too.

816
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,911
So, we good?

817
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,231
- Yeah, we're good.
- Hey, guys.

818
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,592
Isn't this place awesome?

819
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,480
Doesn't she look great?

820
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,472
It's like she's one of us now.

821
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,677
She should stay with us forever.

822
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,517
One, she always looks great.

823
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,037
And two, this is getting
a little out of hand, don't you think?

824
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,589
Sorry. I can't take you seriously
with that mask on your face.

825
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,959
Hey, Smurfette, we did
what we came here to do.

826
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,679
These Smurfs know about Gargamel.

827
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,673
So, come on, let's start
thinking about heading home.

828
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,750
Home?

829
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,150
But I...

830
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,475
It's time to go.

831
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,669
Smurfette?

832
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,513
Incoming!

833
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,675
Turns out I do do well with dragonflies.

834
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,959
They were right. This Gargamel character,
he's real, and he's headed this way.

835
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,872
Oh, no. See? I told you...

836
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,679
Put a cork in it, Smurfette.

837
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,071
The way I see it, you and your little
boyfriends led him straight to us.

838
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,629
But, of course,
that was your plan all along, wasn't it?

839
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,315
Smurfstorm, easy.

840
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,234
Little Miss Yellow Hair
isn't even a real Smurf.

841
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:03,190
She was created by Gargamel.
The Clumsy blob told me so himself.

842
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,470
What?

843
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,120
Smurfette, is that true?

844
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,357
It's not like that.

845
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,716
She was made to help him find Smurfs.

846
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,554
Smurfette came here to help you. We all did.

847
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,599
It's okay, Hefty. This is all my fault.

848
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,719
Girls, protection mode.

849
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,880
Come on, bro, let's help.

850
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,314
Isn't this exciting?

851
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,916
Hold.

852
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,510
Hold.

853
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,350
Now!

854
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,034
Surrender, wizard.

855
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,713
What? Wizard?

856
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,360
He's so old.

857
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,033
- Is he wearing a disguise?
- Look at his face.

858
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,600
This is impossible.

859
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,273
He doesn't seem so tough.

860
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,671
Yeah, Gargamel! That's what you get
when you attack Smurfy Grove.

861
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,390
- Gargamel? What are you talking about?
- No, no, no, wait. This is a mistake.

862
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,630
- What?
- Smurfette?

863
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,040
That's Papa.

864
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,952
- Papa?
- Papa?

865
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,633
There's another funny word.

866
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,519
Papa. Papa. Papa!

867
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,239
Smurfblossom, no.

868
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,994
Breathe deep
and step away from the Papa-thing.

869
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,675
Everyone, meet Papa Smurf.

870
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,994
Hey.

871
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,072
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm Smurfjade.

872
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,834
Where are the boys?

873
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,640
- 'Sup, Papa?
- Hello there.

874
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,995
I rode a dragonfly!

875
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,790
Well, thank goodness you're all okay.

876
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,712
How did you find us?

877
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,190
I wasn't born yesterday, you know.

878
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,674
Yeah, that's clear.

879
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,310
Look, you four are coming home with me. Now.

880
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,880
Not so fast, Papa-thing.

881
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,032
"Papa-thing"? Are you the one in charge here?

882
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,431
That's right.
I'm Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.

883
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,239
I'm afraid that's quite impossible,

884
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,073
because I happen to be
the leader of the Smurfs.

885
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,958
Whatever you say, Papa-thing.

886
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,316
Excuse me, do you mind not calling me that?

887
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,437
Well, if the thing fits...

888
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,274
By the way, where'd you learn those moves?

889
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,714
Self-taught, actually.

890
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,029
Impressive.

891
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,110
Thank you.

892
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,192
You're quite welcome.

893
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,715
Okay, not really sure what's happening here,

894
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,757
but what about Gargamel?

895
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,480
What? What is all this talk about Garga...

896
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,276
Gargamel!

897
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,670
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

898
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,036
- No!
- I hope so.

899
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,719
- Everybody run!
- Arm yourselves!

900
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,315
Prepare for Garmageddon!

901
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,316
This way!

902
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,553
Spears, now!

903
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,677
Gargamel says freeze!

904
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,915
That's right. Smurf-tested,
Gargamel-approved,

905
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,391
grade-A, first-class,
high-octane freeze balls.

906
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,115
Freeze ball! Freeze ball!
Freeze ball! Freeze ball!

907
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,270
Look out!

908
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,472
Well, I assume they'll still work
if I don't shout "freeze ball,"

909
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,279
but we'll never know.

910
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,397
- Freeze ball!
- Smurfette!

911
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,149
- Hefty.
- It's over, Smurfette.

912
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,193
Monty, bag o' Smurfs.

913
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,955
It's time for you to run.

914
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,952
- No!
- Three more for pickup.

915
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,800
Smurfette. My little creation.

916
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,952
You finally did what you were made for.

917
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,271
No. It's not true.

918
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,550
Of course it is.

919
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,472
Why do you think you led me here?

920
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,792
Why do you think you saved me on the river?

921
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,714
It was all part of the plan.

922
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:26,396
No matter how hard you try,
you can't escape your destiny.

923
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,916
And now, you're really
of no use to me anymore.

924
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,480
Freeze ball!

925
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:39,670
Yes, these freeze balls
only work on real Smurfs.

926
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,753
And you are nothing more than a lump of clay.

927
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,913
Thank you for everything.

928
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,517
Smurfette? How could you do this to us?

929
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,910
Because it was her purpose.

930
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:43,033
<i>Smurfy Thing Finder for four small Smurfs.</i>

931
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,399
I'm sorry, you guys.

932
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,870
No, Snappy.
I've done too much damage already.

933
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,874
<i>We're Team Smurf, and we're in this together.</i>

934
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,156
<i>We're Smurfs. We do the right thing.</i>

935
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,037
I'm not even a real Smurf.

936
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,879
I'm not a real Smurf.

937
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,549
We need more power!

938
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,557
Faster, Monty. Faster.

939
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,869
Yes.

940
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,553
The jiggler's jiggling.

941
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,393
The spinny thing is spinning.

942
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,709
The smoke is going up.

943
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,473
The bubblers are bubbling.

944
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,750
Perfect!

945
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,957
It's almost there.

946
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,151
Just keep running, old bird.

947
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,114
Here's what we're going to do.

948
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,510
- I pick this lock.
- Yeah?

949
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,956
- We swing to that shelf.
- Yeah?

950
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,032
- Pick up something heavy.
- Yeah?

951
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,396
And use it to kill the bird!

952
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,755
- Yeah! What?
- Yeah! Wait.

953
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,718
You want us to kill the bird?

954
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,951
Fine. We'll just knock him unconscious.

955
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,480
- Genius!
- All right, then.

956
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,710
Let's do this.

957
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,793
They have an escape plan,
but they're going to need our help.

958
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,513
It's time to rock the cage.

959
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,034
Don't be weird.

960
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:01,910
Yes!

961
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,154
Okay. Now!

962
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,800
Stop that, Azrael.

963
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,839
I can't calibrate my machine
with all your incessant yammering.

964
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,634
Yes, Azrael, listen to it.
It purrs like a kitten.

965
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:40,155
Look at that. Everything is in sync.
Yes, yes. Good.

966
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,911
Sweet mercy! It's another jailbreak!

967
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,311
- No, Gargamel. No.
- Quiet down.

968
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,238
You'll all get your turn.

969
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,515
In you go!

970
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,156
No!

971
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,116
Yes, that's the stuff.

972
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,880
<i>It's working, it's working, it's working</i>

973
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,279
I can feel it. I can feel the power.

974
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,509
Check out my wizard mane.

975
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,034
Really, man?

976
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,915
When I'm through with these Smurfs,
I'll have all the power I've ever dreamed of!

977
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,476
Almost all the power.

978
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,910
Smurfette.

979
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,038
Smurfette, what a lovely surprise.

980
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,430
Are you done crying in the woods?

981
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,400
I've shed enough tears for those Smurfs.

982
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,470
What's this?

983
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,473
I'm done pretending to be something I'm not.

984
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,077
I've come to repledge my loyalty to you,
my true Papa.

985
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,515
- Impossible.
- She can't be serious.

986
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,193
No, no, no, she would never.

987
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,478
Even if I did believe you, which I don't,

988
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,553
what could you possibly offer me
that I don't already have?

989
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,678
A tiny little massage that I can't even feel?

990
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,753
How about the rest of the Smurfs?

991
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,991
Yeah, right. Wait, what?

992
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:31,600
Just think of all the power you'll have
once I reveal the location of Smurf Village.

993
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,079
Let's see now.

994
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,311
One hundred more Smurfs,
that's ten times the power...

995
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,676
No. If you carry the one...

996
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,672
Whatever. It's a lot more power.

997
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,719
Now, why are you doing this?

998
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,514
I'm so tired of being good.

999
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,435
Use your power to transform me
back to my evil self.

1000
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,191
Your loyalty has returned to you.

1001
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,272
So, do we have a deal?

1002
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,874
Smurfette, no!

1003
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,600
Quiet, you vile blue rats. I'm thinking.

1004
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,756
Okay, I'm done. Let's do it.

1005
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,356
One evil Smurfette coming right up!

1006
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,632
Wait. Of course!

1007
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,390
What? What's happening?

1008
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,631
No! No!

1009
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,035
What are you doing?

1010
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,917
Yeah! Go, Smurfette!

1011
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,313
Azrael, help! More power!

1012
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,913
What are we going to do?

1013
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,156
Bingo. We Smurfboard.

1014
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,195
Team Smurf!

1015
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,794
Payback time.

1016
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,000
No!

1017
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,316
Smurfintine! Smurfintine!

1018
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,513
I'm okay. Yeah!

1019
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,640
I thought we were goners.

1020
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,393
All right. Everybody. Thank goodness.

1021
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,073
- All right!
- I'm okay!

1022
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,834
She did it! She did it!

1023
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,240
Where's Smurfette?

1024
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,150
Hey.

1025
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,430
Smurfette?

1026
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,915
What happened?

1027
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,672
This is what she once was.

1028
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,160
No. No, no, no.

1029
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,312
There's gotta be something I can do.
There's gotta be a spell.

1030
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,880
There's gotta be something. I know there is.

1031
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,873
Where is it? What page? Must be here.

1032
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,112
"Alchemy, vanishing, lead into gold."
No, that's not it.

1033
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,192
- Papa.
- Which spell? Which spell?

1034
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,839
Papa.

1035
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,391
We won't find the answer to this in a book.

1036
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,799
Let's take her home.

1037
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,155
She never thought she was a real Smurf.

1038
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,914
But she was the truest Smurf of all.

1039
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,317
Why is everyone crying?

1040
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,232
It's Smurfette.

1041
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,277
She's a lump of clay.

1042
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,671
No, Clumsy, it's me. I'm right here.

1043
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,120
Smurfette?

1044
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,520
It's Smurfette. It's Smurfette!

1045
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,320
- Quiet, Clumsy.
- Let him be, Brainy.

1046
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,596
We all grieve in our own way.

1047
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,435
- She's here!
- Poor little bro. I know how he feels.

1048
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,079
Yeah!

1049
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,310
Smurfette!

1050
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,392
Hefty, not you, too.

1051
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,959
You're all right!

1052
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,152
Don't ever do that to me again.

1053
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,516
I won't. I promise.

1054
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,914
Yes, yes, yes!

1055
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,394
You never cease to amaze me.

1056
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,313
<i>So, as for that burning question...</i>

1057
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,119
What's a Smurfette?

1058
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,272
Well, I don't need a book
to tell you she's...

1059
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,919
Right.

1060
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,232
Smurfette can't be defined by just one word.

1061
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,834
She's many things.

1062
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,799
She doesn't know it yet,
but she's my new best friend.

1063
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,190
Smurfette is a bunny wrangler.

1064
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,794
She's tough.

1065
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,554
Not as tough as me, but tough enough.

1066
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:06,319
Smurfette can be anything she wants to be.

1067
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,916
- What's going on in there?
- Goodbye!

1068
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,233
Say, "Blue cheese!"

1069
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,515
Blue cheese!

1070
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,600
<i>I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs,</i>
<i>and you ruined everything.</i>

1071
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,990
<i>I knew I should have gotten a dog</i>
<i>from the shelter.</i>

1072
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,597
<i>I'm not saying this to be cruel, okay?</i>
<i>I'm saying it to be constructive.</i>

1073
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,712
<i>You're a useless feline.</i>

1074
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,710
<i>That's just mean. That's mean.</i>
<i>There was a line, and you crossed it.</i>

1075
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:35,189
<i>I was just jib-jabbing,</i>
<i>and you crossed that line, and that stung.</i>

1076
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,634
<i>I demand an apology.</i>

1077
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,510
<i>You were going to learn this</i>
<i>one way or another,</i>

1078
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,638
<i>but I am not your real father.</i>

1079
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,714
<i>But that doesn't matter now.</i>
<i>What matters is destroying the Smurfs.</i>

1080
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,951
<i>Any thoughts? I mean, I have thoughts.</i>

1081
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,072
<i>But I always like to spitball</i>
<i>off of your thoughts.</i>

1082
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,235
<i>Azrael, I'm not going to sugarcoat this.</i>
<i>Your ideas are terrible.</i>

1083
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,271
<i>I can't think with this music.</i>

1084
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,159
<i>Can someone please shut off the music?</i>

1085
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:10,473
<i>And what's with all these words</i>
<i>scrolling in front of me?</i>

1086
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,672
<i>Did the Smurfs do this</i>
<i>so that I would be distracted</i>

1087
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,195
<i>and not be able to destroy them as easily?</i>

1088
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,633
<i>"Matte painters"?</i>
<i>I don't even know what that means.</i>

1089
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,200
<i>Someone just made that up, right?</i>

1090
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,880
<i>I feel sorry for whoever "Matte" is.</i>

1091
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,759
<i>"Look development artists"?</i>

1092
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,196
<i>Yes, of course, let's develop some looks.</i>

1093
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:35,036
<i>Like maybe a really angry look,</i>
<i>because you two totally ruined my plans.</i>

1094
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,193
<i>Am I going mad, Azrael?</i>

1095
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,318
<i>For the last time,</i>
<i>get them to shut off this music!</i>

1095
01:26:42,305 --> 01:27:42,293
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
