2
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:09,468
I wish to report, sir,

3
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:12,168
a small boat met the Pharaon,
three leagues off the island.

4
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:15,167
I delivered the letter into
the hands of Captain Leclere.

5
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,174
They say the king is prepared for war.

6
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:19,774
So is the emperor.

7
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,716
Maintain the pump and gather oil!

8
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:35,945
Aye, aye!

9
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:43,163
Man the main topsail!

10
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,990
Man the topsail!

11
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,253
Here, Captain, take these.

12
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:49,081
No. No more pills.

13
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:55,305
Will I reach port as captain or...

14
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,134
...fish bait?

15
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,051
- Well, sir, your fever, uh--
- Yes, I know I have a fever.

16
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:04,271
- Where's Dantes?
- He's coming, sir.

17
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,841
Standby to carry the deck cargo!

18
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:15,369
That cargo? It's worth
12,051 francs and 30 cents!

19
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,936
What good is it if the ship goes down?

20
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,635
If Captain Leclere was on that,
the ship wouldn't go down!

21
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,115
And as long as I'm super-cargo
on this ship--

22
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,248
You'll stay off the quarterdeck!

23
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,573
Captain Leclere wants to see you.

24
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:28,077
The doctor said to come at once!

25
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,003
He thinks I'm going to die.

26
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:45,225
For the first time in 20 years,
he's right.

27
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,268
No, he isn't, sir.

28
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,838
You wouldn't leave me in command
for the first time

29
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,927
with a storm like this
on my hands, now, would you?

30
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,582
The old ship knows your hand
on the wheel.

31
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,974
She'll obey you.

32
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:58,281
But he wants to throw
the deck cargo overboard!

33
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:02,546
Can't be two captains
on one ship, Danglars.

34
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:07,421
I want to talk to Dantes alone.

35
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:16,343
I'm giving my last command as captain.

36
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:22,827
Deliver this to a man you will see.

37
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,917
He's expecting the captain
of the Pharaon

38
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,397
to bring it to him.

39
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,010
But who is he, sir?
There's-- There's no address.

40
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:34,709
He'll make himself known to you
by one word:

41
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,276
Elba.

42
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:38,886
Elba?

43
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:46,590
Sounds pretty heavy.
How is it up there?

44
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,766
Blowing up for a hurricane, sir.

45
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,041
There!

46
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:49,436
King's magistrate's not so
hungry this morning.

47
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,613
The guillotine will send him
only 10 heads for breakfast.

48
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:55,529
They've done nothing to deserve
having their heads chopped off.

49
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:58,140
Nothing except love
their exiled emperor

50
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,011
who always protected 'em.

51
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,535
Watch your mouth.

52
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,450
They'll have your head
in the basket, too.

53
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,888
Find out what that's about.

54
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,727
The Pharaon's been sighted.
She's coming in now.

55
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,731
See? I told you heaven was
with our cause.

56
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:27,387
Very soon, gentlemen, every
loyal follower of Napoleon

57
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,041
will be able to raise his head
once more.

58
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,435
Will you meet the ship
and contact Leclere?

59
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,089
Oh! Oh, no!

60
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,439
The-- the king's magistrate
might meet the ship, too.

61
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:39,964
I can't afford to have him
catch sight of me, can I?

62
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:42,576
No, no, I must remain in hiding here

63
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,664
until after sunset.

64
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,013
Stop right here, Marcel.

65
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,713
You may enjoy mingling
with these fishwives. I don't.

66
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:51,802
I'll wait for you in Fernand's office.

67
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,674
You may run along to this sailor.

68
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,937
- But without my consent.
- Yes, Mother.

69
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,686
Clear up the main and mizzen royals!

70
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:06,948
Steady as she goes.

71
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:08,906
Leclere dead?

72
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,950
Excuse me.

73
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,083
Good morning, Mr. Morrel.

74
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,260
Good morning, Mme de Rosas.
I thought you'd be here.

75
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,393
- That is the Pharaon, isn't it?
- Yes.

76
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,874
What can a mother do
with a daughter? Nothing!

77
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,092
You're an official.

78
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:23,530
You've got to stop
this sailor business.

79
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,421
Can't you refuse to have
the Pharaon enter the harbor?

80
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,925
Send it to another port?
Have it sink? Or something.

81
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,624
I'm collector of customs,
not ruler of the sea.

82
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,887
Well, it's a custom
I'm talking about, a bad custom!

83
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,237
A lady in love with a sailor.

84
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,500
It's merely a young girl's
infatuation.

85
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,241
She sees a hero in Dantes.

86
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,547
And what does she see in you?

87
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,331
A man who protests loudly
that he loves her

88
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:43,414
and does nothing about it.

89
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,919
The Pharaon is flying
the captain's pennant

90
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:46,944
at half-mast.

91
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,729
That means Leclere is dead.

92
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:50,295
He was ill before he left.

93
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,708
I was afraid he wouldn't
last out the voyage.

94
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:52,994
Well, what about the letter?

95
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,213
We arranged before he sailed
if he got worse

96
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,085
to transfer the letter
to his first mate.

97
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:58,695
And that's a man name, uh, Dantes.

98
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,349
Well, well, well,
whatever his name is,

99
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:02,438
keep a close eye on him
and let me know

100
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,981
when he gets to a place
where it'll be safe

101
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,005
for me to meet him.

102
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,153
Thank you, Edmond,

103
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,112
for bringing the ship safely home.

104
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:27,550
- I wish Captain Leclere hadn't--
- He died at sea.

105
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,944
- A sailor doesn't ask for more.
- No, sir.

106
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,774
- You stopped off Elba?
- Yes, sir.

107
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:34,817
There was a letter?

108
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,473
Why? What do you know about it?

109
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,344
What do you know about it?

110
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,129
Nothing, sir, except that
Captain Leclere

111
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,870
gave it to me to deliver to some man.

112
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:44,698
He said he'd make himself known to me.

113
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,917
Let him find you, Edmond.

114
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,093
Marseilles is full
of the king's spies.

115
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,313
Well, that hardly concerns me,
does it, sir?

116
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,837
I'm only carrying out
the captain's orders.

117
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,423
Would you like to
go over the log with me?

118
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,667
While you keep the most
beautiful lady in Marseilles

119
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:58,711
waiting on the dock?

120
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:00,409
On the dock?

121
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:03,934
I'll be here when you come back,
Captain Dantes.

122
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:06,197
- Captain?
- Yes, Captain Dantes.

123
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,939
From now on, you're in command
of the Pharaon.

124
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,420
Oh, sir!

125
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,378
You keep that enthusiasm for her.

126
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:14,422
Yes, sir.

127
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,221
I was afraid that-- that--

128
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,527
That I had forgotten you?

129
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,572
Yes.

130
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,575
You really ought to, you know?

131
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:37,751
What if I can't?

132
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,972
Well, I think something ought to
be done about it.

133
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,800
What are you going to do?

134
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:44,844
Well, I--

135
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,196
I'm gonna kiss you again.

136
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,808
But I want you to interrupt them.

137
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,680
Embracing in front of the whole city.

138
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:58,946
Good morning, Mercedes.

139
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,077
Oh, Fernand.

140
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,210
You know Captain Dantes,
Mssr de Mondego?

141
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,777
- Yes.
- Oh, naturally.

142
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,778
One o'clock, Edmond.

143
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:05,779
One o'clock.

144
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:06,822
Good morning, sir.

145
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,523
Your mother couldn't
possibly understand

146
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,047
this fascination for you.

147
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,744
- Never.
- But I can.

148
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:15,919
I knew you would.

149
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:18,313
Up to a certain point,
but not marriage.

150
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,662
Why not?

151
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,969
- Well, he has no family--
- I'll give him one.

152
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,319
Fernand, I've been warned,
scolded, threatened,

153
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:25,537
until I'm blue in the face.

154
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,583
I don't care about duty,
social position,

155
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,889
or what people say.

156
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,717
There are only two things that
really matter:

157
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,761
a man and a woman.

158
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,241
And Dantes is your man?

159
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:35,243
- Yes.
- I shan't say another word.

160
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,646
I shouldn't have spoken at all
had your mother not insisted.

161
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,203
I shall forget everything you've said.

162
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,465
I'm sure you will.

163
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:41,509
Goodbye.

164
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:43,947
I shall never forgive you.

165
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:51,215
Well, Fernand, I hope you've
made her see the light.

166
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,129
Clearer than ever.

167
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:53,173
I'm afraid I--

168
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,414
We'll get you some wooden shoes
and a bucket of fish.

169
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,005
Then you'll be in style.

170
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:04,315
Danglars, one of my own men,
gave me the information.

171
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,404
Dantes has the letter with him now.

172
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:07,971
Follow this Edmond Dantes.

173
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,669
Watch him, but don't arrest him

174
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,454
till he delivers the letter to
his confederate, whoever he is,

175
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,953
then seize them both
and bring them here.

176
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:14,848
Here's your warrant.

177
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,719
Yes, Mssr. Magistrate.

178
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:17,763
Well, Mondego,

179
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,722
in exposing this spy,

180
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,898
you've done a great service
to your king.

181
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,944
And to you, De Villefort.

182
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,337
And to Mme. De Rosas.

183
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:27,948
Merely what any friend would do

184
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:30,646
to save her from what we might
call an appalling marriage.

185
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:35,695
What brings you here?

186
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:41,918
I seek a golden treasure,
valuable above price.

187
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,662
Not so easy to obtain,
Mssr. Pirate.

188
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,925
First you must make formal demand,

189
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:52,755
because the custom of my country
is the same as that of others.

190
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,452
Is it a proposal you want?

191
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,715
Yes, and a formal one.

192
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,155
Well,

193
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,813
- I Edmond Dantes--
- Yes?

194
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:09,293
ask that--

195
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,210
I'm wrecked!

196
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:15,472
Coward!

197
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:20,000
The pirate's sunk.
I can't make the land.

198
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:22,045
Stuck on the reef of formality.

199
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,090
Yes.

200
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:25,851
But if you'll come aloft with me--

201
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,181
Aloft?

202
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:29,661
Yes, up in the rigging.
I can't think down here.

203
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,185
Suppose I refuse you up there?

204
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:34,449
Girl overboard.

205
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,819
Look, you can see the sea from here!

206
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,821
And clouds, like silver ships.

207
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,302
The ships that Edmond Dantes
will have some day.

208
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:05,436
Sailing into harbor
with what for cargo?

209
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,351
Oh, a lot of dreams...

210
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:10,441
And his proposal to Mercedes.

211
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:13,618
And her answer.

212
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,148
Yes?

213
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,890
Dantes is at the Café Reserve.

214
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,717
Mssr. Morrel is giving a dinner
in his honor.

215
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,545
Well, we, uh,
we can't wait any longer.

216
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,897
You stay here, I'll go there at once.

217
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:50,090
- Sure you're having a good time?
- Oh, yes. I like your friends.

218
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,744
They aren't just pretending to
be happy, they really are.

219
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,921
Oh, come now, before
the next dance starts.

220
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,444
Glasses, everybody!

221
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,533
Waiters, bring up the brandy!

222
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,930
More glasses, more wine!

223
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,543
I am looking for the captain
of the Pharaon. Is he here?

224
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,631
Yes, sir.

225
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,328
I have an important message for him.

226
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:12,939
Don't think I can disturb him.

227
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:13,983
I'm afraid you must.

228
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,291
Dear everybody!

229
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,424
To the betrothal of Edmond Dantes,

230
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:22,078
captain of the Pharaon

231
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:25,212
and Mme. Mercedes De Rosas.

232
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:27,431
May calm seas and a fair breeze

233
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,085
bring their ships safely

234
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:32,697
to the port of happiness,
prosperity, and a long life.

235
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:36,876
Drink to liberty and equality.

236
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:51,431
A gentleman with an urgent
message for you.

237
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,066
For me?

238
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,479
- The captain of the Pharaon.
- Oh, yes. I'll go with you now.

239
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:57,113
I'll be back in a moment.

240
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,290
Well, you've done it.

241
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,510
Now will you dance with me,
the rejected suitor

242
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:04,555
who hasn't changed his feelings
about you one bit?

243
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:09,647
- Here's the captain, sir.
- Good evening.

244
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,016
You are the captain of the Pharaon?

245
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Yes, sir.

246
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,128
Elba.

247
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:16,089
- I've been expecting you.
- No, no. Not here.

248
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,132
Follow me.

249
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,752
- Thank you. That's all.
- Good night.

250
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,804
Mssr., you're under arrest by
order of the king's magistrate.

251
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,588
- Mssr. De Villefort?
- Yes, sir

252
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,287
Oh, uh, very well.

253
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:42,637
Take him to the court chambers.

254
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,030
Follow me.

255
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,392
- You delivered the letter?
- Yes.

256
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,220
I am glad that's done.

257
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,482
Captain Dantes?

258
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,527
The king's magistrate
orders your arrest.

259
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:04,964
On what charge?

260
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,791
Suspicion of bearing
treasonable information.

261
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:11,057
Something's happened.

262
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,362
Something's wrong.

263
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,537
Nothing really.

264
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,906
I have to go to the court, that's all.

265
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,888
To answer questioning about
someone else.

266
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:18,562
I'll come along with you
if you like, Captain.

267
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:19,650
Perhaps I could be of some service.

268
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:21,067
Please do. I'm going too.

269
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,286
- To the jail? You will not.
- Oh, but Mother, I am.

270
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,984
Please stay here, everybody,
and dance.

271
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,247
It's nothing serious.
We'll be back soon.

272
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,771
Nice disgraceful start
for betrothal, isn't it?

273
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,824
Meddling again, eh?
I thought you were in Paris.

274
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,305
Instead you find me
in Marseilles, your prisoner.

275
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,698
Amusing, isn't it?

276
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:45,047
The humor completely escapes me.

277
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,091
It would.

278
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,224
Excuse me, I'm old-fashioned.

279
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:50,835
I don't think a father should
stand before his son.

280
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,406
If the king knew

281
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,756
that one of the conspirators
against him was my father--

282
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,193
My son would lose his office.

283
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:03,457
For that reason, you must protect me.

284
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,286
I will protect you.
And myself too.

285
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:10,420
I'll have you sent away
under guard on a ship tonight.

286
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:15,599
If you're planning to deport all
the French citizens

287
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,340
whose sympathies are with Napoleon,

288
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,082
there won't be anybody left in France.

289
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,825
How many messages has this
Dantes brought to you?

290
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:24,868
None.

291
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:27,872
Leclere was my man.
He's dead.

292
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,135
Dantes knows nothing of it.

293
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:30,484
I don't believe it.

294
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:35,184
There. I hope you appreciate
that I'm saving your life.

295
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:40,668
I see. Perhaps I can do a favor
for you sometime.

296
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:46,717
I shouldn't hesitate to ask it
in return for this.

297
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,328
Turn this prisoner over to Crown.

298
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,851
Yes, sir.

299
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:55,596
Goodnight, my, uh--
my most noble magistrate.

300
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:56,684
Yeah, none of that.

301
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:57,859
Come on along.
Come on along.

302
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:08,435
Thanks for breaking up
an intolerable party so soon.

303
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,437
Bring in Edmond Dantes alone.

304
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,353
Captain Dantes.

305
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,623
Edmond Dantes, captain of the Pharaon?

306
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,798
Yes, sir.

307
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,321
As you're a friend
of Mssr. Mondego's,

308
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,280
I'll do what I can for you.

309
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:28,323
Thank you, sir.

310
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,737
Now, do you call yourself
a loyal subject

311
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:32,241
of His Majesty the King?

312
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,460
Yes, sir.

313
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:35,157
And yet you're found
carrying a message

314
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,680
plotting treason against your ruler.

315
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:37,942
Oh, but, sir,

316
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,398
I was only carrying out
my captain's orders.

317
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:42,121
I knew nothing about what
was in the letter.

318
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,297
Who is the man you
delivered the letter to?

319
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,341
I don't know his name.

320
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:46,585
- Ever see him before?
- Never.

321
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,998
Could you give an accurate
description of him?

322
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,913
I'm sure I could. He's about
your height--

323
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:52,956
That's enough.

324
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,699
You can identify him another time

325
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:59,529
- Why did you stop at Elba?
- Captain's orders.

326
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,836
- Where's the captain?
- Dead.

327
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,708
Dead? Who's to vouch
for your innocence?

328
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,599
Almost any member of the crew
would tell you that--

329
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,059
Would Mssr. Danglars know?

330
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,192
Certainly.

331
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,717
- Bring Mssr. Danglars in.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,392
This places me in
a very difficult position.

333
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,895
I never dreamed--

334
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,333
Oh, I'm not holding you
responsible, Inspector Mondego.

335
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:27,209
Ah. Who gave the order
to stop at Elba?

336
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,256
The first mate,
Mssr. Dantes, sir.

337
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,127
Describe what happened.

338
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
We lay off the island
a whole day, sir.

339
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,523
An officer came alongside
in a small boat

340
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:39,003
and gave Mssr. Dantes
a letter, sir.

341
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,247
No, you're mistaken, Danglars.

342
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,158
He went to the captain's cabin.
I stayed on deck.

343
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,792
I saw what happened.

344
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,185
One of you is obviously lying.

345
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,491
- I have nothing to hide, sir.
- Neither have I.

346
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:51,320
Mssr. Danglars has been
in my office many times.

347
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:54,236
I know him to be a most sincere
and honest man.

348
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,542
Oh, I see.

349
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,373
Danglars told you about Elba
and the letter

350
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,897
because he wanted to be captain.

351
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,682
And you told the magistrate here
because--

352
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:07,554
because of Mercedes.

353
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,644
You appear here as my friends.

354
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,579
Mssr. Morrel is outside.
He'll tell you that--

355
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:14,603
That's enough.

356
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:17,651
Take this prisoner
to the Chateau d'If.

357
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:18,694
Yes, sir.

358
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,306
Why to the Chateau d' If?

359
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:21,916
Why not right here till my trial?

360
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,787
Your trial?
Oh yes.

361
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,112
Well, it's only the matter of an hour

362
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:26,660
to bring you back across the harbor.

363
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:29,837
Can I see my fiancée,
Mme. De Rosas?

364
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
No.

365
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,730
Will you give me a few minutes
with Mssr. Morrel?

366
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,886
No. He's under suspicion too.

367
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,814
Uh, will you want me anymore, sir?

368
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,513
- No.
- Uh, for the trial?

369
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,254
He's had his trial.

370
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:18,668
Who's there?

371
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,032
Prisoner, sir, from the mainland.

372
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,543
- Criminal or political?
- Political, sir.

373
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:25,849
Well, put him anyplace.
I'll see him in the morning.

374
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:27,721
This note is important, sir.

375
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,822
I'd like to write a message.

376
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,258
Certainly, certainly.

377
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,219
Now let me see:

378
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,572
34, occupied, 35, occupied.

379
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,443
Ah, 27 empty.

380
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:58,142
Twenty seven, a splendid apartment.

381
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,622
Thank you very much.

382
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,991
Will you kindly see this delivered

383
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:02,930
to Mssr. Morrel in Marseilles
early tomorrow?

384
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,192
Certainly, certainly.

385
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:05,909
He'll have my attorney here
in the morning.

386
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,370
Certainly. Twenty-seven, I said.
Good night.

387
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:24,691
Speak to me. Anything!
Just a word!

388
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:25,779
God bless you.

389
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:27,346
No talking to the prisoners.

390
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,097
This ain't the right cell!

391
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:42,752
Can't you read?
This ain't 27, it's 37.

392
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,471
His attorney will be here
in the morning.

393
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,045
E...

394
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:18,397
L...

395
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:19,876
B...

396
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
A.

397
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,796
Napoleon has escaped from Elba.

398
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,017
N...

399
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:32,454
A...

400
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:33,498
P...

401
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,890
O...

402
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,326
L...

403
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,591
Gentlemen, the king.

404
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:58,524
Mssr. De Villefort,

405
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,482
His Majesty's royal agent
at Marseilles.

406
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:09,098
Good evening.

407
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:11,841
State your urgent business.

408
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,496
Sire, I was fortunate
in arresting a spy

409
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,499
who possessed this letter which
states that Napoleon

410
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:20,415
would leave Elba for France
on February the 26th.

411
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,156
And this is the first of March.

412
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:25,115
He'd have landed by now.

413
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:27,596
I commend your zeal, de Villefort,

414
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,991
but I have thousands
of secret agents in the South,

415
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:34,995
one of whom certainly would have
warned us by now.

416
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:37,084
- Now--
- Your Majesty.

417
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,913
What a fuss!
Speak, Blacas.

418
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:42,785
- Napoleon has landed in France.
- Impossible!

419
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:44,874
A message just came
by signal telegraph.

420
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,615
He was received, sire, with open arms.

421
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,835
The usurper in France!

422
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:52,665
And no inkling before this
from our valiant agents?

423
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:57,408
Blind fools!
Blind fools all of them.

424
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,673
All but one, my friend de Villefort.

425
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,588
Summon the minister of war!

426
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,374
De Villefort, even in this
moment of crisis,

427
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,897
the king does not forget.

428
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:12,467
Here, take this as a token
of my gratitude.

429
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,383
Where's the minister of war?!

430
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,215
Well then, we have three prisoners

431
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:22,912
in our dungeons here,

432
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:24,653
the reason for whose imprisonment

433
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,873
has long since been forgotten,

434
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,440
so that even their names don't
appear in our records.

435
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:34,837
Edmond Dantes is henceforth
listed as dead.

436
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,842
As Number 27, he
will merit no concern.

437
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,543
You're here.

438
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:57,207
So Dantes is dead, eh? Or am I
asking too many questions?

439
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,948
He died just in time.

440
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,883
Morrel is in Paris
for an audience with Bonaparte

441
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,386
and Bonaparte acts quickly.

442
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,550
Well, it didn't take him long
to put me out of office.

443
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,889
This is my last
and most important official act.

444
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,630
Political prisoners will be
released at once.

445
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,830
And Dantes with Morrel's backing
could easily find me

446
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:12,309
a home at the Chateau d'If.

447
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:16,052
Come in.

448
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,620
Oh, Fernand.

449
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,624
A letter from Mssr. Morrel
by special post.

450
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:24,254
He's arranged his audience
with the emperor

451
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:27,455
and promises that Edmond will be
freed in a week!

452
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:30,545
I'm afraid it's already too late.

453
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,894
Too late?

454
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,899
He's not--?

455
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:40,599
In trying to escape,
he was shot and killed.

456
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:42,644
He wouldn't do that.

457
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:45,604
I wrote him every day that we
would save him.

458
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:00,488
Then take me to his grave.

459
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:04,492
Sea is the cemetery
of the Chateau d'If.

460
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:18,419
Good morning.

461
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:20,813
Is it a nice day?

462
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,075
Or is it stormy?

463
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,514
Did you ask the governor if I
could please see him?

464
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,298
It's about my attorney, my trial.

465
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,739
Nice conversation I have
with you both every day.

466
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,088
Why don't you say something?

467
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:36,655
Speak to me, swear at me, anything!

468
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:40,397
That hurts! Let go! Let go!

469
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:41,679
That's just to see if you could speak.

470
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:42,985
You tell the governor
I won't eat any more

471
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:44,750
of his wormy food scraps.
Do you--?

472
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:45,838
Do you hear?

473
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,759
After this, we feed him
through the door.

474
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:13,692
So you don't like our food, eh?

475
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:17,367
Before you get down from there,

476
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,716
you'll be chewing it
out of your beard.

477
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,804
The only reason we ain't killing you

478
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,047
for attacking a guard

479
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,875
is because the governor
gets two sous a day

480
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:24,746
for every live prisoner.
Come on.

481
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:31,622
He ain't dead.

482
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,066
Mssr. Mondego.

483
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:35,556
I'm leaving Mercedes in your care

484
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,210
because you have always loved her.

485
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:38,559
And always will.

486
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,479
Mother.

487
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:46,522
No, no.

488
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:50,005
I'm not going to die yet, Mercedes.

489
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:53,095
Not until you promise
you will marry Fernand.

490
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:18,425
Fernand Marie-Antoine de Mondego,

491
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:22,168
do you accept this woman who
stands before you as your wife?

492
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:23,211
I do.

493
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,260
Mercedes Yvonne Melanie De Rosas,

494
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:29,784
do you accept this man
who stands before you

495
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,872
as your husband?

496
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,185
I do.

497
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:50,457
Ego conjungo vos in matrimonium,

498
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,114
in nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritu Sancti.

499
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:56,157
Amen.

500
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,006
Mercedes.

501
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,183
Mercedes.

502
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:50,212
Mercedes? Yes?

503
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,469
Thank God you're a prisoner, too.

504
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:16,472
I thought you might be
a jailor deceiving me.

505
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:18,474
Encourage me to betray myself.

506
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:22,739
Can you understand what I'm saying?

507
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:24,263
Can you speak?

508
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:27,048
No. I'm too-- too--

509
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:31,748
To feel the warmth
of a comrade's hand.

510
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:36,057
I had no means of knowing
there was a dungeon

511
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,101
lower down than mine.

512
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:41,932
I burrowed 30 feet through
solid rock for six years,

513
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,935
hoping to reach the outside wall
and make my escape.

514
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,115
And now I find I'm only
in another cell.

515
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:51,594
Six years!

516
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:53,901
I'm sorry.

517
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,208
I am the Abbe Faria.

518
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,079
I was Edmond Dantes.

519
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:00,951
How long have you been here?

520
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:03,258
I don't know.

521
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:07,175
Since the 28th of February, 1815.

522
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:08,307
How long is that?

523
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,350
Eight years.

524
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:13,007
This is the 7th of June, 1823.

525
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,617
Only eight years?

526
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,272
I'm still young.

527
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:19,666
That's funny.

528
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:21,319
I'm 68.

529
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:25,063
I've been in prisons 20 years.

530
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,890
I'll help you out.
Let's talk.

531
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:29,328
No, no. It's not yet big enough
for my shoulders.

532
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:31,373
Oh, I'll dig it away.
I'll work all night!

533
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,639
The guards must think the figure
in the bed is you asleep.

534
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:37,901
Yes.

535
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,806
- Can you see?
- Perfectly.

536
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,024
Owl's eyes.

537
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:16,026
Nature's compensation
for those obliged

538
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,680
to live always in the dark.

539
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,770
Here. Now we can stand.

540
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,476
You see this stone,

541
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,042
bevelled and grooved,

542
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,395
applying the same
engineering principles

543
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:38,310
used in the building of the pyramids.

544
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:40,660
Good likeness, isn't it?

545
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:45,099
I'll get a candle.
I want you to see my work.

546
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,493
- Candle?
- Made from beef fats.

547
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,321
- And a match.
- Matches!

548
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,497
Made from the gratings of a twig broom

549
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,151
and some sulphur they gave me

550
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,196
when I complained
of a skin affliction.

551
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:57,371
You see these?

552
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,375
Thread, made from blanket ravelling.

553
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:02,899
Needles and pens from fishbones.

554
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:05,119
Ink from pot black and vinegar.

555
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,208
Knife, file, chisel,

556
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:10,298
from an old kettle
that I managed to hide.

557
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:11,430
And, Edmond,

558
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,042
could it seem like bragging if I,

559
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,566
honored by degrees
from five universities,

560
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,960
managed to outwit
the six-year-old mind

561
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,527
of my jailors?

562
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,225
They call me a mad old priest
and harmless,

563
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,184
and I encourage them in this belief,

564
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:30,100
and in return, they
grant me certain favors,

565
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:32,451
such as chunks of chalk rock and slate

566
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,801
with which I've inscribed
on these walls

567
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:37,064
the creeds and formulas
on which are based

568
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:39,632
the sum total of mans' knowledge.

569
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,155
This is my chronometer,

570
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,853
from which I calculate the time.

571
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:44,985
My calendar.

572
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,120
My faith.

573
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,862
All quotations that you see

574
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:55,952
in the languages in which
they were originally written.

575
00:36:55,996 --> 00:37:00,087
Greek, Hebrew, Latin,
Sanskrit over there.

576
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,091
French, Italian, English,
and German and Arabic.

577
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:06,833
I don't expect you to understand
much of it now,

578
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:09,923
but with patience and
willingness, you can master it.

579
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:11,098
And they call you mad.

580
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:14,928
They call me mad because
I speak the truth.

581
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,495
Because I've repeatedly offered them

582
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:18,845
as high as six million francs
to release me.

583
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:20,368
Six million francs?

584
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,849
Oh, I see.

585
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,590
You think I'm crazy, too.

586
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:25,721
Well, I don't blame you.

587
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,986
But everyone has heard of
the de Spada family fortune.

588
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,338
I have, since boyhood.
A buried treasure, wasn't it?

589
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:34,817
Dating from ancient Rome.

590
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:39,082
Well, for 20 years,

591
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:42,303
I was librarian and tutor
to the Duke de Spada.

592
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:45,263
He had no children
and made me his soul heir.

593
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:48,788
I planned to use it
to ease suffering humanity.

594
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,007
But this so enraged
the old duke's enemies

595
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,487
who planned after his death

596
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:54,968
to seize the fortune for themselves

597
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,970
that they submitted me first
to torture

598
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:58,711
and then threw me into prison

599
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:01,279
in an effort to force from me
the secret hiding place

600
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:02,628
which I alone know.

601
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,027
Together, we will dig our way
to freedom

602
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:13,247
and one half the treasure
shall be yours.

603
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,471
I'll dig my fingers to the bone.

604
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:21,995
I'll tear these rocks apart!

605
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:25,085
Money, riches,

606
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:29,524
power with which to strangle
and crush three rotten rascals!

607
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:30,568
Stop! Just stop.

608
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:36,749
Oh, what a miserable creature you are.

609
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,881
Your eyes green with greed.

610
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:40,840
Your heart filled with revenge.

611
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:44,670
In such a condition, you're not
fit to have one soul.

612
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:45,845
Patience.

613
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,152
What a long road you have to travel.

614
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:51,764
Be thankful your digging tools

615
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:53,418
are but bits of crockery and iron.

616
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:54,593
It will take time.

617
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:57,204
Pray for it to be a long time.

618
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,424
So that when you emerge
into the light,

619
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:02,557
it will not be as a revengeful
horseman of the apocalypse,

620
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:06,082
but as an avenging angel doing
the work of God.

621
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:10,043
I'll obey you in everything.
Everything.

622
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:11,566
We must watch out for the jailor.

623
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,133
Quick, back to your own cell.

624
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:20,880
Pray.

625
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:30,368
Most Heavenly Father,

626
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,500
at Thy will

627
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:36,286
the most barren earth blossoms
into beautiful bloom.

628
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,375
Amen.

629
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:47,559
And then Baron Rondeau
fell at the last hurdle

630
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,865
and burst his breeches.

631
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:52,564
You really must see it.
And the horses are too, too--

632
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,217
Well, you know what horses are.

633
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:55,958
Get Fernand to take you.

634
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:00,136
Since he's been treasurer to the king,

635
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,878
he has no time
for... frivolities.

636
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,228
So?

637
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,407
- Well, good-bye, Mercedes.
- Good-bye.

638
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:27,729
I've just heard
that the king's treasurer

639
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,905
is so occupied with official business

640
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:32,604
that he has no time for frivolities.

641
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,562
My official business this evening

642
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:37,173
takes me to 58 Avenue Montaigne.

643
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:38,523
I shall be home.

644
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,442
You see, Mother?

645
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:46,356
This is how the sail goes up and down.

646
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,662
I see.

647
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:49,577
Mercedes!

648
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,491
Yes, Fernand?

649
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,541
Oh, forgive my great
familiarity, Countess.

650
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,194
- Countess?
- Yes, Countess.

651
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:03,852
Today the king has restored
to my family its rightful title.

652
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:09,467
My son, you are now a viscount.

653
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,253
But I don't wanna be a viscount.
I wanna be a sailor.

654
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:16,299
You'll be a viscount
on your father's side.

655
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,699
Good evening, Danglars.

656
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:28,790
Everything is arranged.

657
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:31,358
The banking house
of Danglars and Company

658
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,099
opens its doors for Paris

659
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:34,666
for the first time tomorrow morning.

660
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:37,538
Congratulations.
I'll finish myself, Francois.

661
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:40,802
And in return,

662
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:43,239
for the many valuable clients
you have sent me,

663
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:46,025
here are your shares
in the company as I promised.

664
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:48,941
I shall deliver Mondego's
as soon as I leave you.

665
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:49,984
Thank you.

666
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:54,207
Oh, I read this morning that
the king had rewarded you again.

667
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,164
Oh, yes.

668
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,383
I think I can promise you

669
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:58,559
His Majesty's personal account
very soon.

670
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:00,648
That will mean certain success.

671
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,956
And you shall have
a larger share for that.

672
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:05,392
I expect it.

673
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:08,308
Yes! I said expect it and--
and you shall have it.

674
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:10,832
Er, there is only one fly
in the ointment.

675
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:13,531
- Mm? Who is it?
- Uh, Deputy Mundine.

676
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:15,794
Oh, he's always shouting
about the people's rights.

677
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:17,578
He threatens proposing a new law

678
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:19,624
which will seriously curtail
our profits.

679
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:22,670
He will be silenced tomorrow morning.

680
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:24,063
Francois, my hat!

681
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:26,152
Time, time, time, time, time!

682
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:45,780
How much longer do you really
think we'll have to dig?

683
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:48,261
Nearly five years,
according to my estimate.

684
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,306
Only five years.
Well, well.

685
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,308
Just like the day after tomorrow
for us.

686
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:03,815
Edmond, Edmond, come quickly.
I've just examined the tunnel.

687
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:05,773
Your lunar observations were correct.

688
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:07,340
This morning at 10:17

689
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:09,081
was the highest tide in six months.

690
00:44:09,124 --> 00:44:10,560
And water seeped through a crevice

691
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:11,561
and loosened some rocks.

692
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:13,172
Wonderful.
I'll come along now.

693
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:27,055
You were right, Father.
Almost a pool of water here.

694
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:30,276
- Salt water. Taste it!
- Only three feet more to go.

695
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,297
Listen, can you hear the sea
pounding against the rocks?

696
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:34,193
Doing some of our work for us.

697
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:36,629
See?

698
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:39,285
Rocks falling all the time.

699
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:40,765
Be careful.

700
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:42,288
Come back!
Quickly!

701
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:48,990
No! Father! Father!
Are you hurt?

702
00:44:56,345 --> 00:44:59,609
Don't lay me down.
Sit me up.

703
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:01,568
My ribs are crushed.

704
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:04,702
I don't want the blood
to get to my head yet.

705
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:05,920
Cross my legs.

706
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:09,663
Put my hands on my elbows.

707
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,232
Edmond,

708
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:19,717
loosen my belt and take
the de Spada parchment.

709
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:24,417
In my will,
written on a piece of cloth,

710
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,375
it names you my sole heir.

711
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:29,814
When people die,

712
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:32,207
we feel aggrieved

713
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:35,080
because their minds are lost to us.

714
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,690
How fortunate am I.

715
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:41,434
I leave my mind behind
in your possession.

716
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:43,044
It is part of yours.

717
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:46,439
Use it as an instrument for justice.

718
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:51,487
My blessing.

719
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:55,753
Edmond, if you could only see.

720
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,582
Death is so beautiful.

721
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:24,825
- Help! Help!
- What was that?

722
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:27,785
Help! Help!

723
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:30,309
Help! Help!

724
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:36,837
In here, Number 34.

725
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:37,882
The old Abbe.

726
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:39,285
Well, something's happened to him.

727
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:52,810
- He looks dead.
- He is dead.

728
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:56,291
We'll get the undertakers.

729
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:58,511
That's the only way they ever
get outta this place.

730
00:47:02,036 --> 00:47:03,036
Hurry up, Jules.

731
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:06,009
You get the chain and shot.
Thirty-six pounder.

732
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,869
I ain't gonna carry it
way back here by myself.

733
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,305
Gotta get the stretcher, too.

734
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:11,829
All right.
That's good enough.

735
00:47:31,936 --> 00:47:33,372
Go on back and shut that door.

736
00:47:34,547 --> 00:47:36,067
Think he's gonna get up and walk away?

737
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,769
- This oughta sink him.
- Go on. Throw it on.

738
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:28,530
- Who closed the door?
- Don't look at me.

739
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:43,110
Come on. Put that rope
around his feet.

740
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,375
Tie it good.

741
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:54,904
I'll take the head.

742
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:56,732
No, it's your turn to take the feet.

743
00:49:56,776 --> 00:49:57,777
All right.

744
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:10,616
Pretty heavy for an old man, ain't he?

745
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:12,139
Yeah. Too heavy.

746
00:50:29,983 --> 00:50:36,337
God... have... mercy...
on... his... soul.

747
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:43,665
Captain Vampa!

748
00:51:45,754 --> 00:51:47,452
What is it?
Harbor police?

749
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:48,670
No, a man in the water.

750
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:55,826
Let some other ship pick him up.

751
00:51:56,939 --> 00:51:58,506
We don't want any strangers aboard.

752
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,118
I always say land your fish first.

753
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:02,989
Then, if you don't like it,
throw it back.

754
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:06,166
What do you say?
Shall we pick him up?

755
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,472
- Aye.
- Aye, sir.

756
00:52:07,515 --> 00:52:08,386
All right.

757
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:09,517
Bring her round,

758
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:10,961
and we'll pick him up the larboard.

759
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:13,074
Hand him up there, corporal.

760
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:16,350
Come. Heave.
All together. Come on.

761
00:52:20,485 --> 00:52:21,485
Hang on.

762
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:22,747
Put him down there.

763
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:33,802
Where'd you come from, Neptune?

764
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:36,109
Well, I-- I--

765
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,154
No lies.

766
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:39,067
I know.

767
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:42,159
Your skin's as wet as a fish's belly.

768
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,596
Prison or the galleys?

769
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,380
Get him some food.

770
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:53,474
I suppose you'd like to get rid
of this seaweed?

771
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:03,658
This coat of mine will be
all right for now.

772
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:07,053
Ali here cannot talk, but he
wants to give you the sandals.

773
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:14,016
You look like a ghost.

774
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:16,279
I am.

775
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:18,238
The sun'll take care of that.

776
00:53:20,632 --> 00:53:22,242
Jacopo says you've been a sailor.

777
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:25,680
- Yes.
- I'm Captain Vampa.

778
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:27,552
We smuggle for a living.

779
00:53:27,595 --> 00:53:29,206
The crew all shares and shares alike.

780
00:53:30,555 --> 00:53:32,034
We could use a good sailor.

781
00:53:33,732 --> 00:53:35,081
Uh, what's your name or...

782
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:37,431
what shall we call you?

783
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:40,434
- Sinbad.
- Sinbad?

784
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:42,871
Sinbad the sailor.

785
00:53:55,144 --> 00:53:57,103
What you lookin' at on Monte Cristo?

786
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:59,061
There's nothing there but wild goats.

787
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:01,150
Nothing but goats,
that's what I'm looking at.

788
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:05,067
Captain Bonnie was due here
this morning

789
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:07,200
with a cargo of tobacco
to trade for our laces.

790
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,438
If he's not here by nightfall, I'll--

791
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:10,812
Maybe he's round the lee
of the island.

792
00:54:10,856 --> 00:54:12,118
Well, I'll up anchor and see.

793
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:13,226
If you like, while you're gone,

794
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,444
I'll go ashore and kill our dinner.

795
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:16,253
You can pick me up when we get back.

796
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:17,404
Well, it better be young and tender

797
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:18,472
or we'll leave you there.

798
00:54:18,516 --> 00:54:19,995
Up anchor, all hands.

799
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,128
Jacopo, I'm going ashore
in the small boat.

800
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:47,185
My dear Abbe,

801
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:52,147
if you were only really here
beside me... to see.

802
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:54,672
You were right.

803
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:57,631
The world is mine.

804
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,826
The Chateau d'If.

805
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:21,002
On these moonlight nights

806
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:23,309
I can hear the good people
of Marseilles saying,

807
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:24,876
"Isn't it beautiful?"

808
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:31,186
Here are the names of the three.

809
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:34,146
Burn them into your memory.
Never forget them.

810
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:36,627
I want to know everything
about them, everything.

811
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,716
About their wives,

812
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,761
sweethearts, mistresses.

813
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:42,478
About their children,

814
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,291
family life, state connections.

815
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,687
Dates, facts, histories, details
down to the finest points.

816
00:57:49,857 --> 00:57:52,947
I wish to know them as
intimately as I know myself.

817
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:55,863
And as I know my weaknesses,
I shall discover theirs.

818
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:56,908
And then,

819
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:58,692
I'll strike.

820
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:03,088
They all live in Paris,
where I'm sending you now.

821
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:05,090
I'll give you money enough
for the first month.

822
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:06,133
Spend freely.

823
00:58:06,874 --> 00:58:08,528
Live like a king if you will,

824
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:10,922
but get me what I want.

825
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:14,839
In 60 days, draw on
the Count de Monte Cristo

826
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:18,451
through the banking firm
of Thompson and French in Rome.

827
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,584
For in 60 days I will have established

828
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:24,631
my right to that title
and the banking firm I will own.

829
00:58:24,675 --> 00:58:26,546
Ali, we're going to Albania,

830
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,070
to trace carefully the steps
of one Mondego there,

831
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:30,419
and if I'm not mistaken,

832
00:58:30,463 --> 00:58:34,032
we'll dig up a trail as foul
as stinking fish.

833
00:58:34,075 --> 00:58:35,424
We all meet next in Rome,

834
00:58:36,948 --> 00:58:40,429
where plotting is a custom
more ancient than the catacombs.

835
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:03,757
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

836
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:06,543
You make one doubt, my dear Count,

837
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:09,458
that I was ever champion
of the king's guards.

838
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:11,896
You take your fencing very seriously.

839
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:13,550
If I seem vicious in my attack,

840
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:15,595
it's because I always imagine
you're not my friend,

841
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:16,639
but my enemy.

842
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:20,034
- Tomorrow at eight?
- As usual.

843
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:26,258
- Excellency!
- Welcome, Jacopo!

844
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:28,477
It's good to see you.

845
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:30,218
Well, tell me all about Paris.

846
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:33,004
Is it as gay as they say,
with wine, women and song?

847
00:59:33,047 --> 00:59:34,614
Oh, very gay.

848
00:59:36,398 --> 00:59:40,054
I made several mistakes.
I had too much money to spend.

849
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:41,423
Well, it didn't prevent
your collecting

850
00:59:41,447 --> 00:59:43,144
a mass of remarkable information.

851
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:46,495
Look. I've had every word copied
in my famous biographies.

852
00:59:46,539 --> 00:59:48,193
The Villefort history alone occupies

853
00:59:48,236 --> 00:59:49,890
more than 7,000 entries.

854
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:52,458
When I discover what really
could be found out

855
00:59:52,501 --> 00:59:53,720
about a person,

856
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:57,289
it made a very good
little boy out of me.

857
00:59:57,332 --> 00:59:59,857
And taught me exactly how to deal with

858
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,989
three very bad little boys,

859
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:04,122
who are leaders of a great nation.

860
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:06,603
I must attack them
with the same weapons

861
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:10,432
they've so viciously used
against their countless enemies.

862
01:00:10,476 --> 01:00:13,348
Mondego with flattery,
Danglars with money,

863
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:14,611
De Villefort, law.

864
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:17,135
Well, now, the late news.

865
01:00:17,178 --> 01:00:21,313
Albert, the young viscount
de Mondego, is here in Rome.

866
01:00:21,356 --> 01:00:22,967
Good.

867
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:27,928
And when he left, I found myself
in the same stagecoach with him.

868
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:29,930
- Much to your surprise.
- Of course.

869
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:34,761
Well, he's a fine young man
from your reports;

870
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:36,894
courageous, strong,

871
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:38,286
a junior officer in the navy.

872
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,768
A sailor.

873
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,251
We'll give him one full day
of pleasure,

874
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:48,427
then tomorrow night, perhaps--

875
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,342
The catacombs?

876
01:00:50,385 --> 01:00:51,648
The catacombs.

877
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,739
Well, Jacopo, we'll soon be
leaving Rome.

878
01:00:55,782 --> 01:00:58,350
I'm ready, at last,
to open the gates of Paris

879
01:00:58,393 --> 01:01:01,222
with Albert Mondego for my key.

880
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:04,704
You tell your friend

881
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:07,098
that if the 25,000 gold
was not paid by midnight

882
01:01:07,141 --> 01:01:08,379
that your body would take its place

883
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:09,491
among these other beauties?

884
01:01:11,406 --> 01:01:13,234
I never thought I was worth that much.

885
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:15,367
I don't see why he should.

886
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,021
That would be bad.

887
01:01:17,064 --> 01:01:20,720
Deliver this to Signor
Jocopo Cavlarani.

888
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:23,462
If you could wait until I reach
my father by post, I--

889
01:01:23,505 --> 01:01:24,505
We can't wait.

890
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,210
Which one of these beauties
do you think I'll be like?

891
01:01:32,253 --> 01:01:33,690
One's as good as another.

892
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:36,475
Make your own choice.

893
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:44,048
- Excellencey.
- Good evening, Vampa.

894
01:01:44,091 --> 01:01:45,179
The boy?

895
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:46,311
Asleep.

896
01:01:46,354 --> 01:01:47,747
He don't frighten easily.

897
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,542
Oh, you're here.

898
01:02:00,586 --> 01:02:02,283
Yes. I didn't have
any money on hand,

899
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:03,937
so I rushed to the Count
of Monte Cristo.

900
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:06,026
He kindly offered
to come here with me.

901
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,462
The Count de Monte Cristo.

902
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:09,900
This is the Viscount de Mondego.

903
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:14,034
What does this mean?

904
01:02:14,078 --> 01:02:17,385
Excellency, I had no way
of knowing he was your friend.

905
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:18,517
What can I do?

906
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,562
How can I pay for my mistake?

907
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:22,826
In the future, it would be wiser
to be more careful.

908
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:24,479
Yes, Excellency.

909
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:26,220
Jacopo told me you were a great man,

910
01:02:26,264 --> 01:02:29,789
but I never realized
you had influence over--

911
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,182
over everything.

912
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:34,185
Only enough to protect my friends.

913
01:02:34,228 --> 01:02:35,553
I hope you don't think this happens

914
01:02:35,577 --> 01:02:37,492
to every visitor to Rome.

915
01:02:37,536 --> 01:02:38,972
Perhaps we can make you forget it

916
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:40,416
by filling the rest of your holiday

917
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:41,801
with nothing but pleasure.

918
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:43,368
Er, the gentleman's hat.

919
01:02:58,165 --> 01:02:59,993
I'm dying to meet this Monte Cristo

920
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:03,083
who's so remarkable,
marvelous, courtly,

921
01:03:03,127 --> 01:03:05,042
and all the other adjectives
you've called him.

922
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:08,436
- You'll see. He's-- he's--
- I know, I know.

923
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,829
He's never been to Paris before.

924
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:12,527
You've told me that, too.
Many times.

925
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:14,921
He said he'd be here
at 10 o'clock precisely.

926
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:16,705
It's almost that now.

927
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:18,272
I know everything about him

928
01:03:18,316 --> 01:03:20,840
except why he wanted
a copy of my portrait.

929
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:21,885
I told you that, too.

930
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:25,279
When he was visiting me at my hotel

931
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:27,344
and saw the miniature of you
I always carry with me,

932
01:03:27,368 --> 01:03:29,893
he simply asked if he could have
it copied for his gallery.

933
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:31,546
Yes, but--

934
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:34,419
But why not? Aren't you the most
beautiful woman in Paris?

935
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:36,116
In all France for that matter?

936
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,857
In all the world.

937
01:03:39,076 --> 01:03:40,512
Mssr. de Villefort.

938
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:42,577
- Good morning, Fernand.
- Oh, good morning, de Villefort.

939
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:43,689
I stopped by to show you

940
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:45,256
Danglars' suggestions for the week.

941
01:03:47,301 --> 01:03:49,738
Oh, buying heavily
of Spanish bonds, eh?

942
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:51,716
I suppose as usual it would be
wise to follow suit.

943
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,090
Yes.

944
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:55,353
We'll drop our buying orders
at his bank on the way.

945
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:57,224
Will you come in my carriage?

946
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:59,400
Or are there too many ladies
waiting at their windows

947
01:03:59,444 --> 01:04:00,880
to wave to you as you go by?

948
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,795
Never too many, de Villefort.

949
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,014
I can't go for a little.

950
01:04:04,057 --> 01:04:05,667
I promised Albert that I would meet

951
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,365
this mysterious Count de Monte Cristo.

952
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:09,367
Oh, he saved Albert's life, didn't he?

953
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:11,021
Something of the sort, yes.

954
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:12,065
Oh, there they are now.

955
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:14,130
Suppose I wait for you in there?

956
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:15,416
Would you mind?

957
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,418
And then please interrupt me
after a moment?

958
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:18,462
I will.

959
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:21,900
Yes?

960
01:04:23,294 --> 01:04:24,425
Father...

961
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:26,210
the Count de Monte Cristo.

962
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:29,953
Charmed.

963
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,044
My son has told me
of your many kindnesses,

964
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:36,307
how you saved him
from the hands of bandits,

965
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:38,396
with which, I believe,
your country's infested.

966
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:40,920
I dare say there are bandits
in other countries.

967
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:42,356
Known by other names.

968
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:44,575
Perhaps.

969
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:49,015
My pardon.
I'm sorry to interrupt,

970
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:51,191
but we've little time, Fernand.

971
01:04:51,235 --> 01:04:52,279
Good morning, Albert.

972
01:04:52,323 --> 01:04:53,802
Count de Monte Cristo,

973
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:56,283
may I present the King's
attorney, Mssr. de Villefort.

974
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:57,327
Honored.

975
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,330
It is a pleasure, sir.

976
01:04:59,373 --> 01:05:01,071
I have followed your brilliant career

977
01:05:01,114 --> 01:05:03,073
with a great deal of interest.

978
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:05,553
Thank you.
Thank you, indeed.

979
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:09,079
Excellencies, the great country
of France awaits your services.

980
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:11,211
Please don't let me detain you.

981
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:12,691
If you will be so kind.

982
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:15,868
We shall meet soon again,
my dear count.

983
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,218
I shall plan for it, Count de Mondego.

984
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:22,962
Albert, is your mother well?

985
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,529
Yes, Father.

986
01:05:24,572 --> 01:05:27,488
Tell her that I shall do my best
to see her sometime today.

987
01:05:32,363 --> 01:05:35,061
Oh, if in a moment I excuse myself,

988
01:05:35,105 --> 01:05:38,499
you'll understand it's only to
send a message to my lady love

989
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:40,458
naming our rendezvous
for this afternoon.

990
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:41,589
I understand.

991
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:42,721
The Countess is waiting.

992
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:54,341
My dear Count, how can I
ever thank you for--

993
01:05:54,385 --> 01:05:56,213
for what you've done for my son?

994
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:02,001
It was humiliating to think
that one of my country's guests

995
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:03,960
should suffer such an indignity.

996
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:09,835
Won't you sit down?

997
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:31,596
I'd have known you anywhere.

998
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:33,815
From your portrait.

999
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:36,035
Oh, yes.

1000
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,515
Albert told me you had it copied.

1001
01:06:39,865 --> 01:06:40,865
Why?

1002
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:43,347
A painter rarely catches beauty.

1003
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,435
When he does,

1004
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:46,045
the combination I can't resist.

1005
01:06:47,742 --> 01:06:50,049
I hope you weren't displeased.

1006
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:51,355
On the contrary.

1007
01:06:55,054 --> 01:06:56,454
Getting along famously, aren't you?

1008
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:57,490
Yes.

1009
01:06:58,275 --> 01:06:59,667
I must tear myself away.

1010
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:04,585
I have a house I've never seen
awaiting my inspection.

1011
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:06,239
You'll call again?

1012
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:08,589
If I don't provoke your hospitality.

1013
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:18,121
You know my address,
you won't neglect me?

1014
01:07:18,164 --> 01:07:19,164
Tomorrow?

1015
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,733
In the afternoon, I shall be home.

1016
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:31,264
Mother!

1017
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:36,922
Who is he?

1018
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:40,143
The Count de Monte Cristo.

1019
01:07:41,318 --> 01:07:42,493
No, I mean--

1020
01:07:46,975 --> 01:07:50,109
Tell me everything you know about him.

1021
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:54,070
Why, Mother.
Is he so strange?

1022
01:07:55,288 --> 01:07:56,768
I don't know.

1023
01:08:01,338 --> 01:08:04,993
There's just something about him
that frightens me.

1024
01:08:05,037 --> 01:08:07,083
Oh, silly.

1025
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:11,696
Perhaps I am...

1026
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:15,395
R...

1027
01:08:15,439 --> 01:08:16,439
E...

1028
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:17,875
N...

1029
01:08:18,311 --> 01:08:19,311
C...

1030
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:20,834
H.

1031
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:33,500
Nothing would give me greater
pleasure, my dear Count,

1032
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:35,633
than to take care
of your banking in Paris,

1033
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:38,462
but there must be some mistake
in this letter of advice.

1034
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:41,029
Are Thompson and French
in the habit of making mistakes?

1035
01:08:41,073 --> 01:08:45,033
Oh, never before. My most
reliable correspondents. But I--

1036
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:46,992
This is their stationary,
properly watermarked.

1037
01:08:47,035 --> 01:08:49,231
You've compared the handwriting
and tested the signatures?

1038
01:08:49,255 --> 01:08:51,518
Yes, invisible stamp,
everything authentic,

1039
01:08:51,562 --> 01:08:55,609
but one word only I question:
unlimited.

1040
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:58,699
It says I am to grant you
unlimited credit.

1041
01:08:58,743 --> 01:09:01,311
The house of Baron Danglars
was highly recommended

1042
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:04,401
as quite adequate to fulfill
my quick demands.

1043
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:07,665
- But if, of course--
- Of course, of course.

1044
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,232
I might modestly claim

1045
01:09:09,275 --> 01:09:11,625
that there's no stronger house
than mine in Paris,

1046
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:15,151
but please give me some idea of,
uh, what amount

1047
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:18,023
one of your 'quick demands'
might entail.

1048
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:20,068
Well, I doubt whether I shall
require more than

1049
01:09:20,112 --> 01:09:23,071
six millions from you this year
to cover my living expenses.

1050
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:25,204
Six million?

1051
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:28,164
More than it takes
to run the royal palace!

1052
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:29,339
Really, Baron?

1053
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:31,384
Yes, about six millions, I should say.

1054
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:33,908
You see, I always carry
a million with me.

1055
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:38,261
Well, I-- I shall arrange for it.

1056
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:40,828
It'll take me several days.

1057
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:42,787
You won't need any today?

1058
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:44,963
Yes. Please buy for me
this morning

1059
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:48,140
50,000 shares of British Maritime.

1060
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,838
British Maritime, 50,000 shares!

1061
01:09:50,882 --> 01:09:52,492
Is it going to raise?

1062
01:09:52,536 --> 01:09:55,234
Oh, I invest only in certainties.

1063
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:57,802
Every European banking house
of major importance

1064
01:09:57,845 --> 01:10:01,588
sends me a daily telegraph,
a service I personally finance.

1065
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,068
And, uh, British Maritime?

1066
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:05,288
Will go up at least, uh, 12 points

1067
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:06,724
within the next two days.

1068
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:09,074
If you speculate, you might do well.

1069
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:12,469
But perhaps you hesitate
to take my advice.

1070
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:14,514
Certainly not, my dear Count!

1071
01:10:14,558 --> 01:10:18,866
Even a banker likes to add
to his store of, um, pennies.

1072
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:23,175
Um, I'll take, um, fi-- er,
10,000 shares myself

1073
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,611
to prove my confidence.

1074
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:27,135
As you wish.
The market's open.

1075
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:29,486
Good morning, Baron.

1076
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:31,270
Uh, good morning, Excellency.

1077
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:34,360
My office, my reserves, my-- my--

1078
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:36,623
Well, everything I have
is at your service.

1079
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:54,119
The respected Baron Danglars, eh?

1080
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:56,381
Cheat.

1081
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:01,038
Hypocrite.

1082
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:06,870
Skunk.

1083
01:11:08,046 --> 01:11:09,046
Skunk.

1084
01:11:10,788 --> 01:11:12,093
And up it went.

1085
01:11:12,137 --> 01:11:15,532
Twelve points in two days,
exactly as he said.

1086
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:16,576
I sold.

1087
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,839
And profited 120,000 francs.

1088
01:11:18,883 --> 01:11:20,232
And never let us profit.

1089
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,713
Oh, suppose I'd have risked
your money and lost.

1090
01:11:22,756 --> 01:11:25,019
How you'd have cried.
You always do.

1091
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:26,107
Well, next time--

1092
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:27,718
If his buying orders go through you--

1093
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:29,720
Yes, yes, yes.
When he buys, we buy.

1094
01:11:29,763 --> 01:11:31,199
When he sells, we sell.

1095
01:11:31,243 --> 01:11:33,332
Perfectly simple and perfectly honest.

1096
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:36,553
Besides, he's invited me
to participate.

1097
01:11:36,596 --> 01:11:38,076
Gives me tips.

1098
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:39,512
I think he likes me.

1099
01:11:41,775 --> 01:11:44,909
Mondego's vanity will blind him
to my motives.

1100
01:11:44,952 --> 01:11:47,215
Danglars we'll stuff with profits

1101
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:49,566
till we're ready to pluck the goose.

1102
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:52,177
But de Villefort is shrewd.

1103
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,179
If he should get suspicious,

1104
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:56,224
and put his pack
of secret service agents

1105
01:11:56,268 --> 01:11:57,313
on my trail--

1106
01:11:58,792 --> 01:11:59,792
Come in.

1107
01:12:00,664 --> 01:12:02,753
Mssr. Fouquet
to see Your Excellency.

1108
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:03,710
Mssr. Fouquet!

1109
01:12:03,754 --> 01:12:04,537
You know who he is?

1110
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:05,582
Who doesn't?

1111
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,018
The greatest detective in Europe!

1112
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:09,107
- Show Mssr. Fouquet in.
- But, uh--

1113
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:11,239
We'll find out if he lives
up to his reputation.

1114
01:12:14,678 --> 01:12:15,678
Your Excellency.

1115
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,336
Oh, this is Mssr. Jacopo,
my personal confidant.

1116
01:12:20,379 --> 01:12:21,598
You're at liberty to speak.

1117
01:12:22,903 --> 01:12:24,470
I just returned from Marseilles

1118
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:26,342
with a complete record
of Edmond Dantes

1119
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:27,604
from his birth to his death.

1120
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,866
He is dead, then?

1121
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:33,174
Yes. I found that he'd lived
for 16 years

1122
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:34,543
after he was entered as dead
in the record.

1123
01:12:34,567 --> 01:12:35,829
But finally he was drowned

1124
01:12:35,873 --> 01:12:38,441
while cleverly trying
to effect his escape.

1125
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:40,268
There can be no doubt, then?
He drowned?

1126
01:12:40,312 --> 01:12:43,707
It would be a miracle
if he got out of that sack.

1127
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,143
But, uh--

1128
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:46,622
But?

1129
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:51,018
I'm surprised to hear you
use a "but", Mssr. Fouquet.

1130
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:52,977
I am informed that he lived

1131
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,414
and was picked up
by Italian smugglers,

1132
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:56,894
becoming a member of their crew.

1133
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:59,679
Well, it's possible, but--

1134
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:01,942
Excuse me.

1135
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:03,485
I just said that it might be possible,

1136
01:13:03,509 --> 01:13:05,642
but if it is, I'll find him!

1137
01:13:12,213 --> 01:13:13,345
He gave me a scare.

1138
01:13:14,433 --> 01:13:16,000
I didn't know he was working for you.

1139
01:13:16,043 --> 01:13:17,107
I couldn't afford to have him

1140
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:18,916
working for anyone else, now could I?

1141
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:22,049
I must find out what they
can find out about me.

1142
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:24,269
I'm saving de Villefort the trouble.

1143
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:26,967
The time will come when I'll
want him to know who I am.

1144
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:30,318
I'll hand him the information
on a silver platter.

1145
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:31,537
This investigation business

1146
01:13:31,581 --> 01:13:33,626
has gotten to be an awful habit
with you!

1147
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,411
You even investigate yourself!

1148
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:37,456
You want everyone to know who you are?

1149
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,024
One day I'll want to publish it
to the whole world.

1150
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:42,766
So tomorrow, I'm going to buy
a newspaper.

1151
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:49,512
Using my house as a rendezvous, eh?

1152
01:13:49,555 --> 01:13:50,991
What'll your father say to that?

1153
01:13:51,035 --> 01:13:52,297
If you knew how desperately

1154
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,386
we try to meet each other unobserved.

1155
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:02,089
- Shall I?
- Please.

1156
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:03,655
I have an idea.

1157
01:14:04,918 --> 01:14:07,704
Is it a plan to reconcile
our fathers to our marriage?

1158
01:14:07,747 --> 01:14:09,445
You're the only one who can do it.

1159
01:14:09,488 --> 01:14:11,621
They're bursting with admiration
for you.

1160
01:14:11,664 --> 01:14:12,796
Really?

1161
01:14:12,839 --> 01:14:14,667
Well, this is a different plan.

1162
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:19,019
To repay the kindness shown to
me in Paris, I'm giving a ball.

1163
01:14:19,063 --> 01:14:20,456
My guest of honor is to be

1164
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:22,501
the father of my first
Parisian friend,

1165
01:14:22,545 --> 01:14:24,198
Count de Mondego.

1166
01:14:24,242 --> 01:14:26,462
Oh, how Father will be puffed up
about that.

1167
01:14:27,854 --> 01:14:30,378
I thought it particularly
apropos to combine with it

1168
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:32,990
an Albanian pageant
and series of tableaux

1169
01:14:33,033 --> 01:14:35,688
representing the court of Ali Pasha

1170
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:39,126
at which your father gained such
extraordinary fame and honors.

1171
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:40,606
Isn't it exciting, Albert?

1172
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,570
Of course, I shall want
your mother's permission.

1173
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:44,175
Can you get it for me, do you think?

1174
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:47,526
No, sir, I'm-- I'm afraid you'll
have to get that yourself.

1175
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:50,137
She wondered why you never
called after that first day.

1176
01:14:51,312 --> 01:14:52,749
Well, I shall be privileged.

1177
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:53,792
Tomorrow afternoon?

1178
01:14:55,273 --> 01:14:58,058
Well, now business is over,
let's talk about your future.

1179
01:14:58,102 --> 01:14:59,582
If you could only get Father...

1180
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,825
- Don't you think you could--?
- ...to listen to reason!

1181
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:47,934
I thought there must be
something like this somewhere.

1182
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:49,370
I've had it ever since,

1183
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:52,504
for many years.

1184
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,638
Well, it speaks the truth.
Edmond Dantes is dead.

1185
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,814
Then, who is this
Count de Monte Cristo

1186
01:15:57,857 --> 01:15:59,598
who so closely resembles him?

1187
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:02,732
The resemblance has
been noted by no one but you.

1188
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:06,997
He is, in fact,
to answer your question,

1189
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,783
a person so utterly unlike
a man named Dantes

1190
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:13,786
that they might have been
born of different parents.

1191
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:16,267
Even the soul is not the same.

1192
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,008
I can believe that.

1193
01:16:27,974 --> 01:16:31,064
The present is the only time
that holds the truth.

1194
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:34,198
The past is lies,
with this for witness.

1195
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:40,117
It was once truth that Edmond
and Mercedes loved each other.

1196
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,249
Today that truth is false,

1197
01:16:43,555 --> 01:16:45,078
and how fortunate it is.

1198
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:50,736
For now we find her
not a simple sailor's wife,

1199
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,780
but a countess,

1200
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:53,913
consort of a noble,

1201
01:16:54,697 --> 01:16:56,002
while Dantes,

1202
01:16:57,047 --> 01:17:00,311
one life finished, lives another.

1203
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:02,835
The past for you dies very easily.

1204
01:17:05,403 --> 01:17:06,447
Easily?

1205
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,626
What's dead is dead.

1206
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,846
In that respect, I'm a fatalist.

1207
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,544
Then, tell me,
Mssr. Fatalistic Count,

1208
01:17:16,588 --> 01:17:18,634
what does your heart crave now?

1209
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:20,723
Intelligence, first of all.

1210
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:24,161
Then, perhaps,
simply to live gracefully.

1211
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:25,641
Hence the graceful gesture

1212
01:17:25,684 --> 01:17:28,339
of honoring my husband
with a regal entertainment.

1213
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:29,557
Yes.

1214
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:32,648
And why my husband
out of all the others?

1215
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:34,824
Because I have a real affection
for his son,

1216
01:17:36,216 --> 01:17:38,001
whom I met by chance in Rome

1217
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:41,004
and further, because
I hold his charming wife

1218
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:43,659
in great esteem and admiration.

1219
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:48,272
Forgive me for ever mistrusting
your motives.

1220
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:54,365
Henceforth, the Count de Monte Cristo

1221
01:17:54,408 --> 01:17:57,324
and the Countess de Mondego
will meet and greet each other

1222
01:17:57,368 --> 01:17:59,979
with nothing but the airy,
meaningless compliments

1223
01:18:00,023 --> 01:18:01,633
that befit their social position.

1224
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:04,854
And Edmond Dantes?

1225
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:07,726
Is dead.
I have forgotten him.

1226
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:08,771
Good.

1227
01:18:11,295 --> 01:18:13,079
I shall look forward to receiving

1228
01:18:13,123 --> 01:18:15,560
the most gracious Countess
as my guest.

1229
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,476
I appreciate the significant honor

1230
01:18:18,519 --> 01:18:20,304
you are bestowing on both the Count

1231
01:18:20,347 --> 01:18:21,784
and your obedient servant.

1232
01:18:58,168 --> 01:19:00,866
The Marquis and Marquise
of Fleur-de-Couer...

1233
01:19:04,957 --> 01:19:07,264
Mssr. le Colonel Barbizan.

1234
01:19:07,307 --> 01:19:08,787
Ah, my Ali Pasha.

1235
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:11,268
It took them two hours
at the Comedie Francaise

1236
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:12,399
to put on my makeup.

1237
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:15,315
Is my beard long enough?

1238
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:17,970
To me, perfect, but Mondego
would know more about that.

1239
01:19:18,014 --> 01:19:19,406
How does he look to you?

1240
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:22,496
Remarkable. Excellent.
Very good. Very good indeed.

1241
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,584
Thank you.

1242
01:19:23,628 --> 01:19:25,456
The Great Duke of Worthingham.

1243
01:20:08,716 --> 01:20:11,241
Lavish, that's what it is, lavish!

1244
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:14,505
You are the only man in Paris
that never counts the cost!

1245
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:16,376
Except you, Danglars.

1246
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,901
Oh, Baron Danglars, you've
met Count de Mondego?

1247
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,859
- Yes.
- Ooh, of course, of course.

1248
01:20:20,903 --> 01:20:24,645
All three of us originally
came from Marseilles.

1249
01:20:24,689 --> 01:20:27,170
Really? To think that one city

1250
01:20:27,213 --> 01:20:31,217
boasts the birth place
of three such eminent men.

1251
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:33,089
I hope I may have
the privilege one day

1252
01:20:33,132 --> 01:20:34,612
of entertaining in your honor, too,

1253
01:20:34,655 --> 01:20:35,613
Mssr. de Villefort.

1254
01:20:35,656 --> 01:20:37,615
You're too kind.

1255
01:20:39,356 --> 01:20:40,618
And, Baron Danglars,

1256
01:20:40,661 --> 01:20:42,838
I am planning for you a similar affair

1257
01:20:42,881 --> 01:20:45,101
which I hope will do you justice.

1258
01:20:45,144 --> 01:20:48,234
Ooh, my, my, my!
I-- I shall be most grateful.

1259
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:52,238
One, two, three of you I must honor.

1260
01:20:52,282 --> 01:20:53,370
Will you excuse me?

1261
01:20:56,112 --> 01:20:57,678
Isn't he amazing, eh?

1262
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:00,594
- Beauchamp.
- Good evening, Excellency.

1263
01:21:00,638 --> 01:21:02,919
When I bought your newspaper,
I told you from time to time

1264
01:21:02,945 --> 01:21:04,729
I'd give you certain truths to print.

1265
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:07,688
Watch closely what goes on,
then seek me out.

1266
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:15,131
The first tableau portrays
His Excellency

1267
01:21:15,174 --> 01:21:16,741
the Count de Mondego,

1268
01:21:16,784 --> 01:21:19,787
presenting his credentials
as French ambassador

1269
01:21:19,831 --> 01:21:21,137
to Ali Pasha.

1270
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:30,537
Bravo! Bravo!

1271
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:40,677
Bravo!

1272
01:21:41,592 --> 01:21:45,552
We will now see Ali Pasha
in his harem.

1273
01:22:04,745 --> 01:22:05,833
Look, Emily!

1274
01:22:05,877 --> 01:22:08,575
There's Hortense DeBre
and Reni Latour.

1275
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:11,274
Both have been mistresses of Mondego.

1276
01:22:14,842 --> 01:22:18,672
This isn't Ali Pasha's harem,
it's Mondego's.

1277
01:22:24,504 --> 01:22:26,593
Princess Haydee, go now
and mingle with the guests.

1278
01:22:26,637 --> 01:22:28,291
After the curtains part,

1279
01:22:28,334 --> 01:22:30,771
look carefully at the tableau
then run quickly onto the stage

1280
01:22:30,815 --> 01:22:33,252
and speak in a loud, clear voice
whatever comes to your lips.

1281
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:42,087
The final tableau represents

1282
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:45,743
Count de Mondego's valiant
but vain efforts

1283
01:22:45,786 --> 01:22:49,573
to save the life of Ali Pasha
at the hands of the Turks.

1284
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:00,540
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1285
01:23:03,674 --> 01:23:04,674
Bravo!

1286
01:23:05,067 --> 01:23:06,285
That's a lie!

1287
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:09,071
I am Ali Pasha's daughter.

1288
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:11,073
The Count de Mondego betrayed him!

1289
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:12,116
Betrayed France!

1290
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,467
Sold my father to the Turks,

1291
01:23:14,511 --> 01:23:17,209
who paid him money
to arrange my father's death!

1292
01:23:17,253 --> 01:23:18,994
Then he killed all the witnesses

1293
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:22,084
and sold me and my mother
into slavery!

1294
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:23,737
You killed my father!

1295
01:23:23,781 --> 01:23:25,000
Mme, please! Please!

1296
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:31,528
Count de Mondego, honored guests,

1297
01:23:31,571 --> 01:23:33,834
please forgive this
unfortunate occurrence.

1298
01:23:33,878 --> 01:23:36,663
This fanatic woman entered here
under veiled disguise.

1299
01:23:36,707 --> 01:23:37,747
I have ordered her arrest.

1300
01:23:39,057 --> 01:23:42,060
Every great man is attacked
by crazed imposters.

1301
01:23:42,104 --> 01:23:43,757
I hope that Count de Mondego
will accept

1302
01:23:43,801 --> 01:23:46,282
the deep apologies of my house.

1303
01:23:46,325 --> 01:23:49,198
His valiant record is
a matter of history.

1304
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:51,852
We are here to do him honor.

1305
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,120
Who was that crazy woman?

1306
01:23:58,163 --> 01:23:59,575
I'll have her brought to you
for questioning.

1307
01:23:59,599 --> 01:24:01,166
Oh, no, no. Don't, don't.
Please don't.

1308
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,038
It's perhaps best
to forget the whole affair.

1309
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:05,388
That's very kind of you.
Shall we not dance?

1310
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:17,965
How perfectly ridiculous.

1311
01:24:18,966 --> 01:24:20,446
What a shock for you, my dear.

1312
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:24,537
How charmingly Monte Cristo
handled it.

1313
01:24:27,323 --> 01:24:28,193
- Excellency!
- Beauchamp...

1314
01:24:28,237 --> 01:24:29,803
I was looking for you.

1315
01:24:29,847 --> 01:24:32,128
A man is waiting at your office
with a locked dispatch box

1316
01:24:32,154 --> 01:24:33,416
for which this is the key.

1317
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:35,809
The box contains signed evidence
and testimony

1318
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:37,309
that this is the real Princess Haydee

1319
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:38,571
and that what she said is true.

1320
01:24:38,595 --> 01:24:40,205
Devote your entire paper to it.

1321
01:24:40,249 --> 01:24:42,251
Prepare for a jump in circulation

1322
01:24:42,294 --> 01:24:43,904
and deliver the first copy
off the press

1323
01:24:43,948 --> 01:24:45,123
by special messenger

1324
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:47,299
into the hands of Count de Mondego.

1325
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:55,002
I regret the hour,

1326
01:24:55,046 --> 01:24:57,048
but I have urgent need
of the Count's advice.

1327
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:59,181
He has just retired, Your Excellency.

1328
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:00,791
I shouldn't dare disturb him now.

1329
01:25:00,834 --> 01:25:04,186
However, he always rises at six.

1330
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:05,622
I'll wait.

1331
01:26:23,047 --> 01:26:24,788
You're up early, Mondego.

1332
01:26:25,702 --> 01:26:26,355
Where are you?

1333
01:26:26,398 --> 01:26:27,660
Don't shoot.

1334
01:26:27,704 --> 01:26:29,464
You've only one bullet
and would surely miss.

1335
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,186
Where are you?

1336
01:26:34,537 --> 01:26:37,061
If you could see as I can in the dark,

1337
01:26:37,104 --> 01:26:40,456
you would observe my pistol
aimed carefully at your head.

1338
01:26:42,284 --> 01:26:44,634
Two steps to your right
you will find a table.

1339
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,769
Now first put down your pistol.

1340
01:26:49,813 --> 01:26:51,815
It has a quick trigger
and your hand is shaking.

1341
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:54,600
Thank you.

1342
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:56,863
To your right
on the edge of the table,

1343
01:26:56,907 --> 01:26:58,082
you'll find some matches.

1344
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:03,218
When I say, "Ready", strike a light.

1345
01:27:05,045 --> 01:27:06,045
Ready.

1346
01:27:07,961 --> 01:27:10,225
I'm glad you brought the pistol.
I didn't have one.

1347
01:27:11,878 --> 01:27:13,228
Will you light the candle there?

1348
01:27:17,188 --> 01:27:20,191
Another one. I like to see
the faces of my guests.

1349
01:27:23,063 --> 01:27:25,109
Forgive my precautions
for saving my life.

1350
01:27:25,152 --> 01:27:26,632
You intended to take it, didn't you?

1351
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:30,114
I wouldn't have killed you
without first

1352
01:27:30,157 --> 01:27:32,508
forcing from you a full explanation.

1353
01:27:32,551 --> 01:27:34,074
After which, I would've given you

1354
01:27:34,118 --> 01:27:35,554
your choice of weapons.

1355
01:27:35,598 --> 01:27:36,947
As you did Ali Pasha?

1356
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:40,559
You're avenging Ali Pasha, then?

1357
01:27:40,603 --> 01:27:41,603
No.

1358
01:27:43,214 --> 01:27:44,259
Myself.

1359
01:27:46,783 --> 01:27:48,959
I don't recall that our paths
ever crossed

1360
01:27:49,002 --> 01:27:50,656
before three months ago.

1361
01:27:51,875 --> 01:27:53,746
As Monte Cristo, no.

1362
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,489
Who are you, then?

1363
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:01,145
Obviously, some imposter
posing as a count.

1364
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:04,322
Who else are you?

1365
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:07,412
Before I tell you, Mondego,

1366
01:28:08,457 --> 01:28:10,415
what is your choice of weapons?

1367
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:12,678
Pistols, if you will,

1368
01:28:12,722 --> 01:28:16,943
but I prefer not to awaken Paris
at such an early hour.

1369
01:28:16,987 --> 01:28:20,033
Swords? Daggers? Fists?

1370
01:28:20,077 --> 01:28:22,079
Swords would suit me perfectly.

1371
01:28:23,385 --> 01:28:24,690
Swords, then.

1372
01:28:26,388 --> 01:28:27,693
I have them here.

1373
01:28:30,566 --> 01:28:32,698
A trick I learned to fool the jailors

1374
01:28:32,742 --> 01:28:36,267
while tunneling myself
out of the Chateau d'If.

1375
01:28:38,965 --> 01:28:39,965
Yes,

1376
01:28:40,402 --> 01:28:41,751
the Chateau d'If.

1377
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,059
Does that clue mean nothing to you?

1378
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:47,322
Dust off your memory.

1379
01:28:48,801 --> 01:28:50,281
Go back 20 years.

1380
01:28:51,413 --> 01:28:53,545
Back to the days
when you first discovered

1381
01:28:53,589 --> 01:28:57,419
that a life meant nothing
if it furthered your ambition.

1382
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:58,462
Think.

1383
01:28:59,508 --> 01:29:00,508
Think.

1384
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,904
An innocent, unsophisticated sailor

1385
01:29:04,948 --> 01:29:06,950
whose name was--

1386
01:29:06,993 --> 01:29:08,386
- Dantes!
- Right!

1387
01:29:10,736 --> 01:29:12,434
Edmond Dantes.

1388
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:16,002
Simple, isn't it?

1389
01:29:16,046 --> 01:29:17,352
Very simple, indeed.

1390
01:29:18,918 --> 01:29:20,703
I might have questioned my skill

1391
01:29:20,746 --> 01:29:22,705
against the formidable Monte Cristo,

1392
01:29:22,748 --> 01:29:24,446
but against Edmond Dantes?

1393
01:29:25,403 --> 01:29:26,403
Swords.

1394
01:29:36,936 --> 01:29:39,896
You very cleverly planned
my destruction, Dantes,

1395
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:43,116
but you won't have the pleasure
of living to see it.

1396
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,685
Good. I'm accustomed to fighting
as the underdog.

1397
01:30:49,356 --> 01:30:52,577
It's not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.

1398
01:30:56,842 --> 01:30:59,715
Jacopo, take Count de Mondego
to his home in my carriage.

1399
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,459
Take him secretly
to his garden entrance.

1400
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:06,548
By this time, his front door
is surely besieged

1401
01:31:06,591 --> 01:31:08,332
by reporters from every newspaper

1402
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:09,812
and perhaps the police.

1403
01:31:11,553 --> 01:31:13,380
He is to communicate with no one.

1404
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:15,991
Good morning.

1405
01:31:32,138 --> 01:31:33,879
There he is! There he is!

1406
01:31:50,069 --> 01:31:53,203
Your Excellency. Baron Danglars
personally visited

1407
01:31:53,246 --> 01:31:56,162
my office this morning
and gave me this.

1408
01:31:56,206 --> 01:31:59,339
It's a thousand francs, sir,
in return for which,

1409
01:31:59,383 --> 01:32:00,645
I was to send him copies

1410
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:03,300
of all telegraph messages
addressed to you.

1411
01:32:03,343 --> 01:32:05,563
Keep it for your children's education.

1412
01:32:05,607 --> 01:32:06,825
Thank you, sir.

1413
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:09,436
Send the Baron the copies
as he requested.

1414
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,483
I'll see that he gets
the proper information.

1415
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,528
Yes, sir.

1416
01:32:14,877 --> 01:32:16,356
"Monte Cristo."

1417
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,882
"Future political situation
makes Anglo-Spanish shares

1418
01:32:19,925 --> 01:32:20,925
wonderful investment."

1419
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,363
"Suggest unlimited buying."

1420
01:32:23,407 --> 01:32:24,582
"Thompson and French."

1421
01:32:26,192 --> 01:32:28,151
This is what I've been waiting for.

1422
01:32:29,326 --> 01:32:31,328
Start buying at once!

1423
01:32:31,371 --> 01:32:32,547
Investing de Villefort

1424
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,897
and other special clients
money as well?

1425
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:35,985
No.

1426
01:32:36,028 --> 01:32:37,334
Only mine.

1427
01:32:37,377 --> 01:32:39,118
- Oh, but the risk--
- Risk?

1428
01:32:40,424 --> 01:32:42,469
This is one of Monte Cristo's
certainties.

1429
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:44,193
Haven't we made money
on every one of them?

1430
01:32:45,908 --> 01:32:50,260
Convert all my holdings
into Anglo-Spanish.

1431
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:52,741
All?

1432
01:32:53,829 --> 01:32:54,873
All.

1433
01:32:58,834 --> 01:33:00,923
I've investigated carefully!

1434
01:33:00,966 --> 01:33:05,014
Neither Rothschild nor Lorenti
is buying Anglo-Spanish.

1435
01:33:05,057 --> 01:33:06,581
They don't know everything.

1436
01:33:06,624 --> 01:33:08,539
I'm tired of playing second fiddle

1437
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,585
to Rothschild, Lorenti, Monte Cristo!

1438
01:33:10,628 --> 01:33:12,195
After this when we meet,

1439
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:14,980
I want them to take their hats
off first!

1440
01:33:15,024 --> 01:33:16,025
Buy!

1441
01:33:17,461 --> 01:33:18,593
Buy!

1442
01:33:26,296 --> 01:33:27,906
Show Baron Danglars in.

1443
01:33:30,953 --> 01:33:33,912
Anglo-Spanish has collapsed!
I'm ruined!

1444
01:33:33,956 --> 01:33:35,044
We're both ruined!

1445
01:33:35,087 --> 01:33:36,087
Why?

1446
01:33:36,523 --> 01:33:37,568
I knew it would collapse.

1447
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:38,806
You knew?
But you've been buying!

1448
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:40,136
No.

1449
01:33:40,179 --> 01:33:42,529
But Thompson and French--
But their advice was--

1450
01:33:42,573 --> 01:33:45,054
I received their advice,
but their message was in code.

1451
01:33:45,097 --> 01:33:47,491
Though it said to buy,
it really meant to sell.

1452
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,494
You see, Thompson and French

1453
01:33:50,537 --> 01:33:53,497
is owned by a man named Edmond Dantes.

1454
01:33:55,673 --> 01:33:56,673
Who?

1455
01:33:57,370 --> 01:33:58,633
Monte Cristo.

1456
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:02,071
You said--

1457
01:34:02,114 --> 01:34:03,246
Edmond Dantes.

1458
01:34:03,812 --> 01:34:04,900
Monte Cristo.

1459
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:07,642
They're the same, Danglars.

1460
01:34:24,006 --> 01:34:26,573
- Is he alive?
- Yes, but--

1461
01:34:26,617 --> 01:34:28,184
Call a doctor.

1462
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:36,496
He's lost his mind.

1463
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:38,934
- Permanently?
- Irretrievably.

1464
01:34:41,414 --> 01:34:42,415
Marseilles...

1465
01:34:43,025 --> 01:34:44,025
Morrel...

1466
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:45,984
Dantes...

1467
01:34:46,028 --> 01:34:47,420
Chateau d'If.

1468
01:34:49,335 --> 01:34:51,555
A mental suicide, doctor.

1469
01:34:51,598 --> 01:34:53,383
- Mental suicide?
- Yes.

1470
01:34:53,426 --> 01:34:55,254
He destroyed his mind with an overdose

1471
01:34:55,298 --> 01:34:56,821
of two deadly poisons.

1472
01:34:56,865 --> 01:34:57,866
Poisons?

1473
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,912
Avarice and greed.

1474
01:35:16,232 --> 01:35:19,235
Welcome, Albert.
It's been a long time.

1475
01:35:19,278 --> 01:35:21,672
I've just returned from Marseilles.

1476
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,630
We buried my father there.

1477
01:35:23,674 --> 01:35:25,937
Well, yes, I know. I--

1478
01:35:25,981 --> 01:35:28,461
There are certain circumstances
leading to my father's death

1479
01:35:28,505 --> 01:35:29,941
I don't quite understand.

1480
01:35:29,985 --> 01:35:32,727
That's why I've come to you
who knows everything.

1481
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:34,076
Surely. If I can--

1482
01:35:34,119 --> 01:35:36,034
My friends report
that this Princess Haydee

1483
01:35:36,078 --> 01:35:38,210
has been seen with you
in your carriage several times.

1484
01:35:38,254 --> 01:35:39,342
That's true.

1485
01:35:39,385 --> 01:35:41,736
She is here now, living in your house.

1486
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:42,954
At present, yes, but--

1487
01:35:42,998 --> 01:35:44,390
Do you deny that you had

1488
01:35:44,434 --> 01:35:47,742
previous knowledge of her intent
to expose my father?

1489
01:35:47,785 --> 01:35:50,875
Do you deny that he visited you
the morning of his death,

1490
01:35:50,919 --> 01:35:52,703
was returned home in your carriage

1491
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,009
under guard and--

1492
01:35:55,184 --> 01:35:57,839
and a few minutes later shot himself?

1493
01:35:57,882 --> 01:36:00,145
He came to me for help
I couldn't give.

1494
01:36:01,494 --> 01:36:03,409
Your open association
with Princess Haydee

1495
01:36:03,453 --> 01:36:06,325
is an intolerable affront
to the family of Mondego

1496
01:36:06,369 --> 01:36:07,607
and one that can only be appeased by--

1497
01:36:07,631 --> 01:36:08,631
Stop!

1498
01:36:09,851 --> 01:36:10,852
Don't say it.

1499
01:36:11,853 --> 01:36:13,202
Don't say it, Albert.

1500
01:36:14,638 --> 01:36:15,944
Don't challenge me.

1501
01:36:16,945 --> 01:36:18,511
Rather anyone but you.

1502
01:36:19,948 --> 01:36:22,472
I have other friends who respect me.

1503
01:36:23,734 --> 01:36:25,059
I must prove to them that running away

1504
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:27,520
is not the habit of all Mondegos.

1505
01:36:27,564 --> 01:36:29,609
If killing me will save your honor--

1506
01:36:29,653 --> 01:36:31,046
I don't wish to kill you.

1507
01:36:33,526 --> 01:36:34,526
But--

1508
01:36:34,963 --> 01:36:36,616
Well, then, we might--

1509
01:36:37,574 --> 01:36:39,228
I see what you're thinking.

1510
01:36:40,403 --> 01:36:42,884
You're suggesting a bloodless duel.

1511
01:36:42,927 --> 01:36:45,887
Then, all my life I--
I live a lie,

1512
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:49,673
knowing that I placed cowardice
ahead of honor.

1513
01:36:49,716 --> 01:36:51,675
Even my father wouldn't stoop to that.

1514
01:36:53,633 --> 01:36:54,852
I await your pleasure.

1515
01:36:57,724 --> 01:36:58,724
Tomorrow at dawn.

1516
01:36:59,552 --> 01:37:03,469
The place and details
my seconds will arrange.

1517
01:37:03,513 --> 01:37:05,558
They will present themselves
this afternoon.

1518
01:37:08,561 --> 01:37:09,780
Good morning, sir.

1519
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,348
Good morning.

1520
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:25,491
- Something's happened?
- Yes.

1521
01:37:25,535 --> 01:37:27,537
Something admirable and terrible,

1522
01:37:29,147 --> 01:37:31,236
something I never planned.

1523
01:37:46,077 --> 01:37:48,253
Your meeting with Albert is at seven.

1524
01:37:48,297 --> 01:37:49,559
It is already five.

1525
01:37:49,602 --> 01:37:52,040
You only have an hour left for rest.

1526
01:37:56,566 --> 01:37:59,438
Will you use his
duelling pistols or yours?

1527
01:37:59,482 --> 01:38:00,787
His, I suspect.

1528
01:38:00,831 --> 01:38:02,441
What difference does it make?

1529
01:38:02,485 --> 01:38:03,921
Mssr. Fouquet is waiting.

1530
01:38:07,577 --> 01:38:10,275
here is the link
that Fouquet's chain lacks.

1531
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:11,407
Tell him to go at once

1532
01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:14,192
and drag de Villefort from his bed.

1533
01:38:14,236 --> 01:38:16,194
The great King's Attorney
won't be sleepy long

1534
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:17,761
when he has in his hands the evidence

1535
01:38:17,804 --> 01:38:19,284
that'll send me back to prison.

1536
01:38:21,373 --> 01:38:25,595
If I survive the duel, I shall
go through with the trial.

1537
01:38:25,638 --> 01:38:28,598
- If I die--
- De Villefort will go free.

1538
01:38:31,731 --> 01:38:32,819
Yes.

1539
01:38:35,126 --> 01:38:38,173
This chest contains my past, my plans,

1540
01:38:38,216 --> 01:38:40,262
and my unfinished business.

1541
01:38:41,698 --> 01:38:44,135
Also my will, which makes provisions

1542
01:38:44,179 --> 01:38:45,702
for my friends, servants,

1543
01:38:46,659 --> 01:38:47,659
and you,

1544
01:38:49,532 --> 01:38:50,968
my trusted confidant.

1545
01:38:52,143 --> 01:38:53,143
Yep.

1546
01:38:56,713 --> 01:38:58,323
My house is now in order.

1547
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:11,858
Yes, I'll see her at once.

1548
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,835
Edmond, don't kill my boy.

1549
01:39:33,097 --> 01:39:35,099
- He told you.
- Not a word.

1550
01:39:35,143 --> 01:39:37,754
Bernard, one of his seconds,
thought I ought to know.

1551
01:39:37,797 --> 01:39:38,797
I see.

1552
01:39:42,063 --> 01:39:43,760
I wonder if you do.

1553
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:46,980
No.

1554
01:39:47,459 --> 01:39:48,808
I'm the only one who sees.

1555
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,942
Sees you as you were.

1556
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:55,032
And sees you as you are now,
devoid of every human feeling,

1557
01:39:55,076 --> 01:39:56,686
bent upon destroying everything

1558
01:39:56,729 --> 01:39:58,514
that lies upon your path of vengeance.

1559
01:39:58,557 --> 01:40:01,734
Please believe I've put my task
above the mean level

1560
01:40:01,778 --> 01:40:03,258
of personal vengeance.

1561
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:06,913
I am exposing criminals,

1562
01:40:06,957 --> 01:40:09,090
not for their sins against myself,

1563
01:40:09,133 --> 01:40:12,354
but for their black injustices
to others.

1564
01:40:12,397 --> 01:40:14,182
Not only for what they have done,

1565
01:40:14,225 --> 01:40:16,401
but for what they continue to do.

1566
01:40:17,707 --> 01:40:20,057
They are the ones devoid
of all humanity,

1567
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:22,668
the ones that profited
by the sufferings of others.

1568
01:40:24,714 --> 01:40:27,021
Whom will it profit
if you kill my son?

1569
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:32,156
Surely you don't think this duel
part of my design?

1570
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,679
What else am I to think?

1571
01:40:33,723 --> 01:40:36,465
Knowingly how skillfully you
have destroyed the others.

1572
01:40:44,734 --> 01:40:48,607
Let me tell you about Albert.
He worships you.

1573
01:40:48,651 --> 01:40:51,001
Never in his life has he felt
such a strong affection

1574
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,176
for anyone but me.

1575
01:40:53,917 --> 01:40:55,614
He never understood his father.

1576
01:40:55,658 --> 01:40:58,574
There was no bond of sympathy
between them.

1577
01:40:58,617 --> 01:40:59,617
Why?

1578
01:41:00,402 --> 01:41:02,230
'Cause that was a part of my design.

1579
01:41:04,232 --> 01:41:06,843
I reared him in the image
of the man I loved.

1580
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:11,630
He is the son Edmond Dantes
would have had.

1581
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:16,940
I had hoped that he'd be claimed
by Monte Cristo.

1582
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:21,684
I claimed him long ago, Mercedes.

1583
01:41:27,255 --> 01:41:30,171
But the situation now is desperate.

1584
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:34,392
His honor is at stake.
We must protect it.

1585
01:41:34,436 --> 01:41:36,264
He has a growing fear
that he'll be like--

1586
01:41:36,307 --> 01:41:37,526
I know. His father.

1587
01:41:37,569 --> 01:41:39,136
That he'll be thought a coward.

1588
01:41:40,659 --> 01:41:43,271
Promise me you'll let the duel
go through.

1589
01:41:43,314 --> 01:41:45,273
For the sake of his future.

1590
01:41:45,316 --> 01:41:46,839
He must have self-respect.

1591
01:41:48,058 --> 01:41:50,234
You promise me
he'll have a future, then?

1592
01:41:51,888 --> 01:41:55,631
You really think I'd guide
my bullet to its mark?

1593
01:41:55,674 --> 01:41:56,674
No.

1594
01:41:57,459 --> 01:41:58,982
Not now I don't.

1595
01:42:02,942 --> 01:42:04,814
But you see, I had to be quite sure.

1596
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:10,385
Not for myself alone.
There's Valentine de Villefort.

1597
01:42:12,865 --> 01:42:16,391
I can't forget
that when I was her age,

1598
01:42:16,434 --> 01:42:18,262
I lost the man I loved.

1599
01:42:21,483 --> 01:42:25,051
We can't cast a shadow across
the path of Valentine.

1600
01:42:25,095 --> 01:42:27,097
I'm afraid it's already too late.

1601
01:42:28,185 --> 01:42:29,185
What?

1602
01:42:33,408 --> 01:42:35,584
Jacopo, has Fouquet left?

1603
01:42:35,627 --> 01:42:37,760
Yes, Excellency, I saw him on his way.

1604
01:42:37,803 --> 01:42:39,283
He'll be at his door by now.

1605
01:42:46,072 --> 01:42:47,639
The King's Attorney's door.

1606
01:42:48,901 --> 01:42:50,990
De Villefort is the next one
on my list.

1607
01:43:00,348 --> 01:43:03,089
If you would spare the feelings
of De Villefort's daughter,

1608
01:43:03,133 --> 01:43:06,528
tell Albert to take careful aim
and shoot to kill.

1609
01:43:16,364 --> 01:43:18,409
Gentlemen, you have your instructions.

1610
01:43:18,453 --> 01:43:21,282
Six paces, turn at my command.

1611
01:43:21,325 --> 01:43:22,325
Fire at will.

1612
01:43:23,066 --> 01:43:24,066
Ready?

1613
01:43:24,676 --> 01:43:25,676
One.

1614
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,331
Two.

1615
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:28,637
Three.

1616
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,768
Four.

1617
01:43:29,812 --> 01:43:31,030
Five.

1618
01:43:31,074 --> 01:43:32,074
Six.

1619
01:43:32,510 --> 01:43:33,510
Turn!

1620
01:43:39,952 --> 01:43:42,433
Your Excellency,
Count de Monte Cristo,

1621
01:43:42,477 --> 01:43:43,608
Count de Mondego.

1622
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:48,265
Your aim was true.
Why didn't you hold it?

1623
01:43:48,309 --> 01:43:50,006
I couldn't.

1624
01:43:50,049 --> 01:43:52,051
I'm sorry. It would've saved me
a lot of trouble.

1625
01:43:52,095 --> 01:43:54,271
Mother told me who you were.

1626
01:43:54,315 --> 01:43:55,315
I see.

1627
01:43:55,664 --> 01:43:57,056
Edmond Dantes.

1628
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:59,140
You're under arrest by order
of the King's Attorney.

1629
01:44:06,936 --> 01:44:08,459
To the jury.

1630
01:44:08,503 --> 01:44:11,375
One last close look before you
assemble to take a ballot,

1631
01:44:11,419 --> 01:44:14,335
the result of which
can never be in doubt.

1632
01:44:14,378 --> 01:44:18,904
And you, citizens of France,
look at this man,

1633
01:44:18,948 --> 01:44:20,950
who, while purporting to be
an honest sailor,

1634
01:44:20,993 --> 01:44:22,952
was in reality a spy.

1635
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:26,303
Who while imprisoned
in the Chateau d'If

1636
01:44:26,347 --> 01:44:28,349
threatened the lives of guards,

1637
01:44:28,392 --> 01:44:30,742
undermined the structure with tunnels,

1638
01:44:30,786 --> 01:44:33,832
and when he discovered the old
Abbe held a secret to a treasure

1639
01:44:33,876 --> 01:44:37,096
he perhaps caused his death
by crushing his poor body

1640
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:38,837
with great rocks.

1641
01:44:38,881 --> 01:44:40,970
Think of his fiendishly
contrived escape

1642
01:44:41,013 --> 01:44:42,493
in the burial sack,

1643
01:44:42,537 --> 01:44:44,016
his unearthing of the treasure,

1644
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:46,105
his practice of the title of Count.

1645
01:44:46,149 --> 01:44:50,284
Setting himself up as a nobleman!

1646
01:44:50,327 --> 01:44:53,939
Know him for what he is.

1647
01:44:53,983 --> 01:44:57,726
Traitor, spy, doubtless murderer,

1648
01:44:57,769 --> 01:44:59,293
companion of thieves,

1649
01:44:59,336 --> 01:45:02,034
patron of bandits, imposter,

1650
01:45:02,078 --> 01:45:06,300
and criminal at large before his king!

1651
01:45:06,343 --> 01:45:07,823
They'll send him back to prison.

1652
01:45:09,041 --> 01:45:12,610
- Why doesn't he speak?
- I don't know.

1653
01:45:12,654 --> 01:45:14,699
His defense is all prepared.

1654
01:45:14,743 --> 01:45:15,744
He won't use it.

1655
01:45:15,787 --> 01:45:17,615
The King's Attorney has concluded?

1656
01:45:18,834 --> 01:45:21,924
The Prosecution rests its case.

1657
01:45:21,967 --> 01:45:24,361
It is my duty to advise the accused

1658
01:45:24,405 --> 01:45:27,669
that if he declines
to speak in his defense,

1659
01:45:27,712 --> 01:45:30,280
the case must be judged wholly
on the testimony

1660
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:31,629
presented by the prosecution.

1661
01:45:31,673 --> 01:45:33,196
I have nothing to say.

1662
01:45:36,242 --> 01:45:38,419
- He's shielding Valentine.
- Valentine?

1663
01:45:38,462 --> 01:45:39,462
Me?

1664
01:45:40,595 --> 01:45:42,727
Come with me, my dear.
I must tell you something.

1665
01:45:46,514 --> 01:45:50,387
This court is in recess
until the jury return.

1666
01:45:53,825 --> 01:45:55,740
That was 20 years ago.

1667
01:45:58,569 --> 01:46:00,179
I thought you ought to know.

1668
01:46:07,448 --> 01:46:08,666
Court convening.

1669
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,930
Court convening.

1670
01:46:11,974 --> 01:46:15,369
Albert, quickly. I can't stay,
but I must write him a note.

1671
01:46:15,412 --> 01:46:16,412
Oh, yes.

1672
01:46:32,951 --> 01:46:34,910
Mother says you must defend yourself.

1673
01:46:34,953 --> 01:46:36,390
It isn't fair to her if you don't.

1674
01:46:37,521 --> 01:46:38,957
And it isn't fair to me.

1675
01:46:46,443 --> 01:46:48,314
The court is now in session.

1676
01:46:48,358 --> 01:46:51,361
Mssr. le President.
If it is not too late!

1677
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,798
May I have the privilege
of defending myself?

1678
01:46:53,842 --> 01:46:55,626
It is the right of every citizen.

1679
01:47:02,024 --> 01:47:05,201
Your Excellencies, Judges of France,

1680
01:47:05,244 --> 01:47:06,855
Gentlemen of the jury,

1681
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:10,685
my motives in not speaking
in my defense

1682
01:47:10,728 --> 01:47:12,034
were purely selfish.

1683
01:47:12,077 --> 01:47:15,646
I was placing self above my duty
to my fellow men.

1684
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:18,388
A duty which was made clear
to me by the--

1685
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:21,130
the spiritual vision of a saintly man.

1686
01:47:21,173 --> 01:47:22,173
The Abbe Faria.

1687
01:47:23,045 --> 01:47:26,483
As we together
for eight torturous years

1688
01:47:26,527 --> 01:47:28,442
scratched our way through solid rock

1689
01:47:28,485 --> 01:47:30,182
to reach the world again

1690
01:47:30,226 --> 01:47:33,751
in order that we might
in some small way

1691
01:47:33,795 --> 01:47:37,538
bring to the seat of trial
some inhuman humans

1692
01:47:37,581 --> 01:47:39,496
who make capital of justice.

1693
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:40,932
Mssr. le President,

1694
01:47:40,976 --> 01:47:43,413
I find all this quite
unnecessary and irrelevant.

1695
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,589
The accused is permitted to continue.

1696
01:47:45,633 --> 01:47:47,504
Without further interruption.

1697
01:47:47,548 --> 01:47:49,114
The interruption is well-timed,

1698
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:53,815
but in order to prove
Edmond Dantes innocent,

1699
01:47:53,858 --> 01:47:55,817
I must ask recourse to a witness.

1700
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:57,340
And is the witness obtainable?

1701
01:47:57,383 --> 01:47:58,689
He is here in this court.

1702
01:47:58,733 --> 01:48:00,778
Name him and he shall be called.

1703
01:48:00,822 --> 01:48:02,432
Unfortunately, the court precedent

1704
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:03,607
precludes my calling him.

1705
01:48:03,651 --> 01:48:05,609
Any precedent can be set aside.

1706
01:48:05,653 --> 01:48:06,653
Who is he?

1707
01:48:07,655 --> 01:48:09,787
- The King's Attorney.
- The King's Attorney?

1708
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:15,401
That hardly is according
to general court procedure.

1709
01:48:15,445 --> 01:48:18,056
But as Mssr. de Villefort
has already stepped down

1710
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:22,017
from his great office to
personally prosecute this case,

1711
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:24,454
I'm sure he'll agree
to set aside his cap

1712
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,543
and cloak of prosecutor long enough

1713
01:48:26,587 --> 01:48:28,023
to serve as witness.

1714
01:48:35,291 --> 01:48:37,511
Is this your signature and seal?

1715
01:48:38,468 --> 01:48:39,556
Yes.

1716
01:48:41,602 --> 01:48:44,387
It is the death certificate
of Edmond Dantes.

1717
01:48:50,175 --> 01:48:53,962
Mssr. de Villefort's been
prosecuting a dead man.

1718
01:48:56,312 --> 01:48:59,750
I was a magistrate, not a coroner.

1719
01:48:59,794 --> 01:49:02,405
Were you given to understand
that I was dead?

1720
01:49:02,448 --> 01:49:05,277
Of course, by the governor
of the Chateau d'If.

1721
01:49:05,321 --> 01:49:07,845
I apologize for the misunderstanding.

1722
01:49:09,064 --> 01:49:11,762
One more question,
Mssr. de Villefort.

1723
01:49:15,113 --> 01:49:17,681
Why did you commit me to prison
without trial?

1724
01:49:17,725 --> 01:49:20,292
Because it was to your
political advantage to do so.

1725
01:49:20,336 --> 01:49:21,946
Absurd.
I gained no advantage.

1726
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:24,601
Because you knew that if I was
given trial, your father,

1727
01:49:24,645 --> 01:49:27,430
a leader of the revolution,
would be exposed.

1728
01:49:27,473 --> 01:49:30,651
You shielded your father
and sacrificed Edmond Dantes,

1729
01:49:30,694 --> 01:49:34,089
cast him into oblivion,
pronounced him dead.

1730
01:49:34,132 --> 01:49:36,700
I acted for the good of my country

1731
01:49:36,744 --> 01:49:39,703
at a time when such traitors as Dantes

1732
01:49:39,747 --> 01:49:42,097
held the power to plunge us
into anarchy.

1733
01:49:43,707 --> 01:49:47,711
On what evidence was I convicted
of being a dangerous traitor?

1734
01:49:47,755 --> 01:49:50,235
On the most reliable testimony.

1735
01:49:50,279 --> 01:49:51,454
Whose?

1736
01:49:51,497 --> 01:49:54,675
A member of your own crew,
the super-cargo.

1737
01:49:55,893 --> 01:49:56,893
His name?

1738
01:49:57,591 --> 01:50:00,071
I've-- I've forgotten.

1739
01:50:00,115 --> 01:50:02,160
I'll refresh your memory.

1740
01:50:03,031 --> 01:50:04,728
His name was Danglars.

1741
01:50:05,511 --> 01:50:06,774
Yes, Danglars,

1742
01:50:06,817 --> 01:50:07,992
later Baron Danglars,

1743
01:50:08,036 --> 01:50:09,472
the banker.

1744
01:50:09,515 --> 01:50:13,389
Reputed to be honesty itself.
I have his record here.

1745
01:50:14,999 --> 01:50:17,045
He, to further his own ends,

1746
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:20,004
gave false testimony
to send me to prison.

1747
01:50:20,048 --> 01:50:23,225
He cheated his way to power,
looted his own bank,

1748
01:50:23,268 --> 01:50:25,183
robbed thousands of honest workers

1749
01:50:25,227 --> 01:50:26,315
of their savings,

1750
01:50:26,358 --> 01:50:28,839
and yet he was but a tool in the hands

1751
01:50:28,883 --> 01:50:30,754
of an even more despicable criminal

1752
01:50:30,798 --> 01:50:32,147
who stood behind him,

1753
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:35,280
directed his evil practice,
shared his profits,

1754
01:50:35,324 --> 01:50:36,717
protected him from justice,

1755
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:40,416
was his lifelong friend
and fellow conspirator,

1756
01:50:40,459 --> 01:50:41,939
Raymond de Villefort.

1757
01:50:46,552 --> 01:50:48,598
This is an incredible accusation.

1758
01:50:50,034 --> 01:50:52,080
I am prepared to prove it, sir.

1759
01:50:52,123 --> 01:50:55,083
This is not only an accusation,
it is a warning.

1760
01:50:55,126 --> 01:50:56,911
Danglars is finished,

1761
01:50:56,954 --> 01:50:58,782
but de Villefort goes on

1762
01:50:58,826 --> 01:51:00,871
as the power behind
that banking house,

1763
01:51:00,915 --> 01:51:02,264
and if the government

1764
01:51:02,307 --> 01:51:05,397
does not immediately investigate
the manipulations,

1765
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:08,574
the bank will collapse,
carrying with it to destruction,

1766
01:51:08,618 --> 01:51:11,708
not only thousands
upon thousands of investors,

1767
01:51:11,752 --> 01:51:16,321
but the huge funds placed there
by the National Treasury itself!

1768
01:51:16,365 --> 01:51:18,019
How can anything this criminal says

1769
01:51:18,062 --> 01:51:19,063
be used as evidence?

1770
01:51:20,151 --> 01:51:22,632
Here is the evidence of my innocence.

1771
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:24,634
Attested and reattested affidavits

1772
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:26,331
from unimpeachable authorities,

1773
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:29,204
and here is his record,

1774
01:51:29,247 --> 01:51:32,207
a complete history
of Raymond de Villefort,

1775
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:34,470
an exposure that will rock this court

1776
01:51:34,513 --> 01:51:36,907
and France to its foundations.

1777
01:51:36,951 --> 01:51:40,084
In the interests of justice we
must at least examine these.

1778
01:51:40,128 --> 01:51:41,433
This is out of order!

1779
01:51:41,477 --> 01:51:43,522
I'm being treated as a prisoner,
not as a witness.

1780
01:51:43,566 --> 01:51:44,828
I demand a trial!

1781
01:51:44,872 --> 01:51:47,265
He demands what he denied me!

1782
01:51:47,309 --> 01:51:50,181
May I ask His Majesty's
impartial judges

1783
01:51:50,225 --> 01:51:53,707
to look at this man who
so abused the privilege

1784
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:54,925
of public office,

1785
01:51:54,969 --> 01:51:57,754
who so used treachery
in place of justice,

1786
01:51:57,798 --> 01:52:00,931
who so maliciously corrupted
every phase of government

1787
01:52:00,975 --> 01:52:02,367
with his touch!

1788
01:52:02,411 --> 01:52:05,370
It is not my place to prosecute
or judge this man,

1789
01:52:05,414 --> 01:52:06,414
I am a prisoner.

1790
01:52:07,285 --> 01:52:08,983
It is within the province
of this court

1791
01:52:09,026 --> 01:52:11,681
to pronounce me innocent or guilty,

1792
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:14,510
but I have followed the path
of duty to my country

1793
01:52:14,553 --> 01:52:18,688
and my fellow men by
giving this prisoner to France.

1794
01:52:31,919 --> 01:52:34,182
- It can't be far from here.
- Mother.

1795
01:52:35,618 --> 01:52:36,662
Mother.

1796
01:52:39,371 --> 01:52:40,416
May we come up?

1797
01:52:42,223 --> 01:52:43,917
You find your own tree.

1798
01:52:44,305 --> 01:53:44,520
