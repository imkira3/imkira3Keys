1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:59,496
<i>Vacation, meant to be spent alone</i>

3
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:01,260
<i>Can't seem to get my mind off of you</i>

4
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,435
<i>Can't seem to get my mind off of you</i>

5
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,807
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,006
<i>Back here at home
there's nothing to do</i>

7
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,648
<i>Hey, Yeah, yeah</i>

8
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,151
<i>Now that I'm away</i>

9
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,155
<i>I wish I'd stayed</i>

10
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:24,186
<i>Tomorrow's a day of mine
that you want be in</i>

11
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:27,197
<i>Oh, oh, ah</i>

12
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,198
<i>Vacation, all I ever wanted</i>

13
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,293
Okay. All right, one, two, three...

14
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,462
Guys! One...

15
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,366
Hold on. Guys, freeze!

16
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,271
Aw!

17
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,472
- Where's Alvin?
- Hey, Dave.

18
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,709
- Where have you been?
- Where have I been?

19
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,308
Trying to board the ship.

20
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,251
Already done that.
Also, checked out our room,

21
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,948
dibbed the side of the bed
closest to the window,

22
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,525
ordered us a round of virgin piña coladas

23
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:57,393
and signed us up for parasailing.

24
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,293
Alvin, you're too young for parasailing.

25
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,797
I thought we were going on vacation
to have fun.

26
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,664
Don't worry,
family vacations are all about fun.

27
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,299
But first we're gonna need
to set some rules.

28
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,237
Let's start with you can't call dibs
on a bed until everyone's in the room.

29
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,331
- Good rule.
- That's right.

30
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,241
That's a good one, Simon.
All right, so that's our first rule.

31
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,608
Should we go over the rest of them?

32
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,946
Dave, come on. "Rules" is my middle name.

33
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,755
<i>No attorneys to plead my case</i>

34
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,455
<i>Illa racket ships to send
me into outer space</i>

35
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:36,330
<i>And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold</i>

36
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,527
<i>But that ain't gonna help me now</i>

37
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,865
<i>I'm trouble</i>

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,099
<i>Yeah, trouble now</i>

39
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:45,472
<i>I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town</i>

40
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,135
<i>I'm trouble</i>

41
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,775
- Hey, Dave.
- Alvin!

42
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,339
- Ha ha! Whoo!
- Whoa. Ahhh! Ahhh! Ow!

43
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,747
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

44
00:02:55,876 --> 00:03:00,848
<i>All kids are now allowed to play
an the adults-only Serenity Deck.</i>

45
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,293
<i>I'm trouble</i>

46
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,294
<i>Yeah, trouble now</i>

47
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,389
<i>I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town</i>

48
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,408
<i>You think you're right,
but you were wrong</i>

49
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:28,247
<i>You tried to take me, baby
But you knew all along</i>

50
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,481
<i>You can't take me for a ride</i>

51
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,355
<i>I'm not a fool now
So you better run and hide</i>

52
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,794
<i>I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now</i>

53
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,229
<i>I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town</i>

54
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,322
Alvin!

55
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,168
<i>I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now</i>

56
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,003
<i>I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town</i>

57
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,201
<i>I'm trouble</i>

58
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,936
<i>Yeah, trouble now</i>

59
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,503
<i>I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town</i>

60
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,812
<i>I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now</i>

61
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,581
<i>I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town</i>

62
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,782
<i>Yo! I'm the T to the R to the O-U-bull</i>

63
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,620
<i>Rock it non-stop till
the mic gets dull</i>

64
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,387
<i>Take what! want
when I want, no holding back</i>

65
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,860
<i>When I kick a ﬂow
I'm all up an the track</i>

66
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,931
<i>A to the L to the V-I-N</i>

67
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,657
<i>When I'm in town, me
and all of my friends</i>

68
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,427
<i>Gonna come through like a hurricane</i>

69
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,434
<i>Tearing down everything in my way</i>

70
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,428
<i>Alvin!</i>

71
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,673
- We talked about setting rules, Alvin.
- I'm sorry.

72
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,580
I didn't know the agreement meant no fun.

73
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,447
You're allowed to have fun.

74
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,110
When are you going to stop
acting like a child?

75
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,122
When are you going to stop
treating me like a child?

76
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,818
I'll stop treating you like a child
when you start acting like a grown-up!

77
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,124
I'll start acting like a grown-up
when you start...

78
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,892
<i>I whip my tailback and forth
I whip my tailback and forth</i>

79
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,399
<i>I whip my tail back and forth</i>

80
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,366
<i>I whip my tail back and forth</i>

81
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,536
- Hey, girls, not now, please, okay?
- Aw.

82
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,937
- Lame!
- Sorry, Dave.

83
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,599
I need to get ready
for dinner with the captain.

84
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,200
We're having dinner
with the captain?

85
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,439
No, I am. You're staying here.

86
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,550
I have to go apologize
for everything Alvin did.

87
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,279
This is so not fair.
Not to us, not to Dave,

88
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,979
and certainly not to the captain,

89
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,149
who I'm sure was really looking forward
to dining with me.

90
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:19,196
Why don't I go speak with Dave?
See if I can smooth things over.

91
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,329
Knock-knock.

92
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,437
- What is it, Simon?
- Well, I would never say this to Alvin.

93
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,235
Goodness knows
he can be totally irresponsible,

94
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,537
but I actually have a suggestion.

95
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,940
You have a suggestion for me?

96
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,844
He's been driving me crazy a lot longer
than he's been driving you crazy.

97
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,678
All right. So what is it?

98
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,844
Imagine Alvin is a spirited racehorse.

99
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,319
That's your advice?

100
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,189
No. I'm not done yet, Dave.

101
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,089
All right, so Alvin is a racehorse...

102
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,493
And you, Dave,
are his incredibly helpful jockey

103
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,328
who's there to guide him
down the racetrack of life.

104
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,231
But if you hold the reins too tight,

105
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,895
that racehorse is going to fight and buck,

106
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,030
which is no fun for anyone.

107
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,937
But if you loosen the
reins just a little...

108
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,142
He'll fly right off the track
and crash into the fence.

109
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,140
I know you want to protect Alvin,

110
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,342
but, Dave, sometimes kids
will rise to the occasion

111
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,282
if you just show them a little trust.

112
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:28,132
All right, guys, room service is on its way.
Lights out by 9:00.

113
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,791
Dave, question.

114
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,860
If we're going to be held captive
in this room...

115
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,370
Because of Alvin!

116
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,666
Can we at least watch a movie?

117
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,207
All right, let's see what's on.

118
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,875
You know what,
why don't you guys pick a movie?

119
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,542
You're old enough
to make your own decision.

120
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,813
For real, Dave?

121
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,944
Absolutely.

122
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,015
- Ooh! Dave looks so elegant.
- Have fun!

123
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:59,461
Wait, Dave, before you go,
I made something for you.

124
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:06,295
Wow, it's really...

125
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,134
it's soft so you can sleep in it

126
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,801
and I made it with all the colors,
so it will go with everything!

127
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,441
Great. I'll put it on after dinner.

128
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,175
You could put it on now, so everyone
at the captain's table could see it.

129
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,776
Nice.

130
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,683
A real chick magnet.

131
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,557
All right, guys, have fun.

132
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,724
But not too much fun,
because I'm still very upset.

133
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,729
Goodbye, Dave.

134
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,898
And, hello, ladies!

135
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,406
I like my tail shaken, not stirred.

136
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,540
- Where are you going?
- To the casino. I'm feeling lucky.

137
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,947
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Dave said...

138
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,280
Dave said, and I quote,

139
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,016
"We're old enough
to make our own decisions."

140
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,920
He meant we were old enough
to choose a film!

141
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,825
Well, we're clearly not.
Check out what Theodore just picked.

142
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,965
What's wrong with this movie?

143
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,933
It's for babies!

144
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:16,474
Which is probably why
Dave treats us like babies.

145
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,543
Munk up, Theodore.

146
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,312
There. That's more like it.

147
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,207
Alvin, please!

148
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,688
I say we go to Salsa Night!

149
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,190
In our pajamas?

150
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,088
Oh, I know!

151
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,766
<i>Party rack is in the house tonight</i>

152
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,235
<i>Everybody just have a good time</i>

153
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,671
<i>And we gonna make you lose your mind</i>

154
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:53,438
<i>We/ust wanna see ya shake that</i>

155
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,288
Alvin!

156
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,134
Alvin! Alvin!

157
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,144
And we have a winner.

158
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,642
Ellie, I love these dresses!

159
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,253
You're so crafty.

160
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,788
Thanks. it's what I do.

161
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,415
- Ow!
- Oh! sorry!

162
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,492
Ew! What are you?

163
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,856
We are the Chipettes.
- Hi, I'm Eleanor!

164
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,661
My sister was just trying to apologize.

165
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,201
What's she sorry for?
Stepping on my friend's foot?

166
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,795
Or her busted, tired little dance moves?

167
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,300
Oh, no, you didn't!

168
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,901
Oh, yes, she did!

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,777
You better get those Lee Press-Ons
out of my face

170
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,680
unless you want to meet my claws.

171
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,813
And, yeah, baby, they're real.

172
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,727
- Do you wanna go?
- Hit it!

173
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,741
<i>Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga</i>

174
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,211
<i>I know you can't control
yourself any longer</i>

175
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,975
<i>Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga</i>

176
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,073
<i>I know you can't control
yourself any longer</i>

177
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,325
<i>Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga</i>

178
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,524
<i>Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga</i>

179
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,334
Oh, whoa!

180
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,598
Ugh!

181
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,909
<i>Let the music move your feet</i>

182
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,450
<i>Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga</i>

183
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,282
<i>I know you can't control
yourself any longer</i>

184
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,219
<i>Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga</i>

185
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,154
<i>I know you can't control
yourself any longer</i>

186
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,884
<i>Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga</i>

187
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,824
<i>I know you can't control
yourself any longer</i>

188
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,760
<i>Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga</i>

189
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,729
<i>I know you can't control
yourself any longer</i>

190
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,798
<i>Come an!</i>

191
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,285
Captain, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

192
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,149
Alvin, he's a kid.
He's just trying to have some fun.

193
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,551
There's nothing wrong with fun.

194
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,682
Our pelican makes sure
that everybody on the ship has fun.

195
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,887
In fact, in port,
he circles the ship on a hang glider.

196
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,155
It's really quite amusing.

197
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,062
However, my number one priority
is the passengers' safety.

198
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:06,001
Sol simply cannot have Alvin put
himself, or anyone else, at risk again.

199
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,765
Believe me, I understand.

200
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,432
If Alvin breaks any more of our rules,
there will be consequences.

201
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,305
The last thing we want
is anyone getting hurt.

202
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,071
Excuse me.

203
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,646
- Hot!
- Sorry.

204
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,876
Hot!

205
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,554
Unbelievable. Gravy pants.

206
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,288
Hey, he?!

207
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,063
- Do you have a problem with me?
- You bet I have a problem with you.

208
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,927
- Why?
- As if you didn't know.

209
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,359
I don't know.

210
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,339
Ian? What are you doing here?

211
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm working, Dave.

212
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,567
This is your job?

213
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,776
Yeah, not too many record labels
are interested in hiring the guy

214
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,612
who blew it with the Chipmunks,
blew it with the Chipettes

215
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,209
and passed on Justin Bieber.

216
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,344
Twice.

217
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:02,620
Look, Ian, I'm sorry you lost your job
and your dignity.

218
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,820
But spilling things, hot things, on me

219
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,693
isn't going to bring any
of that stuff back.

220
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,823
You're right, Dave.
It's too late for me to get my old life back.

221
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,961
But it's not too late to ruin yours.

222
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,505
You want to ruin my life?

223
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,438
Why don't we just start with this vacation?

224
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,908
If I see those chipmunks
break so much as one rule,

225
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,240
I'm going straight to Captain Correlli.

226
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,906
You're in my house now!

227
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,178
Although, technically it's not a house,
it's a ship.

228
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:32,518
The point is, I'll be watching you.

229
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,526
Like a hawk!

230
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,682
- Theodore?
- Please don't eat my brain!

231
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,550
Why are you watching Jungle Monster 4.7

232
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,554
Alvin, how could you...

233
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,556
Alvin?

234
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,354
Simon?

235
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,156
Girls?

236
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,901
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

237
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,633
- I'll be right back!

238
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,638
- it's dark.

239
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,872
You're up for an International Music Award.
That's fantastic!

240
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,879
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

241
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,042
I guess. If you like a lot of adulation.

242
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,588
We fly there right after the cruise.
Hoping to take home Record of the Year.

243
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,284
That would make you
the youngest winner ever.

244
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,757
I'm not that young.

245
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,660
I mean, I'm hanging out in a casino
way past my bedtime.

246
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,960
Not that I have a bedtime!

247
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,796
No one tells me what to do.

248
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,733
Alvin!

249
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,306
Who's Alan, I wonder?

250
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,439
Anyway

251
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:03,173
I'd love to chat more, but I've gotta run.

252
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,248
You're in a lot of trouble, young man!

253
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,617
You can follow me on Critter!

254
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,517
Alvin! Alvin!

255
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,125
Simon?

256
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,285
I wasn't betting. Honest.

257
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,527
Your winnings, sir.

258
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,325
Oh, busted!

259
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,568
I didn't sneak out. I mean, I did.
But only to stop Alvin.

260
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,863
- Right.
- There they are, Captain.

261
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,407
Captain.

262
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,673
What's he going to do,
make us walk the plank?

263
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,306
There's a plank?

264
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,409
No, there's no plank,
but if you guys disobey me one more time,

265
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,748
you will be off the ship.

266
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,653
And you'll miss the International
Music Awards. Do you understand?

267
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,555
- Yes, Dave.
- Uh-huh.

268
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,716
Absolutely.

269
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,960
What if we need to disobey you?

270
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,259
And why would you need to do that?

271
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,562
Well, let's say that you
tell me to stay put.

272
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,434
"Alvin, if you move from that chair,
you're grounded!"

273
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,202
But then I happen to see pirates

274
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,474
climbing up ropes, ever so stealthy,
from the side of the ship.

275
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,377
Now, it would be easy for me

276
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,078
to take my trusty old Swiss Army knife
and cut the ropes.

277
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,747
But I have to stay put. Or do I?

278
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,256
Yes, Alvin, you do.

279
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,950
And what are you doing
with a pocket knife?

280
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:26,062
What pocket knife are you referring to?

281
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,927
Come on, give it to me.
You could cut yourself.

282
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,302
So, I could have saved the whole ship
from robbage and pilgering

283
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,098
and you'd still ground me?

284
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,766
Alvin, there's no such word as robbage.
And it's "pillaging."

285
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,470
But he does have a point, Dave.

286
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,410
There's got to be times when you trust us
to take matters into our own hands.

287
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,507
I trusted you tonight
and look where that got me!

288
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,957
That's probably just the hot gravy talking.

289
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,358
You're all lucky Captain Correlli
has allowed you one more activity.

290
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,127
Is it hang gliding, wakeboarding
or bungee jumping?

291
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,464
No. Shuffleboard.

292
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,731
Man!

293
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,537
By my calculations,

294
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,303
it appears to be 10% shuffle, 90% bored.

295
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,969
That's funny!

296
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,446
Oh, thanks. You really think so?

297
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,984
You know, Dave, I think
I'd prefer the plank.

298
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,111
Sorry, Alvin, but this
is what you get to do.

299
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,681
And I get to do something
I haven't done in a long time.

300
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,719
Absolutely nothing.

301
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,261
Brittany approaches her puck,

302
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:45,467
adjusts her stance,
looks over at me, quite annoyed,

303
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:49,978
wonders to herself
if I'm ever going to shut my mouth,

304
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,572
realizes I'm not, and makes her move.

305
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,380
And... Oh!

306
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,784
Oh, it's short!

307
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,254
A costly error, ladies and gentlemen,

308
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,589
that's going to haunt her
the rest of her career.

309
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,254
You can make all the jokes you want, Alvin,

310
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:11,563
but not even you can make this interesting.

311
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,909
Oh, really? Well,

312
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:22,104
care to make it interesting
that I can make this interesting?

313
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:26,411
Alvin, what are you up to?
Need I remind you Dave is watching us.

314
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,679
Simon, the poor guy hasn't had
a moment's peace since he met us.

315
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,810
He's exhausted.

316
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:35,890
Check this out. In three, two, one.

317
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,119
Lights out.

318
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,253
- Nap time!

319
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:44,062
Time to turn punishment into funishment.

320
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,295
You get it?

321
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:50,067
I took the "pun" in punishment,
and turned it into "fun,"

322
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,437
but kept the "ishment." it's word play!

323
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,477
- Uh-huh.
- What?

324
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,841
Hey, kid!

325
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,646
Wanna make a trade?
That's a nice-looking kite.

326
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,791
Yeah!

327
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,223
I can see Russia from here!

328
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,939
Come on, Simon, grab on.

329
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:29,571
Forget it. All I ever do is try to save him
and it only gets me in trouble!

330
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,251
This won't end well.

331
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,151
Simon, do something!

332
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,382
Oh, seriously?

333
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,618
Simon, help!

334
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:49,327
Alvin's gotten himself in a bind.
Looks like it's Simon saving him again!

335
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,091
Whoa!

336
00:19:56,095 --> 00:20:01,095
Thanks, bro.

337
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,045
- Huh?
- Thank you!

338
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,821
<i>Hack-a-bye, Davey
On the lounge chair</i>

339
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,464
<i>If you awake, you'll
pull out your hair</i>

340
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,466
Whoa! Hey!

341
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,641
- Dave! Dave!
- Ow!

342
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,012
- Dave!
- Help us!

343
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,317
Guys! Guys!

344
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,583
No! No! No, no, no! No! No!

345
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,489
Dave! Help us!

346
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,290
Oh, yeah.

347
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,438
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

348
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,905
You want to go hang gliding,

349
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,977
sign up at the Excursion Desk
like everyone else.

350
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,136
- Ian, you don't understand!
- Oh, I think I do.

351
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,442
Dave Seville is so special
that the rules don't apply to him.

352
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,573
- Let go!
- No, you let go.

353
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,087
Hey! Come on! Great!

354
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:21,814
Oh, my God!

355
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,161
I need my pelican head!

356
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,664
Help!

357
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,028
- Ian!
- You idiot!

358
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,409
Oh, no. No, no.

359
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,744
Great. Way to go, Seville.

360
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,611
- Me?
- You!

361
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,980
Hey!

362
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,482
Save your breath, Dave.
They'll come back for me.

363
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:01,126
In retrospect, this was a bad idea.

364
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,967
We're losing altitude!

365
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,738
I don't think I can make it much longer.

366
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,636
I'm so hungry. Just one bite.

367
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,164
No.

368
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,503
- A nibble?
- No nibbles.

369
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,739
Maybe I can just lick the glaze?

370
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,645
The glaze is what's
keeping you alive, Theodore!

371
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,049
Its high fat content
is creating a waterproof barrier.

372
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,121
I'm gonna starve to death!

373
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,488
Actually, there are many other things
that will kill you before starvation.

374
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,527
Dehydration, sunstroke...

375
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:31,754
An island.

376
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,525
No, an island would probably be helpful.

377
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,123
So if you see one,
you should definitely say something.

378
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,198
Uh, Jeanette?

379
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,270
Oh!

380
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,015
We're alive! We're alive!

381
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,948
Good. Because now

382
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,185
I'm going to kill you!

383
00:22:57,276 --> 00:23:00,348
Guys, guys, guys!
Nobody is killing anyone, okay?

384
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,550
No matter how much he deserves it.

385
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,822
Thank you, Si. Though I could have done
without the passive aggression.

386
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,455
Look,
we've got nothing to worry about.

387
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,931
Dave knows we're gone by now.

388
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,558
He probably has
the whole coast guard looking for us.

389
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:16,629
Meantime, why don't we all just relax
and have some donut?

390
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,114
Did you guys want some?

391
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:36,824
Theodore! Alvin! Simon!

392
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,418
Can't you kick any faster?

393
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,428
It's been two hours, Dave.

394
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,398
Thanks to biannual Pilates classes,
I have legs that won't quit,

395
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,695
but they do slow down.

396
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,600
Take those feet off, let me kick.

397
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:53,036
No quality mascot suit has removable feet.

398
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,340
Take the suit off, then.

399
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,607
- I can't.
- Why not?

400
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,981
I'm not wearing anything underneath.

401
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,020
Look!

402
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,850
No, no, it's okay, I believe you.

403
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,219
No, look!

404
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,121
Look, an island!

405
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,992
Maybe the chipmunks washed up there.

406
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,291
Kick!

407
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,030
Faster! Come on.

408
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,505
Okay, there we go.

409
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:26,202
It won't belong before
a rescue plane sees our SOS

410
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,768
and flies us back to civilization.

411
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,849
I don't hear any planes.

412
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,783
Or helicopters.

413
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,681
Maybe Dave
is coming in a hot-air balloon.

414
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,687
Because those things are really quiet.

415
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,582
I don't think Dave is gonna be
in a hot-air balloon.

416
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,594
But he is coming, right?

417
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,664
Of course he is.

418
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,892
Just maybe not today.

419
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,468
Alvin's right.
We should prepare to stay the night.

420
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,131
What? You guys expect me
to sleep outside?

421
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,765
Last I checked, Brit, we're chipmunks.

422
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,706
We're used to living in the wild.

423
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,780
No, we used to be used
to living in the wild.

424
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,940
Come on, Brit, it's just one night.

425
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,949
One cold night.

426
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:13,113
So we'll make a fire. We're always
setting things on fire accidentally.

427
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,954
How hard can it be
when we put our minds to it?

428
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,994
And how are you intending to do that?

429
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:22,031
I will create a spark by striking this rock
with my Swiss Army knife,

430
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,760
which Dave took from me.

431
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,604
I suppose you have a better idea,
smart guy?

432
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,371
As a matter of fact, I do, smart guy.

433
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:35,769
As you can see, the lens concentrates
the energy of the sun,

434
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,972
thus creating fire!

435
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,746
Whoa. Impressive.

436
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,377
Thanks. Thank you.

437
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,887
Thanks for thinking that.

438
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,456
Hot, hot, hot!

439
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,072
We have made fire!

440
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,938
So, what do we do now?

441
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,549
<i>Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya</i>

442
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:18,087
<i>Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya</i>

443
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:24,051
<i>Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya</i>

444
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:28,291
<i>Oh, lord, Kumbaya</i>

445
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,767
Alvin! Brittany!

446
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,336
We've gotta head inland.

447
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,202
If we climb to the top of that mountain,

448
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,404
we'll be able to get
a better view of the island,

449
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,174
see if they're here.

450
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,340
All right, got it.

451
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,543
What are you doing?

452
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,518
- Building a fire.
- What?

453
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,090
You know, one time in the studio,
Snoop ran out of matches,

454
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,523
got a blaze going
with just two carrot sticks.

455
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,956
Figure, how hard can it be?

456
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,726
Forget the fire. We have to start hiking.

457
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:05,833
Yeah, okay, Dave.
Look, it's getting dark-ish.

458
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,461
It's gonna be cold. I'm gonna build a fire.
We'll go in the morning.

459
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,597
- No, we'll go now.

460
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,698
Don't take that tone of voice
with me, Dave.

461
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,971
I'm not one of your chipmunks
that you can just boss around

462
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,602
and stuff into a cage
whenever you feel like it.

463
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:17,942
That was you, Ian!

464
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,078
Calm down.

465
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,483
Jeez, no wonder those furballs
would rather fly off the ship

466
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,816
than spend another day with you.

467
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,924
They didn't do it on purpose.

468
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,584
It was an accident. They're just kids.

469
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:36,131
I don't know how long
they can survive out there.

470
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,733
And you guys were worried.
 Look at us!

471
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:52,748
We're warm, we got a great fire going,
beautiful night sky

472
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,615
and if a rescue helicopter comes by,
they'll see us!

473
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,620
Everything's gonna be fine.

474
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,950
Good night, guys.

475
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:03,017
- Good night.
- Good night.

476
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,855
Good night.

477
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:06,828
Night.

478
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,355
Theodore!

479
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:13,026
What? Dave always turns off the light
after saying good night.

480
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,037
That fire was sort of the only thing
keeping us from freezing to death.

481
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,698
- Yeah!
- Can't you just relight it?

482
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,471
- How?
- With your glasses. And the sun?

483
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,238
Oh.

484
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,642
I'm <i>a</i> survivor

485
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,551
<i>I'm not gon' give up</i>

486
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:37,889
<i>I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder</i>

487
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:43,057
<i>I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it</i>

488
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,965
<i>I will survive</i>

489
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,833
<i>Keep on survivin'</i>

490
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:52,105
All right!
Way to keep the spirits up, guys.

491
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,699
Doing it, yeah!

492
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:57,302
- And what is this supposed to be?
- Breakfast!

493
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,540
No, it's bark.

494
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,511
Yeah, for breakfast!

495
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,618
I bet it's very good.

496
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,253
it's not.

497
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,729
It's been forever
since our last all-you-can-eat buffet.

498
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,992
Crazy suggestion, guys.

499
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,399
Let's get off this beach
and let's find some real food.

500
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:26,070
If I know my horticulture, and I do,
this is a grove of mango trees.

501
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,543
Then where are all the mangoes?

502
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:32,104
Maybe the Jungle Monster 4 ate them all!

503
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,029
You were planning on sharing that, right?

504
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,429
Of course.

505
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,694
Oh, well, good.

506
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,667
'Cause it kind of looked like
you were gonna eat it all by yourself.

507
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,435
What? I would never do that.

508
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,237
I don't believe you!

509
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,567
Hey!

510
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,418
Yeah! Winning!

511
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,222
What?

512
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,723
<i>Well, I'm just out of school</i>

513
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,190
<i>A sting real, real coal</i>

514
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,726
<i>Gotta dance like a fool</i>

515
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,956
<i>Got the message that
I've gotta be a wild one</i>

516
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,762
I'll make sure to save you the pit!

517
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,003
Oh, my acorns!

518
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,032
Way to go, Theodore!
Come on, we'll split it.

519
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,302
Don't listen to him, Theo.

520
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,139
He's gonna eat it all by himself.

521
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,439
I'll share it with you.

522
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,344
No. She's trying to trick you.

523
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,313
No, you're trying to trick him.

524
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:44,114
No, you're trying to trick him
by saying I'm trying to trick him.

525
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,517
He's lying, Theo!

526
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,282
- What?

527
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,292
<i>Gonna meet all my friends
Gonna have ourselves a ball</i>

528
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:56,388
<i>Gonna tell all my friends
Gonna tell 'em all that I'm a wild one</i>

529
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:59,159
<i>Oh, yeah, I'm a wild one</i>

530
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,565
Theodore, I am so sorry!

531
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,633
<i>Gonna keep 'em moving wild</i>

532
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:06,936
<i>Gotta keep a-s winging, baby
I'm a real wild child</i>

533
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,777
Oh, no!

534
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,658
My precious! My precious!

535
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,464
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Look at us.

536
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,371
One day on this island
and we've become animals!

537
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,975
Did you hear that?

538
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,750
What was that?
- Jungle Monster.

539
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,318
Positions, everybody.

540
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,582
Hold.

541
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,652
Hold.

542
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,286
Fire!

543
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,590
No! Why?

544
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,892
Please don't eat us, Mr. Jungle Monster!

545
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:05,628
I'm not a monster, I'm Zoe.
And I'm clearly a girl

546
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:10,462
who has been on this island for so long

547
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,805
that now she's imagining
that squirrels can talk.

548
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,469
We are chipmunks.

549
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,638
Yeah, Alvin and the Chipmunks.

550
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:20,743
Who and the what now?

551
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,649
I'm sure you've heard of the Chipettes.
We're kind of world famous.

552
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,947
Who?

553
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:26,715
Maybe this will help.

554
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,424
<i>Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah</i>

555
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:33,257
<i>Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la</i>

556
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,354
<i>Want your bad romance</i>

557
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,230
<i>Caught in a bad romance</i>

558
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,829
- Okay. Stop.
- Lame!

559
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,441
I don't know who you are.

560
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,302
Awkward!

561
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,576
Exactly how long have you been here?

562
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,775
Well, I got here on a Monday, so...

563
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,220
Yeah, like, you know, eight or nine years?

564
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,086
Nine years? Wait.
You've been here nine years?

565
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,590
Well, it could be eight.

566
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,683
What if we're here nine years?

567
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,059
What if we're here forever?

568
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,223
I told you, Dave's coming.

569
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,860
I used to think that Dave was coming, too.

570
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,561
And he never did.

571
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,759
Huh?

572
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,637
Dave Henderson, my supervisor at UPS.

573
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,606
I used to fly cargo planes for them,

574
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,737
until one day I crash-landed in the ocean.

575
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,816
- We crash-landed, too.
- Really?

576
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:30,182
But our Dave won't rest until he finds us.

577
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,447
Right, Alvin?

578
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,989
Absolutely.

579
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,254
You mean I'm finally gonna get out of here?

580
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,253
I can't wait to go tell the others!

581
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,425
There are others?

582
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,125
I mean, can you guys imagine
being stuck here for all these years

583
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,825
without anybody to talk to?

584
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,936
I think I'd lose my mind!

585
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,766
Chipmunks,
I'm pleased to introduce my friends.

586
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,969
This is Rawlings, Spalding, Callaway,
Dunlop, and, right there, that's Nerf.

587
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,943
Hey, girlfriend, you look good.

588
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,209
They survived the crash with me.

589
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:00,908
Okay.

590
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:01,984
- Hi.
- Hi.

591
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:03,085
- Hello.
- Okay.

592
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,346
I'm Theodore.

593
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,252
Guys, Dave is coming to get us!

594
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,985
No, not Dave Henderson. I saw your face!

595
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,552
It's another Dave.

596
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:17,259
But, you guys, just get excited.
We're finally gonna get off this island.

597
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,425
She's funny.

598
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,662
In a crazy sort of way.

599
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,365
This totally calls for a party.
Who's hungry?

600
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,667
- Yeah!
- Yes, please!

601
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:25,969
- I'm hungry.
- We are famished.

602
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,270
Yeah? Let's go to my place.

603
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,539
Is it far?
I don't think I could walk another step.

604
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,809
Who said anything about walking?

605
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,969
We're gonna die!

606
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,080
Oh, man! That was so cool!

607
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,242
I know, I know!

608
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,150
Come on. Come on in, guys! Bring it in.

609
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:13,052
Come on down!

610
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,488
Yeah! Wasn't that awesome?

611
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:19,154
No, it was not awesome.
It's a miracle we got here safely.

612
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,821
In fact, the odds of a chipmunk

613
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,661
getting hurt on a zip-line
are one out of six.

614
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,038
Why do I always
have to be right?

615
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,496
Ow! Ow! Ow!

616
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,973
Ellie, Ellie! Are you okay?

617
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,907
I think I sprained my ankle!

618
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,880
Ooh, you know what,
you should put some ice on that.

619
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,718
Oh, no, guys, I don't have any ice.
I live there in that tree.

620
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,916
I thought that maybe you did, though.

621
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,719
No, we don't have any ice.
Just like we don't have any shelter.

622
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,988
Wow, that's a major bummer for you.

623
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,325
- Do you guys like bungee jumping?
- Yes!

624
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,831
No. We do not.

625
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:59,061
Listen, lady, maybe you
should just leave us alone

626
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:01,865
so we can focus more on surviving
and less on killing ourselves.

627
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,340
Whoa, that is a lot of uptight
in a very little package.

628
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:10,709
I'm not uptight. I just don't wanna see
anyone else getting hurt. Ow!

629
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,605
Criminy. What was that?

630
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,046
You know what, that was just a spider

631
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,245
and they live here because this is nature.

632
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,083
It is not just a spider,
it's a Phoneutria bahiensis.

633
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,055
Its bite contains a neurotoxin.

634
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,953
Ooh! Mr. Fancy Words. So what?

635
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:29,089
Alvin, toxin? Poison? Neuro? Brain?

636
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,827
Oh. That's not good.

637
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,904
Side effects include
changes in personality,

638
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,098
loss of inhibition, dry mouth.

639
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,733
Okay, calm down. I get bitten probably
twice a day by these little fellows

640
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,777
and I am still completely normal.

641
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,882
Yes, normal.

642
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,882
Oh, no.

643
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,785
Alvin? Simon!

644
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,888
Chubby one!

645
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,819
Girl chubby one!

646
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,085
Brittany? Jeanette?

647
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,185
I hope they're okay.

648
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,958
Who cares if they're okay?
I just need them to be here.

649
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,994
And here I am thinking you've changed
and don't only care about yourself.

650
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,571
Nope. And it's a good thing, too.

651
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,004
Because right now the rage I'm feeling
for you and those chipmunks

652
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,372
is the only thing keeping me going.

653
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,699
Shall we keep going?

654
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,541
Ian, just keep an eye out for something
to eat or drink, all right?

655
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:19,547
All right. Right there!

656
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,018
- Where?
- That thing around your neck.

657
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,952
You're not gonna eat this.
This was a gift from Theodore.

658
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,683
That explains it.
I was gonna say, it's really ugly.

659
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,522
Like, really... Wow.

660
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,486
- Ugly.
- It's not ugly.

661
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,567
It goes with everything
and it's soft enough to sleep in.

662
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:38,691
Yeah, and it's edible.

663
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,933
You will not eat my son's necklace.

664
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,303
He's not your son, Dave.
He's just a chipmunk.

665
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,342
Oh, Dave. Where are you?

666
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:13,494
Where are you, Alvin?

667
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,661
All right.

668
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,608
I'm gonna crash.

669
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,260
Simon. Where are you going?

670
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,694
Who is this Simon you speak of?

671
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,355
Um. you?

672
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:19,833
No, my name is not Simon. It is

673
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,994
Simone!

674
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,408
That's pretty close to Simon.

675
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:28,171
And yet completely different.

676
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,643
Would you care to join me
on my adventure?

677
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,009
What adventure?

678
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,583
The adventure called life!

679
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,474
Okay.

680
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,915
But just until Dave shows up.

681
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,652
Alvin, Alvin!

682
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,192
Simon and Theodore are gone.

683
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:48,457
They probably just went
to get stuff for the shelter.

684
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,090
It's all the guy can talk about.

685
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,635
Still, it's not like them
to wander off like that.

686
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,261
Could you please go look for them?

687
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,271
Why can't you?

688
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:00,536
I have a situation of my own
to deal with, Alvin.

689
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,178
Oh, right. How is Eleanor doing?

690
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,442
Huh? She's fine. I'm talking about me.

691
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:09,644
It's been two days since my last bath
and I am a mess.

692
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,085
I can't get rescued looking like this.

693
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,280
Oy.

694
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:20,018
Theo! Simon! Simon!

695
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,030
Theodore! Theo!

696
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,693
Si! Theo!

697
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,170
Bonjour, my friend

698
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,874
Simon? Are you bungee jumping?

699
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,534
- His name is not Simon.
- It is Simone.

700
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,935
That's pretty close to Simon.

701
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:40,915
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But he's acting totally different.

702
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,479
The spider bite! That's it!
Remember the side effects?

703
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,989
Personality changes, loss of inhibition?

704
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,217
Lies! Who are you?

705
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:52,123
Wow! Simone is pretty cool.

706
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,288
It's Simon, Theodore. And, no, he's not.

707
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,195
Au revoir, Alfred.

708
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,464
Alvin. it's Alvin!

709
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,802
Whoo! <i>C'est magnifique</i>, Simone!

710
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,874
Okay, Theo, it's all you.

711
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,442
Really? I've never done anything like this.

712
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:08,875
And you never will.

713
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,105
How can you let him do this?
What are you thinking?

714
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,183
I'm thinking, "When did my dad
wash up on this island?"

715
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,114
- What?
- We were having the best time.

716
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,618
Why do you have to show up
and be so uptight?

717
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,847
Me? Uptight?

718
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,356
I'm not the uptight one, I'm the fun one!

719
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,357
The cool one. Ask anybody.

720
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,326
- Who should I ask?

721
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,364
Come on.
Theodore, you can't bungee jump.

722
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,433
You get scared just watching a movie.

723
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,796
Munk up, Alvin.

724
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,010
A little help?

725
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,608
Ah! Much better.

726
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:53,177
Jeanette, these dresses are, like,
totally adorbs. I die.

727
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:57,157
Thank you.
And I also made these for you, Eleanor.

728
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:01,526
Oh, look how handy you are all of a sudden.

729
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:05,829
And in case you get tired,
I made you a wheelchair.

730
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,703
Oh, super.

731
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,432
<i>J'arrive.</i>

732
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,970
<i>Enchanté, mademoiselles.</i> A kiss.

733
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,009
A kiss. And a...

734
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,708
A kiss.

735
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,453
- What's gotten into him?
- Spider venom.

736
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,754
Yeah, yeah, he thinks he's some
sort of fun-loving French dude.

737
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,418
- Really?
- Now he thinks he's...

738
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:35,327
The most interesting munk in the world.

739
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:39,266
Simon? Simon.

740
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,905
- Simone?
- Oui?

741
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,235
I think we should
get to work on that shelter.

742
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,504
Pourquoi? I cannot imagine
a better roof over our heads

743
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,169
than the stars in the sky.

744
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,578
What about the kind of roof
over our head that's actually a roof?

745
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:54,911
It's going to rain!

746
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,349
What is a little rain? Hmm?

747
00:42:57,442 --> 00:43:01,515
We cherish the water, for it is the
water that nurtures the flower.

748
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:03,456
- Okay. This is crazy!

749
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:06,154
Building a shelter was your idea. Yours!

750
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,156
Oh, great. Great!

751
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,529
All right, guys, we're
gonna build a shelter.

752
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:13,466
I need everyone's help. Let's go.

753
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:16,732
I'll try. But I feel so useless.

754
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,336
- What are you doing?
- What I've wanted to do

755
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,844
since the moment I laid my eyes
all over on you.

756
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,875
- What?
- Huh?

757
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,587
Hey, you guys
are going to catch pneumonia

758
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,096
dancing in the rain like that.

759
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,394
<i>I say, hey, I be gone today</i>

760
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,164
<i>But I'll be back around the way</i>

761
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,330
Seems like everywhere <i>I go</i>

762
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:52,999
<i>The more I see the less I know</i>

763
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:57,204
<i>But I know one thing,
that I love you</i>

764
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,303
You ought to be careful
kicking mud around like that.

765
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:00,405
Hello?

766
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,314
Someone could lose an eye!

767
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,288
<i>I've been a lot of places
all around the way</i>

768
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,149
<i>But I don't want to write
a lave sang for the world</i>

769
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,626
<i>No, I just want to write a song</i>

770
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,287
That looks like fun.

771
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,898
<i>Hocking in the dance
hall moving with you</i>

772
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,298
<i>Dancing in the night
in the middle of June</i>

773
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,893
<i>My momma told me don't lose you</i>

774
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,673
<i>I say, hey, I'll be gone today</i>

775
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:29,904
- Eleanor? Would you care to dance?
- I'd love to.

776
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,777
- With me?
 Yes, Theodore!

777
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,909
I can't believe
Jeanette's getting all the attention.

778
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,511
I'm the pretty one.
Jeanette's the smart one.

779
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,183
You don't see me running around
trying to be all smart, do you?

780
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:44,453
I know! I'm the fun one,

781
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:46,119
- You're the pretty one.
- Yeah!

782
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:50,222
Do you know how slippery that dirt is?
This is ridiculous.

783
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,799
Are you even listening to me?

784
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,335
Simon!

785
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:58,405
Alvin? You're starting to sound like Dave.

786
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:02,467
No!

787
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:43,784
Hmm.

788
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,390
What are you doing?

789
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,967
Ugh. Building a shelter.

790
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,093
Since I'm not the fun one any more

791
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:03,798
I figure I may as well be...

792
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,538
the responsible one.

793
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,669
Ew. Really?

794
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:14,079
Well, since I'm not the pretty one any
more, maybe I should build a shelter, too.

795
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:15,981
Yeah, good luck with that.

796
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,643
What, you don't think I could do it?

797
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,881
Hey, I didn't say that, Brit.

798
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,151
I thought it, but I didn't say it.

799
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:27,561
So you wanna play it this way.

800
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:31,495
<i>Alfons-y!</i>

801
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,168
He's so French.

802
00:46:40,565 --> 00:46:42,476
Oh! Be careful, Simone!

803
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,049
Let's do it.

804
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,650
Oh, no.

805
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,038
Now, wasn't that a pleasant ride?

806
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:12,038
Good thing we don't wear pants.

807
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,405
Okay, you guys, come on, come over.

808
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,035
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Of course it's safe.

809
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,114
I do this thing every day.

810
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:26,986
Oh! Oh!

811
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:28,952
- Jeanette!
- Jeanette!

812
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,457
Hold on, Jeanette.

813
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,956
<i>- Viens, ma chére.</i>

814
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,531
No, no. Look into my eyes.

815
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:43,336
You have nothing to fear.

816
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:46,603
Yes, yes. Very good.

817
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:49,605
Voila!You are safe. Bravo!

818
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,304
- You made it!
- You're so brave.

819
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:52,710
Aw!

820
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,677
- Wow.
- Ooh la la!

821
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,687
Pretty.

822
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,054
Whoa.

823
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:12,156
Double rainbow. What does it mean?

824
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:17,772
Alive they're superstars, sure. But dead?
They're legends.

825
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:20,638
I'm talking about tribute albums,
pay-per-view funerals.

826
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,838
Wait a second. You actually think
I'm in this for the money?

827
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:29,847
Well, if you're doing it to pick up chicks,
you're doing a lousy job.

828
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:32,421
I'm doing this because I love them, okay?

829
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,113
Look, if you wanna spend
the rest of your life

830
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,192
running around after a bunch
of spoiled brats, be my guest.

831
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,693
- They're not brats.
- Really? Even Alvin?

832
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,424
You never even bothered
to get to know them, Ian.

833
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,491
I mean, sure, Alvin can be kind of a handful,

834
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,968
but he means well.

835
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:52,563
He's sometimes just
a little irresponsible, that's all.

836
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,886
But, come on, Simon?

837
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:09,287
He's probably the most
level-headed kid I know.

838
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,450
If anything, he's a little too uptight.

839
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,939
And then there's little Theodore.

840
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:32,674
Dave, I barely cared about what you
had to say about the first two.

841
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,012
I can't imagine the big-boned one
is gonna be any more interesting.

842
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,613
Forget it, let's just keep going.

843
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,201
Yee-haw!

844
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,840
<i>UP, poisson, up!</i>

845
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,755
Ooh la la!

846
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,665
Oh, no. This is terrible.

847
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,396
Shouldn't he have come up by now?

848
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,497
Uh-oh. Simone! Where are you?

849
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,576
Zoe, you've gotta do something.

850
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,972
All right.

851
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:39,014
Callaway, I need you to go in there
and find Simone.

852
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:40,673
I know you can do it, little buddy.

853
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,789
You're kidding, right?

854
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,156
If Callaway can't find him, nobody can.

855
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:56,358
Simone!

856
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:57,688
Told you.

857
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,769
I'm sorry if I caused you
any worry, <i>mademaiselle</i>.

858
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:05,670
But I have something for you.
Maybe this will be a way to make it up.

859
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,367
Oh! it's beautiful!

860
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,643
Where did you find it?

861
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,613
Yeah, it is beautiful.
Where did you find it?

862
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,044
In a cave behind the waterfall.

863
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,712
I thought it would look nice on you.

864
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:23,087
But now I realize even the most precious
gem cannot compare to your beauty.

865
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,725
Aw!

866
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:31,892
Yeah. Were there any other jewels
or gems or diamonds

867
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,229
or anything else in there?

868
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:34,962
By the time I found the gold,

869
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,232
I had already been gone
from my Jeanette far too long.

870
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,967
Aw!

871
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:41,372
What?

872
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,941
You guys, they found it. They found it!

873
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,051
And the best part is,
they don't even know what they found.

874
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,982
They think that it's just one bracelet.

875
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,588
Which means that
the rest of the treasure is mine.

876
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,953
All mine!

877
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:03,828
What the...

878
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:11,599
Whoa! What are you?

879
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,470
Hey! Oh!

880
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:16,134
Yeah, you're one of those honey badgers.

881
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,109
You just take what you want.

882
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:20,512
Drop it. Drop it!

883
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,140
You mess with me, ése,

884
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,842
I'll go loco on you.

885
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:27,954
Whoa! Hey!

886
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:31,689
Whoa!

887
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,653
Give it back!

888
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,770
You can sting like a bee
or strike like a cobra,

889
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,363
but this honey munk don't care!

890
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,144
Okay, Brit, I'm all done.

891
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:52,305
If you want, I can help you get started...

892
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:55,043
Whoa!

893
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,781
This tree house is awesome.

894
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:02,084
Maybe you are kind of the smart one.

895
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,317
Thank you, Alvin. And yours is...

896
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:05,949
Well,

897
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,363
you did your best.

898
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:11,661
Anyhoo, no reason we can't be
comfortable and stylish

899
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:14,134
while we wait for Dave to show up, right?

900
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,769
Brit, I...

901
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:20,707
I think I know why Dave hasn't come.

902
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,641
You do? Why?

903
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,974
'Cause he's not even looking.

904
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:29,583
Alvin, why wouldn't he be looking for us?

905
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,711
Because I drive him crazy.

906
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:36,290
You know, the way Simon's
been driving me crazy?

907
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,293
I mean, that's what I've
been doing to Dave.

908
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,192
For years.

909
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:44,559
No wonder he hates me.

910
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:47,725
Oh!

911
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,998
Don't worry, Alvin.

912
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:51,664
I'm sure Dave will come.

913
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:56,006
I mean, he certainly loves
Simon and Theodore.

914
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:59,980
<i>Un, deux, trois</i>

915
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,177
Simon? ls Dave ever gonna find us?

916
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:08,682
Simon? I mean, Simone?

917
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,884
I'm so sorry, were you speaking to moi?

918
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:13,552
Yes! About Dave!

919
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:16,324
Are we ever going to find him?

920
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,261
<i>I see you are sad, man ami.</i>

921
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,530
And I hate to see you sad.

922
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,869
I will help you find your friend Dave.

923
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:28,170
You really think you can find him?

924
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,437
I know I can!

925
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:34,311
And then I will find this Simon
you keep speaking of!

926
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:42,779
As Dave and I have never met,
I will need you to describe him for me.

927
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:47,549
Well, he's very kind and
a good storyteller.

928
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:49,921
Mmm-hmm. Very helpful.

929
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,392
Oh! And he's about this tall.

930
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:54,792
Mmm-hmm.

931
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:58,697
Is he by any chance a big, flightless bird?

932
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,397
I don't think so.

933
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,502
Then these footprints must not be his.

934
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:06,608
Jungle Monster!

935
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,439
Do you hear that?

936
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,914
Yeah, it's my stomach grumbling.

937
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:18,145
No, no, maybe it's a helicopter! Listen!

938
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:28,461
Face it, Dave,
no one is coming to rescue us, okay?

939
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,556
And my stomach noises are gonna get
louder and louder and louder

940
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:34,134
until one day they just stop.

941
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,000
Because I will have eaten you.

942
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,638
Maybe you're right.
Maybe no one's coming.

943
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,645
Maybe the chipmunks aren't here at all.
Maybe they're gone.

944
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:49,509
I really messed up.

945
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:56,349
Dave, it kills me to say
this, kills me, but...

946
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,193
Look, man,

947
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:05,724
you're really good with those kids,
really good.

948
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:06,995
They love you.

949
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:11,300
And I should know because I was really
bad with those kids and they hate me.

950
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,603
But, look, you should know
that whatever happens,

951
00:57:14,698 --> 00:57:16,837
you did nothing wrong. Nothing.

952
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,506
Thanks, Ian.

953
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:23,117
Come here.

954
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:29,357
Yeah. Yeah.

955
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:35,723
Ian?

956
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,031
Ian?

957
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:40,258
Ian!

958
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,427
<i>Mon dieu!</i>

959
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,405
The Jungle Monster's real! And it's angry!

960
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:51,173
Or hungry. Alfons-y!

961
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,043
That means let's go.

962
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,117
Oh.

963
00:57:58,709 --> 00:57:59,915
Ow!

964
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:13,933
Great, a volcano.

965
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:16,903
Of course!
That's why the water was so hot!

966
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:20,168
It's being heated
by the underground magma chamber!

967
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,743
- How do you know that?
- I have no idea!

968
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,147
Maybe I accidentally paid attention.

969
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:30,342
Hey, guys, anyone up for a quick hike?

970
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:32,784
Like, I don't know,
maybe to the waterfall or whatever?

971
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:35,584
Not now, Zoe!
The whole island is going to explode!

972
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:36,680
What?

973
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:41,320
Guys, we've got to get off this island.
We have to build a raft, now.

974
00:58:41,452 --> 00:58:43,159
"Right now" like, right now?

975
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:46,200
Or "right now" like,
after a hike to the waterfall now?

976
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:59,744
I've been hit!

977
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,380
By Dave's necklace?

978
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:06,682
Tell Jeanette I will watch over her
with angel wings.

979
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,124
Dave?

980
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:20,533
Theodore!

981
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:28,505
Dave? Ha ha!

982
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:30,077
Told you we'd find him!

983
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,407
Simon!

984
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:35,415
It is Simone, but I am often confused
for this Simon fellow.

985
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:37,018
Perhaps we look alike?

986
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:40,012
- Simone?
- Ian!

987
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:42,818
Hey, you found the chubby one.

988
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:44,917
Don't worry, Theodore.

989
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:47,359
Nothing's gonna happen to you. Is it?

990
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:54,332
What was that?

991
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,836
That's an active volcano.

992
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:01,903
Okay, Brittany and I will build the deck.

993
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:04,376
Eleanor, you need to start braiding ropes.

994
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:07,711
Jeanette, find as many coconuts
and mangoes as you can.

995
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:07,937
Who knows how long we'll be out there.

996
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,940
Who knows how long we'll be out there.

997
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:11,780
What can I do to help?

998
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,615
- Dave!
- Dave!

999
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,420
Dave!

1000
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:17,547
- You found us!

1001
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:18,625
Hey.

1002
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,285
We missed you so much.

1003
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:21,760
I knew you would find us.

1004
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:23,995
Ow.

1005
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:26,225
Eleanor! What happened?

1006
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:29,634
You know, just a zip-line accident.

1007
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,466
- A what?
- I'm fine.

1008
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:34,439
It only hurts when I try to explain it.

1009
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,566
Okay, you know what, never mind.

1010
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,907
The important thing is you guys are safe.

1011
01:00:58,589 --> 01:01:00,660
Everything's gonna be okay.

1012
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,500
Hey, what is it?

1013
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:07,871
I thought you'd never find us.

1014
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:10,445
That you weren't even looking.

1015
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,644
Why wouldn't I look for you?

1016
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,011
Because I'm such a pain in the...

1017
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,584
Alvin.

1018
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,984
I know, you don't think I'm a pain.

1019
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:24,658
No, you're a pain.
But I'd come, no matter what.

1020
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:37,770
Arc de Triomphe,
mayonnaise, Napoleon.

1021
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,637
I get it, Frenchie,
you come from a rich history.

1022
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,609
Well, guess what, we're all gonna be
history if we don't get out of here.

1023
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,804
Uncle Ian!

1024
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,842
What's he doing here?

1025
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:49,211
It's kind of a long story.

1026
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:50,717
Don't worry, he's cool.

1027
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,980
Yes, for a pelican man.

1028
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,489
Oh, yeah, nothing cooler than
a grown man in a pelican suit.

1029
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,652
So, Dave,
how are we gonna get out of here?

1030
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:04,760
I don't know, Alvin,
I think you've got this under control.

1031
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,635
Theodore,
you and Eleanor are on rope duty.

1032
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,205
Dave and Ian, we need oars.

1033
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:14,241
Simone, you and Jeanette
are in charge of food.

1034
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:16,503
- And, Zoe...
- No, I know, I know.

1035
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,672
I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna pack up my balls!

1036
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,544
Who's that?

1037
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,673
Another long story.

1038
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:29,048
Yeah! Good work, guys!
Let's get off this island.

1039
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,682
This raft won't build itself.

1040
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,096
Whoa!

1041
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,659
Go! Go! Go!

1042
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:44,769
- Heave!
- Ho!

1043
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:47,671
- Heave!
- Ho!

1044
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,847
- Heave!
- Ho!

1045
01:02:59,743 --> 01:03:01,518
It's incredible, you guys.

1046
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,022
Very impressive.

1047
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,753
Just seeing everyone
come together to build it...

1048
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,260
- I just want to say...

1049
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,199
It can wait.

1050
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,770
Wait, where are Jeanette and Simone?

1051
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,433
I hope
this is going to be enough.

1052
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:25,470
Did you hear something?

1053
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:26,979
Who can say?

1054
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:30,448
When I am with you, all I can hear
is the beating of my own heart.

1055
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:32,713
Oh, Simone!

1056
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:37,049
Oh!

1057
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:50,733
Oh, no!

1058
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,101
Oh, no!

1059
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:04,919
Somebody! Help!

1060
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:10,419
Jeanette?

1061
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:14,826
Guys! Guys!
Over here! Come quick, hurry!

1062
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,932
- Simone, are you okay?
- Simone!

1063
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,365
Why are you calling me Simone?

1064
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,766
- Simon?
- Yeah.

1065
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,931
You're back! It finally wore off!

1066
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,474
What wore off?

1067
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:30,773
You were bitten by a spider.
It, like, messed up your brain.

1068
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,642
Ah. Is that why I think I see Dave

1069
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:36,274
and a half-Ian, half-bird?

1070
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,087
No, it's really me. And really Ian.

1071
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,315
'Sup?

1072
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:45,222
Simon, where's Jeanette?
She was out here with you.

1073
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:47,157
Jeanette? I don't know...

1074
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,422
I do.

1075
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:50,361
It's Zoe. She took her.

1076
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,832
Simon, I need to know
where you found that gold bracelet.

1077
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:55,834
What gold bracelet?

1078
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,529
The one you gave to Jeanette.

1079
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,868
What? When did I give Jeanette a bracelet?

1080
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,031
On your date.

1081
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:03,236
Jeanette and I are dating?

1082
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,313
Okay, he's useless.

1083
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:08,212
Theodore, Eleanor,
you're gonna have to lead the way.

1084
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:11,251
I don't remember exactly how to get there.

1085
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:14,386
I do!

1086
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:16,013
Which way, Eleanor?

1087
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:19,150
Make a left. No, right. No, left!

1088
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,126
I thought you said
you knew where you were going.

1089
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:24,722
I do! Sometimes I just forget
my left from my right.

1090
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:26,596
That way!

1091
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:31,237
Okay, we just have to cross here.

1092
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:33,398
Are you kidding me?

1093
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,032
Guys, I can't do that.

1094
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:38,044
But, Simon, you already did.

1095
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:41,481
No, I didn't.
That was Simone, that was not me.

1096
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,949
But Simone is you.
He's in there somewhere.

1097
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:47,885
You just have to find him, taut de suite.

1098
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,957
Because Jeanette needs you, Simon.

1099
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:55,452
No, I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

1100
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,570
All right, Ian, get everyone to the raft.

1101
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:04,639
If the volcano blows
before I make it out of here,

1102
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:05,865
you have to promise me you'll...

1103
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,441
Leave without you. Got it.

1104
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:14,304
Okay.

1105
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,054
Dave.

1106
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,386
I'm coming with you.

1107
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,187
Absolutely not, it's too dangerous.

1108
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:30,493
Remember I said
someday I may need to disobey you?

1109
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:34,430
Sorry, Dave, but I gotta disobey you.

1110
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:37,694
Let's go.

1111
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:54,111
You're not coming up until you have
every last bit of that treasure.

1112
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,516
But the volcano is about to explode!

1113
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:01,822
Well, then I guess you better hurry, huh?

1114
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:04,454
Run, go, go. In you go.

1115
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:08,192
Get down there. That's right.

1116
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:09,667
Keep going!

1117
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,863
<i>S.0.S.</i>

1118
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:15,909
<i>Please someone help me</i>

1119
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:21,813
<i>It's not healthy for me to feel this</i>

1120
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:25,215
<i>Y. O. U. are</i>

1121
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:29,016
<i>Making it hard</i>

1122
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:33,525
<i>I can't help it
See, it don't feel right</i>

1123
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,026
Keep moving!

1124
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,029
<i>This time, please</i>

1125
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:42,398
<i>Someone come and rescue me</i>

1126
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:52,343
Okay! Pull me up. I can't hold any more.

1127
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,644
If you can still talk, it means
you haven't stuffed your cheeks yet!

1128
01:07:57,874 --> 01:08:01,344
Yes! That sounds very good.

1129
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,986
Jeanette!

1130
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,718
Dave!

1131
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,994
They're supposed to be
behind that waterfall!

1132
01:08:11,388 --> 01:08:14,426
That's right.
That's what I'm talking about.

1133
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:19,168
- Zoe!
- No, no. Not another step.

1134
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,173
Don't come any closer.

1135
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,675
Are you all right, Jeanette?

1136
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,912
I'm pretty freaked out,

1137
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,643
and those earrings tasted awful.

1138
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,917
Zoe, you don't have to do this.

1139
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:37,958
Oh, I don't?
I spent 10 years looking for this treasure.

1140
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:41,551
It's the whole reason
why I came to this stinking island!

1141
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:43,722
You mean you didn't crash-land?

1142
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:48,565
They said that I was crazy
and they said that this map was a fake.

1143
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:52,229
And now the treasure is mine!

1144
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,299
Run!

1145
01:08:58,401 --> 01:08:59,937
Jeanette, come on, come on.

1146
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:02,211
Run!

1147
01:09:11,948 --> 01:09:13,586
Jeanette!

1148
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,287
Oh, no!

1149
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:20,094
Help, help!

1150
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:23,829
Oh, no, help!

1151
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,065
You're going back in that cave,

1152
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:29,143
and you are going to get me more treasure.

1153
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,404
Jeanette!

1154
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,511
- Simone!
- It's Simon!

1155
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:05,312
Alvin!

1156
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:14,615
No!

1157
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,892
- Hurry!
- Come on, guys, go!

1158
01:10:21,017 --> 01:10:22,826
<i>Go. go!</i>

1159
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,159
Come on, come on.

1160
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:36,466
Ow!

1161
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:38,879
Look!

1162
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:41,738
Come on!

1163
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:44,910
Run!

1164
01:10:46,309 --> 01:10:47,617
But where's Dave?

1165
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:53,417
- Help me UP!
- Oh, help you UP?

1166
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,995
Is that what I'm supposed to do now, Dave?

1167
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:58,896
All I had was my treasure,
and now it's gone.

1168
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,832
Do you get that? My life is ruined.

1169
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,064
And now you're gonna know
how that feels.

1170
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:06,702
No, no!

1171
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,207
it's tempting to blame Dave.

1172
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,208
I know. I've been there.

1173
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,611
I wish I could get back all those years
I spent plotting my revenge.

1174
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,239
All that time and energy, wasted.

1175
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:18,546
All those pizzas
I had delivered to his house, wasted.

1176
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,642
That was you?

1177
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,756
Not now, Dave! All right?

1178
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:24,053
You could let Dave fall to his death

1179
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:26,127
and I could go back
to the raft with the chipmunks,

1180
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:29,128
become their manager again
and make tons of money.

1181
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:31,459
So, really, I'm good either way.

1182
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:33,967
But let me tell you something.

1183
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:37,469
Hate, anger, regret,

1184
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:40,005
those aren't just members
of a girl group I once signed.

1185
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,076
They're what consumed me.
And they're consuming you.

1186
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:45,476
It's not too late to do the right thing.

1187
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,411
Or not. Again,

1188
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,416
I'm good either way, so...

1189
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,646
I don't want to sway you.

1190
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,586
What are you guys doing? Help me.

1191
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:59,660
Please. Help me save my dad!

1192
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,455
Hurry!

1193
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:02,825
I got you, Dave.

1194
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:05,364
Come on! Help me, guys.

1195
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,702
Wow!

1196
01:12:15,231 --> 01:12:16,676
There they are!

1197
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,211
Come on!

1198
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:19,302
Faster!

1199
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,441
Hurry! Hurry!

1200
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:25,277
Let's go, go. 90!

1201
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,115
Oh, no!

1202
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,190
- Get up!
- Hurry!

1203
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:35,557
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

1204
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:37,130
Run!

1205
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:43,298
Grab the oar!

1206
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:45,895
Come on! Come on, guys!

1207
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:49,806
Paddle!

1208
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:52,745
Come on! Paddle!

1209
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:56,578
Faster! Come on, hurry!

1210
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:10,922
<i>Vacation,
all I ever wanted</i>

1211
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:16,561
<i>Vacation, had to get away</i>

1212
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:22,465
<i>Vacation, meant to be spent alone</i>

1213
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:31,412
Now we'll never get to perform
at the International Music Awards.

1214
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:34,522
I guess now we're the losers.

1215
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:42,790
Jeanette, I don't know what to say.

1216
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:46,924
I guess I was just so obsessed
with finding that treasure

1217
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:49,536
that I kind of... I lost it.

1218
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:51,705
And I'm...

1219
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,865
I'm really sorry.

1220
01:13:54,731 --> 01:13:56,108
We both are.

1221
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:59,139
Well, apology accepted.

1222
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,411
Oh.

1223
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:09,217
Really?

1224
01:14:11,347 --> 01:14:14,226
Look, Dunlop, this is a new beginning

1225
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:16,558
for both of us.

1226
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:23,337
I hope you don't mind.

1227
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:26,496
Simone gave it to me.

1228
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,165
Oh, I don't mind.

1229
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,676
You know, Jeanette,
even the most perfect gem

1230
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:35,010
cannot compare to your beauty.

1231
01:14:41,744 --> 01:14:44,384
- Dave?
- Yes, Alvin?

1232
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,460
I just wanted to say

1233
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:51,123
now that we're not all, you know, dead,

1234
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,824
sorry.

1235
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,866
Sorry.

1236
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:58,295
Sorry I was acting like
a child on the ship.

1237
01:14:58,394 --> 01:15:04,106
And kind of maybe ruined
our family vacation.

1238
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,340
Sometimes a racehorse
needs a little room to run.

1239
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:11,845
Yes. Yeah. I like where your head's at.

1240
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:13,852
That is very wise, David.

1241
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,186
'Sup?

1242
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,586
What, no love for Uncle Ian?

1243
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:24,188
- You put us in cages!
- You put us in cages!

1244
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,231
Seriously? Are we still talking about that?

1245
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,165
New subject, I saved Dave's life.

1246
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:33,035
Okay, but I'll be watching you, mister.

1247
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,839
Alvin, you still have
that pocket knife I gave you?

1248
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:42,007
Knife? Oh, right, sorry,
I meant to give it back.

1249
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,412
I want you to keep it.

1250
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:44,809
Really?

1251
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,115
Maybe you can use it
to signal that helicopter.

1252
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:49,546
What?

1253
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:51,554
- Hey!
- Down here!

1254
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:53,354
Hello!

1255
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,499
It's me, Ian Hawke! Jet Records!

1256
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,427
Guys, circle around!

1257
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,904
<i>Everything's aka y. We got you, guys!</i>

1258
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:19,950
<i>My mama told me
when I was young</i>

1259
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,989
<i>We 're all born superstars</i>

1260
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,152
<i>She rolled my hair and
put my lipstick an</i>

1261
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:31,061
<i>In the glass of her boudoir</i>

1262
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:34,631
<i>"There's nothing wrong
with loving who you are "</i>

1263
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:37,260
<i>She said, “Cause He
made you perfectly</i>

1264
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:43,102
<i>If</i>
- <i>So hold your head up, girl And you 'H go far"</i>

1265
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,736
<i>Listen to me when I say</i>

1266
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:50,442
<i>I'm beautiful in my way
'cause God makes no mistakes</i>

1267
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:54,147
<i>I'm an the right track, baby
I was born this way</i>

1268
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,915
<i>Dan 't hide yourself in regret</i>

1269
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:57,923
<i>Just lave yourself and you're set</i>

1270
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:01,621
<i>I'm an the right track, baby
I was born this way</i>

1271
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:06,662
<i>Ain 't no stopping us now</i>

1272
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,427
<i>We're an the move</i>

1273
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,301
<i>Hay! hm',</i>

1274
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:14,273
