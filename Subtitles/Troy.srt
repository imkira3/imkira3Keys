00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:58,182
greetings from ultrascorp / scOrp
            and
>>>>>> 300MB UNiTED TEAM <<<<<<<

2
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,182
Men are haunted by the vastness
of eternity.

3
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:01,259
And so we ask ourselves...

4
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,227
... will our actions echo
across the centuries?

5
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:10,162
Will strangers hear our names
long after we+IBk-re gone...

6
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:12,496
...and wonder who we were...

7
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:14,832
...how bravely we fought...

8
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:17,902
...how fiercely we loved?

9
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,554
Good day for the crows.

10
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:45,099
I told you yesterday
and I'll tell you again today.

11
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:47,758
Remove your army from my land.

12
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:49,767
I like your land.

13
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:53,466
I think we'll stay. I like your soldiers too.

14
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,836
They fought bravely yesterday.

15
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:58,343
Not well, but bravely.

16
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,070
They won't fight for you.

17
00:05:00,282 --> 00:05:02,273
That's what the Messenians said.

18
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:05,420
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.

19
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:08,613
Now they all fight for me.

20
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:11,315
You can't have the whole world,
Agamemnon.

21
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:13,825
It's too big, even for you.

22
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,656
I don't want to watch another massacre.

23
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:21,936
Let's settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.

24
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,597
And if my man wins?

25
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:28,766
We'll leave Thessaly for good.

26
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,005
I'm a generous man.

27
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,909
If mine wins,
you can keep your throne...

28
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,043
...but Thessaly falls
under my command...

29
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:40,450
...to fight with me whenever I call.

30
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:46,083
Boagrius!

31
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:04,935
This is my man.

32
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:10,115
Achilles!

33
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,095
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.

34
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:24,362
Careful who you insult, old king.

35
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,962
My king, Achilles is not with the army.

36
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,903
-Where is he?
-I sent a boy to look for him.

37
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,172
I was having a good dream.

38
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:17,117
Very good dream.

39
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:21,716
King Agamemnon sent me. He needs to--

40
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,017
I'll speak to your king in the morning.

41
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:27,127
But my lord, it is morning.

42
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,960
They're waiting for you.

43
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:48,011
Are the stories about you true?

44
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:52,615
They say your mother is
an immortal goddess.

45
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:55,914
They say you can't be killed.

46
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,958
I wouldn't be bothering
with the shield then, would I?

47
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:01,459
The Thessalonian you're fighting...

48
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:05,963
...he's the biggest man I've ever seen.
I wouldn't want to fight him.

49
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,898
That's why no one will remember
your name.

50
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:22,014
Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

51
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:25,915
Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

52
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,122
Perhaps we should have our war tomorrow,
when you're better rested.

53
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,826
I should have you whipped
for your impudence!

54
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,763
Perhaps you should fight him.

55
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:47,902
Achilles.

56
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:50,474
Achilles.

57
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:56,048
Look at the men's faces.
You can save hundreds of them.

58
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:00,919
You can end this war
with a swing of your sword.

59
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,585
Think how many songs they'll sing
in your honor.

60
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:08,689
Let them go home to their wives.

61
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:19,166
Imagine a king who fights his own battles.
Wouldn't that be a sight.

62
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,313
Of all the warlords loved by the gods,
I hate him the most.

63
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,778
We need him, my king.

64
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,485
For now.

65
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:28,141
Is there no one else?

66
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:35,377
Is there no one else?

67
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:42,015
Who are you, soldier?

68
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:45,959
Achilles. Son of Peleus.

69
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,226
Achilles?

70
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:50,794
I'll remember the name.

71
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,367
The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter.

72
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:58,469
Give it to your king.

73
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,599
He's not my king.

74
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:23,254
-Brothers in arms!
-Brothers in arms!

75
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,626
-Friendship!
-Friendship!

76
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:36,607
Princes of Troy,
on our last night together...

77
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:39,243
...Queen Helen and I salute you.

78
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,348
We've had our conflicts before, it's true.

79
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:48,250
We fought many battles, Sparta and Troy.
And fought well!

80
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,892
But I have always respected your father.

81
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:55,621
Priam is a good king, a good man.

82
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:59,824
I respected him as an adversary.
I respect him now as my ally.

83
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,799
Hector, Paris, young princes, come.
Stand.

84
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:05,670
Drink with me.

85
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:09,640
Let us drink to peace.

86
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:14,039
To peace between Troy and Sparta.

87
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,543
May the gods keep the wolves in the hills
and the women in our beds.

88
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:46,043
-For the gods.
-For the gods.

89
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:50,680
Strong arm.
Thank the gods we made peace.

90
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:54,379
I've seen too many of my men struck down
with this arm.

91
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:55,682
Never again, I hope.

92
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:59,759
Only one man wields a sword
better than you.

93
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:00,917
Achilles.

94
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,255
That madman.

95
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:07,333
He would hurl a spear at Zeus himself.
If the god insulted him.

96
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:14,173
See that one over there?
I picked her special for you.

97
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:17,706
She's a little lioness.

98
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,811
Thank you.
My wife waits for me in Troy.

99
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:26,512
My wife waits for me right there.

100
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:27,985
Wives are for breeding.

101
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:31,956
You understand, for making little princes.
Come enjoy yourself tonight.

102
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:36,423
You make excellent wine in Sparta.

103
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:28,611
You shouldn't be here.

104
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,220
That's what you said last night.

105
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:38,318
Last night was a mistake.

106
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,562
And the night before?

107
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:46,122
I've made many mistakes this week.

108
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:04,013
Do you want me to go?

109
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:09,551
Yes.

110
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:22,233
Where should I go?

111
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,163
Away.

112
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:28,603
Far away.

113
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:27,030
I have something for you.

114
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:36,475
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.

115
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:49,417
They're beautiful.

116
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,090
But I can't wear them.

117
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:56,426
Menelaus would kill us both.

118
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,364
Don't be afraid of him.

119
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,597
I'm not afraid of dying.

120
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm afraid of tomorrow.

121
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:16,042
I'm afraid of watching you sail away
and knowing you'll never come back.

122
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:24,816
Before you came to Sparta, I was a ghost.

123
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:29,590
I walked, and I ate,
and I swam in the sea...

124
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:32,859
...but I was just a ghost.

125
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,030
You don't have to fear tomorrow.

126
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:41,337
Come with me.

127
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,011
Don't play with me. Don't play.

128
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:56,447
If you come, we'll never be safe.

129
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:00,490
Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us.

130
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:02,958
But I'll love you.

131
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,224
Till the day they burn my body...

132
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:10,103
...I will love you.

133
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:36,186
Tecton.

134
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:40,795
Make the proper offerings to Poseidon
before we sail.

135
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:43,095
We don't need any more widows in Troy.

136
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:45,538
Goat or pig?

137
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:48,974
Which does the sea god prefer?

138
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:52,409
I'll wake the priest and ask him.

139
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,008
Paris.

140
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:05,486
We should get to bed.
We won't sleep on land again for weeks.

141
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,254
I have no trouble sleeping on the seas,
brother.

142
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:10,420
Athena sings lullabies to me.

143
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,632
And who sang lullabies to you tonight?

144
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:16,602
Tonight?

145
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:21,306
Tonight was the fisherman's wife.

146
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:23,633
A lovely creature.

147
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,247
I hope you didn't let the fisherman
catch you.

148
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:30,608
He was more concerned with the fish.

149
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:32,943
You do understand why we're in Sparta.

150
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,382
For peace.

151
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:38,889
And you understand that Menelaus,
the king of Sparta, is a very powerful man.

152
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,585
And that his brother, Agamemnon,
the king of Mycenae...

153
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,787
...commands all the Greek forces.

154
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,434
What does this have to do
with the fisherman's wife?

155
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:49,035
Paris...

156
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:51,467
...you're my brother and I love you.

157
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:54,130
But if you do anything
to endanger Troy...

158
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:58,039
...I will rip your pretty face
from your pretty skull.

159
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,813
Now get some sleep.

160
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:07,350
We sail in the morning.

161
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:35,310
A beautiful morning.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.

162
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:39,683
Sometimes the gods bless you in the
morning and curse you in the afternoon.

163
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:42,823
Drop sail!

164
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:45,916
Do you love me, brother?

165
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:49,588
Would you protect me
against any enemy?

166
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:54,796
The last time you spoke to me like this...

167
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:58,302
...you were 10 years old,
and you'd just stolen Father's horse.

168
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,668
What have you done now?

169
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:04,042
I must show you something.

170
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:39,540
-Where is she?
-Who, my king?

171
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,249
I swear by the father of the gods,
I will gut you here if you don't tell me!

172
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:47,583
My king!

173
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:49,822
She left.

174
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:51,653
With the Trojans.

175
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:59,499
The fisherman here saw her
board their ship.

176
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,001
The Trojans?

177
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:04,463
With the young prince, Paris. She....

178
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:13,406
Get my ship ready.

179
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:17,009
Turn us round. Back to Sparta.

180
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,446
High on the sail!

181
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:20,177
-Wait, wait.
-You fool!

182
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:22,686
-Listen to me.
-Do you know what you've done?

183
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:26,358
Do you know how many years our father
worked for peace?

184
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:28,761
I love her.

185
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,860
It's all a game to you, isn't it?

186
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:35,833
You roam from town to town, bedding
merchants' wives and temple mates.

187
00:22:36,003 --> 00:22:37,994
You think you know
something about love.

188
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,571
What about your father's love? You spat on
him when you brought her on this ship!

189
00:22:42,743 --> 00:22:46,645
What about the love for your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman?

190
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:52,581
I won't let you start a war for her.

191
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:54,243
May I speak?

192
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:59,484
What you're saying is true. I've wronged
you. I've wronged our father.

193
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,720
If you want to take Helen
back to Sparta, so be it.

194
00:23:03,531 --> 00:23:05,260
But I go with her.

195
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,661
To Sparta? They'll kill you.

196
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:10,167
Then I'll die fighting.

197
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:13,931
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you,
doesn't it? To die fighting.

198
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:17,100
-Little brother, have you ever killed a man?
-No.

199
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:19,303
-Ever seen a man die in combat?
-No.

200
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:23,745
I've killed men, and I've heard them dying.
And I've watched them dying.

201
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:26,716
And there's nothing glorious about it.
Nothing poetic.

202
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:30,152
You say you want to die for love.
You know nothing about dying.

203
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:32,518
And you know nothing about love!

204
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:35,594
All the same, I go with her.

205
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:37,962
I won't ask you to fight my war.

206
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:42,997
You already have.

207
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,506
To Troy!

208
00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:49,700
About ship! Set sail!

209
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:25,512
-I want her back.
-Well, of course you do.

210
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,203
She's a beautiful woman.

211
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:30,975
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands.

212
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,511
I won't rest till I've burned Troy
to the ground.

213
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:36,747
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.

214
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,815
I should have listened to you.

215
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:41,257
Peace is for the women...

216
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:43,662
...and the weak.

217
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:48,124
Empires are forged by war.

218
00:24:49,803 --> 00:24:53,603
All my life, I've stood by your side,
fought your enemies.

219
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:57,800
You're the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.

220
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,615
But have I ever complained?
Have I ever asked you for anything?

221
00:25:01,782 --> 00:25:04,546
Never. You're a man of honor.

222
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:07,418
Everyone in Greece knows this.

223
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:10,447
The Trojans spat on my honor.

224
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:14,590
An insult to me is an insult to you.

225
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:19,161
And an insult to me
is an insult to all Greeks.

226
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:22,536
Will you go to war with me, brother?

227
00:25:34,982 --> 00:25:38,145
I always thought my brother's wife
was a foolish woman...

228
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,811
...but she's proved to be very useful.

229
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:47,082
Nothing unifies a people
like a common enemy.

230
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:49,422
The Trojans have never been conquered.

231
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,723
Some say they can't be conquered.

232
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,534
Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable
behind his high walls.

233
00:25:58,072 --> 00:26:01,007
He thinks the sun god will protect him.

234
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,802
But the gods protect only...

235
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:06,542
...the strong!

236
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:09,544
If Troy falls...

237
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,978
...I control the Aegean.

238
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:15,815
Hector commands the finest army
in the east.

239
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,187
And Troy is built to withstand
a 10-year siege.

240
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,726
There won't be a 10-year siege.

241
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:25,331
I'll attack them with the greatest force
the world has ever seen.

242
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,796
I want all the kings of Greece
and their armies.

243
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,869
Send emissaries in the morning.

244
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:32,300
One last thing.

245
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:35,806
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.

246
00:26:37,945 --> 00:26:39,435
Achilles.

247
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:46,081
He can't be controlled.
He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans.

248
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:49,689
We don't need to control him,
we need to unleash him.

249
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:52,858
That man was born to end lives.

250
00:26:53,027 --> 00:26:57,430
Yes, he's a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I've built.

251
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:02,067
Before me, Greece was nothing. I brought
all the Greek kingdoms together.

252
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:06,104
I created a nation out of fire worshipers
and snake eaters!

253
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:09,037
I build the future, Nestor. Me!

254
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:13,272
Achilles is the past.

255
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:17,781
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.

256
00:27:17,985 --> 00:27:21,512
How many battles have we won
off the edge of his sword?

257
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:24,920
This will be the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

258
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:27,526
We need the greatest warrior.

259
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:34,957
There's only one man he'll listen to.

260
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:37,634
I'll send a ship in the morning.

261
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,710
Greetings, brother.

262
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:54,752
We were told
King Odysseus is hid in the hills.

263
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:57,151
Odysseus?

264
00:27:59,426 --> 00:28:03,055
That old bastard drinks my wine
and never pays.

265
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:06,960
You ought to respect your king, friend.

266
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:08,795
Respect him?

267
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:11,199
I'd like to punch him in the face.

268
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:14,307
He's always pawing at my wife,
trying to tear her clothes off.

269
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:25,049
I hope Agamemnon's generals
are smarter than his emissaries.

270
00:28:30,457 --> 00:28:31,890
What did you say?

271
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:37,592
You want me
to help you fight the Trojans.

272
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:45,595
You're....

273
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,074
Are you...?

274
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:55,176
Forgive us, King Odysseus.

275
00:28:59,286 --> 00:29:00,685
Well....

276
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:03,118
I'm gonna miss my dog.

277
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:06,818
King Agamemnon has a favor
to ask of you.

278
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:10,696
Of course he does.

279
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:38,150
Never hesitate.

280
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:56,873
Fancy swordplay.

281
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:02,311
Nervous?

282
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:06,709
Petrified.

283
00:30:08,155 --> 00:30:10,885
You told me never
to change sword hands.

284
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:15,918
Yes. When you know how to use it,
you won't be taking my orders.

285
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:38,315
Your reputation for hospitality
is fast becoming legend.

286
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:46,617
Patroclus, my cousin.

287
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:49,860
Odysseus, king of Ithaca.

288
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,993
Patroclus.

289
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:55,461
I knew your parents well.

290
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:57,263
I miss them.

291
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,666
Now you have this one
watching over you, eh?

292
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:05,073
Learning from Achilles himself.

293
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:08,081
Kings would kill for the honor.

294
00:31:08,282 --> 00:31:10,876
Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding?

295
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,685
We need to talk.

296
00:31:18,725 --> 00:31:20,716
I will not fight for him.

297
00:31:21,094 --> 00:31:23,824
I'm not asking you to fight for him.

298
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:26,090
I'm asking you to fight for Greece.

299
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,527
Have the Greeks tired of fighting
each other?

300
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:31,564
-For now.
-For the Greeks!

301
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,868
The Trojans never harmed me.

302
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:37,135
They insulted Greece.

303
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:41,145
They insulted a man who couldn't hold
on to his wife. Is that my business?

304
00:31:41,315 --> 00:31:43,943
Your business is war, my friend.

305
00:31:44,117 --> 00:31:47,314
Is it? Am I the whore of the battlefield?

306
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:49,989
The man has no honor.

307
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:52,821
I won't be remembered
as a tyrant's mercenary.

308
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:56,554
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.

309
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,995
And let the gods decide
which man to glorify.

310
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,235
Forget Agamemnon.

311
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,960
Fight for me.

312
00:32:05,372 --> 00:32:08,808
My wife will feel much better
if she knows you're by my side.

313
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:11,035
I'll feel much better.

314
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:14,340
Is Ajax going to fight in Troy?

315
00:32:14,514 --> 00:32:18,348
They say he can fell an oak tree
with one swing of the ax.

316
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,151
Trees don't swing back.

317
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,850
We're sending the largest fleet
that ever sailed.

318
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:31,192
A thousand ships.

319
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:33,924
A thousand ships?

320
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:37,062
Prince Hector. Is he as good a warrior
as they say?

321
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:40,463
The best of all the Trojans.

322
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:43,872
Some say he's better
than all the Greeks too.

323
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:47,536
Even if your cousin doesn't come...

324
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:51,275
...I hope you'll join us.
We could use a strong arm like yours.

325
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,719
Play your tricks on me,
but not my cousin.

326
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:58,785
You have your swords. I have my tricks.

327
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:01,318
We play with the toys the gods give us.

328
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,961
We sail for Troy in three days.

329
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:12,328
This war will never be forgotten.

330
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:16,575
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.

331
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:45,093
They say the king of Ithaca
has a silver tongue.

332
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:48,538
I knew they would come for you.

333
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:51,075
Long before you were born...

334
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:53,371
...I knew they would come.

335
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:00,743
They want you to fight in Troy.

336
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:10,854
I'm making you
another seashell necklace.

337
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:14,133
Like the ones I made you
when you were a boy.

338
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:15,859
Do you remember?

339
00:34:23,276 --> 00:34:24,709
Mother...

340
00:34:26,546 --> 00:34:28,480
...tonight, I decide.

341
00:34:33,553 --> 00:34:36,078
If you stay in LÃ¡risa...

342
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,517
...you will find peace.

343
00:34:38,692 --> 00:34:40,489
You will find a wonderful woman.

344
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,391
You will have sons and daughters,
and they will have children.

345
00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:46,555
And they will love you.

346
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:49,997
When you are gone,
they will remember you.

347
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,233
But when your children are dead
and their children after them...

348
00:34:58,278 --> 00:35:00,371
...your name will be lost.

349
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:05,549
If you go to Troy...

350
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:09,314
...glory will be yours.

351
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,018
They will write stories about your
victories for thousands of years.

352
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,224
The world will remember your name.

353
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:23,730
But if you go to Troy...

354
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:28,672
...you will never come home.

355
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,778
For your glory walks hand in hand
with your doom.

356
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:38,448
And I shall never see you again.

357
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:44,520
You know this to be true, Mother?

358
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:47,349
I know this.

359
00:38:05,098 --> 00:38:07,532
-My son.
-Father.

360
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,867
Paris.

361
00:38:21,715 --> 00:38:22,977
Father.

362
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:27,252
-This is Helen.
-Helen?

363
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:29,780
Helen of Sparta?

364
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:33,624
Helen of Troy.

365
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,328
I've heard rumors of your beauty.

366
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:46,499
For once...

367
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,908
...the gossips were right.

368
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:53,543
Welcome.

369
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:56,478
Thank you, good king.

370
00:38:56,649 --> 00:38:59,049
Come, you must be tired.

371
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:13,426
Look.

372
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:17,032
He's grown.

373
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:19,437
He is strong.

374
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,766
He's just like his father.

375
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:25,639
-Paris!
-Briseis!

376
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:32,812
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows
with each new moon.

377
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:35,749
Briseis.

378
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:39,624
A servant of Apollo now.

379
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:44,230
The young men of Troy were devastated
when Briseis chose the virgin robes.

380
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:45,489
Uncle.

381
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:52,633
I thank the gods for your safe return.

382
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:57,910
-For the gods.
-For the gods.

383
00:39:58,078 --> 00:39:59,807
For gods.

384
00:40:14,894 --> 00:40:16,384
Father...

385
00:40:16,563 --> 00:40:19,054
...I know this is the last thing we need.

386
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:23,760
It is the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.

387
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,830
-But I'm surprised you let him bring her.
-If I'd let him fight Menelaus for her...

388
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:31,875
...you'd be burning a son's body,
not welcoming a daughter.

389
00:40:32,045 --> 00:40:34,809
We could send peace envoys
to Menelaus.

390
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:38,109
You know Menelaus.
He'd spear their heads to his gate.

391
00:40:38,284 --> 00:40:40,684
What would you have me do?

392
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:44,656
Put her on a ship and send her home.

393
00:40:47,794 --> 00:40:50,820
Women have always loved Paris,
and he has loved them back.

394
00:40:50,997 --> 00:40:52,897
But this is different.

395
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:55,398
Something has changed in him.

396
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:59,368
If we send her home to Menelaus,
he will follow her.

397
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:03,241
This is my country,
and these are my countrymen.

398
00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:06,901
I don't want to see them suffer
so my brother can have his prize.

399
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,010
It's not just the Spartans
coming after her.

400
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:12,480
By now, Menelaus has gone
to Agamemnon.

401
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:15,485
And Agamemnon has wanted
to destroy us for years.

402
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:18,021
Once we're out of the way,
he controls the seas.

403
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:23,189
Enemies have been attacking us
for centuries. Our walls still stand.

404
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,831
Father, we can't win this war.

405
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,032
Apollo watches over us.

406
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,735
Even Agamemnon is no match
for the gods.

407
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:36,637
And how many battalions
does the sun god command?

408
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:38,401
Do not mock the gods.

409
00:41:42,315 --> 00:41:45,842
When you were very young,
you came down with scarlet fever.

410
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:49,113
Your little hand was so hot.

411
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:52,554
The healer said
you would not last the night.

412
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:58,662
I went down to Apollo's temple
and I prayed until the sun came up.

413
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:03,130
That walk back to the palace
was the longest of my life.

414
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:07,706
But I went into your mother's room
and you were sleeping in her arms.

415
00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:09,603
The fever had broken.

416
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:14,343
I promised that day
to dedicate my life to the gods.

417
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:16,539
I will not break my promise.

418
00:42:16,716 --> 00:42:21,449
For 30 years I have worked for peace.
Thirty years.

419
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:24,915
Paris is a fool sometimes, I know that.

420
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:29,858
But I will fight a thousand wars
before letting him die.

421
00:42:30,763 --> 00:42:34,859
Forgive me, Father,
but you won't be the one fighting.

422
00:42:54,754 --> 00:42:56,517
They're coming for me.

423
00:42:57,557 --> 00:42:59,388
The wind is bringing them closer.

424
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:01,220
What if we left?

425
00:43:01,394 --> 00:43:04,261
Tonight. Right now.

426
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,196
What if we went down to the stables,
took two horses and left?

427
00:43:08,434 --> 00:43:10,868
Ride east, keep riding.

428
00:43:11,037 --> 00:43:13,733
-And go where?
-Away from here.

429
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,676
I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us.

430
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,114
But this is your home.

431
00:43:23,816 --> 00:43:26,216
You left your home for me.

432
00:43:30,123 --> 00:43:32,353
Sparta was never my home.

433
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:36,292
My parents sent my there when I was 1 6
to marry Menelaus.

434
00:43:36,462 --> 00:43:37,895
But it was never my home.

435
00:43:38,064 --> 00:43:39,998
We'll live off the land.

436
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:44,102
No more palaces for us. No more servants.
We don't need any of that.

437
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,703
And your family?

438
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:49,706
We'd be protecting my family. If we're
not here, what's the need for war?

439
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:53,675
Menelaus won't give up.
He'll track us to the end of the world.

440
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,748
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.

441
00:43:57,917 --> 00:43:59,782
You don't know Menelaus.

442
00:43:59,952 --> 00:44:02,079
You don't know his brother.

443
00:44:02,655 --> 00:44:06,147
They'll burn every house in Troy
to find us.

444
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:09,884
They'll never believe we've left.

445
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:13,794
And even if they do,
they'll burn it for spite.

446
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:19,561
Then I'll make it easy for him to find me.

447
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:24,869
I'll walk right up to him
and tell him you're mine.

448
00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:36,779
You're very young, my love.

449
00:44:39,392 --> 00:44:41,257
We're the same age.

450
00:44:43,596 --> 00:44:46,224
You're younger than I ever was.

451
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:28,910
Take up your positions!

452
00:48:53,112 --> 00:48:56,240
Black sail. It's Achilles.

453
00:48:56,415 --> 00:48:57,848
What's the fool doing?

454
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:01,947
He's going to take the beach of Troy
with 50 men?

455
00:49:05,224 --> 00:49:07,886
Row, Myrmidon, row!

456
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,461
My lord?

457
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:16,124
Should we wait for the others?

458
00:49:17,303 --> 00:49:20,295
-They brought us here for war.
-Yes, but Agamemnon's orders--

459
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:22,964
You fight for me, Eudorus,
or Agamemnon?

460
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:24,439
For you, my lord.

461
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:29,047
Then fight for me. And let the servants
of Agamemnon fight for him.

462
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,717
Make way there! Make way!

463
00:49:50,503 --> 00:49:53,870
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?

464
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,271
-Waiting at the city gates.
-Good. I'll be right there.

465
00:49:58,144 --> 00:50:00,908
Lysander, how long
before the army is ready?

466
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,208
Half of our men are still coming.
We have to arm them--

467
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:05,873
-How long?
-Noon.

468
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:07,713
Make it sooner.

469
00:50:07,887 --> 00:50:11,084
And Lysander, I want patrols
to scour the countryside.

470
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:12,986
I want every home
and pasture checked...

471
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:15,286
...every Trojan to be
brought inside the city walls.

472
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:17,395
If they can't walk, carry them.

473
00:50:32,311 --> 00:50:34,040
Patroclus!

474
00:50:37,016 --> 00:50:38,574
Put down your spear.

475
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:40,810
-I'm fighting the Trojans.
-Not today.

476
00:50:40,986 --> 00:50:42,920
I'm ready. You taught me how to fight.

477
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:46,957
And you're a good student.
But you're not a Myrmidon yet.

478
00:50:48,894 --> 00:50:50,361
Look at these men.

479
00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:54,829
They are the fiercest soldiers in all
of Greece. Each of them has bled for me.

480
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,991
-Guard the ship.
-But this is a war.

481
00:50:57,169 --> 00:51:01,469
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans if I'm
concerned for you. Guard the ship.

482
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:24,390
Trojans!

483
00:51:27,233 --> 00:51:30,168
All my life, I've lived by a code.

484
00:51:30,669 --> 00:51:32,694
And the code is simple:

485
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:36,433
Honor the gods, love your woman...

486
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:37,803
...and defend your country.

487
00:51:40,246 --> 00:51:42,180
Troy is mother to us all.

488
00:51:42,815 --> 00:51:44,043
Fight for her!

489
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:04,627
Myrmidons...

490
00:52:06,338 --> 00:52:08,067
...my brothers of the sword.

491
00:52:09,508 --> 00:52:12,909
I'd rather fight beside you
than any army of thousands.

492
00:52:13,078 --> 00:52:16,445
Let no man forget how menacing we are.
We are lions!

493
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:25,153
Do you know what's there, waiting,
beyond that beach?

494
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:28,487
Immortality! Take it! It's yours!

495
00:52:41,473 --> 00:52:42,940
Fight positions!

496
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:45,008
Archers!

497
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:47,640
Archers, draw!

498
00:52:49,582 --> 00:52:50,981
Draw!

499
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,295
Keep forward!

500
00:53:28,654 --> 00:53:30,246
Form up!

501
00:53:30,756 --> 00:53:32,280
Formation!

502
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:35,119
The man wants to die.

503
00:53:55,547 --> 00:53:57,014
On my command!

504
00:54:04,857 --> 00:54:06,688
Break off! Break off!

505
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,510
Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

506
00:54:34,687 --> 00:54:36,382
Achilles! Achilles!

507
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:42,118
Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

508
00:54:42,294 --> 00:54:45,388
Give him the battle,
we'll take the war.

509
00:54:45,564 --> 00:54:49,728
Give him too many battles and
the men will forget who's king.

510
00:55:03,415 --> 00:55:06,350
Ajax, you need to see this.

511
00:55:08,187 --> 00:55:09,654
Look at him...

512
00:55:09,822 --> 00:55:12,518
...hogging all the glory.

513
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:16,685
Row, you lazy whores, row!

514
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:19,762
Greeks are dying! Row!

515
00:55:48,794 --> 00:55:51,991
Those men down there need help. Now!
Tecton, with me.

516
00:56:04,676 --> 00:56:08,009
I am Ajax, breaker of stones!

517
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,081
Look upon me and despair!

518
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,141
Flank! To the flank!

519
00:57:05,704 --> 00:57:06,966
No!

520
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:39,160
Achilles! Achilles!

521
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:47,606
Back to the city! Back to the city!

522
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:06,691
The sun god is a patron of Troy,
our enemy.

523
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,562
Take whatever treasure you can find.

524
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:19,504
With your permission, my lord.

525
00:58:24,483 --> 00:58:27,418
-Speak.
-Apollo sees everything.

526
00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:30,384
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.

527
00:58:54,046 --> 00:58:55,445
Warn the men.

528
00:58:56,615 --> 00:58:58,242
Wait.

529
01:00:49,778 --> 01:00:53,942
You are very brave or very stupid
to come after me alone.

530
01:00:55,817 --> 01:00:57,444
You must be Hector.

531
01:01:05,693 --> 01:01:07,661
Do you know who I am?

532
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:12,623
These priests weren't armed.

533
01:01:14,669 --> 01:01:19,038
Yes. There's no honor
in cutting old men's throats.

534
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:22,942
Only children and fools fight for honor.

535
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:24,942
I fight for my country.

536
01:01:26,848 --> 01:01:28,543
Fight me!

537
01:01:34,956 --> 01:01:37,481
Why kill you now, prince of Troy...

538
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:39,627
...with no one here to see you fall?

539
01:01:52,373 --> 01:01:53,965
Why did you come here?

540
01:01:54,476 --> 01:01:57,001
They'll be talking about this war
for 1000 years.

541
01:01:58,146 --> 01:02:01,411
In 1000 years, the dust
from our bones will be gone.

542
01:02:01,683 --> 01:02:04,948
Yes, prince. But our names will remain.

543
01:02:15,597 --> 01:02:19,590
Go home, prince. Drink some wine,
make love to your wife.

544
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:21,797
Tomorrow, we'll have our war.

545
01:02:25,106 --> 01:02:27,472
You speak of war as if it's a game.

546
01:02:27,642 --> 01:02:31,442
How many wives wait at Troy's gates
for husbands they'll never see again?

547
01:02:31,913 --> 01:02:36,680
Your brother can comfort them. I hear
he's good at charming other men's wives.

548
01:02:51,766 --> 01:02:53,427
My lord, you let him go?

549
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:59,369
It's too early in the day for killing princes.

550
01:03:30,939 --> 01:03:34,067
Achilles! Achilles!

551
01:03:34,242 --> 01:03:40,181
Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

552
01:04:14,515 --> 01:04:16,983
-Achilles.
-Ajax.

553
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:22,048
You're as fearless as the gods.
I'm honored to go to war with you.

554
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:23,622
As am I.

555
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:26,893
If you sailed slower,
the war would be over.

556
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:29,689
I'll miss the start as long as I'm here
at the end.

557
01:04:29,864 --> 01:04:31,855
My lord?

558
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:34,228
I've got something to show you.

559
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,580
The men found her hiding in the temple.

560
01:04:56,257 --> 01:04:57,656
They thought she'd...

561
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,321
...amuse you.

562
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:13,073
What's your name?

563
01:05:17,378 --> 01:05:19,073
Did you not hear me?

564
01:05:20,515 --> 01:05:22,449
You killed Apollo's priests.

565
01:05:22,617 --> 01:05:24,778
I've killed men in five countries,
never a priest.

566
01:05:24,952 --> 01:05:27,011
Then your men did.

567
01:05:27,455 --> 01:05:29,423
The sun god will have his vengeance.

568
01:05:30,091 --> 01:05:31,922
What's he waiting for?

569
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:34,288
The right time to strike.

570
01:05:36,864 --> 01:05:39,924
His priests are dead,
and his acolyte's a captive.

571
01:05:41,135 --> 01:05:44,627
-I think your god is afraid of me.
-Afraid?

572
01:05:45,073 --> 01:05:48,099
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.

573
01:05:48,276 --> 01:05:51,074
-Where is he?
-You're nothing but a killer!

574
01:05:51,245 --> 01:05:54,009
You wouldn't know anything
about the gods.

575
01:05:56,784 --> 01:05:59,844
I know more about the gods
than your priests.

576
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,011
I've seen them.

577
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,292
You're royalty, aren't you?

578
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:15,433
Spent years talking down to men.

579
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:21,268
You must be royalty.

580
01:06:23,544 --> 01:06:24,943
What's your name?

581
01:06:30,752 --> 01:06:33,414
Even the servants of Apollo have names.

582
01:06:39,293 --> 01:06:41,124
Briseis.

583
01:06:44,232 --> 01:06:46,223
Are you afraid, Briseis?

584
01:06:47,301 --> 01:06:48,791
Should I be?

585
01:06:52,473 --> 01:06:53,963
My lord.

586
01:06:56,177 --> 01:06:58,907
Agamemnon requests your presence.

587
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:02,378
The kings are gathering
to celebrate the victory.

588
01:07:04,752 --> 01:07:06,549
You fought well today.

589
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:09,647
My lord.

590
01:07:14,729 --> 01:07:16,754
What do you want here in Troy?

591
01:07:17,732 --> 01:07:19,757
You didn't come for the Spartan queen.

592
01:07:19,934 --> 01:07:21,663
I want what all men want.

593
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:23,831
I just want it more.

594
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:32,371
You don't need to fear me, girl.

595
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,579
You're the only Trojan who can say that.

596
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:22,194
King Triopas, my lord.

597
01:08:23,998 --> 01:08:27,434
You have won a great victory,
my king of kings.

598
01:08:28,269 --> 01:08:32,535
No one thought the Trojan beach
could be captured so easily.

599
01:08:33,107 --> 01:08:35,439
A beautiful gift, Triopas.

600
01:08:36,177 --> 01:08:41,444
You will be among the first to walk
in the streets of Troy tomorrow.

601
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:49,385
My father, Neleus, had this urn made to
commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.

602
01:08:49,557 --> 01:08:51,388
I present it to you...

603
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:54,457
...in honor of an even more
memorable victory.

604
01:08:54,695 --> 01:08:56,287
Thank you, old friend.

605
01:08:56,931 --> 01:09:00,765
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper
in the gardens of Troy.

606
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,041
Leave us.

607
01:09:19,253 --> 01:09:23,781
War is young men dying and old men
talking. You know this.

608
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:26,051
Ignore the politics.

609
01:09:43,511 --> 01:09:45,308
Apparently, you won some great victory.

610
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:51,179
Perhaps you didn't notice. The Trojan
beach belonged to Priam in the morning.

611
01:09:51,352 --> 01:09:54,219
It belongs to Agamemnon
in the afternoon.

612
01:09:54,488 --> 01:09:56,718
Have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.

613
01:09:56,891 --> 01:09:58,188
No.

614
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:02,227
You came here because you want
your name to last through the ages.

615
01:10:04,632 --> 01:10:06,725
A great victory was won today.

616
01:10:08,135 --> 01:10:10,433
But that victory is not yours.

617
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:13,005
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.

618
01:10:13,174 --> 01:10:15,972
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.

619
01:10:16,143 --> 01:10:19,772
Perhaps the kings were too far behind
to see. Soldiers won the battle.

620
01:10:19,947 --> 01:10:22,211
History remembers kings!

621
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:24,446
Not soldiers.

622
01:10:26,554 --> 01:10:29,114
Tomorrow, we'll batter down
the gates of Troy.

623
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:32,053
I'll build monuments
on every island of Greece.

624
01:10:32,226 --> 01:10:35,286
I'll carve +ACI-Agamemnon+ACI- in the stone.

625
01:10:35,463 --> 01:10:37,988
My name will last through the ages.

626
01:10:38,165 --> 01:10:41,896
Your name is written in sand...

627
01:10:42,069 --> 01:10:44,003
...for the waves to wash away.

628
01:10:44,171 --> 01:10:48,665
Be careful, king of kings.
First, you need the victory.

629
01:10:53,547 --> 01:10:56,015
Your men sacked the temple
of Apollo, yes?

630
01:10:56,217 --> 01:10:57,878
You want gold? Take it.

631
01:10:58,085 --> 01:11:01,145
It's my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.

632
01:11:01,322 --> 01:11:03,222
I already have.

633
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:07,154
Aphareus!

634
01:11:08,429 --> 01:11:09,760
Haemon!

635
01:11:19,974 --> 01:11:21,134
The spoils of war.

636
01:11:21,676 --> 01:11:25,669
No argument with you, but if you don't
release her, you'll never see home again.

637
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,514
-Decide.
-Guards!

638
01:11:30,317 --> 01:11:31,875
Stop!

639
01:11:33,054 --> 01:11:35,022
Too many people have died today.

640
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:39,849
If killing is your only talent,
that's your curse.

641
01:11:40,695 --> 01:11:43,220
I don't want anyone dying for me.

642
01:11:51,806 --> 01:11:57,745
Mighty Achilles, silenced by a slave girl.

643
01:12:00,948 --> 01:12:05,248
Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath.

644
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:07,581
And then...

645
01:12:08,055 --> 01:12:10,523
-...who knows?
-You sack of wine!

646
01:12:12,193 --> 01:12:16,687
Before my time is done, I will look
down on your corpse and smile.

647
01:13:33,707 --> 01:13:37,666
If they want a war,
we will give them a war.

648
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:43,613
I would match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day.

649
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:47,981
The best of Greece outnumber
the best of Troy two to one.

650
01:13:48,155 --> 01:13:50,055
So, what do you suggest?

651
01:13:50,224 --> 01:13:51,851
We surrender our city?

652
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:56,051
We allow the Greeks to slaughter our men?
Rape our wives?

653
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:57,993
I suggest diplomacy.

654
01:13:58,165 --> 01:14:00,224
The Greeks came here for one thing.

655
01:14:00,401 --> 01:14:04,462
Let's be honest, my friends.
Trojans are now burning on the pyre...

656
01:14:05,339 --> 01:14:09,400
...because of one youthful indiscretion.

657
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:11,940
Glaucus.

658
01:14:12,413 --> 01:14:16,179
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?

659
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:19,046
Our walls have never been breached.

660
01:14:19,286 --> 01:14:21,584
We have the finest archers in the world.

661
01:14:22,089 --> 01:14:23,716
And we have Hector...

662
01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:28,453
...whose men would fight
the shades of Tartarus if he commanded.

663
01:14:28,629 --> 01:14:31,462
Yes, we can win.

664
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:43,506
I spoke with two farmers today.

665
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:48,848
They saw an eagle flying
with a serpent clutched in its talons.

666
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:52,542
This is a sign from Apollo.

667
01:14:52,853 --> 01:14:54,946
We will win a great victory tomorrow.

668
01:14:55,155 --> 01:14:56,679
Bird signs.

669
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:59,724
You want to plan a strategy
based on bird signs.

670
01:14:59,894 --> 01:15:01,418
Hector, show respect.

671
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:06,632
When Archeptolemus prophesied
four years of drought we dug deeper wells.

672
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,894
The drought came
and we had water to drink.

673
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:12,937
The high priest is a servant of the gods.

674
01:15:13,107 --> 01:15:15,098
And I am a servant of Troy.

675
01:15:16,911 --> 01:15:19,846
I've always honored the gods, Father.
You know that.

676
01:15:20,014 --> 01:15:23,541
But today I fought a Greek
who desecrated the statue of Apollo.

677
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:26,413
Apollo didn't strike the man down.

678
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:29,921
The gods won't fight this war for us.

679
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:33,023
There won't be a war.

680
01:15:38,065 --> 01:15:40,033
This is not a conflict of nations.

681
01:15:40,234 --> 01:15:42,464
It is a dispute between two men.

682
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:46,095
I don't want to see another Trojan die
because of me.

683
01:15:46,307 --> 01:15:48,002
Paris.

684
01:15:49,343 --> 01:15:52,870
Tomorrow morning, I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen.

685
01:15:53,047 --> 01:15:58,781
The winner will take her home.
The loser will burn before nightfall.

686
01:16:11,365 --> 01:16:12,696
Does he have a chance?

687
01:16:23,677 --> 01:16:25,235
Father...

688
01:16:26,447 --> 01:16:29,109
...I'm sorry for the pain I've caused you.

689
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:31,851
Do you love her?

690
01:16:34,521 --> 01:16:38,753
You are a great king because you love
your country so much.

691
01:16:39,293 --> 01:16:41,124
Every blade of grass.

692
01:16:42,196 --> 01:16:44,096
Every grain of sand.

693
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:45,831
Every rock in the river.

694
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,164
You love all of Troy.

695
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:53,904
That is the way I love Helen.

696
01:16:57,344 --> 01:17:00,438
I've fought many wars in my time.

697
01:17:01,749 --> 01:17:05,412
Some were fought for land,
some for power, some for glory.

698
01:17:07,321 --> 01:17:12,987
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest.

699
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,061
But I won't be the one fighting.

700
01:17:19,466 --> 01:17:21,127
The sword of Troy.

701
01:17:21,835 --> 01:17:25,498
My father carried this sword,
and his father before him...

702
01:17:25,672 --> 01:17:28,300
...all the way back
to the founding of Troy.

703
01:17:28,475 --> 01:17:32,605
The history of our people
was written with this sword.

704
01:17:34,982 --> 01:17:37,143
Carry it with you tomorrow.

705
01:17:40,721 --> 01:17:44,054
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.

706
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:49,188
So long as a Trojan carries it...

707
01:17:50,197 --> 01:17:52,791
...our people have a future.

708
01:17:56,937 --> 01:18:00,168
The man who killed Tecton
outside Apollo's temple...

709
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:03,871
...I've never seen a spear
thrown like that.

710
01:18:05,045 --> 01:18:06,603
An impossible throw.

711
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:12,314
He has no idea what's happening.

712
01:18:12,486 --> 01:18:13,544
Thank the gods.

713
01:18:15,222 --> 01:18:16,985
Don't go tomorrow.

714
01:18:17,991 --> 01:18:20,755
-Please don't go.
-Paris fights tomorrow, not me.

715
01:18:20,928 --> 01:18:26,366
Fifty thousand Greeks didn't cross the sea
to watch your brother fight. You know this.

716
01:18:28,702 --> 01:18:30,499
You'd make a fine general, my love.

717
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:35,199
You've been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.

718
01:18:35,509 --> 01:18:40,208
You know I don't want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.

719
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,473
I want to see the girls chasing after him.

720
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,812
Just like they chased his father.

721
01:18:46,887 --> 01:18:49,754
He's much more handsome than I ever was.

722
01:18:52,392 --> 01:18:53,859
I must see Paris.

723
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:55,858
I lost...

724
01:18:56,597 --> 01:18:58,588
...seven brothers...

725
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:01,332
...in the Spartan wars.

726
01:19:03,103 --> 01:19:05,901
You'd think I'd be good at losing by now.

727
01:19:08,775 --> 01:19:10,970
I can't lose you.

728
01:19:12,379 --> 01:19:14,176
I won't survive.

729
01:19:39,806 --> 01:19:41,330
Wait.

730
01:19:42,309 --> 01:19:43,776
Wait!

731
01:19:49,183 --> 01:19:50,582
Helen, what are you doing?

732
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:52,878
-Let me go.
-No.

733
01:20:00,093 --> 01:20:02,254
I saw them burn.

734
01:20:03,597 --> 01:20:06,225
I saw them burning on the pyres.

735
01:20:08,502 --> 01:20:10,094
That's my fault.

736
01:20:11,171 --> 01:20:13,901
It is. You know it is.

737
01:20:15,842 --> 01:20:17,639
All those widows.

738
01:20:18,712 --> 01:20:21,010
I still hear them screaming.

739
01:20:22,683 --> 01:20:25,846
Their husbands died because I'm here.

740
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,415
I'm going down to the ships.

741
01:20:28,589 --> 01:20:30,250
No, you're not.

742
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:33,459
I'm giving myself back to Menelaus.

743
01:20:33,794 --> 01:20:35,694
He can do what he wants.

744
01:20:35,862 --> 01:20:38,023
Kill me, make me his slave, I don't care.

745
01:20:38,198 --> 01:20:39,631
Anything is better than this.

746
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,427
It's too late for that.

747
01:20:41,602 --> 01:20:44,628
Do you think Agamemnon cares
about his brother's marriage?

748
01:20:44,805 --> 01:20:47,239
This is about power. Not love.

749
01:20:47,841 --> 01:20:50,241
Paris is going to fight in the morning.

750
01:20:51,278 --> 01:20:53,872
-Yes.
-Menelaus will kill him.

751
01:20:54,047 --> 01:20:55,378
I won't let that happen.

752
01:20:55,983 --> 01:20:58,008
-It's his decision.
-No.

753
01:20:58,318 --> 01:21:01,014
I can't ask anyone to fight for me.

754
01:21:02,456 --> 01:21:04,651
I'm no longer queen of Sparta.

755
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:09,290
You're a princess of Troy now...

756
01:21:10,697 --> 01:21:13,222
...and my brother needs you tonight.

757
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,661
My lord.

758
01:21:52,706 --> 01:21:54,731
The army is marching.

759
01:21:56,143 --> 01:21:58,043
Let them march. We stay.

760
01:21:59,212 --> 01:22:00,406
But the men are ready.

761
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:03,378
We stay till Agamemnon groans
to have Achilles back.

762
01:22:05,085 --> 01:22:06,416
As you wish.

763
01:22:24,905 --> 01:22:26,463
Are you ready to fight?

764
01:22:27,674 --> 01:22:28,663
I am.

765
01:22:28,842 --> 01:22:31,242
Are you ready to kill? To take life?

766
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:45,055
At night, I see their faces,
all the men I've killed.

767
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:49,162
They're standing there on the far bank
of the River Styx.

768
01:22:52,232 --> 01:22:53,927
They're waiting for me.

769
01:22:56,069 --> 01:22:58,060
They say, +ACI-Welcome, brother.+ACI-

770
01:23:05,278 --> 01:23:07,212
We men are wretched things.

771
01:23:12,519 --> 01:23:16,250
I taught you how to fight,
but I never taught you why to fight.

772
01:23:16,723 --> 01:23:17,951
I fight for you.

773
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:20,116
Who will you fight for when I'm gone?

774
01:23:22,963 --> 01:23:26,194
Soldiers, they fight for kings
they've never even met.

775
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,930
They do what they're told,
die when they're told to.

776
01:23:31,371 --> 01:23:32,736
Soldiers obey.

777
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,345
Don't waste your life following
some fool's orders.

778
01:23:47,754 --> 01:23:49,153
Go.

779
01:25:14,174 --> 01:25:16,142
Are you sure you want to do this?

780
01:25:17,244 --> 01:25:18,973
I started this war.

781
01:25:34,628 --> 01:25:36,528
Helen...

782
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:39,164
...sit with me.

783
01:25:48,408 --> 01:25:52,902
All my life I have prayed against this day.

784
01:25:54,281 --> 01:25:55,976
Yes, my king.

785
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:59,141
Call me Father, dear child.

786
01:26:02,889 --> 01:26:05,119
Forgive me, Father...

787
01:26:06,393 --> 01:26:07,883
...for bringing this.

788
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:10,928
I blame you for nothing.

789
01:26:11,264 --> 01:26:15,166
Everything is in the hands of the gods.

790
01:26:15,502 --> 01:26:17,060
Besides...

791
01:26:17,237 --> 01:26:21,799
...how could I blame anyone
for falling in love with Paris?

792
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,637
Prepare to halt!

793
01:28:35,809 --> 01:28:37,538
Prepare to halt!

794
01:28:37,877 --> 01:28:39,469
Halt!

795
01:28:58,832 --> 01:29:00,493
Move.

796
01:29:10,844 --> 01:29:12,334
Menelaus is a bull.

797
01:29:12,512 --> 01:29:16,915
He'll charge you,
but keep your distance and use your speed.

798
01:29:18,318 --> 01:29:19,615
Brother...

799
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,581
...you don't have to do this.

800
01:29:43,977 --> 01:29:48,311
I see you're not hiding behind
your high walls. Valiant of you.

801
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:51,245
ill-advised, but valiant.

802
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:55,148
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.

803
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:57,312
We've come too far, Prince Hector.

804
01:29:57,490 --> 01:29:59,958
Prince? What prince?

805
01:30:00,126 --> 01:30:02,959
What son of a king would accept
a man's hospitality...

806
01:30:03,129 --> 01:30:07,463
...eat his food, drink his wine, then steal
his wife in the middle of the night?

807
01:30:07,634 --> 01:30:09,693
The sun was shining
when your wife left you.

808
01:30:11,771 --> 01:30:14,638
She's up there, watching,
isn't she? Good.

809
01:30:14,808 --> 01:30:17,038
I want her to watch you die.

810
01:30:18,044 --> 01:30:19,375
Not yet, brother.

811
01:30:21,481 --> 01:30:23,278
Look around you, Hector.

812
01:30:23,449 --> 01:30:27,010
I brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores.

813
01:30:27,187 --> 01:30:29,178
You can still save Troy, young prince.

814
01:30:29,355 --> 01:30:30,822
I have two wishes.

815
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:34,323
If you grant them,
no more of your people need die.

816
01:30:34,527 --> 01:30:37,496
First, you must give Helen
back to my brother.

817
01:30:37,897 --> 01:30:41,230
Second, Troy must submit
to my command...

818
01:30:41,501 --> 01:30:44,129
...to fight for me whenever I call.

819
01:30:44,304 --> 01:30:47,330
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble?

820
01:30:49,642 --> 01:30:51,132
Well, I see them.

821
01:30:51,644 --> 01:30:56,343
I see 50,000 men brought here
to fight for one man's greed.

822
01:31:00,086 --> 01:31:01,610
Careful, boy.

823
01:31:02,889 --> 01:31:04,686
My mercy has limits.

824
01:31:04,858 --> 01:31:07,258
And I've seen the limits of your mercy.

825
01:31:07,427 --> 01:31:11,887
And I tell you now, no son of Troy
will ever submit to a foreign ruler.

826
01:31:12,165 --> 01:31:16,295
Then every son of Troy shall die.

827
01:31:19,572 --> 01:31:21,437
There is another way.

828
01:31:23,643 --> 01:31:27,841
I love Helen. I won't give her up
and neither will you.

829
01:31:28,014 --> 01:31:29,675
So let us fight our own battle.

830
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:33,613
The winner takes Helen home.
And let that be the end of it.

831
01:31:33,786 --> 01:31:37,483
A brave offer, but not enough.

832
01:31:38,992 --> 01:31:40,721
Let me kill this little peacock.

833
01:31:40,894 --> 01:31:45,661
I didn't come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.

834
01:31:45,832 --> 01:31:48,096
I came for my honor.

835
01:31:48,268 --> 01:31:50,702
His every breath insults me.

836
01:31:51,271 --> 01:31:54,638
Let me kill him. When he's lying
in the dust, signal to attack.

837
01:31:54,807 --> 01:31:57,970
You'll have your city.
I'll have my revenge.

838
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:05,016
So be it.

839
01:32:09,355 --> 01:32:13,621
I accept your challenge. And tonight,
I'll drink to your bones.

840
01:32:23,269 --> 01:32:26,363
-My lord.
-Back to the line!

841
01:32:41,054 --> 01:32:43,318
Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.

842
01:32:45,024 --> 01:32:46,389
Brother...

843
01:32:46,559 --> 01:32:49,619
...if I fall, tell Helen-- Tell her--

844
01:32:49,796 --> 01:32:51,525
I will.

845
01:32:51,698 --> 01:32:53,791
Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he--

846
01:32:53,967 --> 01:32:57,368
You think of your sword and his sword
and nothing else.

847
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:10,669
Get up.

848
01:34:11,077 --> 01:34:12,772
Come on.

849
01:34:58,091 --> 01:34:59,524
See the crows?

850
01:35:01,494 --> 01:35:03,621
They never tasted prince before.

851
01:35:37,997 --> 01:35:42,400
Is this what you left me for?!

852
01:35:42,568 --> 01:35:44,229
Fight!

853
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:45,901
Fight me!

854
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:48,267
You coward!

855
01:35:48,441 --> 01:35:49,703
Fight me!

856
01:35:49,876 --> 01:35:52,276
We have a pact! Fight!

857
01:35:52,812 --> 01:35:55,781
Fight him, son. Fight him.

858
01:35:55,948 --> 01:35:59,714
-Fight me!
-The Trojans have violated the agreement!

859
01:35:59,886 --> 01:36:02,446
Prepare for battle!

860
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:05,521
This is not honor!

861
01:36:05,791 --> 01:36:08,225
This is not worthy of royalty!

862
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:11,789
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.

863
01:36:12,698 --> 01:36:13,892
Paris.

864
01:36:15,401 --> 01:36:17,369
No. No.

865
01:36:18,137 --> 01:36:19,399
The fight is over.

866
01:36:19,572 --> 01:36:21,767
The fight is not over.

867
01:36:21,941 --> 01:36:23,636
Stand back, Prince Hector.

868
01:36:23,809 --> 01:36:26,471
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.

869
01:36:26,646 --> 01:36:27,943
He is my brother.

870
01:37:23,536 --> 01:37:25,265
Paris!

871
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,075
Go! Go!

872
01:37:42,922 --> 01:37:44,753
Get inside, Paris!

873
01:37:45,324 --> 01:37:46,621
Archers!

874
01:37:50,062 --> 01:37:53,259
-Our men are too close to the walls.
-Pull back.

875
01:37:53,432 --> 01:37:55,127
Pull back, you fool!

876
01:37:55,401 --> 01:37:56,629
For Troy!

877
01:37:56,802 --> 01:37:57,928
For Troy!

878
01:38:24,463 --> 01:38:26,624
-Now!
-Loose!

879
01:38:58,230 --> 01:38:59,663
Get them in line!

880
01:39:06,072 --> 01:39:09,041
Get the men back into lines!

881
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:11,608
Front line, push!

882
01:40:20,946 --> 01:40:23,779
So you're the best of the Trojans.

883
01:41:39,058 --> 01:41:40,548
Forward.

884
01:41:40,726 --> 01:41:41,954
Forward!

885
01:41:58,410 --> 01:41:59,707
Forward!

886
01:42:14,627 --> 01:42:16,993
Apollonians! Now!

887
01:42:30,976 --> 01:42:32,307
Prince Hector!

888
01:42:40,486 --> 01:42:41,817
We need to retreat!

889
01:42:42,788 --> 01:42:44,983
My army's never lost a battle yet!

890
01:42:45,157 --> 01:42:47,648
You won't have an army
if you don't fall back!

891
01:42:56,035 --> 01:42:58,094
Back to the ships!

892
01:42:58,270 --> 01:42:59,965
-Back to the ships!
-Retreat!

893
01:43:00,139 --> 01:43:01,128
-Back!
-Retreat!

894
01:43:01,307 --> 01:43:03,104
Go back!

895
01:43:11,283 --> 01:43:13,114
Back. Back to the ships!

896
01:44:19,718 --> 01:44:21,276
Fall back!

897
01:44:21,687 --> 01:44:24,178
-Men, fall back!
-Halt!

898
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:32,863
Halt!

899
01:44:33,065 --> 01:44:34,532
But we have them on the run!

900
01:44:34,767 --> 01:44:36,962
We're in range of their archers.

901
01:44:37,136 --> 01:44:39,036
Have our men gather our fallen.

902
01:44:39,204 --> 01:44:42,139
Send an emissary to them.
They can collect their dead.

903
01:44:42,307 --> 01:44:44,798
Would they have done the same for us?

904
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:49,372
Go! Back!

905
01:44:50,249 --> 01:44:51,944
Fall back into line!

906
01:45:56,648 --> 01:45:58,843
Before I leave...

907
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:02,645
...I will burn their city to the ground.

908
01:46:02,821 --> 01:46:06,655
Brother, I promise you that.

909
01:46:35,154 --> 01:46:40,387
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!

910
01:46:40,793 --> 01:46:43,762
They think I'll sail home at first light.

911
01:46:43,929 --> 01:46:45,294
Maybe we should.

912
01:46:45,464 --> 01:46:47,762
Flee? Like a whipped dog?

913
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,595
The men believe we came here
for Menelaus' wife.

914
01:46:52,871 --> 01:46:54,532
Won't be needing her anymore.

915
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:57,868
My brother's blood still wets the sand,
and you insult him!

916
01:46:58,076 --> 01:47:00,704
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.

917
01:47:00,913 --> 01:47:04,007
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.

918
01:47:04,216 --> 01:47:08,653
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?

919
01:47:08,821 --> 01:47:13,281
If we stay, we stay here
for the right reasons.

920
01:47:13,458 --> 01:47:15,653
To protect Greece, not your pride.

921
01:47:15,828 --> 01:47:18,558
Your private battle with Achilles
is destroying us.

922
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:19,958
Achilles is one man.

923
01:47:20,132 --> 01:47:22,566
Hector is one man.

924
01:47:23,135 --> 01:47:24,568
Look what he did to us today.

925
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:28,729
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!

926
01:47:28,907 --> 01:47:33,674
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.

927
01:47:33,912 --> 01:47:35,436
He's right.

928
01:47:35,614 --> 01:47:37,081
The men's morale is weak.

929
01:47:37,249 --> 01:47:40,377
Weak? They're ready to swim home.

930
01:47:40,552 --> 01:47:45,455
Even if I could make peace with Achilles,
the man won't listen to me!

931
01:47:46,325 --> 01:47:49,783
He's as likely to spear me
as to speak to me!

932
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:52,797
I'll talk to him.

933
01:47:53,398 --> 01:47:54,797
He'll want the girl back.

934
01:47:55,367 --> 01:47:56,664
He can have that damn girl.

935
01:48:00,539 --> 01:48:01,733
I haven't touched her.

936
01:48:02,674 --> 01:48:03,971
Where is she?

937
01:48:05,544 --> 01:48:07,171
I gave her to the men.

938
01:48:09,181 --> 01:48:13,845
They need some amusement after today.

939
01:48:17,723 --> 01:48:19,987
Come on, give the bitch to me!

940
01:48:20,626 --> 01:48:21,991
Who's first?

941
01:48:22,761 --> 01:48:24,285
Trojan whore!

942
01:48:24,463 --> 01:48:26,397
What's this? A virgin's robe?

943
01:48:26,698 --> 01:48:29,724
-You won't be needing that for much longer!
-Hold her.

944
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:37,607
Come on. Come on. Hold her down.

945
01:49:11,009 --> 01:49:12,840
Are you hurt?

946
01:49:18,984 --> 01:49:21,248
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.

947
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:25,948
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.

948
01:49:49,314 --> 01:49:50,804
Eat.

949
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:01,449
I've known men like you my whole life.

950
01:50:03,195 --> 01:50:04,321
No, you haven't.

951
01:50:04,496 --> 01:50:06,828
You think you're so different
from 1000 others?

952
01:50:07,699 --> 01:50:11,567
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.

953
01:50:11,803 --> 01:50:14,169
-And you hate these soldiers.
-I pity them.

954
01:50:15,107 --> 01:50:17,837
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.

955
01:50:18,343 --> 01:50:21,039
Perhaps they deserve more than your pity.

956
01:50:24,016 --> 01:50:25,608
Why did you choose this life?

957
01:50:26,051 --> 01:50:28,315
-What life?
-To be a great warrior.

958
01:50:30,856 --> 01:50:34,587
I chose nothing. I was born,
and this is what I am.

959
01:50:36,128 --> 01:50:39,222
And you? Why did you choose
to love a god?

960
01:50:40,165 --> 01:50:43,157
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.

961
01:50:45,771 --> 01:50:47,363
Do you enjoy provoking me?

962
01:50:49,307 --> 01:50:51,366
You've dedicated your life to the gods.

963
01:50:51,543 --> 01:50:55,172
Zeus, god of thunder. Athena,
goddess of wisdom. You serve them.

964
01:50:55,347 --> 01:50:57,872
-Yes, of course.
-And Ares, god of war?

965
01:50:58,050 --> 01:51:01,042
Who blankets his bed with the skin
of men he's killed?

966
01:51:02,788 --> 01:51:05,621
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

967
01:51:16,902 --> 01:51:18,460
I'll tell you a secret...

968
01:51:19,071 --> 01:51:21,733
...something they don't teach you
in your temple.

969
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:34,616
The gods envy us.

970
01:51:36,321 --> 01:51:38,380
They envy us because we're mortal.

971
01:51:39,958 --> 01:51:42,791
Because any moment might be our last.

972
01:51:43,061 --> 01:51:46,360
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

973
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:50,534
You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

974
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:56,569
We will never be here again.

975
01:52:07,352 --> 01:52:09,343
I thought you were a dumb brute.

976
01:52:12,958 --> 01:52:14,949
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.

977
01:52:39,284 --> 01:52:40,512
Do it.

978
01:52:47,058 --> 01:52:48,582
Nothing is easier.

979
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:49,988
Aren't you afraid?

980
01:52:52,264 --> 01:52:56,860
Everyone dies. Today or 50 years
from now. What does it matter?

981
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:03,437
Do it.

982
01:53:05,043 --> 01:53:07,204
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.

983
01:53:07,379 --> 01:53:08,971
Many.

984
01:54:43,908 --> 01:54:45,398
My lord, there's--

985
01:55:00,258 --> 01:55:04,024
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We're going home.

986
01:55:07,999 --> 01:55:09,762
Gather the stores.

987
01:55:09,934 --> 01:55:11,799
Prepare the ship.

988
01:55:12,771 --> 01:55:14,466
Prepare the ship.

989
01:55:14,739 --> 01:55:17,173
Agamemnon is a proud man.

990
01:55:18,243 --> 01:55:20,643
But he knows when he's made a mistake.

991
01:55:20,812 --> 01:55:23,042
The man sends you
to make his apologies?

992
01:55:25,183 --> 01:55:27,913
What are you doing enthralled
to that pig of a king?

993
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:31,184
The world seems simple to you,
my friend...

994
01:55:31,356 --> 01:55:34,848
...but when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.

995
01:55:36,861 --> 01:55:39,694
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy
like Agamemnon.

996
01:55:39,864 --> 01:55:41,525
Are we supposed to fear him?

997
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:46,569
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem. Fear is useful.

998
01:55:49,774 --> 01:55:51,241
We need you back.

999
01:55:51,476 --> 01:55:53,239
Greece needs you.

1000
01:55:54,179 --> 01:55:56,909
Greece got along fine before I was born.

1001
01:55:57,082 --> 01:55:59,312
Greece will be Greece long after I'm dead.

1002
01:55:59,484 --> 01:56:01,543
I'm not talking about the land.

1003
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,950
The men need you.

1004
01:56:07,425 --> 01:56:08,983
Stay, Achilles.

1005
01:56:09,994 --> 01:56:11,552
You were born for this war.

1006
01:56:15,467 --> 01:56:17,059
Things are less simple today.

1007
01:56:19,070 --> 01:56:23,336
Women have a way
of complicating things.

1008
01:56:27,078 --> 01:56:30,343
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.

1009
01:56:30,648 --> 01:56:32,707
But in this war, you're a servant.

1010
01:56:32,884 --> 01:56:36,012
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

1011
01:56:37,655 --> 01:56:40,522
I hope you understand that one day.

1012
01:56:45,764 --> 01:56:46,992
We're going home?

1013
01:56:51,569 --> 01:56:52,797
We sail in the morning.

1014
01:56:53,104 --> 01:56:56,540
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can't just sail away.

1015
01:56:56,741 --> 01:57:00,541
If it's fighting you still long for,
there will always be another war.

1016
01:57:00,745 --> 01:57:02,144
These are our countrymen.

1017
01:57:02,747 --> 01:57:05,875
I ate, laughed, mourned with these men
while you hid in your tent.

1018
01:57:06,985 --> 01:57:09,977
You betray all of Greece
just to see Agamemnon fall.

1019
01:57:29,890 --> 01:57:32,290
The omens are gathering.

1020
01:57:32,493 --> 01:57:34,290
The directive is clear.

1021
01:57:34,461 --> 01:57:36,725
Fight for your country,
that's the only directive.

1022
01:57:36,897 --> 01:57:41,800
Last time the high priest spoke to us,
he prophesied a great victory for Troy.

1023
01:57:41,969 --> 01:57:45,735
We won a great victory. Let him speak.

1024
01:57:46,373 --> 01:57:48,807
What course of action
do you recommend?

1025
01:57:49,109 --> 01:57:51,475
The gods favor our cause.

1026
01:57:51,645 --> 01:57:54,876
Now is the time to destroy
the Greek army.

1027
01:57:56,483 --> 01:57:57,780
Glaucus?

1028
01:57:58,652 --> 01:58:00,950
Their morale is battered.

1029
01:58:01,121 --> 01:58:04,318
Hit them now. Hit them hard.

1030
01:58:04,491 --> 01:58:06,322
And they will run.

1031
01:58:09,196 --> 01:58:12,791
I must admit,
I overestimated the Greeks.

1032
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:16,230
They lack discipline and courage.

1033
01:58:23,344 --> 01:58:27,644
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday. There
must be dissension among the Greeks.

1034
01:58:27,815 --> 01:58:30,443
But if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

1035
01:58:31,218 --> 01:58:33,209
If they decide to attack us, let them.

1036
01:58:33,387 --> 01:58:36,288
Our walls can't be breached.
We'll beat them back again.

1037
01:58:40,427 --> 01:58:42,918
Yesterday, the Greeks underestimated us.

1038
01:58:43,897 --> 01:58:46,024
We should not return the favor.

1039
01:58:59,813 --> 01:59:02,509
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

1040
01:59:02,683 --> 01:59:06,346
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo.

1041
01:59:06,854 --> 01:59:09,823
The gods have cursed the Greeks.

1042
01:59:10,324 --> 01:59:14,124
Two of their kings
have already gone down to the dust.

1043
01:59:19,233 --> 01:59:22,066
Prepare the army. We attack at daybreak.

1044
01:59:22,236 --> 01:59:23,726
Father.

1045
01:59:24,738 --> 01:59:26,706
We're making a mistake.

1046
01:59:29,209 --> 01:59:30,506
Prepare the army.

1047
01:59:48,562 --> 01:59:50,154
Come on.

1048
02:00:17,825 --> 02:00:19,918
Am I still your captive?

1049
02:00:22,796 --> 02:00:24,354
You're my guest.

1050
02:00:26,967 --> 02:00:30,095
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

1051
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:31,931
You should leave, then.

1052
02:00:38,879 --> 02:00:40,904
Would you leave this all behind?

1053
02:00:45,352 --> 02:00:47,013
Would you leave Troy?

1054
02:03:47,501 --> 02:03:49,332
Hold those barricades!

1055
02:04:10,190 --> 02:04:12,158
Archers to the rear.

1056
02:04:21,535 --> 02:04:23,696
Achilles.

1057
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:48,691
Achilles.

1058
02:04:51,598 --> 02:04:53,190
Now!

1059
02:05:02,342 --> 02:05:03,741
Forward!

1060
02:07:58,151 --> 02:07:59,743
Enough for one day.

1061
02:08:01,922 --> 02:08:03,184
Yes.

1062
02:08:04,691 --> 02:08:06,181
Back to the ships!

1063
02:08:06,359 --> 02:08:08,793
Back to the ships!

1064
02:08:10,597 --> 02:08:12,326
It was his cousin.

1065
02:08:16,703 --> 02:08:18,261
To Troy!

1066
02:08:19,206 --> 02:08:21,367
Back to the city!

1067
02:08:22,309 --> 02:08:23,674
To Troy!

1068
02:08:25,779 --> 02:08:27,940
We were going to sail home today.

1069
02:08:30,784 --> 02:08:33,446
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.

1070
02:08:54,207 --> 02:08:55,640
Achilles.

1071
02:09:11,157 --> 02:09:13,022
You violated my command.

1072
02:09:13,793 --> 02:09:17,092
No, my lord. There was a mistake.

1073
02:09:18,031 --> 02:09:20,556
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.

1074
02:09:20,834 --> 02:09:22,961
You led them into combat.

1075
02:09:27,874 --> 02:09:31,742
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.

1076
02:09:39,486 --> 02:09:40,748
Where's Patroclus?

1077
02:09:43,723 --> 02:09:45,418
Patroclus!

1078
02:09:45,892 --> 02:09:48,156
We thought he was you, my lord.

1079
02:09:50,630 --> 02:09:56,364
He wore your armor, your shield,
your greaves, your helmet.

1080
02:09:57,304 --> 02:09:59,101
He even moved like you.

1081
02:09:59,873 --> 02:10:01,966
Where is he?

1082
02:10:05,779 --> 02:10:07,644
-Where?
-He's dead, my lord.

1083
02:10:08,715 --> 02:10:10,205
Hector cut his throat.

1084
02:10:21,061 --> 02:10:23,495
Don't. Don't.

1085
02:10:56,262 --> 02:10:58,025
Where are you taking me?

1086
02:11:03,837 --> 02:11:05,805
Do you remember how to get here?

1087
02:11:06,373 --> 02:11:08,000
Yes.

1088
02:11:15,548 --> 02:11:18,574
The next time you come here,
follow the tunnel.

1089
02:11:18,752 --> 02:11:21,846
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.

1090
02:11:22,021 --> 02:11:23,420
Why?

1091
02:11:23,923 --> 02:11:26,414
When you get to the end,
you'll be by the river.

1092
02:11:26,593 --> 02:11:29,027
Follow the river until you get
to Mount Ida.

1093
02:11:29,863 --> 02:11:32,229
The Greeks won't go that far inland.

1094
02:11:33,032 --> 02:11:34,659
Hector.

1095
02:11:35,368 --> 02:11:37,029
Why are you telling me this?

1096
02:11:42,609 --> 02:11:44,076
-If I die--
-No.

1097
02:11:44,244 --> 02:11:47,475
If I die, I don't know how long
the city will stand.

1098
02:11:47,914 --> 02:11:49,074
Don't say that.

1099
02:11:49,249 --> 02:11:51,479
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over.

1100
02:11:52,218 --> 02:11:55,619
They'll kill all the men, throw
the babies from the city walls.

1101
02:11:55,789 --> 02:11:58,155
-Please.
-The women, they'll take as slaves.

1102
02:11:58,324 --> 02:12:01,020
That, for you, will be worse than dying.

1103
02:12:01,261 --> 02:12:03,957
Why are you saying such things?

1104
02:12:06,866 --> 02:12:08,800
Because I want you to be ready.

1105
02:12:11,171 --> 02:12:15,005
I want you to get our boy,
and I want you to bring him here.

1106
02:12:16,342 --> 02:12:20,870
You save as many people as you can,
but you get here. And you run.

1107
02:12:22,549 --> 02:12:23,743
Do you understand?

1108
02:12:31,090 --> 02:12:32,819
I killed a boy today.

1109
02:12:34,761 --> 02:12:36,422
And he was young.

1110
02:12:37,597 --> 02:12:39,428
He was much too young.

1111
02:13:14,567 --> 02:13:17,400
That boy has just saved this war for us.

1112
02:15:05,078 --> 02:15:07,239
-Eudorus.
-My lord.

1113
02:15:07,413 --> 02:15:09,176
I need my armor.

1114
02:16:10,109 --> 02:16:11,406
No.

1115
02:16:12,979 --> 02:16:14,310
Don't go!

1116
02:16:15,181 --> 02:16:17,081
Rope!

1117
02:16:17,250 --> 02:16:19,616
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.

1118
02:16:20,186 --> 02:16:22,984
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.

1119
02:16:23,389 --> 02:16:25,323
Please.

1120
02:17:41,868 --> 02:17:43,199
No.

1121
02:18:09,095 --> 02:18:11,086
Hector!

1122
02:18:17,303 --> 02:18:18,998
Hector!

1123
02:18:26,946 --> 02:18:28,880
Hector!

1124
02:18:33,886 --> 02:18:35,410
Hector!

1125
02:18:39,325 --> 02:18:41,293
Father...

1126
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:43,826
...forgive me for any offenses.

1127
02:18:45,698 --> 02:18:47,962
I've served you as best as I could.

1128
02:18:48,534 --> 02:18:50,195
Hector!

1129
02:18:54,473 --> 02:18:56,873
May the gods be with you.

1130
02:19:01,247 --> 02:19:02,475
Hector.

1131
02:19:05,284 --> 02:19:08,617
No father ever had a better son.

1132
02:19:15,294 --> 02:19:16,852
Hector!

1133
02:19:18,731 --> 02:19:20,358
Apollo guard you, my prince.

1134
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:29,039
You're the best man I know.

1135
02:19:35,281 --> 02:19:37,146
You're a prince of Troy.

1136
02:19:37,917 --> 02:19:39,441
I know you'll make me proud.

1137
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:49,922
Hector!

1138
02:20:06,946 --> 02:20:09,039
Remember what I told you.

1139
02:20:09,849 --> 02:20:12,841
You don't have to go. You don't.

1140
02:20:13,119 --> 02:20:14,916
You remember what I told you.

1141
02:20:33,272 --> 02:20:35,672
Hector!

1142
02:20:51,190 --> 02:20:53,784
Hector!

1143
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:10,462
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

1144
02:22:12,638 --> 02:22:14,003
I'll make a pact with you.

1145
02:22:14,940 --> 02:22:16,999
With the gods as our witnesses...

1146
02:22:17,176 --> 02:22:21,875
...let us pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral rituals.

1147
02:22:22,048 --> 02:22:25,040
There are no pacts
between lions and men.

1148
02:22:33,059 --> 02:22:35,357
Now you know who you're fighting.

1149
02:22:43,869 --> 02:22:46,702
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.

1150
02:22:47,039 --> 02:22:51,032
And I wish it had been you. But I gave
the dead boy the honor he deserved.

1151
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:53,201
You gave him the honor of your sword.

1152
02:22:54,146 --> 02:22:57,081
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.

1153
02:22:57,249 --> 02:23:01,447
You'll wander the underworld, blind, deaf,
and dumb, and all the dead will know:

1154
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:05,317
This is Hector, the fool who thought
he killed Achilles.

1155
02:25:03,409 --> 02:25:04,706
Get up, prince of Troy.

1156
02:25:07,346 --> 02:25:10,315
Get up. I won't let a stone take my glory.

1157
02:28:43,128 --> 02:28:44,993
You lost your cousin.

1158
02:28:46,832 --> 02:28:48,663
Now you've taken mine.

1159
02:28:52,137 --> 02:28:53,729
When does it end?

1160
02:28:55,774 --> 02:28:57,298
It never ends.

1161
02:29:57,236 --> 02:29:58,794
Who are you?

1162
02:29:58,971 --> 02:30:04,841
I have endured what no one
on earth has endured before.

1163
02:30:05,511 --> 02:30:10,813
I kissed the hands of the man
who killed my son.

1164
02:30:17,956 --> 02:30:19,583
Priam?

1165
02:30:21,159 --> 02:30:22,524
How did you get in here?

1166
02:30:22,694 --> 02:30:26,653
I know my own country better
than the Greeks, I think.

1167
02:30:31,403 --> 02:30:33,837
You're a brave man.

1168
02:30:36,608 --> 02:30:39,805
I could have your head on a spit
in the blink of an eye.

1169
02:30:40,178 --> 02:30:43,978
Do you really think death
frightens me now?

1170
02:30:45,717 --> 02:30:48,277
I watched my eldest son die...

1171
02:30:48,453 --> 02:30:52,355
...watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

1172
02:30:55,561 --> 02:30:57,722
Give him back to me.

1173
02:30:58,830 --> 02:31:03,324
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.

1174
02:31:04,269 --> 02:31:06,499
Give him to me.

1175
02:31:07,406 --> 02:31:09,101
He killed my cousin.

1176
02:31:09,274 --> 02:31:11,242
He thought it was you.

1177
02:31:13,845 --> 02:31:16,541
How many cousins have you killed?

1178
02:31:18,083 --> 02:31:21,985
How many sons and fathers
and brothers and husbands?

1179
02:31:22,220 --> 02:31:24,780
How many, brave Achilles?

1180
02:31:29,695 --> 02:31:31,788
I knew your father.

1181
02:31:32,931 --> 02:31:35,229
He died before his time.

1182
02:31:36,501 --> 02:31:41,700
But he was lucky not to live long enough
to see his son fall.

1183
02:31:46,612 --> 02:31:49,274
You have taken everything from me.

1184
02:31:51,383 --> 02:31:53,180
My eldest son...

1185
02:31:53,819 --> 02:31:55,616
...heir to my throne...

1186
02:31:56,054 --> 02:31:58,648
...defender of my kingdom.

1187
02:32:00,025 --> 02:32:04,689
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.

1188
02:32:05,998 --> 02:32:09,331
But give me this small mercy.

1189
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:15,800
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes...

1190
02:32:15,974 --> 02:32:18,807
...till the moment you closed them.

1191
02:32:21,246 --> 02:32:24,238
Let me wash his body.

1192
02:32:25,851 --> 02:32:29,082
Let me say the prayers.

1193
02:32:30,355 --> 02:32:35,383
Let me place two coins on his eyes
for the boatman.

1194
02:32:40,132 --> 02:32:42,362
If I let you walk out of here...

1195
02:32:44,670 --> 02:32:46,604
...if I let you take him...

1196
02:32:49,241 --> 02:32:51,300
...it doesn't change anything.

1197
02:32:52,878 --> 02:32:55,540
You're still my enemy in the morning.

1198
02:32:56,682 --> 02:32:59,708
You're still my enemy tonight.

1199
02:33:00,752 --> 02:33:04,347
But even enemies can show respect.

1200
02:33:24,042 --> 02:33:25,475
I admire your courage.

1201
02:33:33,185 --> 02:33:34,948
Meet me outside in a moment.

1202
02:34:21,032 --> 02:34:22,727
We'll meet again soon, my brother.

1203
02:34:57,402 --> 02:34:59,802
Your son was the best I've fought.

1204
02:35:03,041 --> 02:35:05,703
In my country, the funeral games
last for 1 2 days.

1205
02:35:06,244 --> 02:35:08,337
It is the same in my country.

1206
02:35:09,114 --> 02:35:11,275
Then the prince will have that honor.

1207
02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:15,449
No Greek will attack Troy for 1 2 days.

1208
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:22,925
Briseis?

1209
02:35:26,031 --> 02:35:28,397
I thought you were dead.

1210
02:35:39,110 --> 02:35:40,372
You are free.

1211
02:35:56,828 --> 02:35:58,523
If I hurt you...

1212
02:36:00,899 --> 02:36:03,129
...it's not what I wanted.

1213
02:36:17,649 --> 02:36:18,911
Go.

1214
02:36:19,351 --> 02:36:22,514
No one will stop you. You have my word.

1215
02:36:23,321 --> 02:36:24,948
Come, my girl.

1216
02:36:32,130 --> 02:36:35,861
You're a far better king than the one
leading this army.

1217
02:36:52,384 --> 02:36:56,320
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I
have to honor it? What treason is this?

1218
02:36:56,755 --> 02:37:00,748
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 1 2 days of peace.

1219
02:37:00,926 --> 02:37:03,053
Peace! Peace!

1220
02:37:03,361 --> 02:37:06,057
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.

1221
02:37:06,231 --> 02:37:07,858
This is the time to attack!

1222
02:37:08,166 --> 02:37:12,364
Even with Hector gone, we have
no way to breach their walls.

1223
02:37:12,938 --> 02:37:15,338
They can wait 10 years for us to leave.

1224
02:37:16,608 --> 02:37:19,304
I will smash their walls to the ground...

1225
02:37:19,477 --> 02:37:22,071
...if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.

1226
02:37:22,247 --> 02:37:24,875
Hear me, Zeus!

1227
02:37:25,050 --> 02:37:28,747
I will smash their walls to the ground.

1228
02:39:16,061 --> 02:39:17,460
That's good.

1229
02:39:17,862 --> 02:39:19,762
For my son back home.

1230
02:39:46,624 --> 02:39:48,182
Well, Odysseus.

1231
02:39:49,194 --> 02:39:53,858
You found a way to make the sheep
invite the wolves to dinner.

1232
02:40:12,250 --> 02:40:15,947
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.

1233
02:40:18,256 --> 02:40:21,350
You've been a loyal friend all your life.

1234
02:40:24,562 --> 02:40:27,190
I hope I never disappoint you again.

1235
02:40:27,565 --> 02:40:30,033
It's I who have been the disappointment.

1236
02:40:33,571 --> 02:40:36,199
Rouse the men. You're taking them home.

1237
02:40:38,543 --> 02:40:40,374
Aren't you coming with us?

1238
02:40:41,179 --> 02:40:43,374
I have my own battle to fight.

1239
02:40:43,915 --> 02:40:45,542
Let me march beside you.

1240
02:40:45,717 --> 02:40:49,551
No. I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

1241
02:40:55,660 --> 02:40:57,491
It's a beautiful night.

1242
02:40:58,163 --> 02:41:01,462
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.

1243
02:41:07,438 --> 02:41:10,566
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

1244
02:41:24,278 --> 02:41:26,974
Open the gates!
Open the gates!

1245
02:41:41,128 --> 02:41:42,789
Here.

1246
02:42:09,156 --> 02:42:10,817
Plague.

1247
02:42:11,492 --> 02:42:14,086
Don't go too close, my king.

1248
02:42:14,862 --> 02:42:17,092
This is the will of the gods.

1249
02:42:17,264 --> 02:42:19,198
They desecrated the temple of Apollo...

1250
02:42:19,734 --> 02:42:22,225
...and Apollo desecrated their flesh.

1251
02:42:22,403 --> 02:42:26,305
They thought they could come here
and sack our city in a day.

1252
02:42:26,474 --> 02:42:30,308
Now look at them,
fleeing across the Aegean.

1253
02:42:33,881 --> 02:42:35,644
What is this?

1254
02:42:35,816 --> 02:42:40,549
An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks
are praying for a safe return home.

1255
02:42:40,721 --> 02:42:43,588
I hope the sea god spits in their offering.

1256
02:42:43,758 --> 02:42:46,420
Lets them all drown
at the bottom of the sea.

1257
02:42:46,594 --> 02:42:50,462
This is a gift. We should take it
to the temple of Poseidon.

1258
02:42:51,532 --> 02:42:53,500
-I think we should burn it.
-Burn it?

1259
02:42:53,667 --> 02:42:55,498
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.

1260
02:42:55,803 --> 02:42:57,998
The prince is right.

1261
02:42:58,172 --> 02:43:01,733
I would burn the whole of Greece
if I had a big enough torch.

1262
02:43:01,909 --> 02:43:05,606
I warn you, good men,
be careful what you insult.

1263
02:43:06,213 --> 02:43:10,377
Our beloved Prince Hector
had sharp words for the gods...

1264
02:43:10,551 --> 02:43:13,645
...and a day later
Achilles' sword cut him down.

1265
02:43:13,821 --> 02:43:16,346
Father, burn it.

1266
02:43:17,158 --> 02:43:20,093
Forgive me, my king,
I mean no disrespect...

1267
02:43:20,261 --> 02:43:22,991
...but I don't want to see
any more sons of Troy...

1268
02:43:23,164 --> 02:43:25,689
...incur the gods' wrath.

1269
02:43:27,701 --> 02:43:31,432
I will not watch another son die.

1270
02:44:42,977 --> 02:44:44,501
Look at them.

1271
02:44:46,347 --> 02:44:48,781
You'd think their prince had never died.

1272
02:44:50,951 --> 02:44:53,044
You are their prince now.

1273
02:44:53,821 --> 02:44:55,846
Make your brother proud.

1274
02:50:48,442 --> 02:50:52,503
Let it burn! Let Troy burn!

1275
02:50:52,679 --> 02:50:57,207
Burn it! For Menelaus! Burn it!

1276
02:50:57,451 --> 02:51:02,286
Burn Troy! Burn Troy!

1277
02:51:02,456 --> 02:51:06,085
I promised you, brother!
I promised you!

1278
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:09,627
Burn it! Burn it for Menelaus!

1279
02:51:54,174 --> 02:51:55,971
Briseis. Where is she?

1280
02:51:56,143 --> 02:51:58,407
-Where?
-I don't know.

1281
02:51:58,578 --> 02:52:00,375
Please. I have a son.

1282
02:52:00,781 --> 02:52:03,249
Then get him out of Troy.

1283
02:52:09,823 --> 02:52:11,154
Briseis!

1284
02:52:15,329 --> 02:52:18,389
Paris! Andromache!

1285
02:52:19,833 --> 02:52:21,664
Helen. We must go.

1286
02:52:21,835 --> 02:52:23,826
-Where?
-I'll show you. Now. Hurry.

1287
02:52:24,004 --> 02:52:25,403
Paris. Paris.

1288
02:52:25,572 --> 02:52:28,302
It's a long way. Quick. We must go now.

1289
02:52:28,475 --> 02:52:30,067
Briseis!

1290
02:52:33,246 --> 02:52:35,043
Paris!

1291
02:52:41,755 --> 02:52:43,120
It's a long way. Quick.

1292
02:52:43,290 --> 02:52:45,588
Hurry. There's a tunnel.

1293
02:52:47,828 --> 02:52:49,386
-Come.
-I stay.

1294
02:52:49,563 --> 02:52:51,827
-No.
-My father will never abandon the city.

1295
02:52:51,999 --> 02:52:53,057
I can't leave him.

1296
02:52:53,266 --> 02:52:56,758
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.

1297
02:52:58,839 --> 02:53:00,807
-What's your name?
-Aeneas.

1298
02:53:00,974 --> 02:53:03,943
-Do you know how to use a sword?
-Yes.

1299
02:53:04,111 --> 02:53:06,079
The sword of Troy.

1300
02:53:06,246 --> 02:53:09,773
As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan,
our people have a future.

1301
02:53:09,950 --> 02:53:12,510
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.

1302
02:53:12,753 --> 02:53:15,153
-I will.
-Hurry. Quick.

1303
02:53:15,322 --> 02:53:17,722
Paris, Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.

1304
02:53:17,891 --> 02:53:19,381
I'll find her.

1305
02:53:21,828 --> 02:53:23,489
Go.

1306
02:53:24,331 --> 02:53:26,026
-I'll stay with you.
-Go.

1307
02:53:26,199 --> 02:53:27,393
Please don't leave me.

1308
02:53:27,567 --> 02:53:29,728
-How could you love me if I ran now?
-Please.

1309
02:53:29,903 --> 02:53:34,203
We will be together again, in this world
or the next. We will be together.

1310
02:53:40,981 --> 02:53:42,608
Go.

1311
02:53:46,219 --> 02:53:48,380
To the gate!

1312
02:53:48,688 --> 02:53:50,383
Forward!

1313
02:54:07,974 --> 02:54:09,498
Follow me!

1314
02:54:11,778 --> 02:54:13,109
Into line!

1315
02:54:15,115 --> 02:54:17,106
Soldiers of Troy...

1316
02:54:17,417 --> 02:54:19,681
...you men are warriors!

1317
02:54:19,853 --> 02:54:22,515
To lead you has been my honor!

1318
02:54:23,990 --> 02:54:25,548
My prince!

1319
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:29,228
The boatman waits for us.

1320
02:54:29,463 --> 02:54:33,832
I say we make him wait a little longer!

1321
02:54:56,289 --> 02:54:59,452
No one. Spare no one.

1322
02:55:09,903 --> 02:55:11,302
Paris!

1323
02:55:12,072 --> 02:55:14,040
Save yourself.

1324
02:55:44,771 --> 02:55:46,068
Briseis!

1325
02:56:09,029 --> 02:56:12,760
Beware, my friends.
I am a servant of the gods.

1326
02:56:37,724 --> 02:56:40,625
Have you no honor?

1327
02:56:40,794 --> 02:56:42,489
Have you no honor?

1328
02:56:56,610 --> 02:56:59,704
I wanted you alive, old man.

1329
02:57:00,146 --> 02:57:03,081
I wanted you to watch your city burn.

1330
02:57:05,018 --> 02:57:06,815
Please.

1331
02:57:08,188 --> 02:57:10,315
The children.

1332
02:57:12,659 --> 02:57:16,652
Spare the innocents.

1333
02:57:17,430 --> 02:57:19,295
Nobody's innocent.

1334
02:57:20,100 --> 02:57:21,897
Nobody.

1335
02:57:41,888 --> 02:57:44,413
Too late for prayer, priestess.

1336
02:57:53,667 --> 02:57:57,296
I almost lost this war
because of your little romance.

1337
02:57:58,772 --> 02:58:03,141
I want to taste what Achilles tasted.

1338
02:58:18,091 --> 02:58:22,528
You'll be my slave in Mycenae.

1339
02:58:22,696 --> 02:58:28,191
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.

1340
02:58:30,103 --> 02:58:31,434
And at night....

1341
02:58:45,051 --> 02:58:46,712
Get up!

1342
02:58:49,756 --> 02:58:51,621
Hold her.

1343
02:59:00,033 --> 02:59:01,364
Come with me.

1344
02:59:05,071 --> 02:59:06,595
No!

1345
02:59:14,147 --> 02:59:17,275
Paris!

1346
02:59:22,122 --> 02:59:23,646
No!

1347
02:59:23,823 --> 02:59:25,381
Don't!

1348
02:59:36,936 --> 02:59:39,871
Don't! Please!

1349
02:59:45,378 --> 02:59:47,744
Paris! Don't!

1350
03:00:20,647 --> 03:00:22,080
It's all right.

1351
03:00:23,016 --> 03:00:24,881
It's all right.

1352
03:00:48,007 --> 03:00:49,941
You gave me peace...

1353
03:00:51,778 --> 03:00:53,803
...in a lifetime of war.

1354
03:00:59,085 --> 03:01:00,416
Briseis, come.

1355
03:01:04,757 --> 03:01:06,019
-Go.
-No.

1356
03:01:06,192 --> 03:01:07,454
You must.

1357
03:01:07,627 --> 03:01:09,117
No.

1358
03:01:09,462 --> 03:01:11,123
Troy is falling.

1359
03:01:11,931 --> 03:01:14,331
-Go.
-No.

1360
03:01:14,501 --> 03:01:16,025
Begin anew.

1361
03:01:17,637 --> 03:01:20,868
We must go. I know a way out.

1362
03:01:27,680 --> 03:01:29,011
It's all right.

1363
03:01:31,518 --> 03:01:33,213
Go.

1364
03:01:40,894 --> 03:01:42,191
Go.

1365
03:03:22,395 --> 03:03:24,022
Find peace...

1366
03:03:24,998 --> 03:03:26,488
...my brother.

1367
03:04:37,370 --> 03:04:41,898
If they ever tell my story, let them say...

1368
03:04:42,075 --> 03:04:44,566
...I walked with giants.

1369
03:04:45,244 --> 03:04:48,702
Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...

1370
03:04:48,915 --> 03:04:51,475
...but these names will never die.

1371
03:04:53,419 --> 03:04:56,911
Let them say I lived
in the time of Hector...

1372
03:04:57,090 --> 03:04:59,354
...breaker of horses.

1373
03:04:59,759 --> 03:05:01,693
Let them say...

1374
03:05:01,861 --> 03:05:05,490
...I lived in the time of Achilles.
