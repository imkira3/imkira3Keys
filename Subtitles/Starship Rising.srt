1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,010
I've been told

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,680
to confess my sence before execution.

4
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,700
I'm John Worthy.

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,240
And I am just a fool who made a bad decision

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,740
at the wrong moment

7
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,700
and let a many more.

8
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,680
I never been wanna play by a rules

9
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,680
it's a...

10
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,290
it's not my style.

11
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,280
But in the Federation

12
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,290
that is a punishment will crime.

13
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,790
My father..

14
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,220
He was a kind man,

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,270
the strong voice.

16
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,940
I knew he was famous

17
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,590
and

18
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,710
I loved that people
will talk to him

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,870
but most of all

20
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,910
I lived in time we're spent along

21
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,380
way off the politics

22
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,290
We appose this ridiculous war

23
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,290
against the Terranostra

24
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,150
We demand

25
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,150
that the sovereign overseer

26
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,130
stop to provide funding for the war
and to help its own people.

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Puppet to the Federation

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,390
We ask you to think about ...

29
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,990
We were so close...

30
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,990
to life, to the different course.

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,990
I wanna to be him,

32
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,990
the private man

33
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,890
and not the street preaching
the god to much attention.

34
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,640
If I survive the fight for 5.3 minutes

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,430
I can take the exam.

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,980
One in a ten thousands chance.

37
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,560
The Federation flurished

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
and the people were censored.

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,850
My dreams grew in the silence.

40
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,850
Flight lieutenant, Chaplain.

41
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,850
Flight lieutenant, Worthy.

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,850
Worthy?

43
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,850
General,

44
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,160
did we know someone by the name of Worthy?

45
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,550
Yes, there was a dissident

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,790
I believe,

47
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,790
but he was assasinated.

48
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,900
Oh, yes.

49
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,670
Any relation?

50
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,670
No relation, Supreme Commander.

51
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,750
I see.

52
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,750
Flight lieutenant, Trapper.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,390
Flight lieutenant, Keechreech.

54
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,390
Pilots, generally last

55
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,460
3 minutes in combat. Jet fighters
cost the Federation

56
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,460
a 180.000 credits per year.

57
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,460
Should you crush and survive

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,460
you will never fly again.
I hope I make

59
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,510
myself clear.

60
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,690
One of this?

61
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,900
Over supplies. The ships inventory
had a few errors.

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,060
Is this legal?

63
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,110
Probably not.

64
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,180
Do you think our riches

65
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,540
should be just used for charity?

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,830
It's a... deepspace concetrates
It's should last about

67
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,440
6 months...

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,230
Federation property is not
to be used for library...

69
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,230
- No, captain.
- Anyway...

70
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,230
I got promoted, Flight lieutenant,

71
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,180
it will repay.

72
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,660
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes, no more misery.

73
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,180
Why did you join the Federation?

74
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,030
I want to fly.

75
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,850
You wanna fly?

76
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,850
Yes, Captain.

77
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,760
Fear, anger, glow fat
becomes a punishment.

78
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,030
The storm cloudes would gathering
and a new order would soon arise.

79
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,650
We found something on Gauda Prime.

80
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,230
DNA storage,

81
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,120
200.000 years old.

82
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Do you really believe we are decendents

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
from this horrible,horrible

84
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,360
creatures?

85
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,780
The masters?

86
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,310
Yes, the masters.

87
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,120
All the way to Gauda Prime
to prove your link to the gods!

88
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,930
I am a fucking god!

89
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,450
Of course you are, darling.

90
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,950
You are the king.

91
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,960
There is more.

92
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,700
It's a former DNA storage.

93
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,960
It has been abandoned.

94
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,770
Our history go back all the way.

95
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,770
I'll miss you when your gone.

96
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,430
I will.

97
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,260
Terranostra.

98
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,150
The dark medic nemesis of the Federation.

99
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,610
Ruled by the paleo religious high pope.

100
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,610
That all love to hate.

101
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,150
You could foresee
the cancer that was growing

102
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,920
within their rankings.

103
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,130
The new weapon of Tera from the despeakables
overseer end this evil Federation.

104
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,420
This is the prototype of the Star One class:

105
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,720
fastest, most viol dreadnought
in the Federation fleet.

106
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,340
Breaming with thousands of
the "holy anol" flee-meaning"* resources.

107
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,110
Each missile is capable of distinguishing life

108
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,110
on any "awound" 9 worlds.

109
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,880
I,the high pope of Teranostra...

110
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,960
- It's time.

111
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,460
declares a Holy war against
the Federation and the

112
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,460
so called "peacekeeping".

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,280
Stay with us, sister.

114
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
We're building an army.

115
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,160
We'll be fine!

116
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Will be ordinary form!

117
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,540
Earth,

118
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,280
a pat of radiation,

119
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,450
battle-scared,

120
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,450
the ghosts of our ancestors

121
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,450
still haunt it's hallowed lands.

122
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,240
General vessel stropping the subway!

123
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,970
Turn around!

124
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,760
Aye, captain!

125
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,840
All hands prepare for battle, shields at max!

126
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,250
No-no-no, not now!

127
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,750
Weapons control, charge batteries, target engines...

128
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,470
Weapons charge, giving a lock, captain!

129
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,470
What?

130
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,150
Fire!

131
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,100
2 max coming around, captain!

132
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,870
Captain, i recommended not engaging,

133
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,870
electroshields are not balanced!

134
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,590
Take them balanced!

135
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,010
Shields are gone, captain!

136
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,740
Already?

137
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,090
- If we gone with the shields
I recommended we wouldn't be in this position, captain.
- 2 more vessel!
- Taken away ...

138
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,880
Pilot, 28 thousand kilometers are come about.

139
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,600
Hold ranged communications are down!

140
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,610
By the missiles armed!

141
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,610
Just a minute!

142
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,610
"Clamber disarmed"...

143
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,610
I am in around!

144
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,380
Torgus, six seven deathful two eight by seven niner...

145
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,450
Aye, captain! Seven niner!

146
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,150
Fire!

147
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,180
No-no...

148
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,650
Well done!

149
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,440
You fucking deserved it!

150
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,440
Thanks.

151
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,550
We need to talk later.

152
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,850
About us?

153
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,080
So, is about us...

154
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,690
Us and the Federation.

155
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,820
Leave us!

156
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,110
How many holy men have you killed?

157
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,920
Sixteen.

158
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,210
All good servants in my kingdom.

159
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,180
I want you to do how-to game from the suprising.

160
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,390
Justice...

161
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,390
Remove you rope...

162
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,370
Fuck you!

163
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,680
Very well,

164
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,630
suffer in the violence!

165
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,180
Your execution will be your suffer.

166
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,180
We will rise!

167
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,470
Fucking rebellious cunt!

168
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,090
There is another fighter pilot onboard.
You would be in the brig.

169
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,610
Yes, captain! Lesson learned, captain!

170
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,970
Remember everyone,

171
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,120
you are mortal and
the service of the suffering...

172
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,930
You all vital part of the machine
known as the great Federation.

173
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,550
If one of us falters, we all falter.

174
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,510
Our first mission as prove Starship One

175
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,640
is to visit old Earth.

176
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,860
Stupid name for a planet.

177
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,130
Grace, shield!

178
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,430
New fusion shields activated.

179
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,700
Push on.

180
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,370
No.

181
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,860
All existing warboats ought to be
drafted into the Federation core.

182
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,380
One hundred percent taxation
we become slaves to the Federation.

183
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,670
And you say of this
with super weapons aiming us...

184
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,720
We manager little disagreement up there.

185
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,230
Your weapon has no shields, no communication...

186
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,510
Hey, sunshine, you don't realise that they will shoot upon this planet where we are still on it's surface.

187
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,710
Hey, sunshine, you don't realise that they will shoot upon this planet where we are still on it's surface.

188
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,460
Long range communications back online.

189
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,460
Get those jack-asses back up here.

190
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Yes, sir.

191
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,110
Patch me and the general Gustav.

192
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,480
I thought we were going after the Teranostra.

193
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,620
Do you really want to question me, general?

194
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,060
I know, but we should have a definitely...

195
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,140
Yes, appoint mother, all "dirty steep it" so much history that...

196
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,890
Following orders, supreme commander.

197
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,860
Good.

198
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,860
Dismissed.

199
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,700
You either place youself under Federation rule,

200
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:59,430
- or we...
 - ... and drink your artificial fruit juices all list of mind control and signes.

201
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,530
We gotta go. I am sorry.

202
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:09,250
Tell that civilian engineer that his life
is forfeit if he can not muchly to shields.

203
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,130
Yes, captain.

204
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,270
Landing team done.

205
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,480
We heading come about, ten thousands km's safe distance.

206
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,010
Arm "climaty two"!

207
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,290
I am not liking this job.

208
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,290
You two, on the bridge! Now!

209
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,820
Yeah, we know, we know.

210
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,840
Where are you go?

211
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,000
Missile bay. Now get out of my way, fucking grant...

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,710
- Hey!
- Fuck you, "joel-ball"!

213
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,670
Ask...

214
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,700
After you...

215
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,800
I've been an direct council
with the supreme commander,

216
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,310
Older assist to be a vaporized

217
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,870
under the charge of the
conspiring with a Teranostra

218
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,430
to supply them with class four warboats.

219
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,120
Do you understand the orders, captain?

220
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,240
Understood, general.

221
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,680
You negotiations failed.

222
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,680
They've launched two gunships.

223
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Rimmer, Rimmer!

224
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,850
"Climaty two", primed in ready.

225
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,420
Target.

226
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,330
Earth.

227
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,330
Should we should do that (?)*

228
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,170
Question me again, private Torgus!

229
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,380
Yes, captain!

230
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,890
Having trouble walking...

231
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,660
Well, get locked on!

232
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,250
"Motherfucker" (What the fuck?)

233
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,150
... that order!

234
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,400
Pull ..., Marta!

235
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,650
... back, Worthy!

236
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,010
This a fucking mutny?

237
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,970
Vessels approaching!

238
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,290
(...) Defence cannons are online.

239
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,550
Fire!

240
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,070
Fucking ...bitch!

241
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,900
Let's bring this bird down...

242
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,830
Starship "when a" high command, we are engage an a mutny suspect there Teranostra. (óä.)

243
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,830
We are not Teranostra!

244
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,550
Try go will around athmosphere the guns will be evacuate.

245
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,550
That's a stupid idea.

246
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,970
Do it. (óä.)

247
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,970
I fly .... shoot.

248
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,900
I got one.

249
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,170
Stay focused.

250
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,290
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

251
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,700
Rimmers gone!

252
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,860
I am with you.

253
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,330
Hope i am on the right side.

254
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,710
Get back to engineering.

255
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,080
Going down.

256
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,210
- Marta(???), get a cross-recall try to maneuvering trusters... (?)
 - I got Worthy.

257
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,810
- Non option!
- Drayson, what can you tell me?

258
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,090
We gonna crash!

259
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,110
Escape pods!

260
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,390
- "Upon a one scape pod left!"
- That's it.
- We a prototype.

261
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,640
The gas intake.

262
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,860
If we "bind" the gas through the engine intaken ... to slow ...

263
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,030
... blow a ship.

264
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,030
Not to speed the window blow from the intake.

265
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,490
Do it. Torgus, assist.

266
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,510
Could flanger mutny i love better.

267
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,600
...

268
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,250
...

269
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,790
...

270
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,790
... back to the freeze.

271
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,550
Drayson.

272
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,310
- It's working!
 - It's not working!

273
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,290
... on top, "brace rempact".

274
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,670
You fucking idiots!

275
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,650
I killed captain Savage.

276
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,800
She didn't deserve to die like a dog.

277
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,530
Without warning,

278
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,180
without a moment to reflect...

279
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,700
She was a great starship captain.

280
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,850
You ought to motivate people to war.

281
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,850
Give them a reason to fight.

282
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,710
Fee the manger.

283
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,510
Please no to order recieve, supreme commander, we need a compromation convoy.

284
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,510
Alpha three nine nine three tau.

285
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,280
Confirmed.

286
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,660
Shall never fly again.

287
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,460
Oh, she is at stay baby; shall fly.

288
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,710
After of he repair himself.

289
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,350
... build to better ship.

290
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,490
Those you Federation tax dollars hard of work.

291
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,390
It's batteries.

292
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,880
All Federation diplomats have been executed what is known as a Teranostra day of ...

293
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,630
It is estimated that at least ... women have been executed in an underground network.

294
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,770
The denied by the government civil war has erupted in the streets.

295
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,370
It is expected the Teranostra high council will make a formal declaration of war against the Federation

296
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,370
in the coming hours. The question is

297
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,290
where is the overseer and why is the government silent?

298
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,770
Missioneries, i needed now to bring repentance upon the population.

299
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,510
And well they have declared war

300
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,510
we have the first victory

301
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,510
with the Teranostra ground army.

302
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,410
Calisto two has fallen.

303
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,080
Missioneries, i needed now to bring repentance upon the population.

304
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,510
Follow ...

305
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,710
Set in retimers.

306
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,540
- I've... press release.
- How soon?
- Soon.

307
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,540
Now.

308
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,480
...

309
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,500
Why didn't you agreet me at the docking bay?

310
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,600
What is that?

311
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,050
Calisto two.

312
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,550
Oh, my God!

313
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,550
Your son!

314
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,930
And so many others.

315
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,380
I am truly sorry.

316
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,170
Teranostra agents of mutny at starship one.

317
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,020
Yes,

318
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,960
that's why i am here, general.

319
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,800
Courage ladies!

320
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,920
I never expected this.

321
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,380
We have word that the starship one has fallen in to revollianse.

322
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,510
Teranostra?

323
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,870
We don't know.

324
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,870
... contact two dollars.

325
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,240
You give us a name?

326
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,270
Which one of you is T'Bor?

327
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,640
She was be... yesterday.

328
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,130
We have five hundred and twenty eight legions ready for action and there is noone to lead them.

329
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,130
You know what Worthy ... missiles ... admire ... best starship.

330
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,960
No, we can allow missiles one of the blackmarket.

331
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,050
What a level the plane fill thing?

332
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,790
Level thing...

333
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,790
You ok?

334
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,390
Yeah, i just needed took my ...

335
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,750
You own them?

336
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,750
I got upgraded last week.

337
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,540

00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,450
Screen off.

509
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,740
... peacemakers.

510
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,790
To opening fire!

511
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,140
Do we fire back?

512
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,660
We have no shields.

513
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,930
Blast about the sky.

514
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:53,990
"More" power...

515
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,820
Fire!

516
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,870
Overheat... done.

517
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,340
Suggest we surrender!

518
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,170
Target again?

519
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,180
Turn tail and run.

520
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:22,660
What?

521
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,310
Pilot,

522
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,640
Drayson, can we call ...

523
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,440
Will to try.

524
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,120
Do it.

525
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,680
Are you serious?

526
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,360
Abort?

527
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,360
Destination?

528
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,710
Torgus, Worthy,

529
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,900
I am sending you a coded navigation link i have a private workshop at the out of west rim.

530
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,640
Want's up private anymore?

531
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,380
I am shielding it's exact location from your sensors.

532
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,510
It's like flying with the blindful.

533
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,440
In a direction where headed i would say it's ... prime.

534
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,150
General,

535
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,950
they sustain damage, we gonna soon their shields were down.

536
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,840
We split the fleet to follow.

537
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,620
To where?

538
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,980
Out west rim or maybe ... prime a Pol Maris.

539
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,340
Never heard of them.

540
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,800
That's way they headed.

541
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,800
Are you sure?

542
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,090
The darkness is closing.

543
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,090
Father,

544
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,660
i did what is right

545
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,590
and i was wrong.

546
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,420
What have i done?

547
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:45,800
Father!

548
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,490
Speak to me.

549
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:50,600
Speak!

550
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,210
Hit me!

551
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,490
No.

552
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,050
I thought you overseer prepayed

553
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,290
family members your mother personal dealings.

554
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:19,900
What the overseer doesn't see caught affect the overseer.

555
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,750
Besides,

556
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,000
besides...

557
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,820
who sent is was personal.

558
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,800
Hello, Master,

559
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,200
...

560
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,500
Forgives from the high office.

561
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,520
You are virgins, yes?

562
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,430
Yeah.

563
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:05,980
A virgins.

564
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,910
You know how to fly?

565
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,070
No.

566
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,800
I am Roartek.

567
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,170
Code 3-7-1-9-9-2.

568
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,170
Accepted.

569
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,670
Glad you safe.

570
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,040
View biomech.

571
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,050
My pleasure.

572
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,970
I can smell your machine oil.

573
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,160
I think you can trust her.

574
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,830
Do you have a female biomech?

575
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:09,280
It is a legal for me to create an entity that is more intelligent or powerful then myself.

576
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,160
But it does have it's advantages.

577
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,700
I am not prone to emotional violence or petty jealousies.

578
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,950
You don't like fly?

579
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,860
Making conversation.

580
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,620
I wanna tell you i can "spiriosy" theory about the high pope.

581
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,700
Seriously?

582
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,140
It's a really good one.

583
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:46,540
Ok.

584
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,990
... look on along way.

585
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,590
The air ... using. Are there any intelligence imitations?

586
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,910
I prefer not to discuss it.

587
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,570
We somewhere on a Pol Maris system, aren't we?

588
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,090
... large asteroids?

589
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,480
Nobody move!

590
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,230
General Gustav if you can ...

591
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,460
- 12 mm high power semiautomatic pistol.
 - No.

592
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,680
Staris!

593
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,220
I am fulfilling my wealth to the Federation.

594
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,650
You fucking traitor!

595
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,580
Send her back to Terminus.

596
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,790
Nasty fucker.

597
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,740
Fuck you

598
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,180
and your pathetic band of terrorists.

599
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Find her ... in a left tank compartment.

600
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:03,510
Goodbye.

601
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,000
Fairy good.

602
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,630
I need your opinion.

603
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,830
Yeah, it's one of our's.

604
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,320
Protocols been modified.

605
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,990
I found them ... around here few weeks ago.

606
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:40,910
Can i keep it?

607
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:43,790
I have two more.

608
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,980
... we can nervous.

609
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,900
What is that?

610
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,420
Nothing to concern your ...

611
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,550
I've never done a landing before.

612
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,370
You are nervous, are you?

613
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:06,970
I sure am.

614
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,150
Worse pilot i've ever seen.

615
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,210
I know what you can to say i am on it.

616
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,370
Whose orders are you ...

617
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,230
The general kindly gave up his codes for me.

618
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:29,670
I remember when you were baby i looked at on you you've been quite ... most ...

619
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,170
I could read you, your eyes revealed you sold me.

620
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,730
You can not hide anything from me.

621
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,170
As soon as you done return.

622
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:42,320
Understood.

623
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,090
My mechanical man of ... will be you looking for.

624
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,000
... confusion keep them all occupied for the petty wars.

625
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,000
Soon it will be ...

626
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,960
As soon as you start ... your hands return to Terminus.

627
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,000
I surprise you want peace after that landing.

628
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,650
This is Diana, i am Terina, hi.

629
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,500
They all ready for you.

630

Yeah, girls you can kick up your feet the bus is in the city i am business.

631
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,850
Sorta..

632
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,700
... has completed a scan.

633
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,700
The DNA is in this sector.

634
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,670
Be sure nothing is disturbed.

635
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,170
What is ... should remain that way.

636
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,310
Yes overseer, we understand.

637
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,820
Will my DNA control a work...

638
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,820
... test ...

639
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,110
Is ... evidence where they are.

640
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,590
Did they stay?

641
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,030
Maybe they just moved to another planet.

642
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,690
I've giving orders ... things ... to remain as they are.

643
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,380
Nothing ...

644
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,960
... very carefully.

645
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,320
Federation ... on those ridiculous electroshields.

646
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,900
... shields ...

647
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,900
...

648
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,300
Fuck you.

649
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,490
Set course for Earth.

650
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,140
We have an army ...

651
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,200
....

652
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,750
Videoencription is high.

653
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,400
Must be a secure ... keeping.

654
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,400
We know that ... for some DNA-decoder.

655
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,400
Should be easy enough.

656
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,200
... more complex ... simple ...

657
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,110
It's a twelve ... bytes.

658
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,090
I am going to create ... tracer.

659
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,820
... back to the source and we can see what they looking for.

660
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,050
Sounds like we arrived.

661
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,590
...

662
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,750
Total distruction every major city radiation bombs.

663
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,710
No.

664
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,210
I am sorry.

665
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,950
We and entire army in amounts waiting to be activated.

666
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,900
John Worthy?

667
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,490
You know me?

668
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,490
... galaxy knows you.

669
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:16,490
Yeah.

670
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:21,290
Diana is in charge of five hundred and twenty eight legions on Teranostra.

671
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,210
We taking charge of the warboats ... and paid for by the uprising.

672
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:28,390
I see.

673
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,460
... Federation ... Teranostra.

674
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,410
Where the hell you've been?

675
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,910
He is on Earth.

676
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,410
Why ... met ... intercept?

677
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,410
I know i have a plan relax.

678
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,590
Really, you have a plan?

679
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,130
I've a special ...

680
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,880
I am sick of fucking plans i need resolves.

681
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,560
Czarina, calm down everything is under control.

682
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,900
Don't touch me or i will have you shot.

683
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,270
Do you understand, Gustav?

684
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,330
...

685
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,330
You need to trust me.

686
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,340
The rest of fleets

687
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,840
"headed" to intercept.

688
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:46,460
Jolli?

689
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,950
I don't feel anything.

690
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,730
This is not my home anymore.

691
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,160
Let's make them suffer.

692
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,030
General, carrier* shuttle has arrived.

693
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,190
Good, you know what to do.

694
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,590
How many?

695
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,450
Thirty ships maybe more.

696
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:28,530
Arm the missile.

697
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,530
Incoming message.

698
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,220
Did he see the answer it?

699
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,720
Oh, no, i just figure ...

700
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,160
General,

701
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:37,610
Flight lieutenant,

702
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,750
It's captain.

703
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:39,720
Bring them over.

704
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,130
What the hell you ...

705
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,130
Your mother and sister will die.

706
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:47,230
One by one unless you surrender the starship.

707
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,560
Surrender there is no more time for discussion.

708
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,060
Nice work, general.

709
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,010
How do you do the exchange?

710
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,640
Surrender and your family will be released.

711
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,020
And you will be take into ...

712
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,670
My conditions ...

713
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,610
Fuck you.

714
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,330
No.

715
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:17,980
No.

716
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,370
Back to ...

717
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,180
How does it feel Teranostra scum?

718
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,590
How does it feel?

719
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,110
Cygnus alpha neutral zone.

720
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,140
Need there for the exchange.

721
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,140
One ship only.

722
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,670
Any games and we start blasting every Federation world we come across.

723
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,410
We are in neutral zone.

724
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,580
Jolli says that ah... Cygnus alpha.

725
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:13,810
So...

726
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,020
one ... electrical conductor.

727
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,900
Parently we use plasma guns ...

728
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:20,600
it's bad news.

729
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,270
She wants to try

730
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,270
use her antique weapons.

731
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:30,300
...

732
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,880
try the old bang-bang.

733
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,260
No.

734
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,450
You stay with the ship.

735
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,450
If we need you.

736
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:46,100
John,

737
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,180

738
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,480

739
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:52,810
You know...

740
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:53,380
Don't.

741
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:57,560
...

742
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,250
...

743
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,530
My grandmother

744
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,510
was gun down my friendlyfire ...

745
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,890
We all

746
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,010

747
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,690
I must to say goodbye ...

748
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,990
She never woke up.

749
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,420
Not now, Torgus.

750
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,230
Please.

751
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,660
I know.

752
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:40,540
I know.

753
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,060
"You can a hold all in".

754
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,760
...

755
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,040
And then boom.

756
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,230
You ... explode.

757
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,990
... gonna be the only one taken down by it.

758
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:58,640
..

759
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,140
Really.

760
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,980
... all with you.

761
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,880
... our lifes ... personal vendetta.

762
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:10,990
I know, i know.

763
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,660
It's ok.

764
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,260
She is dead.

765
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,130
It is my fault.

766
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,430
I was to busy you playing the hero.

767
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,500
To really care about those ...

768
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,840
...

769
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,320
General Gustav

770
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,420
is playing you.

771
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,120
Yes.

772
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,230
But i know

773
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,350

774
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,560
i gotta focus.

775
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:25,560
Yeah, you do.

776
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,770
... die out here.

777
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,170
It's cold.

778
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,840
...

779
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,100
Promise.

780
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:57,960
Right.

781
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,260
We have "one of" guns we want be needing your knife collection.

782
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,840
Guns are the weapons of cowards.

783
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,600
Will see.

784
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,050
Make sure ... safety protocols turned off.

785
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,870
... gunstock.

786
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:08,770
The DNA codes* ...

787
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,250
Tiberius,

788
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:13,170
you have been a good friend,

789
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,050
but i don't trust you.

790
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,780
Rise up.

791
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,320
Tiberius,

792
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:34,950
Yes, overseer.

793
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,760
Throw yourself of the ridge.

794
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,780
Yes, overseer.

795
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:54,230
Good.

796
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,890
Told you it works.

797
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:01,110
...

798
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:01,840
I can believe

799
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,870
... on this fuck ... planet.

800
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:14,250
A legions are ready just give the word.

801
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,220
The word is given.

802
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,300
Each of you will take a platoon and ... own church sector.

803
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:29,180
A twenty three hundred hours we strike.

804
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:33,740
Stay away from the front lines that is the territory of the "class 4-th".

805
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,170
We fight along side you until every last Teranostra male is dead.

806
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,900
Worthy sending a trap.

807
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:47,580
Where is starship?

808
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,580
Could be right on Earth ...

809
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,230
I don't like this.

810
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:01,710
We use this planet for testing ... warboats.

811
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,210
...

812
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:04,000
I see them.

813
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,310
Come on ...

814
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,310
Get ready the sidekick.

815

...

817
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,030
I am ashamed we served under the same flag,

818
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:33,310
teranostra scum.

819
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,980
I am not Teranostra.

820
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,260

823
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,740
Hold your fire, hold your fire!

824
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:07,540
Starship!

825
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,050
Don't move a muscle.

826
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,980
- Starship!
- Don't do it, don't do it!

827
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,260

I am gonna hunt you!

832
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,160
I am gonna kill you!

833
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,750
Get off, Jolli!

834

Never should i've doning like that.

835

836

Hold on, hold on.

837

...

838
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,970
Pick up needed at meeting point.

839
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,510
Dammit!*

... men.

842

Oh, fuck, it's a home guard.

843
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,150
...

844
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,540
Anya, ... to the west activated ... cells.

845
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,730
Go, go, go ...

01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,780

... stop the getting weapons lock.

852

01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,170
... bombardment ... clear.

857
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,230
General, we can get luff on this distance.

858
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,930
... circle in ...

859
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:06,700
Yes, sir.

860
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,700
Circle in, fire at will.

861
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,880
Yes, sir.

862
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:17,760
... super luminal.

863
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,080
Not at this altitude!

864
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,530
We heading for the 'aida' storm!

865
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,230
Perfect!

866
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:22,040
Are you mad?

867
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,430
Yes i am.

868
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,830
Fight with the ... don't fight the wind.

869
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:36,630
Bad idea.

870
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:37,630
Trust me.

871
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,380
... do this on a top fighter not under 'stormship'.

872
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,650
... kpsi.

873
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:50,150
Stay with him he is emotional will make mistakes.

874
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,450
Yes, general.

875
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:56,280
Too fast!

876
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,230
Quit the storm!

877
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:59,640
You are fool Worthy, this is not ...

878
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:01,820
Open fire!

879
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:09,880
Feel you ...

880
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:12,350
We gonna blow!

881
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:15,440
Faster!

882
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:15,860
No!

883
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:16,770
We can do it.

884
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:18,380
Pulling up twenty degrees.

885
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,380
Losing level trusters.

886
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:23,940
All right, all right!

887
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,770
Pull out!

888
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:27,770
... out here, pilot!

889
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,040
Dammit!

890
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,720
When we ... twenty eight thousand pull up.

891
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,490
... to reach escape velocity.

892
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:45,490
Really, it's a stupid idea.

893
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:11,500
It's working!

894
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,450
- ...
 - ... congratulations ...

895
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:15,750
...

896
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,340
Bring it on.

897
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,980
We all be going super luminal any time soon.

898
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,080
What are they?

899
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,400
Artificial grumpy field generators relock to the fucking gravity key.

900
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,510
... in the palace! Focus on the home guard.

901
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:40,320
Do not ...

902
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:42,690
Let's go.

903
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,330
Ok, ok, ok.

904
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,420
Drayson, what's the heat waiting after shields.

905
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:05,960
Seven thousand degrees Kelvin.

906
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,340
And the Federation ships?

907
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,800
Maybe three thousand but the command ship is six.

908
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,110
What's a hit range of a 'clamity'-missile.

909
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:12,210
Got it, i know ...

910
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:12,820
What is it?

911
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,720
Six to fifteen thousand.

912
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,230
If we ride on a very ...

913
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:16,700
Correct.

914
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,830
No, will die.

915
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:18,390
Do it.

916
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:19,490
Yes, captain.

917
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:20,850
Yes, captain.

918
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,130
Coming about

919
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:25,740
on a missile.

920
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,750
Already arm.

921
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:27,510
Launch.

922
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:30,260
- ...
 - I don't know.

923
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,440
How long?

924
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,170
Thirty seconds.

925
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,710
...

926
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,540
Circle around ... first blastwave ... between them.

927
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,490
Shockwave.

928
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:45,600
Only shit.

929
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,020
...

930
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:59,380
Nice knowing you.

931
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,680
Drayson, cut the power.

932
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:16,750
...

933
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,310
...

934
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:21,020
I need more warboats running distruction at the east gate.

935
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,240
So, Diana ... her team inside.

936
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,850
... years.

937
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:38,210
Feeling old?

938
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:39,710
Somedays.

939
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:40,770
Right.

940
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,250
Manual restart.

941
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:46,280
Ok ... ah ...

942
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:48,830
super luminal offline,

943
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:50,830
maneuvering trusters are gone,

944
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,830
weapons are offline.

945
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,650
Well, the good news ... still works.

946
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:57,650
So, basically ... drift.

947
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:00,020
Could be worse.

948
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:00,490
Really.

949
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:01,600
Captain.

950
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,100
Keep moving.

951
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,730
Section eight to the west wing.

952
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,580
Section seven!

953
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,620
Diana,

954
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,720
your wing coming. Get out!

955
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,720
Get out!

956
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,640
...

957
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,980
They sustain a lot a damage.

958
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:20,820
Guns.

959
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:25,000
Deck three and four... question ... order abandon ship.

960
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,970
Denied.

961
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,510
Reactor the critical.

962
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,080
Keep fire.

963
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,240
Our fat.

964
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:40,490
Keep moving.

965
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,490
Left corridor.

966
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:44,180
...

967
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:47,190
...

968
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:50,180
- Where is fucking probe?
 - ... off world.

969
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:52,420
Of course, yes.

970
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,340
Drayson,

971
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,470
any ... would be good.

972
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:56,820
Rerounding lifesupport.

973
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:58,230
Trusters online.

974
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:59,450
Run x-speed.

975
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:01,450
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

976
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,370
...

977
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:12,520
...

978
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,480
Fuck.

979
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,330
...

980
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,920
...

981
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,850
...

982
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:48,700
Where the lights?

983
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,210
Give me the lights.

984
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:51,900
...

985
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,900
Got it.

986
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,900
- ...
 - Where?

987
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,570
Where?

988
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:56,650
Where the 'breeders'?

989
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:57,980
...

990
01:13:58,990 --> 01:13:59,980
Here.

991
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,940
Oh my god!

992
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:07,780
Drayson!

993
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:10,140
No, no, no ...

994
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,510
We don't have time.

995
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:13,560
... Jolli.

996
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,260
It's my fault, no, no ...

997
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:16,810
no ...

998
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:20,610
We gotta go, we gotta go now!

999
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:23,360
Torgus, Torgus come on!

1000
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:29,000
Torgus,

1001
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,280
i need you to ... 'clamity-missile' ... fifteen minuts.

1002
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,920
Just do it.

1003
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,360
The fucking light.

1004
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:40,930
We can all ... in jet fighter i've got other ship to 'steel' and escape pod.

1005
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:43,090
Hey, you said fifteen minuts, right?

1006
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,180
...

1007
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,100
Keep this safe.

1008
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:01,640
... we get a "clamity-missile" here ...

1009
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,900
Hey, come on guys ...

1010
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:06,840
...

1011
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,270
...

1012
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,270
...

1013
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,440
Go-go, come on.

1014
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,020
Go.

1015
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,530
Come on, let's move, let's move!

1016
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,730
The fleet ... coming in ... he's not gonna make it.

1017
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,010
He's got five minuts.

1018
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,610
We need to get hell out of here.

1019
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:49,030
Abandon ship, lifesupport systems have failed.

1020
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:52,880
Abandon ship, lifesupport systems have failed.

1021
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:50,690
- Hey ...
- Where is general Gustav?

1022
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:51,380
Far they.

1023
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:53,380
I ... ah ...

1024
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,910
You want kill me?

1025
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,550
...

1026
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,100
He's headed to 'exit' of the escape path level two.

1027
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,750
Get out of ship ...

1028
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,670
Go!

1029
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:03,210
Go in.

1030
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:16,920

Why?

1057
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,760
...

1058
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,640
Federation, everybody,

1059
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,990
your world.

1060
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,530
You 'shot'.

1061
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,700
Federation rescue ships.

1062
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:11,390
because you ...

1063
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:42,350
We have John Worthy in Cassidy set course for Terminus.

1064
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:45,540
Roger that, sweeping more survivers.

1065
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:47,540
... executor for sure.

1066
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,030
believe.

1067
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,110
I have patrol.

1068
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,480
'linecer' open.

1069
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,600
The galaxy is listening.

1070
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:09,600
Confess.

1071
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:10,560
Do it.

1072
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:13,470
I am Detritus,

1073
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:15,410
bishop of the Teranostra.

1074
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,400
... have wife and children.

1075
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,010
We have

1076
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:25,080
surrender what is left for military

1077
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,000
to

1078
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:28,000
resistance.

1079
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Say it.

1080
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:35,320
A high pope of the Teranostra

1081
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,150
and the sovereign Federation overseer

1082
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:41,030
are one and the same person.

1083
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,810
Teranostra has fallen.

1084
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:53,930
Citizens of a federating worlds, you are fighting each other for no reason.

1085
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:02,040
A high pope of the Teranostra

1086
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,850
and the Federation sovereign overseer

1087
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:07,560
are one and the same person.

1088
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:10,280
...

1089
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:13,630
It's just politics.

1090
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,830
How do we rescue Worthy?

1091
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:19,670
He'll be is here by morning, all right?

1092
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:26,550
... to Terminus ...

1093
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,430
Let's get away from here.

1094
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,480
Overseer, we have the ... generator activated.

1095
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:58,190
'Partical' delivery tanks 'are full of primed'.

1096
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:00,190
Delivery system stand by.

1097
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:02,080
Work to get so long.

1098
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,680
We have problems ... alien DNA to the delivery modifiers.

1099
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,760
The DNA-'clo' will be capable ... all planetary world suitable.

1100
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,080
.. boats are ... when we primed and ready.

1101
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:13,770
Good.

1102
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:16,670
... been going on, i've been waiting you several hours.

1103
01:23:16,670 --> 01:23:18,670
Come here and sit down Seethus.

1104
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:29,420
I ado you, but you have to listen and listen well.

1105
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:35,180
The overseer is on his wayback right now and we have to act we have to do smth. right now.

1106
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:37,030
Does he found what he's looking for?

1107
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:39,030
Oh, Seethus.

1108
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,590
Have you ever

1109
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:45,250
suspected anything?

1110
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,860
The overseer is my half-brother.

1111
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:04,820
When i was fifteen he had his way with me.

1112
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:10,540
He doesn't remember it because he was elevated been 'joceling' stupid he don't remembering thing.

1113
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:15,920
But i was young and i told him that it was a teranostra

1114
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,760
ambassador would actually raped me.

1115
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:23,360
But he did not forgive.

1116
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:29,460
And he can never ever know

1117
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:32,270
because this is all my fault.

1118
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:34,270
Listen to me.

1119
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:40,590
Thrown of the sovereign overseer is ... yours.

1120
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,440
It's yours.

1121
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,830
You raped me.

1122
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:48,570
It's yours.

1123
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,000
He is my father.

1124
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:46,820
... enemy ...

1125
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,920
My mother and sister are alive.

1126
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:54,470
The general was a smart but just man. He played me like a deck of cards.

1127
01:25:54,880 --> 01:26:00,210
But now i see the overseer and it's family and the true enemies.

1128
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:02,150
We must forgive each other

1129
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:07,490
an ourselves, an all our sins and focus 'i hatred' on those who deserve it.

1130
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:12,790
The overseer must die.

1131
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:19,210
A high pope of the Teranostra and
the Federation sovereign overseer

1132
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,380
are one and the same person.

1133
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:23,820
It's true?

1134
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:25,820
I am sure your mother knows.

1135
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,320
How bombings in Kalisto, too?

1136
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:32,570
I hope you are
giving orders.

1137
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:37,640
I see.

1138
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:41,470
Keep me informed.

1139
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:57,960
So you here to carry out the execution order?

1140
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,540
It seems you're right.
- Yes

1141
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:07,490
I am getting you out of here.

1142
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,790
We have a war to fight,

1143
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:11,960
friend.

1144
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,610
The teranostra fallen.

1145
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:39,080
And a Federation not far behind.

1146
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:44,730
Valley that I use.
Will be my curse.

1147
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,610
And also there is hope.

1148
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,180
Love gone's way

1149
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,160
