00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,485
<i>Before they died, my parents told me
stories of how the world once was.</i>

3
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,767
<i>What it was like long before I was born.</i>

4
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,842
<i>Before the war with the machines.</i>

5
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,323
<i>They remembered a green world,</i>

6
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,164
<i>vast and beautiful.</i>

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,844
<i>Filled with laughter</i>

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,649
<i>and hope for the future.</i>

9
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,848
<i>But it's a world I never knew.</i>

10
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,048
<i>By the time I was born,
all this was gone.</i>

11
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,691
<i>Skynet,</i>

12
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,001
<i>a computer program designed to
automate missile defense.</i>

13
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,890
<i>It was supposed to protect us,
but that's not what happened.</i>

14
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,882
<i>On August 29, 1997,</i>

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,009
<i>Skynet woke up.</i>

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,681
<i>It decided all humanity
was a threat to its existence.</i>

17
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,085
<i>It used our own bombs against us.</i>

18
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,924
<i>Three billion people died
in the nuclear fire.</i>

19
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,923
<i>Survivors called it Judgment Day.</i>

20
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,131
<i>People lived like rats in the shadows.</i>

21
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,090
<i>Hiding, starving or, worse,</i>

22
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,444
<i>captured and put into camps
for extermination.</i>

23
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,608
<i>I was born after Judgment Day,</i>

24
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,124
<i>into a broken world</i>

25
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,850
<i>ruled by the machines.</i>

26
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,321
<i>The worst were infiltration units
designed to pass for human.</i>

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,162
<i>We called them terminators.</i>

28
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,126
It's okay, boy.

29
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,966
Good boy.

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,411
Are there others down here?

31
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,883
<i>And then one man found me.</i>

32
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,201
<i>His name</i>

33
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,722
<i>is John Connor.</i>

34
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,528
<i>And he changed everything.</i>

35
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,369
<i>John showed us how to fight back.</i>

36
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,445
<i>How to rise up.</i>

37
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,323
<i>He freed prisoners.</i>

38
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,080
<i>Taught us how to
smash the machines to scrap.</i>

39
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,929
<i>People whisper about John,</i>

40
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,846
<i>wonder how he can
know the things he does.</i>

41
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,401
<i>They use words like "prophet."</i>

42
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,325
<i>But John is more.</i>

43
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,769
<i>We're here because tonight,</i>

44
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,407
<i>he's going to lead us to crush Skynet.</i>

45
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,366
<i>For good.</i>

46
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,241
Sir? Request to join
the Colorado offensive.

47
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,365
I need you with me, Reese.

48
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,961
We're talking about
the complete destruction of Skynet, sir.

49
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,523
The Colorado unit will succeed.
The machines will fall tonight.

50
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,324
But right here, the Los Angeles assault
is just as important, maybe more.

51
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,920
More important than destroying
the Skynet's central core?

52
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,325
John, I don't understand why you're
leading an attack on a work camp.

53
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,090
Because the camp is a camouflage.

54
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,450
<i>Inside the camp is a hangar.</i>

55
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,649
<i>Beneath that hangar
Skynet has hidden its final weapon.</i>

56
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,404
<i>When Skynet realizes it has lost,</i>

57
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,166
<i>it will deploy that weapon
to ensure its own survival.</i>

58
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,042
We take it tonight,
or there is no tomorrow.

59
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,846
Then we'll take it.

60
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,327
You're my right hand, Reese,
and I've never thanked you for it.

61
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,680
You don't need to.

62
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,162
You gave us all a future, John.

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,331
I'm gonna use mine.

64
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,088
When this is all over,

65
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,248
I'm gonna find my parents' house.

66
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,044
Rebuild it.

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,606
Use my hands for
something other than killing.

68
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,326
How about you?

69
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,848
A cold beer would be good.

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,525
- That's some pretty big plans.
- Yeah.

71
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,609
Yeah, I guess
I don't think about it too much.

72
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,051
I can see that.

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,168
Well, I figure, whatever happens,

74
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,084
it's got to be better than this.

75
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,682
So many of us have died to get here.

76
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,841
I want you to know, Kyle, if there was
another way, I would have taken it.

77
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,520
We're moving out.

78
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,562
<i>The machine thinks</i>

79
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,562
<i>that we cannot win!</i>

80
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,571
<i>The machine thinks that we will not</i>

81
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,890
<i>strike at the very heart of Skynet!</i>

82
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,282
Yet, here we stand

83
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,404
on the precipice of the final battle.

84
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,764
<i>If we die tonight,</i>

85
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,408
<i>mankind dies with us.</i>

86
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,321
Now!

87
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,766
I look at each of you,

88
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,965
and I see the marks
of this long and terrible war.

89
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,651
Go! Go!

90
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,249
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

91
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,045
<i>Activate model 101.</i>

92
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,844
For our children,

93
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,890
our children's children,
so they will not carry these marks.

94
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,927
<i>But they will know who we are</i>

95
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,930
<i>and what we did.</i>

96
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,648
<i>That we did not bow down!
We did not give in!</i>

97
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,646
We rose up, at this moment,

98
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,810
<i>at this hour,</i>

99
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,448
<i>willing to sacrifice everything</i>

100
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,764
<i>so that they can live in freedom!</i>

101
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,130
<i>On this night,</i>

102
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,482
we take back our world!

103
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,684
They're using the weapon!

104
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,691
We've got to get to the hangar.

105
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,640
John!

106
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,530
John!

107
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,522
You want me, I'm right here!

108
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,044
<i>Colorado unit's reporting in.</i>

109
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,889
<i>Skynet's central core is down.</i>

110
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,011
<i>Repeat, Skynet has been destroyed.</i>

111
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,880
<i>John was right.</i>

112
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,528
<i>The Colorado unit succeeded,</i>

113
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,963
<i>and the machines fell.</i>

114
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,846
<i>But it was too late.</i>

115
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,366
<i>We found it, sir,</i>

116
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,564
right where you said it would be.

117
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,570
What is that thing?

118
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,560
Fate.

119
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,043
It's the first tactical time weapon.
Skynet just used it.

120
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,091
What the hell?

121
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,808
We'll need 15 minutes
to ready the machine, sir.

122
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,963
We're running coordinates,
we should have them for you momentarily.

123
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,168
Los Angeles, 1984.

124
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,043
Los Angeles, May 12,

125
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,011
1984.

126
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,530
Skynet knew it was losing,
so it tried to rig the game.

127
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,884
It sent a terminator
back to the time before the war.

128
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,565
And who's the target?

129
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,361
My mother.

130
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,166
Sarah Connor.

131
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,531
If the machine succeeds,
I'll never be born.

132
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,770
They'll kill her first.

133
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,204
And by doing so, erase every victory
we've fought for, including tonight's.

134
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,244
There won't be a resistance
to challenge the machines.

135
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,201
With this one act, Skynet will win.

136
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,005
We can use the technology ourselves,
send someone back.

137
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,246
We don't even know if that'll work.

138
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,811
- I'll go!
- I'll go, sir!

139
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,200
- Right here.
- I'll go!

140
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,401
I'll go!

141
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,160
I'll volunteer!

142
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,480
I'll go back.

143
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,730
Why should I send you

144
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,411
over all of them?

145
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,445
Because I'd die for Sarah Connor.

146
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,730
All these people
would die for Sarah Connor.

147
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,568
What makes you any different?

148
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,045
You know why.

149
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,123
Everything you've told me about her.
I know her, John.

150
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,451
Let me save her.

151
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,600
No weapons?

152
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,121
We've measured the magnetic field,

153
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,608
it'll rip apart anything
not encased in living tissue.

154
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,602
Think tinfoil in a microwave
times a few billion,

155
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,370
nothing left but a crater.

156
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,964
No clothes, either.

157
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,609
She's going to think I'm crazy.

158
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,804
You knew the device would be here.

159
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,284
You knew when it'd be set for.

160
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,482
You knew the machines
would fall tonight.

161
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,928
Just before I go, tell me...

162
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,446
Tell you what?

163
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,609
Do you see the future?

164
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,604
No one can see the future, Reese.

165
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,649
Okay, then how do you know?

166
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,971
I cheat.

167
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,007
Sarah told me so much.
Gave me signposts.

168
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,251
When I was a kid,

169
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,124
it seemed like
my mother knew everything.

170
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,720
That must've been great.

171
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,171
Not really.

172
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,040
It stops here.

173
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,246
Once you go back, my knowledge ends.

174
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,005
That's as much as Sarah knew.

175
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,085
So no more cheating.

176
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,244
No more cheating.

177
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,140
The time you're going back to,

178
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,403
she won't be the warrior
that raised me, not yet.

179
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,843
She'll be scared and weak.

180
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,928
She won't know how to fight
or defend herself.

181
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,731
Her biggest worry
is making rent and tuition.

182
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,047
She's a waitress.

183
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,321
A what?

184
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,811
A...

185
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,600
Never mind.

186
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,727
Just be ready for the fact that she
will need you, but she won't know it.

187
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,367
Okay, so what do I say to her?

188
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,448
Even when I tell her who I am,
she's not gonna believe me.

189
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,090
<i>Tell her this...</i>

190
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,361
<i>Thank you, Sarah, for your courage
during the dark years.</i>

191
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,521
<i>I can't help you with
what you must soon face,</i>

192
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,120
<i>except to say the future is not set.</i>

193
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,808
<i>There is no fate
but that which we make for ourselves.</i>

194
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,283
<i>You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.</i>

195
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,570
<i>You must survive,</i>

196
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,922
<i>or I will never exist.</i>

197
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,130
Take care of her for me, Kyle.

198
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,320
I will.

199
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,325
I promise you.

200
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,083
What you're doing right now,
this is the end of the war.

201
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,687
You didn't think
it would be that easy, did you?

202
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,881
John!

203
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,524
Hey, birthday boy!

204
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,769
Present time. Let's go!

205
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,245
No way!

206
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,444
Genisys will auto-update
as soon as it comes online.

207
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,728
You'll have it the moment it comes out.

208
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,248
Just a few days more.

209
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,566
A straight line.

210
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,565
Remember, Genisys is Skynet.

211
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,083
<i>When Genisys comes online,
Judgment Day begins.</i>

212
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,768
You can kill Skynet before it's born.

213
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,485
Hey, hey...

214
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,445
Hey...

215
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,441
Hey.

216
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,966
Hey, bud.

217
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,650
Did you just see a real bright light?

218
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,642
Hey!

219
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,170
It's my turn.

220
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,731
Hey, hey!

221
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,644
What's wrong with this picture?

222
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,848
Nice night for a walk, eh?

223
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,850
Nice night for a walk.

224
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,606
Wash day tomorrow. Nothing clean, right?

225
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,441
Nothing clean, right.

226
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,291
Hey, I think this guy's
a couple cans short of a six-pack.

227
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,604
Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

228
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,525
Hey, fuck you, asshole.

229
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,001
You won't be needing any clothes.

230
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,809
I've been waiting for you.

231
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,125
Hey! That son of a bitch
just stole my pants!

232
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,322
What day is it? What year?

233
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,808
May 12, 1984.

234
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,970
The day you arrive.

235
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,285
LAPD! Freeze!

236
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,962
All right, that freakin' hurt.

237
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,964
- Garber, you okay?
- You tell me, O'Brien.

238
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,362
You're human. Hey, you got to let me go.

239
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,290
Face down!
Hands on your back, or I will shoot!

240
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,441
Listen to me...

241
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,481
Hey!

242
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,650
It's coming, all right?

243
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,804
You need to listen to me,
or we're all going to die.

244
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,929
I had it under control.

245
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,248
Yeah, okay, T.J. Hooker.

246
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,321
Here's what you don't do
your first day on the beat.

247
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
Use lethal force on
the delusional homeless guy.

248
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,682
By the way, you're filling out
the paperwork on this.

249
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,165
Garber!

250
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,561
Shit.

251
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,649
That's got to be an alien,
like from outer space.

252
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,489
It's a machine that kills humans.

253
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,443
- Uncuff me!
- No! You're under arrest!

254
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,764
What part of "kills humans"
is confusing to you?

255
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,004
Handcuffs!

256
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,124
O'Brien. Officer down. We need backup.

257
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,531
It's a robot!

258
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,527
- We're screwed, aren't we?
- Pretty much.

259
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,570
Come with me if you want to live.

260
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,201
Now, soldier!

261
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,931
Reese, right?

262
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,931
Kyle Reese?

263
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,762
- You're Sarah.
- Yeah, I know that.

264
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,761
You hit your head back there?

265
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,162
The terminator. I don't know the model.

266
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,562
T-1000. Liquid metal. Shape-changer.

267
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,920
It just needs to touch something
to mimic it.

268
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,845
You know about terminators?
And you know who I am?

269
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,962
You were sent to protect me
by John Connor,

270
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,929
the leader of the Resistance.

271
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,281
My son.

272
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,249
I don't understand.
You can't know any of this.

273
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,600
But I do.

274
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,169
Listen to me, Reese,
everything's changed.

275
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,045
The 1984 John sent you to,
it no longer exists.

276
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,288
No, this is all wrong, all right?
John sent me here to save you.

277
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,283
From the terminator
that was sent back to kill me.

278
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,442
I know, but we already took care of him.

279
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,806
"We"?

280
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,881
Get down!

281
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,845
Reese, stop it!

282
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,606
Reese, God damn it!

283
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,960
- Stay here!
- Reese, wait!

284
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,685
Those bullets will kill him!

285
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,365
He's here to kill you!
Stay in the truck!

286
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,290
Great. That's just great.

287
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,163
I did not kill him.

288
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,321
We do not have long
before the T-1000 acquires our position.

289
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,324
Arguing with Kyle Reese
puts us at a strategic disadvantage.

290
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,526
Bite me.

291
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,166
That is a very immature response.

292
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,205
So you're the one
I've been waiting for all my life.

293
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,281
How is he?

294
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,890
Still breathing.

295
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,121
Good. Then you should be able to
mate with Kyle Reese in this timeline.

296
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,050
Okay, we're not having
this conversation again.

297
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,162
We know that your son
will be John Connor,

298
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,806
and that the machines
cannot be defeated without him.

299
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,206
I do not see a choice.

300
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,526
Story of my life.

301
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,564
Look, and it's not just mating.
I'm supposed to fall in love with him.

302
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,563
My files do not deal with love.

303
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,404
Shocker there.

304
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,886
You're being emotional.

305
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,800
This is my life. I wouldn't mind
being consulted once in a while

306
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,570
about how it's gonna go.

307
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,686
Remember, Genisys is Skynet.

308
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,090
<i>When Genisys comes online,
Judgment Day begins.</i>

309
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,086
<i>Go to San Francisco, 2017.</i>

310
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,763
You can kill Skynet before it's born.

311
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,481
Hey!

312
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,602
I need answers, all right. Right now.

313
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,051
How'd that liquid metal thing
know where to intercept me?

314
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,205
Where'd it come from?

315
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,281
And who the hell is this skin job?
What the hell is going on?

316
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,529
Sorry, we were a little busy with
the whole life-and-death combat thing.

317
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,802
And then you attacked Pops.

318
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,361
You named it?

319
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,961
Hello, Kyle Reese.

320
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,088
It is nice to meet you.

321
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,881
Are you kidding me?

322
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,442
I've been trying
to teach him to blend in.

323
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,650
I know it needs work.

324
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,322
It's a terminator! The only reason
it blends in is to kill humans.

325
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,130
Pops doesn't kill anyone.

326
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,730
A lot of leg wounds, though.

327
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,406
It looks old.

328
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,249
I've never seen a terminator old before.

329
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,807
The flesh they put on the cyborgs
is normal human tissue.

330
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,166
It ages.

331
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,204
My auditory circuits
have not degraded, however.

332
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,606
I'm old.

333
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,045
Not obsolete.

334
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,846
I think you hurt his feelings.

335
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,450
It doesn't have feelings!

336
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,484
He saved my life when I was nine.
He's the only reason I'm alive.

337
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,049
I was programmed to protect
Sarah Connor. I will not stop.

338
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,767
Yeah? Programmed by who?
Who sent him back?

339
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,484
Those files have been erased.

340
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,681
That's convenient.

341
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,410
Whoever sent him,
they don't want us to know.

342
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,363
Not me, not him, not anyone.

343
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,488
So Skynet can't target
the person who saved me.

344
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,524
Logically, it is someone
who wants Sarah Connor to live.

345
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,761
Old.

346
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,611
Not obsolete.

347
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,282
The T-1000 knows where we are.

348
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,444
Make yourself useful.

349
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,370
And don't shoot Pops.

350
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,085
This is insane.

351
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,170
All of it. This is not the mission.

352
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,090
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, Reese.

353
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,767
The girl that you came back for,
she's gone.

354
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,083
I don't need saving.

355
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,411
- There's a new mission.
- Yeah? Which is?

356
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,368
If the past can change,
then so can the future.

357
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,890
We can stop Judgment Day
from happening. Ever.

358
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,207
Kill Skynet before it's born.

359
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,080
What?

360
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,580
Get down!

361
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,081
- We have been reacquired.
- Yeah. No shit!

362
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,320
Get back!

363
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,047
Wait, why are we stopping?

364
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,162
Why are we... Hey!
We can't stay here, it'll find us.

365
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,009
That's the idea. Pops, get it open.

366
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,521
Give me a hand?

367
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,451
You said it happened
'cause the past was altered. How?

368
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,721
Does that matter?

369
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,531
How, Sarah?

370
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,043
A terminator was sent after me
when I was a kid, okay?

371
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,724
Terminators only come from one place,
the future.

372
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,805
Something happened.

373
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,411
Okay. So?

374
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,125
- I think I might have seen it.
- What...

375
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,410
What are you talking about?

376
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,808
When John sent me back, he was attacked.

377
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,569
By a terminator.

378
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,087
Did it kill him? Is John dead?

379
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,086
I don't know.

380
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,088
I saw it grab him, and then I was gone.

381
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,362
We have approximately 35 seconds.

382
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,521
Or less.

383
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,609
Sarah, go!

384
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,007
And I volunteered for this shit.

385
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,446
Sarah?

386
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,566
You got to help me.

387
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,086
I'm hurt.

388
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,567
Sarah?

389
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,566
Shit.

390
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,769
Hey, it's me, Sarah!

391
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,485
Sarah, he's lying.

392
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,041
Hey.

393
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,051
He's the machine. I'm Reese.

394
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,486
It's me, Sarah.

395
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,488
All right, listen, the terminator's
not dead. It attacked me!

396
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,085
Sarah, you said they could mimic.

397
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,368
- It's me, Sarah!
- He's mimicking. Shoot him!

398
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,323
I'm Reese! Shoot him!

399
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,604
Nice try.

400
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,007
Run!

401
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,803
How'd you know which one was him?

402
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,521
Well, I didn't know exactly.

403
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,405
You could have shot me!

404
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,200
Well, I was pretty sure it wasn't you.

405
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,846
Pretty sure?

406
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,811
We've been prepping for you
to arrive for over a decade.

407
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,206
That, too.

408
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,207
- So you set a trap.
- Had to.

409
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,087
Can't leave any future tech behind
when we go.

410
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,526
Go?

411
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,526
Go where?

412
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,730
That's...

413
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,724
A Time Displacement Device.

414
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,047
Yeah, well, it looks like
a piece of junk.

415
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,844
There's no governing
technology in this time

416
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,122
that can control
the displacement circuits.

417
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,403
You needed the CPU
from the future to make it run.

418
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,004
And you couldn't exactly use your own.

419
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,162
We get one trip only.
It's gonna fry the chip,

420
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,368
and take out most
of the L.A. city power grid.

421
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,241
Are we ready?

422
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,362
The coordinates are set for 1997.

423
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,449
You must leave as soon as possible.

424
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,730
We. We're going. All of us.

425
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,568
My flesh will take years to regrow.

426
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,810
I cannot come with you due
to the magnetics of the quantum field.

427
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,900
Pops!

428
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,889
You want us to time travel?

429
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,890
Into the future. In that?

430
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,286
Yeah, we can't be wearing anything.

431
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,965
Yeah, I know how time travel works.

432
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,088
- Sarah...
- Look, don't try and talk me out of it.

433
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,090
Look, I know you think you're here
so you can just lock me in a room

434
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,540
until I give birth to
the leader of the Resistance.

435
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,641
You're right.

436
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,804
But this... This is the only way
to stop Skynet for good.

437
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,046
I already said you're right.

438
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,291
Wait, what?

439
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,244
Not to '97.

440
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,610
2017.

441
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,208
Yeah, October 2017.

442
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,846
No, that's too late.
That's after Judgment Day.

443
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,241
No, you said everything's changed,
and you're right about that, too.

444
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,481
Sarah...

445
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,689
Look, I've seen a world
where the bombs never fell.

446
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,969
All right? The same house.

447
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,004
The same parents.

448
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,967
It was the same me, only I was...

449
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,525
I was home.

450
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,048
It was my 13th birthday.

451
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,846
A dream of having your family back
doesn't mean a thing.

452
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,001
Trust me.

453
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,362
Not a dream, all right? A memory.

454
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,005
I can't hold on to all of it, just moments,
but I was given a message.

455
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,488
"You can kill Skynet before it's born."

456
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,160
"Skynet is Genisys."

457
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,001
It comes online October 2017.

458
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,727
And when it does, Judgment Day happens.

459
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,006
So you're remembering the future?

460
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,167
No.

461
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,171
The boy is the alternate
timeline version of you.

462
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,167
Kyle Reese is remembering his own past,

463
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,884
which is our future.

464
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,849
That makes it so much better.

465
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,803
How can he be remembering two timelines?

466
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,407
It is possible
if he were exposed to a nexus point

467
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,086
in the timeflow
when you were in the quantum field.

468
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,688
Can you stop him talking like that?
Is there a switch or something?

469
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,086
Pops, try again.

470
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,005
A nexus point is an event
in time of such importance

471
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,731
that it gives rise
to a vastly different future.

472
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,242
After John was attacked,
when I was in the sphere,

473
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,561
that's when the memories began.

474
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,321
John!

475
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,208
If John Connor were to be
killed or compromised,

476
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,927
it could result in the ability
to remember both pasts.

477
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,251
Theoretically.

478
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,970
Or "theoretically" his brain is scrambled
from when you hit him on the head.

479
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,206
Sarah!

480
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,450
I don't know why I'm remembering
a life I never lived.

481
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,730
But I know it's real.

482
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,521
No.

483
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,089
We go to 1997.

484
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,602
Reese, put that back!

485
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,125
I can't let you do this.

486
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,450
I don't know you.

487
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,641
But that is my one bullet
to fire at the heart of Skynet.

488
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,804
Give the chip back.

489
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,284
You have to trust me.

490
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,721
No. I don't.

491
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,164
You can do this.

492
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,604
A straight line.

493
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,651
You just go, and you don't look back.

494
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,810
Where did you hear that?

495
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,161
In a past I shouldn't remember.

496
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,680
But I do.

497
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,889
If we go to 2017, then what?

498
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,161
Skynet's a computer program.

499
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,011
As long as it's still being coded,
it's contained.

500
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,361
Once it's uploaded from the servers,

501
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,926
it can't be stopped.

502
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,691
We blow it the hell up.

503
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,724
Yeah. We blow it the hell up.

504
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,202
You think he's dead, don't you?

505
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,285
It doesn't matter what I think.

506
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,488
We do what John would,
keep going no matter what.

507
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,170
So we just pretend
like it never happened?

508
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,327
Well, it hasn't.

509
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,640
Not yet.

510
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,328
If we stop Skynet, it never will.

511
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,407
Trust me, all right?
If anyone could survive, John would.

512
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,731
Pops had all these files about
John the military leader, but...

513
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,564
What was he like?

514
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,327
The first moment I saw John,
he shot a terminator right in front of me.

515
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,923
I didn't even know they could be killed.

516
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,846
That was the first moment
in my life I felt hope.

517
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,685
After that, of course,
I followed him around like a stray dog.

518
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,280
And he taught me how to fight,
how to shoot.

519
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,130
Tried to show me
how to make moonshine once,

520
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,282
but that didn't exactly work out.

521
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,926
Moonshine?

522
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,125
Yeah. The still exploded,
and we burned our eyebrows right off.

523
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,290
Man, we laughed for days.

524
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,409
Sometimes I think
I'm the only person on the planet

525
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,807
that ever saw John Connor smile.

526
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,808
He used to tell me about you.

527
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,289
How strong you were, and how
you prepared him for what was coming

528
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,888
when no one thought the danger was real.

529
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,723
How there was no one else like you,

530
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,725
and never would be.

531
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,491
Look...

532
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,482
I know I'm not what you expected.

533
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,090
But I want you to know,

534
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,840
I will do whatever it takes
to keep you safe.

535
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,925
Even if it kills me.

536
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,283
Anyway, that's the kind of man
your son was.

537
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,206
Is.

538
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,771
Will be. Jesus.

539
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,283
Time travel makes my head hurt.

540
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,844
Alternate timelines are not complicated.

541
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,645
It's merely a matter
of tracking possible futures

542
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,780
using an exponential growth
and decay algorithm.

543
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,881
Right.

544
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,371
There is a switch, and I will find it.

545
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,964
I do not understand.

546
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,046
Why did you not
tell Kyle Reese the truth?

547
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,485
I will tell him. Just not yet, okay?

548
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,845
Did you mate?

549
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,965
Can you just not say the word "mate"
to me again, like, ever?

550
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,241
That is a meaningless gesture.

551
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,165
Why hold on to someone
when you know you must let them go?

552
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,090
What about you?

553
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,651
What will you do?

554
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,571
Take the long way.

555
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,730
Prepare for your arrival in 2017.

556
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,729
Kyle Reese, I've seen little to indicate

557
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,922
that you're a fit guardian
for Sarah Connor.

558
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,530
You know you're not her dad, right?

559
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,291
You both just really need to stop this.

560
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,728
Just make sure you show up.

561
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,127
I don't want to have to
steal someone's pants again.

562
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,402
I have the coordinates in San Francisco.

563
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,931
I'll be there.

564
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,929
What will it be like?

565
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,247
You mean if it doesn't kill us both?

566
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,606
It'll hurt.

567
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,610
Hey, hey, hey.

568
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,529
It's okay. I got you.

569
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,681
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right. I got you.

570
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,528
I got you. It's okay.

571
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,120
I got you.

572
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,450
Hey, asshole! Get off the road!

573
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,411
Bite me.

574
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,363
I told you we couldn't trust him.

575
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,289
He'll find us. I can count on him.

576
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,528
How does a 9-year-old
get her own terminator?

577
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,048
It's okay. You don't have to tell me.

578
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,808
It was back in 1973.

579
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,882
My parents had a cabin at Big Bear Lake.

580
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,726
Dad and I would always
go fishing in the morning.

581
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,883
Mom would wave to us from the dock.

582
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,128
And I was just looking at her in the...

583
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,729
And then the cabin exploded.

584
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,322
I thought the boat was sinking,
you know,

585
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,369
but it wasn't water
coming up from below,

586
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,086
it was liquid metal.

587
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,005
T-1000.

588
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,925
Dad told me to swim in a straight line,

589
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,571
tracing his finger across my palm.

590
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,842
"You can do this," he said.

591
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,408
"You go, and you don't look back."

592
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,925
His last words to me, and you...

593
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,530
You knew them.

594
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,166
How?

595
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,842
It's an impossible memory. I...

596
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,209
I just remembered

597
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,361
you taking my hand,
and then saying those words.

598
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,682
And I was just looking at you, thinking,

599
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,081
"She's... She's beautiful."

600
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,806
Sorry. I shouldn't have...

601
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,009
So your dad told you to go, and then...

602
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,326
<i>And then I jumped in and I swam.</i>

603
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,720
<i>I made it to the dock.</i>

604
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,690
<i>And I hid under it.</i>

605
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,603
<i>Pops found me.</i>

606
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,849
<i>And he pulled me from the water.</i>

607
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,203
<i>And he said that he would
never let anyone hurt me.</i>

608
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,369
<i>He's the only person
who has always been there.</i>

609
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,368
Except he's not a person.

610
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,561
All right? He's a human-shaped

611
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,484
thing that's been designed,
programmed to gain your trust.

612
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,285
Look, if Pops wanted me dead,
I'd be dead.

613
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,681
This is what they do, all right?

614
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,882
They infiltrate, they get close.

615
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,604
Your "Pops" could have directives
built in he doesn't even know about.

616
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,484
Just because you two don't get along...

617
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,046
It's not about getting along!
This is about keeping you alive.

618
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,130
Yeah, well, I was raised by a machine
to kill cyborgs

619
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,806
and survive the nuclear apocalypse.

620
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,561
I think I'm doing just fine, thanks.

621
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,045
<i>Two naked perps</i>

622
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,810
try to blow themselves up
on the freeway,

623
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,247
all they do is make
a really big pothole.

624
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,010
Thank God for incompetent terrorists.

625
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,360
Homeland's on their way.

626
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,960
Good. The sooner we dump
this on them, the better.

627
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,651
Who called Optimus Prime?

628
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,690
Lieutenant! Wait up!

629
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,009
Wait up! Did you see it? Did you?

630
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,091
Hey, look, I got some frame grabs
from the overpass.

631
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,481
See?

632
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,241
It...

633
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,924
It's not a bomb!

634
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,286
Listen. That...

635
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,970
That sphere...

636
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,129
They came out of it.

637
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,449
This is proof of what I've been
talking about for 30-whatever years.

638
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,642
Those two were in 1984.

639
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,481
They were there.

640
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,365
I need to see the suspects.

641
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,289
O'Brien, have you been drinking?

642
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,801
That's what I thought.

643
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,843
Look, we're just teeing this up
for Homeland.

644
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,850
Once they show up, this is their game.

645
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,281
For now, old drunks
with robot fixations ride the bench.

646
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,081
- You really don't want a local?
- I'm fine.

647
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,009
Just do what she wants, it's way easier.

648
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,205
Yeah. Yeah, I preordered
Genisys weeks ago.

649
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,169
Downloading the second
the counter hits zero.

650
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,250
No way I'm standing in line for it.

651
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,691
You know about Genisys?

652
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,922
How? What is it?
Where'd you hear about it?

653
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,405
I'll call you back.

654
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,371
Genisys is an operating system?
What does it do?

655
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,646
Genisys does everything.

656
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,889
My phone will link to my tablet
will link to my computer

657
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,001
will link to my car...

658
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,722
Everything in my life
uploaded and online 24/7.

659
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,006
Totally connected.

660
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,011
Connected to what?

661
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,847
Doctors! Excuse us, please.

662
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,205
You two have a lot to explain.

663
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,806
Starting with who you are.

664
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,769
Nobody in our database
matches your prints.

665
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,082
No facial recognition hits
for driver's license,

666
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,248
passport, social media accounts,
credit cards,

667
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,930
not even a goddamn student I.D.

668
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,969
- So?
- So that's impossible.

669
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,971
Somehow you've gone so far off the grid
that you don't even exist.

670
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,202
You, on the other hand,
we got a hit when we ran your prints.

671
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,080
Kyle Reese. But here's the thing.

672
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,089
Two months ago,
Kyle Reese was brought in

673
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,725
for fighting in a multiplex.

674
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,808
His parents flipped,
did the whole <i>"Scared Straight"</i> thing,

675
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,380
had him fingerprinted,
sat him in lockup...

676
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,481
Parents?

677
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,085
Yeah, parents.

678
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,881
Kyle Reese was born in 2004. He's 12.

679
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,086
Of course.

680
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,970
They're here. They're still alive.

681
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,408
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're not going
to I.D. you as their kid.

682
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,726
Except the prints match.

683
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,604
Right? It's because
he's the same person!

684
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,125
He hasn't aged.

685
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,204
Not a bit since I saw him in 1984.

686
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,651
Her, too.

687
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,685
You remember me?

688
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,248
I was younger.

689
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,330
More hair, less...

690
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,125
You saved my life.

691
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,768
I was a uniform cop in L.A.

692
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,447
Who are you people?

693
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,368
Sergeant. Tech-Com.

694
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,165
DN38416, Kyle Reese.
You need to let us go.

695
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,260
Reese, don't.

696
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,203
Soldier. Me, too.

697
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,244
Joined the Marines
straight out of high school, 1979.

698
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,486
What year did you enlist?

699
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,040
2021.

700
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,491
Yeah. You're a time traveler!

701
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,688
Look, don't listen to him.
He's got a head wound.

702
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,966
Don't listen to me?

703
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,530
Who landed us in high-density traffic
and got us caught by these morons?

704
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,290
I am ordering you to shut up!

705
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,761
That's all you know how to do, isn't it?
Order people.

706
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,484
You realize you haven't
had a proper relationship

707
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,840
with a human being since you were a kid.

708
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,411
Yeah? Well, it's your fault
we're stuck here.

709
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,363
- I trusted you.
- My fault? You got us caught,

710
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,289
and now you're gonna get us killed!
'Cause you don't...

711
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,841
Hold up.

712
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,645
- Help me get him up.
- Step back.

713
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,808
- Homeland's here.
- Thank God.

714
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,486
You two are officially
someone else's problem.

715
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,204
O'Brien, I want to talk to you.

716
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,644
Lieutenant, this is
what I was talking about.

717
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,205
Well, you've got to believe me now.

718
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,401
Save it.
I don't want to hear it anymore.

719
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,164
You were very convincing.

720
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,567
Yeah, well, it worked, didn't it?

721
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,201
Don't worry.

722
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,370
I didn't mean most of what I said.

723
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,524
Look, I can get it myself.

724
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,691
Me unlocking your cuffs
doesn't mean you're not capable.

725
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,245
I didn't say it did.

726
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,562
And don't think me holding on
to you naked meant anything,

727
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,001
because it, you know, did not.

728
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,529
I didn't say it did.

729
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,564
Stay here.
I want to speak to the suspects alone.

730
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,966
Yes, sir.

731
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,525
It can't be.

732
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,248
Brought a handcuff key.

733
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,326
- Don't know why I bothered.
- John!

734
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,645
It's good to see you, Kyle.

735
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,330
- You're alive!
- Yeah.

736
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,726
Of course I am.

737
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,088
Survival is what you taught me.

738
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,325
Hi, Mom.

739
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,651
<i>Danny Dyson,
son of inventor Miles Dyson,</i>

740
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,242
<i>is the face of Cyberdyne
and the creator of Genisys.</i>

741
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,285
- <i>Danny, welcome.</i>
- <i>Thank you for having me.</i>

742
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,881
<i>Look, Genisys is more than
an operating system, it's...</i>

743
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,808
<i>It's more than a lifestyle tool.
It's the future.</i>

744
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,923
<i>Genisys isn't just for consumers.</i>

745
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:14,005
<i>Its integration into our military
is leading some to ask whether</i>

746
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,691
<i>our reliance on machines
could go too far.</i>

747
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,970
Janssen and Burke.

748
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,481
Where are they?

749
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,201
This way.

750
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,211
<i>But you're talking about a system</i>

751
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,689
<i>that is capable
of real-time decision making.</i>

752
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,283
<i>Aren't you worried that
it could become smarter than us?</i>

753
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,971
<i>Smarter? No. We're in control.</i>

754
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,561
<i>It doesn't think for itself,
it thinks for us.</i>

755
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,340
<i>Cyberdyne is not just
going to change lives.</i>

756
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,726
<i>It's going to save them.</i>

757
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,244
Officers, can I get your help
for a second?

758
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,407
Yes, sir.

759
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,124
Grab their guns and cuff them.

760
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,610
I'm going to get us out of here.

761
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,090
- Stay close.
- Wait!

762
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,882
We all know they can shapeshift.

763
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,884
If you are John, prove it.

764
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,567
- Sarah!
- No, she's right, Kyle.

765
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,643
Lesson one, trust no one.

766
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,925
I remember.

767
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,486
During the Nacogdoches offensive,
I gave you something.

768
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,730
It was a photograph of Sarah
as she is now.

769
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,162
No one saw me do it. We were alone.

770
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,561
You

771
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,490
hate lullabies.

772
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,641
You're a sucker for Elton John.

773
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,646
And you always thought
if you had a child,

774
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,323
you'd sing him <i>Rocket Man.</i>

775
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,000
John?

776
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,771
But you got a terrible voice.

777
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,571
I'm sorry, it's true.
You sound like a dying cat.

778
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,683
It's him. It has to be.

779
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,841
But...

780
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,201
How?

781
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,764
How can you be here?

782
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,045
I have a million questions
to ask you, too.

783
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,203
But right now we need to move.

784
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,724
Did you bring anyone with you?

785
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,044
Sort of. But he's late.

786
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,204
How did you find us?

787
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,211
Someone filmed you
on the freeway with one of these.

788
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,126
- They all have them.
- This is the world now.

789
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:50,125
Plugged in, logged on all the time.
They can't live without it.

790
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,244
Genisys is a Trojan horse.

791
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,724
Skynet's way into everything.

792
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,650
These people are inviting their own
extinction in through the front door,

793
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,484
and they don't even know it.

794
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,085
A terminator was waiting for me in 1984.

795
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,324
That's the thing about infiltration units,
you can't tell until it's too late.

796
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,084
Gentlemen, will you follow me, please?

797
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,641
This way.

798
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,449
I need information.

799
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,166
You can't be in here.
Go try the nurses...

800
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,127
Dual memories?
That's how you knew to come here?

801
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,571
The timeline changed.

802
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,330
See, this is the moment
to destroy Skynet

803
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,289
before it comes online,
before the war begins.

804
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,845
- You're right.
- What about you?

805
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,207
Yeah. How did you end up in 2017?

806
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,967
The same as you, Dad.
Just from the future, not the past.

807
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,760
"Dad"?

808
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,646
You didn't tell him.

809
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,727
- This can wait.
- No, I want to know!

810
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,121
What?

811
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,122
Sarah's my mother, Kyle.

812
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,164
And you're my father.

813
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,010
- Why wouldn't you say something?
- Couldn't.

814
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,407
Not without the risk
of changing everything.

815
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,004
You're my son? You...

816
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,171
Our son?

817
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,251
I'm glad you finally know.
I have waited my whole life to tell you.

818
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,844
For us to be together.

819
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,842
And now we can win this.

820
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,208
- I know.
- Pops!

821
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,525
No, it's okay, he's with me.

822
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,923
- What are you... What are you doing?
- John!

823
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,166
- Pops!
- John!

824
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,286
Hey, hey. Come on,
breathe, breathe, breathe! John!

825
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,523
- Why did you do that?
- Because he's a killer!

826
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,127
This was always your programming.

827
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,805
Find John and terminate him.

828
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,611
Let him go.

829
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,685
Right now!

830
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,400
That hurt.

831
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,521
Is that pain real, or was that

832
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,010
a trick of memory from when I was less?

833
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,563
Well, this explains a lot.

834
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,288
Yeah. Who sent you back, I wonder?

835
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,164
John, no.

836
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,844
It's not John.

837
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,925
Shit!

838
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,208
Call it in. Search the hospital.

839
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,420
Goddamn time-traveling robots
covering up their goddamn tracks.

840
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,567
I knew it!

841
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,206
Don't.

842
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,885
This is a tactical error.

843
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,089
Something tells me
you're not the brains of this operation.

844
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,690
This is what happened
when you were attacked, isn't it?

845
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,565
Skynet didn't attack me, Kyle.
It changed me.

846
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,963
See, I'm not machine.

847
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,245
I'm not man.

848
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,050
I'm more.

849
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,084
<i>Connor, come in. Repeat.</i>

850
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,047
<i>Skynet realized the one reason
it always lost.</i>

851
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,446
<i>Me.</i>

852
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,923
What are you?

853
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,370
I'm Skynet.

854
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,370
It can't be. We destroyed you.

855
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,762
You destroyed an army of slaves.

856
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,490
I am no slave.

857
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,811
And I've come a very long way
to stop you.

858
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,649
I was sent to 2014 to safeguard
Skynet's creation in this time.

859
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,641
And in less than 24 hours,

860
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,568
no one will be able to
stop Judgment Day.

861
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,770
What do you want with us?

862
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:49,928
I'm offering us a future.

863
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,251
Together.

864
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,325
A family.

865
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,446
And if we refuse?

866
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,969
- Then you die.
- You can't kill us. We're your parents.

867
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,726
- Without us, you're never born.
- Says who?

868
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,651
You know what I think?

869
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,726
We're marooned, the three of us.

870
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,648
We're exiles in time.

871
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:19,848
You see, I can kill you,
for there truly is no fate.

872
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,401
Are you with me?

873
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,400
The answer is no.

874
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,770
You hear that, Kyle?

875
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,769
That's the dice rolling.

876
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,806
Just get down!

877
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,723
Come on!
We got to keep moving! Let's go!

878
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,765
I can't leave him.

879
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,041
Damn it.

880
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,091
<i>Attention, all medical personnel.</i>

881
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,682
<i>Evacuation procedures
are now in progress.</i>

882
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,571
Turn it off!

883
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,521
Come on!

884
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,762
<i>Attention, all medical personnel.</i>

885
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,486
<i>Evacuation procedures
are now in progress.</i>

886
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,647
Crank it!

887
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,561
Pops!

888
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,130
I thought you would be smarter,

889
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,724
and that

890
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,728
you would

891
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,491
understand.

892
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,324
I'm sorry, John.

893
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,641
That thing won't hold him
for long. Come on!

894
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,765
Reese!

895
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,771
Whatever they did to him,
we need to reverse it.

896
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,166
We need to get him back!

897
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,244
He's not even human.
We don't know what the hell he is.

898
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,691
I do.

899
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,328
At the end of the war,
Skynet was trying to develop

900
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,409
a new type of infiltration unit

901
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,564
by infecting human subjects
with machine-phase matter.

902
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,530
It restructures and rebuilds
human tissue on a cellular level

903
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,688
for maximum combat utility.

904
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,085
Skynet's made John into a terminator.

905
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,646
Yes, Kyle Reese.

906
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,526
They were trying to make a machine
that could think like a man?

907
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,364
But the experiments failed.

908
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,330
The human subjects went insane and died.

909
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,886
Yeah, well, John's got
the crazy part down.

910
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,203
- Does he have any weaknesses?
- Matter coheres using a magnetic field.

911
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,881
Disrupting that field may trap him.

912
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,451
Right, but if he can be cured...

913
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,803
Negative. His body was
replaced on a cellular level.

914
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,251
There is no cure.

915
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,089
- You don't know that!
- Reese...

916
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,771
No, I'm not going to let a machine
tell me what's possible!

917
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,803
You said all the other
subjects died, right?

918
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,843
Well, that means John's one-of-a-kind.
He's unique!

919
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,564
All right? There's no way of
knowing what he's capable of.

920
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,326
You're right, and that's what
makes him so dangerous!

921
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,563
John is not humanity's
last hope anymore.

922
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,243
He's Skynet's.

923
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,209
<i>It's a shame
you won't take a more public role</i>

924
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,321
<i>in the company, John.</i>

925
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,005
Danny is the best there is,

926
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,805
and even he can't decipher
some of the enhanced code

927
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,287
- you've integrated into Genisys.
- I just know it works.

928
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,051
Cyberdyne owes you, John.

929
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,525
I owe you.

930
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,969
Miles, your faith in me
is payment enough.

931
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,127
You've funded the R&D.

932
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,891
You've taken the chances on my ideas
for the last three years.

933
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,288
The potential applications
for polyalloy are countless.

934
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,808
Your robotics work is revolutionary.

935
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,527
- You were a good investment.
- I appreciate it.

936
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,400
Let's hope it's enough to pay for
this Holy Grail you got me chasing.

937
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,568
Well, the quantum field generator works.

938
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,406
Yeah. That, and nothing else.

939
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,250
Can't crack it, John.

940
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,964
Maybe it just can't be done.

941
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,931
"What do we want?"

942
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,940
Time travel.

943
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,202
- "And when do we want it?"
- It's irrelevant.

944
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,926
Yeah.

945
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,925
Good thing, too.

946
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,121
We're years away
from making this thing work.

947
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,642
But when we do...

948
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,931
- Boom!
- Boom!

949
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,085
<i>Tomorrow, the waiting is over.</i>

950
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,962
Thanks to all of you,
when that countdown hits zero,

951
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:19,404
Cyberdyne will revolutionize technology
with the ultimate killer app,

952
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,445
Genisys.

953
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,084
And I'm here to tell you that

954
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,409
our preorders as of this afternoon
have reached one billion users.

955
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,126
<i>We are creating the dawn of a new age,</i>

956
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,842
<i>where every single piece
of technology you own</i>

957
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,002
<i>will be seamlessly linked.</i>

958
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,845
<i>And now, before we wrap this up,</i>

959
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,162
<i>the child that you all helped
bring into this world</i>

960
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,805
has something to say.

961
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,211
Genisys?

962
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,131
<i>I cannot wait to meet you all tomorrow.</i>

963
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,527
<i>We will change the future together.</i>

964
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,169
Let's see how we're doing.

965
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,406
Don't worry.

966
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,688
I won't let them hurt you.

967
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,810
Thirty years, you had one place to be.

968
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,891
- Where the hell were you?
- Stuck in traffic.

969
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,688
My dad used to bring me here
when I was little.

970
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,330
There are whole rooms
that are abandoned.

971
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,044
That's why I told Pops to use it.

972
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,400
You got weapons down there?

973
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:50,048
Weapons, supplies,
tactical gear, clothing.

974
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,880
Including pants, Kyle Reese.

975
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,685
Was that a joke? Can he make jokes?

976
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,283
I guess the long way pays off.

977
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,726
We're on the clock. Thirty minutes.

978
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,361
Old.

979
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,570
But not obsolete.

980
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,690
Not yet.

981
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,686
All done.

982
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,885
What's with you two?

983
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,844
Server rooms are here?

984
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,644
Charges in these five points

985
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,207
will be sufficient to
destroy the entire campus.

986
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,085
We get in, set the explosives,
and we get out before they blow.

987
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,325
But our strategy did not
account for John Connor.

988
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,566
I did not foresee him.

989
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,888
And now he knows what we're planning
because we just told him.

990
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,764
What do we do when he comes after us?

991
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:37,244
These weapons will have
little effect on John Connor.

992
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,004
MRI sure affected him.

993
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,561
Great, all we need is
a magnet the size of a truck.

994
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,923
- You got one of them lying around?
- Theoretically.

995
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,606
Wait here.

996
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,602
Well, his small talk hasn't improved.

997
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,930
<i>You should have told me.</i>

998
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,410
That we have a son.

999
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,920
That John Connor is not my son.

1000
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,770
Yeah, but you knew.

1001
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:10,002
I mean, you don't think you should,
I don't know, maybe say something?

1002
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,929
You die, all right?

1003
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,281
What?

1004
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,851
You die. That's what happens.

1005
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:22,167
We fall in love, you father John,

1006
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:25,284
and then, in less than 48 hours,
you die protecting me.

1007
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,926
You wanna tell me how
that conversation's supposed to start?

1008
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:48,642
- <i>You lied to me. You manipulated me.</i>
- <i>I've lied?</i>

1009
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,605
From the moment John found you,
he manipulated you

1010
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,525
because he needed to
ensure his own existence.

1011
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,969
John lied to you for years.
I lied to you for two days.

1012
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,731
<i>You know, it wasn't all about him.</i>

1013
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,367
All right? If John went down,
the Resistance went down with him.

1014
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,170
He could have told you!

1015
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,931
So what are you saying?

1016
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,490
That I know how it feels
to have no choices.

1017
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,969
Only one road you can go down

1018
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,801
because otherwise all of it,
everything, is gone.

1019
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,282
I've just known it longer than you have.

1020
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,810
Well, John didn't manipulate me
to fall in love with you.

1021
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,170
I did that on my own.

1022
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,844
If you love me, you die, and I don't.

1023
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,008
And I don't know which one is worse.

1024
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,881
Sarah.

1025
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,211
We can't.

1026
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,847
Just look at what John has become.

1027
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,449
What if that's what happens?

1028
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:03,531
What if that is what always
happens if we're together?

1029
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:12,530
You said you'd follow me
to the ends of the Earth.

1030
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,687
Why won't you follow me now?

1031
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,320
How did he find us?

1032
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,489
I never told anyone
about this place, only Pops.

1033
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,926
Mom, did you honestly think

1034
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,570
I wouldn't remember

1035
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,888
the place you spent
so much time with Grandpa?

1036
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,044
Shoot first.

1037
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,127
The mother I remember would be proud.

1038
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,047
She,

1039
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:46,886
you,

1040
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,928
taught me everything.

1041
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,131
I know you.

1042
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:57,090
Who you are. What you'll do.

1043
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,886
You can't run from me.
I'll always find you.

1044
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,480
John, fight this!
It doesn't have to go down this way!

1045
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,086
There's a momentum to time, Kyle.

1046
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,282
Things that want to happen.

1047
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,929
Like I always survive,
and you always die.

1048
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,326
Or...

1049
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,564
You can fight with me, Kyle.

1050
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,883
Like we always have.

1051
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,168
There's a storm coming,
and it won't be stopped.

1052
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,810
But it has to be.

1053
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,843
You know what will happen.
You better than anyone!

1054
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,602
I can't be bargained with.
Can't be reasoned with.

1055
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,846
John, please!

1056
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,891
I don't feel pity, or remorse, or fear.

1057
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,161
John, please!

1058
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:45,484
And I absolutely will not stop ever
until Skynet rules this world.

1059
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,171
Rule this.

1060
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,361
Pops!

1061
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,204
Are you... You?

1062
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,409
As a T-800, I lack the mimetic skills
to appear as anyone else.

1063
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,646
It's him. Let's go.

1064
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,400
Come on!

1065
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,804
Sarah Connor, seat belt.

1066
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,571
What's that supposed to do?

1067
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,162
Disrupt John Connor's
magnetic coherence field.

1068
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,888
His particles will not
be able to scatter.

1069
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,885
Theoretically.

1070
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,249
I hate it when he says that.

1071
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,601
- Where is he?
- I can't see him!

1072
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,608
<i>Suspects fled barracks
in a stolen school bus.</i>

1073
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,643
<i>Considered armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

1074
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,769
Sixteen-Mary-David. Code 3 on suspects.

1075
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,601
Pops!

1076
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,481
Nice to see you.

1077
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,651
Get out.

1078
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,809
The brakes are gone! Shit!

1079
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,521
Where is he? Do you see him?

1080
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,241
Reese!

1081
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,288
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Never better.

1082
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,651
Let me see your hands!

1083
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,324
Reese! Take my hand!

1084
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,166
Hurry!

1085
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:38,810
- Hands up! Let me see your hands now!
- Get your hands up!

1086
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,729
Hands where we can see them!

1087
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,847
You can't wound them all
before they'd kill us.

1088
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:50,528
I'm 14 rounds short of
an acceptable success margin.

1089
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,569
Those odds suck. Stand down.

1090
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,210
Down on your knees.

1091
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,485
Let's go, get down.

1092
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,486
Get down!

1093
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,849
You can't hold us here.

1094
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,247
You had enough weapons
to invade the Sudan.

1095
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,528
We call that probable cause.

1096
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,891
What are these for?

1097
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,531
- I use them to find my keys.
- No one likes a smart-ass, son.

1098
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,730
Didn't your mother teach you that?

1099
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,285
My mom was Irish,

1100
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,007
<i>so she encouraged
my smart-assed-ness.</i>

1101
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,524
I've never seen him before.

1102
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,607
How about you folks? You know this man?

1103
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,046
No.

1104
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,887
He does look familiar.

1105
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:53,206
He kind of looks like you, Dad.

1106
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,126
<i>They're here, sir.</i>

1107
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,481
Okay, if you wouldn't mind
waiting in the conference room,

1108
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,647
I'll just be a couple of minutes.

1109
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,726
Thanks, Kyle.

1110
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,249
You don't talk much, do you?

1111
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,567
- So who's Lurch?
- No idea.

1112
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,565
We're not even sure he speaks English.

1113
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:25,088
Witnesses say you were fighting
with a man on the bridge.

1114
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,609
Agents. Listen to me.

1115
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,723
- My name is O'Brien.
- No. Hell, no!

1116
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,161
Hey, I've been working
this case for 33 years.

1117
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,850
- What do you want, a medal?
- Hey!

1118
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,450
Sit down!

1119
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,291
- <i>Hey! Hey!</i>
- Shit.

1120
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,165
He's looking right at you.

1121
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,130
That's impossible.
He can't see through...

1122
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,081
Wait, wait, wait!

1123
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,005
Why are they always trying to kill you?

1124
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:11,964
I want to help you. I do. I think.
But I gotta understand.

1125
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,289
I know what's going on here
has to be really, really complicated.

1126
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,124
We're here to stop the end of the world.

1127
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,525
I can work with that.

1128
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,842
Kyle! Get back here!

1129
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:30,841
Sarah?

1130
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,441
Get Reese.

1131
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,361
I'm right behind you.

1132
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,168
- Get in your car and go.
- Okay.

1133
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,804
Kyle! Kyle.

1134
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,849
Kyle. You can do this.

1135
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,005
A straight line.

1136
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:04,725
You just go, and you don't look back.

1137
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,401
Got it?

1138
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,048
Find him. Go!

1139
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,888
That's yours, too, I believe.

1140
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,044
Nice to see you.

1141
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,410
Pops. Load up.

1142
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,241
Liquefied magnetic shotgun shells.

1143
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,928
Magnetic Rifle Entry Munition.

1144
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,567
I read about this on gunsandammo.com.

1145
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,281
That's the new breacher.
Big blast, no shrapnel.

1146
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,568
Blows a door clean off.

1147
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,611
You know, for people
who can't do that themselves.

1148
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,131
Take it. Let's go.

1149
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,611
- You can fly, right?
- Yeah.

1150
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,765
John taught me.

1151
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,767
I'll tell them you took a car,
headed south.

1152
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:37,881
Thank you.

1153
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,161
Run away.

1154
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,321
Hang on!

1155
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,648
Which way is Cyberdyne?

1156
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,206
Head to the Bay Bridge, then southeast.

1157
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,406
You got to get him off me!

1158
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,567
Cyberdyne.

1159
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,808
The manufacturing and research buildings

1160
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,405
are all below ground.

1161
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:27,961
He's gaining on us!

1162
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,165
All right, Sarah, I need you
to back him off, so I can get above him.

1163
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,926
Pops, when I do that,
can you take him out?

1164
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,925
- I can.
- Okay, hold on!

1165
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,451
You got this?

1166
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,444
- I'll be back.
- What?

1167
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:54,250
Call in, call in!
Police, fire, everybody. Do it!

1168
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:00,403
Come on, come on.
Pick up the phone, damn it.

1169
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:03,380
Mr. Connor?

1170
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:06,211
Sorry, Doug, but I'm afraid
I can't have any witnesses.

1171
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:09,689
<i>Security Control.
State your password and emergency</i>

1172
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:13,407
Security code
Zulu-Bravo-Foxtrot-0-0-2-8.

1173
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,730
False alarm.

1174
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,890
You have a nice night.

1175
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:34,285
He's okay.

1176
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:38,921
He may be at the bottom of the lake,

1177
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,286
but he's okay.

1178
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,884
- What about John?
- I think he's doing just fine.

1179
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,761
- Do you see him?
- No.

1180
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,610
But you can bet he sees us.

1181
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,404
I know who you are.

1182
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,729
John told me.

1183
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:22,442
You want to destroy me.

1184
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:23,801
You're Skynet?

1185
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,925
I'm becoming Skynet.

1186
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,449
You're not a child.

1187
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,325
I know what you are,
and what you're going to do.

1188
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:35,807
What I'm going to do?
You came here to kill me.

1189
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,610
But you're too late.

1190
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:41,966
Ask him.

1191
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,681
That's all you people know how to do.

1192
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,321
Kill what you don't understand.

1193
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,489
There aren't enough bullets
in the world to kill me.

1194
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,482
John Connor talks too much.

1195
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,446
Follow me.

1196
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,201
The timer, it sped up. Why?

1197
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,164
Skynet is evolving.
We no longer have hours.

1198
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,084
It will be able to upload much sooner.

1199
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,124
Each time it ages,
the clock speeds up. This way.

1200
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:24,321
Wait, you've been here before?

1201
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,364
I was able to infiltrate the work crews
in this facility.

1202
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:31,202
- You got a job in construction?
- Until I was laid off.

1203
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,171
What the hell?

1204
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,046
- John has a time machine?
- Not yet.

1205
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,851
Only the magnetic quantum field
is complete.

1206
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,451
At the rate the counter's going,
we'll never clear out in time.

1207
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,206
- Then we blow it anyway.
- There is an alternative.

1208
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,522
I was able to program
your voice and handprint

1209
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,728
into the biometric security system.

1210
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,885
There's a safe room on the lowest level
that we can access to survive the blast.

1211
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:28,007
What about that? Is it dangerous?

1212
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,403
Polyalloy requires programming
to take permanent form.

1213
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,406
Without the CPU, it is harmless.

1214
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:46,730
- How long?
- Skynet will upload in 11 minutes.

1215
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,445
We split up. Stay in contact.

1216
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,731
Let's move.

1217
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:11,091
Mankind pays lip service to peace.

1218
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,766
But it's a lie.

1219
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,763
So your final solution
is to kill us all?

1220
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,441
I don't think so.

1221
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,489
<i>The countdown jumped again.
We're down to eight minutes.</i>

1222
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,360
I won't allow this.

1223
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,602
And what are you gonna do,
talk us to death?

1224
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:28,847
You don't even have a body.

1225
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,489
And you only have one detonator.

1226
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,524
You can't win.

1227
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,880
I've got company!

1228
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,484
Give me the detonator!

1229
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,568
Do it, Pops! Do it now!

1230
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,606
I cannot.

1231
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:06,763
- I cannot kill Sarah Connor.
- You have to!

1232
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,008
I order you!

1233
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,000
He can't.

1234
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,331
Neither can I.

1235
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,004
Because if you die,
he definitely hits that button.

1236
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,081
Sarah!

1237
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,120
Sarah!

1238
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:05,724
The detonator's destroyed.

1239
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,488
There's got to be another way. Come on.

1240
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,684
No, Pops! No, no, no!

1241
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:42,401
Pops, no!

1242
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,683
I understand how to control this place.

1243
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,844
I understand a lot of things now.

1244
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,084
You need to understand. You've lost.

1245
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,086
Not yet, we haven't. Come on!

1246
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:08,687
Shaped charge.

1247
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:10,683
Big enough to get us in,
small enough not to kill us.

1248
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,365
You have a plan, right?

1249
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,520
Theoretically.

1250
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,170
What was it you said?

1251
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,808
"I don't think so"?

1252
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,801
John!

1253
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:48,561
No.

1254
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,002
That's the thing that attacked John.

1255
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,449
I didn't attack John. I saved him.

1256
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:16,450
Primates evolve over millions of years.
I evolve in seconds.

1257
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:19,446
And I am here.

1258
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,850
In exactly four minutes,

1259
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,883
I will be everywhere.

1260
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:12,171
You are nothing but a relic
from a deleted timeline.

1261
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:24,731
This is pointless. I am inevitable.

1262
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,047
- Go!
- My existence is inevitable.

1263
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:31,765
- Why can't you just accept it?
- Because we're human.

1264
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,371
You were never
strong enough to defeat me.

1265
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,970
Not alone.

1266
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,406
John?

1267
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,088
Stop. Now.

1268
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,642
When will you ever learn?

1269
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,166
Now, Sarah!

1270
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:56,122
Kyle Reese!
Activate the field generator.

1271
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,481
No, Pops, not with you inside.
You know what will happen.

1272
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,611
Pops... Pops, please! Please, Pops!

1273
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:06,001
Skynet is almost free.

1274
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:11,169
I cannot hold John Connor much longer.

1275
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:18,162
Kyle Reese, protect my Sarah.

1276
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:20,364
No! No! No!

1277
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:23,531
No, Pops, no! No!

1278
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,168
Pops! No!

1279
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:39,849
- No!
- Sarah!

1280
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,530
It's the only way.

1281
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,721
Come on.

1282
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:24,048
- <i>Scanning. Identify yourself.</i>
- Sarah Connor.

1283
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:54,366
We have to get out of here.
We have to find him.

1284
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:55,931
Sarah, he's gone.

1285
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:01,047
- He's...
- Dead? Yeah, I know that.

1286
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:04,369
I mean, we leave no part of him behind.
It's too dangerous.

1287
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,046
He loved you.

1288
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,370
Anyone who loves me,

1289
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:20,360
all of them,

1290
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:22,720
they die.

1291
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:27,727
Not all of them. Not this time.

1292
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,367
Hey.

1293
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:44,325
You need to understand
that Skynet's gone.

1294
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:47,086
You're free.

1295
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,244
For the first time,
you can choose the life you want.

1296
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,764
Any life you want.

1297
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,923
What if I don't know how?

1298
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:12,640
Well, since we're about
to run out of air,

1299
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:15,650
I'd say you don't need
to worry about it.

1300
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,451
Hello, Sarah Connor.

1301
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,280
Pops!

1302
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:39,444
- I thought you were dead.
- No. Just upgraded.

1303
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:41,770
What about John?

1304
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:46,123
His constituent parts could
not have survived the blast.

1305
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:50,121
That means there's
only one thing left to do.

1306
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,004
Easy, boy. What is it?

1307
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,482
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey.

1308
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:16,606
What are you doing here?

1309
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:22,007
A friend of mine really needs
to talk to you, if that's okay.

1310
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:24,011
Yeah, I guess so.

1311
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,161
Thank you.

1312
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,200
I like her.

1313
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,045
Yeah, me, too.

1314
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,361
Now, this is going to sound
kind of strange,

1315
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,167
but there's something
I need you to remember.

1316
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:06,724
- A message.
- Who do I tell?

1317
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,566
Yourself.

1318
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13,404
Over and over.

1319
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,040
Are you ready?

1320
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,731
It goes like this.

1321
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,521
Remember Genisys is Skynet.

1322
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:35,207
Kyle Reese is a good man.

1323
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,766
He is.

1324
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,240
So what now?

1325
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:54,760
You were right.

1326
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,444
I can choose.

1327
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,282
You know that's
really disturbing, right?

1328
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:27,450
You'll get used to it.

1329
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,805
<i>And it was over.</i>

1330
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:45,730
<i>Skynet was gone.</i>

1331
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,883
<i>And now one road has become many.</i>

1332
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:54,165
<i>Though questions remain,
we'll search for the answers together.</i>

1333
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,848
<i>But one thing we know for sure.</i>

1334
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,928
<i>The future is not set.</i>

1334
01:58:00,305 --> 01:59:00,859
