1
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:42,404
In ancient times, the world was
ruled by gods and monsters.

2
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:47,534
But it was the half-god Perseus,
my son...

3
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:51,371
...who defeated the Kraken
and saved humanity.

4
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:57,335
For his courage, I offered him
a place to rule at my side.

5
00:00:58,796 --> 00:00:59,838
But Perseus...

6
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:03,758
...was strong-willed
and chose a different path.

7
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:07,095
He vowed to live as a man.

8
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,070
Even when fate took his wife...

9
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,906
...he would not pray for help, from me...

10
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,117
...or the other gods.

11
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,705
And now the time of the gods is ending.

12
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,167
But the son of Zeus cannot hide
from his destiny forever.

13
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,880
Now pull it in. Do it again.

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,009
Throw in the other one real quick.
Go on. I'll tie this off.

15
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,558
Good catch today, Dad.

16
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,272
- Where'd you get that?
- I made it myself.

17
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,944
You made it yourself? Heh.

18
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,697
I want to be a good god
and do good things.

19
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,700
- There's no such thing as good gods.
- Some of them are good.

20
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,537
Ah. Helius, there's more to life
than gods and Titans.

21
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,624
Hey, Clea. I have a confession to make.

22
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,294
I, uh, needed him for chores
so he skipped studying.

23
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,257
Now, you do a good job, make me proud.

24
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,199
I know you're here.

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,167
I visit him sometimes in his dreams.

26
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,920
He's like his father. A strong-willed boy.

27
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,422
You just passing through?

28
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:57,872
No.

29
00:02:59,041 --> 00:02:59,916
I need your help...

30
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:01,167
...Perseus.

31
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:04,462
You're the great god Zeus.
You don't need my help.

32
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,590
There is a calamity coming.

33
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:10,760
It will affect us all. Gods and men.

34
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:14,472
- The humans may have stopped praying to us...
- With good reason.

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,182
...but there are consequences.

36
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,561
Without prayer, we gods lose our power.

37
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:24,440
When our power leaves us,
all our work comes undone. All of it.

38
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,828
The walls of Tartarus are falling.

39
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:41,833
It is emptying all its demons onto the earth.
The first are already here.

40
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:47,255
If our power diminishes much further,
we gods will become mortal.

41
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:50,008
We will die and Kronos himself will escape.

42
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:54,220
It will mean chaos. The end of the world.

43
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,306
What am I meant to do?

44
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,475
This is business for gods.

45
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,644
We need all our children now.

46
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:04,189
Perhaps, together...

47
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,815
...we can remedy this.

48
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,735
But we need every shred of power, Perseus.

49
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:13,698
I will never leave my son.

50
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:19,704
I know your heart better
than you know it yourself.

51
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,417
You believe your human half
makes you unworthy to join us.

52
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:26,127
You will learn someday that...

53
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:27,837
...being half-human...

54
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:31,216
...makes you stronger than a god,
not weaker.

55
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:34,260
I think you should go.

56
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:39,307
Sleep well, Perseus.

57
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,525
I will never leave my son.

58
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:32,879
Zeus.

59
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,347
Poseidon.

60
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:44,515
Brother.

61
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:48,353
It has been an age.

62
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:51,397
Indeed, it has.

63
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:55,568
Ares.

64
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,737
My son.

65
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,282
Where's my brother Perseus?

66
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,369
Gone fishing?

67
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:06,746
Yes.

68
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:09,749
What a brave and noble decision.

69
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:17,715
Let us go, then.

70
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:36,275
Tartarus. The great prison
of the underworld.

71
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:41,489
Brother Hades!

72
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:45,660
We have come to your domain...

73
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:47,829
...as agreed!

74
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,831
Show yourself to us!

75
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:00,633
After so many years...

76
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:04,887
...the sons of Kronos, together once more.

77
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:06,764
Brothers in arms.

78
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:08,349
Hades...

79
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:12,770
...you are the great ruler of the underworld.

80
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:16,566
Allow us to enter and help you rebuild...

81
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:17,984
...the walls of Tartarus.

82
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:22,488
My beloved brother,
who banished me here for eternity...

83
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:25,908
...to look after our father, now seeks...

84
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:27,702
...reconciliation.

85
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:32,039
We must forget the past, brother...

86
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,458
...and unite.

87
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:39,589
Yes.

88
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:41,632
But on my terms.

89
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:46,679
Poseidon!

90
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:58,816
Above you!

91
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,074
Poseidon.

92
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:27,762
It has begun.

93
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:11,931
Helius?!

94
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:13,808
Helius!

95
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:19,855
Stay away, stay away!

96
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:27,238
Helius?

97
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:28,656
Helius.

98
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:57,643
Chimera!

99
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,777
Helius!

100
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:10,197
Have you seen Helius?!

101
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:14,994
Helius!

102
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,580
Get back!

103
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:21,834
Keep away! Its venom catches fire!

104
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:25,546
Stay down!

105
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:55,701
Helius, go with them!

106
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,374
Take him!

107
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,750
I'll find you! Go!

108
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,421
Go!

109
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:16,097
- Dad!
- Run!

110
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:16,931
Go!

111
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:24,730
Helius!

112
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,904
- Dad, hurry!
- I'm coming, son!

113
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,908
Helius! Stay there!

114
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,330
Dad!

115
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:51,424
Helius!

116
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,551
Here!

117
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:55,136
Come and get me!

118
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,586
What are you waiting for?! Burn me!

119
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:36,737
Sit.

120
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:43,869
Ohh.

121
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:47,039
Things are happening...

122
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,959
...in the world, Perseus.
You know that, you have instincts.

123
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:52,127
The son of a god.

124
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:56,423
A son needs a father.

125
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:58,175
I made a vow to lo.

126
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:02,429
I know, I know,
I was there delivering your son.

127
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:05,349
You vowed to your wife
you'd never let Helius wield a sword.

128
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:07,685
That you'd live with him
as a simple fisherman.

129
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:12,815
Well, that's a fine game in normal times.

130
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:16,235
But if you have power, you also have a duty.

131
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:19,488
Just fix my body...

132
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,824
...and leave my soul to me.

133
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:29,665
Where are we going?

134
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:33,252
I need to speak to my father.

135
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:36,422
There's nothing to be frightened of.

136
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,554
This is the Mount of Idols.

137
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,848
The closest place to the heavens.

138
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,268
It's a place where people come
to worship the gods.

139
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:54,023
Or at least they used to come.

140
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:57,651
Zeus?

141
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,621
Father.

142
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:30,934
Poseidon.

143
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:32,227
What happened?

144
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:35,064
Hades and Ares have joined Kronos...

145
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:36,940
...against humanity.

146
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:40,110
All the gods have disappeared.

147
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:43,364
- I fear the worst.
- Here, here.

148
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:46,241
I got you, I got you.

149
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:51,163
Where's my father?

150
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:52,539
Captured.

151
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,251
You must journey to the underworld
and free him.

152
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,295
They took my father.

153
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:00,547
You're the only hope left in this world.

154
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:02,883
Or there will be oblivion.

155
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:10,974
How do I do it?

156
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,018
I'm only half a god.

157
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:15,229
Then you must find another half-god.

158
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:17,731
Agenor.

159
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:19,900
He's my son.

160
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:26,615
He's with Queen Andromeda.

161
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:29,827
Tell him to take you to the Fallen One.

162
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:34,790
Poseidon.

163
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:41,880
Take this. Use it.

164
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:43,549
If my son...

165
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:46,301
...survives and proves worthy...

166
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:48,554
...give it to him.

167
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:26,717
My own son betrays me.

168
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:31,054
Only when it suits you,
you remember I am your son.

169
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:33,557
Hades.

170
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:37,102
You're sweating like a human, brother.
Next, it'll be tears.

171
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,937
Don't waste words on him.

172
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:42,065
Kronos is waiting...

173
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,567
...Father.

174
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:46,236
What?

175
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:48,697
Our father has offered us a deal.

176
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,532
You fool!

177
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:53,744
If we help him to escape Tartarus...

178
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:58,207
...he will allow we few gods who remain
to keep our immortality.

179
00:18:58,374 --> 00:19:00,626
- No!
- Let him speak.

180
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:02,586
Let him speak.

181
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,380
Are you becoming weak?

182
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:10,093
You're in the underworld, Ares,
where it's wise to obey me.

183
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:15,349
You forget our father once tried to kill us.

184
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,768
No, I remember everything.

185
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:23,440
And what exactly does our father want from us
in return for our precious immortality?

186
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:28,946
We simply offer him the last of your
divine powers so that he may free himself.

187
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:33,033
Oh, Hades.

188
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:37,037
What have I done to you?

189
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:49,091
You laugh as if you had a choice.

190
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,051
There is no choice.

191
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:57,182
I hope you have enough of them.

192
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:58,559
Pull him.

193
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:22,499
You'll need it more than me.

194
00:20:27,755 --> 00:20:28,881
Pegasus.

195
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:35,762
Go on.

196
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:50,068
He likes you.

197
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:56,491
Me, on the other hand....

198
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:02,289
I love you.

199
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:03,957
I know.

200
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:06,251
Come on.

201
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:16,678
Eh, whoa.
Keep it straight. Have it look good.

202
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:48,168
Come on, boy.

203
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:53,548
More Chimera! Archers!

204
00:21:54,342 --> 00:21:56,051
Go, go, go!

205
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:58,553
Ready! Fire!

206
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:04,393
- Chimera!
- Ready!

207
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:06,186
Hold your lines. Hold your lines!

208
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:10,107
Out of the way!

209
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:12,401
Hold your fire!

210
00:22:12,944 --> 00:22:15,654
- I said hold your fire!
- Queen Andromeda.

211
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:18,865
Ah, keep it straight. Oy!

212
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,119
Whoa!

213
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:34,214
You used to be a lot better at this.

214
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:41,513
All hail Perseus, killer of the Kraken.

215
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:43,640
Hail Perseus!

216
00:22:48,396 --> 00:22:50,439
Great Perseus.

217
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,818
If it is action you're after, you are a little late.

218
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,654
I'm just here to see Queen Andromeda.

219
00:22:57,822 --> 00:23:00,115
This is a battlefield.

220
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:02,617
- I am in command here.
- Uh-huh.

221
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:05,120
Well, I wish to speak to the queen.

222
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:07,622
And the queen wishes to speak to you.

223
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,876
Your Majesty.

224
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,212
Come on.

225
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:17,215
Hail Perseus.

226
00:23:28,227 --> 00:23:31,104
You've obviously been
in your own battles, Perseus.

227
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:34,024
I've been busy with mine.

228
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,901
Yeah, you have.

229
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:43,075
I won't keep you.

230
00:23:46,454 --> 00:23:48,121
It's been too long.

231
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:55,045
- I have a son now.
- I know. I'd like to meet him.

232
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:58,465
- And my wife, she--
- I know.

233
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,717
I'm sorry.

234
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:03,678
Your Majesty.

235
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:10,227
For the sake of the men, we must
resolve our differences before sunset.

236
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:12,229
I made it clear we continue to fight...

237
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:13,939
...the Chimera invaders.

238
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:16,525
Today in the field we lost 300 men...

239
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:19,361
...for the death of four Chimera. We have...

240
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,906
...offended the gods. We need to pray.

241
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:24,658
You'd pray to Ares, perhaps?

242
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:27,035
As soldiers always have.

243
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,996
What if I was to tell you that Ares
is your enemy now?

244
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:31,623
I would make peace with him.

245
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,918
You would make peace with the god of war?

246
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,378
Perseus.

247
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:39,214
What's your strategy?

248
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:44,219
There's a way we can end this,
and then I can get home.

249
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,305
- What is this for?
- It's to cut the oars for my trireme.

250
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:48,557
I need 170 oars...

251
00:24:49,517 --> 00:24:50,183
...for the three rows...

252
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:51,017
...one oar per man.

253
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:53,186
This looks like a pick.

254
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:55,772
- It is, however, the rudder for my flagship.
- Quiet!

255
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:58,233
Morning checks, Your Majesty.

256
00:24:58,776 --> 00:25:00,610
Always eventful.

257
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:03,864
Oh, Your Majesty. Ah. So good to see you.

258
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:07,826
- This is Agenor. He's a liar and a thief.
- I know it didn't work out between us...

259
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:10,328
...but, please, do try and get over it.

260
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:12,914
Have you ever had a woman
love you so much...

261
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:15,125
...she locks you up like a pet rabbit?

262
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:17,043
He wanted my hand in marriage.

263
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:20,172
When I refused, he tried to run away
with the crown jewels.

264
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:22,424
I think it's my extraordinary eyes.

265
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:25,010
Actually, you got the eyes of your father.

266
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:29,264
Do you know his father?

267
00:25:30,057 --> 00:25:31,558
Yeah, Agenor here...

268
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,935
...he's the son of the great god Poseidon.

269
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:39,941
Your new boyfriend is clearly insane.

270
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,194
I'm your cousin, Agenor.

271
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:44,112
I'm the son of Zeus.

272
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:47,407
Half-god and abandoned just like you.

273
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:50,994
If my father sent you...

274
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:53,121
...I want nothing to do with you.

275
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:55,790
Your father is dead.

276
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,501
Gods don't die.

277
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:00,295
They do now.

278
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,464
Good. Could you do me a favor?

279
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:04,716
- Anything.
- Go to hell.

280
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:07,928
That's exactly where I'm going.

281
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:13,058
I just need information.

282
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:15,560
Your father told me...

283
00:26:15,728 --> 00:26:17,938
...that you could help me
get to the Fallen One.

284
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:27,280
You long for the ocean, don't you?

285
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:30,867
It's like a thirst you cannot quench.

286
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:35,247
It must be hell for you in here.

287
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:45,257
I want a royal pardon.

288
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:49,052
Granted.

289
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:51,805
I want my body weight in gold.

290
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,224
Granted.

291
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:57,602
Few gold coins, you're so scrawny.

292
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,939
Let me see. What else have I dreamt of
as I lay here in my cell?

293
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:02,440
Don't push it.

294
00:27:04,193 --> 00:27:06,653
I'm gonna need a boat, your fastest boat.

295
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:09,114
The Fallen One lives far across the ocean.

296
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:10,782
Where?

297
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,702
Well, put me on the deck of the boat
and I'll show you.

298
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:21,418
Your ship awaits.

299
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:24,254
Fetch my lucky cape.

300
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:30,051
Do you know why
this is my lucky cape, me old mate?

301
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:34,222
Because the first time I wore it,
I sprouted a beard. A full-grown beard.

302
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,057
Send word to every regiment...

303
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:39,311
...that's still intact to gather here
at the Tyrene pass.

304
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:43,023
If I'm not there in two days...

305
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:45,150
...then you can pray.

306
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:47,485
Your Majesty.

307
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:51,156
- Regroup at the garrison!
- You can't leave...

308
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:53,199
...Greece without a queen.

309
00:27:54,618 --> 00:27:56,494
Are you giving me orders now?

310
00:28:11,052 --> 00:28:12,469
Unchain him.

311
00:28:19,852 --> 00:28:21,436
Show me where the Fallen One is.

312
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:24,439
Who is the Fallen One?

313
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:27,817
Oh, the god Hephaestus.
Heh, heh.

314
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:31,696
And who's Hephaestus?

315
00:28:33,616 --> 00:28:36,493
Hephaestus was the god
that made Poseidon's trident...

316
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:38,787
...Hades' pitchfork...

317
00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:40,372
...and Zeus' thunderbolt.

318
00:28:41,374 --> 00:28:42,499
Put those together...

319
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:45,960
...they form the Spear of Trium,
the weapon the gods used...

320
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:47,587
...to defeat Kronos.

321
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:49,839
But Hephaestus lives on the island of Kail.
Ha-ha-ha.

322
00:28:50,508 --> 00:28:52,467
Which no one has ever found.

323
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,637
Kail doesn't exist, does it, Agenor?

324
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,807
It does...

325
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:00,266
...exist. I can take you.

326
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,685
Unchain me and give me the trident.

327
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:06,231
If you unchain him, he'll jump off
this boat, you'll never see him again.

328
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,566
Hephaestus can help you save your father.

329
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,798
Don't let our family down.

330
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:01,536
Never doubted you for a second, Agenor.

331
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:39,115
Great Kronos.

332
00:30:39,283 --> 00:30:40,325
Father.

333
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:44,370
We have delivered Zeus, your son...

334
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:47,540
...as you ordered.

335
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,962
Zeus.

336
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:07,977
Island of Kail.

337
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:14,484
I'm not touching that again.

338
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,004
What is it?

339
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:38,967
I don't know.
But whoever did this doesn't want us here.

340
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:40,176
We have no choice.

341
00:31:41,053 --> 00:31:43,596
Fallen god has to live as close
to the heavens as possible.

342
00:31:43,764 --> 00:31:44,847
Streams run through.

343
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:46,808
Higher ground's that way.

344
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,254
- What--?!
- Look!

345
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:17,380
Don't move!

346
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:28,057
I can't see nothing.

347
00:32:28,225 --> 00:32:30,268
- We should pray to the god of war.
- Warriors!

348
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:33,980
I know it is your custom,
but no matter what we're about to face...

349
00:32:34,148 --> 00:32:35,940
...you do not pray to Ares.

350
00:32:37,443 --> 00:32:40,445
If you do, he will find us and kill us all.

351
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:42,572
Close in.

352
00:32:43,324 --> 00:32:44,824
Stay alert.

353
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:53,791
Trip wire.

354
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:56,419
- Agenor!
- Yeah, yeah. Saw it.

355
00:33:03,302 --> 00:33:06,137
The most important thing is to do nothing.

356
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,181
Nothing, I can do well.

357
00:33:11,435 --> 00:33:13,311
Aah! For the love of Zeus!

358
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,104
I told you to do nothing!

359
00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:16,356
I didn't do anything!

360
00:33:18,484 --> 00:33:19,650
No, no, no!

361
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:23,988
Cut the counterweights.

362
00:33:27,368 --> 00:33:29,285
Don't cut the counterweight!

363
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:31,412
Yeah, he's right, the fall will kill him.

364
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:48,805
Cut the counterweight!
Cut the counterweight!

365
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:55,978
Agenor!

366
00:33:57,064 --> 00:34:00,024
Cut the counterweight!
Cut the counterweight!

367
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:01,442
Agenor!

368
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,823
Agenor!

369
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:33,307
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

370
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,602
Stay down!

371
00:34:37,438 --> 00:34:38,563
Ah!

372
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:40,440
What is it?

373
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:41,899
Big!

374
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:43,609
Andromeda, slow him down!

375
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:57,373
Now!

376
00:34:57,749 --> 00:34:59,375
Archers!

377
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:00,460
Galenos...

378
00:35:00,669 --> 00:35:02,920
- ...give him support.
- You, follow me.

379
00:35:16,268 --> 00:35:17,185
No!

380
00:35:53,222 --> 00:35:55,306
I pray to you, great god Ares. I pray to you--

381
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:56,682
Shh.

382
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:04,899
Is it gone?

383
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:24,835
Hey!

384
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,004
This is gonna be a bad idea.

385
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:40,661
Where's my cousin?

386
00:37:53,258 --> 00:37:54,634
Glad you're hanging in there.

387
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:56,844
Yeah, I thought I'd give him an eyeful.

388
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,264
What was that for?

389
00:38:02,184 --> 00:38:04,060
Poseidon.

390
00:38:27,376 --> 00:38:29,543
Poor Ares, always...

391
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:31,170
...following orders.

392
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:34,298
I am my own master.

393
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:36,592
Yes, of course you are.

394
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:39,637
Perhaps it's only humans...

395
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:41,055
...that have free will.

396
00:38:46,144 --> 00:38:47,395
There.

397
00:38:48,939 --> 00:38:51,607
Pain! Your lesson in being human.

398
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:53,734
Why don't you weep?

399
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:56,112
Why not weep like
your favorite son, Perseus?

400
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:04,120
If I weep, it will be for you, Ares.

401
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,248
Ares.

402
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,125
Enough.

403
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,544
Weep for your son!

404
00:39:11,712 --> 00:39:13,129
I said...

405
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:14,547
...enough!

406
00:39:14,756 --> 00:39:16,882
We are in this together, Hades.

407
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,218
Do not weaken now.

408
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:24,223
Your weakness is your blind hatred
for your father and your brother.

409
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:29,437
You don't know when to stop fighting.

410
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,605
You've already won.

411
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:35,401
Kronos is draining Zeus' power.

412
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:23,532
Hephaestus.

413
00:40:42,177 --> 00:40:43,636
Zeus?

414
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:45,596
Ares!

415
00:40:45,764 --> 00:40:47,556
Hades!

416
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:51,268
At last! I knew you'd come.

417
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:54,939
Poseidon, I can see your trident glinting.

418
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:57,817
Ha-ha-ha. Ah.

419
00:41:00,237 --> 00:41:01,070
It's not...

420
00:41:01,238 --> 00:41:02,279
...them.

421
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,493
We're looking for Hephaestus, the maker...

422
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:11,205
- ...of such mighty weapons.
- Well, should I let them in?

423
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:13,916
He says no!

424
00:41:15,752 --> 00:41:18,420
But then he always says no.

425
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:23,384
He always says...

426
00:41:24,427 --> 00:41:25,845
...no.

427
00:41:26,054 --> 00:41:26,762
Ahh.

428
00:41:27,264 --> 00:41:28,931
Yes.

429
00:41:36,606 --> 00:41:38,566
You are Perseus...

430
00:41:38,942 --> 00:41:40,985
...son of Zeus.

431
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:43,612
I am.

432
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,323
"Release the Kraken," all of that.

433
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:50,160
- Yeah.
- Who are you?

434
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:53,873
I'm Agenor, son of Poseidon.

435
00:41:56,126 --> 00:41:57,626
Agenor.

436
00:41:58,128 --> 00:42:00,045
Have you ever heard of Agenor?

437
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:02,381
Never heard of you.

438
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:05,718
Well, your friend may also
know me by the name...

439
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,012
...the Navigator.

440
00:42:09,514 --> 00:42:11,181
Navigator?

441
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:14,435
Navigator!

442
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:17,980
Still no.

443
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:21,150
Don't worry, son, he says
there are many useless demigods.

444
00:42:21,693 --> 00:42:25,529
"Useless"? About as useless
as your one-eyed friends.

445
00:42:25,697 --> 00:42:26,739
Those Cyclopes...

446
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:29,533
...helped me forge the god-weapons.

447
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:32,661
Have respect.

448
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,667
"Navigator."

449
00:42:38,835 --> 00:42:40,294
Mm-hm.

450
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:42,963
Hold on, because--

451
00:42:43,965 --> 00:42:47,927
Poseidon dead, Zeus captured. The words...

452
00:42:48,094 --> 00:42:49,595
...don't even sit together.

453
00:42:49,763 --> 00:42:51,639
We need your help to rescue Zeus...

454
00:42:51,806 --> 00:42:53,432
...so he can stop Kronos.

455
00:42:55,518 --> 00:42:57,603
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yeah.

456
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:01,649
Right. Right. Well, in that case,
we'd best prepare.

457
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:04,401
- For what?
- The end of the bloody world.

458
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:06,528
Kronos will dismantle the earth.

459
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:09,865
You'll be scattered across the universe.

460
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:11,450
Fantastic.

461
00:43:13,578 --> 00:43:15,037
You forged these weapons...

462
00:43:15,205 --> 00:43:17,957
...right here for the gods.
You must be able to help us.

463
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:20,709
Shut it! How could I...

464
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:22,336
...when I've no godly power anymore?

465
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:23,295
Who's he talking to?

466
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:24,880
Don't you...

467
00:43:25,048 --> 00:43:26,298
...walk away from me.

468
00:43:26,466 --> 00:43:29,218
His all-powerful father
took it away from me...

469
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:32,262
...when I sided with Hades
in their little family argument.

470
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:36,475
Yes, I know now it was a mistake!

471
00:43:36,643 --> 00:43:38,894
People forget!

472
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:43,941
In the beginning, Hades was wise...

473
00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:47,903
...and just and strong.

474
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:51,615
It were your daddy became drunk on power.

475
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:54,118
We were even hoping...

476
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:58,789
...when Zeus came he might see
his mistake and restore our--

477
00:43:59,374 --> 00:44:02,251
Why not? He might have, had he come.

478
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:10,009
I'm sorry...

479
00:44:10,176 --> 00:44:13,178
...that you think being human
is not enough. But we humans...

480
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:15,848
...hope when there's no hope.

481
00:44:16,057 --> 00:44:19,727
And we believe when to believe is idiotic.

482
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,730
But sometimes, in spite...

483
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:25,357
...of everything, we prevail.

484
00:44:27,652 --> 00:44:28,736
Now...

485
00:44:31,281 --> 00:44:32,656
...which of you two...

486
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:34,575
...is in charge?

487
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:36,160
- I am.
- Then...

488
00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:40,497
...if we were gods...

489
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:43,917
...how would you help us free Zeus?

490
00:44:45,962 --> 00:44:47,254
Oh, my dear.

491
00:44:49,466 --> 00:44:50,841
You remind me of someone.

492
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,512
Aphrodite.

493
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:58,474
She was my wife.

494
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:03,062
Come with me.

495
00:45:03,646 --> 00:45:06,023
If Zeus is captive in the underworld...

496
00:45:06,191 --> 00:45:09,318
...he's likely being held
in the heart of Tartarus.

497
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:13,822
There can't be much time
before his life force...

498
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,115
...is completely sapped.

499
00:45:15,283 --> 00:45:17,117
But how do we get to him?

500
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:18,660
We can't.

501
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,704
Normally you'd be right, young man.

502
00:45:26,544 --> 00:45:29,630
But when I designed this marvel...

503
00:45:29,923 --> 00:45:32,549
...I included a secret passage, a shortcut...

504
00:45:32,717 --> 00:45:33,759
...if you will.

505
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:36,053
- You designed Tartarus?
- Oh, aye.

506
00:45:36,596 --> 00:45:38,138
And built it.

507
00:45:38,723 --> 00:45:40,808
Aphrodite, I could...

508
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:43,268
...not only get you inside...

509
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:46,814
...I could give you a guided tour.

510
00:45:51,611 --> 00:45:53,487
In order for the prison of Tartarus...

511
00:45:53,655 --> 00:45:55,906
...to be completely impregnable...

512
00:45:56,074 --> 00:45:58,992
...I built it from the outside in.

513
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,995
So I had to leave a passage
for meself to get out...

514
00:46:02,163 --> 00:46:05,040
...when the work was done.
And this labyrinth...

515
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:08,418
...is the only way a human
can travel through the underworld...

516
00:46:08,586 --> 00:46:12,381
...and get to the heart of Tartarus.

517
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:46,582
Where's my snarling bastard of a son Ares?

518
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:50,502
Will Kronos really spare him?

519
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:52,212
And you?

520
00:46:54,924 --> 00:46:57,467
Is there no end to this?

521
00:46:58,177 --> 00:46:59,344
I'm afraid, brother.

522
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:02,723
Is that what you want me to say?
I'm a god and I'm afraid.

523
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:03,849
Well, you should be.

524
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,645
When your precious humans die,
at least their souls go to another place.

525
00:47:09,314 --> 00:47:12,149
When a god dies, it isn't death.

526
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,568
It's just absence.

527
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:17,321
It's nothing.

528
00:47:19,782 --> 00:47:26,622
It's oblivion.

529
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:30,918
Perseus.

530
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:36,131
Perseus.

531
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,759
Father.

532
00:47:41,012 --> 00:47:42,638
I'm close.

533
00:47:43,014 --> 00:47:44,598
Stay with me.

534
00:47:44,933 --> 00:47:47,476
You see, if you align the edges correctly...

535
00:47:47,644 --> 00:47:50,354
...it gives you a shifting depiction
of the interior.

536
00:47:50,563 --> 00:47:52,314
Can I say, that is a masterpiece.

537
00:47:52,482 --> 00:47:54,316
Well, useful to a point.

538
00:47:54,525 --> 00:47:57,069
- Would you let a lowly navigator hold it?
- No.

539
00:47:57,236 --> 00:48:00,489
Well, you are the son of Poseidon.

540
00:48:00,823 --> 00:48:05,202
He's the one who taught me to navigate.
That, and how to seduce a mermaid...

541
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,746
...which seemed random,
but came in handy more often...

542
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:10,290
...than you'd think. Thing to do is...

543
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:13,293
...don't talk to her, talk to her friend.

544
00:48:16,881 --> 00:48:20,008
Navigator, this is the entrance
to the labyrinth.

545
00:48:20,176 --> 00:48:24,304
There are hundreds of doors,
all of which would kill you...

546
00:48:25,223 --> 00:48:27,182
...save one. You see...

547
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,767
...I designed it to play...

548
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:31,353
...tricks with the mind. After all, the mind...

549
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:33,021
...is the greatest trap of all.

550
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:36,149
So you've got to control your fears...

551
00:48:36,317 --> 00:48:38,819
...so you don't turn on yourself
or each other...

552
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:41,196
...if you wanna make it to Tartarus.

553
00:48:48,997 --> 00:48:49,663
There it is.

554
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:52,040
There's our door.

555
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:57,671
Everybody back!

556
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:08,473
Oh.

557
00:49:09,017 --> 00:49:11,143
Which one of you prayed to him?!

558
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:44,217
You betrayed our father.

559
00:49:45,178 --> 00:49:46,970
He betrayed me...

560
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:49,264
...by choosing you.

561
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,211
You beauty!

562
00:50:21,506 --> 00:50:23,757
Come on! It won't stay open...

563
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:24,966
...for long!

564
00:50:36,145 --> 00:50:38,313
No, not now!

565
00:50:49,909 --> 00:50:50,700
Great god Ares...

566
00:50:50,868 --> 00:50:53,745
...be merciful. It was I who prayed
to you. I was taught...

567
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:57,124
...to pray for my enemies.
I prayed you would find peace...

568
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,543
...in your hear-- Ah! Ah!

569
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:06,842
We are brothers...

570
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:08,635
...but not equal.

571
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:16,476
I have got to give them more time.

572
00:51:25,695 --> 00:51:28,738
One last godly thing.

573
00:51:28,906 --> 00:51:29,990
Come on!

574
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:32,951
Let's see what you blee--!

575
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:35,078
Perseus!

576
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:38,665
Hephaestus.

577
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:39,666
Aah!

578
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,837
Perseus! The door's...

579
00:51:44,005 --> 00:51:45,380
- ...closing!
- Come on!

580
00:51:45,548 --> 00:51:46,631
Ares!

581
00:51:47,675 --> 00:51:49,509
Is that all you got...

582
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:50,635
...you sniveling...

583
00:51:51,554 --> 00:51:52,596
...dog?

584
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:54,890
Get to the door!

585
00:51:56,184 --> 00:51:57,184
- Come on!
- Come on!

586
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:22,959
Oh, Korrina.

587
00:52:24,253 --> 00:52:26,755
She was a fool to pray to him...

588
00:52:27,924 --> 00:52:30,967
...and he was a coward to kill the weak.

589
00:52:31,135 --> 00:52:33,720
He has fought in many wars.

590
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,097
He's slaughtered innocents for centuries.

591
00:52:37,016 --> 00:52:37,682
It's all...

592
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:38,892
...he knows.

593
00:52:40,478 --> 00:52:41,645
I can't beat him.

594
00:52:42,396 --> 00:52:43,396
Mutton head.

595
00:52:43,606 --> 00:52:47,150
Two days ago I was trapped in a cell
in a dungeon, admittedly...

596
00:52:47,318 --> 00:52:50,445
...trying to escape,
unbecoming of the son of Poseidon.

597
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,116
But today I'm here,
and I'm trying to save the universe.

598
00:52:55,534 --> 00:52:56,826
Jump in.

599
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,671
Your Majesty...

600
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:11,174
...I realize in a labyrinth
with a million possibilities...

601
00:53:11,342 --> 00:53:13,468
...this is the last thing you want to hear...

602
00:53:15,096 --> 00:53:16,513
...but follow me.

603
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:22,894
That way.

604
00:53:27,024 --> 00:53:28,483
Or this way.

605
00:53:48,087 --> 00:53:48,753
I don't know...

606
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:50,964
...how we'll get through this
without Hephaestus.

607
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,222
Perseus.

608
00:54:04,395 --> 00:54:06,313
Where is your son?

609
00:54:17,158 --> 00:54:18,950
This way.

610
00:54:25,082 --> 00:54:26,374
That way.

611
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:50,106
This way!

612
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:01,659
Andromeda.

613
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:04,829
Korrina.

614
00:55:05,748 --> 00:55:07,499
You must turn back.

615
00:55:15,674 --> 00:55:16,508
This should be...

616
00:55:16,675 --> 00:55:18,843
...a corridor. This map makes no sense.

617
00:55:19,053 --> 00:55:20,595
Andromeda.

618
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:26,476
There's something in here with us.

619
00:55:28,479 --> 00:55:30,939
- Just give me the map.
- No.

620
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:33,775
The mighty Kraken slayer.
Shouldn't he be somewhere...

621
00:55:33,943 --> 00:55:35,610
- ...posing for a statue?
- Agenor...

622
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:38,738
- ...just give me the map!
- The map is useless!

623
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:48,415
This way!

624
00:55:54,171 --> 00:55:54,921
Agenor!

625
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,592
I know where we're going!

626
00:56:06,392 --> 00:56:07,684
This way!

627
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:19,779
Get back!

628
00:56:28,831 --> 00:56:29,497
Back!

629
00:56:36,589 --> 00:56:37,630
Get up!

630
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:51,060
Andromeda!

631
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,401
Yes.

632
00:57:09,455 --> 00:57:10,955
Take the weight!

633
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:18,421
Come on, come on, come on!

634
00:57:22,092 --> 00:57:23,426
Go, go!

635
00:57:23,802 --> 00:57:25,094
Go!

636
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:12,976
It's cold in here, isn't it?

637
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:31,411
You're not real.

638
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:33,621
Helius?

639
01:00:02,086 --> 01:00:05,963
Why are
you doing this? Please, Dad, don't kill me.

640
01:01:06,108 --> 01:01:08,401
- Perseus!
- Perseus.

641
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:10,153
What happened?

642
01:01:16,702 --> 01:01:17,702
Tartarus.

643
01:01:20,581 --> 01:01:21,581
Come on, let's go.

644
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:23,708
Come on.

645
01:01:33,469 --> 01:01:36,554
Kronos has his power now.

646
01:01:37,848 --> 01:01:39,432
Hades.

647
01:01:41,894 --> 01:01:43,352
I am so sorry.

648
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:45,354
For what?

649
01:01:46,064 --> 01:01:47,565
For having banished you.

650
01:01:49,735 --> 01:01:51,486
Can you forgive me for that?

651
01:01:52,613 --> 01:01:54,238
Why do you ask?

652
01:01:55,866 --> 01:01:58,534
Because I forgive you for this.

653
01:02:00,496 --> 01:02:02,580
Release me, Hades.

654
01:02:02,748 --> 01:02:05,291
I know there is still good in you.

655
01:02:14,176 --> 01:02:16,052
You have no pride, Hades.

656
01:02:17,095 --> 01:02:18,262
No.

657
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:21,432
I won't let you kill him.

658
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:24,560
Brother.

659
01:02:28,232 --> 01:02:29,690
You can't stop this.

660
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:47,959
Ares!

661
01:03:19,867 --> 01:03:21,158
Come on.

662
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,792
Go, go!

663
01:03:35,132 --> 01:03:37,008
Father. Father!

664
01:03:37,593 --> 01:03:38,426
Father!

665
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:39,760
Open your eyes!

666
01:03:41,805 --> 01:03:43,306
Perseus.

667
01:03:44,558 --> 01:03:46,601
Perseus, my son.

668
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,996
Use the power inside you.

669
01:04:33,148 --> 01:04:33,856
Perseus...

670
01:04:34,024 --> 01:04:34,690
...hurry!

671
01:04:59,508 --> 01:05:01,092
- Ares!
- Andromeda!

672
01:05:18,777 --> 01:05:19,694
Hades...

673
01:05:19,861 --> 01:05:20,903
...come with us.

674
01:05:46,555 --> 01:05:47,888
No!

675
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,226
Hades.

676
01:06:01,028 --> 01:06:02,862
Weapon. Give it to me.

677
01:06:04,406 --> 01:06:05,698
Hold them.

678
01:06:40,108 --> 01:06:41,025
Mantius, impressive.

679
01:06:41,443 --> 01:06:44,862
- You gathered a fine army.
- I have prepared a royal tent.

680
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,655
And is it fit for a god?

681
01:06:47,282 --> 01:06:48,866
- Great Zeus.
- Great Zeus.

682
01:06:49,034 --> 01:06:50,534
Great Zeus.

683
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:57,333
Kronos...

684
01:06:57,501 --> 01:07:00,294
...will come for me, Perseus.

685
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,047
I don't have the power left to stop him.

686
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:07,176
I wanted...

687
01:07:07,344 --> 01:07:09,762
...to leave the world safe for you. I failed.

688
01:07:10,597 --> 01:07:12,848
I should have come with you.

689
01:07:13,016 --> 01:07:14,517
- I was just--
- You pulled me...

690
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:16,560
...out of Tartarus.

691
01:07:17,938 --> 01:07:19,230
You saved me.

692
01:07:20,398 --> 01:07:22,858
How do you suppose you did that?

693
01:07:23,777 --> 01:07:26,862
I never stopped thinking about
getting home to my son.

694
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:29,865
Then you use that. Fight for your son.

695
01:07:30,909 --> 01:07:32,201
Remember:

696
01:07:33,078 --> 01:07:36,038
Only the Spear of Trium can defeat Kronos.

697
01:07:36,206 --> 01:07:38,749
And the hand that holds that spear
will have to be...

698
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:40,000
...yours.

699
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:48,884
We have two pieces of the Spear of Trium.

700
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,929
Poseidon's trident...

701
01:07:53,598 --> 01:07:54,807
...and Hades' pitchfork.

702
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:57,309
So, what we need is Zeus' thunderbolt.

703
01:07:57,477 --> 01:07:59,019
Which is on Ares' back.

704
01:08:02,065 --> 01:08:03,232
Yep.

705
01:08:05,235 --> 01:08:06,360
Ares.

706
01:08:07,571 --> 01:08:10,865
Ares.

707
01:08:11,908 --> 01:08:13,242
Brother.

708
01:08:15,162 --> 01:08:16,954
I pray to you.

709
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,749
Meet me at the temple of the gods.

710
01:08:23,253 --> 01:08:25,171
You say we're not equal.

711
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:28,924
So come prove to me...

712
01:08:29,092 --> 01:08:30,092
...you're right.

713
01:08:33,722 --> 01:08:36,849
Prove to our father that you're right.

714
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:40,603
I hear you, brother.

715
01:08:47,903 --> 01:08:49,528
I'll get the spear. You hold him off.

716
01:08:56,494 --> 01:08:57,828
Don't give me the big speech.

717
01:08:58,622 --> 01:09:00,539
Yeah, I wasn't planning to.

718
01:09:24,022 --> 01:09:24,855
Our battle plan...

719
01:09:25,482 --> 01:09:26,565
...must be simple.

720
01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:28,234
Three lines of defense:

721
01:09:28,401 --> 01:09:30,486
Agenor's men will hold the front line...

722
01:09:30,654 --> 01:09:31,737
...from the trenches.

723
01:09:31,905 --> 01:09:32,780
Cover every part...

724
01:09:32,948 --> 01:09:34,740
...of yourself, or you'll be burned...

725
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:36,033
...by the fire.

726
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:37,868
Every piece of cloth...

727
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:40,537
...every piece of skin. Help each other.

728
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:41,872
Phalanxes behind that...

729
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,166
...and infantry as the last defense.

730
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,502
I will lead the infantry myself.

731
01:09:47,337 --> 01:09:48,504
And our job...

732
01:09:48,672 --> 01:09:51,924
...is to hold Kronos back
for as long as possible...

733
01:09:52,092 --> 01:09:54,218
...if we're to stand a chance.

734
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,888
- Dig in!
- Position!

735
01:10:00,183 --> 01:10:01,684
Secure positions!

736
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:47,813
Kronos is near.

737
01:11:01,828 --> 01:11:03,620
Makhai!

738
01:11:04,456 --> 01:11:06,081
Makhai!

739
01:11:18,011 --> 01:11:19,887
Light the fires!

740
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:23,390
- Light the fires!
- Light the fires!

741
01:11:26,811 --> 01:11:27,853
Hold!

742
01:11:33,777 --> 01:11:35,277
Fire the artillery!

743
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:36,779
Loose!

744
01:11:39,157 --> 01:11:40,491
Fire!

745
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:28,956
Brother.

746
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:34,586
- Please don't hurt him.
- I'm not going to hurt him.

747
01:12:34,796 --> 01:12:36,255
I'm going to hurt you.

748
01:12:37,382 --> 01:12:38,590
And I want him to watch.

749
01:12:39,634 --> 01:12:41,135
I want you to know...

750
01:12:41,803 --> 01:12:43,345
...what it feels like...

751
01:12:43,513 --> 01:12:47,307
...when someone takes your father away
from you.

752
01:14:12,602 --> 01:14:13,810
Front line, attack!

753
01:14:14,437 --> 01:14:15,270
Stay with me!

754
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:17,481
Stand firm!

755
01:15:12,787 --> 01:15:14,288
So this is what a father...

756
01:15:14,455 --> 01:15:16,623
...would go through for his son?

757
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:49,114
Brother.

758
01:15:50,658 --> 01:15:52,117
I do...

759
01:15:53,244 --> 01:15:54,911
...forgive you.

760
01:16:18,478 --> 01:16:19,144
You look...

761
01:16:19,312 --> 01:16:21,563
...10,000 years younger.

762
01:16:22,023 --> 01:16:23,190
And feel it.

763
01:16:28,571 --> 01:16:31,448
Death was circling you.

764
01:16:31,949 --> 01:16:35,202
That was the last time
I'll have the strength to chase it away.

765
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:38,205
We have the power...

766
01:16:38,373 --> 01:16:42,042
...between us to put on a little display.

767
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,210
Like in the old days.

768
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,462
So shall we finish this?

769
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:46,546
We have no weapons.

770
01:16:46,714 --> 01:16:48,548
We had power before we had weapons.

771
01:16:48,716 --> 01:16:50,509
- When we were young gods.
- Yes.

772
01:16:51,552 --> 01:16:52,594
Let's have some fun!

773
01:19:15,863 --> 01:19:18,114
Helius. Weapons!

774
01:19:36,592 --> 01:19:38,927
Hold the line! Hold the line!

775
01:19:39,095 --> 01:19:40,345
Stand firm!

776
01:19:55,611 --> 01:19:56,861
The Spear of Trium.

777
01:20:10,793 --> 01:20:14,754
Hades.

778
01:20:20,177 --> 01:20:21,928
Zeus.

779
01:20:22,138 --> 01:20:24,180
The first strike's mine, brother.

780
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:03,386
Perseus!

781
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:15,417
Together now, brother!

782
01:22:33,769 --> 01:22:36,855
This is it, boy.
They've given us a chance.

783
01:23:03,549 --> 01:23:04,466
Brother!

784
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,918
Come on, stand up!

785
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:26,060
Perseus! Perseus! Perseus!

786
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,763
He's waiting for you...

787
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,975
...before he goes.

788
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:30,166
Your boy gave you strength.

789
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:32,668
Yes.

790
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,588
As did mine.

791
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:42,636
Perhaps Hades can heal you.

792
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,181
He already gave me my last chance.

793
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:52,813
And you sacrificed it for him.

794
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:57,026
There will be no more sacrifices.

795
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,738
No more gods.

796
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:08,996
Use your power wisely, Perseus.

797
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,892
Thank you, my son.

798
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,840
All my power is spent.

799
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:06,929
Who knows?

800
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:11,225
I might be stronger without it.

801
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,742
I know it's broke. No need to tell me.

802
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:31,328
I could walk on it, but....
My mum always said...

803
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,748
...you should let everyone have
their moment to shine. You know?

804
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,876
So, you know, I'm established.
I've already got a name.

805
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:40,629
You know? The Navigator.

806
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:44,925
If I'm not mistaken...

807
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:48,554
- ...you're the son of Perseus.
- I am Helius.

808
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:51,140
Is that your boy, Helius?

809
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,525
Go over there!

810
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:04,445
Helius!

811
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:05,988
Come here.

812
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,324
I've got a story to tell. Come and meet...

813
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:10,159
...your Uncle Navigator.

814
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,587
I'm Agenor.

815
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:23,255
Helius.

816
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:26,717
I've read that you are
a great disappointment.

817
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,094
That's right, I am great.

818
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,305
This is my nurse, Tiger.

819
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:47,654
We have to be prepared
if there's another attack.

820
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:49,990
We're fortifying Argos
with the third regiment.

821
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:53,285
Our engines will be ready in two days,
so in the west we can--

822
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,639
Dad...

823
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:17,226
...I'm actually looking forward
to going home.

824
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:22,231
I've decided being a boring fisherman
isn't that bad.

825
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:25,192
You know we can't go back home.

826
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:43,377
Take it.

827
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,925
You're Helius.

828
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:53,929
You're son of Perseus...

829
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,348
...the grandson of Zeus.

830
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:00,727
Take it.

831
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:13,031
It's heavy.

832
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,617
Yeah, it is.

833
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:19,913
Is it too much?

834
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:28,714
No.
