[soft music]

00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,133
[mother] Jaywon, let's go,
we need to get ready for school.

8
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,971
Come on now, I don't
have time to fight with you.

[soft music]

10
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,456
[mother] You want milk or juice?

11
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,292
Juice.

12
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,377
- Juice what?
- Juice, please.

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,424
You're going to have to get
yourself home from school again,

14
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,384
today and tomorrow,
I have got to work late again.

15
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,179
But I promise
I'll pick you up on Friday

16
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,555
and we'll do something
after school,

17
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,517
probably go to the park
or something, ok?

18
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,814
Look, Jay.

19
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,693
I know it's a new neighborhood,
and it's new kids,

20
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,278
you don't know one from another,

21
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,031
but you have
to make you some friends, baby.

22
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,283
You hear me?

23
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,578
Alright, you're going to
make me come into your school

24
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,830
in my house shoes and my robe on
and embarrass you.

25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,628
I don't even have a robe.
But I'll get one.

26
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,130
[mother] Let's go babe.

So once the unit's cancelled,

28
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,846
you multiply across the top,
multiply across the bottom,

00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,349
hundred and forty-two thousand
divided by sixteen O nine,

30
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:07,688
you're going to get somewhere
right around 88 miles

31
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,315
every one hour.
Great Scott, right?

32
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,068
[teacher] No? Seriously?

33
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,446
I'm getting old.
Test tomorrow,

34
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,616
Dimensional analysis, alright?
Not only do you need to know

35
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,076
your metric to metric
conversions,

36
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,286
but you also need to know

37
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,538
your imperial to metric
conversions.

38
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,331
Remember that worksheet
that I gave you? Yeah.

39
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,584
Not going to happen this time,
make sure they're up here,

40
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,294
no excuses.
Questions?

41
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,045
[student] What if
I can't study tonight, man?

42
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,882
I've got uh...
I've got things to do.

43
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:39,052
Yeah. Well... Yeah, cute.
Then you fail. I don't know.

44
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,304
Make up your mind, man,
your future.

45
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,597
[school bell ringing]
There it is.

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,223
Go ahead,
get your stuff and go.

47
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,727
[teacher] Come prepared
tomorrow, no excuses.

48
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,978
[student] Hey Mr. Williams,

49
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,564
I know you failed the game
last night, 21 to seven.

50
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,234
[teacher] Dude, don't do that
to me man, that's rough.

51
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,320
I'll tell you what,
those graphs, though,

52
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,529

Oh, sorry man.

55
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,091

to have to go fetch it.

[foreboding soft music]

57
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,389
What? You've got
something to say?

58
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,767
[teacher] Excuse me, gentlemen?

59
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,354
Oh, sorry Mr. Williams.
We were just taking.

60
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,523
[teacher] Yeah, we've got
some place to be, let's go.

61
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,816

Hey, Jake One, come here,
I've got to ask you something.

67
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,817
Where did you get that hat?

68
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,238
Are you retarded?
I'm talking to you.

69
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,243
Hey yo, Jerome? Jean-Marcus?

Where you be getting
your head-set, yo?

71
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,457
What, do you have
something to say?

72
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,959
- Give me my hat.
- What?

73
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,629
Come on, say it one more time,
I didn't hear you.

74
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,464
- I said, "Give me my hat."
- Monkey.

75
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,924
Give me my hat.

I guess not.

I'm not really hungry.

So why did you get food?

129

I don't know.

130
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,208
You know, I heard
that not eating

131
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,417
can actually make you fat.

132

Oh what?
What do you want to do now?

00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,972

Uh, yeah.

144
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,285
Are you ok?

145
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,205
You look really confused.

146
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,082
Uh, I feel confused.

147
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,001
- Math sucks for everybody.
- Huh?

148
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,128
- It was a joke.
- Oh.

149
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,172
- Sorry.
- It's ok, I'm not that funny.

150
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,299
I think you're amazing.

151
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,303
[Heather] I think
this is the most

152
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,013
I've ever heard you talk before.

153
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,598
If I keep talking
will you stay here?

154
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,643
You're pretty funny,
you should talk more.

155
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,645
- You think?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,022
You remind me of a friend
I had before I moved here,

157
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,649
he gave me this bracelet.

158
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,069
So, why did you move here?

159
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,615
My dad died.

160
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,577
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,756
[Roman] Oh, what are you

181
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:27,164
You can come over
and use it if you want to.

182
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,584

00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,478
[teacher] Roman!

Hey, Jaywon!

195
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,999
Ok, so, I texted my mom

196
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,501
and she said
you can come over later.

197
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,295

207
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,413
to kick your ass at school?

208
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,751
Do it outside the school,
not in the school.

209
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,503
Do it outside!

210
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,047
[shouting] I'm sick of you!
Get a fucking job!

[mother] Uh, I'm so happy
to be off of work.

219
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,215
Be happy you don't have to worry
about work and a 12 hour shift.

220
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,384
All you've got to do
is go to school, you come home,

221
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,969
you eat, and that's your day.

222
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,349
What happened to your lip?

223
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,646
I bit my lip at lunch, today.

224
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,814
[giggles] You still
don't know how to chew?

225
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,234
You eat just like your daddy.

226
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,737
And how was school?

227
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,241
It was... it was fine.

228
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,120
Why is my baby smiling?

229
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:16,625
Oh Lord praise that in Heaven,
my baby is smiling!

230
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,962
Ok, ok, I'm not going
to bug you about it.

231
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,215
I just want you to be happy.

00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:25,843
Oh, I'm so happy for you!

233
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,970
Ok, let's go straight home.

234
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,514
Oh, let me get
some chicken and rice.

235
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,225
You love that rice,
Lord knows why.

236
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,935
You want some chicken and rice?

237
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,145
Uh, yeah, sure.

238
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,189
Do you mind if I go
to a friend's house

239
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,316
- later on today?
- A friend?

240
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,611
Oh, I don't know what they put
in the water today,

241
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,154
but I'll take it.

242
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,574
Yes Jay, you go hang out.

243
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,994
But make sure you do
your homework first, ok?

244
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,537
Ok.

Maybe I'll check on you

01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:47,915
[frantic music]

669
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:04,348
She's going to be dead
by the time--

670
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:06,725
[ghostly music]

671
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:20,197
[soft ghostly music]

672
01:11:24,743 --> 01:11:27,496
[soft piano and violin music]

673
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:41,009
Huh, cancel that.

674
01:11:44,096 --> 01:11:45,764
[hangs phone]

675
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:59,319

[car approaching]

677
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,977
Morning.
You must be the new guy.

678
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:33,854
That's me. Kenny.

679
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:37,107
It's good to have someone
on the night shift again,

680
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:38,483
it's been a while.

681
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,320
Been a while?
What about Sam?

682
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:44,489
[Hank] Sam?
How do you know about him?

683
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:46,450
He used to work the night shift,

684
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:49,828
what's it been,
probably seven years or more.

685
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:51,830
[giggles] Seven years!

686
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:55,250
Yeah. He had a heart attack
one night and died

687
01:12:55,334 --> 01:12:57,127
when a young woman
killed herself on a ship.

688
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:59,213
- A young woman?
- Yep.

689
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:02,090
In a maroon Grand Prix,
right over there.

690
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,136
It's funny,
'cause he always used to say

691
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,263
that it was the cigarettes
and booze that would get him.

692
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,892
- Yeah.
- We'd go through a lot of guys,

693
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:13,477
but you're good, right? I mean,

694
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,604
not everyone can handle
the graveyard shift, you know.

695
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:18,899
Most of them quit
after the first night.

696
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:22,277
It takes a special breed,
I think.

697
01:13:24,655 --> 01:13:27,574
It's not always like this?
The first night?

698
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,535
Like what?

699
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:32,287
Nothing.
I'll see you at six.

700
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:35,123
Alright man. Get some sleep.

701
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:43,257
[energetic closing music]

702
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:12,828

703
01:15:03,128 --> 01:15:05,964
[loud electric buzz]

704
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:16,475
[soft piano and violin music]
