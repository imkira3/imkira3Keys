1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,250
Memories that persist through 30 million years...

2
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,480
In the never-stopping, never-reversing,

3
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,700
never-changing flux,

4
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,700
feelings are memories that cross time.

5
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,960
Feelings are memories that have reached the gate of fate.

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,800
A dream?

7
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,120
Karamatta ito ga kishimi atte

8
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,120
The intertwined threads compete

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,560
mujun teiku wo uwagaki suru

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,560
Overwriting any contradictory takes

11
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,500
Rifujin wa itsuka konsen shite

12
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,500
Irrationality is going haywire

13
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,480
ai mo mirai sae mo koroshite yuku

14
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,480
Putting our love and our future to death

15
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,160
Bamen goto ni ukande kuru

16
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,160
The scenes we shared come to mind

17
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,390
kizuna mitaina sono zenbu ga

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,390
All of them like bonds between us

19
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,130
Mabushii hodo kagayai teru

20
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,130
They shine in a blinding light

21
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,950
bajji ni shirushita kakegae nai mono

22
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,950
Inscribed on the irreplaceable badge

23
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,270
I believe it

24
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,900
Fly away sekai wa owari ga hajimaru

25
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,900
Fly away as the world begins to end

26
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,480
Futsugouna asu wo nomikonde ku

27
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,480
The unwanted tomorrow will be consumed

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,190
Loneliness kodoku no deja vu ni toraware

29
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,190
Loneliness, imprisoned in the déjà vu of solitude

30
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,810
Kaisen wa yagate tachikira reta

31
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,810
The circuit is finally severed

32
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,490
Ichiga kiete zeroni naru ishiki no surikae

33
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,490
"1" disappears and becomes "0" as a consciousness is usurped

34
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,730
Anata no me wa ima nani wo utsushi teru no?

35
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,730
What do those eyes of yours reflect now?

36
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,840
Hey, you there.

37
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,990
Can you see us? Why don't you answer us?

38
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,220
I'm talking to you, with the dumb expression!

39
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,890
Tutturu~

40
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,390
I'm Mayushii!

41
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,230
Hey, Lab Member No. 003, Supah Hakah.

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,260
Say something.

43
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,110
It's "Hacker," not "Hakah," duh!

44
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,020
He never says anything.

45
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,260
But there has been a development.

46
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,160
Thanks to a year of persistent effort,

47
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,620
due to our inquisitive minds, he produced offspring!

48
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,110
So cute!

49
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,750
Normalfags should just get out.

50
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,500
It's only logical to assume that somewhere within this software lies

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
the secret code to reconstructing this world's ruling structure!

52
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,380
I'll uncover it at any cost! On my name, Hououin Kyouma!

53
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,770
Daru, do you want some barley tea?

54
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,350
Yes, please.

55
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,120
Mayushii, when you serve tea you should say, "Here's your tea."

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,640
"Here's your tea?"

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,890
Yeah. "I'll leave your tea here," is good too.

58
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,450
And you, Okarin?

59
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,200
Do you think I could drink the beverage of commoners?

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,480
I only consume the intellectual drink of the chosen ones!

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,530
Dr Pepper, right?

62
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,200
Mayuri.

63
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,080
Switch on Future Gadget No.10 Cool Visitor!

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,920
But it doesn't cool the air very well...

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,260
Don't you worry.

66
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,570
It's been half a day since we suspended continuous operation.

67
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,560
It's got plenty of cool air inside.

68
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,310
Really?

69
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,480
So? Feels good, right?

70
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,050
It doesn't feel any different from a normal fan.

71
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,980
Actually, the heat released by the motor is stronger than the cold air.

72
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,910
The tea doesn't feel that cold anymore, either...

73
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,610
Be silent! A new discovery is just around the corner and—

74
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,790
Just shutting off like that is the worst possible thing that could happen to my data!

75
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,170
You—!

76
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,300
If I lose all of my game character data, I'll kill you, and then commit suicide!

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,300
Tears?

78
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,760
Okabe!

79
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,360
Oh, no!

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,180
You bastard! Get down here!

81
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,980
If you need something, then you should come upstairs, Mr. Braun!

82
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,730
Shut it! I'll add 5,000 yen to your rent!

83
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,810
I'll be right there!

84
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,140
Nae!

85
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,190
Mayuri!

86
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,860
Braun Tube Studio

87
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:49,450
Future Gadget Lab

88
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,300
Summer 2010.

89
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,450
One year has passed since I reached

90
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,380
the Steins Gate world line.

91
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,290
Mayuri is alive. Kurisu wasn't killed

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,210
and neither the time machine nor D-mail exist in this world.

93
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:07,070
Time proceeds only forward, never backward,

94
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,370
the future doesn't change,

95
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,390
and there isn't a single other world line in existence...

96
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,020
Mayuri—

97
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,050
Okarin?

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,480
What's wrong?

99
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,090
Nothing...

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,960
Listen, Okarin.

101
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,060
Are you sure?

102
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,680
Yes, the survival of my Future Gadget Lab depends on

103
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,720
this mission I have to clear.

104
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,210
The important mission Mr. Braun entrusted to me is—

105
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,630
Oh. Well, Ruka is waiting for me, so see you later.

106
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,470
Welcome back. Are you here on your summer holiday?

107
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,620
Not your business.

108
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,000
Isn't she here yet?

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,210
It landed a while ago. She shouldn't be long...

110
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,630
Kurisu!

111
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,260
Welcome back!

112
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,260
Mayuri! You came all the way here to pick me up?

113
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,260
Yep. I couldn't wait!

114
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,850
Long time no see.

115
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,860
Indeed... Urushibara, right?

116
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,570
Yes.

117
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,070
But he's a guy.

118
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
You'll stop by the lab, right?

119
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,580
Y-Yes... it's still early, so...

120
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,560
The station has changed a lot too.

121
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,290
Yep, there's a new GunBam Cafe, and an idol bar...

122
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,880
Even Radio Kaikan's been rebuilt.

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,590
A lot's changed in a year, I guess. What about the lab?

124
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,510
No particular change there, I guess...

125
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,470
Oh, but... Daru made a friend!

126
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,180
A girl!

127
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,350
You're kidding!

128
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,080
She's a cosplayer, Amane...Yuki?

129
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,890
Yes. I heard they met online.

130
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,980
She's very pretty.

131
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,780
Pret... ty?

132
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,520
Here she is.

133
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,050
Is... Hashida's family rich or something?

134
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,130
Don't think so...

135
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,500
Then he must have won the lottery.

136
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,040
I didn't hear about anything like that either...

137
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,360
Then...

138
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,520
It's Daru!

139
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,180
Daru!

140
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,930
Mayu—! It's Miss Makise?! Long time—

141
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,020
If you're trying to trick her, come clean!

142
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,890
What are you talking about?

143
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,340
Trick? Daru?

144
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,770
I don't think that's the case...

145
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,520
You said you exchanged photos the other day, right?

146
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,600
What kind of photo did you send?

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,160
Well...

148
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,410
Photoshop, huh.

149
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,760
Of course. No girl would go near such a pervert otherwise.

150
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,250
That's mean! Don't judge!

151
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,930
But she said her type is bear-like guys, didn't she?

152
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,230
Y-Yeah...

153
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,550
Don't you dare assume that a woman saying

154
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,190
"Bear-like guys are my type" means "I'm into fat guys!"

155
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,760
What's that? You're scary!

156
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,930
Messy as always.

157
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,400
Kurisu.

158
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,860
Here's your tea.

159
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,560
Thx!

160
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,450
You still talk like an @channel user...

161
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,360
Shut up!

162
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,650
But Okarin sure is late.

163
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,120
He said that after the errand for Mr. Braun,

164
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,620
he'd go to Ameyoko to buy something.

165
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,880
But Miss Makise took the trouble to come over...

166
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,620
It-It's no big deal!

167
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,490
Kurisu, are you all right?

168
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,470
I'm very all right, Mayuri.

169
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,890
Actually, I'm almost relieved he's not here!

170
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,600
Don't need to waste any energy...

171
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,810
Template: Tsundere Queen.

172
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,900
I'm neither tsun nor dere!

173
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,320
Darn that Mr. Braun!

174
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,190
He chose a faraway store on purpose!

175
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,210
It's me. Yes...

176
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,650
Looks like a new agent from the Organization.

177
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,270
What?! An emergency request?

178
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,950
I got it. If that's Steins;Gate's choice...

179
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,180
"El Psy Kongroo."

180
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,310
Still as annoying as usual.

181
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,680
Sorry.

182
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,840
Long time no see, assistant.

183
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,080
I mean, Cristina.
No, experiment-loving perverted girl.

184
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,980
"Pervert" for short!

185
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,900
There's a limit to rudeness!

186
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,840
Hah! That reaction... It seems you are the real Cristina.

187
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,320
Cristina!

188
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,700
There's no "tina"!

189
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,200
But, Cristina!

190
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,530
The Future Gadget Lab is a secret state organization.

191
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,790
It's only natural that to get in, you need proper authorization.

192
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,050
Remember that.

193
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,010
I'm a lab member. I have the right to come and go as I please!

194
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,590
You haven't shown up for a year
and dare make such a wild claim?

195
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,420
And you call yourself my assistant?!

196
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,420
It feels like being back in the old lab.

197
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,900
I said I'm not your assistant nor am I Cristina!

198
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,900
Yes, Mayushii is very happy.

199
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,360
By the way, experiment-loving perverted genius girl?

200
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,450
No!

201
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,350
Why did you come to Japan, pervert girl?

202
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,590
To apologize for not showing up at the lab?

203
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,410
Why should I apologize?!

204
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,330
There's a conference here in Japan, so I just dropped by!

205
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,330
And I wanted to see Mayuri too.

206
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,130
Here's a souvenir.

207
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,210
Really?! Thank you!

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,800
It's a sewing set I found in the US.

209
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,890
This is for you, Urushibara.

210
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,260
Thank you so much!

211
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,020
And for me, some uncensored American version of something...

212
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,100
Customs would arrest me!

213
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,400
There's nothing for you guys! I only came to see Mayuri and Urushibara.

214
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,670
I wasn't expecting anything in the least!

215
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,080
Now that you understand, leave this place at once!

216
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,760
You don't need to tell me! I was going anyway!

217
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,830
I need to check into the hotel.

218
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,410
What? You're leaving already?

219
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,190
I'll be in Japan for a while. I'll get in touch with you again.

220
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,750
Sorry for the wait, Kyouma! Nyan~!

221
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,220
Sorry for intruding...

222
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,590
Faris and Moeka! What are you two doing here?

223
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,060
What? Aren't we having a barbecue? Nyan~!

224
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,930
Kyouma just came by and said, nyan~,

225
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,760
that we should have a barbecue today because Ku-nyan is coming.

226
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,360
I... got a mail...

227
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,190
Okarin...

228
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,370
What's this? Due to the increasing activity of a solar storm,

229
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,820
auditory hallucinations and unlikely telecommunications are occurring?!

230
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,580
Don't tell me the Seven Sages of Seiryuzan have sprung into actionyan!?

231
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,100
That's unforgivable! I'll demand an apology!

232
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,880
Calm down, please!

233
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,140
The fact that all the lab members have been reunited here

234
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,840
is Steins;Gate's choice.

235
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,800
Mayuri! Prepare for the round table meeting!

236
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,790
Okay!

237
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,930
Rukako!

238
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,260
Y-Yes!

239
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,510
You didn't say the password.

240
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,350
E... El Psy... Kongree?

241
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,520
It's "Kongroo," Ruka.

242
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Kurisu, you do have time, right?

243
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,090
Kind of...

244
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,220
No more tsundere!

245
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,530
You too, Okarin.

246
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,500
He can never be honest about his feelings...

247
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:23,340
Mix! Mix! Mix! Mix! Mix! Mix!

248
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,540
Wow! Eye-contact Mix Mix Yakisoba!

249
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,940
Oh, that may be a bit undercooked.

250
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,250
No problem.

251
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,430
It was undercooked...

252
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,230
The second was fine.

253
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,080
Oh! Nae, you can eat peppers?! I'm impressed!

254
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,050
Yeah, but my daddy can't.

255
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,150
It's been a year...

256
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,700
What... was that?

257
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,610
Okabe!

258
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,080
What's up, Cristi—

259
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,100
I'm just not convinced!

260
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,300
What are you talking about?

261
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,390
The time machine! It's impossible!

262
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,240
Theoretically—!

263
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,760
You're too close!

264
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,550
Oh! Don't tell me you're—

265
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,120
There should only be alcohol-free beer...

266
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,670
Now this is real beer!

267
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,320
Hey, are you listening?

268
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,590
W-What?

269
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,990
I'm talking about before!

270
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,040
What you told me when you came to the States!

271
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
About another world line, and that something happened to another me...

272
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,070
Then you took advantage of the fact that I didn't understand

273
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,800
and in the confusion, even did that thing...

274
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,590
That... thing?

275
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,060
W-Wait! Are you bringing that up here and now?!

276
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,020
What? So it's really that shameful for you?

277
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,340
No... that's not...

278
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,400
You know, that time... I was quite...

279
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,690
That time...

280
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,300
H-Hey!

281
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,760
Is something wrong, nyan~?

282
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,860
N-Nothing!

283
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,960
Faris' Special End of the Century Yakisoba's almost ready, nyan~!

284
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,420
This guy hasn't even sent me a single email since last summer!

285
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,930
Even after he did "that thing!"

286
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,170
Telling me "I love you."

287
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,000
Then blaming it on another word line—

288
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,490
Give it a break. Come here!

289
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,890
Let go of me!

290
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,810
That was dangerous—

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,430
Okabe...

292
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,100
W-What?

293
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,980
Hold me!

294
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,820
H-Hey...

295
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,280
Shave. Shave.

296
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,280
Hey, you! Wait!

297
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,750
Prickly.

298
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,940
What if someone comes?!

299
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,630
You don't want that?

300
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,000
What?

301
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,770
You don't want to be seen?

302
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,090
No, it's not that...

303
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,710
Then it's fine, right?

304
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,380
No... but...

305
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,510
Yes or no?! Which is Steins;Gate's choice?!

306
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,140
No... I-I mean...

307
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,890
You! Be clear!

308
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,730
W-Wait!

309
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,700
Here, assistant.

310
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,030
Cool your head a bit.

311
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,740
Thanks.

312
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,540
Good grief...

313
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,730
Good grief what?

314
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,530
Trying to pick a fight again?

315
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,340
I wish I could tell you.

316
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm a scientist. I don't want to accept the idea of

317
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,300
past life encounters, destiny,

318
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,020
and world lines... or time machines.

319
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,060
I know that...

320
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,640
But... even though I try to deny them in theory,

321
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,560
something keeps bothering me...

322
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,770
My head gets all messed up...

323
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,340
T-This is...

324
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,070
A spoon... and fork...

325
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,780
You wanted them, so...

326
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,370
Yes, I did...

327
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,200
But I never told you that...

328
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,760
I see... It wasn't on this world line...

329
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,340
It feels like someone's been peeping on my thoughts...

330
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,600
Sorry, I'm going to rest a bit.

331
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,060
Okarin, there's going to be no yakisoba left for you!

332
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,330
Hey... Mayuri.

333
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,490
I told you before, right?

334
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,850
That I came here from a different world line?

335
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:15,340
Yes, you were with another Mayushii and another Kurisu, right?

336
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,200
What do you think about that story?

337
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,460
Why?

338
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,430
Well... Kurisu is...

339
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:31,550
Mayushii doesn't think Okarin's lying, so it must be true.

340
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,820
But that's because Mayushii can't understand difficult things...

341
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,760
Kurisu is really smart,

342
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,790
so maybe she's thinking really hard about what Okarin said.

343
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,960
I'll be upstairs, okay?

344
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,170
A time machine...

345
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,590
What?!

346
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,970
Mayuri!

347
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,520
Okarin,

348
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,270
do you know where we put the new dish cloth?

349
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,360
It's not on the shelf, so... maybe it's under the stove?

350
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,940
Here it is! Mr. New Dish Cloth!

351
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,950
What's wrong, Okarin?

352
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,830
This is...?

353
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,230
It's fun to eat outside, even if it's on top of the lab!

354
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:44,010
A barbecue with Faris! My heart's on fire!

355
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,010
Mayuri!

356
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,830
What?

357
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,590
Come this way!

358
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,470
Okarin?! What's wrong?!

359
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,890
Wake up, Kurisu!

360
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,410
Quick!

361
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,170
What's up with you?!

362
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,020
Hurry!

363
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,230
Okabe? What...

364
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,900
Be quiet!

365
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,080
Hey, you guys forgot this on the roof—

366
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,940
Don't move!

367
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,490
What the hell?! Okabe...

368
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,540
Kurisu! The time leap-machine, quick!

369
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,750
We don't have time! Quick!

370
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,250
Okabe, calm down! There's no such thing here!

371
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,590
What are you saying?! It's just over there—

372
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,420
This is the Steins Gate world line?

373
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,940
Steins?

374
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,590
Yes, the world line you told me

375
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,930
you finally reached.

376
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,350
Is that right? I'm sorry...

377
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,770
What the hell was that?

378
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,920
What was that just now?

379
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,890
A dream? A delusion?

380
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,640
No, it was real without a doubt.

381
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,350
I was in another world line.

382
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,480
But I'm not using a D-mail or the time machine...

383
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,400
No, be rational! That can't be possible!

384
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,970
It's a delusion, a daydream.

385
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,830
The memories of another world line are just making it feel like reality—

386
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,040
What a nice view!

387
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,000
Human beings are creatures who need time to unwind once in a while.

388
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,960
I have more fun working on the time leap machine...

389
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,180
It's so hot! Why is this happening to me?

390
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,020
You're too fat, Daru. You should exercise more.

391
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,170
What is this place?

392
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,730
You're so sloppy!

393
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,680
You won't survive if you continue like that.

394
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,400
Suzuha...

395
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,240
I will never forgive you.
You drove my daddy to his death.

396
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,830
I will never forgive you.

397
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,410
Stop!

398
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,600
They're getting... longer?

399
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,840
Okarin.

400
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,010
Mayuri...

401
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,470
Are you okay?

402
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,860
Yes, no need to worry.

403
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,400
I'm sorry about earlier. My right arm

404
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
went berserk against my will!

405
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,780
That's okay. I was just a little scared.

406
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,620
Oh, you're sweating a lot!

407
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,130
Sorry...

408
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:02,300
No problem. This is all Mayushii can do.

409
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,710
Lately, Mayushii's been having a recurring dream

410
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,710
where Okarin comes and saves Mayushii over and over again...

411
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,740
It's Mayushii's fault you always look so sad...

412
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,140
Mayuri.

413
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,160
It's just a dream.

414
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,680
Okarin...

415
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,090
It's nothing but a dream.

416
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,110
You're right.

417
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,450
Let's go home.

418
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,630
Okay.

419
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,410
You hugged me like this that time too.

420
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,170
Thank you, Okarin.

421
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,150
Excuse me!

422
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,650
No Cell Phones

423
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,520
Good morning, Faris.

424
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,410
Good mornyan!

425
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,290
How is it?

426
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,860
Not good, Manager.

427
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,190
Not good?

428
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,780
With this month's energy bill alone, we're already 28,568 yen in the red.

429
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,010
Should I raise the rent for real?

430
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,700
I came all the way to Japan.

431
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,040
I'd like to relax in a hot bath at least once.

432
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,590
Who is it?

433
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,550
The maid?

434
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,930
Didn't I put up the "Do Not Disturb" sign?

435
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,670
Oh? What's this?

436
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,730
Makise Kurisu.

437
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,970
I don't have time, so I'll tell you only this.

438
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,030
Who are you?!

439
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,580
Cell phone, microwave oven,

440
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,290
SERN.

441
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,250
Don't forget.

442
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,940
Don't forget, and you'll find a way.

443
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,950
As long as you continue to observe...

444
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,340
you will not fail...

445
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,230
Who are you?

446
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,150
Cell phone,

447
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,870
microwave oven, SERN?

448
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,170
What on earth was that?

449
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,660
It didn't look like they stole anything, but...

450
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,140
I'll move to another room. That was creepy.

451
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,380
What was creepy... Cristina?

452
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,180
N-Nothing in particular!

453
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,280
It's not like something scary happened to me at the hotel...

454
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,710
Never mind that! Why are you here?!

455
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,060
That's my line.

456
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:09,160
While removing the medals I amassed during my research known as "dirt,"

457
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,870
I was recalling my own accomplishments.

458
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,400
I don't wish to be disturbed!

459
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,100
Unfortunately, this is neither the lab nor your home!

460
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,170
Let me through!

461
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,530
It's not like I enjoy doing laundry with you.

462
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,830
Hey! Don't open without asking.

463
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,760
Take your stuff out when it's done!

464
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,890
Look at how ragged this lab coat's gotten.

465
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,860
Assistant, those are Daru's...

466
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,280
underpants.

467
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,700
Good thing I had some antiseptic on me!

468
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,040
Daru would be saddened if he saw the way you reacted.

469
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,500
It's because you always wear that worn-out coat that I got confused!

470
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,410
A worn-out lab coat is part of the scientific aesthetic.

471
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,670
There's a limit!

472
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,590
Look, the sleeve's torn.

473
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,550
Give it to me. I'll stitch it for you.

474
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,770
W-What?!

475
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,920
No... It's nothing...

476
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,530
It's normal to carry a sewing kit, even for me!

477
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,500
Y-Yeah, that's right.

478
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,820
This...

479
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
It's the kind of coat we use in America.

480
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
You should keep a spare.

481
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,370
It was made in the US. It should be perfect for your height.

482
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,250
Really? You bought it just for me?

483
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,310
No! It's just a coincidence!

484
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,550
I had an extra one, that's all.

485
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,120
And since you gave me that spoon and fork...

486
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,520
I'm warning you, though.

487
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,470
Don't complain about how I do it.

488
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,770
And I don't have any white thread, so...

489
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,860
Right...

490
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,360
What?

491
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,280
Nothing...

492
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,290
Is it about something that happened in another world line again?

493
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,540
Yes... And yet, not so.

494
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,170
What was that self-contradicting statement?

495
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,900
There's no doubt that thanks to my Reading Steiner ability,

496
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,260
I could observe other world lines and still retain memories of them.

497
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:38,350
And among those countless world lines that continued to converge and diverge,

498
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,890
I drifted

499
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:44,790
and miraculously reached the only one I really wanted to be on.

500
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,530
On this world line, you are sitting here with me,

501
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,370
and Mayuri is working part-time at MayQueen...

502
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,580
That's enough for me. I can't ask for more.

503
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,330
Okabe...

504
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,710
I wanted the you of this world line

505
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:06,150
to get to know more about me,
so maybe I've said more than I should.

506
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,220
I'm sorry.

507
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,610
What?

508
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,760
That's all I have to say.

509
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,510
Your hand has stopped, assistant!

510
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,650
I-I know! But...

511
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,660
I just wonder if everything you said is true...

512
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,780
It is only natural to doubt

513
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,040
the existence of world lines...

514
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,990
It's not that.

515
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,100
If countless world lines do exist,

516
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,080
I can hardly believe that only you retain memories of them.

517
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,500
That the Reading Steiner is yours alone...

518
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,260
Do you dislike that?

519
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,210
Not really, but...

520
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,170
For example, right now I'm here sewing your coat.

521
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:54,390
It shouldn't be possible, but I have the impression that it's happened before.

522
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,360
You want to say it's déjà vu, don't you?

523
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,150
I did too. But it happens so often when I'm with you.

524
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,360
Tell me, have I done this same thing in another world line?

525
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,040
I knew I did.

526
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,320
What's your point?

527
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,700
Déjà vu is considered to be

528
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,670
an anomaly caused by the overlapping of short-term memory and long-term memory.

529
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:26,380
In other words, it's a phenomenon created by a temporal discrepancy of memories.

530
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,840
Reading Steiner is the retention

531
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,130
of memories of multiple world lines generated by the alteration of the past.

532
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:40,020
Thus, both are memory anomalies created in the brain by temporal misplacement.

533
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,270
I actually just confirmed a different world line occurrence

534
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,730
based on a memory I had acknowledged as déjà vu.

535
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,250
You're saying that déjà vu is a form of Reading Steiner?

536
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,950
It may be difficult to demonstrate, but it's possible.

537
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,580
I plan to write a paper on it after I get back.

538
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,040
No matter where you go, you never change.

539
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,290
You experiment-loving girl!

540
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,460
I'll take that as a compliment.

541
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,840
Anyway, if anything happens, let me know.

542
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,050
That's—

543
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,640
Tutturu~

544
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,360
It's lunch time!

545
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,650
Mayushii, did you bring my lunch?

546
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,510
Yep.

547
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:42,710
Today's lunch is the new Juicy
Karaage Number 1 boxed lunch!

548
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,490
Didn't we have that yesterday?

549
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,800
Another invention?

550
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,540
Yup.

551
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,840
I was upgrading the Future Gadget No. 10 Cool Visitor.

552
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,380
Now it's perfect!

553
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,510
You love inventing stuff, don't you, Daru?

554
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:03,050
That's why I started the Future Gadget Lab, duh.

555
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,640
It's Kurisu!

556
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,000
What's wrong?

557
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,150
Where is he?

558
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,340
He?

559
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,890
That guy!

560
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:18,340
We were at the laundromat and all of a sudden, he was gone.

561
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,830
Like I said, who?

562
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,980
You know, that guy who's always here...

563
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,580
The founder of this lab.

564
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,740
Of this lab?

565
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,000
That would be me.

566
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,130
What?! What are you saying?

567
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,800
Oh, do you mean Ruka?

568
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,050
No!

569
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,200
Faris? Or Miss Kiryuu?

570
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,450
Not them! You know, that...

571
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,640
Right! Lab Member No. 001...

572
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,240
001?

573
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,060
001 is a vacant number.

574
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,320
We told you before, Kurisu.

575
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,530
We're keeping 001 open.

576
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,360
But...

577
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,350
Then what about this lab coat?

578
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,370
That's yours, Kurisu.

579
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,500
Mine?

580
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,370
You're right.

581
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,120
Why was I in a panic?

582
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,210
Mayushii was wondering what happened.

583
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,000
Sorry.

584
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,910
Have you gone nuts, Miss Makise?

585
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,850
I haven't!

586
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:29,910
I think that was the first moment I felt something was out of place.

587
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,900
Something was missing.

588
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:41,790
Something I thought existed wasn't there anymore.

589
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,990
It's definitely something, but...

590
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,800
I don't know what it is.

591
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,420
Something felt off, as if this world wasn't real. Like it was fake.

592
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,880
There was an uneasy feeling that something was manipulating my memory.

593
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,640
At the same time, I wondered if it was all just a delusion

594
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:09,560
and feared I was going crazy...

595
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,490
A restless urge to recall and the temptation

596
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,860
to forget everything to achieve peace of mind were clashing constantly.

597
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,120
A week later, just as that uncomfortable feeling was fading...

598
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,790
TAKING MY FORK

599
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,790
Shinichirou

600
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,120
USING MY SPOON

601
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,620
A clue emerged.

602
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,270
My fork...

603
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,950
Cell phone
Microwave oven

604
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,800
Don't forget, and you'll find a way.

605
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,090
Hello?

606
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,200
Can I ask you something real quick?

607
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm currently in my Super After-Glow State. Ask away!

608
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,390
I didn't need to know that!

609
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,200
You know about SERN, right?

610
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,460
Gulp... Why? Were you spying on my computer?

611
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,790
What do you mean?

612
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,860
How do you know about my solo hacking job?

613
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,470
Hacking?! Hacking SERN?! Why?

614
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,920
Why?! Because... Huh, I'm not sure.

615
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,570
Stay at the lab. I'll be right there.

616
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,890
Cell phone...

617
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,180
SERN!

618
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,520
That ribbon is so cute!

619
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,370
Isn't it?

620
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:34,280
Wanna try it on? I have other costumes for the next ComiMa.

621
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,520
Cosplay?

622
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,750
Interested?

623
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,880
Of course not! I could never wear something like that in public.

624
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,090
Finished!

625
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,420
Mayushii wins!

626
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,610
You beat us! But we're done too.

627
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,720
It's complete. This is...

628
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,510
This is the time-leap machine! Intense...

629
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,060
I'm not fully convinced myself.

630
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,150
But by using the LHC hacked from SERN, we can compress brain signals

631
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,950
and send them from here to the past with this Phone Microwave.

632
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,450
At least theoretically, it is feasible.

633
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,000
Well thought!

634
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,160
More like "remembered."

635
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,470
Have you made this before, Miss Makise?

636
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,800
No... I have no memory of it.

1460
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,970
But, for example, why did you decide to hack SERN, Hashida?

1461
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,500
Um, well...

1462
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,560
It kind of felt like a super-exciting thing to do.

1463
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,270
Is that all?

1464
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:51,610
Wasn't there a part of you that felt you had to do something?

1465
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:55,530
Mayuri, why do you always buy Dr Pepper?

1466
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,770
Because I always think someone will drink it...

1467
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:03,290
But neither Hashida nor I particularly like the drink.

1468
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,530
Nor do you, Mayuri.

1469
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,220
Yet you buy Dr Pepper every day.

1470
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,240
Do I?

1471
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,390
Something's...

1472
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,220
Something isn't right...

1473
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,390
Something's missing...

1474
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,390
Cell phone
Microwave oven

1475
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,240
What?

1476
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,900
I'm not sure. That's why...

1477
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,310
No way!

1478
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,780
Kurisu, are you going to use this?

1479
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,840
Right. If I'm able to use this machine to go back in time,

1480
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,900
I might seriously alter the world by changing the past.

1481
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,580
But I can't leave this situation as it is now.

1482
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,450
What do you wanna do?

1483
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,250
I'll go back to the day before I went to that laundromat.

1484
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,260
I more or less remember what I did that day.

1485
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,300
Can you go back further than 48 hours?

1486
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,220
Who said that the limit is 48 hours?

1487
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,930
Oh?

1488
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,940
Why did I think that?

1489
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:11,270
I'll act according to my memory, minimizing my impact on the past.

1490
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,950
I'll only be there

1491
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,520
to trace the origin of this uneasy feeling.

1492
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,280
But will it work?

1493
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,820
I won't push it any further if it doesn't.

1494
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,840
And I'll never use this machine again.

1495
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,500
Neither should the two of you.

1496
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,010
It's connected!

1497
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,150
Are you sure about this, Miss Makise?

1498
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,160
Hashida, please!

1499
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,100
Okay. Let's do this!

1500
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,580
Mix! Mix! Mix! Mix! Mix! Mix!

1501
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,950
Wow! Eye-contact Mix Mix Yakisoba!

1502
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,880
Oh! Nae, you can eat peppers?!

1503
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,970
I'm impressed!

1504
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,010
Yeah, but my daddy can't.

1505
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,400
Nae, Mayuri,

1506
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,270
Hashida, Faris,

1507
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:31,610
the Manager, Kiryuu, and Urushibara.

1508
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,570
Okabe!

1509
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,280
Kurisu, what's wrong?

1510
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,240
Is Okarin okay?

1511
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,040
Okabe...

1512
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,740
Why did I forget about him?

1513
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:54,510
No, I didn't forget. It was like he never existed...

1514
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:05,560
Now, as the founder of this lab I'll do the first toast of the night!

1515
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,380
Let's first make sure that everyone's got a drink, nyan~!

1516
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,010
Not ready yet? Cheers!

1517
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,040
It's like Okabe doesn't exist...

1518
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,900
Here.

1519
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,220
Can Okarin eat shrimp?

1520
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,090
Okabe!

1521
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,160
Looks like your time leap was successful.

1522
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,400
Who is this?

1523
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,430
The building on the right.

1524
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,400
In order to be able to speak to you, Makise Kurisu,

1525
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,670
I needed you to become an observer of this world.

1526
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,340
Observer?

1527
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,680
By time-leaping into the past,

1528
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,560
you were able to acknowledge the disappearance of Okabe Rintarou—

1529
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,700
Wait! Before that, who are you?

1530
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:34,240
Oh, sorry! You haven't met me yet!

1531
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,380
My name is Amane Suzuha.

1532
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,570
I came from the future

1533
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,540
with the time machine built by the future you.

1534
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,030
The time machine... I built?

1535
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,400
Yes, it all sounds hard to believe,

1536
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,540
but the Steins Gate world line is a great danger for Okabe Rintarou.

1537
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,600
His memories of other world lines

1538
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,550
are overloading his Reading Steiner

1539
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,510
and it's becoming difficult for him to remain on this world line.

1540
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,800
Then where is he?

1541
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,140
He's most likely on the "R" world line.

1542
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:16,480
It's only 0.000001% off from the one we're on now...

1543
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,130
This is the sole world line that avoids both

1544
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,300
the convergences of Shiina Mayuri's and Makise Kurisu's deaths.

1545
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,450
That's why it's more unstable than others and fluctuates,

1546
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:33,210
and there's the "R" world line just next to it.

1547
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,580
The memories of the drifting world lines

1548
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,480
overloading the Reading Steiner are causing

1549
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,800
Okabe Rintarou to pick up on that fluctuation

1550
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,680
and time-leap to the "R" world line.

1551
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:50,240
...And it's as though he never existed on this one.

1552
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,720
Is that the cause of my vertigo?

1553
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,210
Okabe...

1554
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,770
You were listening?

1555
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,560
Yes, I can hardly believe it,

1556
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,450
but if this is the word of the Part-Time Soldier, it must be true.

1557
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,700
Part-time soldier? What's that?

1558
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:12,700
No, on this world line you're neither a part-timer nor a soldier...

1559
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,140
Okabe!

1560
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,880
Okabe?

1561
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,610
I'll disappear?

1562
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,960
Yes... tomorrow morning

1563
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,950
and then you will never have existed

1564
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,940
in everyone's minds.

1565
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,110
Never existed...

1566
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,900
Powerful memories from other world lines act as triggers that cause

1567
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,860
the Okabe Rintarou observing this world line as a reality

1568
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,580
to sense these fluctuations and oscillate between lines himself.

1569
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,290
Memory cannot be controlled...

1570
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,890
That's troublesome.

1571
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,560
No matter how much we may want to forget them,

1572
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,520
memories we cannot forget remain, in spite of our will.

1573
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,930
Especially for you, Okabe...

1574
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:17,020
You experienced strong fear and sadness on the other world lines,

1575
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:22,610
and the self-reproach you felt remains in your memory too.

1576
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,570
Now you see the same people,

1577
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:30,620
the same room, the same city, and the same words from your memories.

1578
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,950
They'd be impossible to forget.

1579
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,420
Memories of other world lines, which seem like dreams but aren't...

1580
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:42,300
Memories that are real when they shouldn't be.

1581
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,530
This ambiguity turns your awareness into a risk.

1582
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:51,740
So you came from the future to save me?

1583
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,860
You could say that.

1584
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,850
The only way to save Okabe Rintarou is to go to the past with the time machine.

1585
00:47:58,650 --> 00:47:59,050
So...

1586
00:47:59,050 --> 00:47:59,890
I refuse!

1587
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,640
Return to the future at once.

1588
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,860
Then destroy the Time Machine right away.

1589
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,900
It cannot be allowed to exist. Destroy it immediately!

1590
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,860
Wait!

1591
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:17,160
I was finally able to come here with the time-leap machine!

1592
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,870
What?! Don't tell me that you... The time-leap...!

1593
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:29,320
I built it with Hashida using the cell phone, the microwave oven, and...

1594
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,840
Why did you do that?!

1595
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,390
Time-leap machines and time machines should never be built!

1596
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:37,890
Even if you can figure out how to do it,

1597
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,150
you should never ever build one!

1598
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,600
Okabe... you're hurting me!

1599
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,110
Sorry...

1600
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,110
But if I don't do something, you'll vanish.

1601
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,390
You will never have existed...

1602
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,790
I have no choice but to change the past—

1603
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,500
And what if you fail?

1604
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,220
What if it doesn't go well?

1605
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,050
The answer is simple.

1606
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:13,930
You do it again.

1607
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,840
You keep going back to the past until you succeed.

1608
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,730
As long as they have the means to go back in time, that's what people will do.

1609
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,110
But it'll only increase the suffering.

1610
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,650
A change in the past will always affect something else.

1611
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:37,120
It will never change in a way that's convenient for you.

1612
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,370
If you save someone,

1613
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,660
you will lose someone...

1614
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,210
Dreams you finally fulfilled won't exist anymore.

1615
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:48,250
Your long-held desires will be snatched away, eradicated...

1616
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,170
And when the change you hoped for doesn't happen,

1617
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,880
you will have to keep facing that inescapable reality

1618
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,960
again and again, again and again!

1619
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,140
Do you realize the pain of continuously repeating all of that,

1620
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,480
while bearing the responsibility for all those losses?

1621
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,170
Do you understand the fear of losing your humanity after it wears you down?

1622
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:13,780
But...

1623
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,780
Even if you have the means, the past must not be changed.

1624
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,660
You must not turn chance into reality.

1625
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,600
No one knows the future.

1626
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,970
It's because the past cannot be undone that people can accept all sorts of pain,

1627
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:32,090
adversity, and cruel accidents, yet still move forward.

1628
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:33,800
Then what are you going to do, Okabe?

1629
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,600
You're going to disappear!

1630
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,620
I... saw it...

1631
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,300
A world where you don't exist...

1632
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,770
A lab with only Mayuri, Hashida, and me...

1633
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,230
Where nobody remembers you...

1634
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,990
It was crueler than death!

1635
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:59,360
Any mark or meaning of your existence will disappear!

1636
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,160
I don't care.

1637
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,980
Okabe...

1638
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:14,640
All I wanted was for you and Mayuri to live in peace

1639
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,740
and keep walking towards the future.

1640
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,050
Nothing more.

1641
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,860
It's fine as long as that comes true.

1642
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,100
What you're saying now, the things you've accomplished,

1643
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,770
even your name... We'll forget everything!

1644
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,400
But Mayuri won't die, and you can keep on living too.

1645
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,090
How long will you go on following me?

1646
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,380
I'm not! I'm just going to the station.

1647
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:00,930
But your hotel's not this way.

1648
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,140
I've got somewhere to go.

1649
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,480
Where?

1650
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,850
It's my business, not yours.

1651
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,250
I'm warning you.

1652
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,090
What?

1653
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,570
The moment I disappear tomorrow,

1654
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:43,560
the people around you will think I never existed,

1655
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,010
but since you came here with a time-leap,

1656
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,920
you may still remember me.

1657
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,140
Yes... I suppose so.

1658
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,150
To a small degree, Reading Steiner is present in every human being.

1659
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,530
Since you've been leaping through time,

1660
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,070
you may experience it more than others.

1661
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,630
What are you trying to say?

1662
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,180
Forget.

1663
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,640
Forget me.

1664
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,650
Just like the others, think that I never existed.

1665
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,130
This moment was just a dream.

1666
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,930
Remembering something that no one else can is a painful thing.

1667
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,140
You can't talk to anyone about it. No one will understand you.

1668
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,680
You'll be alone.

1669
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,400
So that's how it's been for you all this time?

1670
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,660
Then...

1671
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,610
Kurisu...

1672
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,200
Then... it's no good.

1673
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,740
You have to exist!

1674
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,500
If that's what I did for you on another world line,

1675
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:05,790
then do the same for me!

1676
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,800
Stay by my side. Listen to what I say!

1677
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,040
Suffering alone...

1678
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,810
Then disappearing by yourself...

1679
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:16,730
That's...

1680
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,440
That's... That's too selfish!

1681
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,960
There's no need to worry. Daru is my right hand.

1682
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:30,810
You can rely on him in your hour of need.

1683
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:35,250
Mayuri might not look it, but she's more mature than you in some respects.

1684
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:40,670
During the hard times, you can cry on her shoulder. She'll always be there.

1685
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,380
Faris and Rukako will help you too.

1686
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,510
There's nothing to worry about.

1687
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:51,510
Stupid! That's not what I'm trying to say—

1688
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,380
You're horrible...

1689
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,500
You do something that'll leave a deep imprint in the hippocampus

1690
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:20,430
and then tell me to forget you?

1691
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,070
You're horrible...

1692
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,240
Sorry...

1693
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,580
You're horrible...

1694
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,280
Okabe didn't contact me at all after that.

1695
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,320
Neither by phone... nor email.

1696
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,300
I didn't contact him, either.

1697
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,960
I didn't know what to say to him.

1698
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,790
I couldn't say anything...

1699
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,170
I'm sure Okabe also felt...

1700
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,910
Goodbye

1701
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,910
Okabe

1702
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:32,990
Goodbye

1703
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:32,990
Okabe

1704
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:33,070
Goodbye

1705
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:33,070
Okabe

1706
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,160
Goodbye

1707
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,160
Okabe

1708
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,240
Goodbye

1709
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,240
Okabe

1710
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:33,320
Goodbye

1711
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:33,320
Okabe

1712
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:33,410
Goodbye

1713
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:33,410
Okabe

1714
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:33,490
Goodbye

1715
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:33,490
Okabe

1716
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:33,570
Goodbye

1717
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:33,570
Okabe

1718
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:33,660
Goodbye

1719
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:33,660
Okabe

1720
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:33,740
Goodbye

1721
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:33,740
Okabe

1722
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:33,820
Goodbye

1723
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:33,820
Okabe

1724
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:33,910
Goodbye

1725
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:33,910
Okabe

1726
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,400
Stupid.

1727
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,660
Stupid! Why...

1728
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,300
Why?!

1729
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,650
Now it's like I'm the stupid one!

1730
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:02,120
Being told some obscure nonsense, getting pushed around...

1731
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,690
Getting told "I love you"

1732
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,020
and not being able to forget you...

1733
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,360
At this rate, if this...

1734
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,090
Okarin!

1735
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,410
This is Dr Pepper color, isn't it?

1736
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:19,660
Yes, the very embodiment of intelligence.

1737
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,380
Requesting to see you in it, Mayushii.

1738
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,880
Silence, Perverted Gentleman.

1739
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,340
Okabe! Okabe!

1740
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,640
What was that?!

1741
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,720
There's no way I can forget you...

1742
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:46,810
Because I've known you for a long, long time...

1743
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,030
And I've loved you for a long, long time...

1744
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,780
And I will always...

1745
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,070
Always...

1746
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,120
Okarin?

1747
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,790
It's nothing... I'm fine.

1748
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,050
Kurisu!

1749
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,390
Okabe!

1750
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,050
Kurisu...

1751
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,720
Okabe, I—

1752
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,920
Mayushii! Tissue! Tissue! Quick!

1753
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,030
Y-Yes! Tissue! Tissue!

1754
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,240
There! There!

1755
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,630
Kurisu?

1756
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,710
What's up?

1757
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,450
Where is he?

1758
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,680
He?

1759
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,390
That guy... He was just there...

1760
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:01,710
Like I said. Who?

1761
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:05,590
You know... That guy!

1762
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,730
The one who's always here, the founder of this lab...

1763
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:10,790
Of this lab?

1764
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,190
That's me.

1765
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,340
Okabe... Rintarou

1766
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,180
Yes... Okabe... Rintarou...

1767
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:49,050
What's wrong, Kurisu?

1768
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,480
Did you run into a pervert?

1769
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:11,170
Hashida! Lend me your cell phone!

1770
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:12,750
What? Why?

1771
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,470
Just do it! Then hack into SERN immediately.

1772
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:17,180
Wha—?!

1773
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:17,960
Hurry!

1774
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:23,320
It's wrong! I won't accept it!

1775
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,460
No matter what you tell me...

1776
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,310
That's no good, Kurisu.

1777
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,480
Mayuri...

1778
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,750
Mayushii doesn't really understand, but...

1779
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,730
Mayushii thinks it'll only hurt you.

1780
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,980
That's when I made my decision

1781
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,020
to accept your wish.

1782
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,700
I won't manipulate time or the past

1783
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:08,760
and will accept this world you fiercely protected

1784
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:08,760
Future Gadget Lab

1785
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,810
as reality.

1786
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,770
I will forget my memories of you

1787
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,400
and the name Okabe Rintarou,

1788
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:23,180
and I'll just keep walking towards the unknown future...

1789
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,990
because that's what you wanted.

1790
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,950
Oh, Daru?

1791
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,460
You're not coming today, either?

1792
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,800
It's too hot at the lab! And there's the Rai-Net tournament today.

1793
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:42,850
Oh...

1794
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:47,250
Why don't you come too, Mayushii? Do a twin battle with Faris!

1795
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:50,270
But I'm not on shift today...

1796
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,680
See you later, then.

1797
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,570
Yeah.

1798
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:01,310
Are you ready?

1799
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,030
We will now initiate Operation Midgard!

1800
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,250
Moeka! What's wrong?

1801
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,680
He wants to talk to you...

1802
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:24,680
The Manager...

1803
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,090
In other words, there is also the theory that we still haven't reached

1804
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,640
a correct neuroscientific conclusion on why

1805
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,060
the phenomenon known as "dreaming" occurs, nor what it is needed for.

1806
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:41,480
I will continue on this subject in our next lecture.

1807
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,860
Brain

1808
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,980
Confusion

1809
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,860
Mystery

1810
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:42,980
Brain

1811
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:42,980
Mystery

1812
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:43,730
Brain

1813
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:43,110
Confusion

1814
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:43,110
Mystery

1815
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,230
Confusion

1816
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,230
Mystery

1817
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:43,480
Confusion

1818
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:43,480
Mystery

1819
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:43,610
Confusion

1820
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:43,610
Mystery

1821
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:43,730
Mystery

1822
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:44,240
Mystery

1823
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:44,360
Mystery

1824
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:02,440
I need to decide where to go for dinner.

1825
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,340
Well, we can't do anything about it.

1826
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:08,650
Are you serious?

1827
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:13,260
Mayushii tried to save her pocket money too, but it's not enough...

1828
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,640
So you're giving up? We'll lose the lab.

1829
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,480
Why are you so upset, Miss Makise?

1830
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:22,480
I...

1831
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:28,970
Lately, I've just started to feel like it's a pain to pay the rent.

1832
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,650
Mayushii didn't realize...

1833
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:34,220
I started this lab because I thought that maybe we could do something,

1834
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,870
but in the end...

1835
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:40,000
What's going to happen to Mayuri?! She won't have a place to go!

1836
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,380
Mayushii will be okay. Mayushii has the café.

1837
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,900
Mayuri...

1838
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:48,800
Actually, Mayushii was feeling the same way.

1839
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:54,770
Lately, when Mayushii comes to the lab, Mayushii gets kind of lonely...

1840
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,810
It's like...

1841
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,530
Something's missing...

1842
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:05,440
What is?

1843
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,570
The thing is... Mayushii doesn't know what.

1844
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,820
I see...

1845
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:15,890
See you, then.

1846
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:21,580
The lab won't close right away. I'll email you, okay?

1847
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,760
Okay...

1848
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,230
Cheer up, Kurisu.

1849
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:27,050
Thank you. I'll be fine.

1850
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,150
I'm going, then.

1851
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,720
Address does not exist.
\h\h\h\hThe lab might be dissolved.
\h\h\h\h To: Okabe Rintarou

1852
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:44,890
This is reality. This is the world...

1853
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:48,400
Exactly. This world line's reality.

1854
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:54,120
I thought I'd at least come to say hello.

1855
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,030
I decided to go back to the future.

1856
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:01,950
If you've decided to accept a world

1857
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:06,120
where Okabe Rintarou doesn't exist, there's no point in me remaining.

1858
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,650
I'll ask you one last time.

1859
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,090
Aren't you going to change your mind?

1860
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:19,390
There's no record of Okabe Rintarou on this world line from this point now on.

1861
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:24,690
In other words, once I go back, you'll never see him again.

1862
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:26,690
Is that still what you want?

1863
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:34,200
Okabe told me not to change the past, no matter what happens.

1864
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,240
I agree with him. The risks are too—

1865
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,750
That's not my question! What does your heart tell you!?

1866
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:46,500
I won't... change... my mind.

1867
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,960
So that's how it's going to be...

1868
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:55,340
You know, in the future, you'll build the time machine.

1869
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,300
What do you mean?

1870
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,490
Makise Kurisu develops the time machine.

1871
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:04,810
But she won't authorize its use, and will ask my father to seal it off,

1872
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:07,480
saying that it's the will of Okabe Rintarou.

1873
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:11,460
In other words, you'll keep contradicting yourself.

1874
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:16,160
You'll find a way to return to the past to help and see him,

1875
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,200
and even build the time machine,

1876
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:22,450
but you'll give up in the end because you can't be honest with yourself.

1877
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:24,660
You'll do this over and over again.

1878
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:27,000
That's why you—

1879
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:32,700
I thought that the you of the past might be more true to yourself.

1880
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:37,680
But you're still the same stubborn girl.

1881
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,220
How can you—

1882
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,470
It's the truth.

1883
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,720
I am a scientist!

1884
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,020
My actions are based on my theories and my beliefs.

1885
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:48,730
I can't be swayed by emotion—

1886
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:51,590
You always pretend to be cool-headed like that!

1887
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,190
You really get on my nerves!

1888
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,950
It's the same for me!

1889
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,700
Okabe Rintarou is no more...

1890
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,330
but the world keeps on going.

1891
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:05,830
It keeps on going as if nothing ever happened.

1892
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,000
But you'll build the time machine.

1893
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,750
What's more important to you?

1894
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:14,210
Your pride and ethical code as a scientist?

1895
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,180
Is that enough for you?

1896
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:19,270
Is there a reason for you to live in this world?

1897
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,600
This is the time machine?

1898
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,350
Let's go.

1899
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:32,830
Is it really possible?

1900
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:35,420
The future you said it was.

1901
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,810
If you change the past, the world line will shift.

1902
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:41,540
That's why you won't change any of the events that occurred,

1903
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,910
but only alter Okabe Rintarou's memory.

1904
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,370
His memory...

1905
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:48,720
Okabe Rintarou is unable to recognize the Steins Gate

1906
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,670
world line as the real world.

1907
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:55,340
So you only need to make him recognize that this world line

1908
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,260
is distinctly different from the others.

1909
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,640
That's why I have to alter his memory?

1910
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,740
Yes.

1911
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:07,820
Anchor a powerful memory that isn't present in any other world line.

1912
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:12,500
Then the present world line will be imprinted on his brain as something distinctly different

1913
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:17,530
from the others, and he will be freed from his Reading Steiner overload.

1914
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:21,530
That does sound correct in theory. True to my reputation.

1915
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:25,150
But you didn't even try to go to the past.

1916
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:26,160
Sit down over there.

1917
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,040
That was my scientist's conscience. You should be praising me.

1918
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,500
Narcissist...

1919
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,960
How rude! It's not like that, I'm just... a scientist.

1920
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,940
You're just like her. Well, you're the same person after all.

1921
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:45,270
Come on, let's go. To what year?

1922
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,360
You don't know?

1923
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,930
You should know better than me

1924
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:53,310
when the best time to plant a powerful memory in Okabe Rintarou's brain would be.

1925
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,320
2005.

1926
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,430
Based on what?

1927
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,080
Something Mayuri told me.

1928
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,820
Powerful memories are generated by powerful events.

1929
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,770
Gotcha. I'll trust you.

1930
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:11,590
Let's go! The force is a bit strong, so be prepared!

1931
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,140
Now it's up to you. You have no cell phone, so to get in touch—

1932
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:35,290
Wait! What am I supposed to do?

1933
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:38,860
I already told you the objective, but I don't know

1934
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:43,440
how to plant a powerful memory in Okabe Rintarou's head.

1935
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,030
You said you would know what to do.

1936
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,760
The future me did?

1937
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,640
Yes.

1938
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,610
I found Mayuri's address, but there was no way

1939
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:57,790
to obtain Okabe's after he had disappeared from this world line.

1940
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,790
Shiina

1941
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:02,540
It should be near this house, but...

1942
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,480
If I find him, then what?

1943
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,930
How do I talk to him? What do I do?

1944
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,190
If I fail...

1945
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:13,690
A change in the past will always affect something else.

1946
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:17,310
It will never change in a way that's convenient for you.

1947
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,390
Okabe?

1948
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:41,210
Okabe!

1949
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,630
Okabe! Okabe!

1950
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:49,550
Wait! I need to talk to you!

1951
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,100
Don't worry. The world will return to normal.

1952
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:14,290
Right... Okabe is never ever going to die there!

1953
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,060
It's all right. There's no need to worry about it!

1954
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,880
But I keep wondering... If I return to the past again,

1955
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:26,820
will Okabe get hit by a car again?

1956
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:30,340
Or perhaps an even more terrifying change will occur.

1957
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:35,400
If I interfere, something like that could easily happen...

1958
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,290
But the Okabe Rintarou of that time won't die anyway.

1959
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:41,370
Don't you understand, Amane?

1960
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,230
The fact that Okabe absolutely won't die

1961
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:47,920
also means that I absolutely won't be able to help him!

1962
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,760
But the future you—

1963
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,490
Okabe had to endure this feeling of powerlessness

1964
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,450
all by himself, all this time!

1965
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,460
I couldn't possibly...

1966
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,960
Let's see, this is...

1967
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,370
Oh, Kurisu!

1968
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:15,870
Tutturu~

1969
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:16,840
Hello.

1970
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,700
Say, is this "furniture" or "audio"?

1971
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,320
Are you throwing that away?

1972
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,240
Yeah. Daru told me

1973
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,820
to just stick the disposal ticket on it.

1974
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:28,370
I see.

1975
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,210
It's kind of sad, isn't it?

1976
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,450
Yes.

1977
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,910
But that's how it is.

1978
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,870
Listen, Kurisu.

1979
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:48,800
Do you know about... "Okarin"?

1980
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:56,390
You see, when I'm here, sometimes that word just pops into my head

1981
01:12:56,390 --> 01:13:00,080
while I'm tidying up or making costumes,

1982
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,100
or even eating...

1983
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,320
I don't...

1984
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:14,070
Kurisu?

1985
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,790
Makise!

1986
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:24,630
Urushibara...

1987
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,050
You're training hard.

1988
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:34,050
Yes. I do 100 swings a day to
unleash Samidare's true power.

1989
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:37,510
Interesting name. Did you choose it?

1990
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:38,640
Yes...

1991
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,100
No, it wasn't—

1992
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:45,560
This katana...

1993
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,690
I think someone gave it to me.

1994
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:54,570
Stop it!

1995
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:01,020
It's a virus, nyan~!

1996
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:05,250
It feels so good to get beaten up by you, Faris!

1997
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:06,710
8-0

1998
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,790
It's so one-sided.

1999
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,770
Kurisu showed up!

2000
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:14,970
What are you doing?

2001
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:17,720
We were doing a Rai-Net battle at MayQueen when

2002
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:22,060
Faris suddenly said she wanted to play against the head of the lab!

2003
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:26,270
She summoned me on my way back from a part-time job interview!

2004
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:26,900
An interview?

2005
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,610
Yup.

2006
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,740
I want to try to at least be able to pay the lab's rent.

2007
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,900
It's better if the lab exists, don't you think?

2008
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,420
Hashida...

2009
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:37,950
But something's different, nyan~.

2010
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:40,220
The head of the lab used to play...

2011
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:41,030
Better?

2012
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:45,450
No. He sucked, nyan~. Catastrophically.

2013
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:49,170
But I think he was much livelier, nyan~!

2014
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,320
Like a real battle?

2015
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,080
No, nyan~! But like...

2016
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,860
Daru-nyan, strike a pose, nyan~!

2017
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,680
Like this?

2018
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:03,640
No, nyan~!

2019
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:06,140
I think I understand...

2020
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,270
There should be one more...

2021
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,470
One more?

2022
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,440
But he's not here...

2023
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,280
Déjà vu!

2024
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:20,410
As I suspected, it's not a delusion your brain is showing you.

2025
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:23,200
Déjà vu is a manifestation of Reading Steiner!

2026
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:25,540
They're memories of another world line...

2027
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,410
I exist on countless world lines.

2028
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:31,850
The convergence of those lines and all those memories coming together

2029
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,050
makes me who I am now.

2030
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,670
A one and only me.

2031
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:39,430
Your mightily annoying self won't disappear from anyone's heart.

2032
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:43,380
Even when you think you've been forgotten, our memories of you

2033
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:44,470
will always remain somewhere...

2034
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,860
I tried to give up.

2035
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,800
I tried to forget so many times.

2036
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,300
I thought it'd be impossible, even with the time machine.

2037
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,460
But I feel like everyone is telling me not to forget!

2038
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,620
I...

2039
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:04,200
Ku-nyan? What's wrong, nyan~?

2040
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,690
I am...

2041
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:10,870
Hououin Kyouma!

2042
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:14,450
My goal is to reform this world's ruling structure!

2043
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:17,840
To accomplish this, the Future Gadget Lab

2044
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,140
must develop an invention that will plunge the world into chaos!

2045
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,240
Did the heat make you go nuts?

2046
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,250
But I've seen this before, nyan~.

2047
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:30,940
Stop it...

2048
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,720
Be silent, Supah Hakah!

2049
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,940
I am a mad scientist!

2050
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,270
That's the scenario again? Wait.

2051
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,150
What am I saying?

2052
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,980
Don't remember!

2053
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:44,570
Mayuri! The intellectual beverage of the chosen ones!

2054
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,410
Good evening... Oh?

2055
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,750
Rukako! Don't neglect your practice swings!

2056
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:49,750
Y-Yes, sir!

2057
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,560
The hidden power of the demon sword Samidare can only be unlocked

2058
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,380
through sheer discipline!

2059
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,350
Yes, sir!

2060
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,990
It's useless... I can't help him...

2061
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:04,230
Here you go, Kurisu. Your Dr Pepper.

2062
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,850
But you know, Kurisu, you aren't Hououin Kyouma.

2063
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,500
Hououin Kyouma is...

2064
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:17,610
Hououin Kyouma is...

2065
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,070
Okabe Rintarou...

2066
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:24,470
Okabe Rintarou...

2067
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:27,990
Oka... rin?

2068
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:33,000
Okarin? Sounds familiar. But my mind is still fuzzy.

2069
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,750
Okarin? Do you mean Kyouma, nyan~?

2070
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,000
...Okabe?

2071
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:41,010
Oka... Kyouma!

2072
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:45,760
Okarin... Okarin...

2073
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:49,740
I don't know who that is,

2074
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:55,480
but when I say his name, I feel warm inside.

2075
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,270
I wonder why.

2076
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:11,040
Everyone is watching something other than themselves,

2077
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,120
something important to them,

2078
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,630
just like you did when you were observing us.

2079
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:22,760
Even if you're not in this world...

2080
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,670
Even if there's no trace of you here...

2081
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,720
People's feelings will still cross world lines.

2082
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:31,990
But...

2083
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:39,710
Soon, Okabe will pass by, just like before.

2084
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:44,280
I've made it this far, but I don't know what to do.

2085
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,830
How can I save him?

2086
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:56,860
Even if our feelings cross world lines, the events will still revert back!

2087
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:58,980
Then what can I do?

2088
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:01,610
Whatever I do will be useless!

2089
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,740
Don't you have an umbrella?

2090
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,170
You're still wet! No umbrella?

2091
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:20,650
I don't know anything about Okabe.

2092
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:23,720
All I have are fragments.

2093
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,540
Slight memories from this world line

2094
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:29,930
and the ones from other world lines, called déjà vu.

2095
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:38,220
The past me would have never considered changing the past or building a time machine

2096
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,240
because there was nothing I wanted to protect that badly.

2097
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:45,550
But I finally found something...

2098
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:50,010
I still haven't told him anything about how I feel...

2099
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,850
Every time I saw him, I always acted stubborn

2100
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:57,770
and quarreled with him.

2101
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:01,230
I couldn't tell him what I really wanted to say.

2102
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:13,350
Since I was little, I've always tried to do everything on my own

2103
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,080
by building walls around me

2104
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,220
and refusing any help.

2105
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,080
An unpleasant child...

2106
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:23,110
No wonder my father didn't like me.

2107
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:29,720
But the truth is, I wanted someone to call out to me.

2108
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:32,760
I wanted someone to say,

2109
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:36,850
even if I was the only one there, "I'm here watching."

2110
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,350
Are you lost?

2111
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,340
Me too.

2112
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:13,860
A girl I've known since I was little is really depressed...

2113
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:18,230
I don't know what to say to her...

2114
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:22,860
I wonder if I'm just useless...

2115
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:39,620
Have you heard of... Hououin Kyouma?

2116
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,050
Hououin?

2117
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:47,530
He's a scientist. But not just any scientist.

2118
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:51,010
He's a mad scientist and a first-rate one at that.

2119
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:54,010
He talked and behaved crazily,

2120
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,390
and everyone always made a fool of him.

2121
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:02,620
Nobody believed what he said, in his research, or in his discoveries.

2122
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:07,150
But you know, what he uncovered was something that only he

2123
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,900
could see.

2124
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,080
He realized that it could hurt and cause pain

2125
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:16,210
and even destroy the world at times.

2126
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:20,200
So he tried with all his might to protect everyone.

2127
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,430
He continued to fight to save the world

2128
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:29,880
and managed to protect all of the people dear to him.

2129
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:34,920
But nobody ever knew about it.

2130
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:38,850
He went on being a mad scientist the entire time,

2131
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:42,920
and everybody kept on making a fool of him.

2132
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:50,980
That's a sad story.

2133
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,870
Really? I think it's a wonderful story.

2134
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,040
Go now.

2135
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:06,400
I'm sure someone is waiting for you.

2136
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:21,800
Mayuri!

2137
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:26,680
Okarin?

2138
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,690
I'm not letting them take you!

2139
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:32,460
You're my hostage, Mayuri!

2140
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:34,650
I'm going to use you for human experimentation!

2141
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:43,480
Are you ready? I will now give an overview of Operation Norn!

2142
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,730
What are you gawking at? Pervert!

2143
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:06,120
You...

2144
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:09,990
What are you doing here?

2145
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:19,220
I didn't come to you. You're trying to come back

2146
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:24,190
from this world to the Steins Gate world line.

2147
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:28,060
Remember the times you wandered through the world lines?

2148
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,520
I was always with you.

2149
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,940
Mayuri, Hashida, Faris,

2150
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:38,120
Urushibara, Kiryuu, and Amane

2151
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,820
haven't forgotten you.

2152
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:45,780
You were so arrogant to think that you were holding up the world by yourself!

2153
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,260
Don't forget.

2154
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:52,220
No matter what world line you're on, you'll never be alone.

2155
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,120
I'll find you, wherever you are!

2156
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,960
I will continue to observe you

2157
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:00,750
just as you kept on observing me.

2158
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:19,770
If that's the Steins Gate's choice.

2159
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,200
Well, Cristina, care to return it to me?

2160
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:31,160
...My first kiss.

2161
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,740
Never.

2162
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:52,550
Itsuka bokura ga mirai furikaeru toki ni wa

2163
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:52,550
Someday in the future, we will look back

2164
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:57,980
Load Region of Deja Vu

2165
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:57,980
itsumo kono basho de kimi ga waratte

2166
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:57,980
To see you smiling, always here

2167
01:26:57,980 --> 01:29:30,590
TUTTURUTUTTURUTUTTURUTUTTURUTUTTURUTUTTURU

2168
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:13,590
zankoku ni sugiyuku toki no naka de sagashimotome te i ta mono

2169
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:13,590
What I was searching for in the cruelly fast flow of time

2170
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:23,850
surechigau sekai ni tojikome rare ta me ni mie nu hikari

2171
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:23,850
An invisible light, trapped between worlds passing by one another

2172
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:35,870
tokubetsu na hodo aisuru mono he uchiakerare zu ni i ta

2173
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:35,870
I never opened my heart to the one I love - the one special to me

2174
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:47,710
sugoshi ta hibi no hitotsu hitotsu ga tomadoi o piriodo ni kaeru

2175
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:47,710
The passage of time puts an end to all my doubts

2176
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:53,880
itsuka bokura ga mirai furikaeru toki ni wa

2177
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:53,880
Someday in the future, we will look back

2178
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:59,000
itsumo kono basho de kimi ga waratte

2179
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:59,000
To see you smiling, always here

2180
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:09,030
kasaneatta minna no omoi ga sekai sen o tsukuru

2181
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:09,030
Our thoughts and feelings will combine to form a new world line

2182
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:15,350
donna ame ni mo make nu shinjiaeru kimochi

2183
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:15,350
With a belief in one another that no rain can defeat

2184
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:28,530
kono sora no kansoku sha kono sora wa ashita no shoumei

2185
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:28,530
The Observer of the sky - the sky that proves we have a future

2186
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:55,180
ano hi bokura ha deai taisetsu na nani ka o

2187
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:55,180
On the day we met I found something important

2188
01:28:55,180 --> 01:29:00,370
itsumo kono basho de sagashi te i ta ne

2189
01:28:55,180 --> 01:29:00,370
I'd been searching for a long time, and it was always here

2190
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:10,360
nanigenaku sugiyuku jikan no sono imi o shitteru

2191
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:10,360
I know the importance of time passing uneventfully

2192
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:16,690
tatoe donnani ni nin hanare te shimatte mo

2193
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:16,690
No matter the distance between us

2194
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:30,590
kono sora no kansoku sha kono sora wa ashita no shoumei

2195
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:30,590
The Observer of the sky - the sky that proves we have a future
