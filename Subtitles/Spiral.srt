00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,664
- Hey! My purse!
- Hey! Hey!

4
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,082
- He's got my purse! Stop him!
- Come on.

5
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,502
Somebody stop him! He's got my purse!

6
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,796
Police! Freeze!

7
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,343
Hey! Stop! Out of my way!

8
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,422
Get out of my way!
Out of my way! Police! Move!

9
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,555
You did not just go down there...

10
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,194
What the fuck?

11
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,404
Fuck sakes.

12
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,488
Get your fucking hands in the air!

13
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,155
I ain't gonna say it again, motherfucker!

14
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,960
Fuck.

15
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,976
Hello, detective bozwick.

16
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,850
- I want to play a game.
- No!

17
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,808
The three train
is arriving in two minutes.

18
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:00,271
It is up to you to decide
if this will be your final stop.

19
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,152
You have taken
the witness stand many times,

20
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,201
and railroaded innocent people
with your lies,

21
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,244
putting them away in jail.

22
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,907
Today, it is you who will be railroaded.

23
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,618
You have one chance fo live.

24
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,375
Tear from your mouth the tongue
that has so often been used

25
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,252
fo lie and to decejve.

26
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,708
Take a leap of faith, and you will live.

27
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,845
Only your weight will rip away
your lying tongue and save you.

28
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,590
Live or die, make your choice.

29
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,962
What you talking about?
That movie woh awards.

30
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,423
You know, Tom Hanks
is a straight pimp, man,

31
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,162
but I don't know if you could
make that movie today.

32
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,722
What the fuck you going on about?

33
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,145
- Special needs abuse.
- Special needs?

34
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,813
- What, you woke now?
- Not woke,

35
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,516
but you can't say "handicapped,"
you can't say "retarded."

36
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,102
You got to say "special needs,"
I'm trying to be respectful.

37
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,314
Forrest Gump was special needs, man.

38
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,649
What was the name of the girl?

39
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,153
- Jenny.
- Jenny.

40
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,610
He did everything for Jenny.

41
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,946
This motherfucker did some shit.

42
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,747
He jogged across the whole country.

43
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,247
He beat China in ping-pong.

44
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,293
You know how fucking hard that shit is?

45
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,791
He was a war hero.

46
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,340
Who the fuck is nicer than Forrest Gump?

47
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:31,297
His best friend was a nigga
and a white boy with no legs.

48
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,258
He made a billion dollars selling shrimp.

49
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,717
And she still wouldn't fuck him.

50
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,803
Hey, eventually, they got together.

51
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,436
Yeah, after she got aids.

52
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,393
As soon as she got aids,
she's like, "hey, forrest..."

53
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,027
Get the fuck out of here, man.

54
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,652
Giving that guy aids?

55
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,845
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

56
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,430
- That shit's abusive.
- But he ain't get it.

57
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:56,117
I ain't see no sequel. Where's gump 27

58
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,663
yo, rico just got off the elevator.

59
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,161
Oh, shit.

60
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,081
I et's do this.

61
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,555
Get down! Get down right now!

62
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,349
Get down right now!
You know what this is!

63
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,721
You know what this is!

64
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,372
That's right! Put it all!
Come on! Down!

65
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,557
Fill up this bag!

66
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,731
- Put it in the motherfucking bag!
- Come on.

67
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,023
- You know what to do!
- Chill!

68
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,021
Get back!

69
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,478
I want that coke! I want that money!

70
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,155
I want everything!

71
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,994
Shit.

72
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,413
Ninety seconds, we gotta go!

73
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,374
Freeze! Police!

74
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,578
- Hands up! Get your hands up!
- Get out of the car.

75
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,789
Get the fuck out of...

76
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,544
Zeke? Is that you?

77
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,875
/eke?

78
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,046
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You do an undercover op...

79
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,881
You don't clear it,
there's no coordination.

80
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,182
We are homicide,

81
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,635
but you're robbing drug dealers
in a fucking hotel.

82
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,018
I had a dozen 911 calls come in.
What if someone got killed?

83
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,724
That crew killed four people last week,
and we got them.

84
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,777
And we could have got more of them
if my cover wasn't blown.

85
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,229
Fuck your cover, Zeke!

86
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:57,367
You were off on your own,
as usual, no backup, nothing.

87
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:02,699
No backup, 'cause there's nobody
on the force I can fucking trust!

88
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,955
From now on, you're going to learn
to be a team player.

89
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,162
You're getting a partner.
Jeannie, send schenk in.

90
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,123
Do I look like a fucking Jamaican nanny?

91
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,835
Do I smell like jerk sauce
and baby wipes? No!

92
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,090
Me no want no partner!

93
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,047
I'm not babysitting some fucking rook.

94
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,133
Yes, you are.

95
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,014
Just because your dad
was chief fucking Marcus banks

96
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,541
doesn't mean you get out of the shit.

97
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,125
Stop making this about my father, okay?

98
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,112
He's gone, you're the head
of the department now.

99
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,517
Yeah. Drama queen.

100
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,612
Zeke, it's been 12 years.

101
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,529
Yes! Twelve fucking years.

102
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,779
Twelve years ago, I turned in a dirty cop,

103
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,360
I get a medal for it.
Big fucking deal!

104
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,161
I also got a bullet,

105
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,990
and I got to look over my back
for the rest of my career.

106
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,416
Shut up!

107
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,037
It is too fucking hot in here
for me to listen to this bullshit.

108
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,541
I got a heat wave going on.

109
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,421
We got rolling blackouts,
the city is nuts. Stop!

110
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,752
You wanted to see me, captain?

111
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,086
Yeah, come in.

112
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,716
Zeke, I want you to meet
detective in training, William schenk.

113
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,848
He was the top of his academy,
so don't screw this up.

114
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,100
Zeke is going to break you in,
show you the ropes.

115
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,807
Detective banks, it's good to...

116
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,771
Yup...

117
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,316
- Go.
- Yep.

118
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,773
Officer Harris, 1-0-3.

119
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,881
Sergeant Jones, front desk.

120
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,341
So... how do you take
your coffee in the morning?

121
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,469
Alone.

122
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,639
Okay.

123
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,859
Hey, man, I get it.

124
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,813
I wouldn't want to be
stuck with some random kid either.

125
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,863
You don't want to be my partner.

126
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,111
You don't know that.

127
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,118
Your dad's the reason for all of this.

128
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,992
He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

129
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,789
And I'm not him.

130
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,251
Prepare to be underwhelmed.

131
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,291
Banks and schenk...

132
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,249
Some homeless guy got hit
by the three train. You're up.

133
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,419
Detective Peterson,

134
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,971
pick up 2-2-1.
Detective Peterson, 2-2-1.

135
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,188
This is you?

136
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,605
Beats the squad car.

137
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,565
Detective banks en route to that 10-19.

138
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,615
Would that be north
or south side of the street?

139
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,160
- Northbound.
- Copy that.

140
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,904
What are you doing?

141
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,285
Oh, it's just family.

142
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,163
This is my wife, Emma,
this is my son, Charlie.

143
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,290
They're cute.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

144
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,962
"While it lasts?"

145
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,214
Nothing happier than the wife
of a new detective,

146
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,512
and nothing more angry
than that same bitch ten years later.

147
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,510
Maybe it's 'cause you call them bitches.

148
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,182
I'm half-Italian, trust me.

149
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,914
Women do not like it
when you call them bitches.

150
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,849
What are you telling me about women,

151
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,646
young motherfucker? Shit.

152
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,061
I just said it to you,
I didn't say it to a woman.

153
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,814
I don't say it to their face.
It's not like I'm too short.

154
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,258
We just met, but, you know,
you're firing already, I appreciate it.

155
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:25,025
I mean, all I'm saying is, you know,
most crime happens on weekends, holidays,

156
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,235
so you would think
anybody married to a cop

157
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,991
would understand this.

158
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,367
But no.

159
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,414
One day, your wife will be angry

160
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,289
'cause you couldn't go to
her sister's birthday dinner.

161
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,463
You can give a woman 600 Tuesdays.

162
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,631
It ain't worth three Saturday nights.

163
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,387
So... I'm guessing you're divorced.

164
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:55,640
Divorced, no, not yet.
I'm going through a divorce.

165
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,600
That's-that's even worse.
It's kind of like chemo.

166
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,105
Shit. Sorry.

167
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,443
Sorry for what? We're cops.
This is the life we choose.

168
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,116
Highest divorce rate,
highest suicide rate.

169
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,036
Highest rate of domestic violence.

170
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,159
Yo, when you decided to become a cop,

171
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,118
you pretty much assured yourself
you were gonna die alone.

172
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,210
My wife and I,
we're doing this counseling.

173
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,668
She's got me working on,
like, communication.

174
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,219
Counseling? Yeah, that's nice.

175
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,389
Yeah, my wife fucked the counselor.

176
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,760
Fuck, really?

177
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,308
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

178
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,969
Women cheat, too.

179
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,474
It hurts. God damn it, it hurts.

180
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,936
Women cheat, too,
but here's what happens.

181
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,238
Women cheat in the daytime.

182
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,026
You can get away with
a lot of shit in the daytime.

183
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,485
That's right. You can ride

184
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,413
- a lot of dick before dusk.
- Mmm-hmm.

185
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,751
Shit, man, I just found out
pilates doesn't even exist.

186
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,912
Wait, seriously?

187
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,376
Emma loves pilates.

188
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,208
I'm sure she does.
I'm sure she does.

189
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,168
But don't worry about it.

190
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,972
You're gonna be fine.
You gonna be married forever.

191
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,932
What do we got?

192
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,183
See for yourself.

193
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,850
Watch yourself.

194
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,871
If you're gonna throw up,
don't do it on the evidence.

195
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,998
Are you kidding me?

196
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,245
I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

197
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,586
Oh, shit.

198
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,040
You see a lot of TV sets on the subway?

199
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,213
You get everything down here.

200
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,552
Damn. Wow.

201
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,939
This bum's gonna be tough to ID.

202
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,900
I'm not too sure this is a bum.

203
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,489
I don't know a lot of bums
trying to get their steps in.

204
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,288
Whoever this is, is married...

205
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,204
And wears a fitbit.

206
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,019
This package just came in.

207
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,862
- For me?
- Yeah.

208
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,168
What is that?

209
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,871
"Play me."

210
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,324
- Okay.
- Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

211
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,514
Don't want to fuck up my computer.

212
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,560
Hello, detective banks.

213
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,484
I'm here to help reform the Metro police,

214
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:32,155
to remind them of their oath
to the people of this city.

215
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,859
One officer from your station
refused to be reformed.

216
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,695
He will not be the last to play my game.

217
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,872
If that spiral is what I think it is...

218
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,244
Jigsaw?

219
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,042
Wait, I thought
the Jigsaw killer was dead?

220
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,569
Yeah, but if it's another copycat...

221
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,337
It's gonna be a shit show.

222
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,130
I recognize that building.

223
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,004
It's the courthouse.

224
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,044
I et's check it out.

225
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,656
What are you guys doing here?

226
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,423
We thought you boys
might need some backup.

227
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,486
Fuck you, Fitch, it's not your case.

228
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,912
Yo, Zeke.

229
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,623
What do we got here?

230
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,809
What the fuck is that?

231
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,262
Is that a fucking tongue?

232
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,397
Fucking shit.

233
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,445
Four-5-3... who's 4-5-3?

234
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,753
Circle up!

235
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,753
Okay, here's what we know.

236
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,002
Dental records confirm it's boz.

237
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,546
Sorry, guys.

238
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,800
But, look, we got to catch
the son of a bitch that did this.

239
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,552
Train conductor says he didn't see much.

240
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,404
Says he saw boz hanging in the air
right before he hit the windshield.

241
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,891
Says he thinks he saw boz
bleeding from the mouth badly.

242
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,768
The package was sent
from a delivery service

243
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,771
that picked it up on a stoop
on anglin drive.

244
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,272
What about the spirals?

245
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,043
Hey, cap, obviously it's a Jigsaw copycat,

246
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,109
so that's where we got to
concentrate our focus.

247
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,441
Sure, Fitch, but I want you
to stick with hard evidence.

248
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,152
Kraus, contact the feds,
get anything they got.

249
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,704
Files, old videos, anything.

250
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,201
Do we have street images?

251
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,770
We're working on it,
but digital forensics was

252
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,474
able to map boz's movement off the fitbit.

253
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,540
Last place it was registered
was Stuart's point,

254
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,793
time-stamped during the fireworks.

255
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,737
Someone needs to call Kara,
his wife, let her know.

256
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,921
Yeah, I already called her.

257
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,137
You called Kara?

258
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,589
Yeah.

259
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,929
- Do you know Kara?
- No.

260
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,727
Did you actually talk to her,
or did you text her?

261
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,975
Let me guess, you sent an emoiji.

262
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,558
Do they have a dead husband emoji?

263
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,653
I talked to her, asshole.

264
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,480
Hey. We had to notify her
before it leaked to the press.

265
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,735
- Okay, o'brien's got point...
- O'brien?

266
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,317
This is mine.

267
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,492
Me and the rook were first on scene.

268
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,414
Banks...

269
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,289
I'm sorry, isn't this protocol?

270
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,980
Now you're part of the team again, Zeke?

271
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,090
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

272
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,762
Come on, Zeke.

273
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,932
When all you motherfuckers
were treating me like shit,

274
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,011
shooting me in my fucking back,

275
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,597
boz was my friend!

276
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,442
Boz played with my kid.

277
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,235
We went to fucking games.

278
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,028
Fuck me? No, fuck you.

279
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,028
Fucking assholes...

280
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:11,082
Zeke! Zeke, fucking stop!

281
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,336
In here! Now!

282
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,626
Zip up! Get out.

283
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,882
Okay, captain.

284
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,053
Damn, nigga, wash your hands.

285
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,139
I get why you want this.

286
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,020
Boz was my friend, too,
but you can't do this alone.

287
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,818
I need the whole department
on this, working together.

288
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,941
I'm not trying to do this alone, okay?

289
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,945
Boz is my family, man.
You gotta let me take lead.

290
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,493
You gotta let me
catch this motherfucker.

291
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,373
All right, guys,
we got a change of plans.

292
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,713
Banks is taking lead.

293
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,921
Listen up.

294
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,553
I know some of you guys think I'm a rat.

295
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,635
Some of you think I'm a snitch.

296
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,227
Some of you are mad
I fucked your mother.

297
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:25,990
Boz was last seen at the July 4th parade
at Stuart's point...

298
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,285
So there should be plenty
of surveillance footage,

299
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,613
so check your hashtags, Instagram...

300
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,448
Hey!

301
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,706
Now, we got a dead cop here,
guys, who was brutally killed.

302
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,960
A fallen brother
whose tongue was ripped out.

303
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,632
We need to focus on the case
and solve this.

304
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,553
So get the footage to detective banks
and put your personal shit aside.

305
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,589
O'brien, you good?

306
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,924
No problem here, captain.

307
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,686
Good.

308
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,728
Let's go.

309
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:05,904
Yo, where we going?

310
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,027
Pay our respects. Put on a suit.

311
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,054
Eke.

312
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,553
Kara...

313
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,051
It's okay.

314
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,474
Whoever did this, I'm gonna find them.

315
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,349
I don't understand. How did it happen?

316
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,225
Kara, your mother's on the phone.

317
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,602
Yeah, okay.

318
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,193
Eke.

319
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,028
Lisa.

320
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,447
You okay? I... I texted you.

321
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,650
Yeah, I got it.

322
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,490
Is Brian here?

323
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,117
No, my sister's watching him.

324
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,995
Sister... so, Rhonda
gets to see my son, but I don't?

325
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,044
Are we really gonna do this here?

326
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,882
No. Not today.

327
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,947
- Hey, I'm William, Zeke's partner...
- Stop.

328
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,131
Yup.

329
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,166
I'll wait outside. I'll wait outside.

330
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,896
Jamie's at the neighbor's.

331
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,476
I don't know how I'm supposed to tell him
what happened to his dad.

332
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,404
I can't imagine
what you're going through right now.

333
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,617
I know this is a bad time,

334
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,616
but I got to ask you
a couple of questions.

335
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:43,328
In the last few weeks,
did you notice anything unusual?

336
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,836
I mean, did boz say anything,
or act stressed out?

337
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,210
He was a cop, Zeke.

338
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:54,263
- So nothing out of the ordinary?
- No.

339
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,469
There was one thing, there was a black SUV
parked outside one night last week.

340
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,641
You get a make?

341
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,769
- Range rover, escalade, Lincoln?
- I don't know.

342
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,570
I told boz about it and he went out,
and he walked up, and, I don't know,

343
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:12,023
the next thing I know,
he was yelling at somebody inside.

344
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,778
Any idea what they were yelling about?

345
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,325
Did you hear anything?

346
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,575
No. If I see it again,
I'll get a license plate.

347
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,408
If you don't mind,
could you get me his devices?

348
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,915
I need to look at his iPad, laptop.

349
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,041
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Kara.

350
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,048
Nice... I gotta go, guys.
All right, be safe.

351
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,761
Eke.

352
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,885
He knew you were a good cop.

353
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,437
You find out who did this.

354
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,272
You pull a gun on your old man?

355
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,649
You out of your fucking mind?
I could have killed you.

356
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,697
What are you talking about?
I got the gun.

357
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,695
I could have killed you.

358
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,151
How'd you get in here?

359
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,452
Did you forget who the landlord is?

360
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,703
Yeah, but that doesn't give you the right
to just walk in here anytime you want.

361
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,793
Renters got rights.

362
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,918
You start paying some rent,
you can get some rights.

363
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,300
Heard about boz. You all right?

364
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,969
No, dad, I'm-I'm fucked up.

365
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,807
Sorry to hear that.
I know how close you were.

366
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:09,433
Jigsaw copycat.
That could be difficult.

367
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,857
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

368
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,107
Just, you know, being lead detective,
a lot of responsibility.

369
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,984
You got a problem with that?

370
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,191
Or are you just scared
I'm gonna embarrass you?

371
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,991
See? That right there.

372
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,241
This ain't about you.

373
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,698
You always making shit about you.

374
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:29,377
That's the shit that ruined your career
and your marriage.

375
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,454
So, now you're giving fatherly advice?

376
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,334
What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?

377
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,713
Dad. We live in the same building.

378
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,510
I saw you out front the other day,

379
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,930
you nodded at me like we were
the only two black guys in the mall.

380
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,429
We haven't had a meal together
in over a year.

381
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,852
Haven't had a meal?

382
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,931
What? Are you hungry, nigga?
You want to go get a fucking slice?

383
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,479
Let me tell you something.

384
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:57,108
My father went to work, came home.
That was it.

385
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,569
All right, I'm gonna get out of here, son.

386
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,617
I'm gonna go to Kara's, pay my respects.

387
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,745
You're gonna be all right.

388
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,575
Come over tonight, I'll order some food,
we'll go over the case.

389
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,671
Just because your dad
was chief fucking Marcus banks...

390
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,176
Stop making this about my father.

391
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,226
Twelve years ago,
I turned in a dirty cop.

392
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,686
Pete! Pete!

393
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,933
What happened? What happened?

394
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,514
He pulled a gun on me.

395
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,067
The witness pulled a gun on you?

396
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:40,481
Because there's nobody on the force
I can fucking trust!

397
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,883
I've been staring at this shit
for five hours.

398
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,805
I don't even look at porn that long.

399
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,857
Okay, I'm out. What's next?

400
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,060
Well, why don't you check
with digital forensics

401
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:21,818
and see if anybody in boz's phone log
has a black SUV?

402
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,570
My phone is dead, you got a charger?

403
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,263
Your phone's dead,
what are you, a little girl?

404
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,778
- Let me borrow your phone, shut up.
- Okay.

405
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,409
Thank you.

406
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,956
Don't drain my battery watching twilight.

407
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,001
Glad to see you joined us.

408
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,800
You think this is linked to John Kramer?

409
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,253
I sent some pictures to the feds,
we'll see what happens.

410
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,964
How are we doing on surveillance?

411
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,426
Please tell me the 20 million the city
spent on cameras got us something?

412
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Drury?

413
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,607
Yeah... street cameras from here to here

414
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,354
have already been scrubbed through.

415
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,561
Facial recognition came up with nothing.

416
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,443
There were two cameras
broken on this corner.

417
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,569
Fitch and kraus
are there now to canvas ijt.

418
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,752
No. Closed. Closed.

419
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,000
There's boz.

420
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,874
Who's that he's chasing?

421
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,709
I know that guy.

422
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,468
Benny wrights. He's a hustler.
Serious tweaker.

423
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,141
Flops in a burnt-out
bread factory down on 12th.

424
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,015
Deals with a pusher, street name speez.

425
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,892
- Should we tell Zeke?
- Fuck him.

426
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,107
I'll take the building,
you track down speez.

427
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,858
Hey, boss,

428
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,235
let me see that gun over there.
The one on the left.

429
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,487
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.

430
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,035
On behalf of the Metro police,

431
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,416
I want to thank you for your generosity.

432
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,171
I got shit to do. I'm out.

433
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,590
What's his deal?

434
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,387
He's a crooked piece of shit.

435
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,765
- Let's just call it a night.
- You sure?

436
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,141
Yeah. Go home.
Go see your wife, go see your kid.

437
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,231
What's your boy's name?

438
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,476
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

439
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,253
All right, I'll put him down.
I'll come right back.

440
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,546
No, no, no, I'm not going to be here.

441
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,652
Meeting my dad for dinner,
gonna go over the case.

442
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,739
Okay.

443
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,903
- Hey, William.
- Yeah?

444
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,822
Good work today.

445
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,114
Thanks, man.

446
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,582
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

447
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,815
Benny?

448
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,912
Wake up, Benny.

449
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,799
Rise and shine, my man.

450
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,342
Benny, come on. Get up.

451
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,262
Come on, Benny, get up.

452
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,944
You all right?

453
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,243
Fuck me.

454
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,758
This is Deborah kraus,
leave me a message.

455
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:56,849
Kraus, call me.

456
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,348
Lieutenant Tim o'brien here,

457
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,040
leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

458
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,337
Help! Help me!

459
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,488
Hello, detective Fitch.

460
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,164
I want to play a game.

461
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,583
- Hey, Zeke.
- William.

462
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:15,678
What are you doing up?

463
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,627
I told you to take
the rest of the night off.

464
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,549
It's fine, Charlie's sleeping.

465
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,639
Was sleeping.

466
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,913
Just waiting for Emma to get home,
she's having a girl's night.

467
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:27,020
Girl's night out. Okay.

468
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:30,224
You better be careful with that,
might be a dick night out.

469
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,837
Just because you're getting a divorce,

470
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,381
it doesn't mean that everyone else's
marriages have to end, too.

471
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,615
Sounds like you got your hands full.
You want to call me back?

472
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,182
Nah, it's okay, we're sleep-training.
It's a fucking nightmare.

473
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,117
Look, man...
I know you and boz were close,

474
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,868
I don't know how fo tell you this.

475
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,291
You got something to say, William, say it.

476
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,994
Well, I'm looking through
all the Metro records like you asked,

477
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,831
and boz was accused of
lying on the stand more than anybody...

478
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,209
By like a wide fucking margin.

479
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,339
Jesus.

480
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,678
The courthouse...

481
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,967
That's why the tongue
was at the courthouse.

482
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,147
Can I help you?

483
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,565
Are you Marcus banks?

484
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,734
- No, I'm his son.
- Well, terroni delivery.

485
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,981
Oh, okay.

486
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,113
Dad!

487
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,933
Pop, got your food.

488
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,822
Motherfucker!

489
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,995
How the fuck could you not call me first?

490
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,230
I tried, but you didn't answer.

491
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,916
Well, why didn't you wait for me
to fucking call you back?

492
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,547
'Cause you would have talked me out of it.

493
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,966
I told the truth.

494
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,589
Get the fuck out of my face, Zeke.

495
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,090
Can we get the room?

496
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,175
God damn it.

497
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,478
I knew I should have never
let him become a cop.

498
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,189
This shit's gonna go sideways fast.

499
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,361
He turned in a dirty cop.
Pete was a scumbag.

500
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,842
Press will make him out to be a hero.

501
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,356
And what about the other cops?

502
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,211
You think they're gonna
call him a hero, too?

503
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,444
He did the right thing.

504
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,201
You know how much
internal damage control I have to do?

505
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,031
We'll handle it.

506
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,788
We always do, huh?

507
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,462
Chief banks, wf action news here.

508
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,178
Are you in?

509
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:12,803
Oh, I'm sorry, but I think your face
was trespassing on my property.

510
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,457
Is there something I can help you with?

511
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,230
No, no.

512
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,273
All right. Fuck you very much.

513
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,169
For detective Zeke banks.

514
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,185
Banks, incoming.

515
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,682
On my desk. Right now.

516
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,140
A courier brought it.
We're holding him for questioning.

517
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,955
Hello, detective banks.

518
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:21,083
Salvation was offered,
but it was declined.

519
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,130
This fucker thinks he's Jigsaw.

520
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,503
Even got a doll this time.

521
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,461
I have a bone to pick
with the police department,

522
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,466
and if you're going to point fingers...

523
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,993
12th street bridge. I know that place.

524
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,679
You should start by
pointing them at yourselves.

525
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,351
Geez, that's two blocks away.

526
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,475
Until you come clean, many more will die.

527
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,539
Stay back.

528
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,951
Stay sharp.

529
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,055
Whoa, hold it there, guys.

530
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,533
What a sick fuck, man.

531
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,175
What the fuck?

532
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,468
Oh, no...

533
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,592
God almighty.

534
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,893
Nine-8-2.

535
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,648
It's Fitch.

536
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,099
This is detective banks
requesting backup.

537
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,479
I'm on Decker street. Request backup!

538
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,811
- Fuck him.
- In pursuit,

539
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,522
requesting backup!

540
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,334
- Fuck!
- Fuck me.

541
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,300
Okay. Putting on pressure.
You're going to be okay, stay with me.

542
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,076
You're good, you're gonna be okay.

543
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,140
You're gonna be just fine.

544
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,386
- Zeke!
- Sir! Please, please!

545
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,014
Let us do our job, come on.

546
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,749
Come on, let us do our jobs,
let's go. Let's go.

547
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,139
Where the fuck were all of you, huh?

548
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,564
My son called for backup
three times in eight minutes

549
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,486
and none of you motherfuckers
could get here?

550
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,530
Nobody? Nothing?

551
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,859
Crickets. All right,
this is what I'm going to do.

552
00:40:55,954 --> 00:41:01,665
I'm going to call dispatch
and find out who was closest available,

553
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:06,836
and when I do, I'm going to take this gun
and shoot that motherfucker.

554
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,003
We clear?

555
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,881
Fitch, it was you?

556
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,879
You fucking with my son again?

557
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,712
God damn you, son of a bitch!

558
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,423
Get off me!
You're done, motherfucker, you hear me?

559
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,008
You're fucking done!

560
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,594
Don't let me see your face again.

561
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,857
All right, call kraus,
find out Fitch's last location.

562
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,030
Hello, detective Fitch.

563
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,456
I want to play a game.

564
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,960
The tide of justice is rising around you.

565
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:52,791
In 90 seconds, the water will rise
to the height of the copper wires,

566
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,969
and if you are still in the tank,
you will be electrocuted.

567
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,139
Unless you make the sacrifice
that will cleanse you.

568
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,887
Oh... oh, god...

569
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,685
You murdered a man
because he insulted you.

570
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,014
Put your hands
where I can see them, motherfucker.

571
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,989
I said put your hands
where I can see them, sir.

572
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:19,447
Your finger pulled the trigger
and that cannot happen again.

573
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,246
Survival is simple,
but it comes with a sacrifice.

574
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,449
Bite down on the device in your mouth,

575
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,786
which will start the motor
that will rip your fingers away...

576
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,214
Leaving you free
to escape with your life.

577
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:38,216
But if you don't act quickly,
all that awaits you is this watery tomb.

578
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,797
Live or die, make your choice.

579
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,076
Hey, kraus, anything special about
the bridge where we found the fingers?

580
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,494
Yeah, why that bridge?

581
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:30,415
It was where he shot that kid,
Jimmy Lincoln.

582
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,083
Then how did you guys
find out about this place?

583
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,834
This guy, Benny wrights,
who boz was last seen with on July 4th.

584
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,131
How do you know
who boz was last seen with?

585
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,709
We took it off a pawn shop feed
in Stuart point.

586
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,010
And you didn't tell me.

587
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,638
Who the fuck did this?

588
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,933
Somebody who has it out for the Metro pd.

589
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,017
Or maybe just for Fitch.

590
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,893
You trying to say something, drury?

591
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:55,984
You know what I'm saying.

592
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,184
I doubt you'll be
shedding tears for Fitch.

593
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,689
All right, come on. Come on, Zeke.

594
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,111
Fucking asshole.

595
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,405
Okay, ignore him.

596
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,574
Did you get anything?

597
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:10,951
Got a name. Benny wrights.
Last guy boz was seen with.

598
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,829
Okay, find him,
and you got hours, not days.

599
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,166
And this is where Benny gets his meth.

600
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,623
You know what that is?

601
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,300
Is this a test?

602
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,713
- Just asking you a question.
- It's a meth house.

603
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,702
You put the money in the bucket,
the meth comes down.

604
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,967
Oh, somebody watched the wire.

605
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,184
This is some new Jack city shit. Goddamn.

606
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,818
Don't we need a warrant for this?

607
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,025
What you talking about?

608
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,320
Eke.

609
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,622
Hey, my man, my man.

610
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,270
Just trying to get a five, me and my lady!

611
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,455
It's our anniversary,
we're trying to celebrate,

612
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,786
trying to do something special.

613
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,167
Can I... can I get a five?
How about this iPad?

614
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,625
It's got everything on it.

615
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,836
I got passcodes, I got Netflix, hulu,

616
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:10,264
uber eats, postmates.
Lots of food, lots of food.

617
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,511
- Let me see that.
- Yo, man, get the fuck out of here.

618
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,176
Do I look fucking hungry to you?

619
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,041
Yo, yo, it got everything.
It don't fit, though.

620
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,100
Why don't you come down?

621
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,853
Get the fuck out of here!
Come back when you get some money!

622
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,230
Okay, okay. I need money, I need money.

623
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,465
No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

624
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,591
I got some, I got some money.

625
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,105
I got some money, hold up a second.

626
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,656
Hold up a second, all right?

627
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,364
All right, send it down, baby.

628
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,946
Come on, come on, let's do this.

629
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,585
Can't wait!

630
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,997
- Zeke, what the fuck?
- We've got ten seconds, come on!

631
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,164
Jesus Christ.

632
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,636
What the fuck?

633
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,635
- Move!
- Get out of the way.

634
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,718
Out of my way, out of my way! Police!

635
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,927
Five-o!

636
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,388
- Everybody, five-o!
- Move, move, move! Come on!

637
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,517
Go! Coming through.

638
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,688
Fucking cops, man.

639
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,102
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

640
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,982
Shit! Get your dog!

641
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,359
- Fuck you, man.
- Get your fucking dog!

642
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,199
- Now!
- Hey, be nice.

643
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,199
Jesus Christ.

644
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,826
Holy fucking shit.

645
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,742
- What the fuck's going on?
- Back inside. Get back inside.

646
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,299
Hide your shit!

647
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:36,478
Come on!

648
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,313
Fuck. Fuck!

649
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,485
Fuck! My fucking leg!

650
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,487
Why do you make this shit so hard?

651
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,193
What if I really wanted
to get fucked up?

652
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,119
- Motherfucker...
- You got to make it easy

653
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,163
for the customer, skeeve!

654
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,581
My fucking leg!

655
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:04,333
That leg is fucked up.

656
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,538
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

657
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,965
Let me get a shot for the gram.
Hold on for one second.

658
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,963
- What the fuck?
- Hold on, hold on.

659
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,419
My man.

660
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,051
Here we go! You want me to tag you?

661
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,349
- Fuck... fuck you.
- Can I tag you, motherfucker?

662
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,392
- You see this man before?
- I ain't telling you shit!

663
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,003
Why, 'cause you're worried about
that bone sticking out your leg?

664
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,563
Why don't you let me sterilize it?

665
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:31,023
No... no... no! Fuck!

666
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,536
It's Benny! Stop, please!

667
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,864
Everybody knows that
motherfucker Benny wrights!

668
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,792
He's one of my best customers, man.

669
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,120
When was the last time you saw him?

670
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,734
I ain't seen the bitch in two days, man.

671
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,591
Word on the street is that mother...
Motherfucker od'd.

672
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,755
- Fuck this snitch.
- Fuck!

673
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,510
Well, that was a waste of time.

674
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,721
Well, we know Benny's dead.

675
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:06,228
Meth isn't the type of thing
you take a break from.

676
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,978
Besides, you see that device?

677
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,563
That was not designed by anybody
with rotten teeth.

678
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,320
Well, what do you think about
this whole Jigsaw angle?

679
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,764
You think it's a, what-do-you-call-them,
one of those disciples?

680
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,404
John Kramer didn't target cops.

681
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:24,162
Whoever did this has another motive.
Something personal.

682
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:28,087
And they're not following orders,
especially the orders of a ghost.

683
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:32,759
Ghost or not, somebody's out there
pulling all the strings.

684
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,252
You think this guy sent you the boxes

685
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,950
because you're the lead detective
on the case,

686
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,009
or because you're you?

687
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,385
I don't know.

688
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,969
Well, you got any enemies?
That aren't cops?

689
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,390
I don't know why she
won't give me another chance.

690
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,063
I don't know,
maybe it's because you beat her

691
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,519
when you drink too much.

692
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,070
You ever think of that?

693
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,649
That's some tough love.
Who the hell is this guy?

694
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:02,535
Ex-cop. Partner snitched on him,
had to do nine years hard time.

695
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,705
The system spit him out, now here he is.

696
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:11,633
Hey, Pete.

697
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,508
Eke.

698
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,017
Last guy I expected to see here.

699
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,388
You trying to get sober?

700
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,471
Alcohol's not my problem.

701
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,476
The glass and the bottle can kill.

702
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,645
How you doing, Pete?

703
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,487
Eighteen months sober,
living in a church basement,

704
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,811
who could ask for anything more?

705
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,531
Who's this?

706
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,624
Detective schenk.
We're working a case together.

707
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:41,743
Working together?

708
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,430
Don't let this guy catch you jaywalking,

709
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,101
or he'll stab you
right in the fucking back.

710
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,162
Don't forget, Pete, you gave me the knife.

711
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,165
You're right, I did.

712
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:53,043
And you witnessed this cop
throw the victim off a rooftop?

713
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,840
And you saw it,
I mean, with your own eyes?

714
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,044
And you can positively ID this cop?

715
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,698
He's had his foot on the neck
of this community for way too long.

716
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,098
We can't have this.

717
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,552
I'll testify, officer dunleavy.
I'l do it.

718
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,232
Pete! Pete! What happened? What happened?

719
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,484
He pulled a gun on me.

720
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,610
The witness pulled a gun on you?

721
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:27,449
I was mad for a long time,
but now I take responsibility.

722
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,249
I should have never pulled the trigger.

723
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,916
The guy had a family.

724
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,589
It was crazy back then, right?

725
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,257
We were working under article 8.

726
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:40,673
We were out of control.

727
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,847
Cops were given their own discretion
to crack down on crime.

728
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,721
Where were you July 4th at 9:30 P.M.?

729
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:51,435
Really? That's what you're here for?

730
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,561
That's what I'm here for.

731
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:57,019
Look, some guy came to a meeting drunk

732
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,571
and wanted to fight a sponsor,
so I hit him.

733
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,023
Knocked him clean out.

734
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,741
Anyway, the cops came.
I'm still on probation,

735
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,444
but lucky for me, it was o'brien.

736
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,622
He let the whole thing slide
because, you know...

737
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,372
Loyalty.

738
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:14,457
Loyalty.

739
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,876
Take care, Pete.

740
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,666
God loves you, Zeke.

741
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,090
More than you.

742
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,913
Can't believe that guy used to be a cop.

743
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,267
He shot an innocent guy,
but you turned on him?

744
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,317
There's a code, and you better
learn how to follow it,

745
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,003
or you're going to spend
the rest of your life watching your back.

746
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,855
Fair point.

747
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,792
Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

748
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,533
[Eave a message.

749
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:52,241
Yeah, dad, I'm at your apartment.
I was here last night.

750
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,452
It doesn't look like you've been home.

751
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:00,753
All right, give me a call.

752
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,942
You've gotten through to William,
leave a message after the beep.

753
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,362
Schenk; It's 9:00 A.M.,
where the fuck are you? Give me a call.

754
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,739
Just tell me what happened, okay?

755
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,819
Hey! Hey! Hey!

756
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,198
Put the box on the ground!

757
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,450
On the ground! Hands up! Hands up!

758
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,033
On the ground now! Hands up, hands up!

759
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,164
Don't move!

760
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,216
Get him out of here.

761
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,253
Take him to holding.

762
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,257
I'm sorry, banks, he blew right past me.

763
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,394
No way, Zeke, that one is not the same.
I'm calling the bomb squad.

764
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,436
Angie, you're the head of the department.

765
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:57,060
We got two dead cops, there's no time.

766
00:53:58,861 --> 00:53:59,976
Get everybody out.

767
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,402
Everybody out! Everybody out!

768
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,445
Everybody, go!

769
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,797
Is that fucking skin?

770
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,886
"Am I getting under your skin,
detective banks?

771
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:35,436
Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

772
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,392
I'll take your head."

773
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,190
"I'll take your head..."

774
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,690
"Am I getting under your skin...

775
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,066
Am I getting under your skin...

776
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,648
Am I getting under your skin...?"

777
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,202
Family. This is my wife, Emma,
this is my son, Charlie.

778
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:04,502
What the fuck is that?

779
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,324
Captain, there's something under here.

780
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,179
Constantine paints.

781
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,253
Thanks, yeah.

782
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,337
Follow me.

783
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,176
How do you know about this place?

784
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,388
Zeke, how do you know about this place?

785
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,137
My dad used to take me here.

786
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,684
Watch your step, gentlemen.

787
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,352
It wasn't always a butcher shop.

788
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,940
Used to be constantine trains.

789
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,893
Like a hobby shop.

790
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,204
Oh, my god.

791
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,723
Anything?

792
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,683
Well, we're analyzing the tape recording.

793
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,564
Hello, detective schenk,

794
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,395
I want to play a game.

795
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:54,324
You were head of your class
at the police academy...

796
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,117
He was obviously skinned...

797
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,283
Postmortem.

798
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,852
Your dad's the reason I wanted
to do this in the first place.

799
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,116
The body was scored first

800
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:07,671
to remove the pieces in larger strips,
arms, neck, as he ripped the skin...

801
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:11,876
Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

802
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,803
Given the defensive wounds,
he clearly tried to fight back,

803
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,721
which explains the deeper gashes.

804
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,147
Captain, over here.

805
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,974
Is it a serial killer targeting cops?

806
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,856
Is the victim inside a policeman?

807
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,307
No comment. Commissioner hart
will make a statement tonight.

808
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,028
We got to try to keep his identity
out of the press until I tell his wife.

809
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,833
"Am I getting under your skin,
detective banks?"

810
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,351
Hey, o'brien.

811
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,445
Yeah, boss?

812
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,530
You seen Zeke?

813
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,238
No, not for a while.

814
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,761
Okay, I'm heading down to cold case.

815
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,275
Copy that, captain.

816
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,115
I need all available units,
officer down 3rd and beaman.

817
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,371
Please report, 3rd and beaman.

818
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,559
What do we got?

819
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,889
I was writing a ticket
and some guy in a pig's mask,

820
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,128
he runs up on me with a knife.

821
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:52,143
So, he stabs your arm and just takes off?

822
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,977
I fought him off
the best I could and he...

823
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,072
He took off running.

824
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:58,194
Is there any reason
he would have to attack you?

825
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:01,618
No. He just wanted to mess with the cops.

826
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:05,664
"Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

827
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,082
I'll take your head."

828
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,501
Angie, you're the head of the department.

829
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:10,748
Angie...

830
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:12,420
Fuck!

831
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,043
Angie! Pick up!

832
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,386
Hey, you've reached captain Angie garza,

833
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:24,957
leave a message aft the tone. Thanks.

834
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:34,689
Angie, get to the bullpen!
He's coming for you!

835
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,115
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

836
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:47,952
Shit!

837
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,835
Hey! Hey! Hey!

838
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,974
Hello? Hello! Shit!

839
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:09,738
Help!

840
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,117
Hello, captain garza.

841
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,827
I want to play a game.

842
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,379
You have covered up corruption
in your department,

843
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,082
never sticking your neck out
for the innocent.

844
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,510
Now, the cover-up will be on you.

845
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:28,557
In a few seconds, boiling hot wax
will be coming out of the pipe above you.

846
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,680
The only way to stop yourself
from being suffocated

847
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:35,605
is to sever your spinal cord
with the blade beneath your neck,

848
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,228
which will stop the wax.

849
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,684
You cannot walk away,

850
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,359
but you can survive.

851
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,278
Live or die, make your choice.

852
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,528
Fuck you!

853
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,373
Angie! Angie!

854
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,375
Get the fuck out of the way!

855
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,168
How come no one is answering the phone?

856
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:19,232
An officer was attacked,
it's fucking chaos in here.

857
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:22,314
Angie! Angie!

858
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,409
Angie?

859
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,777
- Zeke, what's going on?
- He's got her!

860
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:31,987
Who's got her?

861
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,993
The killer has Angie!

862
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,938
I guess you didn't hear, the killer
just attacked a cop at 3rd and beaman.

863
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:40,420
That was just a diversion
to get us out of the precinct.

864
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,122
She's down in the fucking basement!

865
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:53,887
Did you find Angie?

866
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,015
In the basement, in the basement!

867
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:59,348
Captain Angie garza, call the front desk.

868
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,916
Open it!

869
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,124
Hurry up!

870
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,494
Angie!

871
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,920
Open it!

872
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,008
Okay.

873
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:29,555
Shit!

874
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:35,259
It's okay, it's okay.
It's gonna be fine.

875
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,353
Oh, my god.

876
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,440
It's okay.

877
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,486
It's okay... oh...

878
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,578
I ock it down.

879
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,287
You understand me? Lock it down.

880
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,544
Nobody gets out of this precinct.

881
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,503
I need all the footage from the cameras
in the evidence room.

882
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,843
Okay, here...
Here's when the call came in,

883
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:58,391
but then there's nothing
until you come in.

884
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:03,643
You see right there,
it jumps from 13:11 to 13:24. Glitch?

885
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,223
No, there's no glitch,

886
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,463
because look, on the first frame,
the safe door is open,

887
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:08,818
but on the next, it's shut.

888
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,190
There's 13 minutes missing.

889
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:13,318
Access to this footage,
is that through the computer system?

890
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,054
Yeah, we just need
a badge number and a password.

891
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:16,739
I can't tell you who deleted the video,

892
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,697
but I can access who logged into
the server over the past day.

893
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:23,825
O'brien, tupper, nicholazi...

894
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,287
Wait, who's badge number 2-1-3?

895
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,168
Pete dunleavy, my old partner.

896
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,250
Dunleavy? He shouldn't have access.

897
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,505
How long's it been
since he was even on the job?

898
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:35,806
Where you going?

899
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,300
To pay Pete a visit.

900
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:39,348
Zeke, he's not the only one!

901
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:40,971
Your father had access, too.

902
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:42,848
The location of schenk's body,

903
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,959
you said it was where
your father took you as a kid.

904
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:47,224
When was the last time
you saw your father?

905
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,311
- This morning.
- Bullshit.

906
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,988
Motherfucker!

907
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,110
What the fuck, Zeke?

908
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,691
Fuck you, man!

909
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,822
- Fuck you!
- Get the fuck out of here!

910
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,074
- Get him out of here!
- Fuck you! You're too close!

911
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,873
You're too close to this thing, Zeke.

912
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,549
Petel

913
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:19,850
petel

914
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,102
petel

915
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,684
[Eave a message.

916
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:36,819
Dad, I've called you three times,
please call me back!

917
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:40,402
People are asking questions,
and I'm sick of making excuses.

918
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,829
You got something to tell me? Fuck!

919
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,389
You wanna play games, motherfucker?

920
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,608
All right, I'll play.

921
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:36,505
You okay?

922
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:40,916
Hey!

923
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,424
Help!

924
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:26,907
Pete?

925
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:30,032
Pete, wake up.

926
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,234
Petel

927
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,412
what? Zeke? Fuck.

928
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,077
Get me the fuck down, Zeke.

929
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:42,666
Come on!

930
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,122
You hacked the computer.

931
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,876
You erased the surveillance footage.

932
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,573
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Zeke.

933
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,337
- Did you kill Angie?
- What?

934
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,718
- Did you kill boz?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

935
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:57,052
- Did you kill boz?
- Boz? Fuck...

936
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,637
What the fuck is with you, Zeke?
Get me the fuck out of here!

937
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,269
Is this some sick fucking revenge, Zeke?

938
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,351
Putting me in jail isn't enough, huh?

939
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,776
Get me the fuck out of here!

940
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,245
Hello, detective banks.

941
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,244
I want to play a game.

942
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,247
When Peter dunleavy
murdered an innocent man,

943
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,954
your career was shattered like glass.

944
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:29,713
Can you stand on the sidelines
while justice is finally served?

945
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,544
There is a way to save him,

946
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:35,552
or you can keep him locked up
and throw away the key.

947
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:37,474
The decision is yours.

948
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:39,894
"Throw away the key," what the fuck?

949
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,061
Huh?

950
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,438
Fuck.

951
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:48,690
Eke.

952
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,450
Get me the fuck out of this thing.

953
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,450
Eke.

954
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,082
Oh, shit.

955
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,168
Come on, Zeke.

956
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,329
Get me the fuck out of here, Zeke!

957
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,641
Shit!

958
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,191
Zeke! Help me!

959
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,909
/eke?

960
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,318
Get me out, come on, man.

961
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,391
/ekel

962
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,563
/ekel

963
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,811
or you can keep him locked up

964
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,563
and throw away the key.

965
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,613
Petel

966
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:29,923
I'm coming, Pete!

967
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,272
Shit.

968
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,599
Fuck. I got you, I got you.

969
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:54,739
Come on, Pete.

970
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:01,406

972
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:13,270
You disloyal piece of shit.

973
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,031
I've been loyal to you
since the first day we met.

974
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,526
Fifteen years ago.

975
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,696
The day your partner killed my father.

976
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:34,420
So, Charlie, you saw this cop
throw the victim off a rooftop,

977
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,714
and you can positively ID this cop?

978
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:38,962
I'll testify, officer dunleavy.

979
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:40,088
I'll do it.

980
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:52,479
Pete! Pete!
What happened, what happened?

981
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,067
He pulled a gun on me.

982
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,975
The witness pulled a gun on you?

983
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,655
Shh.

984
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,778
Pete killed Charlie emmerson.

985
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,825
What? You thought I'd use my real name?

986
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:09,497
Do you have any idea how hard it was
to get placed in this department,

987
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,869
to get assigned to be your partner?

988
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,834
What about your family,
what about your son?

989
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,506
This is my son, Charlie.

990
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,381
I don't have a son.

991
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:26,558
Charlie's sleeping...

992
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:28,598
Was sleeping.

993
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:31,428
After Benny wrights led boz
down the subway tunnels...

994
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,314
I tattooed my dad's name on his arm.

995
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,645
Where is my father?

996
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,104
You'll see him soon.

997
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,939
Where the fuck is my father?

998
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:46,821
I didn't even ask him
to come down here. You did.

999
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,994
- Let me borrow your phone, shut up.
- Okay.

1000
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,537
Thank you.

1001
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,706
Don't drain my battery
watching twilight.

1002
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,686
Where is he?

1003
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,310
- Don't you want to hear my offer?
- Do I have a choice?

1004
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:19,437
I want to be partners.

1005
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,938
You took a stand, Zeke,
against a dirty cop,

1006
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,113
and what did it get you?

1007
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,199
A lifetime of watching your back,
working alone.

1008
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:34,373
Getting the call for every homeless bum
who turns up dead.

1009
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,062
I mean, let's be real,
some of these motherfuckers

1010
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:37,701
are straight up evil.

1011
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,627
Fitch not backing you up...

1012
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:40,750
Fuck him.

1013
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,753
He won't repeat that mistake.

1014
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,421
And boz, always lying under oath...

1015
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,137
But you, you're different.

1016
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,889
You're Metro's finest.

1017
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:56,887
That's why I want to team up
with you on this.

1018
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,564
You find the dirty cops,
and I'll take care of the rest.

1019
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,064
You want me to help you kill cops?

1020
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,942
No, fuck no. Just the bad ones.

1021
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:09,446
John Kramer was right, the spiral.

1022
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:14,326
A symbol of change, evolution, progress.

1023
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:18,455
But why limit that to an individual
when you can apply it to a whole system?

1024
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,786
You got shot for doing the right thing.

1025
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,291
Let's face it, these cops?

1026
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:23,735
They're not going to clean up
on their own.

1027
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:28,048
But we take a tongue here,
a few bones there, they'll come around.

1028
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,756
We're going to fix
a broken department. Okay?

1029
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,181
You and me.

1030
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,269
Okay.

1031
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:36,646
Okay.

1032
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,474
I et's do it.

1033
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:41,932
I want to trust you. I do.

1034
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,894
I'm in. But my dad goes free.

1035
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,367
One second.

1036
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,740
911, please state your emergency.

1037
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,824
Hello, I'm at the old soap factory
on madigan Lane.

1038
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:01,502
There's a crazy guy with a gun
he's firing it everywhere. Please hurry!

1039
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,169
What the fuck was that?

1040
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,043
You better hurry, Zeke,
SWAT's on the way.

1041
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,591
Look, I want to believe you, I do.

1042
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,174
I want to trust you.

1043
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:15,007
Take this, you'll need it. Come on.

1044
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,177
Let's go see your dad.

1045
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,064
It's time for your final test.

1046
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,252
Dad.

1047
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:42,663
Ezekiel.

1048
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,086
Oh, shit! Get him down!

1049
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:50,668
Oh, shit.

1050
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:54,971
I got you, dad.

1051
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,515
Zeke. Help me, son.

1052
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,474
Don't worry, don't worry.

1053
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:04,477
I'm not going to let you die.
I will get you down.

1054
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,899
All right, just hold on.

1055
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,026
Shoot this motherfucker right now.

1056
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:16,486
Get him down! Get him down now!

1057
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:19,704
I thought we were partners.

1058
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,578
You going to shoot me, Zeke?

1059
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:23,454
With your one bullet?

1060
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,831
It's a bad idea. It kills your dad.

1061
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:30,045
He took a shot at me, by the way.

1062
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,502
Missed. I wasted four.

1063
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,258
That means you got one shot left, Zeke.

1064
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:41,185
All right, cops are here.
That gives us four minutes.

1065
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:43,831
Do you know there's 1.5 gallons of blood
in the human body, Zeke?

1066
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,269
At the rate your old man is bleeding out,

1067
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:53,231
in just three minutes,
those jars will be full

1068
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,031
and your dad will be dead.

1069
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:57,693
The only thing that can set him free

1070
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:01,121
is the bullet in your gun
fired at that target.

1071
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,866
Either way, I've got
a foolproof way out of here.

1072
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:06,712
You're not Jigsaw.

1073
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:08,464
That's the game.

1074
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:12,298
Shoot me and you both lose.

1075
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:14,468
Shoot the target and we both win.

1076
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:18,839
- You want to play?
- I'm dying, Zeke, end it now.

1077
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,558
We're in maintenance corridor.

1078
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,601
Roger that.
I just breached southwest entrance.

1079
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:26,225
Going through the south door.

1080
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:30,267
Nothing here. Keep moving.

1081
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:31,522
I need you all in.

1082
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:35,276
Dunleavy ruined both our lives,
and you tried to help that piece of shit?

1083
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,528
- Zeke!
- Pete!

1084
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,405
You failed that test.

1085
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,376
Now I need you to choose
who you're really with.

1086
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:45,491
The man who corrupted the force,
or the one who's trying to save it.

1087
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:46,706
You want to tell him, chief?

1088
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,412
Tell me what?

1089
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:53,749
Tell him about all the fucking shit
you did under article 8.

1090
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,001
What's he talking about?

1091
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,052
- Time's running out.
- What's he talking about?

1092
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,223
Citizens were dying.

1093
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,973
We did what we had to
to clean up the streets.

1094
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,803
It was crazy back then, right?

1095
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:10,107
We were working under article 8,
we were out of control.

1096
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,273
Murder rate went way down.

1097
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:16,321
That's fucking bullshit.

1098
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,069
People felt safe again.

1099
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,651
The streets got cleaner
because the cops got dirtier.

1100
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,348
Your dad oversaw the whole thing,
by the way.

1101
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,409
Innocent people getting shot,
all in the name of justice.

1102
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:28,709
Article 8 was one of the most corrupt
police policies in history,

1103
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:30,440
and guess who was
your dad's right-hand man?

1104
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,250
Sorry, or should I say woman,
the whole time?

1105
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:35,048
We'll handle it. We always do, huh?

1106
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,592
- Angie?
- Angie!

1107
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,839
It was Angie.

1108
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:40,467
I mean, not a massive surprise.

1109
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,343
You think it was her stellar reputation

1110
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,265
that got her a precinct at age 357
come on.

1111
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:47,311
Shoot this piece of shit, Ezekiel. Now.

1112
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,125
Yeah, that's right,
because that's what cops do.

1113
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:50,469
Shoot first, ask questions later.

1114
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,687
You watched my father die
and I'm trying to save yours.

1115
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:59,899
If we're going to trust each other,
I need you to do this.

1116
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,405
Ezekiel...

1117
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:06,364
You've always done the right thing,
do it now.

1118
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,620
This piece of shit is killing cops.

1119
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:15,123
You still need to decide,
you can shoot me, or...

1120
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:16,916
Or you can save your dad.

1121
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:19,964
Clock's ticking, man.

1122
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,340
Think fast.

1123
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:23,926
Cavalry's coming.

1124
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,303
But not in time to do
any favors for your old man.

1125
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:27,555
Only you can do that.

1126
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,358
Dad? Dad? Oh, my god.

1127
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:39,448
Shots fired!

1128
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:50,494
Eke... Zeke.

1129
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:52,753
It's going to be okay.

1130
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:56,001
He's getting away.

1131
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,082
Don't let him get away.

1132
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,801
Go... go!

1133
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,862
Stop. Don't come in.

1134
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,029
Don't come in.

1135
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,793
Whoever did this has another motive,
something personal.

1136
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,094
Whoever did this...

1137
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,182
They're pulling all the strings.

1138
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,729
Your dad is the reason for all of this.

1139
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,585
He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

1140
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,769
I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

1141
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,316
What the fuck's going on?

1142
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:12,163
Go, go, go!

1143
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:15,622
- Get down! Get down now!
- Let me see your hands!

1144
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:17,661
No! No, no, stop!

1145
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:18,962
God!

1146
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:20,539
- Freeze!
- No, no!

1147
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:24,964
Nol

1148
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:26,215
put it down!

1149
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,009
Lower your weapon!

1150
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,101
Fire!

1151
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:55,911
Nol
