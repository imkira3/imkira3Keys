NARRATOR: Every Who down in Who-ville
liked Christmas a lot.

3
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,679
But the Grinch...

4
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:24,227
...who lived just north of Who-ville,
did not.

5
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:30,483
The Grinch hated Christmas,
the whole Christmas season.

6
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:35,154
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

7
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,825
It could be perhaps
that his shoes were too tight.

8
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,162
It could be his head
wasn't screwed on just right.

9
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,791
But I think that
the most likely reason of all...

10
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,880
...may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.

11
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,050
But whatever the reason,
his heart or his shoes...

12
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:01,848
...he stood there on Christmas Eve
hating the Whos.

13
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:07,270
Staring down from his cave
with a sour Grinchy frown...

14
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,440
...at the warm lighted windows
below in their town.

15
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,986
For he knew every Who
down in Who-ville beneath...

16
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:19,198
...was busy now
hanging a holly Who-wreath.

17
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,701
And they're hanging their stockings.

18
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,662
He snarled with a sneer.

Tomorrow is Christmas.
It's practically here.

20
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:34,547
Then he growled,
with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming:

21
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:40,428
I must find some way
to keep Christmas from coming.

22

And then... Oh, the noise. Oh, the noise.
Noise, noise, noise.

25
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:02,325
There's one thing I hate. All the noise.
Noise, noise, noise.

NARRATOR: And the more the Grinch
thought of this Who-Christmas sing...

51
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,018
...the more the Grinch thought:

52
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,021
I must stop this whole thing.

53
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,025
Why, for 53 years,
I've put up with it now.

I must stop Christmas from coming.

But how?

56
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:37,790
Then he got an idea. An awful idea.

57
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:44,213
The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea.

58
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,678
GRINCH:
I know just what to do.

59
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,721
The Grinch laughed in his throat.

60
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:58,060
GRINCH: I'll make a quick Santy Claus
hat and a coat.

61
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,271
Then he chuckled and clucked:

62
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:04,066
GRINCH:
What a great Grinchy trick.

63
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:10,072
With this coat and this hat,
I'll look just like Saint Nick.

64
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,759
All I need is a reindeer.

65
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,177
The Grinch looked around.

66
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,430
But since reindeer are scarce,
there was none to be found.

67
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:20,476
Did that stop the Grinch? Ha.
The Grinch simply said:

68
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:25,397
GRINCH: If I can't find a reindeer,
I'll make one instead.

69
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,694
So he took his dog, Max,
and he took some black thread...

70
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,240
...and he tied a big horn
on the top of his head.

71
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,263
Then he loaded some bags
and some old empty sacks...

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,059
...on a ramshackle sleigh,
and he whistled for Max.

...toward the homes where the Whos lay
a-snooze in their town.

All their windows were dark.
No one knew he was there.

All the Whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care...

on the square.

This is stop number one.

The old Grinchy Claus hissed as he climbed
to the roof, empty bags in his fist.

83
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,339
Then he slid down the chimney.
A rather tight pinch.

84
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,676
But if Santa could do it,
then so could the Grinch.

85
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,513
He got stuck only once,
for a minute or two.

86
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,516
Then he stuck his head out
of the fireplace flue...

87
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:52,312
...where the little Who stockings
hung all in a row.

These stockings...

- Are the first things to go.

with a smile most unpleasant...

...checkerboards, bizzel-binks,
popcorn and plums.

95
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,756
Then he stuffed them in bags.
Then the Grinch, very nimbly...

- There's a light on this tree
that won't light on one side.

Then he patted her head.

And he got her a drink,

And the last thing he took
was the log for their fire.

On their walls, he left nothing
but hooks and some wire.

154
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:22,113
But this sound wasn't sad.

155
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,785
Why, this sound sounded glad.

156
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:33,416
Every Who down in Who-ville,
the tall and the small...

157
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:38,380
...was singing without any presents at all.

158
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:43,843
He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming,
it came.

159
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:50,558
Somehow or other, it came just the same.

160
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:55,730
And the Grinch,
with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow...

161
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,234
...stood puzzling and puzzling.

162
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:03,989
How could it be so?
It came without ribbons.

163
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,076
It came without tags.

164
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,957
It came without packages, boxes or bags.

165
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:19,170
He puzzled and puzzed
till his puzzler was sore.

166
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,799
Then the Grinch thought of something
he hadn't before.

167
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:28,513
"Maybe Christmas," he thought,
"doesn't come from a store.

168
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:34,769
Maybe Christmas, perhaps,
means a little bit more."

169
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:24,360
And what happened then?
Well, in Who-ville they say...

170
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:30,742
...that the Grinch's small heart
grew three sizes that day.

171
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,706
And then the true meaning of Christmas
came through.

172
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:42,504
And the Grinch found the strength
of 10 Grinches plus two.

173
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,883
And now that his heart
didn't feel quite so tight...

174
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,261
...he whizzed with his load
through the bright morning light.

175
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,765
With a smile in his soul,
he descended Mount Crumpit...

176
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,268
...cheerily blowing Who-Who
on his trumpet.

He brought back their floof
to the Who girls and boys.

180

He brought back their snoof
and their tringlers and fuzzels.

181
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,160
He brought back their pantookas,
their dafflers and wuzzels.

182
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,373
He brought everything back,
all the food for the feast.

183

And he himself, The Grinch...

...carved the roast beast.
