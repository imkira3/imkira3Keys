Not that you care, John,

499
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,787
but it's a matter of national
security, all right?

500
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,420
He's got the goods to stop Viktor
Chagarin, and we need that to happen.

501
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,626
Well, great, Jack.

502
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,665
Let's drop him off at the
Embassy, and we can go home.

503
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,335
Are you kidding me? After what
happened at the safe house?

504
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,012
Look, it doesn't work
like that, all right?

505
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,290
It's a huge diplomatic mess,
and I'm a burnable asset.

506
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,138
So, I now need that file
to un-fuck this mission.

507
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,434
Any more questions?

508
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,016
Yeah, just one.

509
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,306
How come you never called
and told me where you were?

510
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,475
Like you'd give a shit.

511
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,790
Shit.

512
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,126
Well, we're not going in the front door.

513
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,258
All right, hold up, hold up.

514
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,354
Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right?
We're almost done.

515
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,019
As soon as we get that key,
we're gonna grab the file,

516
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,228
get you and your daughter
out of Russia, all right?

517
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,692
All right.

518
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,869
Listen to me, you're doing good.
All right?

519
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,347
I need you to hang here a second.
Keep an eye on him, John.

520
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,572
Hey, hey.

521
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,369
What is it with all this "John" shit?
Whatever happened to "Dad?"

522
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,708
Good question.

523
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,592
In Russia, we have
word for men like him.

524
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,879
<i>"Krutoi."</i>

525
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,970
It means "tough,"
"hard."

526
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,477
In America, it means
"juvenile delinquent."

527
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,648
Is he your only child?

528
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,069
No. I got a daughter, too.

529
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,114
You?

530
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,828
I have only my <i>Solnyschka.</i>

531
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,995
When she was little,
I was working all the time.

532
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,912
I believed work was
all that mattered.

533
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,836
I screwed my
kid's life up, too.

534
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,087
You work all the time

535
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,094
around the clock most of the
time, when you're a cop.

536
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:54,934
I just thought that working all the
time was a good thing, you know?

537
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,437
I didn't help him at all.

538
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,446
It's never too late,

539
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,948
I hope.

540
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,790
Okay, let's go.

541
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,939
All right, Yuri, which part of
the building is the ballroom in?

542
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,962
Main tower.

543
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,676
Main tower.
Which floor?

544
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,471
Top floor.

545
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,593
What about security?

546
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,519
You remember any guards?
Cameras? Anything like that?

547
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,555
I don't know.

548
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,224
Well, I need you to remember.

549
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,392
I was in prison for five
years, how should I know?

550
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,360
Everything could have changed.
I know.

551
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,193
Just think, all right?
Picture it in your head.

552
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,991
The ballroom was closed in '89.

553
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,152
I think it's under
construction now.

554
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,908
JACK: So that floor's
unsecured.

555

My daughter is in there.

556

I'm scared to death, let's go!
