2
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,569
Motherfuckers!

3
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,961
Fuck.

4
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,365
Fuck!

5
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,962
We're almost home, buddy!

6
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,247
Whoo!

7
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,881
Whoo!

8
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,767
<i>Hey-</i>

9
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,723
My name's Alan and I bought a giraffe!

10
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,922
He's all mine!

11
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,405
He's super friendly!

12
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,201
Oh, wow.

13
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,850
Look at the giraffe.

14
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,082
Oh, my God. Where do you think it's going?

15
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,966
Whoo!

16
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,522
Oh, my life is great! I have a wonderful life!

17
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,642
I have a wonderful life!

18
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,487
Yes, sir. Absolutely, I will.
Thank you so much. No, of course.

19
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,845
No, no. And again, I'm so sorry.

20
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,682
That was the mayor, Alan.

21
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,925
It was an accident.

22
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,411
You said you'd always love me
no matter what I did.

23
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,360
I know and I do. You're my best friend.
But, Alan, why would you buy a giraffe?

24
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,251
I've always wanted one.

25
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,171
I could feed him from my tree house.

26
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,402
Besides, they remind me a lot of myself.

27
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,001
In what way?

28
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,011
They're majestic, pensive and tall.

29
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,208
- Pensive?
- Yeah.

30
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
- Where'd you learn that word?
-"Words With Friends."

31
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,646
- What friends, Alan?
- You can set it on random.

32
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,967
Alan, aside from the fact
that you shut down a freeway...

33
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,962
...you murdered a wild animal.
It's national news.

34
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,164
You don't want to know the checks
I had to write to fix this.

35
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,163
Oh, please. We're rich.

36
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,687
We are not anything, Alan.

37
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,521
I am well-off. You are my 40-year-old son--

38
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,364
Forty-two. I'm 42!

39
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,002
--42-year-old son who still lives at home.

40
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,642
You are to go back on your medication
or I'm cutting you off.

41
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,644
You're bluffing. When's dinner?

42
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,641
Your mother and I can't take this anymore!

43
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,690
- Well, you might have to.
- I can't do it!

44
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,046
I cannot do this!

45
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,290
I don't care what you say anymore

46
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,961
Alan! Alan!

47
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,602
<i>Ave</i>

48
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,769
<i>Maria</i>

49
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,202
My God, he's got the voice of an angel.

50
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,964
It's breathtaking.

51
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,488
<i>Ave</i>

52
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,683
Maria

53
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,723
I can't believe my daddy is dead.

54
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,929
I can think of so many people
I would rather have died first.

55
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,366
Like my mother.

56
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,291
As many of you know...

57
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,007
...my father and I were extremely close.

58
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,564
He was my life partner.

59
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,162
He would often tell me,
almost on a daily basis...

60
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,970
...that I was his favorite child.

61
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,682
I'll always remember the last words
he said to me:

62
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,323
"I'm proud of you, Alan.

63
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,085
Never change."

64
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,124
Well...

65
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,170
...I heard you loud and clear, Daddy.

66
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,842
I will never change.

67
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,765
Never, ever.

68
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,485
Oh, Mom.

69
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,810
Go ahead, chief.

70
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,847
Sid Garner was a beloved husband...

71
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,605
...father and neighbor.

72
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,368
Wow, rough day.

73
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,285
- Yeah, how's Tracy doing?
- Not great.

74
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,649
Her mother's totally on the edge,
and if all this weren't enough...

75
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,644
...apparently Alan's been off his meds
for almost six months.

76
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,006
Oh, boy.

77
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,208
Yeah, it has not been pretty.

78
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,046
- Then there's the whole fucking giraffe thing.
- I thought that was pretty funny.

79
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,043
- What?
- Come on. He killed a giraffe.

80
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,884
Who gives a fuck?

81
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,004
You know, I wasn't gonna say anything,
but Alan's been stopping by my office lately.

82
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,043
You're kidding me. What for?

83
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,882
I don't know. He just sits in the waiting room
and reads <i>Highlights</i> magazine.

84
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,323
Fills in the puzzles, whatever he can,
and then leaves.

85
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,131
Check it out.

86
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,080
- Wow.
- Jesus, what are you gonna do with him?

87
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,971
Actually,
I wanted to talk to you guys about that.

88
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,691
Linda really wants to stage
an intervention for him.

89
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,683
An intervention? Really?

90
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,649
I think that sounds like a great idea.

91
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,643
Yeah, the thing is...

92
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,522
...she's pretty convinced he won't agree to it
unless all of us are there.

93
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,490
I mean, you know how he is.

94
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,803
I don't know. It seems a little extreme to me.

95
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,810
Oh, God. Look at him now.

96
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,804
Okay, I'm in. When are we doing it?

97
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,684
So we talked to Tracy today...

98
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,327
...and she said that the treatment facility
that they found is really nice.

99
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,484
It's beautiful. I checked it out online.
Great reputation.

100
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,725
Who gives a fuck? It's in Arizona. We gotta go
on like a two-day drive for this shit?

101
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,927
Here we go.

102
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,811
They should just save their money
and send him to fat camp.

103
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,007
- Phil.
- What?

104
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,209
He should lose weight. He'll find a woman.
The dude's lonely.

105
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,244
If he's so lonely,
why don't the you spend more time with him?

106
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,808
- No, trust me, you don't want that.
- No. You definitely don't want that.

107
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,883
Come on. He's not that bad.

108
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,964
I mean, what's the worst that's happened?
The tattoo?

109
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,721
Yeah, the tattoo's the worst.

110
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,086
Right?

111
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,210
Definitely. Tattoo was the worst. Nightmare.

112
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,482
Speaking of which, you ever get tested?

113
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,846
Excuse me?

114
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,365
You know, because of the ink.

115
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,040
That went inside you.

116
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,885
I'm fine.

117
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,607
- Take care.
- All right, good luck tomorrow.

118
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,171
Oh, thanks.

119
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,128
<i>- I'll</i> pick you up at 11.
Perfect.

120
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,406
Thank you so much.

121
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,131
Thanks.

122
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,244
- Again, thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, of course.

123
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,290
This is Nico. Nico is a good friend of Alan's.

124
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,490
- What's up, bros?
- Oh, yeah, hey.

125
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,487
And that's Blanca. Blanca's been with us
since Alan was a baby.

126
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,005
- Hello.
- Hello.

127
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,323
And this is Timothy.
Timothy lives across the street.

128
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,970
He and Alan swim together.

129
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,288
- Hey, what's up, little man?
- Hey.

130
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,568
- Why don't you guys take a seat?
- Yeah.

131
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,767
Tracy's on her way back with Alan right now.

132
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,608
Obviously, he has no idea this is coming,
so things might get a little intense.

133
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,331
But, no matter what happens, remember:

134
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,404
This is all about Alan getting better.

135
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,280
Mother, Oreo smoothie, now!

136
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,605
Oh.

137
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,368
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey.

138
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,410
Hey, Timothy. Little cold for a swim, isn't it?

139
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,529
Oh, wow. Look. You went to the pier today.
How was that?

140
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,728
- We had a great time.
- Yeah.

141
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,930
I played skee ball for, like, 45 minutes.
It was a pretty sick workout.

142
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,844
What's going on?

143
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,766
Uh, ahem, why don't you have a seat, bud?
We just want to talk to you for a sec.

144
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,763
Okay.

145
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,286
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey. Yeah.

146
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

147
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,281
Oh, you got me.

148
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,771
So, Alan...

149
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,084
...we're all here to tell you
about an awesome place...

150
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,844
...called New Horizons.

151
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,963
That does sound awesome.

152
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,931
Alan, this is an intervention.

153
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,447
A what?

154
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,487
Mom.

155
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,810
Alan.

156
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,042
"I love you so much. We all do.

157
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,249
But we can't keep lying to each other.

158
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,283
Ever since you were a baby, all I want--"

159
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,767
Oh, my God, is anybody else falling asleep?

160
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,081
Alan, listen.

161
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,681
- No offense, Morn, but you're boring.
- Mr. Alan.

162
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,087
Oh, now you?

163
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,045
"I pick up after you for 30 years.

164
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,245
I cleaned your room.
I see things no one should ever see.

165
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,091
But I pray for you.

166
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,046
- Mr. Alan, everyone--"
- Hey.

167
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,248
- Someone should clean that up.
- Alan.

168
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,483
Alan. You are not well.

169
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,803
You're off your meds and you're
clearly upsetting your whole family.

170
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,248
- That's baloney.
- Alan, if you say yes to this...

171
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,041
...we drive you there today, and I promise
you will come back a changed man.

172
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,611
Who's we? What do you mean, "we"?
Who's we?

173
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,048
We. All of us. Stu, Phil, me, you.

174
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,649
You going, Phil?

175
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,243
I love you, Alan.

176
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,050
Hey, Alan, you hungry?

177
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,168
You wanna get some Arby's?

178
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,004
No, thanks.

179
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,126
You know, I meant to tell you earlier,
that's a really cool vest you got on.

180
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,048
Thanks, Phil. It was my dad's.

181
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,611
He died in it.

182
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,091
Whoa.

183
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,969
That's intense.

184
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,011
Hey, Alan, just want to say what you're doing
is really brave. We're proud of you.

185
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,924
Yeah, you're gonna do great.

186
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,927
Stop the car.
I don't want to do this anymore.

187
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,048
- What?
- I changed my mind.

188
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,130
Alan, you can't change your mind.
Everybody's counting on you.

189
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,931
I'm fine just the way I am.
I want to go home.

190
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,770
Turn the car around.
Now, please! I don't--

191
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,925
What the fuck was that?

192
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,685
- Oh, my God! He's doing it on purpose!
- Get out of his way!

193
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,325
I am, I am.

194
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,163
- Hey! Hey, get the fuck off!
- You have to exchange information.

195
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,120
- Why?
- Jesus. Phil!

196
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,691
- Phil! Phil!
- Oh, shit!

197
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,927
- Get away from him!
- I'm trying!

198
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,568
- Look out!
- Oh, shit!

199
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,522
AW, shit! Oh, shit.

200
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,327
Shit!

201
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,921
Go, go, go!

202
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,923
Lock your doors! Doug, lock your doors!

203
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,923
Shit! What's going on?

204
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,811
Get the fuck-- Hang on!

205
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,530
- Help!
- Let go, fucking asshole!

206
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,768
- Stu! We're okay.
- We're in an elevator!

207
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,206
Where are you?

208
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,600
What the fuck is going on?

209
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,210
Please, this is a huge mistake.

210
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,890
You got the wrong guys!

211
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,169
I got the right fucking guys! Get him up.
Pick him up. Put him here.

212
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,410
- You're Black Doug! That's Black Doug!
- Shut the fuck up with that. Shut the fuck up.

213
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,250
Oh, my God. It is.

214
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,923
Alan, tell me right now,
why is Black Doug kidnapping us?

215
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,401
- I said don't call me that shit no more.
- Sorry.

216
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,767
- It ain't Alan's fault.
- Thank you, Black Doug.

217
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,089
- Motherfucker!
- Doug!

218
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,441
- Doug!

219
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,806
- Just Doug, okay?
- Yeah.

220
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,086
Why are you doing this?

221
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,651
Because“.

222
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,722
...I told him to.

223
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,041
I'm Marshall.

224
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,524
And whether you know it or not...

225
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,647
...we all have something in common.

226
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,048
And it all started four years ago
when this moron...

227
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,129
...sold the wrong drugs to this dumb fuck.

228
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,127
You have no idea the chain of events
that were set in motion that night...

229
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,966
...in the parking lot of a fucking liquor store.

230
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,727
What up, nigga?

231
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,525
Excuse me?

232
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,126
Chill out, I'm not a cop.
Just in town for the night.

233
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,362
Me and my boys looking to get our freak on.

234
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,688
You sold Alan roofies.

235
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,883
Oh, shit. I must've mixed up the bags.

236
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,371
My fault, Alan.

237
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,564
Damn. Marshall gonna be pissed off at me
on that one.

238
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,730
<i>Damn. Marshall gonna be
pissed off at me on that one.</i>

239
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,445
Marshall?

240
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,489
You're Marshall.

241
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,927
You brought us out here because of that?

242
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,761
You're not here because of that.

243
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,164
You're here because some Chinaman
I never heard of strolls into my town...

244
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,641
...and takes one of my guys off the street.

245
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,484
- Mr. Chow?
- Yes.

246
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,847
Yes, Mr. Leslie fucking Chow.

247
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,048
You introduced a virus into my life.

248
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,045
Oh, God, what did he do?

249
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,486
He fucked me in the ass.

250
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,722
Oh, he does that from time to time.

251
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,803
Not literally.

252
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,207
Jesus!

253
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,841
A few weeks after your bullshit, I get word...

254
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,685
...this sheik is coming in from Abu Dhabi.

255
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,568
<i>He was looking to make some
less-than-legal investments.</i>

256
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,925
<i>He brought his two wives...</i>

257
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,363
<i>...and $42 million in gold bars.</i>

258
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,606
<i>It was a lay-up.</i>

259
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,205
Get down! Get down!

260
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,560
<i>We took it all.</i>

261
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,525
<i>Two vans, each with 21 million in gold.</i>

262
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,883
<i>MY guys split up.</i>

263
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,768
<i>One of them made it back...</i>

264
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,009
<i>...one of them didn't.</i>

265
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,091
ls there a problem, officer?

266
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,884
Not anymore, motherfucker.

267
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,566
Leslie Chow stole $21 million from me...

268
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,131
...on a Tuesday.

269
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,084
Oh, God.

270
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,169
I looked everywhere for him.

271
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,243
But he's gone, no one can find him.

272
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,849
Until the little cockroach got himself pinched
in Bangkok.

273
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,889
So I pay him a visit.

274
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,167
<i>I offer him a truce.</i>

275
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,001
<i>I won't touch a hair on his head.</i>

276
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,642
<i>I just want him to tell me where my gold is.</i>

277
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,524
<i>He refuses to talk.</i>

278
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,529
Not only does he refuse to talk to me...

279
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,605
...he has no communication with anyone
from the outside...

280
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,091
...except you!

281
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,571
<i>Hey-</i>

282
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,131
It's unfair!

283
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,964
Alan, you been talking to Chow?

284
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,691
- They've been writing letters.
- Hey, those are private!

285
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,211
"Dear Leslie, OMG, the McRib is back!
Why was it ever gone?"

286
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,566
Exactly!

287
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,644
"Dear Alan,
I threw urine on prison guard today.

288
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,928
Blamed it on cellmate. Wish you were here."

289
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,684
Yeah, I wish I could've seen that.

290
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,970
Letter after letter of total nonsense...

291
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,168
...except for one common thread:

292
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,765
You guys!

293
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,846
The wolf pack.

294
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,445
Jesus Christ, Alan.

295
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,210
Five weeks ago, Chow escaped
from maximum security detention.

296
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,131
Oh, fuck.

297
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,284
He stowed aboard a shipping freighter
bound for the West Coast.

298
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,687
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

299
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,003
Alan, if you know where he is,
you tell this man right now.

300
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,202
Phil, I don't know, I swear.
I haven't talked to him in months.

301
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,010
We gotta do it the hard way.

302
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,809
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck? Hey!

303
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,201
- Let's go.
- Hey! No! No! What the fuck?

304
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,521
Whoa, what are you doing?

305
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,810
Doug is my insurance. He stays with me.

306
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,566
You don't give me Chow,
I blow his brains out.

307
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,051
You go to the cops...

308
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,681
...I blow his brains out.

309
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,491
That's insane! We don't even know
where the fuck he is!

310
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,483
No one does.

311
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,087
But I figure the wolf pack
has the best chance of finding him.

312
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,321
You have three days.

313
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,491
Get to work.

314
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,048
Can you take Stu instead?

315
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,566
Fuck you, Alan.

316
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,127
Shit.

317
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,891
Shit!

318
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,968
- Alan.
- Yeah, Phil?

319
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,050
- I need you to roll over here
and chew off these hand-ties.

320
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,446
Okay.

321
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,925
- Oh.
- Damn it!

322
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,288
Ow. Oh, fuck!

323
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,722
- Got a little too much steam.
- Get off me.

324
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,002
All right, let me just shimmy down.

325
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,441
- Would you just hold still? Hold still!
- Ow.

326
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,931
Help!

327
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,325
Help!

328
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,482
Holy shit.

329
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,166
What are we gonna do, Stu?

330
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,005
- We're gonna go to the police.
- Oh, no, we're fucking not.

331
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,204
Did you hear that guy?

332
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,845
He will kill Doug, period.

333
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,011
Chow is a cancer.

334
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,521
He's been a cancer
since the first day we met him.

335
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,445
We're gonna hand him over to Marshall
and then it's done.

336
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,806
- Hey, Phil.
- Alan, not now.

337
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,128
But I need you, Stu. I can't do this alone.

338
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,124
Do what alone?
We have no idea where he even is.

339
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,406
- Phil.
- What, Alan?

340
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,131
I was gonna say I got this strange e-mail
the other day.

341
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,762
I wasn't sure what it meant,
but now I think it might be from Chow.

342
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,170
"Fatty, it feels good to be out.

343
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,369
I'm close by. Tell no one. I'll be in touch.

344
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,766
Chow."

345
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,129
This says "Chow."
How did you not know this was from Chow?

346
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,681
At the time, I thought it was "Chow"
like "goodbye."

347
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,524
<i>You know,</i> like, <i>"Chow, arrivederci."</i>

348
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,251
- You know, Sbarro, Papa John's.
- I'm writing him back.

349
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,164
Whoa, wait, wait. Just hold on.

350
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,800
Gonna tell him you're happy he's out
and you'd love to see him.

351
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,167
Ooh, I would love to see him.

352
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,643
Do you even know what's going on?

353
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,646
Yes, I do. Phil's doing all the work,
I'm his assistant...

354
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,566
-...you're standing there looking like an idiot.
- I'm gonna arrange a meeting...

355
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,644
-...and we're gonna take him out.
-"Take him out"?

356
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,968
Who says that?
How do we take someone out?

357
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,324
We'll use drugs.

358
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,209
Prescription drugs.

359
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,840
You know, the kind a dentist has access to.

360
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,322
Good luck finding a dentist
who will write fake prescriptions.

361
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,761
Oh, I know one. His name is Stuart Price.

362
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,729
Now let's go find a fucking pharmacy.

363
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,083
Whoo! You just got schooled, son.

364
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,840
Are you coming or not?

365
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,445
I don't like this plan.

366
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,206
Okay, then. Ciao.

367
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,807
I got a pretty dope sense of humor, bro!

368
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,885
This amount with syringes is just weird.
Go check it out.

369
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,601
Everything okay?

370
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,922
Well, it's just a strange request.

371
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,287
This drug in this amount
and a pack of syringes.

372
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,562
- It's just a little weird.
- Yeah.

373
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,610
It's just kind of an emergency, so...

374
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,481
See, that right there, and you're acting
all fidgety, plus you look like shit...

375
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,881
...in our business, these are all red flags.

376
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,281
I need to call the doctor,
make sure everything's okay.

377
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,525
Aha. You're in luck, because I actually am
the prescribing doctor.

378
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,001
Oh, boy. Another red flag.

379
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,925
It says here you're a dentist.

380
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,209
Yeah. Doctor of Dental Science.

381
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,963
This is fucked up.

382
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,971
Hey, Dad?

383
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,084
I think we got a live one.

384
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,561
How'd we do?

385
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,610
We did good.
I got Demerol, a pack of syringes...

386
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,764
...and almost lost my dental license.

387
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,843
- What about Chow? Anything?
- No.

388
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,731
Oh, look at this.
He e-mailed me like 2O minutes ago.

389
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,123
Alan, we've been sit--

390
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,691
Give me the phone, please.

391
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,882
- What does it say?
- Oh, wow.

392
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,243
He wants to meet Alan tonight at 8.
It says come alone.

393
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,129
- Come alone where?
- A bus stop.

394
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,526
In Tijuana.

395
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,170
Tijuana's the bomb.

396
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,651
Oh, fuck.

397
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,208
No, that's perfect.
No, it's like a three-hour drive from here.

398
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,728
Yeah, Stu, try reading a map.

399
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,284
Yeah, Alan, try reading anything ever.

400
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,125
Yeah, Stu, try not having
such big horse teeth.

401
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,521
All right, we need a plan.

402
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,126
They're meeting on a bus bench
in a public place...

403
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,369
...so Alan needs to convince Chow
to go someplace more private.

404
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,161
Someplace where we can sneak up on him
and drug him.

405
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,727
Like where?

406
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,445
I don't know, like an alley.

407
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,931
What about a movie theater?

408
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,369
Fuck, that's actually a great idea.

409
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,802
The lights go down...

410
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,083
...we take the seats behind him,
we jab him and it's fucking done.

411
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,091
I'll jab him if you want.
I've drugged people before.

412
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,925
Yeah, us.

413
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,607
No offense, but we're not letting you handle
any drugs. You'll kill someone.

414
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,330
Oh, please, I'm an expert.

415
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,289
Remember the marshmallows in Thailand?

416
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,607
Yeah?

417
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,162
I made it so you could eat at least three
before hitting a fatal dose.

418
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,970
Wait.

419
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,841
So you're saying I would've died
if I had had four?

420
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,402
Nobody eats four marshmallows, Stu.

421
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,211
That insane theory is the only reason
I'm still alive?

422
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,886
Yes! And you're welcome, by the way.

423
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,481
Don't say "you're welcome"
for almost killing me.

424
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,687
- Fine.
- Thank you.

425
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,729
- You're welcome.
- Goddamn it!

426
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,211
Oh, God.

427
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,409
You know, you were right.

428
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,409
- About what?
- That place in Arizona. It's not gonna help him.

429
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,571
There is no facility that can fix this guy.

430
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,250
We're gonna spend the rest of our lives
dealing with him...

431
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,722
...because we're all he has now.

432
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,482
You realize that? We're it.

433
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,130
Oh, shit, check it out.

434
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,681
Is that Chow?

435
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,604
Hey, fat stuff.

436
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,966
- Leslie.
- Uh-uh-uh.

437
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,487
- Act cool. Eyes forward.
- Yeah, okay.

438
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,167
- Anyone follow you?
- No, I don't think so.

439
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,651
Good, good.

440
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,327
Gotta keep low profile right now.
Chow wanted man.

441
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,523
Can't trust anyone.

442
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,650
Quick, give me some sugar.
Come on, come on, come on.

443
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,886
What the fuck?

444
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,042
Did he just kiss him?

445
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,283
Listen, I'm in a bit of a pickle, Alan.

446
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,205
- I need a friend.
- Well, I'm your friend, Leslie.

447
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,291
Exactly. That's why I called you down here.

448
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,364
You're the only person I can trust
in this shit-hole of a life.

449
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,881
That's not true.
Stu and Phil are your friends.

450
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,130
Oh, really?

451
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,771
That's interesting.

452
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,731
Where are they?

453
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,649
- Around.
- Around where?

454
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,961
I don't know.

455
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,288
- Motherfucker! I told you to come alone!
- Leslie.

456
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,487
Shit.

457
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,051
- What happened?
- Is he leaving?

458
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,168
We'll talk more! I'll give you another kiss!

459
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,446
He's coming this way.

460
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,364
Get down. Get down.

461
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,921
- Fuck.
- Leslie!

462
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,003
Oh, fuck.

463
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,762
- Get out of the car, you mutts!
- Leslie, no!

464
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,400
- Get off me, fat clown!
- Chow! Chow, calm down!

465
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,648
- Who sent you?
- No one! No.

466
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,043
- We just wanted to see you!
- Liar! No one wants to see Chow!

467
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,329
No, we-- We miss you.

468
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,245
- What?
- We miss you, Chow!

469
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,687
- That's it.
- Yeah.

470
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,365
We miss you.

471
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,646
You miss me?

472
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,890
So much.

473
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,720
You miss Chow.

474
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,407
Yeah, buddy.

475
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,360
We love you, Chow.

476
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,891
<i>I hurt myself today</i>

477
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,123
<i>To see if I still feel</i>

478
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,367
<i>I focus on the pain</i>

479
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,160
<i>The only thing that's real</i>

480
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,929
<i>What have I become</i>

481
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,287
What the fuck am I watching?

482
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,570
<i>My sweetest friend</i>

483
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,761
<i>Everyone I know</i>

484
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,285
<i>Goes away in the end</i>

485
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,091
- Is that gonna be enough?
- Oh, yeah.

486
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,927
This will take about a minute to kick in.
We'll tell the waitress he's drunk.

487
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,401
By the time we get to the car,
he'll be out cold.

488
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,450
<i>My empire of dirt</i>

489
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,525
<i>I will let you down</i>

490
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,282
<i>I will make you hurt</i>

491
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,963
Alan, sit down.

492
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,645
That was really nice, Chow.

493
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,966
Thanks, Phil.

494
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,691
The key is to sing from your heart.

495
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,161
So Mexico, huh?
What are you doing down here?

496
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,291
You know, fucking, doing blow.
Same old, same old.

497
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,885
Ooh, I got into cockfighting.

498
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,691
- Oh, cockfighting. That sounds wonderful.
- Yes.

499
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,008
Basically, been killing it down here.

500
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,927
That is just terrific. Right?

501
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,970
I mean, that's terrific.
I think that calls for a toast.

502
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,400
I like that.

503
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,369
- To killing it.
- Killing it.

504
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,648
Yeah, to killing it.

505
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,726
Mm.

506
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,691
You okay, Chow?

507
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,003
I don't know. You tell me.

508
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,286
So how many rooster birds do you have,
Chow?

509
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,369
- Aah!
- Huh?

510
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,171
- Shh. Act cool or I open his vein.
- Oh, my God.

511
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,164
Why you wanna drug poor Chow?

512
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,523
No, no. It's not what you think.
There's this guy Marshall.

513
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,808
Marshall? How you know that fat fuck?

514
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,851
He says you took his gold. He's got Doug.
He'll kill him unless we bring you back.

515
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,288
It's true! I swear to God, it's true!

516
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,121
Chow. Chow, that's the truth.

517
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,885
Goddamn it!

518
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,170
That motherfucker.

519
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,129
Stu, you okay?

520
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,770
- You all right?
- No.

521
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,765
We're sorry, Chow.

522
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,729
We're sorry.

523
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,850
- We didn't know what else to do.
- Next time, don't lie to Chow.

524
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,447
You're right. You are so right,
and we made a huge mistake.

525
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,610
So, what do we do now?

526
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,086
That depends.

527
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,050
Can I trust you?

528
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,402
What is this place, Chow?

529
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,085
My house.

530
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,161
Chow used to be on top of the world.

531
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,927
Had three beautiful homes
in three different countries.

532
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,291
But this one, my Mexican villa...

533
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,769
...this was my favorite.

534
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,324
And everything got fucked.

535
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,249
Chow go to prison, all my property seized.

536
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,084
My homes...

537
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,481
...sold at auction to highest bidders.

538
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,284
But I know something no one else knows.

539
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,086
This house is where I stashed the gold.

540
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,928
- Marshall's gold?
- Yep.

541
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,203
Hid it inside the basement wall.

542
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,928
No one knows it's there.

543
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,090
We're gonna go get it.

544
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,291
Wait. You mean break in?

545
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,166
Look, Marshall wants his gold.

546
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,051
And he's gonna hunt me down
until he gets it.

547
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,089
If we show up without it, he'll kill me.

548
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,208
We're not breaking in anywhere.

549
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,489
Not anywhere, Stu. My house.

550
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,523
It's piece of cake.

551
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,523
I know every square inch of this place.

552
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,727
The best part, the guy we're stealing it from
doesn't even know it's there.

553
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,128
So he'll never know it's gone.

554
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,529
You guys know what's going on, right?

555
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,361
What do you mean?

556
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,127
Well, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
we're not breaking into this house.

557
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,650
This house is too small.

558
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,724
We're breaking into another house.
This is just a model, right?

559
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,524
What? Alan, no!

560
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,731
My chickens!

561
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,560
Oh, shit!

562
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,807
Chow, what the fuck?

563
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,601
Watch out for the claws! They're trained to kill!

564
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,967
His beak is so sharp!

565
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,167
Ow! Ow!

566
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,126
- Oh, fuck!
- Stay still, I'm trying to help.

567
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,964
- Don't!
- Get it off!

568
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,410
- Fucking bull's-eye!
- Are you out of your mind?

569
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,847
Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!

570
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,965
Stu, the window!

571
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,046
- Get it out!
- Okay, okay!

572
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,565
Get it out!

573
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,050
Shh, shh, shh.

574
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,761
Don't struggle. Let go.

575
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,806
You won a lot of fights, Wallace.

576
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,006
Not this time.

577
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,485
- What the fuck is wrong with those chickens?
- They're angry.

578
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,529
All I feed them is cocaine.

579
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,050
And chicken.

580
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,285
That's some house, Chow.

581
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,240
It was my Shangri-La. Now it's gone.

582
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,523
Could you not spit inside my minivan,
please? Jesus.

583
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,241
Who lives there now?

584
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,051
Some dot-com millionaire. He's never here.

585
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,770
This is a vacation home.

586
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,729
The help doesn't show up on Sundays.

587
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,407
No one there but the guard dogs. Stu?

588
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,360
We'll toss these burgers over the gate,
wait for the Demerol to kick in.

589
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,921
Make sure you put in enough to kill them.

590
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,162
We're not gonna kill the dogs, Chow.

591
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,970
This will knock them out for hours.

592
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,447
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you worked for PETA.

593
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,682
- What a pussy.
- Ha-ha-ha.

594
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,810
Alan, take that.

595
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,161
Aah!

596
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,804
- Where are you going?
- You'll see.

597
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,525
Pardon me, little loser.

598
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,163
Excuse me, fucking asshole.

599
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,766
Follow me.

600
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,089
<i>Okay, here's the deal:
two security panels inside.</i>

601
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,925
<i>If you cut only one wire, it triggers alarm.</i>

602
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,128
<i>Place will be crawling with cops.</i>

603
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,727
But if you cut wire on both panels
at same time, alarm disabled.

604
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,963
Yeah, but how are we gonna get inside
without tripping the alarm?

605
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,849
Check this out.

606
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,442
- Any more stupid questions?
- Whoa.

607
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,170
Now, who's coming with me?

608
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,686
I'll do it.

609
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,287
You wanna tell him?

610
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,607
Oh, um...

611
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,843
Alan, you're just too fat.

612
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,851
Roger that.

613
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,205
OW. Ahh.

614
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,249
You kicked me, you motherfucker.

615
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,411
No, no, no. Don't get up.
Will trip motion detectors.

616
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,721
Stay low like dog.

617
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,848
Okay. Good idea.

618
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,880
- Which way?
- In there. The kitchen.

619
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,890
Aah! What the fuck is that?

620
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,362
Ha, ha.
I'm saying hello. We're dogs, remember?

621
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,401
Hey, Stu?

622
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,971
Check it out.

623
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,040
Oh, my God! So gross!

624
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,006
God! Chow, cut it out!

625
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,368
Okay, I'm here.

626
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,965
Now what?

627
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,447
Pull the cover off so you can see the wires.

628
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,601
Okay.

629
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,286
Okay. Done!

630
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,284
Okay, on three, cut the gray wire.

631
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,442
One, two...

632
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,761
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

633
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,491
I don't have a gray wire.
I have red, green and yellow.

634
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,526
That's weird. I have light gray,
medium gray, dark gray.

635
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,361
You do?

636
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,040
Motherfucker.

637
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,687
My bad. I'm colorblind.

638
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,887
You're what?

639
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,168
Fuck it, just cut the middle one.

640
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,644
No, my middle one could be different.
The wires are all twisted.

641
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,724
- On three. One, two--
- Chow, stop!

642
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,606
God.

643
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,208
Hold on, I'm coming to you.

644
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,164
What the fuck's taking them so long?

645
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,971
Where'd you get that shirt, the Diesel store?

646
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,240
Phil.

647
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,890
What?

648
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,046
It's a cute top. Where did you get that shirt?

649
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,440
What's the problem?

650
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,331
Just point to the wire you want me to cut.

651
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,727
- This gray one right here.
- Great.

652
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,848
For your information, that's green.

653
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,685
Ooh, tsk, tsk, tsk.

654
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,887
Which one's red?

655
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,168
The one in your left hand.

656
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,161
- Wait, which hand is that? I'm also dyslexic.
- What the fuck?

657
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,409
- Where'd you get it?
- I don't know. I'll find out, I'll get you one.

658
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,849
There's a cool Diesel store in the mall
that I like to go to. Right next to the food court.

659
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,008
I don't know if it's Diesel.

660
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,329
Looks like a Diesel.

661
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,080
What's the matter with you?

662
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,925
Okay, you're still holding
the one I left you with, right?

663
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,366
Pretty much. Heh, heh.

664
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,124
Oh, fuck.

665
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,203
All right. On three!

666
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,521
One...

667
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,361
...two...

668
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,441
...three.

669
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,528
Holy shit, it worked.

670
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,801
All good?

671
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,404
- Easy peasy.
- All right.

672
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,721
You have no idea.

673
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,041
Come on.

674
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,004
Whoops.

675
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,688
- Jesus, be careful, Chow.
- Ha, ha.

676
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,564
Fuck this guy.

677
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,809
Living in my house. Living my life.

678
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,644
Can we just stick to the plan?

679
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,847
Fine.

680
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,088
Ha, ha. Ruined.

681
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,489
He is completely out of control.

682
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,563
Let's just get this done.

683
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,651
This way. Come on, come on.

684
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,129
It's buried behind this wall.

685
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,166
- Alan.
- Here you go, boss.

686
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,606
Aah!

687
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,327
Fuck!

688
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,608
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

689
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,450
Just warming up.

690
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,450
It's so heavy. Do we have a lighter one?

691
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,611
- Why don't you just let me do it, Chow?
- Okay. Either way, you or me. Same thing.

692
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,721
You might wanna take your shirt off.
Makes it easier.

693
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,884
- What?
- I've heard that too.

694
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,285
See that? Chow come back for you.

695
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,361
That's the last of it.

696
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,530
You sure?

697
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,007
- Yeah.
- You triple sure?

698
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,726
- Yes!
- Good! Heh-heh-heh.

699
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,440
Chow?

700
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,960
Chow?

701
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,767
Chow!

702
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,605
Chow!

703
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,090
Chow!

704
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,210
Chow, open this fucking door right now!

705
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,850
Chow!

706
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,604
Stuart Price.

707
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,520
No felonies. One arrest:

708
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,767
Las Vegas, Nevada.

709
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,201
Phil Wenneck.

710
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,283
No felonies. One arrest:

711
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,927
Also Las Vegas, Nevada.

712
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,369
Alan Garner.

713
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,005
Is this record accurate?

714
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,970
Uh-huh.

715
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,729
I did that. Mm-hm.

716
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,365
Yeah.

717
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,688
Masturbating on a city bus.
Yep, that was me.

718
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,769
Look, we've been here for 5 hours.

719
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,843
We already told your guys everything.

720
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,047
No.

721
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,806
You told them a story
about a little Chinese man.

722
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,566
Leslie Chow. He's an international criminal.
Look it up.

723
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,610
A little Chinese man that no one in town
has seen or heard of.

724
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,206
The hotel where you say he's staying?
No one there.

725
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,448
Probably because he left town.

726
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,525
That's one theory.

727
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,444
Another theory is that you're lying.

728
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,842
"Lewd behavior, Cracker Barrel,
Christmas Eve."

729
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,286
Excuse me.

730
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,209
We're fucking dead.

731
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,890
Why would Mr. Chow do this?

732
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,883
Because he's a greedy piece of shit
who used us.

733
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,002
- Yeah, but he's our friend.
- Oh.

734
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,685
Grow up, Alan.

735
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,481
You're free to leave.

736
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,881
All the charges have been dropped.

737
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,721
By who?

738
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,370
It's your lucky day.

739
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,568
There's a car waiting for you out front.

740
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,482
Come on, let's go.

741
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,244
Oh, Jesus.

742
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,081
What?

743
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,885
I'm sorry.

744
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,287
What is this?

745
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,691
Get in the car.

746
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,405
Excuse me, sir?

747
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,847
Where we headed?

748
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,730
Welcome back.

749
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,970
- What the fuck?
- Let's go, guys.

750
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,884
Out to the back.

751
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,322
- Doug?
- Guys. Careful.

752
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,130
Get your ass back over here.

753
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,203
Leslie Chow never lived here.

754
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,526
You didn't break into his old house.

755
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,684
You broke into my house.

756
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,047
I don't understand.

757
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,047
You didn't get back the gold
he stole from me.

758
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,921
You got the other half that he didn't.

759
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,844
Oh, my God!

760
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,401
What, you mean the half he never had?

761
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,530
He's a world-class rat,
and you three were his accomplices.

762
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,727
- No!
- We had no idea.

763
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,531
We were trying to help you.
We thought you'd be happy!

764
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,603
Thank you so much.

765
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,331
Thank you for ripping me off.

766
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,369
Thank you for desecrating my home!

767
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,364
And thank you for killing my fucking dogs!

768
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,921
We didn't kill your dogs.
They're just tranquilized.

769
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,050
Oh, right.

770
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,801
You don't know.

771
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,930
- Chow snapped their necks on his way out.
- What?

772
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,811
And somebody's gotta pay.

773
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,321
- He's right.
- No, no, no! Aah!

774
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,762
My head of security.

775
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,084
Couldn't stop three fuckups and a Chinaman
with a pair of wire cutters.

776
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,687
Unreal.

777
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,764
Aw. Man.

778
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,528
That's okay. I know it's scary.

779
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,202
Hector. Run upstairs and grab a pair
of sweatpants for Alan here.

780
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,171
I'm a 44 slim.

781
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,922
Can you bring me a few options?

782
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,924
You found Chow once. Find him again.

783
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,366
And my gold.

784
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,521
Wait.

785
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,889
We don't even have a car.
Chow stole my minivan.

786
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,691
Take the limo. Hector has the keys.

787
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,604
And get going.

788
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,328
I'm killing Dougs today.

789
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,561
- I never saw anyone get killed before.
- Right?

790
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,802
My God, that was so intense.

791
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,804
I mean, he just fell and then he's dead.

792
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,121
I feel sick.

793
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,611
Me too.

794
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,451
Well, maybe we should get some food, guys.

795
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,531
What are we gonna do?
We have no idea where Chow is.

796
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,364
I don't know.

797
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,887
He took your minivan.
We could report it stolen...

798
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,883
...and then they could track him down?

799
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,005
It's worth a shot.

800
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,650
Oh, fuck!

801
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,370
I left my phone in the minivan.

802
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,009
Well, if you lost your phone, Phil,
I have that <i>Find My Phone</i> app.

803
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,162
We have bigger problems than that, Alan.

804
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,800
No, wait, wait, wait.
If your phone's in the minivan...

805
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,651
...and Chow has the minivan,
then your phone's with Chow!

806
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,571
You heard him.
We have bigger problems than that, Stu.

807
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,728
Alan, give me your phone. Quick.

808
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,809
- That's brilliant.
- Yes.

809
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,003
- Wait, what's your password?
-"Hey Phil."

810
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,400
- Yeah?
- No, that's it.

811
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,840
- What?
- That's my password.

812
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,161
"Hey Phil."

813
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,920
It is it.

814
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,646
Phil gets it.

815
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,485
Nothing worse than losing your phone.

816
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,369
You just saw a man get murdered.
Your brother-in-law is kidnapped.

817
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,010
You sure there's nothing worse?

818
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,964
You don't get it, Stu.

819
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,846
You just don't get it, do you?

820
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,771
I have over 60 apps on that phone.

821
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,689
What if I lost my phone?

822
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,407
Do you have any idea how much time
and man-hours it would take...

823
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,289
...to re-download those apps?

824
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,524
You are right.
I had not thought of that. Thank you.

825
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,882
Oh, God, it's not always about you, Stu!

826
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,929
It's locating.

827
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,887
- Oh, God, of course.
- What?

828
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,686
Where is he?

829
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,410
He's in fucking Vegas.

830
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,006
- Shotgun.
- Oh.

831
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,528
Oh, no.

832
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,724
Hey, Stu?

833
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,724
I don't enjoy talking to you that way.

834
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,322
I don't know why you insist
on making me blow my top.

835
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,160
We've been on a lot of adventures together...

836
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,721
...but it seems like you haven't
learned anything.

837
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,245
Anything!

838
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,681
You think on it.

839
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,444
I'll be in the limo.

840
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,050
He's okay.

841
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,045
Someone needs to burn this place
to the ground.

842
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,964
I told myself I would never come back.

843
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,804
Well, don't worry.

844
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,008
It all ends tonight.

845
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,644
It says 200 yards up on the right.

846
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,242
And there it is.

847
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,811
Amazing.

848
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,843
Looks like he ditched it.

849
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,529
-It's open.
- No shit.

850
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,330
Well, look around.

851
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,687
Let's see if he left anything in here.

852
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,130
- I found the Demerol.
- Good. Keep it, we're gonna need it.

853
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,682
I got my phone. No fucking keys, though.

854
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,003
- Alan, anything?
- No, not even the gold.

855
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,481
- Why the fuck would Chow come down here?
- I know, right?

856
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,201
Why here?

857
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,925
<i>You can't match the pure strength
and power...</i>

858
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,650
<i>...of John Cena!</i>

859
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,202
- Cena <i>puts Punk down!</i>
- Oh! Ha, ha.

860
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,771
Nice!

861
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,921
Excuse me.
Have you happened to see the driver...

862
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,651
...of that minivan that's out front?
Short Asian guy?

863
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,086
Yeah, they're all short.

864
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,891
Ha, ha. That's so true.

865
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,965
Right, but he may have been trying
to pawn some gold.

866
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,203
That would be my business, wouldn't it?

867
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,404
I like your T-shirt.

868
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,967
I saw that show at the Forum.

869
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,523
He played "Captain Jack."

870
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,283
Yeah, I heard that was legendary.

871
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,930
Woman...

872
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,764
...you have no idea.

873
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,410
Try me.

874
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,401
Cassie, I'm hungry.
I thought you ordered Chinese.

875
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,450
Mom, I'm with a customer!

876
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,410
- You'll eat when I say it's time to eat!
- But the doctor--

877
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,450
If you don't reverse that right now,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

878
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,446
She's rude.

879
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,931
Thank you.

880
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,282
Yeah, you hear that, Ma? Nobody likes you!

881
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,726
Yeah, keep your mouth shut!

882
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,450
Whoa.

883
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,885
You're smart.

884
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,641
A Chinese guy came in here earlier.

885
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,450
It was pretty weird.

886
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,449
He pawned a gold brick.

887
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,120
The thing's worth 400 grand,
he took 18,000.

888
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,490
- Did he say where he was going?
- I'm sorry, was I talking to you?

889
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,970
He said he wanted three things:

890
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,164
He wanted some girls,
some guys and some bath salts.

891
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,086
I gave him a card for an escort service
and he took off.

892
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,765
Pretty high-end,
so good luck getting anything out of them.

893
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,844
Thank you.

894
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,045
We gotta go. We should go.

895
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,884
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

896
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,242
I'll get it, I'll get it. I'll get it.

897
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,761
Anything?

898
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,445
No, I'm still on hold.

899
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,447
Oh, look how happy this fucking guy is.

900
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,286
Have you ever witnessed a moment
with that much heat?

901
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,522
I mean, white-hot heat, bro!

902
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,486
No, it was pretty intense.

903
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,766
Yeah!

904
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,290
Yeah, it's actually an emergency.

905
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,920
He has a thick Asian accent.

906
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,450
I totally get it...

907
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,450
...but this is a highly unusual circumstance
and--

908
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,649
Okay. All right.

909
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,647
It's an escort service.

910
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,609
They're not gonna tell us shit.

911
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,484
Maybe an escort would.

912
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,449
- You still have her number?
- Yeah, but...

913
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,284
...it'd be pretty awkward.

914
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,884
It's all we got.

915
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,402
She smiled at me again,
from inside the shop.

916
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,243
Ha, ha. This is the best day of my life.

917
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,366
Hey!

918
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,363
Oh, my God, you guys-

919
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,807
It's been so long.

920
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,684
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.

921
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,605
- You look great.
- So do you! You're pregnant.

922
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,041
I feel so fat.

923
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,247
Oh, please.

924
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,046
Do you guys mind taking your shoes off?
I'm a germ freak.

925
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,565
- Yeah, sure.
- Of course.

926
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,201
Alan.

927
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,362
Alan, what are you doing?

928
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,481
Sorry.

929
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,561
- Wow, you have a great house.
- Thank you.

930
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,041
I got married a year ago to a surgeon.

931
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,726
- Another doctor, can you believe it?
- Another doctor.

932
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,928
His name's Jeff. You guys would love him.

933
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,329
Tyler, say hi to Mommy's friends.

934
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,847
Hi.

935
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,161
Hey!

936
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,042
Wait, is that the baby?

937
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,531
Yeah, time flies, huh?

938
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,841
Wow.

939
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,322
Jade is there a place we could talk
that's a little bit more private?

940
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,602
Let's go in the kitchen.
You guys want coffee?

941
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,886
Perfect.

942
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,044
Hey', you coming?

943
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,521
Is it okay if I go say hello to the little guy?

944
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,284
Of course.

945
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,367
Nice stuff.

946
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,321
Thanks. Jeff bought it for me.

947
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,521
Jeff. Who's that, your fake dad?

948
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,851
Your name was Carlos once.

949
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,570
Did you know that?

950
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,881
No.

951
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,530
Well, it was.

952
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,166
And, frankly, it suits you better.

953
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,446
Okay.

954
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,129
Do you remember me?

955
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,565
No.

956
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,600
Are you my real dad?

957
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,886
Yes.

958
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,965
I don't know. You gotta understand,
I've been out of that world a few years now.

959
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,521
Yeah, of course. We totally get that.

960
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,524
I mean, Jeff knows everything
and he's cool, but--

961
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,762
We're just asking if you can call around...

962
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,287
...just find out if anybody
might know where he is.

963
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,166
We could really use your help.

964
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,124
You used to love it
when I would carry you around.

965
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,170
Sometimes I can still feel your little head
on my chest.

966
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,448
So do you like this new Jeff guy?

967
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,524
Yeah, he's nice.

968
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,610
My dad was nice too.
We did everything together.

969
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,728
He was my life partner, heh.

970
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,969
I really let him down.

971
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,122
Okay. Wow.

972
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,206
Just trust me, you don't want to go
over there, okay? Not this one.

973
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,850
I love you too.

974
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,808
She says there's this crazy Chinese guy...

975
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,844
...and he's holed up in the penthouse suite
of Caesars Palace.

976
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,691
There's girls going in and out,
drugs everywhere...

977
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,008
It sounds like a bad scene.

978
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,889
Hey, Alan?

979
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,845
We gotta go.

980
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,525
I gotta go, little man.

981
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,484
It was great talking to you.

982
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,051
High five.

983
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,368
- It's great to see you.
- You too, Jade.

984
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,488
- Thanks so much for your help.
- Yeah.

985
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,165
That's a great kid you got there.

986
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,771
He is the best.

987
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,251
Alan.

988
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,442
Oh, hold on. I have something for you.

989
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,481
Perfect.

990
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,846
Oh, please.

991
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,321
I'll see you around, Carlos.

992
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,363
<i>- Yeah.
- We got him.</i>

993
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,330
- Great. Where is he?
- Caesars Palace.

994
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,881
Change of plans.
Tell him we're going to Vegas.

995
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,930
I'm on my way.

996
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,770
There's a spot just outside of town.

997
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,764
<i>I'll text you the details.
Be there at 6 a.m.</i>

998
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,042
And make sure the little fucker's tied up.

999
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,440
We don't have him.

1000
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,329
Hey, Marshall, it's Phil.

1001
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,641
Maybe Stu wasn't clear.

1002
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,844
We don't actually have Chow,
we just know where he is.

1003
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,367
Yeah, and we were hoping
that you and your guys...

1004
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,445
- ...could go to Caesars and get him.
- I don't give a fuck what you were hoping.

1005
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,449
<i>The deal is you bring Chow to me.</i>

1006
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,008
- Oh, fuck.
- 6 a.m. Or your friend is dead.

1007
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,961
Shit.

1008
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,249
Oh, God.

1009
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,090
This place gives me the chills.

1010
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,169
I know, right?

1011
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,648
It's great to be back.

1012
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,280
- So many good memories.
- Are you kidding me?

1013
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,210
Okay, so here's the deal:

1014
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,442
You need a key just to get onto his floor.

1015
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,729
And then once you're there,
he's got security posted at the door.

1016
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,370
It's ridiculous.

1017
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,488
Let me guess, that's him?

1018
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,411
Yep. The one with the strobe lights.

1019
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,249
Igotanidea.

1020
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,523
But you're not gonna like it.

1021
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,725
It's not gonna work.

1022
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,689
Not with that fucking attitude.

1023
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,851
You know this whole place
is made out of marbles?

1024
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,042
Come on. Go, go, go.

1025
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,087
<i>After we stick Chow, Alan and I are
gonna take him down through the lobby.</i>

1026
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,767
Be waiting in valet.
Engine running, ready to go.

1027
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,570
Are you sure about this?

1028
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,966
Give me the Demerol.

1029
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,726
See you in 20 minutes.

1030
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,961
- Hey, Phil?
- Yeah?

1031
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,167
Don't die.

1032
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,686
All right.

1033
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,966
Are you ready to do this?

1034
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,610
Yeah.

1035
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,530
Wait, what are we doing?

1036
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,969
Holy shit.

1037
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,720
We're gonna climb down...

1038
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,729
...and then it's about an 8-foot drop
to the balcony.

1039
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,489
- All right?
- Yeah.

1040
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,805
No, you spit in your own hand.

1041
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,600
Oh, yeah.

1042
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,929
Dry desert air.

1043
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,046
- Alan, it's fine. You don't need it.
- Okay.

1044
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,725
Oh, God.

1045
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,488
- Unh!
- Careful!

1046
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,491
- Phil!
- I'm all right.

1047
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,891
I'm okay!

1048
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,284
- Hey, Phil.
- What's wrong?

1049
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,606
Hold on a second.

1050
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,046
- What?
- Hold on!

1051
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,441
Like, kick yourself out a little bit.

1052
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,681
Alan.

1053
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,171
- Stay still!
- Alan!

1054
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,641
Did you get it?

1055
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,802
No. Hold on.

1056
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,568
Ha, that's cool, ha-ha-ha.

1057
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,931
Oh! Fuck me!

1058
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,530
Everything all right?

1059
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,050
It's okay!

1060
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,440
It's all right!

1061
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,001
I got it! Whoa.

1062
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,927
Are you okay?

1063
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,364
Alan, it's your turn.

1064
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,565
That's it.

1065
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,285
Phil, I can't. I can't.

1066
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,487
Come on.

1067
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,130
Whoa!

1068
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,566
Alan, you all right?

1069
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,000
Phil, call Security!

1070
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,124
- I think it's slipping!
- Just hold on!

1071
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,766
Oh! God!

1072
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,922
- You need to calm down.
- I'm slipping, Phil!

1073
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,605
Oh! Fuck!

1074
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,002
Oh, shit! You okay?

1075
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,522
Help!

1076
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,645
Oh, no.

1077
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,284
I'm gonna die, Phil.

1078
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,011
No, you're fine. Just...

1079
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,964
Drop down to me.

1080
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,767
No chance.

1081
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,010
I'm good up here.

1082
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,891
Alan, you can do this. I'll catch you.

1083
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,286
Just...

1084
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,841
...let go.

1085
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,960
That's it. That's it. Just drop straight down.

1086
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,641
But don't push off.

1087
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,766
No!

1088
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,564
- Oh, God!
- Come here!

1089
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,644
Holy fuck!

1090
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,171
You Okay?

1091
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,321
Yeah.

1092
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,687
Shit. Oh, fuck.

1093
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,010
I almost died, Phil.

1094
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:49,321
Come on. I wasn't gonna let you go.
You're my boy.

1095
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,843
And you're my man.

1096
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,162
Alan, what are you doing? Alan.

1097
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,691
Okay.

1098
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,528
Let's go get this fucker.

1099
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,407
Hey!

1100
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,087
Have you seen my--?

1101
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,366
Huh?

1102
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,165
Phil!

1103
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,685
Motherfuckers!

1104
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,767
Grab the gun!

1105
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,089
- Oh, fuck!
-  Phil!

1106
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,241
Oh.

1107
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,925
Phil, you okay?

1108
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,481
Chow!

1109
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,007
Chow!

1110
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,364
Chow, open the fucking door!

1111
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,240
Fuck.

1112
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,761
Chow, stop.

1113
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,967
You motherfuckers!

1114
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,329
Leslie, get down from there! Please!
You're gonna hurt yourself!

1115
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,925
Nothing hurts Chow.

1116
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,963
I am invisible!

1117
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:46,446
It's "invincible," and you're not.
You're just out of your fucking mind.

1118
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,762
Now get down from there before you die!

1119
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,371
Die?

1120
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,003
How do you kill what's already dead?
Heh-heh-heh.

1121
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,847
Oh, fuck!

1122
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,963
Holy...

1123
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,605
Woo-hoo!

1124
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,290
- Hey. You okay?
- No.

1125
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,641
<i>Look up.</i>

1126
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,328
What the fuck is that?

1127
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,130
- That's Chow!
- What?

1128
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,731
Follow him.

1129
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,165
Woo-hoo!

1130
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,961
Whoo!

1131
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,888
I love cocaine!

1132
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,005
Out of the way!

1133
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,566
How did this happen?

1134
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,643
<i>We had him trapped,
and then he jumped!</i>

1135
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,365
He's out of his fucking mind!

1136
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,007
I'm out of my fucking mind!

1137
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,611
Wow.

1138
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,606
So beautiful.

1139
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,286
<i>Stu, do not lose him.</i>

1140
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,686
I'm trying.

1141
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,605
Whoa!

1142
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,848
Oh, shit.

1143
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,721
<i>I believe I can fly</i>

1144
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:10,249
<i>I believe I can touch the sky</i>

1145
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:14,924
<i>Think about it every night and day</i>

1146
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,886
We gotta pack up all this gold.
We're taking it with us.

1147
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,530
Talk to me, Stu.

1148
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,131
I got him.

1149
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,441
Ha, ha. I got him!

1150
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,161
Oh, shit!

1151
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,964
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1152
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,885
Shit.

1153
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,968
Fuck! I lost him!

1154
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,202
Don't tell me that. You can't lose him!

1155
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,880
This is so much harder than you realize, Phil.

1156
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,610
I'm just a dentist!

1157
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,449
No, Stu, you're a fucking doctor.
Now go get him.

1158
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,561
Where the fuck did he go?

1159
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,608
Fuck me!

1160
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,768
I should have thought this through!

1161
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,161
Shit!

1162
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,646
Move!

1163
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,050
- Aah!
- Stu?

1164
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,362
- Chow?
- Stop the fucking car!

1165
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,530
- Stu.
- I can't! The pedal is stuck!

1166
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,920
- What?
- Stu?

1167
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,403
- I can't see!
- Stop, motherfucker!

1168
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,689
- Get off!
- Pull over!

1169
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,604
- It won't stop!
- Aah!

1170
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,444
Get off the car!

1171
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,284
I can't see anything!

1172
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,885
Ha-ha-ha. We're gonna die finally.

1173
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,129
Holy shit.

1174
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,130
<i>Stu? Stu, what happened?</i>

1175
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,448
<i>Stu, what's going on?</i>

1176
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,361
We had an accident, and I think he's dead.

1177
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,931
<i>Wait, what?</i>

1178
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,128
I think I killed him.

1179
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,165
Holy shit.

1180
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,165
He's not moving.

1181
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,890
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1182
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,325
Mr. Chow?

1183
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,211
Chow.

1184
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,887
Stuart?

1185
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,689
He's alive. He's okay.

1186
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,001
Oh, great.

1187
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:32,050
Put him in the limo and come get us.
We'll meet you at valet.

1188
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,531
Yeah, okay.

1189
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,846
Stu.

1190
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,524
That was some ride, huh, pal?

1191
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,525
Yeah, it was pretty wild.

1192
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,683
I can't feel my nuts.

1193
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,171
Would you rub them
and make sure they okay?

1194
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,803
It's over, Leslie.

1195
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,361
Wait.

1196
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,523
Let's make a deal.

1197
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,248
Want Chow to blow your dick?

1198
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,371
Come on, Stu.

1199
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,880
I could be a good wife to you.

1200
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,882
- No more deals.
- No, wait!

1201
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,042
Let's put the bags in the back seat.

1202
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,685
Trunk's full.

1203
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,328
Hey, guys? I'm feeling better now.

1204
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,922
All right, it's the next exit,
then four miles straight into the desert.

1205
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,610
Tell you what:

1206
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,560
Let me out, we split the gold four ways.
Everyone wins.

1207
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,242
Marshall gonna kill me!

1208
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,363
My blood will be on your hands!

1209
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:12,602
You want Chow's ghost haunting you
for rest of your life, Stu?

1210
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,161
Floating over you while you make fuck
on your wife?

1211
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,164
He's not gonna kill you, Chow!
He just wants his gold back!

1212
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:22,450
It's gone. I blew the first 2O million in Bangkok.

1213
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,286
- That's why I had to get the other half.
- Enough, Chow! It's over!

1214
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,010
You motherfucker!

1215
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,289
When I get out of this,
I'm gonna rip out your fucking lungs!

1216
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,410
You hear me? You're dead! You're all dead!

1217
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,769
I didn't mean that.

1218
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,367
Chow loses temper sometimes.

1219
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:44,291
Please. I need help.

1220
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,720
I know that now.

1221
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,761
That's the exit.

1222
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,170
They're here.

1223
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,126
Alan, they're coming, grab the last bag.

1224
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,930
Please, Alan.

1225
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,121
Doug!

1226
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,089
Step away from the bags. Let's go!

1227
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,327
We good?

1228
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,562
- It's all there. I promise.
 - Not exactly.

1229
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,047
I'm still missing the original half.

1230
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:03,922
But, no, that's all we have.
Chow said he blew the other half in Bangkok.

1231
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,725
Where is he?

1232
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,570
He's in the trunk.

1233
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,726
Deal's a deal.

1234
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,807
- Doug.
- Give me the keys.

1235
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,765
What are you gonna do with Chow?

1236
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,242
I just wanna talk to him.

1237
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,206
Move.

1238
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,365
You all right?

1239
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,684
What the fuck?

1240
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,722
End of conversation.

1241
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,848
Why would you do that?

1242
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,084
Leslie Chow is madness.

1243
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,129
You don't talk to madness.

1244
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:52,205
If you're lucky, you trap it in the trunk
of your limo and you kill it.

1245
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,007
You did a great thing tonight.

1246
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,487
You should feel good about this.

1247
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,044
What the fuck?
You think this is a fucking game?

1248
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,007
Don't, don't, don't!

1249
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,446
Oh, shit!

1250
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,243
Toodle-loo, motherfuckers.

1251
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,086
Chow.

1252
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,648
Chow. Chow, wait.

1253
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,041
Oh, now you wanna talk, blue eyes?

1254
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,242
No more silent treatment?

1255
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,329
Leslie. No.

1256
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,250
Stay out of this, fatty.

1257
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,970
No, Leslie.

1258
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,481
You shoot Phil, you gotta go through me.

1259
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,006
What?

1260
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,482
- Alan.
- Quiet.

1261
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,603
I'm in a stare-off.

1262
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,730
Today you all live.

1263
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,087
Because one of you was a friend.

1264
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,843
Alan, what did you do?

1265
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,723
I unlocked the latch
between the back seat and the trunk.

1266
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,443
And left him his gun?

1267
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,568
Yeah, I didn't think it all the way through.

1268
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,042
He gave Chow a fighting chance.

1269
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,529
That's all I ever need.

1270
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,406
Fat fuck.

1271
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,166
It's never easy, is it?

1272
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,245
No one wants to see that.

1273
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,246
Except for me, but I was born bad.

1274
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,847
Hold on. I have something for you.

1275
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,726
For your loyalty.

1276
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:10,202
- Oh, no, I don't want this, Mr. Chow.
- Okay, give it back, then. Come on.

1277
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,371
Quick! Before Stu smells it.

1278
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,010
I don't want it either, Chow.

1279
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,288
Oh, please.
Like a squirrel doesn't want a nut.

1280
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,611
It funny because he's Jewish.

1281
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,085
Don't you get it?

1282
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,244
Goddamn it.

1283
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:41,443
Okay, go on. Get out of here, all of you.

1284
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,923
Hey, chubster, I'll call you in a week.
We'll get together.

1285
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,321
No, Leslie, we can't be friends anymore.

1286
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,561
What?

1287
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,445
You're not good for me. It's not healthy.

1288
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,490
Alan, you're not thinking straight.

1289
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,845
Let's just talk tomorrow.

1290
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,890
Leslie, you're one of the coolest
and nicest guys I've ever met.

1291
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,203
And you're smart and you're funny
and everybody loves you.

1292
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,249
Alan. What is this?

1293
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,044
When we get together,
bad things happen and people get hurt.

1294
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:25,204
Yeah, that's the point. It's funny.

1295
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,408
Well, I've gotta make some changes in my life,
and this is one of them.

1296
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,050
I'm sorry.

1297
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,244
Farewell, Leslie Chow.

1298
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,324
You're cold as ice.

1299
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,606
Shotgun.

1300
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,883
Everybody okay?

1301
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,010
Yeah.

1302
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,841
Alan, you okay?

1303
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:11,051
Yeah.

1304
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,567
Good. Let's go home.

1305
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,124
Jesus Christ.

1306
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,485
You know what, guys?

1307
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,523
You can go ahead without me.
There's something I need to do.

1308
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,602
Do you even know how to get home?

1309
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,723
Of course I do. I'm a grown man.

1310
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,484
I'll ask a stranger.

1311
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,687
Good luck, Alan.

1312
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,964
We'll see you soon.

1313
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:43,170
Did you know that just a couple blocks
from here...

1314
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,324
...there's a place that looks exactly
like Paris, France?

1315
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:50,961
I can't remember what it's called,
but it's supposed to be magnificent.

1316
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,930
It's called Paris Hotel and Casino,
and it is magnificent.

1317
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,201
Yeah, that's it.

1318
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:58,409
Well, I'd like to take you to dinner there.
Tonight.

1319
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,082
Oh, sorry. No can do.

1320
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,251
Oh, well...

1321
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,607
I'm banned from the casino for life.

1322
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,444
Plus 10 years.

1323
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,930
I took Mom there for her birthday,
played a little blackjack.

1324
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,127
She split 10s.

1325
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,328
- Oh.
- I may have overreacted.

1326
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,289
They said it was abuse of an elderly.

1327
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,930
Ha, ha. I've done that.

1328
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,242
Heh. Right? Whatever.

1329
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,325
I can't go back there.

1330
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,291
But, uh...

1331
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:32,327
...Golden Nugget has the best prime rib
in town, if that's...

1332
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,688
Well, that sounds glorious.

1333
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,170
I'll send for you at 8:00.

1334
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,530
Is that it?

1335
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,247
I saw it once in a pornography.

1336
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,851
Oh.

1337
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,685
It's a nice gesture.

1338
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,370
But maybe we should wait.

1339
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,961
Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1340
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,810
I'll see you at 8.

1341
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,689
You look great, Alan.

1342
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,127
What do you think? Hat or no hat?

1343
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,486
Uh...

1344
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,927
- Hat. For sure.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

1345
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:20,322
Wow. Who's this guy?

1346
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,687
The vest and the cane? I love it.

1347
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,763
Thank you. Cassie picked it out for me.

1348
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:26,365
You look like Mr. Peanut.

1349
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,086
Yeah, I know, right?
That's what I was going for.

1350
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,921
- Maybe we'll just lose it.
- Yeah.

1351
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,084
Hey, Alan, I was just talking to Cassie.
She's an amazing woman.

1352
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,851
Oh, thank you for saying that.
She is an amazing woman.

1353
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,923
I find her much better than your wives.

1354
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,366
Aw. That's sweet.

1355
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,127
Which reminds me.
Um, we need to talk. Doug?

1356
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,364
All right, listen, fellas.

1357
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,411
Now that I'm getting married, I'm gonna be
spending a lot more time with Cassandra.

1358
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:57,246
- Yeah. It's the way it should be.
- No, you slow your roll, Phil, okay?

1359
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,447
There's more.

1360
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,568
And you're not gonna like this part.

1361
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,526
I must resign from the wolf pack.

1362
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,603
Wow, that's a big step, Alan.

1363
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:13,807
I know.

1364
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,208
But she's my soul mate.

1365
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,164
And my new best friend.

1366
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,606
Plus, she lets me mount her...

1367
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,371
...which relaxes me.

1368
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:24,721
Oh, my God.

1369
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,929
Alan, maybe never say that part again.

1370
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,122
Chillax, Doug, we're all adults here.

1371
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,726
I know you mount my sister.
I've seen it. Many times.

1372
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,571
What?

1373
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,246
Alan, you are the best.

1374
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,640
The point is:

1375
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,120
You need to let me go.

1376
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,925
You in particular.

1377
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,764
I can't be your hero anymore.

1378
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,129
Okay. Sure.

1379
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,291
Having said all that...

1380
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:56,529
...I still would like to get together
on Tuesdays for bowling...

1381
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:59,843
...and alternating Sundays
for general horseplay.

1382
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,810
- How about we play all that by ear?
- Alan, it's time.

1383
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,200
Here we go.

1384
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,250
Ready?

1385
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,280
I'm ready.

1386
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,689
What the fuck?

1387
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:06,967
Oh.

1388
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,730
Oh, my God.

1389
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,571
You guys.

1390
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,087
We're so crazy.

1391
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,482
I'm wearing women's underwear. Ha-ha-ha.

1392
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:28,211
Oh, my God. Ha-ha-ha.

1393
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:31,843
Stu, don't freak out,
but you need to look down.

1394
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,410
What?

1395
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,444
Oh, my God!

1396
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,807
- Ho-ho-ho.
- Aah!

1397
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,609
Oh, fuck!

1398
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,482
I have boobies now!

1399
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,687
Holy shit!

1400
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,205
It's not funny!

1401
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:56,281
Alan, what did you do?

1402
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,924
What did you do, Alan?

1403
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,610
The wedding cake.

1404
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,000
It was from Leslie.

1405
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:04,966
Oh, my God.

1406
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,044
We had a sick night, bitches. Heh-heh-heh.

1406
01:37:09,305 --> 01:38:09,932
