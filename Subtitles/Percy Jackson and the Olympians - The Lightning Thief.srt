1
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,543
Zeus.

2
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,258
Poseidon.

3
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,427
It's been many years.

4
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,266
What do you see?

5
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,938
Thunderclouds.

6
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,067
But no lightning.

7
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,572
Stolen.

8
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,411
What?
You think I took it?

9
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,373
Omnipotence has
blinded you, brother.

10
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,126
We are forbidden from
stealing each other's powers.

11
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,130
But our children aren't.

12
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,966
You're accusing my son?

13
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,887
I haven't seen him since he
was a baby. He doesn't know me

14
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,931
or even know who he is
because of you.

15
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,225
If your son
is the thief,

16
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,478
I will send him to
the depths of Tartarus.

17
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,816
If you touch him, you will
have the fight of your life.

18
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:03,575
He must return the
bolt to me in 14 days,

19
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,078
by midnight on the summer solstice,

20
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,087
or there will be war.

21
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,064
And he's alive!

22
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:04,446
Percy Jackson is a beast! You're
a beast, man! Give me some.

23
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,990
How long was that?

24
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,033
Seven minutes.

25
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,368
Seven minutes?
Mmm-hmm.

26
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,535
Oh.

27
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,538
That's crazy, man. That's
ridiculous. How do you do it?

28
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,457
I just like
being in water.

29
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,668
It's the one place
I can think.

30
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,128
Mmm-hmm.

31
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,684
I wish I could spend all day
underwater instead of this place.

32
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,105
Right. It's like high
school without the musical.

33
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,650
Every day it's the same
thing. Look at this.

34
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,118
Good morning.

35
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,371
I'm Mrs. Dodds, your
substitute English teacher.

36
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,415
Would someone
please explain

37
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,669
what Shakespeare was trying to
convey in this line from Othello?

38
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,173
Percy Jackson?

39
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,179
Well?

40
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,857
I'm sorry, I don't know.

41
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,901
Anybody else?

42
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,882
Hey, Mom,
I'm home!

43
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,717
I'm up here, honey!

44
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,012
Hi.
Hey, Mom.

45
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,346
How was school today?

46
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,764
The usual.

47
00:07:55,766 --> 00:08:00,061
I think this dyslexia
thing is getting worse.

48
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,272
Oh! Why do you
think that?

49
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,776
I don't know.
Maybe it's the ADHD.

50
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,488
You know,
I thought this school

51
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,656
was supposed to
make things better.

52
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,534
Percy, I know how hard this is for you.

53
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,411
But someday
it'll all make sense.

54
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,580
Really?

55
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,790
When? Hmm?

56
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,793
Tonight? Tomorrow? When?

57
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,713
Woman!

58
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,382
Hi, Gabe.

59
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,927
Where's my beer?

60
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,970
It's in the fridge.
So, what,

61
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,680
it's supposed to
magically float

62
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,807
from the icebox
and into my hand?

63
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,727
Hustle.

64
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,939
Come on, man. You have
to do that right here?

65
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,650
It's disgusting.
We're in a kitchen.

66
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,738
Yeah, real charmer
you got there. Really.

67
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,532
Show some respect,
all right?

68
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,450
That's my mom
right there.

69
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,669
This is my house.

70
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,673
You show some respect.

71
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,633
Oh, come on.

72
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,305
Why do you stay with that
pig? He smells like a sewer.

73
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,308
He sleeps till noon every day
and he can't even hold a job.

74
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,477
Why do you
stay with him?

75
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,858
He's been good to us, Percy,
in ways you don't understand.

76
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,488
You're right. I don't
understand. I don't get it.

77
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:06,021
POSEIDON: Be prepared. Everything
is about to change, Percy.

78
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,316
Everything is
about to change.

79
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,660
There are 12
Olympian gods.

80
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,541
The big three are the brothers
Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.

81
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:32,005
They attained power by
overthrowing their father, Kronos,

82
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,342
chopping him
into little pieces.

83
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,596
The three gods have
been rivals ever since,

84
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:44,059
always arguing,
always threatening war.

85
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,272
On several occasions, they would
come down to Earth and, um...

86
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,317
How shall I put this?

87
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,443
Hook up?

88
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,947
They would hook up
with mortals.

89
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:02,452
The children of these unions
were half god, half human.

90
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,539
Can anyone tell me
what they were called?

91
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,709
Percy.

92
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,755
Oh, I'm sorry. What?
What, Mr. Brunner?

93
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:19,719
What is the proper name of the
offspring of a human and a god?

94
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,348
Demigod.

95
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,432
Exactly.

96
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,435
And many became
great heroes,

97
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,772
like Hercules
and Achilles.

98
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,943
Can you name another?

99
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,073
I'll give you a hint.

100
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,450
You have something
in common.

101
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,962
Percy...

102
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,590
Perseus?

103
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,803
Correct.

104
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,932
Now, over here,
we have a depiction

105
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,601
of Hercules defeating
the Nemean lion.

106
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,523
Hercules killed the beast
with his bare hands

107
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,817
and took the skin
as a trophy.

108
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,652
Percy?

109
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,988
Yes, Mrs. Dodds?

110
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,823
We need to talk.

111
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,868
Okay.

112
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,661
The next 11 labors

113
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,122
would become
increasingly difficult.

114
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,000
It would take Hercules
three months...

115
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,218
So, did I do
something wrong?

116
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,722
Mrs. Dodds?

117
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,849
Hello?

118
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,185
Where is it?

119
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:55,315
Oh, whoa! Hey! Hey.
How did you get up there?

120
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,862
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

121
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,367
You stole
the lightning bolt!

122
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,203
I don't know what
you're talking about!

123
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,079
Give it to me!

124
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,501
Give it to me! Now!

125
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,212
Or I will bite
your heart out!

126
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,713
Percy!

127
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,090
Release him!

128
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,467
You!

129
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,679
Release him or I swear
I'll tear you to pieces!

130
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,153
I'm going crazy! Oh! I
should be on medication.

131
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,113
Percy, calm down, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay!

132
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,285
Oh, God, wait! Did
that really just happen?

133
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,703
She just turned
into that thing?

134
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:55,166
A Fury concealed in our
school. I should have known.

135
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,919
Wait, a Fury?
What's a Fury?

136
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,421
And why did you say you
could tear her to pieces?

137
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,340
What did she
want from you?

138
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,884
She said something

139
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,138
about me stealing
a lightning bolt.

140
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,267
They found him.

141
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,813
He's in danger.
Who found me?

142
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,941
He's no longer secure here.
Where should we move him?

143
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,442
We have no choice.
The Camp.

144
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,195
Huh? What camp? Look,
I'm standing right here.

145
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,030
If they think
he's the thief,

146
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,283
there's nowhere safe on
heaven and Earth for him now.

147
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,995
Percy, take this
to defend yourself.

148
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,832
It's a powerful weapon.
Guard it well.

149
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,460
Only use it in times
of severe distress.

150
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,257
This is a pen.
This is a pen!

151
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,385
Take him to his mother, and
don't let him out of your sight.

152
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,555
Okay. Percy, come on.
Come on, man. Come on!

153
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,806
Are you guys crazy?
Let's go!

154
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,433
This is a pen, man.

155
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,517
What do you want me
to do with this?

156
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,685
Come on!

157
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,520
Look, man,
what's going on?

158
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,771
Look,

159
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,317
don't trust anyone, okay? Don't
look at anybody, just keep walking!

160
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,861
Why did Mr. Brunner
ask you to watch me?

161
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,613
Because I'm your protector.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

162
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,115
My protector?
Are you kidding?

163
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,450
What, you think because I'm like this,

164
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,118
I'm not capable of
keeping you safe?

165
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,288
Maybe you're not seeing what
I'm seeing. You have crutches!

166
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,373
Look, I would give my life
to secure your well-being.

167
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,417
What are you talking
about? What's going on?

168
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,587
We got to warn your mom. Come on, Perce.

169
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,005
Come on!

170
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,050
Sally! More beer!

171
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,343
Mom!

172
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,387
Hey, Mom. Mom! Mom!
Look, we gotta talk, okay?

173
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,931
Hey!

174
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,308
Can't you see she's
servicing me and my friends?

175
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,602
Hey. Hey! Don't talk
about my mom like that,

176
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,103
you bald-headed freak.

177
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,813
No, Gabe! Gabe!

178
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,357
Calm down!

179
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,653
GABE'S FRIEND: Whoa!

180
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,862
Hey, nice one.

181
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,989
Like I said,
I'm your protector.

182
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,033
Yeah.

183
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:56,120
Sally, Percy has to leave
now. Like, right now.

184
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,705
Okay.

185
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,298
Look, what is happening? Okay,
I swear, I didn't steal anything!

186
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,051
Honey, I believe you.
I believe you.

187
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,054
Where are you taking me?
What is this camp?

188
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,932
It's a camp for really
special people,

189
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,809
like you.
"Special people"?

190
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,186
What, am I crazy
or something?

191
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,438
No, honey, no.

192
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,316
Percy, this is
about your father.

193
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,030
I was just
out of school

194
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,323
and working at
the Jersey shore

195
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,117
when we first met.

196
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,997
Your father was unlike
any guy I'd ever seen.

197
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,165
He was just dazzling.

198
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,668
Mmm. They're always dazzling.

199
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,087
We were really
in love, Percy.

200
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,800
And then you came along,
and then it was just perfect.

201
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,094
But he had to leave.

202
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,180
So he did abandon us.

203
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,851
No, honey, he was
forced to. He loved you.

204
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:05,106
Leaving you, it was probably the
most difficult thing he ever did.

205
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,785
Why did he have to go?

206
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,871
Because he's...

207
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,039
Sally, watch out!

208
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,708
Whoa!
Mom! Go straight!

209
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,467
Percy?

210
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,551
Mom, you all right?

211
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,719
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,970
Grover, you all right?

213
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,391
Is it me or is it
raining cows?

214
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,397
What is that?

215
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,942
Get out!
Come on! Come on!

216
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,320
Why are you taking your
pants off? What are you doing?

217
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,404
My job!

218
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,489
Whoa! Whoa!

219
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,823
You're half donkey?

220
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,241
I'm half goat.

221
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,499
Go, Grover!

222
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,375
Guys, watch out,
there's glass!

223
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,213
Come on, get out of the car!
That thing's getting closer!

224
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,547
You don't even
need these.

225
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,299
Look, man, those are just for show.

226
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,093
Follow me!
Whoa!

227
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:25,645
This way, guys! This way! Come
on! Come on! Come on, run! Run!

228
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,619
Come on! Come on!

229
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,792
We're here!

230
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,388
Mom! What are you doing?

231
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,639
This is as far
as I can go.

232
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,059
Come on! I can't go
through! I'm not like you!

233
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,769
Look, I'm not leaving
without you.

234
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,646
You have to!

235
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,022
You're meant to!

236
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,990
Put my mother down!

237
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,868
Percy, go! You're safe inside the gate!

238
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,786
What can I do?
Listen, use the pen!

239
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,122
What? Use Brunner's pen and click it!

240
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,791
Whoa!

241
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,689
Perce, are you okay?

242
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,286
Percy,
behind you!

243
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,551
Perce, you okay?

244
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,719
I'm not feeling...

245
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,054
Percy!

246
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,500
Perce, I'm sure glad you're alive.

247
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,672
Ow!

248
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,932
Where am I?
What is this place?

249
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,809
The infirmary.

250
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,560
You've been unconscious
for three days.

251
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,437
Three days?

252
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,858
So, Perce,
what do you remember?

253
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,488
Some crazy dream.
I don't know.

254
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,574
There was a monster.
My mom was there.

255
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,704
You were there, too, but you
were some weird hybrid man-goat

256
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,955
thing! Whoa!

257
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,211
Yeah. The politically
correct term is Satyr.

258
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,380
No.

259
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,050
No, no, no, no!

260
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,887
All of it was real?
My mom's gone?

261
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,809
I'm sorry, Percy.
I try, man, I really do.

262
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,315
But, frankly, I'm just a junior
protector. I don't have my horns yet.

263
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,736
It was my fault. It was
my job to protect you.

264
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,155
Both of you.

265
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,918
So this is
Camp Half Blood.

266
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,670
"Half" meaning what?

267
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,255
I think you know.

268
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,174
"Half" meaning "half mortal, half god. "

269
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,635
Fire! Whoa! Guys! Watch the arrows!

270
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,889
Newcomer! Hello! Gosh!

271
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,849
Look, man,
remember all the myths

272
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,018
about Greek gods
and goddesses?

273
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:38,105
Well, they're not myths. Look,
remember what Mr. Brunner said?

274
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,357
Sometimes they
come down to Earth

275
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,025
and they fall in love
with mortals?

276
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,152
And then
they have kids?

277
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:44,904
No way.

278
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,030
Yes way.

279
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:51,202
Yep, you're a demigod!
Two points for Percy Jackson!

280
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,288
Look, don't worry.
But you're not alone.

281
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,956
There's hundreds
in the world.

282
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,583
Some lead normal lives,

283
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,586
and some, I'm not allowed to
divulge their names, are very famous.

284
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,130
I'm talking about, like,
White House famous.

285
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,591
See, man,
this place right here,

286
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,885
this is the place where you'll
learn to harness your powers.

287
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,806
You'll train to become
leaders, warriors and heroes.

288
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,267
I think you have the wrong
guy, all right? I'm not a hero.

289
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,437
I'm a loser. I have dyslexia, ADHD.

290
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,689
And those are
your greatest gifts.

291
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,943
When you try to read, the
words float off the page, right?

292
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,361
That's because your
brain is hardwired

293
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,405
for Ancient Greek,
not English.

294
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,199
Like at the museum,
I could read.

295
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,535
Yeah. And your ADHD?

296
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:38,207
You're impulsive, Percy.
You can't be still!

297
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,876
Those are your natural
battle reflexes, man.

298
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,337
They kept you alive
in your fight.

299
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,841
Look, no pitiful loser
can defeat a Minotaur.

300
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,885
Your blood is special.

301
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,929
It's the blood of a god.

302
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,391
This is a lot to process.

303
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,685
Yeah, a lot. A lot.

304
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,859
This is where you'll do
most of your battle training.

305
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,624
What's her name?

306
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,545
She will squash you
like a bug.

307
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,422
Her name.

308
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,967
Annabeth. Daughter of
Athena, the goddess of wisdom.

309
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,141
Hey, no staring.
Keep it moving.

310
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,267
Keep it moving.
Come on.

311
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,393
Uh-huh.

312
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,399
There's someone I want
you to see. Check this out.

313
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,160
Oh, wow!

314
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,373
What are those things?

315
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,875
They're Centaurs.

316
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,254
Wait a minute.
Is that Mr. Brunner?

317
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,173
Come on.

318
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,385
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

319
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,723
Mr. Brunner?

320
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:21,060
In my world,
I'm known as Chiron.

321
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,604
Are you recovered?

322
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,105
Am I recovered?

323
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,901
You, you're not in
a wheelchair. You have...

324
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,862
A real horse's ass.

325
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,365
I apologize for
hiding my true form,

326
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:38,410
but I needed to keep an eye on
you. I hope you'll forgive me.

327
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,246
Come.

328
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,553
GIRLS: Hey, Grover!

329
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,558
Ooh. The daughters
of Aphrodite.

330
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,561
Okay. All right, guys. You guys
got a lot of catching up to do.

331
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,522
Their mother is the goddess of
love, so you know where that leads.

332
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,149
Hey, baby! Whoo!

333
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,484
Satyrs.

334
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,989
What is this place?

335
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,783
Welcome home.

336
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,661
Your father
built this for you.

337
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,999
Wow.

338
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,967
This whole place
is mine?

339
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,526
This thing's got
some weight to it.

340
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,118
My father is Poseidon!

341
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,870
God of the seas.

342
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,748
Why didn't anybody
tell me?

343
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,000
It was for
your own safety.

344
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,629
It's exceedingly rare
for a child to be born

345
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,839
to one of
the big three.

346
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,093
You're very powerful.

347
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,220
A threat.

348
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,681
A threat?
Who am I threatening?

349
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:28,354
Poseidon's brothers,
Zeus and Hades.

350
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,567
That's why your mother
married your stepfather.

351
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,029
His pungent odor masked
the smell of your blood

352
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:43,994
and hid you from anything or anyone
the gods would send to kill you.

353
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,415
My mother put up with
that creep to protect me?

354
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,000
Mmm-hmm.

355
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,963
I wish I'd known.

356
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,092
She sacrificed
so much for me.

357
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,681
Now she's gone.

358
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,815
Why am I even here?

359
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,484
CHIRON: You're here
because you're in jeopardy.

360
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,195
Everyone thinks you're
the lightning thief.

361
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,322
Look, I didn't steal it.

362
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:28,205
Zeus' bolt is the most
powerful weapon ever created.

363
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,334
And if it's not returned by
the summer solstice, in 10 days,

364
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,419
there will be a war.

365
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,671
This is your problem,
all right? Not mine.

366
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,548
This is about
your world, not mine.

367
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,591
This is about
all worlds!

368
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,262
Olympians would be forced
to choose sides.

369
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,139
Earth would become
a battleground.

370
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,475
Mountains erupted,
earthquakes, raging fires!

371
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,729
The end of life
as you know it.

372
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,278
What can we do?

373
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,405
I want to take you
to Olympus,

374
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,449
convince Zeus of
your innocence.

375
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,827
Someone's using you
to start a war.

376
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,748
What are we doing here?
Let's go now.

377
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,334
Your boldness is commendable,
but outside those gates

378
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,963
you would be in danger
at all times.

379
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:22,009
The Fury and the Minotaur
were only the beginning.

380
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,138
First, we must train.

381
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,354
This is always
a fun game to watch.

382
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,150
Ow! God, how do you guys wear
this stuff? It weighs more than me.

383
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,527
Look, trust me. Wear
it or you'll get killed.

384
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,488
Wait. What?
What? Wait...

385
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:46,700
CHIRON:
Heroes! Warriors!

386
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,076
Fall in!

387
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,043
Hustle, hustle!

388
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,254
Dylan, Paris,
stop lollygagging!

389
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,801
Percy. Step forward.

390
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,683
This is Percy Jackson!

391
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,521
And he's going
to need a team.

392
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,648
We'll take him.

393
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,988
I'm Luke. Son of Hermes and camp leader.

394
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,741
Not necessarily
in that order.

395
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,660
Where's your helmet?

396
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,662
No one gave me one.

397
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,543
Chiron, you still got your
wheelchair? Kid's gonna need it.

398
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,461
You're a goner, man.

399
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,924
I'm messing with you. Smile a
little bit. It's good for you, kid.

400
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,177
Anybody got an extra
helmet? Please pass it up.

401
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,641
Try it on.

402
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,395
That'll protect you.
So will all of us.

403
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,439
Welcome to the Blue Soldiers, my friend.

404
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,485
CHIRON: All right! Everyone in
position for Capture the Flag!

405
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,905
First team to capture
the enemy's banner wins.

406
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,199
Dismissed!

407
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,412
RED SOLDIER LEADER:
Steady, steady!

408
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,955
Now!

409
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,934
Percy, I know where
the flag's at. Come on!

410
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,525
Keep your eyes open.
Don't get killed.

411
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,235
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa!

412
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,751
I'm coming, buddy, I'm coming!
Sons of Ares. Watch out!

413
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,003
Whoa, that's a sword!
That's a sword!

414
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,176
Oh, you guys take camp
way too seriously.

415
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,303
Go!

416
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,653
Percy, get out of here!
Go look for the flag!

417
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,738
How did I just do that?

418
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,092
No.

419
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,771
I won.

420
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,649
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

421
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,068
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

422
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,201
My mother is goddess of
wisdom and battle strategy.

423
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,162
Do you know
what that means?

424
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,206
I always win.

425
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,377
I always lose.
Maybe we're both wrong.

426
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,172
Ow!

427
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,099
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

428
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,189
Okay, Chiron, shouldn't we
get in there and stop them?

429
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,357
She's killing him, man.

430
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,775
You've got
to be kidding.

431
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,485
This is the best part!

432
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,536
Stand up and fight,

433
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,706
hero.

434
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,181
Come on, Perce.
Come on, Perce.

435
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,065
POSEIDON: Go to the water.

436
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,825
The water will
give you power.

437
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,764
Yeah, Perce!

438
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,743
Get up there.

439
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,411
GIRL: All right! Yeah!

440
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,205
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

441
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,208
Ladies and gentlemen, the son
of Poseidon is coming through.

442
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,752
A hero is coming through! Move it!

443
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,088
Hey, no dirty looks.
Stop that.

444
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,297
Sorry, I'm trying...

445
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,924
Hey, Percy?

446
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,343
We're having a party
at our place later.

447
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,303
And we would really love it if you came.

448
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,763
I'd love to come.
That'd be great.

449
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,306
That would be amazing!
Awesome.

450
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,684
I would love to come,
too, to the party.

451
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,602
You know? Thanks for
inviting me, ladies.

452
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,271
Beat it, nymphs.

453
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,357
Wait, don't leave.
Ladies... I'm available.

454
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,403
Wait, come on, don't leave. I'm
available! What time's the party?

455
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,779
Feeling like a hero?

456
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,656
More like a mutant.

457
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,659
I'm not gonna grow a fish tail or
gills or anything like that, am I?

458
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,160
Not likely.

459
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,455
Although a huge ego
isn't out of the question.

460
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,877
You know you could have
killed me out there?

461
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,297
I could have died,
if I was normal.

462
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,965
But you aren't.

463
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,760
I get the sense that you
don't like me very much.

464
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,431
It's possible. I mean, our
parents hate each other.

465
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,640
Wait. They do?

466
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,725
Mmm-hmm.

467
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,769
I definitely have
strong feelings for you.

468
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,982
I just haven't decided if
they're positive or negative yet.

469
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,236
Well, you let me know
when you figure it out.

470
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,197
You'll be the first.

471
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,679
Percy Jackson,
show yourself!

472
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,202
Hades! Stay back!

473
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:38,166
Percy Jackson,
bring me the bolt!

474
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,463
Be a good boy.

475
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,967
Hand it to me and I will
exchange it for your mother.

476
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:52,180
Percy!
Don't listen, Percy!

477
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,602
My mother's gone!

478
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,482
No, your mother
is still alive.

479
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,527
I sent the Minotaur
to abduct her.

480
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,446
She is here with me
in the Underworld.

481
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,454
Mom?

482
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,665
Percy?

483
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,631
What have you done
with my mother?

484
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:31,052
If you ever want to see your mother
again, you will bring me the bolt!

485
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,977
Chiron, I have
to go get her.

486
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,980
Percy, you don't
have the bolt.

487
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,648
Look, I'll tell
him the truth!

488
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,818
When he realizes I'm not
the thief, he'll release her.

489
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,612
No. You cannot
negotiate with Hades.

490
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,490
When he finds out
you don't have the bolt,

491
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,034
he'll kill you
and your mother.

492
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,619
This is her only chance.

493
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,037
No.

494
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,039
Stick to our plan.

495
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,335
Travel to Olympus,
bargain with Zeus.

496
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,296
Once you convince him
of your innocence,

497
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,341
we will do everything in our
power to bring back your mother.

498
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,970
Okay.

499
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,655
Going somewhere?

500
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,617
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm going for a walk.

501
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,035
Oh, for a walk?
I'm coming with you.

502
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,661
No, no,
I'm going alone.

503
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,787
No, I'm coming
with you.

504
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:40,872
No!

505
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,874
You're being followed.

506
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,213
You're stressing me out.
Leave me alone.

507
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,547
We got a 1:00 demigod curfew, okay?

508
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,591
Leave me alone. Go
to sleep or something.

509
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,800
No.

510
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,844
Come on.
One small victory

511
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,012
and you're ready
to fight Hades?

512
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,055
Ooh, double team.

513
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,223
Really? You, too?

514
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,184
Look, I just found out
my mother is still alive.

515
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,352
I'm gonna get her back.

516
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,436
From the Underworld?

517
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,729
Whatever it takes.

518
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,397
Huh. Yeah, well, maybe
you'll outsmart Hades.

519
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,815
Maybe I will.
Look, man,

520
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,067
I can't let you
do this, okay?

521
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:12,278
Look, I'm not asking
for your permission.

522
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,323
Okay. Well, according
to regulations,

523
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,408
if I can't stop you,
I must accompany you,

524
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,953
'cause I'm your best friend
and your protector.

525
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,246
Junior protector.

526
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,790
Is that
really necessary?

527
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,000
I don't need
your help. Okay?

528
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,293
This is something I
have to do on my own.

529
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,379
Yeah, well, we weren't
asking for your permission.

530
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,465
Come on, all right? Today
you tried to kill me.

531
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,925
Now you want
to defend me?

532
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,176
That wasn't real.

533
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,095
That was just training.
Yeah.

534
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,555
Percy, that's all
I've ever done,

535
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,640
is train and train
and train.

536
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:44,352
I've grown up here. I've only been in
the outside world a couple of times.

537
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,522
And I've never had the chance
to go on an actual quest.

538
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:51,651
Besides, you've won one
battle and I've won hundreds.

539
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,403
You're gonna need
my experience.

540
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,196
Good point.

541
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,367
You two really
want to come?

542
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,868
Yes!
Yeah!

543
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,247
Okay. I guess
we're all going.

544
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,250
So who knows how to
get to the Underworld?

545
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,837
I did not think
of that one.

546
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,340
I think I know
someone who might.

547
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,468
MAN'S VOICE:
Friendly Harriers inbound!

548
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,724
Luke?
Hmm?

549
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,269
Hey, guys.

550
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,565
Percy. I figured you'd
stop by sooner or later.

551
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:34,569
Everybody does, just to
get away from all that

552
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,739
Renaissance fair stuff
out there, you know?

553
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:43,828
But welcome to
the modern world.

554
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,789
Cool. New stuff.

555
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,628
What are you
guys up to?

556
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,838
We're going to
get my mom back.

557
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,715
Oh!

558
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,009
Your dad is
the messenger of the gods,

559
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:01,971
one of the only ones who's gotten
in and out of the Underworld.

560
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,765
Do you have any idea how?

561
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:08,144
Mmm. My dad's a jerk.
I've never met him.

562
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,562
You, too?

563
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,356
Guess we all got
Daddy issues, huh?

564
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,652
That's because all gods
are the same. Selfish.

565
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,154
They only care
about themselves.

566
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,992
But I once broke into my dad's
house. Got some cool stuff.

567
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,673
For you.

568
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,766
Whoa!

569
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,769
Flying shoes?

570
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,020
Mmm-hmm.

571
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,147
They're my dad's.

572
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,901
He has hundreds of
these little guys.

573
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,197
He won't even miss them.

574
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,700
Look underneath
the other one.

575
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,581
You see, people have gone
to the Underworld before

576
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,208
without having to be dead.

577
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,710
Hercules did it.
Orpheus did it.

578
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,545
My dad does it
all the time.

579
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,463
Getting in's the easy part.

580
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,507
Getting out,
now that's tricky.

581
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,136
This is a map to
Persephone's pearls.

582
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,180
Persephone?
You mean Hades' wife?

583
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:29,767
Yeah, he forced her to marry
him. Keeps her prisoner.

584
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:33,688
Needless to say, she hates it
there. It's hot, he's a weirdo.

585
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:37,066
So she has, um,
secret visitors.

586
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,901
Hmm!
Mmm!

587
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,612
She keeps pearls hidden
for them all over the world,

588
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,739
and these pearls,

589
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,782
they provide a quick escape
from the Underworld.

590
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,577
You could use them
to get out.

591
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,328
So, how do
the pearls work?

592
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,788
Easy.

593
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,666
You take a pearl, you
step on it, you crush it,

594
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,835
visualize where you
want to be taken.

595
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,920
Right now, there's three
pearls in the United States.

596
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,255
This map will
guide you there.

597
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,132
Right here is
your first location.

598
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,512
"Auntie Em's
Garden Emporium. "

599
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,264
Once you find
the first pearl,

600
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,724
the map will show
you the next one,

601
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:12,393
and the next one, and
then you're off to Hades.

602
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:16,063
Which reminds me.
You guys

603
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,692
might need some
extra protection, so...

604
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:26,365
My favorite shield. You might
want to take a step back.

605
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,999
Mmm.

606
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,211
Hey. Thanks, Luke.

607
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,213
Ah, don't mention it.

608
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,800
But you're gonna have to
promise me one thing.

609
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,886
If you see my dad on
the highway to hell...

610
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,095
Yeah?

611
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,222
Kick his ass for me.

612
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,895
I'm on the highway to hell

613
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,273
Highway to hell

614
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,610
I'm on the highway to hell

615
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,323
Highway to hell

616
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,912
Don't stop me

617
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,422
This place definitely
needs an extreme makeover.

618
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,220
Hello!

619
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,851
Hello? Anybody home in Auntieville?

620
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,895
Check this out.
They got free sodas.

621
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,527
Okay. That's nasty.

622
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,155
The Health Department needs
to give this place an F.

623
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,911
Hey, guys,
check this out.

624
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,505
Look at this.

625
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,300
Nice.

626
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,094
Gold drachmas.

627
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,929
That means we're on
the right track.

628
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,806
Here.

629
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,851
How are we gonna find
the pearl in this place?

630
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,394
That's a good question.

631
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,397
Okay, let's split up.
Check everything.

632
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,607
Good idea.
Yeah.

633
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,108
I'm gonna go this way.

634
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,906
Hello?

635
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,632
Get out!
She's coming!

636
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,175
What? Who?

637
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,179
We stopped... Directions...
My poor husband! Help me!

638
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,680
Please, help me!

639
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,611
Check this out. He looks
just like my Uncle Ferdinand.

640
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,198
That's crazy.

641
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,284
He got the mole
in the same place.

642
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,579
No. It's not
my Uncle Ferdinand,

643
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,915
because Uncle Ferdinand
was killed by

644
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,668
Medusa.

645
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,297
Percy! Annabeth!

646
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,465
We're in trouble!

647
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,633
Grover?

648
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,223
Please! We have to leave
before she finds us!

649
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,349
Who?

650
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,725
She's turned
my husband to stone!

651
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,727
Grover! Where are you?

652
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:46,065
Percy! Annabeth!

653
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,442
Annabeth, where are you?

654
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,860
Grover!

655
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,324
Come on, man,
watch where you're going!

656
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,742
Perce! Listen.

657
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,995
Where are we?
We're in Medusa's lair.

658
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,330
Annabeth!
Annie!

659
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,749
We're lost!
We'll never leave!

660
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,418
Don't move.

661
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,509
Well, this is
a fabulous surprise.

662
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:19,181
It's so heartening to
have such young visitors.

663
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,268
We get so lonely here.

664
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,104
Don't we?

665
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:30,109
That's why I create
my statues.

666
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,447
They're my only company,

667
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,951
daughter of Athena.

668
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,536
How do you know me?

669
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,123
You have such
beautiful hair.

670
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,919
I once had hair
like that.

671
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,797
I was courted,

672
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,260
desired by
many suitors.

673
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,805
But that all changed

674
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,225
because of your mother,

675
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,312
the woman who cursed me.

676
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,231
Who turned me...

677
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,027
Don't look!

678
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,904
...into this!

679
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,826
They say the eyes
are windows to the soul.

680
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:25,331
I hope you find my eyes

681
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,835
attractive.

682
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:36,675
So rude, not looking
people in the eyes.

683
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,096
Come on.

684
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:45,142
Sneak a peek.

685
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,539
How are we supposed to fight
something we can't look at?

686
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,958
We can look
at a reflection.

687
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,293
Okay, wait.
Check this out.

688
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,046
All right. Good idea.
I'm gonna go get Annabeth.

689
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,214
Okay, I'm gonna
take care of Medusa.

690
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,465
Okay.

691
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,678
You'll make a wonderful
addition to my collection.

692
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,223
We'll be
friends forever.

693
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,225
Do you mind?

694
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,230
Oh, no, no.

695
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:41,824
Sooner or later you
will open those eyes.

696
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:49,081
The temptation to look at
me is too hard to resist.

697
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,750
Don't look, Annabeth!
Don't open your eyes!

698
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,254
Who's that?

699
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,923
Another demigod?

700
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,723
Mmm.

701
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,767
I can sense you.

702
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

703
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,869
Whoa!

704
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,621
Mmm.

705
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,373
Son of Poseidon.

706
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,295
I used to date
your daddy.

707
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,934
Need a hand?

708
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,644
Grover. Help.

709
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,815
Thanks. Okay.
Come on. Let's go.

710
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,493
I hear you have
the lightning bolt.

711
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,828
May I see it?

712
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,122
I don't have it!

713
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,920
Let me see your eyes.

714
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,840
I hear they're bluer
than the Circassian Sea.

715
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,843
Open them,

716
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:30,432
or my hungry babies will
have to open them for you.

717
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:36,272
But it would be
such a pity

718
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:41,610
to destroy such a
young and handsome face.

719
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:47,783
Stay with me, Percy.

720
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:54,039
All you have
to do is look.

721
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,141
Are you okay?

722
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,812
Yeah, I'm okay.

723
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,738
Son of Poseidon!

724
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,545
Heads up.

725
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,761
Hey, guys! It's cool
to open up your eyes!

726
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:55,100
Annabeth, that was great,
great demigod driving.

727
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,602
Thanks.

728
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,981
We should
take it with us.

729
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,025
The head?
Oh, no. That's sick.

730
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,779
If you open the eyes, they
still work, dead or alive.

731
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,947
You never know when something
like that might come in handy.

732
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,116
Yeah, you're right.
But I'm not touching it.

733
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,826
Come on, man, just take off your jacket.

734
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,204
We'll wrap it up
until we get some ice.

735
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,373
Why do I got to
take off my jacket?

736
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,249
Because you're
the protector.

737
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,877
Yeah, you're right.
I am the protector.

738
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:25,631
So I'm gonna give you my
hoodie, not my jacket. Okay?

739
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,133
Come on, you baby.

740
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,804
Disgusting.

741
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,972
Yeah, just toss it up.
Come on, don't...

742
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,394
Hey. Hey. Guys, wait.

743
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,938
The pearl.

744
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,237
One down, two to go.

745
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,076
Would have been nice if Luke
had warned us about Medusa.

746
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,662
Maybe he just
didn't know.

747
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,289
GPS from the gods.
Where to next?

748
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,834
Let's see.

749
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,341
The Parthenon
in Nashville.

750
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:14,179
Nashville? Oh, great. Home
of my least favorite music.

751
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,098
Yee-haw!

752
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,856
I make believe

753
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,860
that the sight of her
in my head's seldom seen

754
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,496
Let's stop for the night! Yeah.

755
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,123
Good idea.

756
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,207
Oh, my God.

757
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,227
Percy.

758
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:26,210
Hey.

759
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,046
Nice work today.
Thanks.

760
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,342
What happened to you?

761
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:37,513
Oh, that poor lady who
turned to stone, she...

762
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,390
She had a tight grip.

763
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,019
Check this out.

764
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,910
Cool. Very cool.

765
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,622
So,

766
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,708
why do our parents
hate each other?

767
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,795
They both wanted to be
patron god of Athens.

768
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,465
And the people
chose Athena.

769
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,469
And our parents have hated
each other ever since.

770
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,680
What's your mom like?

771
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,348
I don't know.

772
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,474
I never met her.

773
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,520
What? Is it like
this for everybody?

774
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,565
Don't any gods
see their kids?

775
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,483
It's forbidden.

776
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,236
Right after we were born, Zeus decreed

777
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,407
that the gods couldn't have physical
contact with their mortal offspring.

778
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,492
Oh, that's a stupid law.

779
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,244
I agree.

780
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:47,457
Although, between us,

781
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,504
I think my mother
speaks to me sometimes.

782
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,257
In times of trouble,
I hear her voice

783
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,758
giving me advice.

784
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,343
That's happened to me!

785
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,305
Yeah. That's your father talking to you.

786
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,767
Yo, Percy! Get in
here, man! This is ugly!

787
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,271
Right.

788
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,356
Hey, hurry up!

789
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,318
Perce, check this out, man.

790
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,278
You're on TV.

791
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,697
...surrounding the
missing boy, Percy Jackson,

792
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,699
and his mother,
Sally Ugliano.

793
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,869
But their relatives have
some interesting theories.

794
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,622
So, Mr. Ugliano, talk to me
about your son, Percy Jackson.

795
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,041
No, he's not my son.
He's a stepson.

796
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,543
He did not come
from these loins.

797
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,087
Ever since he started with
the drugs and the alcohol,

798
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,464
he's never been the same. Oh, no.

799
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,007
Five nights ago,
he tried to kill me

800
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,550
and he threw his mother
on the ground.

801
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,011
And his cripple friend
then attacked me

802
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,388
from behind
and knocked me out.

803
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:47,559
When I woke up, Sally was gone.
She was kidnapped by Percy.

804
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,644
She would never
leave with that...

805
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,811
Oh, shut up, Gabe.

806
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,648
Great.
Now I'm a fugitive.

807
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,650
See? That's what
I'm talking about, man.

808
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,652
Gabe's always
running his mouth.

809
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:59,655
He's just mad because I
busted him up with my crutches.

810
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,658
Guys,

811
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,578
I can't pee
with her watching me.

812
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,343
Sorry, guys.
I messed up.

813
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,011
I should have
closed the curtains.

814
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,429
Come on, guys.

815
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,973
Let's hit the road before
Homeland Security shows up.

816
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,720
Wow, that's amazing.

817
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,806
A complete replica of the
Parthenon in Nashville.

818
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,142
All right, guys.
Let's go get the pearl.

819
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,114
Wow.

820
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,626
Hey. That's your mom.

821
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,422
I wonder if she really looks like that.

822
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,510
We'll find out.

823
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:53,101
Guys, check this out.
Oh, man.

824
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,646
It's the pearl.

825
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,278
That was easy.

826
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,946
Easy?

827
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,617
It's 30 feet in the air and this
place is filled with tourists.

828
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,204
I got an idea.

829
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:15,707
We'll come back after the place
closes. Come on, follow me.

830
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,084
Or I can just throw
my crutch up there.

831
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,795
I'm saying, the pearl
would fall out... Grover!

832
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,798
Perce, I'm saying...
It's not a bad idea!

833
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:40,232
The park's been closed
for an hour. Let's move.

834
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,691
Yes, sir!

835
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,820
All right, this will be easy. Okay.

836
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:47,239
I'm gonna fly up. I'm gonna
use Luke's flying shoes.

837
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,907
I'm gonna grab the pearl, and... Cool.

838
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,075
Oh!

839
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,835
Okay, so what are
we going to do?

840
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,879
All right, guys.

841
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,340
I got this.

842
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,759
You got what?
Hey, yo, hey, listen!

843
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:08,927
You're going to
kill the janitors?

844
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,011
Chill.

845
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,180
Those are working-class Americans!

846
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,229
Oh, man.

847
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,238
Oh. Why did
you do that?

848
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,031
They're not dead,
they're unconscious.

849
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,491
Now, we have 30 minutes.
Come on!

850
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,118
Cool.

851
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,799
Y'all, what's cracking?

852
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:48,967
Hey.

853
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:50,635
Luke!

854
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,845
Annabeth!

855
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,555
How do you
turn on the shoes?

856
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,724
Tell Percy he's got to
break into a run, okay?

857
01:04:55,808 --> 01:05:00,645
He's got to build up speed,
kind of like a jet on a runway.

858
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,814
It's gonna take
some practice.

859
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,316
Okay.

860
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,651
I got this.

861
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:08,987
Whoa... Whoa!

862
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,822
It's gonna take
some practice!

863
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,658
Whoa!

864
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:19,080
Oh! Whoa. Whoa.

865
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,604
I got it!
Yes!

866
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,356
Yeah, Percy!
There we go!

867
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,111
There it is.

868
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,279
Yeah!

869
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,781
That's what
I'm talking about.

870
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:53,823
Way to go.

871
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,075
All right,
let's grab everything...

872
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,368
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

873
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,205
Oh, man.

874
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,129
Look, I got this, okay?

875
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,882
Hey, guys, I'm with
Park Recreational Services.

876
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,385
You guys have been caught sleeping
on the job. You better be happy

877
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,553
I'm not writing you guys up,
okay? This is the last time.

878
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,390
We've been expecting you,
Mr. Jackson.

879
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,725
Not again.

880
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,062
Just give us the lightning
bolt and we'll let you go.

881
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,731
Look, I don't have
the lightning bolt.

882
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,193
Okay. This is bad.

883
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,588
Hydra!

884
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:53,842
Guys, watch out! The
middle one spews fire!

885
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,262
Whoa!

886
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:21,953
Oh, you got a sweet tooth?
All right! Try that!

887
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:44,142
Whoa!
Percy, stop! No!

888
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,479
Whoa!

889
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,490
How flipping
awesome was that?

890
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,574
I just killed
that thing!

891
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,993
Killed it?
You only made it worse.

892
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,286
What are you
talking about?

893
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,580
Percy, when you cut
off one Hydra head,

894
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,248
two more grow back.

895
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,633
Get back!

896
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:21,513
Distract that thing!
I'll get the pearl!

897
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,886
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

898
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,666
Let's go!

899
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,585
Let's go! Come on!

900
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,338
Go!
Open the door!

901
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,257
The door won't open!

902
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,092
Grover!

903
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:20,340
That's nasty.

904
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:26,054
We interrupt our regularly
scheduled programming

905
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,181
for this special report.

906
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,808
Scientists are baffled
by what now appears to be

907
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:35,104
a single storm cloud that is
expanding over much of Europe and Asia,

908
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,190
moving towards
the United States.

909
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,484
Savage winds,
rain and mammoth waves

910
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,277
are being reported
along the coastlines

911
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,737
of several continents.

912
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:47,408
So far, no casualties, but countries
everywhere are preparing for the worst.

913
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,452
The gods are angry.

914
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,287
We need to get
the last pearl.

915
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,538
Where's the next location?

916
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,790
Yeah.

917
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,334
Well, let's see.

918
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:00,713
Well, guys, we got ourselves a good one.

919
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,007
We're going to Vegas!

920
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,203
Yo!

921
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:40,503
Oh. There it is.

922
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,256
Lotus Casino.

923
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,941
I've been
looking forward to this!

924
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:05,153
Look, guys, remember, always split
the eights, never the tens, okay?

925
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,821
We're not here to
gamble, remember?

926
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:09,157
We got poker,
we got blackjack...

927
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,492
Grover, we're not here to have fun.

928
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,202
We just need to grab
the pearl and go, okay?

929
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,579
All right.

930
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,417
This is nice!

931
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:32,055
A little less conversation,
a little more action, please

932
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:35,308
All this aggravation
ain't satisfactioning me

933
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:38,770
Okay, this place
is officially dope.

934
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,813
Here's your complimentary
Lotus Fun Book.

935
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,690
Thanks,
but we're not staying.

936
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,985
Please, I insist. It's good for
everything in the hotel and casino.

937
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,654
Don't comp us.
We're not checking in.

938
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,531
Okay, that guy
was persistent.

939
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,075
Yeah!

940
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,412
Yeah, we're here for one
thing and one thing only.

941
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:57,914
Wow.

942
01:12:57,998 --> 01:12:59,207
That is really
awesome.

943
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:04,962
Where would we find a
green pearl in this place?

944
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:08,466
Maybe on a cocktail
waitress or a showgirl.

945
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,259
We should start there.

946
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:17,725
Can I get you something? Try a
lotus flower. They're so good.

947
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,060
It's our signature dish.

948
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,646
Oh. Really?
Signature?

949
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,023
Is it good?

950
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:26,401
Thank you.

951
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,902
Yo, do we have to
pay for this?

952
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:31,197
I guess we don't.
It's free.

953
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,327
Mmm. That's really good.

954
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:45,837
Mmm. Wow. This is the most
delicious thing I've ever consumed!

955
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,976
I wanna hold 'em
like they do in Texas, please

956
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,020
Wow.

957
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,730
Fold 'em let 'em hit me,
raise it, baby, stay with me

958
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:05,857
I love it

959
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,483
Love, game, intuition,
play the cards

960
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,318
Guys, why don't we
stay here for a while?

961
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,528
Yeah!

962
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,113
That sounds like
an amazing idea.

963
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:19,203
But we're on a time-sensitive
mission right now.

964
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:22,457
Aren't we...

965
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,958
I can't remember.

966
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:26,169
I totally forgot
what I was gonna say.

967
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,922
I think I figured it out. I
think I know why we're here.

968
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:31,299
Why are we here?

969
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:32,550
To have fun.

970
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,595
Okay. Let's never leave!

971
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,889
Yeah!
Let's stay here!

972
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,684
Can't read my
Can't read my

973
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:45,396
No, he can't read
my poker face

974
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,440
She's got to love nobody

975
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,775
Can't read my
Can't read my

976
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,612
No, he can't read
my poker face

977
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,905
Whoa!

978
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:56,616
Yeah!

979
01:14:57,075 --> 01:15:03,080
Poker face, poker face

980
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:18,179
I'll get him hot,
show him what I got

981
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:19,847
You're awesome!

982
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,016
Can't read my
Can't read my

983
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,645
No, he can't read
my poker face

984
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,980
She's got to love nobody

985
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:29,982
Can't read my
Can't read my

986
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:33,528
No, he can't read
my poker face

987
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,488
Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh!

988
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,949
Thanks.
Thank you! Thanks.

989
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:42,286
POSEIDON: No, Percy.
Don't eat the flower.

990
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:47,291
It dulls the senses,
keeps you prisoner here.

991
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,920
Hey, I think I'm gonna go get
some air. I'll be right back.

992
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:52,296
Okay.

993
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,219
WAITRESS:
Another lotus flower?

994
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:00,137
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

995
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:07,270
POSEIDON: Look around you. Focus. Focus!

996
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,354
Another lotus flower?

997
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:09,480
No, thank you.

998
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:13,943
Would you like another one? I'm fine.

999
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,201
The French Connection, huh?

1000
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:24,328
Yeah.
You seen it yet?

1001
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:27,665
Yeah, yeah,
I think so, on DVD.

1002
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:29,834
What's DVD?

1003
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:32,837
Seriously?

1004
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,923
Whatever. I think it's
the best movie of the year.

1005
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,968
What? Wait.
This year?

1006
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,347
Yeah, this year. 1971.

1007
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,523
POSEIDON: Percy, wake up.

1008
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,234
You need to escape.

1009
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,360
Wake up!

1010
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,445
You could really use
a lotus flower.

1011
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,696
I really
don't want one.

1012
01:16:58,822 --> 01:16:59,864
Thank you.
Just one.

1013
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,198
No!

1014
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:17,340
Another lotus flower?

1015
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:18,466
No.
We insist.

1016
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:21,218
I really don't want another lotus
flower, so please, leave me alone.

1017
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:23,554
Is there a problem,
Mr. Jackson?

1018
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:27,558
No. Thank you.

1019
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,024
Percy Jackson's awake.

1020
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,196
Excuse me.
Annabeth. Annabeth!

1021
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,198
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What're you
doing with that? Don't eat that.

1022
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:43,449
What?
We have to go. Now.

1023
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:44,784
What do you mean?
We're having so much fun!

1024
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,953
No, no, no, we're not having
fun. Grover! Grover! Wake up!

1025
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,955
Grover! Come on,
we got to go!

1026
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,958
What? Look, Perce, your
timing is terrible, okay?

1027
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,087
Dude, we're heading to the
chapel. We're getting married!

1028
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,755
How romantic!
No, no, no, no, no.

1029
01:17:57,881 --> 01:17:59,757
Hey, which of y'all
did I propose to?

1030
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,427
Wake up!

1031
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:06,222
Yo, man, you're such a buzz kill.

1032
01:18:06,306 --> 01:18:08,140
Percy, what's wrong with
you? Why are you doing this?

1033
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:09,767
Both of you need
to wake up, now!

1034
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:13,062
Look at me. Look at me. You're
in a trance, okay? We're trapped!

1035
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:14,939
Listen to me.
If you eat the flowers,

1036
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:16,982
you're never gonna
want to leave. Okay?

1037
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,943
We're gonna be
stuck here forever!

1038
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:20,653
Oh.

1039
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,531
Oh, no.
We got to go.

1040
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:24,865
Okay, I see
your point! Okay.

1041
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,158
Let's get
the green pearl!

1042
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:35,167
Hold it right there!
Stop right where you are.

1043
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:59,608
Move, James Dean! Out of the
way! Let's go, guys! Car! Car!

1044
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,153
Come on, guys! Car!

1045
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,572
Get in!

1046
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,866
Come on, come on! In the
car, in the car! Let's go!

1047
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:07,992
Keys! Got the keys.

1048
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,076
Come on! Go!

1049
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,286
Drive! Drive!

1050
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,454
They're coming!
They're coming!

1051
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,080
Come on, start driving!
I got this.

1052
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:14,373
Go!

1053
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:39,148
Now, that's how you get out of
a casino! That's how you drive!

1054
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:41,358
Of course.
Now that all makes sense.

1055
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:42,443
What?

1056
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:43,819
That was the lair
of the lotus eaters.

1057
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:46,655
They've been luring people into
their trap since ancient times.

1058
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,492
Guys, look.
Tomorrow is June 21 st.

1059
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:52,328
No. No, no. It can't
be. Today's the 15th.

1060
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:56,457
No, tomorrow is the 21 st. We
were in there for five days.

1061
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:57,666
It felt like hours.

1062
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,001
Then tomorrow's
the solstice.

1063
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:00,961
Our deadline is
tomorrow at midnight.

1064
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,714
Okay, look, we've got to
move it. Where's Hades?

1065
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,848
It's in Hollywood.

1066
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:16,185
All right. I can get
us there in four hours.

1067
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:17,770
Maybe three.

1068
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:49,093
MAN ON RADIO: And now, the
latest breaking news from KZLY.

1069
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:53,180
An unprecedented storm cloud has
grown to cover most of North America.

1070
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:56,058
Authorities in several states
are ordering evacuations,

1071
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:58,060
reporting severe
weather conditions.

1072
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:07,444
Don't slip.
Watch your step.

1073
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,990
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait. Hold it.

1074
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:19,164
"Woe to all
depraved souls. "

1075
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:53,741
Well, I guess there
ain't no turning back now.

1076
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:56,368
Yep. Looks like
we're stuck in here.

1077
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,037
Yeah.

1078
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,967
Hey, Perce, who's that
creepy guy with the hoodie?

1079
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:14,345
I don't know.
Let's find out.

1080
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:20,976
Who are you?

1081
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,770
We need to see Hades.

1082
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:24,855
The living are
not permitted here.

1083
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,691
Die and come back.

1084
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:32,154
Okay, we won't die
and come back, but...

1085
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:36,867
You know what?
I think I know what he wants.

1086
01:22:36,993 --> 01:22:38,285
What?

1087
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,454
You got to pay
the ferryman.

1088
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:41,705
Watch this.

1089
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:45,042
Yo, my friend!
What up?

1090
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:49,713
Okay, guess not. Look, you
like dead people, right?

1091
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:52,591
I got a few dead people
you might recognize.

1092
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:55,094
Check this out.
Jackson, Grant.

1093
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,681
And look who's joining the
party. Benjamin Franklin.

1094
01:22:58,765 --> 01:22:59,974
Yeah, you like that,
don't you?

1095
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:02,726
Look, you give us a boat
ride, you take the money

1096
01:23:02,852 --> 01:23:04,144
and you get
an interior decorator,

1097
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,479
'cause it is too
depressing in here.

1098
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:07,439
All right?
Here you go.

1099
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,032
That was $170!

1100
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:20,744
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. The drachma. The drachma!

1101
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:32,131
Climb aboard.

1102
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,633
Thanks for telling me, man, you're
burning money. We're in a recession.

1103
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:37,219
That's treason. Just shut
up. Shut up, man. Go on.

1104
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,948
Welcome to
the Underworld.

1105
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:04,288
What is all this?

1106
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,500
The scrapheap
of human misery.

1107
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,837
Lost hopes and dreams.

1108
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:16,258
Wishes that never
came true.

1109
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:34,151
All lives end in suffering and tragedy.

1110
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:04,681
This is as
far as I go.

1111
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:26,411
Guys, do you
hear that?

1112
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:27,496
Yeah, what is that?

1113
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,622
I don't know.

1114
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:35,921
Annie, stab that thing!

1115
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,214
What are we gonna do?

1116
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,384
Back!

1117
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:45,639
What were those things?

1118
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,099
Hellhounds.

1119
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:50,102
Yeah, well, maybe you should feed them.

1120
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:53,230
They sensed the presence
of another animal.

1121
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:55,149
Great, they smell goat.

1122
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,942
Hmm. A Satyr.

1123
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,447
I haven't had a Satyr

1124
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,076
visit before.

1125
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,870
Persephone!

1126
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:10,455
What could possibly
be taking so long?

1127
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,624
Don't ignore me!

1128
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:16,295
Or what?
What will you do?

1129
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:18,755
I'm already in Hell.

1130
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,111
We have visitors.

1131
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,490
Nephew.

1132
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:58,629
Welcome.

1133
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,633
You have your
father's looks.

1134
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:07,054
Always the lucky
side of the family.

1135
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:10,474
Wait. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1136
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,683
You're Hades?

1137
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:12,935
Yes.

1138
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:17,064
Sorry. I just didn't expect
you to look like this, man.

1139
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:19,149
Kind of stylish.
I like it.

1140
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:22,527
Would you prefer
that I looked like this?

1141
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:30,994
No! No! Look, stick to the Mick
Jagger thing! It works for you!

1142
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:42,506
You're very
brave coming here.

1143
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:45,008
Come closer.

1144
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,388
Hey. Perce.

1145
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,390
I can see the look of
disgust in your eyes,

1146
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:53,809
but this existence
was not of my choosing.

1147
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:58,563
I was banished here by Zeus
and your father. I am damned.

1148
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,566
My only chance of
getting out of this place

1149
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:05,362
is to defeat my brothers and take
control of Olympus. But, of course,

1150
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:07,864
I'll need the bolt.

1151
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:10,325
And I need my mother.

1152
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:11,868
Then we have
an understanding.

1153
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:14,663
You give me the bolt and
I'll give you your mother.

1154
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:21,044
I need to tell
you the truth.

1155
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:25,257
I'm not the lightning
thief. I don't have the bolt.

1156
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:26,842
I never did.

1157
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:30,220
Why did you
come here, then?

1158
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,224
Well, I was hoping

1159
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:38,478
that when you saw that I wasn't
the thief, you'd let my mother go.

1160
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:41,440
Yes. Yes, but do you think I'm an idiot?

1161
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,651
I'm Hades!

1162
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:48,280
Now, give me the bolt,
or say goodbye to your mother!

1163
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:14,264
Percy!

1164
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:24,691
I thought
I'd lost you forever.

1165
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:25,901
No.

1166
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,968
Zeus' master bolt.

1167
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:57,766
Liar.

1168
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,644
I swear, I don't know
how that got there.

1169
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:02,062
That's not even
my shield!

1170
01:30:02,146 --> 01:30:03,230
No!

1171
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:04,523
Luke rigged it!

1172
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,983
He put the bolt in
his shield and used us.

1173
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,819
Luke stole
the lightning bolt.

1174
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,196
I think we're done here.

1175
01:30:12,448 --> 01:30:14,157
Feed them to the souls.

1176
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,047
Whoa! Whoa!

1177
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:32,926
We had a deal, all right? You
have the bolt! Just let us go!

1178
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,761
Summon the hounds.

1179
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:38,014
Ella tho!

1180
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:39,975
No. No ella tho.

1181
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:45,021
Lassie, sit! Sit!

1182
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,526
No! No!

1183
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:54,656
I am going to be
king of the gods.

1184
01:30:55,491 --> 01:30:58,160
Stay back! Stay!

1185
01:30:58,494 --> 01:30:59,870
Stay!

1186
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:10,213
All right, come on.

1187
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:12,549
Go on, give it back.

1188
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,193
Bad dog!

1189
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,907
He won't
remember a thing!

1190
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:40,911
Why did you do that?

1191
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:45,248
Because he's cruel
and abusive!

1192
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,834
The only thing
I look forward to

1193
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,921
is my allotted time
away from this hellhole.

1194
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:54,424
A war of the gods
would put an end to that.

1195
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:58,553
And I'd be alone,
with only him,

1196
01:31:59,555 --> 01:32:00,805
forever.

1197
01:32:03,392 --> 01:32:06,561
Go. Take the bolt,
and your mother.

1198
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:19,115
Only three?

1199
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:22,661
Oh, no.

1200
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,829
There are four of you.

1201
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:27,916
Each pearl transports
only a single person.

1202
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,253
One of you
will have to stay.

1203
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:34,673
All right, I'll stay.
You three go. What? No.

1204
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,550
No, no, no.
I've achieved

1205
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:38,260
my quest. I'm staying here. No. No!

1206
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:40,178
I've trained for
situations like this.

1207
01:32:40,304 --> 01:32:42,347
Guys! Guys.
Knock it off.

1208
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,724
I'm staying, because
I'm the protector.

1209
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,268
Grover, come on.

1210
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:48,895
Look, man, I don't want
to hear it. Just go.

1211
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,480
It's my duty.

1212
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:53,149
It's what I'm meant for.

1213
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:55,443
We'll come back
for you.

1214
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:59,489
I'll take very
good care of him.

1215
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:02,742
All right.
Now move it, guys!

1216
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,787
Each of you, step on a pearl and
concentrate on where you want to go.

1217
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:07,289
Take this.

1218
01:33:08,499 --> 01:33:09,874
To Olympus.

1219
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:42,532
Ooh!

1220
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:12,604
Hey. Look.

1221
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:21,196
Zeus and Poseidon
preparing for battle.

1222
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:24,324
Oh, no, no.
This isn't the right place.

1223
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:26,284
This isn't Olympus.
This is...

1224
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:27,619
This is the
Empire State Building!

1225
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:30,413
Percy! The entrance
to Olympus is there!

1226
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:32,832
Well, there's 10 minutes
till midnight. Let's move.

1227
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,709
Percy Jackson!

1228
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:44,928
Well, you weren't supposed
to make it out alive.

1229
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,932
I can't let you take
that bolt to Olympus.

1230
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:51,476
I'm the lightning thief.

1231
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:54,979
You hid the bolt
in my shield. Why?

1232
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:59,192
Well, when you said you were
going to the Underworld, it hit me.

1233
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:02,821
"That is the perfect opportunity
to get the bolt to Hades. "

1234
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,531
Why would you do that?

1235
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:07,075
To bring Olympus
crumbling down.

1236
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:09,661
Percy, let's go.

1237
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:11,996
Let's go!

1238
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:15,709
Well, it's too late, 'cause I'm
returning the bolt to Zeus right now.

1239
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:17,627
Not before midnight.

1240
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:53,788
You all right?
Yeah.

1241
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,710
Luke! Why do you want
a war of the gods?

1242
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:01,379
Control.

1243
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:05,175
They've been in power
for too long.

1244
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:08,386
I say it's time for our
generation to take over.

1245
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:11,014
Remold the world
in our image.

1246
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,932
A world of new heroes.

1247
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,434
You're no hero.

1248
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:24,360
Huh!

1249
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:33,036
Mom, are you all right? Yeah.

1250
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:36,122
Stay here.

1251
01:36:58,437 --> 01:36:59,562
Luke!

1252
01:38:41,206 --> 01:38:43,166
Maybe they were wrong.

1253
01:38:44,543 --> 01:38:47,003
Maybe you're
no son of Poseidon.

1254
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:15,758
Yeah. I think I am
the son of Poseidon.

1255
01:40:38,657 --> 01:40:42,785
He's got the bolt! Come on!
Let's move! We've got two minutes!

1256
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:26,079
Olympus.

1257
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:35,880
Percy, I can't get
through. You've got to go!

1258
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:54,273
Silence!

1259
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:09,831
It is almost midnight.

1260
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,541
This was predestined!

1261
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:13,376
You wanted this battle!

1262
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:15,253
You have only
yourself to blame!

1263
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:19,966
Please! Let's be rational.
War is not the answer!

1264
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,138
Time has run out.

1265
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:26,389
Wait!

1266
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:28,975
Wait! Wait!

1267
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:31,561
Wow.

1268
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:42,989
My name is Percy Jackson, and I
think you might be looking for this.

1269
01:42:59,923 --> 01:43:02,466
Give me the bolt,
lightning thief.

1270
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:16,939
You're wise to
betray your father.

1271
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:21,736
I didn't steal it. And I have
no connection to Poseidon.

1272
01:43:22,321 --> 01:43:27,033
But tell me, if you didn't
steal it, then who did?

1273
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:29,952
Luke, son of Hermes.

1274
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:36,000
You see,
he was angry at you.

1275
01:43:36,084 --> 01:43:37,919
All of you.

1276
01:43:38,003 --> 01:43:40,880
He wanted you to
destroy yourselves.

1277
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:53,726
You have done well.

1278
01:44:06,573 --> 01:44:08,366
Let there be peace.

1279
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:14,455
Hi, Mom.

1280
01:44:15,165 --> 01:44:19,085
Annabeth,
I am so proud of you.

1281
01:44:22,214 --> 01:44:25,383
Zeus, I have
a good friend.

1282
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:29,220
He's a Satyr
named Grover.

1283
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:30,805
He's my protector,

1284
01:44:30,889 --> 01:44:33,266
and the only reason why
we escaped the Underworld

1285
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,893
is because
he stayed behind.

1286
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:40,356
And now you expect me
to bring him back.

1287
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:44,819
Very well.

1288
01:44:47,739 --> 01:44:51,409
I believe this assembly's
business here is finished.

1289
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:56,664
Brother, please. I
need to speak with him.

1290
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:02,253
Just this once.

1291
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:16,058
I'll meet you outside.

1292
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:29,196
I'm not expecting you
to forgive me.

1293
01:45:30,365 --> 01:45:33,117
But I want you to know
that I'm grateful.

1294
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:35,202
I didn't do it for you.

1295
01:45:35,954 --> 01:45:37,830
I did it to save Mom.

1296
01:45:45,088 --> 01:45:48,132
Please. We don't have much time.

1297
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:54,347
How old was I
when you left?

1298
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:56,682
Seven months.

1299
01:45:58,268 --> 01:46:01,729
Look, I didn't need you
there all the time, but...

1300
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:06,442
I would have liked to
have seen you just once.

1301
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:11,697
Why didn't you
ever come back?

1302
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:18,913
I wanted to.

1303
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:22,541
When I was with you
and your mother,

1304
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:25,920
I became less concerned
with my responsibilities.

1305
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:28,506
I was becoming human.

1306
01:46:30,675 --> 01:46:32,218
And that's a bad thing?

1307
01:46:32,302 --> 01:46:34,470
For a god?
Zeus thought so.

1308
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:36,222
That's why
he passed the law

1309
01:46:36,306 --> 01:46:39,809
preventing gods from ever having
contact with their children.

1310
01:46:41,603 --> 01:46:43,270
That was because of you?

1311
01:46:47,609 --> 01:46:49,735
But I was always
watching over you.

1312
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:52,988
Just because
you didn't see me

1313
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:55,533
doesn't mean that
I wasn't there.

1314
01:46:56,284 --> 01:46:59,161
When you were troubled,
I tried to help.

1315
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:02,289
I heard you.

1316
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:05,584
I know I'm not the father
you always wanted,

1317
01:47:06,628 --> 01:47:09,922
but if you ever need me,
I'll be there for you,

1318
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:12,299
in your thoughts

1319
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:14,176
and in your dreams.

1320
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:18,180
I'll stand by you, Percy.

1321
01:47:19,391 --> 01:47:20,641
Always.

1322
01:47:46,918 --> 01:47:49,086
You can come
visit me anytime.

1323
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:52,381
Just promise me that I don't have
to see that loser Gabe ever again.

1324
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:53,883
I kicked him out.

1325
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:57,720
Yeah, he's gone. He's
out of our lives forever.

1326
01:47:59,222 --> 01:48:00,222
Finally.

1327
01:48:06,062 --> 01:48:07,146
Oh!

1328
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:08,689
I'm going to
miss you.

1329
01:48:08,773 --> 01:48:09,857
Me, too.

1330
01:48:17,866 --> 01:48:19,074
Percy?

1331
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:22,703
This is where you belong.

1332
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:35,508
Good job, man.
Thanks, Perce.

1333
01:48:36,384 --> 01:48:39,011
Ready! Aim!

1334
01:48:39,095 --> 01:48:41,013
Hey, whoa, Perce... Watch it! Hey!

1335
01:48:41,097 --> 01:48:42,598
You guys gonna kill the
man who saved the world?

1336
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:45,434
Great job. All you guys,
take a lunch break. Thank you!

1337
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,687
So, the conquering hero
returns, triumphant.

1338
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:50,606
Grover.
Hey!

1339
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:52,274
You notice anything
different about me?

1340
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:53,692
No.

1341
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:58,113
You sure? Anything
that's improved about me?

1342
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:00,950
No. What,
you've been working out?

1343
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:03,035
What, you get a new
cologne? You smell good.

1344
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:04,787
Look, man.
I got my horns!

1345
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:06,622
Oh! I was seeing them
the whole time.

1346
01:49:06,748 --> 01:49:09,208
I mean, look at that thing. You
got little horns in your head.

1347
01:49:09,292 --> 01:49:10,459
Right?
Crazy.

1348
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:11,961
Zeus came through,

1349
01:49:12,045 --> 01:49:14,213
and now I'm Senior
Protector, First Class, baby.

1350
01:49:14,297 --> 01:49:16,799
Congratulations.
Definitely earned them.

1351
01:49:16,925 --> 01:49:18,133
Thank you, man.

1352
01:49:20,136 --> 01:49:23,639
CHIRON: Keep moving, keep
moving! Don't lose interest!

1353
01:49:23,765 --> 01:49:25,224
One foot in front
of the other,

1354
01:49:25,308 --> 01:49:27,268
and the next thing you
know, you're running!

1355
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:30,896
Percy.

1356
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:37,319
You left the camp. You
disobeyed my orders.

1357
01:49:38,655 --> 01:49:40,656
Yeah, about that.

1358
01:49:40,782 --> 01:49:42,241
Which is why

1359
01:49:43,618 --> 01:49:45,244
you're my
favorite student.

1360
01:49:46,621 --> 01:49:50,082
You can receive all the training
in the world, but ultimately,

1361
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:52,418
you have to follow
your instincts.

1362
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:54,336
Grace under pressure.

1363
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:01,135
All right. Time to train. Go suit up.

1364
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:03,178
You might be
a big shot on Olympus,

1365
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:06,432
but down here, you're still
just one of my students.

1366
01:50:06,516 --> 01:50:07,808
Move it.

1367
01:50:10,478 --> 01:50:12,354
Nice horns, Grover.

1368
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:15,774
I'm serious, man. We
talked, we wooed, we dined,

1369
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:16,817
we had a great time!

1370
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:17,901
Well, I'm happy
for you, you know?

1371
01:50:17,986 --> 01:50:20,529
Persephone might really
like me. I'm serious.

1372
01:50:26,369 --> 01:50:28,621
I think you can handle
this one on your own.

1373
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:30,205
Uh-huh.

1374
01:50:30,332 --> 01:50:31,874
All right, Perce.

1375
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:36,295
Hey, Perce, awesome
job, man. Hey, thanks.

1376
01:50:36,379 --> 01:50:37,546
Good job.
Thanks.

1377
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:42,384
Good job.

1378
01:50:51,519 --> 01:50:52,811
Who's next?

1379
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:01,153
I think I'd like
to give it a shot.

1380
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:14,541
Welcome home.

1381
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,508
Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

1382
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,095
First rule of
battle strategy.

1383
01:51:26,596 --> 01:51:29,223
Don't ever let your
opponent distract you.

1384
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:12,159
Sally, open the door!

1385
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:14,411
Open up!

1386
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:19,333
You changed the locks?

1387
01:53:19,417 --> 01:53:20,501
Yes.

1388
01:53:21,211 --> 01:53:23,212
So, here's your junk.

1389
01:53:23,338 --> 01:53:24,296
You can
let yourself out.

1390
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:25,422
Well...

1391
01:53:26,341 --> 01:53:29,259
How am I supposed to move
all this stuff by myself?

1392
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:31,428
Deal with it.

1393
01:53:36,267 --> 01:53:37,851
I need a beer.

1394
01:53:41,773 --> 01:53:44,066
What? "Do not open..."

1395
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:50,197
That little brat.

1396
01:53:51,407 --> 01:53:53,575
Well, I may not
live here anymore,

1397
01:53:54,536 --> 01:53:56,745
but I'm still the king
of this castle.

1398
01:58:35,691 --> 01:58:36,733
