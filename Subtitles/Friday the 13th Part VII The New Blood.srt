00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,330
There's a legend around here:</i>

3
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:44,376
<i>A killer buried but not dead.</i>

4
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,256
<i>A curse on Crystal Lake.</i>

5
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,383
<i>A death curse.</i>

6
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,679
<i>Jason Voorhees' curse.</i>

7
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,189
<i>They say he died as a boy...</i>

8
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,983
<i>...but he keeps coming back.</i>

9
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:16,408
<i>Few have seen him and lived.</i>

10
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,290
<i>Some have even tried to stop him.</i>

11
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,668
<i>No one can.</i>

12
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,569
Jason's alive.

13
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,827
He's even more powerful now.

14
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,672
Jason belongs in hell
and I'm gonna see he gets there.

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,257
Jason, come on!

16
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:17,928
Come and get me!
It's me you want, remember?

17
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,984
<i>He is down there, waiting.</i>

18
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,571
- Don't give me that.
- Please.

19
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,198
- I'm gonna sell this place and get out.
- Tina?

20
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,784
- Hey, leave her out of this.
- Tina, come inside.

21
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:31,163
- Yeah, come on, join the party.
- Please, don't drink any more.

22
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,873
Don't tell me what to do!

23
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,340
Tina?

24
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,261
Tina, come inside, honey.

25
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,972
Tina!

26
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,772
Wait! Tina!

27
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,826
Tina, don't.
Please, honey, come back.

28
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:14,581
- You hit Mom again.
- Tina! Tina!

29
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,209
I hate you! Go away!

30
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,003
Please, baby, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

31
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,549
Go away. I hate you!
I wish you were dead!

32
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,731
Oh, my God!

33
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,617
No!

34
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,453
No, Daddy. No!

35
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,130
John!

36
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,309
Daddy!

37
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,772
Tina, honey, are you all right?

38
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,941
I'm fine.

39
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,406
I don't think this is such a good idea.

40
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,076
Tina, honey, this is really
hard on all of us.

41
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,036
Will you just give it a try?

42
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,873
It doesn't seem to be so
hard on Dr. Crews.

43
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,875
He really wants to help you, Tina.

44
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,669
I'd hate to see you go back
to the hospital.

45
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,713
I guess you're right.

46
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,191
There he is.

47
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,487
- "Bad News" Crews.
- Tina.

48
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,031
- Hi, Dr. Crews.
- Hi.

49
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,991
I hope we didn't keep you
waiting too long.

50
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,454
No, no, I really
like it up here. It's beautiful.

51
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,458
- Did you have a good trip?
- It was a very nice drive.

52
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,462
- Hi, Tina. How are you?
- Hi.

53
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,636
- Hi.
- There goes the neighborhood.

54
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,474
Nice outfit.
Looks like her mom dressed her.

55
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,559
Melissa.

56
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,191
So this is where it all started.

57
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,485
Well, well, well.

58
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,703
Dr. Crews, you really think that
we're doing the right thing, don't you?

59
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,122
We've done all we can do for her
at the hospital.

60
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,791
She hasn't made enough progress.

61
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,004
I know it's tough on both of you
to come back here, but trust me.

62
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,298
We'll do the best we can.

63
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,801
You'll help her.

64
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,431
So, what do you think of Nick?

65
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,434
Gee, I hadn't noticed.

66
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,813
Oh!

67
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,190
- Let me help.
- That's all right. I can do it.

68
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,608
- No, really, here.
- Really.

69
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,943
No, it's no problem.

70
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,615
- Uh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

71
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,285
- Here.
- Thanks. You've been a great help.

72
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,080
I don't know what I would've done
without you.

73
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,172
Great, asshole.

74
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,510
Do we really have to do this now?

75
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,055
Tina, we're late already.
Just sit down, please.

76
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,904
- Why am I seeing things?
- I don't know, Tina.

77
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,741
Why do you think you're seeing things?

78
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,415
Is that really necessary?

79
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,209
What, the camera?

80
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,504
I just wanna keep track
of our progress, all right?

81
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,423
Now, uh....

82
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,761
Let's get back to work, all right?

83
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,306
Tina, look at me.

84
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,849
See this matchbook?

85
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,561
I'm gonna set it on the desk here.

86
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,565
I want you to concentrate.
I want you to think about your feelings...

87
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,694
...and just focus them in
on the matchbook.

88
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,905
And maybe we can get it to move.

89
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,094
- You're not trying, Tina.
- Yes, I am.

90
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,014
Think about it moving and make it move.

91
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,314
I can't! I told you,
I don't know how it happens.

92
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,692
Sometimes it happens
and sometimes it doesn't!

93
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,486
And you're lying to me!

94
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:41,658
You are lying, because it happens
when your emotions are at their peak.

95
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,869
Come on, you're holding back.
Concentrate.

96
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,497
Concentrate, Tina!

97
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,178
Well, well. What did you do?

98
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,682
What went through your mind?

99
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,559
I was thinking about you.

100
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,605
Look, I don't know how
any of this is gonna help me.

101
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:16,985
Your psychokinetic ability is a projection
of the suppressed guilt feelings you have.

102
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,611
Would you speak English?

103
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,323
You're more interested in this
telekinetic stuff than you are in me!

104
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,742
That is not true, Tina.

105
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,662
I'm here to help you overcome the guilt
that you have about your father's death.

106
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,956
- That's all.
- That's bullshit!

107
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,922
I rest my case.

108
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,392
- Hey.
- Yes?

109
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,688
If this is my uncle's house,
why are we sleeping in the van?

110
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,734
Who says we're sleeping?

111
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,125
Tina.

112
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,920
Honey, are you all right?

113
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,923
- Mom, I miss him so much.
- I know, I miss him too.

114
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,138
Tina!

115
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,549
<i>Please, baby, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.</i>

116
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,097
- Tina!
- I hate you! I wish you were dead!

117
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,016
John!

118
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,893
I wish you were dead!

119
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,980
No, Daddy. No!

120
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,482
I'm sorry, Daddy.

121
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,443
I'm so sorry.

122
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,906
I wish I could bring you back.

123
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,587
Daddy?

124
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,990
Dr. Crews, it's Tina!

125
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:56,079
- Tina, sweetheart, are you all right?
- Tina, what happened?

126
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,747
Where is he?

127
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,128
Dr. Crews, I saw him,
but I can't describe him.

128
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,672
But you said "him."

129
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,967
Are you saying a man came
out of the lake?

130
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:13,137
I know what you're thinking,
but this has nothing to do with my father.

131
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,101
Tina...

132
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,938
...don't run away from it.

133
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,650
Your guilt over your father's death is....
Well, it's a powerful thing.

134
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,318
But it wasn't my father.

135
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,904
Your mind is manufacturing
hallucinations because--

136
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,490
- It wasn't a hallucination.
- Yes, it was.

137
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,534
No!

138
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,418
Piece of shit.

139
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,131
When's the last time
you put oil in that thing?

140
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,508
Yesterday.

141
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,144
- Let's just camp here.
- But we're almost there.

142
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,355
- Jane, woods is woods and I'm beat.
- Michael!

143
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,359
What? We're gonna have to go back
to the car in the morning anyway.

144
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,737
- Nick can take us.
- Nick?

145
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,989
What would he be doing out here?

146
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,867
- He's already here.
- What are you talking about?

147
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,870
This was supposed to be
a surprise party for your birthday.

148
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,874
Everybody's waiting for us to show up.
I got this great cabin and everything.

149
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,334
No way.

150
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,004
Never mind, the whole thing's ruined.

151
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,422
Happy birthday.

152
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,847
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,725
I washed this for you.

154
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,853
- Hi.
- Hi.

155
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,355
- I'm Nick.
- I'm Amanda Shepard. Nice meeting you.

156
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,150
- Nice to meet you.
- So have you been having fun up here?

157
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,235
Yeah, a bunch of us got together...

158
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,113
...to throw my cousin Michael, heh,
a surprise birthday party.

159
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,450
- I came over to invite your daughter.
- I don't know.

160
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,287
Well, you can always spend
the evening with me and Dr. Crews.

161
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,834
- Let's go, heh. Bye.
- Bye. Have a good time.

162
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,798
Where'd she go? Uh, who's that boy?

163
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,051
Oh, relax, Dr. Crews, she's just
going to visit the kids next door.

164
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,137
But I thought we agreed,
no distractions. I mean, I'd....

165
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,306
I'd hate to send her back
to the hospital.

166
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:25,394
She just needs a chance to be normal.
Isn't that what this is all about?

167
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,522
Yes, of course it is.

168
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,234
This is some birthday.

169
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:35,321
It's gonna be a great birthday. Promise.

170
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,923
Hey, be back in two shakes.

171
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,092
Just hurry.

172
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,744
Michael, get a move on.

173
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,789
- Christ! It's cold out here!
- Ha, ha.

174
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,493
Jane?

175
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,636
A party. You know,
cake and ice cream.

176
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,681
Oh, shit! Nick, help me out.

177
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,849
- Whoa! Got it.
- I need an objective opinion.

178
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,478
- No, grab it underneath. It's wet.
- Is anybody making the popcorn?

179
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,607
What do you think of Starlycon?

180
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,486
Thirty thousand years into the future,
the entire galaxy is populated...

181
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,989
- ...by highly evolved protozoa.
- Thanks a lot.

182
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,407
- Good, huh?
- You all right?

183
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,409
Only one human
being and his woman...

184
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,203
- ...still exist amongst the stars.
- Just give me a drink.

185
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,289
I see you met our resident writer, Eddie.

186
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,791
- Ice cream and cake, huh?
- Just something with alcohol.

187
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:38,629
Eddie's a little out there, Tina, but believe me,
everybody else here, perfectly normal.

188
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,851
So he goes, "Let me see your ID."
So I go, "Well, I left it at home."

189
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,146
And he goes, "You have to go
and get it." So I go, "Okay." And I go.

190
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,066
Put something under that drink, all right?
You're gonna ruin the table.

191
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,611
- Outrageous.
- You like him?

192
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,822
Me too.

193
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,534
What is this?
Ah, will you look at this?

194
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,202
The party hasn't even started...

195
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,748
...and already this place looks like
closing time at the stock exchange.

196
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,585
- Russ, honey, we'll clean it up. I promise.
- Yeah, chill out, Brooks Brothers.

197
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,756
But they're eating my uncle's food.
We're supposed to bring our own food.

198
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,342
He's gonna shit.

199
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,973
- Everybody, this is Tina from next door.
- You guys!

200
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,184
- Hi.
- Hi.

201
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,811
- Ow.
- Oh, shit!

202
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,021
Fuck!
Where did that come from?

203
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,439
- What was that?
- Nick, help me.

204
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,192
- Tina....
- Why are these people such slobs?

205
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,152
Trouble.

206
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,906
Now, there's a guy I'd love
to give a surprise party for.

207
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,742
- Hi, I'm Melissa.
- I'm Tina, from next door.

208
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,452
I know.

209
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,496
Whose friend is that scuzzball dopehead?

210
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,373
Only the birthday boy's best friend.

211
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,793
Melissa, those are so pretty.
They're absolutely gorgeous.

212
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,005
- What a stupid place to put a lamp.
- They're real.

213
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:07,385
On my last birthday, my daddy goes,
"Melissa, you're the perfect daughter."

214
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:12,306
And he gives me these and says,
"To the best little girl in the whole world."

215
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,477
Ah, disgusting.
Look, it's all over me.

216
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,199
- Tina, wait a minute. Come back here.
- Who is that girl?

217
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,369
Nick, let me tell you
something about women.

218
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,676
- Mom?
- Tina? Honey, what is it?

219
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,386
- Mom, I saw him again.
- Who? What?

220
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,721
The man, the thing in the lake,
I saw him again.

221
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,807
He was killing a boy with a metal spike.

222
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,268
Tina, relax, relax. Relax, relax.

223
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,311
What do you mean, you saw "it"?

224
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:04,108
Well, I didn't actually see it,
but I know. I know.

225
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,569
Okay.

226
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,821
What were you doing
right before it happened?

227
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,490
- Why?
- Because these are delusions.

228
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,909
Tina, you're creating images
of your father.

229
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,204
All right. Well, he left a large delusion
stuck in our back porch.

230
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,748
Why don't you just go look,
if you don't believe me.

231
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,958
All right. Okay.

232
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,627
Okay, I will.

233
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,840
- Tina....
- I know I'm right. I'm right.

234
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,808
Tina? Mrs. Shepard?

235
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,228
Tina, where? I....

236
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:51,113
But it was here. It was right here,
the large spike that I saw.

237
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,453
What's happening to me?

238
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,830
Help me, please.

239
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,540
Shh, shh, shh.

240
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,168
I'll help you,
but you have to help me.

241
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,630
Honey, come on in the house.
Come on, sweetie. Come on, in the house.

242
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,632
- It was there.
- Okay.

243
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,468
It was there.
I just don't know what's happening.

244
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,762
It's okay.

245
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,680
It's okay.

246
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,687
I'm cold.

247
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,982
- Why don't we crawl in the sack?
- Why don't you fix the fire?

248
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,528
- There's no wood.
- Heh, we're in a forest.

249
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,697
Come on, let me heat you up.

250
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,701
Dan, we need wood.

251
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,580
It's gonna be a cold night tonight.

252
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,670
I'll be back.

253
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:24,683
Okay, you big hunk of a man,
come and get me.

254
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,104
Dan?

255
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,781
Dan, what are you doing?

256
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,480
It was great.

257
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,358
Derrick F. Z. Simms' greatest film.

258
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,028
<i>The Battle of the Gargantuan Throngar
was a work of genius.</i>

259
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,280
- Right, Eddie.
- Hey, you don't have to take...

260
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,908
- ...my word for it. Ask Ben, he was there.
- What?

261
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,577
Ben, why don't you tell us
all about Throngar.

262
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,498
- Throng what?
- Oh, no, my mistake. lt wasn't Ben.

263
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,085
Gee, look at the time.
Gotta get moving, get something on paper.

264
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,213
Uh, some surprise party
that turned out to be, huh?

265
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,799
Michael probably got pulled over
for drunk driving...

266
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,467
...and spent the night in jail.

267
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:44,179
I mean, the guy can smell a party
1 00 miles away. He'll be here.

268
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,225
- Now, where's my coffee?
- Where would you like it?

269
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,061
Has anyone seen Nick?

270
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,815
I think he went next door
to see Marilyn Munster, heh.

271
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,993
Your friends must think
I'm a complete joke.

272
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,538
Yeah, who cares what they think?
They're not my friends.

273
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:14,376
I just came up for my cousin.
So where are you from?

274
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:18,172
- Where are you from?
- We're doing real good here, aren't we?

275
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,216
Okay, here goes.

276
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,845
I grew up in Pittsburgh,
I used to hang out with a real bad crowd.

277
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:29,767
Then my dad kicked me out and now
I go to night school. Your turn.

278
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:35,481
We used to come up here all the time
till my dad got killed in the lake.

279
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,109
I don't like it here.

280
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,451
Oh, is this where...?

281
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,454
I think it was my fault.

282
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,123
I know it was my fault.

283
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,336
Look, you're a really nice guy
trying to get your life together.

284
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,837
You don't wanna mess around with me.

285
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,341
Just listen for just a minute.

286
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,427
I saw my father get killed
when I was a kid.

287
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,889
It really messed up my head a lot.

288
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:14,353
- So you're okay now. Aren't you?
- You know that guy in my house?

289
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,774
He's my doctor. He came out
to help me from a mental hospital.

290
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,427
I.... Um, I saw it.

291
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,474
It's a big, pink elephant.

292
00:30:56,396 --> 00:31:02,401
You know, with my luck, you're probably
gonna turn out to be another delusion, heh.

293
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,501
Good morning, heh.

294
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,838
- Heh, well, what was that for?
- Nothing.

295
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,381
- Nothing?
- Mm-hm.

296
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,847
- Hello, Tina.
- Hi.

297
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,310
We've got tomatoes,
peppers, onions....

298
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,521
Sandra, don't do it that way.
It's gonna fall through the grill.

299
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,025
Okay, let's see what else.
Garlic, pepper....

300
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,152
Well, great.

301
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,865
Move it! Steve, come on.

302
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,534
Bye.

303
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:57,205
- Did you cut all the tomatoes?
- Yeah. They're all done.

304
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,500
It looks great.
What happened with you and Ben?

305
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,045
He blew me off to go out
with Eddie the other night.

306
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,589
- I can't believe he lied.
- What's wrong with Kate?

307
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,799
Just throw the ball.

308
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,847
Look at this.
It's made with latex.

309
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,184
- Have you seen Nick?
- He's around.

310
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,269
Dip?

311
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,691
She's like that with everybody
except boys. Come on.

312
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,944
Cocktail hour.

313
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:32,699
Ah, Robin, did you see the way
David just looked at me?

314
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,580
Oh, get real, Maddy.
You're not his type.

315
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,375
You need a little touchup work first.

316
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,627
Thanks.

317
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,588
The Colombian Express
is pulling out. All aboard.

318
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,590
Ding, ding, heh.

319
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:54,930
- Hey, Eddie, wanna do me a favor?
- Yeah, sure. Anything.

320
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,224
- I'm gonna do it.
- Robin, you don't smoke.

321
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,184
- I do now.
- No, you can't. Robin.

322
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,852
You and I made a deal.

323
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,438
We were gonna come here
and have a good time, right?

324
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:07,275
Well, I'm gonna stick to the deal.
You in?

325
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,444
Okay.

326
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,363
- Hi.
- Hi, David.

327
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,407
Come on.

328
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,867
So you wanna smoke with me?

329
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,160
- Yeah.
- Good.

330
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,788
So is Nick here or not?
I really wanna talk to him.

331
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,498
Don't worry, he'll show.

332
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:26,169
Hey, Tina, isn't this the way they wear
their jackets in the mental hospital?

333
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,466
What's she doing?

334
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,725
<i>- Ah.
-Wow.</i>

335
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,894
God, heh.

336
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,192
- What happened?
- Tina.

337
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,778
Hey, wait, Tina!

338
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,409
What's going on, you guys?

339
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,496
I hate this place.

340
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:05,834
He's making me do things that
I don't wanna do. I'm seeing things.

341
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,545
I could've killed somebody.
How could I have done that?

342
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,507
Because, Tina, when you're highly emotional,
you do almost anything, you see.

343
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,801
It just proves my point.

344
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,721
I mean, you made the matchbook
move, you broke the pearls.

345
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,098
If you can believe
that I did those things...

346
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,018
...then why can't you believe that
I saw someone get killed?

347
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,187
We do believe you, Tina.

348
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,607
Your psychokinesis and these delusions
are just all tied together.

349
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:32,569
No, you're not listening to me!
You haven't heard a single word I've said!

350
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,197
Can we go back now?
I don't wanna stay here anymore!

351
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,158
Go back where, Tina? Look at me!
Back to the hospital?

352
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,203
We're starting to make some real
progress because you are here.

353
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,621
- Please!
- We'll go back tomorrow.

354
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,498
- You can't leave.
- It's not working.

355
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,376
Do you wanna throw this all away?
We're at a very critical point right now!

356
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,213
Do you wanna see her in the hospital
for the rest of her life?

357
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,174
- Is that what you want?
- Look what you're doing to her!

358
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,567
- Hey. Whoa. Whoa. Where you going?
- Oh, Nick, I wanna get out of here.

359
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,821
- Melissa was a bitch.
- No, forget Melissa.

360
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,616
There's something really wrong here.
I know it, and no one else believes me.

361
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:24,412
- Tina, what are you talking about?
- Did your cousin ever show up?

362
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,958
- No, he didn't.
- Well, what did...?

363
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,417
What does he look like?

364
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,795
I don't see what this has to do
with anything.

365
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,298
Can you tell me what he looks like?
Do you have a picture or something?

366
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,426
Yeah, I do. I think I do.

367
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,930
It's right here.

368
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,808
Oh, God.

369
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,185
What?

370
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,937
I think he's dead, Nick.

371
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,775
Tina, pack your things,
we're gonna leave in the morning.

372
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,252
When did you first fall
in love with me?

373
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,550
The first time I saw the enormous
size of your beautiful...wallet.

374
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:22,304
Heh, there was this huge bulge in
your pants just calling out my name.

375
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:26,224
"Sandra, Sandra, take me now."

376
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,895
- You coming?
- What are you doing?

377
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,231
Come on. You chicken.

378
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,650
You're crazy.

379
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,154
Gonna go for a little swim?

380
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,910
Okay.

381
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,421
You need a formal invitation?

382
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,549
Russell, party for two,
right this way, please, heh.

383
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,195
No!

384
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,698
Russell, come on.

385
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,078
Russell! Russell!

386
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:59,442
King Tut rises from the tomb.

387
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,446
So we go to all this trouble
and no Michael. Typical.

388
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,740
- Know what I like about you?
- What?

389
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:09,077
You hardly sweat at all.

390
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,662
You wanna get high?

391
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:26,303
So, what do you wanna do?
Hit me?

392
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,182
Come on, Michael.
Come on, answer the phone.

393
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,643
I love you...

394
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,187
...squid-face.

395
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,392
Look, Michael has not shown up yet,
so I'm gonna go in the woods and look for him.

396
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,313
Hi, Nick. Are you still mad at me?

397
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,940
What was that crap you pulled
on Tina this afternoon?

398
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:26,529
That chick's crazy.
Besides, all is fair in love and war.

399
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:31,451
- Melissa, I don't even like you.
- Heh, "Like" has nothing to do with it.

400
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,538
<i>I know. Star Mummy.</i>

401
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,249
Excuse me. Hey.

402
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,629
We have got to get to know
each other better.

403
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,088
Are you joking?

404
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,174
Now, why would I do that?

405
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,885
You really think I'm cute?

406
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,346
Of course I do.

407
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,141
Since when?

408
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,935
I've always thought so.

409
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,647
You've just been too
blind to notice.

410
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,442
Dr. Crews?

411
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,188
<i>I told you,
I don't know how it happened.</i>

412
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:51,442
<i>The Anderson case
in '65. The documentation here is much greater.</i>

413
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,028
<i>By keeping Tina's trauma
and stress levels high...</i>

414
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:58,866
<i>...I am confident I can induce
huge psychokinetic reactions.</i>

415
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,536
What do you think you're doing?

416
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:06,040
You... You never intended to help her.

417
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,752
Be reasonable.
That's why I'm here.

418
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,423
First I find this spike and
then this.... This....

419
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:18,011
- What have you been doing to my daughter?
- I have been trying to help her.

420
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:23,391
What's this? ls this what Tina's talking about?
Have you been hiding this all this time?

421
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,769
I can't expect you to understand
this highly complicated process...

422
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:31,691
- ...that is integral to your daughter's treatment.
- Liar! I can see what you've been doing.

423
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,861
You have deliberately turned
my daughter into an emotional wreck.

424
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,571
That's not true.

425
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:41,576
Mrs. Shepard, what you saw was....
Was a side effect of her treatment.

426
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,997
Treatment?

427
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,752
You bastard.

428
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:55,715
You brought her here so that
you could watch her perform.

429
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,384
- It's out of your hands.
- How could you do this to her?

430
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:02,013
I don't care what you say,
I'm her doctor.

431
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,225
We'll put her in the hospital. We'll begin
psychotropic drug therapy right away.

432
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,812
Do you...? Do you really think
that I'd ever let you see her again?

433
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,898
Mrs. Shepard, she needs help.

434
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,692
She's dangerous to herself,
she's dangerous to all of us.

435
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,236
How can you say that?
She's not dangerous.

436
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,447
She killed her father.
Look what she's tried to do with me.

437
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,367
I see no other choice
but to get her into the hospital.

438
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,662
- No.
- Mrs. Shepard...

439
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:30,291
...I'm gonna have to commit her,
even if it is against your wishes.

440
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,510
Tina?

441
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,638
Tina, no!

442
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,994
Mom?

443
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,955
No!

444
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,886
"Need a little touchup work,"
my ass.

445
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,984
David?

446
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,366
David, are you out there?

447
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,203
David?

448
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,583
David?

449
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,572
Where are you?

450
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,327
David!

451
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,168
My earring.

452
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,982
Ah, thank God.

453
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,658
- Nick.
- Tina.

454
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,203
I just saw my mom.
I've gotta go find her.

455
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,793
What's that?

456
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,965
Tina? Tina!

457
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,384
Oh, my God!

458
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,803
- She's gone.
- Oh, no. No.

459
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,806
- What if she's hurt?
- We didn't pass her on the road.

460
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,559
Tina! Tina!

461
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,895
Wait, wait. Wait a minute!
Don't go! Don't leave!

462
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,448
Ouch.

463
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,782
- What?
- Your watch.

464
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,618
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God.

465
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,950
What's that?

466
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:23,537
- What?
- That.

467
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:29,043
- Oh, shit. I hope it isn't Michael.
- Oh, what timing.

468
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:33,172
- Quick, get a balloon.
- Yeah, right. Happy fucking birthday.

469
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,550
You're here at last, birthday boy.
Stop shaking the van.

470
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,886
- Let's surprise him, heh.
- Heh, right.

471
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,180
On the count of three. You ready?

472
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,558
- One, two, three.
- Ahem

473
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,061
- Go. Surprise!
- Surprise!

474
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:52,525
- Where is he?
- He's probably out there somewhere.

475
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,112
- Let's get him.
- I'm not going out there.

476
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,614
Come on, the motherfucker's
out there.

477
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,741
I'm gonna get him.

478
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,119
Make it fast.

479
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,496
Be right back.

480
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,710
All right, Michael.

481
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:12,920
Come on.

482
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,090
Where are you, buddy, huh?

483
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,347
Come on, Michael.

484
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,850
Where are you, buddy? Come on.

485
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:33,149
Ben, are you coming back or not?

486
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,126
Ben, where are you?

487
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,640
Ben!

488
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,101
Michael?

489
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,146
Hey, I'm talking to you.

490
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,524
Stop screwing around.

491
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,323
Eddie.

492
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,991
Eddie.

493
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,994
This just isn't gonna work out.

494
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,205
- What's the matter?
- I lied.

495
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,665
- Lied about what?
- About everything.

496
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,126
You just don't turn me on.
Really.

497
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:38,839
Look, come on,
at least I gave you a chance.

498
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,674
You just didn't come through.

499
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:46,013
Anyway, I was kind of hoping Nick
would come back and find you with me.

500
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:51,101
- Why'd you lie?
- You know. Make him jealous.

501
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,313
Rejection.

502
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,983
Okay. Fine. I can take it.

503
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,986
I've been rejected by
some of the finest...

504
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:05,074
...science-fiction magazines
in the continental United States.

505
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,953
Eddie, where are you going?

506
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:14,166
To take a cold shower.
I got a date with a soap on a rope.

507
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,992
What happened to the lights?

508
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,327
Who cares?

509
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,915
Come here.

510
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,302
Michael?

511
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,475
Michael.

512
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,358
I knew it.

513
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,445
I saw it.

514
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:33,078
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry. But we've gotta
keep going, we've gotta get out of here.

515
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,927
- I'm hungry.
- How romantic.

516
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,014
I'm really stoned.

517
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:57,394
The Neanderthal man,
hunter-gatherer, seeks nourishment.

518
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,862
Ooh.

519
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,493
It's dark.

520
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,640
- Here.
- Gee, thanks.

521
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,185
- Bye.
- Bye.

522
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:02,292
What the fuck?

523
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,490
Maddy?

524
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,338
What are you looking for?

525
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:51,341
My father's pistol. I know that
he has one in here somewhere.

526
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,807
Crews knew.

527
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:21,288
- What'd you find?
- I don't know.

528
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:26,126
Come on, Tina,
let's go get the others now.

529
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,836
Oh, this is important.

530
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,883
Jason Voorhees.

531
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:39,223
It was him in the lake.

532
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,558
What are you talking about?

533
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,529
Oh, my God, that's you.

534
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,716
"Happy birthday, Michael.
You lucky son of a bitch.

535
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,762
Many happy returns.
Love, Melissa."

536
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,764
Cunt.

537
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,795
"Personal penis enlarger."

538
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,981
You all right? You sure?

539
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,984
Listen. If this Jason guy
is really out there, Tina...

540
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:18,155
...I wanna get everybody together
so we can get the hell out of here.

541
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,992
- What, Tina? What is it?
- She's in the woods, Nick.

542
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,287
- Who?
- My mother. I know that's where she is.

543
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,998
All right. We'll find her, Tina.

544
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:31,460
We'll find her, but let's get everybody
so we can leave together.

545
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,057
So change your mind or what?

546
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,808
Melissa?

547
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,126
Maddy?

548
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,601
David?

549
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,396
David?

550
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,782
Are you in here?

551
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,153
David?

552
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,204
David, are you in there?

553
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,065
Just a cat.

554
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,067
Kitty.

555
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,198
Come here, kitty.

556
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,828
Whose kitty are you, huh?

557
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,455
Are you David's kitty?

558
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,043
No, David doesn't have a kitty.

559
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,883
You're cute. Yes, you are. What?

560
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:14,558
You scared, kitty?
Don't be scared.

561
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,019
Where are you going, hmm?

562
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,165
No!

563
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,804
- Tina.
- I've gotta go find her.

564
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,723
Can we get everybody
together first?

565
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,351
I can't go with you. What if she
comes back and I'm not here?

566
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:03,940
- I don't wanna leave you alone.
- Well, then, you go. You go.

567
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,443
And I'll stay right here.

568
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:10,071
- Just hurry back.
- Don't move.

569
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:30,842
David?

570
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,387
Maddy?

571
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,192
Tina?

572
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,777
- Tina!
- Mrs. Shepard.

573
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,946
- Answer me! Where are you?
- Look at me.

574
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,615
You're wasting time.
She's probably back at the house.

575
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,784
- Do you know that?
- You saw the car. Tina!

576
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,661
Let's call the police, all right?

577
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,288
- Why? Damn it, she's out here!
- We are wasting time.

578
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,333
Don't you understand that,
Mrs. Shepard?

579
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,543
- What's the matter with you?
- Wait, wait.

580
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,673
Nothing.

581
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,842
- What is it? What aren't you telling me?
- I'm gonna leave.

582
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,636
You can find your own way back.

583
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:19,474
You're not just a lousy doctor,
you're a fucking coward!

584
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,643
Give me that key.

585
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:56,052
Listen to me. Tina knew.
She tried to tell us. She did.

586
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,555
- What? What are you doing?
- Oh, my God!

587
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,890
No! No!

588
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,983
Maddy?

589
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,736
Melissa? Anybody?

590
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,947
Tina?

591
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:00,784
Tina!

592
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,302
Jesus Christ.

593
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:23,264
- Where's Tina?
- A psych ward. How should I know?

594
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,266
- Eddie's dead.
- What?

595
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,686
He's dead. Michael's dead too.
I saw him.

596
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:32,649
- Get real.
- Just don't go over there, Melissa.

597
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,819
Okay.

598
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:57,757
Tina. Tina! Shh. Shh. You have to come back
with me now, please.

599
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,176
What are you doing here?
Where's my mother?

600
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:03,513
She's, um.... She's back at the house.
Come on, please.

601
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,265
- You're lying!
- I am not lying!

602
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:07,600
- You're lying, I was just there!
- Tina, please.

603
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:10,311
When I tell you to come back,
I mean it! Come--

604
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,814
Blood?

605
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:18,027
What happened? What did you do?

606
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,615
You've gotta help me.
We've gotta get out of here.

607
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:25,535
Where is she? Where's my mother?

608
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,704
- She's gone.
- What?

609
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,831
She's gone.

610
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,709
- Tina. Tina!
- Mother!

611
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,795
Tina, don't go in there! Tina!

612
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,781
Mom?

613
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,616
Mom!

614
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,119
Mama! Oh, God!

615
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:57,562
Kate, is that you?

616
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,606
Kate?

617
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:02,483
Kate?

618
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,057
Jason?

619
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,627
What the hell?

620
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:53,214
Tina?

621
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:58,094
- Tina.
- My mom.

622
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,596
He got my mom.

623
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:02,765
Who?

624
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:05,101
I killed him.

625
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,062
Jason's dead.

626
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:11,232
Okay, okay, shh, shh.

627
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,109
All right.

628
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:24,537
- You are nuts.
- Shut up, Melissa.

629
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,789
I don't believe you.

630
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:30,251
You people give me the creeps.

631
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,461
Hey, where do you think you're going?

632
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:35,464
I'm going back to bed.
You wanna come?

633
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:43,139
- Look, Melissa, just stay here with us.
- It's not my style.

634
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,851
- Don't go out there!
- Fuck you.

635
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:50,146
No. No, fuck you both!

636
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,165
Careful.

637
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,878
- Go!
- Ahh!

638
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:16,422
Shit!

639
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,759
- Run!
- Ahh!

640
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:31,854
Shit! Ugh!

641
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,523
Tina, come and--

642
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,235
Tina, what are you doing?

643
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,594
Come on.

644
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:34,250
No!

645
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,588
Nick?

646
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:50,029
Tina, come on! Go!

647
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,797
Run! Hit the deck!

648
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:10,507
Go!

649
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:29,526
Are you okay?

650
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,072
Are you okay?

651
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:36,325
It's all gone.

652
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:41,246
Everything's gone.

653
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,292
Shh.

654
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:51,632
It's okay.

655
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:58,806
Let's get out of here.

656
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,021
No! Tina!

657
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,492
Daddy?

658
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:07,207
- Right there.
- Over here.

659
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:17,384
Pretty much got her under control,
but, uh, we may need some backup.

660
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:19,261
Help me with this,
will you, Charlie?

661
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:22,306
I need.... I need about four guys over here.
That should do it.

662
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,600
How's she doing?

663
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:28,771
Nick? Nick?

664
01:24:28,938 --> 01:24:30,272
He's all right.

665
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,608
I just found another one.

666
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,112
A little more hose, please.

667
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,370
I got it, I got it.

668
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:55,005
- Jason. Where's Jason?
- We took care of him.

669
01:24:56,305 --> 01:25:56,664
