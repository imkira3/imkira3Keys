See you later!

4
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:26,945
Come on, guys.
Leave him alone.

5
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:37,988
<i>Hello?</i>

6
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,753
Boy.

7
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:15,256
Wow. That was amazing.

8
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:17,595
Why don't you play outside
with your friends?

9
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:20,430
I don't know.

10
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,671
Come here.

11
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:29,939
You don't know, huh?

12
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,674
Sometimes they make fun of me.

13
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,177
Hmm.

14
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:38,180
Is that real?

15
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,280
Yes.

16
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:42,385
It's real.
Everything here is real.

17
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:44,920
Whoa. Is that real?

18
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,024
That cat is real.

19
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,559
Real monster.

20
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,771
What's that?

21
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:01,704
This?

22
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,508
This is Lloyd.

23
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,713
Hmm.

24
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:14,416
He looks like
a very brave fighter.

25
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:16,851
No, he's just a kid.

26
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,921
He can't do anything.

27
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:22,027
He might look different, but...

28
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:26,998
But he can do great things.

29
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,034
Whoa.

30
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,303
You just have to look at it,

31
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:36,874
from a different
point of view.

32
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,119
Whoa!

33
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,022
This is his teacher.

34
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,492
Very old,

35
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:56,357
very wise

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,894
and very handsome.

37
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:06,067
Have you ever heard the legend
behind the legend of NINJAGO?

38
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,435
No.

39
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,704
I will tell you.

40
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:12,240
But to truly see it,
you must forget

41
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,277
everything you know.

42
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,949
And see things in a new way.

43
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,852
The story of NINJAGO

44
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:27,389
is the story of a boy.

45
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:29,290
His name is Lloyd.

46
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:34,032
And his dad is the worst guy
in the history of the world.

47
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:39,067
<i>Today on</i>
Good Morning NINJAGO...

48
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,335
<i>Buenos días,</i> NINJAGO!

49
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,839
G'day, NINJAGO!

50
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:43,839
<i>Guten Morgen,</i>
NINJAGO.

51
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,009
<i>Bonjour,</i> NINJAGO.

52
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:47,609
<i>When Garmadon attacks...</i>

53
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,678
<i>...we are there!</i>

54
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:53,516
<i>When Garmadon crashes
the stock market,</i>

55
00:03:53,518 --> 00:03:54,883
<i>we're there again!</i>

56
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:57,653
<i>When Garmadon defaces</i>
Whistler's Mother,

57
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,056
<i>we're still there!</i>

58
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,923
<i>We are the only news team</i>

59
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,726
<i>watching Garmadon's
volcanic lair</i>

60
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,326
<i>24 hours a day.</i>

61
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,898
- <i>This is...</i>
- Good Morning, NINJAGO!

62
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,867
- I'm Robin Roberts.
- And I'm Michael Strahan.

63
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:14,869
And I am pumped
to be bringing you the news.

64
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:16,738
<i>- Pumped!</i>
- Whoo!

65
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,809
Well, looks like everyone
is on pins and needles

66
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,910
waiting for
Garmadon's next attack.

67
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:23,710
<i>Attack forecast!</i>

68
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:25,114
Our experts predict

69
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:28,850
a 95% chance
of a Garmadon attack today.

70
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,419
Yikes! NINJAGO,
you better stay inside.

71
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,823
You better stay right there.
Don't you dare come out!

72
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:36,792
<i>At least until our
Secret Ninja Force steps in.</i>

73
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,427
Thank goodness
for those Ninjas.

74
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,628
<i>But who are these
Secret Ninjas, Robin?</i>

75
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,996
<i>We have
so many questions.</i>

76
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,068
<i>Burning questions!</i>

77
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,335
<i>Fire Ninja.</i>

78
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:48,938
<i>Where is he on a scale of
one to awesome?</i>

79
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,306
I'm not gonna lie.

80
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:52,574
I'm awesome!

81
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:53,843
<i>Earth Ninja.</i>

82
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:55,778
<i>When will he upgrade
to digital?</i>

83
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,015
No, I would never do that.

84
00:04:58,515 --> 00:04:59,647
<i>Ice Ninja.</i>

85
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,218
<i>Is he a real boy or a robot?</i>

86
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,987
<i>How dare you. I'm a wild teen.</i>

87
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:06,222
<i>Lightning Ninja.</i>

88
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,556
<i>Is he the bravest ninja
of them all?</i>

89
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:12,160
<i>I'll take that as a yes.</i>

90
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:13,595
<i>Water Ninja.</i>

91
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,097
<i>She's a girl and a ninja!
Can she really have it all?</i>

92
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:19,802
You fellas
need to inform yourselves

93
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:21,235
of where we're at culturally.

94
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,008
<i>And finally the Green Ninja.</i>

95
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,641
<i>He fights in the air,</i>

96
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:28,009
<i>on the ground,</i>

97
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,778
<i>and in the kitchen
with a refrigerator.</i>

98
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,814
<i>But what is he hiding?</i>

99
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,616
<i>And who is he really?</i>

100
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,018
<i>Local birthdays!</i>

101

00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,422
and, uh-oh...

104
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,224
<i>Lloyd Garmadon.</i>

105
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:45,794
The son of
the evil Lord Garmadon.

106
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,102
<i>Must be tough
to be that kid.</i>

107
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,746
Hello?

108
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:08,953
<i>Hello.</i>

109
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,254
<i>What do you want?</i>

110
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,356
- Uh... You called me.
- <i>Hang on a second.</i>

111
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,460
<i>Mm. I must have
butt dialed you. Who is this?</i>

112
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,063
It's Lloyd.

113
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:24,232
- Lloyd Garmadon, your son.
- <i>No.</i>

114
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:27,169
<i>My son is totally bald
and has no teeth.</i>

115
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,239
Yeah, well, surprise.
I'm not a baby anymore.

116
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:31,371
<i>Duly noted.</i>

117
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:32,874
<i>How old are you?
You're seven, right?</i>

118
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,676
- <i>You're seven? Huh.</i>
- Sixteen.

119
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:36,078
Just add nine to that.

120
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,277
- <i>Well, good talk, son.</i>
- Wait.

121
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,847
Are you sure there isn't
a special reason

122
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,218
why you might have
called me today?

123
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,085
On this day.

124
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,420
Specifically today.

125
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:48,891
<i>Look, I didn't call you.
My butt called you.</i>

126
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,558
Oh.

127
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,494
<i>Well, no time to chat. Sorry,
Daddy's got to go to work.</i>

128
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,196
- <i>Gotta get that Green Ninja.</i>
- Yeah.

129
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:56,232
<i>Glad the teeth
finally came in. Bye-bye.</i>

130
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,136
Lloyd! Good morning!

131
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:05,006
Mom, hey,
um, here's a thought.

132
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,977
What if I didn't go
to school today?

133
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,278
What? Oh, no!

134
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,879
You don't want to
miss school, honey.

135
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,513
These are the best years
of your life.

136
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,984
Um, have you...
Have you been to high school?

137
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,619
'Cause, uh...

138
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:19,821
It's judgey. Pretty judgey.

139
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,422
Oh, honey.

140
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:23,492
You just need to give them
a chance to see the real you.

141
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:24,794
Yeah, I don't think

142
00:07:24,796 --> 00:07:28,229
I can actually show people
the real me.

143
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,330
That's not true.

144
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,866
All you've got to do
is just show them

145
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,402
the person you are
on the inside.

146
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:34,636
Right here.

147
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,571
Where it matters most.

148
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:37,972
Oh, and also don't forget,

149
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:39,809
if your dad attacks
the city again today,

150
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:41,210
just be sure to...

151
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,477
Duck and cover
until the Secret Ninjas

152
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,545
give the all clear.

153
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,247
- Oh, and also, don't forget,
- LLOYD: Yeah?

154
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:48,451
Have a happy birthday, honey.

155
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:49,652
Thanks, Mom.

156
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:50,852
I'll try my best.

157
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:52,253
Of course you will!

158
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,657
Hello!

159
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,302
Shh.

160
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,276
Hey.

161
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,316
Cool.

162
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,640
Shh.

163
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:50,544
That's the kid
I was telling you about.

164
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:52,316
His dad ruins everything.

165
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,617
Hello, fellow teenager!

166
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,151
Zane, hey!

167
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:00,088
Man, my mom is on my case
all the time. She's all...

168
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,428
And I'm like, "Lay off, Mom.
I'm just a teenager."

169
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,463
I hear that.

170
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,531
Bro!

171
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,899
Dude, gimme a hug, man!

172
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,900
- Gimme a birthday hug.
- Kai.

173
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:14,769
- That's a good one.
- Birthday hug?

174
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,103
Let me get in on that.

175
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:18,006
I'll increase
the pressure dramatically.

176
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:19,328
Zane, Zane, Zane...

177
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:22,044

180
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:27,116
Oh, hey, actual bro.

181
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:29,083
Hey, Nya!
Where'd you get that bike?

182
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:32,253
At the great
stuff store? Uh...

183
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:34,924

<i>Hey, everyone, look!</i>

188

L-L-O-Y-D.
His dad is bad and so is he.

191
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,905
Boo, Lloyd!

192
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:52,005
Boo, Lloyd!

193
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,575
Boo, Lloyd!

194
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:54,843
Great chant!

195
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,545
I'll bet you got a number one
hit on your hands.

196

<i>And straight in

Say it again!

212
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,635
Garmadon!

213
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:55,136
I can't hear you!

214
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:56,905
- Garmadon!
- Garmadon!

215
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,274
<i>Don't wear it out!</i>

<i>Okay, General Number Six.</i>

00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:00,675
Yes, sir.

- I can do that.

220
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,281
General Number One,

221
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:09,049
- <i>take the TV station.</i>
- 10-4!

222
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:10,251

225
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:14,522

<i>I've never seen that before!</i>

232

We're gonna die!

233
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:31,939
Now,
all I have to do is climb

234
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,242
<i>to the top of NINJAGO Tower,</i>

235

<i>and then I will rule

236
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:36,544
Wait. What?

237
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:40,750
I said I will rule
over NINJAGO, forever!

238
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,651
Where are the ninjas?

239
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,391
- MS.
- Uh-oh.

240

Thanks, Lloyd.

You know what
to do. Duck and cover!

243
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:55,996
Can I have
a bathroom pass?

244
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,266
I think you mean, "May I."

245
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:01,337
"May I have a bathroom pass?"

246
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,739
You know what?
Do whatever you want.

247
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:04,972
Come on, come on!

00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:23,838
Oh, no!

331
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,444
N-I-N-J-A!

332
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:33,247
N-I-N-J-A! Ninjas!

333
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:36,919
Thank you, Green Ninja!

334
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,553
You're our hero!

335
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:40,321
I wanna be him
when I grow up!

336
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:42,891
Hey, Lloyd, your dad...
I mean, uh...

337
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:45,126
Garmadon's almost
at the mayor's office!

338
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:46,761
I'm on it.

339
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,265
We've got you surrounded,
Garmadon.

340
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,165
<i>You're too slow, Green Ninja.</i>

341
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,300
<i>You can't catch me.</i>

342
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,904
<i>Where am I?
Am I over here?</i>

343
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:56,938
<i>Or am I over there?</i>

344
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,006
You are right behind
that building.

345
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:00,842
<i>I can see your shark tail
sticking out.</i>

346
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,976
<i>Oh, let me grab that.</i>

347
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:04,313
<i>Where's Garmadon now?</i>

348
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:05,746
Am I over here, here, here?

349
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:07,315
Or am I over there,
there, there, there?

350
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:08,916
It's like a house of mirrors
in here.

351
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:10,584
Do you think
you're hiding right now?

352
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,286
Do you actually think
I can't see you?

353
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,588
<i>Well, if you can see me,
why don't you shoot me?</i>

354
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,558
<i>Ow! That was, like,
in my kidney!</i>

355
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,862
Why do you want to conquer
NINJAGO so badly?

356
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:24,301
Because there's something
very, very special here.

357
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:26,068
What?

358
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,366
I'm gonna let the walls down

359
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:29,036
for just a second,
Green Ninja.

360
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,270
Go... Go on.

361
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,073
About 16 years ago,

362
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,675
I lost something
I should have never given up.

363
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:36,243
What is it? Just say it.

364
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,312
It's okay, you can say it.

365
00:16:37,314 --> 00:16:39,013
I had this guitar in college,

366
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:42,049
and I traded it stupidly for,
like, a jacket or something.

367
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,649
That's what you were
referring to?

368
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:44,919
Yeah. What else would I be
referring to?

369
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,054
I don't know.
Maybe something else.

370
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,289
- Think about it.
- What? No!

371
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,958
Are you sure
there's not any other

372
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,361
sort of connection
you have to the city?

373
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:53,694
- Nothing?
- There is someone

374
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,429
in the city I love very much.

375
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,799
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

376
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,700
I remember when I first
laid eyes on him.

377
00:16:58,702 --> 00:16:59,867
Go on.

378
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:02,270
The last time
I saw him was, uh,

379
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,139
I guess about
16 years ago, too.

380
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:05,439
Yeah?

381
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,443
I was just
an irresponsible kid and...

382
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,877
Uh-huh.

383
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,378
There was this

384
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,312
guy who made,
probably, the best sushi

385
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,616
I've ever had in my life.

386
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,149
You never knew
what was coming next.

387
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:17,416
And you didn't even order.
It was one of those places

388
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:18,286
where you don't
even get a menu.

389
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,354
Omakase.

390
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:20,821
Is that the name of the place?

391
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,124
No, that just means
he brings it to you...

392
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:23,724
That is!
That's the name of the place.

393
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:24,858
...and you don't
choose, he chooses.

394
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,726
- That's the place.
- Omakase.

395
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:27,327
Anyway, just to clarify,

396
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,629
nothing, nothing else, if you
really racked your brain,

397
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,432
there's no other connection?

398
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:33,267
Yes. There was a boy

399
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,569
that I had in my life.

400
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:36,805
What happened to your child?

401
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,339
He was bald, had no teeth,
couldn't chew,

402
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:41,108
always crying, couldn't walk.

403
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,609
Couldn't even walk.
I mean, I was like,

404
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,045
"What are we gonna do
with this kid?"

405
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm like, "I don't want
a hairless, crying son

406
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:47,415
"for the rest of my life."

407
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,883
- Zip it! Zip! No!
- And that was when

408
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:50,418
I made the decision
to go away and live my life.

409
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,053
Stop talking!
You're done!

410
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:54,122
<i>Mega missile
mode. Right claw missile.</i>

411
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:55,222
<i>Left claw missile.</i>

412
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,290
<i>Feet bombs.</i>

413
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:57,892
<i>Tongue rocket. Spine missile</i>

414
00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:59,126
<i>one, two, three, four.
Tail rocket, one, two...</i>

415
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:00,796
<i>Eye missile.
Other eye missile.</i>

416
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:02,463
<i>Toenail missile. Wrist rocket.</i>

417
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:03,697
<i>Head missile.
Other head missile.</i>

418
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:05,032
<i>Backup head missile.</i>

419
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:06,100
<i>Metacarpal missile.</i>

420
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:07,737
<i>Butt torpedoes.</i>

421
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:22,517
Oh. Phew.
Just one day till retirement.

422
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,630
Jeez, where did
that come from?

423
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:37,632
I did not see that coming.

424
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:40,134
Your missiles are very
accurate, Green Ninja.

425
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:43,937
Too bad for you,
I upgraded all of my shields!

426
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,374
That's all I seem to have
at the moment,

427
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:46,473
just some upgraded shields.

428
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:47,842
<i>Face it, Garmadon.</i>

429
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:50,243
You will never
take over NINJAGO,

430
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:53,181
so why don't you just give up
and go away for good?

431
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:55,450
Well, anything's open
for discussion.

432
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:57,385
Oh, yeah, except that.

433
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,485
Shields down!

434
00:18:58,487 --> 00:18:59,722
Here, catch! Shields up!

435
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,893
No!

436
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,761
Did you see that?

437
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,263
Oh, yeah, we saw it.

438
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:11,199
I mean, who taught
you how to catch, man?

439
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:13,835
Nice catch, loser!

440
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:16,003
Oh, yeah? Well, take this!

441
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:22,644
That's amazing!
Who taught you how to throw?

442
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:23,712
It's funny you ask.

443
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:25,312
Um, no one, because I, uh...

444
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:27,482
I never had a dad
to play catch with me.

445
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:28,683
Well, it shows.

446
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:29,715
'Cause that was
the worst thing

447
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:31,152
I've ever seen in my life.

448
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:33,020
Or, uh, you know,
teach me how to ride a bike,

449
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,155
or shave...

450
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,157
Or how to defuse a bomb!

451
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,259
You know what's funny?

452
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,194
Is I know how to do
all those things.

453
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:41,261
- Do you?
- Yeah.

454
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,597
Oh, good to know.

455
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,832
And they're just sitting
there, idle in my brain.

456
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,768
Just wasted. Floating away.

457
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,936
- Never taught them to anybody.
- Mm-hmm.

458
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,538
And they'll
probably die with me.

459
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,839
Really?

460
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,441
When I die, if I die.

461
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,108
- Just leave NINJAGO already...
- Which will never happen.

462
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,611
- ...please!
- I will never die.

463
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,414
- And get out of my life!
- Ever. Ever.

464
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,681
I...

465
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:03,117
Get out of your life?

466
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,186
Weirdly kinda personal,
isn't it?

467
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:07,557
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, man.

468
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,590
Um...

469
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:11,125
No.

470
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,294
You've got a lot of issues,
Green Ninja.

471
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,596
I hope you get the chance to

472
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,297
work 'em all out
by the time I'm back.

473
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,799
And when I return,

474
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,434
I'll have something really
wicked in store for you.

475
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,069
Something big!

476
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:24,105
Uh, did he just say
he's coming back?

477
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:26,508
Can't those Ninjas
get rid of him for good?

478
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,110
Oh, great. Now I have to
rebuild my Pilates studio.

479
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:31,212
That stinks.

480
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:32,981
I don't know how,
but I bet Lloyd Garmadon

481
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,148
has something to do with this.

482
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,414
You can sure
say that again.

483
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,217
I don't know how...

484
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,253
Is that Green Ninja
still staring at me?

485
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,922
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

486
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,926
Ugh. What a weirdo.

487
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,905
<i>Volcano base,
this is Alpha Squad.</i>

488
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,575
<i>Arriving shortly at LZ.</i>

489
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:01,974
<i>Bakery team,</i>

490
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:03,377
<i>the victory cake
goes back in the fridge.</i>

491
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:06,012
<i>The victory cake
goes back in the fridge.</i>

492
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,549
<i>There is
a magma spill on Deck Three.</i>

493
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:11,789
<i>Avoid Deck Three
if sensitive to magma.</i>

494
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:16,722
<i>Just passed
Garmadon in the hallway,</i>

495
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:17,991
<i>he seems pretty angry.</i>

496
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,461
<i>He's requesting</i>

497
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:22,296
<i>a mandatory staff meeting
by the fireplace.</i>

498
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:23,764
<i>Is that
the room with the lava</i>

499
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:25,265
<i>or the room
where people get fired?</i>

500
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:26,633
<i>It's both.</i>

501
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:42,584
Well, generals,

502
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:44,752
congratulations.

503
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:47,190
We finally conquered NINJAGO.

504
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:51,925
I'm not certain we did that.

505
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:53,962
- I was being sarcastic!
- Whoa!

506
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:56,263
Every time I try
and conquer NINJAGO,

507
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:58,867
that meddling Green Ninja
thwarts me.

508
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:00,202
I mean,
who are these super ninjas?

509
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:01,802
Every time I come up
with a new plan,

510
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:03,104
they still beat me!

511
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,872
And they don't even have
cool suits!

512
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:06,039
You guys have, like,

513
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,041
crab outfits
and shark outfits.

514
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:10,944
I mean, maybe we're spending
too much on outfits.

515
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:13,280
That sounds right to me, sir.

516
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:14,449
Oh, come on!

517
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:16,183
Look, you guys gotta
think for yourselves.

518
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,252
I'm not your father,
all right?

519
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,020
Is that a weird
thing for him to say to us?

520
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,622
<i>General Number One,</i>

521
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:23,824
do you wanna be a follower,
or do you wanna be a leader?

522
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:26,360
Uh... A leader?

523
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:28,363
How dare you.

524
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:30,365
I mean, follower!

525
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,531
You! What's your title?

526
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:33,100
Uh, I'm General
Number Two, sir.

527
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,702
Well, now,
you're General Number One.

528
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:36,471
- Oh.
- And you, what's your title?

529
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:37,739
General Three?

530
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:38,971
Well, now you're
General Number Two.

531
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:39,874
You see
where I'm going with this?

532
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:40,774
No.

533
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,077
I told the Green Ninja

534
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,511
I was coming back
with something big,

535
00:22:43,513 --> 00:22:46,547
something wicked,
something with some pizzazz.

536
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:48,148
General Number One,

537
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,017
go ahead. Give me some ideas.

538
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,552
Well, sir,
I was thinking maybe

539
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:53,454
we could work
on the morale of the troops.

540
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,455
They're always scared of being
fired!

541
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:01,695
We could do the
same thing we did last time?

542
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:03,063
Whoa!

543
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,700
What if we dress up
as the Secret Ninjas?

544
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:06,334
It's time we develop
a code language.

545
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:08,868
Intimidation. We paint angry
eyebrows on the troops' faces.

546
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,672
What if you just ran
for mayor?

547
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:13,308
Whoa! Whoa!

548
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,177
Oh, come on. How hard is it
to come up with a genius idea?

549
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:18,713
<i>Anyone? Come on,
jump ball.</i>

550
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:20,482
<i>This is a safe place.</i>

551
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:21,982
Go ahead. Just grab it.

552
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,484
- Excuse me, Lord...
- Nerd! You're interrupting.

553
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,855
Sorry, sir. We just cooked
this up in engineering.

554
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:29,460
Give me that!

555
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,495
Garma-daddy likey!

556
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:38,932
<i>- Lloyd...
- Yeah?</i>

557
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,135
<i>That's your dad.
You were open, man.</i>

558
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:43,805
<i>It was highly poignant.</i>

559
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:45,206
<i>For me,
it's easy to fight him</i>

560
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,974
<i>'cause he's, like,
not my father.</i>

561
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:49,041
<i>But for you,
that must be so complicated.</i>

562
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:50,611
<i>Not that complicated.</i>

563
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:53,713
<i>You also really pulled
at my heartstrings, man.</i>

564
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:55,781
I felt for you.

565
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,085
With... With the missiles.

566
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:58,854
No. With the other...
The other stuff.

567
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,686
The dad stuff.

568
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:03,657
Yeah, but, like, exactly what
are you referring to?

569
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,092
- Watching you and your father.
- The vulnerability.

570
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:07,426
You got so emotional.

571
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:10,130
Emotions were the last thing

572
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:12,767
that was going on out there.

573
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:14,969
- Um, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,971
It's okay, Lloyd.
Nobody's parents are perfect.

575
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:21,009
I mean, my mom is weird
and collects seashells.

576
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:24,412
Your dad levels cities
and attacks innocent people.

577
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:27,047
So, they've all got
their quirks, you know?

578
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:30,885
Uh, where's that
tranquil music coming from?

579
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:34,122
<i>Hey, look, everyone!
Master Wu is back.</i>

580
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,290
- Hello, students.
- Master Wu!

581
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:38,125
- <i>Shock.</i>
- How was your trip?

582
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:40,427
It was a deep
spiritual journey

583
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,963
that took me to depths
inside myself

584
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:44,298
I never knew existed.

585
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,834
Yeah. You have
a pretty serious tan line.

586
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:48,168
Don't judge me.

587
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,338
So, did you see us kick
Garmadon's butt?

588
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,106
- We vanquished him.
- Ba-ba bam!

589
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:55,777
I saw you fight
and I saw Garmadon retreat.

590
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,811
But you did not defeat him.

591
00:24:57,813 --> 00:24:59,213
What?

592
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,149
There's nothing ninja
about you ninjas.

593
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:03,885
We're so ninja. I don't know
what you're talking about.

594
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:06,752
You will never
truly defeat Garmadon

595
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,288
until you see things

596
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,492
from a different
point of view.

597
00:25:10,494 --> 00:25:13,793
You have the power to win
the battle without fighting.

598
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:15,829
When you start using
your mind,

599
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:18,232
you won't need mechs
and machines.

600
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,902
Your call signs
are not just cool names.

601
00:25:20,904 --> 00:25:24,905
They are the elemental powers
you were all born with.

602
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:28,609
Nya, you can create water
on your own.

603
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:32,146
- And Kai, fire!
- Wow!

604
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:33,948
Jay, lightning.

605
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,082
So ninja.

606
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:37,484
- Cole, earth.
- Whoa!

607
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:38,618
We both spin.

608
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,320
And Zane, ice.

609
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:41,489
Ice is nice.

610
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:44,792
These elemental powers
are why I chose you

611
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,593
to form
the Secret Ninja Force.

612
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:50,264
It is the highest level that
you can achieve as a ninja.

613
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:54,201
I wrote a book about it.
It's called <i>Ninjanuity.</i>

614
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:55,569
Copyright, Master Wu.

615
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:58,505
And what about me?
What am I?

616
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:02,108
Lloyd, yours is the most
important element of all.

617
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,810
Okay. Hit me with it.

618
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,682
Your elemental power is green.

619
00:26:07,684 --> 00:26:09,616
- What's that?
- Green.

620
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:12,052
Okay, so, uh, just to recap.

621
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:14,888
Fire. Ice. Water. Earth.

622
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,723
Lightning. And...

623
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:17,991
Green.

624
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,194
Don't think
it's an element though.

625
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:20,694
- Lloyd...
- Can I be gold?

626
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:21,994
- No.
- Wind isn't taken.

627
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:23,063
Can I be wind?

628
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:24,531
- No.
- Earth, green, and fire.

629
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:25,999
- Rolls right off the tongue.
- Lloyd...

630
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:29,236
Could I be
the element of surprise?

631
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:31,572
No. That's the Fuchsia Ninja.

632
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:33,006
Surprise.

633
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,741
There are
so many elements left.

634
00:26:34,744 --> 00:26:37,677
This feels kinda purposeful
that I don't have one.

635
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,682
Enough, Lloyd.
Come with me for mentor talk.

636
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,251
The rest of you,
practice Spinjitzu.

637
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:45,117
That's easy. Watch this.

638
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,754
Exertion.

639
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:48,422
For three hours.

640
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,059
Three hours! Are you kidding
me with this guy!

641
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:52,425
And read my book!

642
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:55,032
Oh, man!

643
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,401
Master Wu,
you don't understand.

644
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:04,739
Right now, on that volcano...

645
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:07,907
<i>Garmadon is making something
really big.</i>

646
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,743
<i>He's building something huge.</i>

647
00:27:09,745 --> 00:27:13,347
<i>And something
surely shark themed.</i>

648
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:18,989
<i>And he's gonna come back
sooner rather than later.</i>

649
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:21,355
So, what do I do?

650
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:25,325
Nephew, weapons alone
will not solve your problem.

651
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,828
I have every kind of weapon
in my dojo.

652
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,231
Big weapons, little weapons,
sharp weapons, dull weapons,

653
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,899
even the Ultimate Weapon.

654
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,434
But the strongest weapon
is inside you.

655
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,637
Wait. I'm sorry,
what did you just say?

656
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:39,405
The strongest weapon
is inside you.

657
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,642
No, no, no. Before that.
The thing right before that.

658
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:43,076
What? You mean...

659
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,048
<i>The Ultimate Weapon!</i>

660
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:53,654
And you've been
hiding this why?

661
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:54,955
In the wrong hands,

662
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:58,393
the Ultimate Weapon
could spell doom for NINJAGO.

663
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:00,761
Put that in my hands.

664
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,930
Why does it matter
how we beat Garmadon

665
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,232
as long as we beat him?

666
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:06,500
Because, nephew, right now,

667
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:10,139
your hands
are the wrong hands.

668
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:18,078
Lloyd,

669
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,680
I'm his brother.

670
00:28:19,682 --> 00:28:23,550
I, too, feel responsible
for the safety of NINJAGO.

671
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:26,019
But I will not always
be here to train you.

672
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:27,887
- Why?
- Because,

673
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:32,092
I'm super, super old.

674
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:33,626
Oh.

675
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,396
That's why I need you to
lead the Secret Ninja Force.

676
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,867
But you must promise
to walk a different path.

677
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:45,472
One that only
the son of Garmadon can walk.

678
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,145
No matter how hard it may be.

679
00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:53,213
Honestly, I would
happily give up

680
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:55,081
being a Secret Ninja

681
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:59,252
if it meant I didn't have to
be the son of Garmadon.

682
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:01,821
I know you've had
a hard life, Lloyd,

683
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,457
filled with many knocks.

684
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:05,292
Why don't I play you a song?

685
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:07,426
Perhaps it will speak to you.

686
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,578
Thanks, Uncle Wu.

687
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:43,464
No, no.
I don't know where he is.

688
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:45,668
No, he hasn't come home
from school.

689
00:29:47,837 --> 00:29:50,504
No, he did not join forces
with his father.

690
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:53,109
That is ridiculous.
Like your husband's a saint.

691
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,914
I am trying
not to freak out right now,

692
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:01,482
but I have called 18 people

693
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:03,451
and I cannot locate my son.

694
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:04,684
Yes, I know you said you never

695
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:06,353
wanted him to play
with your kids,

696
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:08,556
I just didn't know if,
maybe...

697
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:10,156
- Lloyd!
- Hey, Mom.

698
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,193
No. I've got him right here.
He just walked in. Bye-bye.

699
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:13,660
Oh, my gosh.
I was so worried about you.

700
00:30:13,662 --> 00:30:16,563
Uh, I'm fine. I just took
the long way home.

701
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:17,632
Why did we get
on a family plan

702
00:30:17,634 --> 00:30:19,000
if you're not gonna text me?

703
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:20,501
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to worry you.

704
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:22,235
I love you and I'm sorry.

705
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:25,638
I don't know what I'd do

706
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,274
if anything
ever happened to you, okay?

707
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:28,842
Thanks, Mom.

708
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,310
I'm just really glad that
those ninjas saved the day.

709
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:33,882
Yeah. Yeah, I was there.

710
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:35,183
What?

711
00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:39,185
Watching with
the other regular kids.

712
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:41,655
Okay. Well,
you must be starving.

713
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,491
I don't know,
I'm not really that hungry.

714
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,360
But I'll make your favorite.
Dumplings!

715
00:30:46,362 --> 00:30:49,364
Oh! Enticing,
but I'm just gonna...

716
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:51,132
I'm just gonna go to bed,
I think.

717
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:53,934
Just really tired.

718
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,906
- Oh.
- Good night, Mom.

719
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:00,276
Okay, well, good night.

720
00:31:07,884 --> 00:31:09,714
<i>And back
at number one with a bullet,</i>

721
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:13,820
<i>no surprises there,
is</i> Boo, Lloyd, <i>the remix.</i>

722
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:17,393
<i>L-L...
L-L-O-Y-D...</i>

723
00:31:18,695 --> 00:31:21,828
<i>L-L-O-Y-D.
His dad is bad and so is he.</i>

724
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,631
<i>Boo, Lloyd!
Boo, Lloyd!</i>

725
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,834
- Huh?
- What is that?

726
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:37,677
<i>Hey, Green Ninja, I'm back!</i>

727
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,914
<i>And look
what I brought with me.</i>

728
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:45,254
<i>Breaking news.</i>

729
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,056
Garmadon is attacking the city
in a never-before-seen mech.

730
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:49,388
Run! Run!

731
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:51,591
- Garmadon!
- Garmadon!

732
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:53,260
You all came out to greet me?

733
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:54,760
Don't run away.

734
00:31:54,763 --> 00:31:56,765
That's a nice little
hot dog stand you got there.

735
00:31:57,265 --> 00:31:58,598
Scu-smash!

736
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,267
The Ninjas are going to have

737
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:02,369
their hands full
with this thing.

738
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:03,872
Ninja, go!

739
00:32:08,444 --> 00:32:10,344
We got a message
from your brother Garmadon.

740
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,745
You wanna hear it?

741
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:14,014
Oh, yeah? What did he say?

742
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,716
He says you're a big stupid
dumb-dumb with a dumb face

743
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:18,184
and a big butt
and your butt stinks

744
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,120
and you smell like a butt.

745
00:32:20,122 --> 00:32:22,088
That sounds like my brother.

746
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,257
Get him!

747
00:32:29,465 --> 00:32:30,897
- Jay.
- Yeah?

748
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,098
You take the air.

749
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,734
Kai, Zane and Cole, downtown.

750
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:36,603
- Nya, water.
- You got it.

751
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:38,070
I'm going
after Garmadon.

752
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:40,508
Why don't I take
your dad this time?

753
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,742
I got this. I'm totes profesh.

754
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,278
Wait.
What does that mean?

755
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,346
I think he's trying to say
he's a total professional.

756
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:48,080
Then why is he
totes abbrevin'?

757
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,715
I'm pretty sure
Lloyd's nervous.

758
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,853
What?
That's crazy talk.

759
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:54,055
Incorrect.

760
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,489
Hey, I got this!

761
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:57,157
Stand down, Garmadon.

762
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,059
<i>Well, hello, Green Ninja!</i>

763
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:02,829
It's time for you
to ninja go away for good.

764
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:03,897
Take this!

765
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,499
<i>Mega missile mode.</i>

766
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:06,901
<i>Left claw missile.
Toenail missile. Wrist rocket.</i>

767
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,036
<i>Feet bombs. Spine missile one,
two, three, four.</i>

768
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:10,270
<i>Tail rocket one, two.</i>

769
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:11,805
<i>Eye missile.
Other eye missile.</i>

770
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:14,040
<i>Tongue rocket. Head missile.
Other head missile.</i>

771
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,878
<i>Backup head missile.
Butt torpedoes.</i>

772
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,819
<i>Your weapons are powerless
against my new mech.</i>

773
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:24,518
What?

774
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:29,357
Well, take this!

775
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,157
<i>Releasing full payload.</i>

776
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,492
Here it comes...

777
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:34,060
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

778
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:36,329
You having trouble with that
dragon mech, Green Ninja?

779
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,066
Bye-bye.

780
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:40,503
Wait. No!

781
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:44,805
<i>Jay, what's happening?</i>

782
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:46,874
Garmadon has
taken out Lloyd.

783
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:48,308
<i>- What?
- Wait, what?</i>

784
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,842
<i>I'm sorry.
What did you say?</i>

785
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:53,013
<i>Repeat.
Garmadon has taken out Lloyd!</i>

786
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:02,055
Looks like the police,
the army

787
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:03,389
and the coast guard have

788
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:05,826
<i>all been rendered useless
by Garmadon's forces.</i>

789
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,898
<i>Guys, Garmadon's
almost at city hall.</i>

790
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,467
<i>Can one of you
please stop him?</i>

791
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,068
<i>I'm swamped down here.</i>

792
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:16,670
<i>I'm a little busy.</i>

793
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:19,373
<i>Look at me go!</i>

794
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,977
<i>Who wants a shark?
You want a shark?</i>

795
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,112
<i>You get a shark!</i>

796
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:26,380
We're shark bait!

797
00:34:26,382 --> 00:34:27,947
Come on, come on, come on.

798
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:40,462
Just walking up the tower.

799
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:45,933
Uh, Lloyd would be
really beneficial right now.

800
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:48,768
Where are you, Lloyd?

801
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,070
I'm a ninja master!

802
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:56,076
You are no match
for me! Whoo-hoo!

803
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:58,878
I came here to drink boba
and kick butt,

804
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,417
and I am all out of boba.

805
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,388
Hey, NINJAGO!

806
00:35:09,391 --> 00:35:11,192
Oh, wait. That's bad.

807
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:15,195
<i>Garmadon
is conquering NINJAGO!</i>

808
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,733
<i>Robin, this is a day
that will live in infamy.</i>

809
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:22,168
- I just made that up.
- No, you didn't.

810
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,704
Yes, I did.
Copyright, Michael Strahan.

811
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:24,770
It's mine now.

812
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:27,039
Whoo! I've done it!

813
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,478
I'm finally the ruler
of NINJAGO!

814
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,279
Forever! And ever!

815
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:37,953
Stand down, Garmadon!

816
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:42,192
Green Ninja?

817
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:46,626
And the legendary
Ultimate Weapon?

818
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:48,464
Ugh, it's not fair.

819
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:54,432
I'm sick and tired of you
trying to conquer NINJAGO!

820
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:57,804
All right, Green Ninja.
Now, listen. Just calm down.

821
00:35:57,806 --> 00:35:59,606
You don't have to use
that thing.

822
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:01,174
So you're gonna leave NINJAGO?

823
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:02,341
- Yeah.
- Forever?

824
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:04,277
I promise.

825
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:06,246
Why is your hand
behind your back?

826
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,382
What are you doing back there?
Are you crossing your fingers?

827
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:10,116
That's physically impossible.

828
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:12,286
How could I be crossing my
fingers? I have these things.

829
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:13,552
I'm warning you, Garmadon!

830
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:15,788
Fine! No crossies!
No crossies!

831
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,791
Just chill. Okay.
Look,

832
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,425
I'm getting rid
of all my sharks.

833
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,161
See? No sharks.

834
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:23,095
And the sharks
in your ankle holster.

835
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,831
I don't have any sharks.

836
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,967
- What's in your ankle?
- It's a couple dolphins, man.

837
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:29,203
Now you're acting loco.
I mean...

838
00:36:29,205 --> 00:36:30,370
Hey! Get rid of 'em.

839
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:32,672
Fine. You happy now?

840
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:35,006
I'm done. You win.

841
00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:36,642
What are you doing?
What are you doing right now?

842
00:36:36,644 --> 00:36:38,478
Easy, Green Ninja.

843
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,645
Don't come any closer!

844
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,148
Easy.

845
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,015
I'm warning you,
Garmadon.

846
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:46,152
Let's just keep
this interaction very chill.

847
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:49,222
I'm the definition
of chill right now!

848
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:51,090
I know.

849
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,395
Stand back!

850
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:58,664
Put down the Ultimate Weapon,
Green Ninja.

851
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,666
We both know
you're not gonna fire it.

852
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:02,936
Oh, yeah?
This is your last chance.

853
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:07,273
Get out of NINJAGO,
now and forever!

854
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,543
No.

855
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:10,310
All right, fine.
You ready for this?

856
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,678
- Yeah.
- It's coming.

857
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,112
- Okay.
- You've been warned.

858
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:14,680
- I'm waiting.
- Here it comes.

859
00:37:14,682 --> 00:37:16,349
- Any time.
- All right,

860
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:18,585
here it comes!

861
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:19,987
Oh, my gosh!

862
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:23,023
He actually shot
and it exploded, and then...

863
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:26,726
But nothing is happening.
Why is nothing happening?

864
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,027
What the heck?

865
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:29,563
It's like
the Ultimate Lamest Weapon.

866
00:37:29,565 --> 00:37:31,330
Come on!

867
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,866
Why won't you work?

868
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:35,735
Get off my Vespa!

869
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,176
You hear that?

870
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,045
What have you done?

871
00:37:49,618 --> 00:37:51,119
Whoa.

872
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:59,295
Aw!

873
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:04,900
How do I turn this thing off?

874
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:08,466
Ah.

875
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:09,703
Come on!

876
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:14,808
Generals,
grab the Green Ninja.

877
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,378
Keep away.

878
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:20,114
Whoa. Whoa.

879
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:21,715
Wait!

880
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:22,782
Wait! No, no, no!

881
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:24,083
Remember, Green Ninja,

882
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:26,887
I didn't fire this thing
first. That's on you.

883
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,956
But, since you got it all
warmed up,

884
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,657
let's try it
on some moving targets.

885
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:35,663
No!

886
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:40,770
What the heck!

887
00:38:45,775 --> 00:38:48,342
Stop it, Garmadon!
Just stop it!

888
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,314
What is this thing?

889
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,360
I'm gonna throw up!

890
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:13,835
Prolonged scream.

891
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:22,878
Five ninjas down,

892
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:24,446
one to go.

893
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,795
Bang! I win! Cue the music!

894
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:44,265
Whoo!

895
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:48,701
Awesome job, sir!

896
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:50,771
What? Are you gonna cry?

897
00:39:50,773 --> 00:39:52,206
I'm not gonna cry.

898
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,738
I bet he's gonna cry.

899
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:57,714
I'm not gonna cry...

900
00:39:58,246 --> 00:39:59,246
Dad.

901
00:40:06,422 --> 00:40:07,420
La-Loyd?

902
00:40:07,422 --> 00:40:10,623
That's right!
It's me! Your son!

903
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,658
And it's Lloyd, Dad.

904
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,829
No. L-L-O-Y-D. I named you.

905
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,298
You ruined my life!

906
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,737
How could I ruin your life?
I wasn't even there.

907
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:36,418
I wish you weren't my father.

908
00:40:53,302 --> 00:40:56,101
And we're back in
three, two, one...

909
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:58,806
Welcome back, NINJAGO.
I'm Robin Roberts.

910
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:00,672
And as you can see,
our city is in the midst

911
00:41:00,674 --> 00:41:02,409
of total annihilation.

912
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:04,110
<i>And for a city
that gets attacked</i>

913
00:41:04,112 --> 00:41:05,779
<i>pretty frequently, Robin...</i>

914
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,348
<i>...that's really
saying something.</i>

915
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:10,217
<i>As we struggle
to survive,</i>

916
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:12,119
<i>we're left
with so many questions like,</i>

917
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:14,221
<i>"Who has
truly conquered NINJAGO?"</i>

918
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,525
<i>The monster?</i>

919
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:20,259
<i>Or Garmadon?</i>

920
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:22,295
We did it!

921
00:41:22,297 --> 00:41:23,366
Party time!

922
00:41:25,368 --> 00:41:26,464
Incoming!

923
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:27,633
We did it!

924
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:29,636
Let's go.

925
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:34,041
"I wish you weren't
my father."

926
00:41:34,043 --> 00:41:35,641
Huh?

927
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:38,145
Is it just me, or was that
kind of a weird thing to say?

928
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:40,045
"I wish
you weren't my father."

929
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:42,849
And the tone,
it was so disrespectful.

930
00:41:42,851 --> 00:41:44,451
Yes, sir.
Plus, he tried to shoot you.

931
00:41:44,453 --> 00:41:47,253
Yeah! Right before you
totally conquered his city!

932
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,322
We
conquered your greatest foe,

933
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:51,125
turned out to be
your son though...

934
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:52,625
I'm sure he meant it
as a compliment,

935
00:41:52,627 --> 00:41:56,063
but it's a weird thing, right?
General Number One!

936
00:41:56,065 --> 00:41:57,163
Sir!

937
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,831
Have you captured my son yet?

938
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,099
No, not yet, sir.

939
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,668
And yet, here you are.

940
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,037
Partying on the rooftops

941
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,706
with a paper umbrella
in your drink.

942
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:09,208
What about
La-Loyd's ninja friends?

943
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,676
You captured any of them yet?

944
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:12,112
No, sir.

945
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:13,947
And what about my brother, Wu?

946
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,581
No, sir.

947
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:18,217
What about my ex, Koko?
You found her?

948
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:20,487
No, sir.

949
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:21,753
Well, you certainly
had no trouble

950
00:42:21,755 --> 00:42:22,822
finding the bar, did you?

951
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:24,257
We're on it, sir.

952
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:25,625
We searched the whole city
from top to bottom.

953
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:28,060
You're not on the list.
Oh! My clipboard!

954
00:42:28,063 --> 00:42:30,499
Look, here she is now.

955
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:39,840
Hey, Koko.
Glad you made it to the party.

956
00:42:39,842 --> 00:42:41,339
Pretty on the chain, isn't it?

957
00:42:41,341 --> 00:42:43,677
Wipe that smile off your face,
Garmadon.

958
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,311
Ugh, same old Kokes.

959
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,114
It just kills you to see me
having any fun, doesn't it?

960
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:49,982
Oh, by the way,
uh, quick question.

961
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,284
What was it again?

962
00:42:51,286 --> 00:42:53,487
Oh, yeah. Why did you
turn our son against me?

963
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:56,354
Me? You turned him
against you, Garm.

964
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:58,190
You're a maniacal
twisted villain.

965
00:42:58,192 --> 00:43:00,159
All right, look,
enough with the compliments.

966
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,262
Whose idea was it for him
to become a ninja?

967
00:43:02,264 --> 00:43:04,130
Lloyd is not a ninja.

968
00:43:04,132 --> 00:43:06,032
Who's the absentee parent now?

969
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:07,333
What are you talking about?

970
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,837
La-Loyd. He's the Green Ninja.

971
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:11,971
One of my greatest enemies,

972
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,273
honor-bound
and sworn to destroy me.

973
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:17,143
You know what he said to me?
He said that he wished...

974
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:18,945
What have you done with him?

975
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:24,286
Where's Lloyd?

976
00:43:25,922 --> 00:43:27,920
My gosh, woman,
what happened to us?

977
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:31,291
- Ugh.
- I miss that fire.

978
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:34,392
You know, I've always tried
to get Lloyd to see

979
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:37,663
that he shouldn't be ashamed
of who his father is.

980
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:40,500
But now,

981
00:43:40,502 --> 00:43:43,139
I'm starting to think
he could be right.

982
00:44:30,185 --> 00:44:33,121
Oh, no. No, no. Please.
Please, no.

983
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,992
Uncle Wu...

984
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,529
Oh, my gosh!
You guys are okay!

985
00:44:42,531 --> 00:44:43,396
Barely.

986
00:44:43,398 --> 00:44:45,099
You used the Ultimate Weapon.

987
00:44:45,101 --> 00:44:46,300
Not cool.

988
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:47,701
Dude,
our mechs are totaled.

989
00:44:47,703 --> 00:44:49,335
And now,
that cat's destroying NINJAGO.

990
00:44:49,337 --> 00:44:51,204
We were the only people
that didn't hate you,

991
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:52,806
and now we hate you!

992
00:44:52,808 --> 00:44:56,107
Deleting all data related to
treating Lloyd as a friend.

993
00:44:58,145 --> 00:44:59,913
Guys, I'm sorry.

994
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:04,817
I put everyone in danger
and now Master Wu is dead.

995
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:06,853
Hello, students.

996
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:08,120
Master Wu!

997
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:10,022
You're alive!

998
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:12,024
Duh! I'm a ninja master.

999
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:16,061
If I was gonna die, it would
be to teach you a lesson.

1000
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:19,866
Lloyd, you have
awakened Meowthra.

1001
00:45:19,868 --> 00:45:20,933
Meowthra?

1002
00:45:20,935 --> 00:45:22,701
Yes, Meowthra.

1003
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:27,474
<i>The six-toed fluffy demon,
with her sandpaper tongue.</i>

1004
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:30,776
<i>Her reign of terror
will stretch on and on</i>

1005
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:35,680
<i>until all of NINJAGO is her
own personal litter box.</i>

1006
00:45:37,786 --> 00:45:39,217
There's only one hope.

1007
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:42,521
One thing that can drive
Meowthra away.

1008
00:45:42,523 --> 00:45:44,456
- What?
- What is it?

1009
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:46,561
The Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

1010
00:45:51,632 --> 00:45:52,998
Whoa!

1011
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,266
Where is this thing?

1012
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:56,469
On the other side
of the island,

1013
00:45:56,471 --> 00:45:59,972
hidden where only a true
ninja master can find it.

1014
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:02,308
<i>You must follow
the right path.</i>

1015
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,411
<i>Otherwise you will end up</i>

1016
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:08,714
<i>trapped in the deadly
Jungle of Lost Souls,</i>

1017
00:46:08,717 --> 00:46:11,918
<i>unable to cross the Bridge
of Fallen Mentors,</i>

1018
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,455
<i>and mired in the Canyon of
General Unhappiness.</i>

1019
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,257
And if you're still alive,

1020
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:19,592
<i>you'll be crushed</i>

1021
00:46:19,594 --> 00:46:21,034
<i>by the Temple of
Fragile Foundations.</i>

1022
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:25,864
It's a journey many have tried
and none have returned.

1023
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,400
That does sound difficult.

1024
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:29,634
And terrifying.

1025
00:46:29,636 --> 00:46:31,137
But you know what?
We're ready.

1026
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:32,672
No, you're not.

1027
00:46:32,674 --> 00:46:35,708
It will take great patience,
courage, and hard work.

1028
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,777
All the skills
of a true ninja master.

1029
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:43,416
So, I will make this journey
on my own. Bye.

1030
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:44,983
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Master Wu, wait!

1031
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:47,521
Hold on a second, please.

1032
00:46:47,523 --> 00:46:49,554
Master Wu,
I know I let NINJAGO down.

1033
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,326
It's true, Lloyd let
NINJAGO down. Sorry, dude!

1034
00:46:52,328 --> 00:46:53,860
We want to fix
his terrible mistake.

1035
00:46:53,862 --> 00:46:55,761
- Train us to be true ninjas.
- We have the potential.

1036
00:46:55,764 --> 00:46:57,230
- Come on!
- Wait! We'll do anything.

1037
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,831
Please, Master Wu,

1038
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,500
you can't do this alone.

1039
00:47:00,502 --> 00:47:02,467
I know we're not
ninja masters yet,

1040
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:04,337
but you said it yourself.

1041
00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:07,706
It's important
to look at things differently.

1042
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:11,813
Is there anything I can do
to change your point of view?

1043
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:14,213
Hmm.

1044
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:17,752
Students, are you willing
to give Lloyd a second chance?

1045
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:20,887
Uh...

1046
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:22,053
- Too soon.
- No.

1047
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:23,355
- Pass.
- Just processing, so...

1048
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:25,358
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1049
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,527
Lloyd, you have
a long way to go

1050
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:30,062
to regain your friends' trust.

1051
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:34,333
Luckily, there's a long
journey ahead of us.

1052
00:47:34,335 --> 00:47:36,902
Thank you, Master Wu.
Thank you.

1053
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:40,239
The fate of NINJAGO
is in your hands.

1054
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:41,375
Are you ready?

1055
00:47:41,377 --> 00:47:43,108
- Yes, I am on it!
- Oh, yeah!

1056
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,709
- Yep!
- Maybe.

1057
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:45,813
Let's go!

1058
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:55,657
Sir, I think we found them.

1059
00:47:56,924 --> 00:47:58,759
There's a group of
brightly colored ninjas

1060
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:01,527
heading towards the obviously
dangerous jungle.

1061
00:48:01,529 --> 00:48:04,130
Mm. Zoom in a little closer.

1062
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,697
Closer.

1063
00:48:07,268 --> 00:48:09,902
No, closer. Closer.

1064
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:13,507
Yes! Right in on my stupid
brother's dirty beard.

1065
00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:16,074
What's he saying?
Something about a weapon.

1066
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:18,377
The Omelet Omelet weapon.

1067
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,480
It sounds delicious.

1068
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:22,782
Delicious, yet quite possibly
dangerous.

1069
00:48:22,784 --> 00:48:25,651
He's talking about
an Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

1070
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,554
That's what I said,
the Ultimate Omelet Weapon.

1071
00:48:28,556 --> 00:48:30,290
Sir, where are you going?

1072
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:31,657
This is pure warrior stuff.

1073
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,726
Alone in the field,
tracking ninjas.

1074
00:48:33,728 --> 00:48:35,493
Finding out exactly
what La-Loyd meant

1075
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,697
when he said, "I wish
you weren't my father."

1076
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:39,501
So, I guess
I'm going to the jungle.

1077
00:49:06,594 --> 00:49:08,694
Dope fluting, Master Wu.

1078
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:09,697
Thank you.

1079
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,166
Students,

1080
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:18,639
your elemental powers come
from this lush green world.

1081
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:22,610
Feel the energy
flowing through you.

1082
00:49:24,513 --> 00:49:26,913
Good. Good.

1083
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:29,817
The power is inside you.

1084
00:49:30,652 --> 00:49:33,119
Now say to yourself,

1085
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:35,221
"I've got the power."

1086
00:49:39,094 --> 00:49:40,595
I've got the power!

1087
00:49:41,295 --> 00:49:42,498
What was that?

1088
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:47,502
Mm. Ninja tracks!

1089
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:52,404
I sense the presence of evil.

1090
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,873
Students, true ninja knows
when to fight

1091
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:57,576
and when to become one
with the elements.

1092
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,512
<i>Quickly, blend in the shadows.</i>

1093
00:50:02,683 --> 00:50:04,717
You are all terrible ninjas.

1094
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,487
I will take care of Garmadon
on my own.

1095
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:08,554
I'm close.

1096
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:10,824
- He's close.
- Real close.

1097
00:50:10,826 --> 00:50:12,094
Really close.

1098
00:50:19,134 --> 00:50:20,266
- You!
- You!

1099
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,913
Oh, hello, brother.

1100
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:38,918
Where are your
little ninja nerds?

1101
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,051
Nailed it.

1102
00:50:40,053 --> 00:50:41,221
They are surrounding you,

1103
00:50:41,223 --> 00:50:43,055
perfectly hidden.
Ready to strike.

1104
00:50:43,058 --> 00:50:44,491
Oh, really?

1105
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:48,360
Students, next lesson.

1106
00:50:48,362 --> 00:50:50,096
How to fight
like a true ninja...

1107
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,373
Ow! Ow!

1108
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,873
Ow!

1109
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:02,877
Huh?

1110
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:10,583
Ah.

1111
00:51:10,585 --> 00:51:13,585
Oh, look at me!
I'm Master Wu!

1112
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:16,657
Today's lesson is something
totally boring!

1113
00:51:21,797 --> 00:51:23,163
Looks like you need a lesson

1114
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:25,599
in learning how to shut
your stupid face.

1115
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:27,500
Well, here's something
you won't learn in school,

1116
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,601
the Seven Deadly Butterflies
of Shaolin.

1117
00:51:29,603 --> 00:51:31,102
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven!

1118
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:32,940
I don't need a deadly
butterfly to beat you.

1119
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:35,808
Hyah!

1120
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:37,677
We are totes
blending in right now.

1121
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:38,911
I can still see you!

1122
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:40,581
- Oh, man.
- Come on, this way.

1123
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:55,029
Ho-ho! Wu's your daddy?

1124
00:51:57,598 --> 00:51:59,133
- Huh?
- Ha!

1125
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:02,735
Get off of my head.

1126
00:52:02,737 --> 00:52:04,003
Hey, bro,
get off my foot!

1127
00:52:04,005 --> 00:52:05,304
- Get off!
- No, you get off my foot

1128
00:52:05,306 --> 00:52:06,808
so I can kick you in the head.

1129
00:52:13,313 --> 00:52:14,614
Whoa!

1130
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,985
Ow.

1131
00:52:18,987 --> 00:52:20,051
Master Wu!

1132
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,387
- Look out! He's behind you!
- Where?

1133
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:26,458
Oh!

1134
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,828
Really? Tighty-whities? Still?

1135
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,496
Face it,
you're out of moves, Wu.

1136
00:52:30,498 --> 00:52:32,599
Oh, yeah? How about this one?

1137
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:33,836
Oh-oh.

1138
00:52:35,203 --> 00:52:37,603
I call it the Caged Monkey..

1139
00:52:37,605 --> 00:52:39,271
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me!

1140
00:52:39,273 --> 00:52:41,171
Gasp.

1141
00:52:41,174 --> 00:52:42,675
And that, my students,

1142
00:52:42,677 --> 00:52:45,545
is how you fight
like a true ninja.

1143
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:47,812
Well, a true ninja

1144
00:52:47,815 --> 00:52:50,016
would have counted
all seven butterflies.

1145
00:52:50,018 --> 00:52:51,483
What? I did.

1146
00:52:51,485 --> 00:52:54,253
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

1147
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,422
Seven.

1148
00:53:00,895 --> 00:53:02,195
No!

1149
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:26,886
Master Wu!

1150
00:53:26,888 --> 00:53:29,322
Lloyd, always remember...

1151
00:53:29,324 --> 00:53:30,655
Yeah?

1152
00:53:30,657 --> 00:53:34,293
Stay on the right path
to find your inner peace.

1153
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:35,962
- No, no, no.
- Oh, my gosh!

1154
00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:37,630
Master Wu, we need you,
please! Don't leave!

1155
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:38,864
Uncle Wu!

1156
00:53:38,866 --> 00:53:41,099
Did he say inner peace?

1157
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:42,235
The right path?

1158
00:53:42,237 --> 00:53:43,536
Why is he bringing
these things up

1159
00:53:43,538 --> 00:53:45,204
so late in our adventure?

1160
00:53:45,206 --> 00:53:47,074
Well, well, well.

1161
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:54,582
Looks like your precious
ninja master's gone.

1162
00:53:55,882 --> 00:53:57,217
Now, come on, La-Loyd.

1163
00:53:57,219 --> 00:53:59,886
Open the cage.
Let out your papa.

1164
00:53:59,888 --> 00:54:01,687
So, now you wanna be my dad?

1165
00:54:01,689 --> 00:54:03,623
I'm not gonna
ask you again, La-Loyd.

1166
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,761
Open the cage right now.

1167
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:07,628
One...

1168
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:10,132
Two...

1169
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,801
Three...

1170
00:54:15,268 --> 00:54:17,235
I thought that was
supposed to work with kids.

1171
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:20,005
Listen, La-Loyd and friends
whose names I don't know...

1172
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,775
- I'm Jay.
- It's not a question.

1173
00:54:21,777 --> 00:54:24,075
Oh.

1174
00:54:24,077 --> 00:54:26,112
Now, for you to make it
through this journey alive,

1175
00:54:26,114 --> 00:54:28,681
you're gonna need someone
to teach you the ninja way.

1176
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:30,082
What do you know
about being a ninja?

1177
00:54:30,085 --> 00:54:32,384
Oh, I know plenty, La-Loyd.

1178
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:34,718
You don't get to be a warlord
without knowing a thing or two

1179
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,221
about the ninja arts.

1180
00:54:36,223 --> 00:54:38,257
The dark ninja arts.

1181
00:54:39,725 --> 00:54:41,559
What is that?

1182
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:42,628
You're a ninja?

1183
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,197
Indeed, I am.

1184
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:46,532
As a matter of fact, I wrote
the book on Ninjelligence.

1185
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,832
Why are there
so many one-star reviews?

1186
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:50,770
I think that's trolls,
personally.

1187
00:54:50,772 --> 00:54:52,538
- Oh.
- We don't need your book,

1188
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,139
Garmadon. Wu is our master.

1189
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:55,641
Well, Wu is gone.

1190
00:54:55,643 --> 00:54:57,976
And you're gonna need me to
get you out of this jungle,

1191
00:54:57,978 --> 00:54:59,143
or you're all gonna die.

1192
00:54:59,145 --> 00:55:00,945
Oh, great!
We're all gonna die.

1193
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:02,581
We're not gonna die, Jay.

1194
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,383
And while
I'm keeping you alive,

1195
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:07,587
maybe I'll teach you some of
my sick dark ninja moves,

1196
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:09,288
like the Buzzkill.

1197
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,255
Wow.

1198
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:11,824
- The Miso Slap.
- Wow.

1199
00:55:11,826 --> 00:55:13,659
- Or the Chainsaw Chop.
- Wow.

1200
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:15,493
- Or the Dance of Doom.
- Wow.

1201
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:16,962
Hang on just a second.

1202
00:55:16,964 --> 00:55:19,031
This is Garmadon
we're talking about.

1203
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:20,366
We can still make it to

1204
00:55:20,368 --> 00:55:22,301
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon
on our own.

1205
00:55:22,303 --> 00:55:24,637
We just have to remember
what Master Wu taught us.

1206
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,007
All I can remember is
we really need a ninja master.

1207
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:30,678
And you are not
a ninja master.

1208
00:55:31,813 --> 00:55:33,913
So what are we gonna do?

1209
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,382
We take him.

1210
00:55:36,384 --> 00:55:37,886
Fantastic!

1211
00:55:40,188 --> 00:55:41,587
You know what's funny?

1212
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:44,857
I had La-Loyd
when I was 158 years old.

1213
00:55:44,859 --> 00:55:46,625
- Wow.
- Wait a minute.

1214
00:55:46,627 --> 00:55:49,526
- You're 174?
- Yes.

1215
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:52,097
Master Wu says he's 167,

1216
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,064
and he's your younger brother?

1217
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:55,367
He's my younger brother.
Correct.

1218
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:58,170
How is that possible?
You look much...

1219
00:55:58,172 --> 00:55:59,137
Younger.

1220
00:55:59,139 --> 00:56:00,672
- Thank you.
- Yeah, do you moisturize?

1221
00:56:00,674 --> 00:56:03,043
Yes, that's when I got
the upper hand on Master Wu.

1222
00:56:03,045 --> 00:56:05,009
- "Upper hands."
- Yeah, upper hands.

1223
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:06,545
How did you gain two arms?

1224
00:56:06,547 --> 00:56:07,980
Oh, don't put it like that.

1225
00:56:07,982 --> 00:56:09,748
I don't know if that's
the best way to say it.

1226
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,282
- Well, he's got four arms.
- Correct!

1227
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,985
You know, a lot of people
don't ask me about it.

1228
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:14,920
So, I'm glad
that he's comfortable asking.

1229
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:16,188
Lloyd's never asked me once
about my arms.

1230
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:18,590
- Have you, Lloyd?
- Don't talk to me.

1231
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:19,692
I was bit by a snake.

1232
00:56:19,694 --> 00:56:20,893
- No!
- Yes.

1233
00:56:20,895 --> 00:56:22,195
So the snake
had a bunch of arms?

1234
00:56:22,197 --> 00:56:23,828
- They don't have arms.
- Exactly.

1235
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:24,896
Do you mean like a spider?

1236
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:26,266
Oh, no, I was bit by a snake.

1237
00:56:26,268 --> 00:56:27,800
And the snake
had been bitten by a spider.

1238
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:28,902
And then the snake bit me.

1239
00:56:28,904 --> 00:56:30,402
- Oh.
- Are you guys actually

1240
00:56:30,404 --> 00:56:31,837
buying any of this?

1241
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,438
How else would you explain it,
La-Loyd? You weren't there.

1242
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,275
So, when the two extra arms
started growing,

1243
00:56:35,277 --> 00:56:36,909
were you like, "Yes, this is
awesome!" Or were you like...

1244
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:38,444
No, at first, I was, like,
totally freaked out,

1245
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:40,482
and sometimes
I get self-conscious about it.

1246
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:43,616
Hey, uh, Garmadon.

1247
00:56:43,618 --> 00:56:44,683
Can I ask you
another question?

1248
00:56:44,685 --> 00:56:46,217
Yeah, go ahead.

1249
00:56:46,219 --> 00:56:48,954
It's about the arms. Um,
can you shake your own hand?

1250
00:56:48,956 --> 00:56:51,056
- Look! Check it out, ninjas.
- Oh, my gosh.

1251
00:56:51,058 --> 00:56:52,858
Oh, he's his own best friend!

1252
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,124
Oh, the double shake!

1253
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:55,594
I love your bad boy charm.

1254
00:56:55,596 --> 00:56:57,329
Look at this. This is one of
my favorite things.

1255
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,963
I look like I'm making out
with two people, don't I?

1256
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:01,266
- I'm impressed.
- Wonderful amusement!

1257
00:57:01,268 --> 00:57:03,235
Hey, you know what?
We should, uh...

1258
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:05,637
We should be
practicing silence right now.

1259
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,072
Sorry.

1260
00:57:07,074 --> 00:57:09,708
It's just, when you talk,
I don't wanna listen,

1261
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:12,078
but when he talks,
I wanna listen.

1262
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:12,978
I agree.

1263
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,412
I've always said
he's weak-voiced.

1264
00:57:14,415 --> 00:57:15,882
I think we're gettin'
off point a little bit,

1265
00:57:15,884 --> 00:57:17,250
just a little bit.

1266
00:57:17,252 --> 00:57:18,518
You see what I mean
about the weak voice?

1267
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,985
"Like a little bit!"

1268
00:57:19,987 --> 00:57:21,219
- That's how he talks.
- Do it again.

1269
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:22,755
"A little bit!"

1270
00:57:22,757 --> 00:57:24,323
Oh, that's not how I...
That doesn't sound like me!

1271
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:26,625
His sounds more like this.

1272
00:57:26,627 --> 00:57:27,994
Look what he's doing to us!

1273
00:57:27,996 --> 00:57:30,096
We have to focus.
He's turning our minds.

1274
00:57:30,098 --> 00:57:31,563
Thank you, Zane. You get it.

1275
00:57:31,565 --> 00:57:34,835
My sensors indicate
a fork in the road.

1276
00:57:35,871 --> 00:57:37,435
Hmm.

1277
00:57:37,438 --> 00:57:40,739
The right path is long,
and arduous, and enlightening.

1278
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:43,509
And the left... A shortcut!

1279
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:45,043
Why would
they say "possible"?

1280
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,411
They would know, right?

1281
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:47,947
We're taking the shortcut.
Let's roll!

1282
00:57:47,949 --> 00:57:49,681
No, no.
Okay. Just wait.

1283
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:52,217
Master Wu said we should stay
on the right path.

1284
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,552
What?

1285
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:55,121
You wanna listen to the guy
who fell off the bridge,

1286
00:57:55,123 --> 00:57:56,763
or the guy who didn't
fall off the bridge?

1287
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,393
Hey, Zane,
could you record this

1288
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,027
and then
never play it back to me?

1289
00:58:03,029 --> 00:58:05,432
Yes.

1290
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:09,335
Um... Guys?

1291
00:58:09,337 --> 00:58:11,540
Maybe this isn't
such a great idea.

1292
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:22,215
This is my least favorite
place I've ever been in.

1293
00:58:22,217 --> 00:58:25,287
Did you hear that?

1294
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:29,188
- We're backing it out.
- What?

1295
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,989
- We're backing out.
- What did you just say?

1296
00:58:30,991 --> 00:58:32,090
- We're backing out.
- Go, go, go.

1297
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,893
Back it.
Continue to back it out.

1298
00:58:33,895 --> 00:58:35,326
Continue to back it out.

1299
00:58:35,328 --> 00:58:37,096
Alert. More danger.

1300
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:39,065
- I'm gonna throw up.
- What do we do?

1301
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:40,333
There's too many of them.

1302
00:58:40,335 --> 00:58:43,168
Wait a minute.
Oh, my gosh. La-Loyd,

1303
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:46,905
they look like
my former General Number Ones.

1304
00:58:46,907 --> 00:58:48,474
You guys look great.

1305
00:58:48,476 --> 00:58:50,140
Your skin
has such a lovely glow.

1306
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:51,876
Have you all been
tanning lately or something?

1307
00:58:51,878 --> 00:58:54,112
We were fired.

1308
00:58:57,652 --> 00:58:59,783
Out of a volcano.

1309
00:58:59,785 --> 00:59:02,021
Oh! Right, right, right.

1310
00:59:02,023 --> 00:59:03,621
Yeah, but other than that,
you're well?

1311
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,156
Uh, Garmadon,

1312
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:09,094
did you fire all of these
generals out of a volcano?

1313
00:59:09,096 --> 00:59:11,796
No! Not all at the same time.

1314
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:14,366
Don't worry. These guys
are like family. They love me.

1315
00:59:14,368 --> 00:59:17,036
Right, Generals?

1316
00:59:17,038 --> 00:59:20,639
Oh, we're family all right.

1317
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:21,808
Ninja, go!

1318
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:22,875
Guys, wait!

1319
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:24,677
We need to use
our ninja powers.

1320
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:27,146
What do we do? We're worthless
without our mechs.

1321
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,446
Come on. Remember
what Master Wu told us.

1322
00:59:29,448 --> 00:59:32,217
Nya, you can make a flood
to wash these guys outta here.

1323
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:33,585
The only hope
for water is

1324
00:59:33,587 --> 00:59:35,020
if Jay has another accident
in his pants.

1325
00:59:35,022 --> 00:59:37,121
Yeah, she's right.
We gotta get outta here!

1326
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:38,556
- Ow, that hurts.
- Let's go.

1327
00:59:38,558 --> 00:59:40,725
No, no, guys.
Use your elemental powers.

1328
00:59:40,727 --> 00:59:44,465
We have the power!

1329
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:48,634
<i>We've got Garmadon</i>

1330
00:59:48,636 --> 00:59:50,869
<i>And this random kid</i>

1331
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:53,005
<i>We are going to kill them</i>

1332
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:55,273
<i>Oops, we shouldn't have
said that</i>

1333
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:57,342
I command you
to release me and my son.

1334
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,944
That's an order, Generals.

1335
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:00,445
I can't hear you!

1336
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:03,248
I said, I command you
to release me and my son.

1337
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:06,050
Hey, the reason
Bob can't hear

1338
01:00:06,052 --> 01:00:07,585
is 'cause
his eardrums blew up

1339
01:00:07,587 --> 01:00:09,954
after you shot him
out of the volcano!

1340
01:00:09,956 --> 01:00:11,590
I can't hear you!

1341
01:00:11,592 --> 01:00:12,758
You stupid butt!

1342
01:00:12,761 --> 01:00:15,194
What? Can you believe
what they're saying?

1343
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:16,829
It's like I'm being treated
worse than anyone

1344
01:00:16,831 --> 01:00:18,063
in the history of the world.

1345
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:19,397
A good thing you never have to

1346
01:00:19,399 --> 01:00:21,166
experience anything
like this, La-Loyd.

1347
01:00:21,168 --> 01:00:24,103
Yeah. Yeah. No one ever says
mean things to me

1348
01:00:24,105 --> 01:00:27,239
when my dad knocks over
their Pilates studio,

1349
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:30,476
or their waxing salon,
or their kayak repair store,

1350
01:00:30,478 --> 01:00:32,578
or that place
that sells toner cartridges.

1351
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:36,248
And you better believe
no one ever makes fun of me,

1352
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,550
for not knowing
how to throw or catch a ball.

1353
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,652
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

1354
01:00:40,654 --> 01:00:42,419
I know it's funny,
but what kind of jerk

1355
01:00:42,421 --> 01:00:43,688
would make fun of you
for that?

1356
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:44,891
You're kidding, right?

1357
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:46,224
You gotta stand up
for yourself,

1358
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,559
and shoot them out
of a volcano.

1359
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,661
That's how I roll.

1360
01:00:48,663 --> 01:00:50,728
You gotta get yourself
a volcano, kid.

1361
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,333
Yeah.

1362
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,199
Blowing stuff up

1363
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:57,136
and never putting it
back together.

1364
01:00:57,138 --> 01:01:00,241
That is what you're best at,
isn't it?

1365
01:01:03,545 --> 01:01:04,844
Well, hello!

1366
01:01:04,846 --> 01:01:07,444
We have got a present for you.

1367
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:10,016
Fire him! Fire him! Fire him!

1368
01:01:10,018 --> 01:01:12,684
Oh, an exact reproduction
of my volcanic lair.

1369
01:01:12,686 --> 01:01:13,718
And let me guess,

1370
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,353
you're going to fire us
out of it.

1371
01:01:15,355 --> 01:01:19,192
Oh, no, we're gonna fire you
into the volcano.

1372
01:01:19,194 --> 01:01:22,061
The 15 million kelvin magma
will melt your skin

1373
01:01:22,063 --> 01:01:23,862
before you can even feel
the heat!

1374
01:01:23,864 --> 01:01:26,666
Omar, take them to the top.

1375
01:01:26,668 --> 01:01:27,898
Okey-dokey.

1376
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,670
Up you go!

1377
01:01:36,177 --> 01:01:39,645
Whoa.

1378
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:40,846
What is that?

1379
01:01:40,848 --> 01:01:42,681
- Hey!
- What's up?

1380
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:45,650
Zane! Are you okay?

1381
01:01:45,652 --> 01:01:47,719
I think I might be
an adrenaline junkie.

1382
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,454
I got you, dude!
I got you!

1383
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,122
I really could've walked out
by myself,

1384
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,124
but thank you. Ow!

1385
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,059
Wait, where's Lloyd?

1386
01:01:55,061 --> 01:01:56,695
- Um...
- Uh...

1387
01:01:56,697 --> 01:01:58,096
Oh, no.

1388
01:01:58,098 --> 01:02:00,266
I can't believe we just ran
off and left him back there.

1389
01:02:00,268 --> 01:02:01,366
This is terrible.

1390
01:02:01,368 --> 01:02:03,101
We are horrible friends.

1391
01:02:03,103 --> 01:02:05,136
And sub-par ninjas, too.

1392
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,505
That's right. That's right.

1393
01:02:06,507 --> 01:02:08,741
Wait. Guys...

1394
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:11,811
Fire him! Fire him!

1395
01:02:11,813 --> 01:02:13,545
- Um...
- Oh, no!

1396
01:02:13,547 --> 01:02:14,447
Lloyd!

1397
01:02:14,449 --> 01:02:16,114
- He's in trouble.
- Oh, man.

1398
01:02:16,116 --> 01:02:17,250
What are we going to do?

1399
01:02:17,252 --> 01:02:18,851
We can still do this, guys.

1400
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:22,355
We just gotta figure out
how to be real ninjas.

1401
01:02:22,357 --> 01:02:24,055
You know what would be
really brave?

1402
01:02:24,057 --> 01:02:25,690
Making camp,
sleeping for the night,

1403
01:02:25,692 --> 01:02:26,824
wake up in the day.

1404
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,293
Yeah, that's brave.

1405
01:02:28,295 --> 01:02:30,695
Wait, Zane, don't you have,
like, 700 gigabytes

1406
01:02:30,697 --> 01:02:32,565
of martial arts movies
on your hard drive?

01:02:34,368 --> 01:02:36,000

We just ate!

1427

Oh, man.
We did all that stuff

that you and Master Wu
told us to do.

01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:02,419
Whoa!

1440
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,922
All right.
Let's get outta here

1441
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:05,824
and make it to
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

1442
01:04:05,826 --> 01:04:07,792
That's not gonna be easy,
girl ninja.

1443
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:10,529
Because I fired
a ridic amount of generals.

1444
01:04:10,531 --> 01:04:11,896
All right, all right.
I got an idea.

1445
01:04:11,898 --> 01:04:14,299
If we can hold these
generals off long enough,

1446
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:15,733
we can build a way
out of here.

1447
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:17,603
Great idea.
You kids start building.

1448
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:19,204
La-Loyd and I will
throw you bricks.

1449
01:04:19,206 --> 01:04:21,139
Lloyd, I need a two-by-two.

1450
01:04:21,141 --> 01:04:22,741
Here it comes.

1451
01:04:22,743 --> 01:04:23,608
That was terrible.

1452
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,110
Throw me a couple one-bys.

1453
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,179
I got it. Check this out.

1454
01:04:27,181 --> 01:04:28,547
How can you be so bad at this?

1455
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:30,080
Yeah. You got a mental block?

1456
01:04:30,082 --> 01:04:31,550
Hang on, everybody.

1457
01:04:31,552 --> 01:04:32,716
You ninjas, keep at it.

1458
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:34,084
La-Loyd, you're coming
with me.

1459
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:35,420
I'll be in charge
of the tunes.

1460
01:04:35,422 --> 01:04:36,855
I'll just put it
on shuffle here.

1461
01:04:36,857 --> 01:04:38,690
Please not Jim Croce,
please not Jim Croce.

1462
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,159
Ah! Jinxed us. Whatever.

1463
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:42,962
All right!
Ninjas, keep building!

1464
01:04:42,964 --> 01:04:45,163
La-Loyd, I'm gonna teach you
how to throw.

1465
01:04:58,645 --> 01:04:59,680
Come on!

1466
01:05:03,518 --> 01:05:05,619
- Nya, look alive!
- Thank you.

1467
01:05:09,357 --> 01:05:10,456
Yeah!

1468
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,261
Run for it.

1469
01:05:20,067 --> 01:05:22,233
Lloyd!
Over here, I'm open.

1470
01:05:22,235 --> 01:05:24,401
Okay. All right.
I can do this.

1471
01:05:24,403 --> 01:05:26,605
Quiet your mind, La-Loyd.

1472
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:28,005
Okay.

1473
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,710
Throw like no one's watching
except your judging father.

1474
01:05:30,712 --> 01:05:31,675
Not helping.

1475
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,616
Oh, right.
You got this. Do it.

1476
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:40,987
- Ha! La-Loyd.
- Yes!

1477
01:05:40,989 --> 01:05:42,654
Look at that.
I actually taught you

1478
01:05:42,656 --> 01:05:44,222
- how to do something.
- Right?

1479
01:05:44,224 --> 01:05:46,156
- Nice! Dude, that was awesome!
- You did it, Lloyd!

1480
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:47,424
Cole, catch.

1481
01:05:47,426 --> 01:05:49,395
- Kai.
- Right here, I'm open!

1482
01:05:49,397 --> 01:05:50,561
- Great throw.
- Give me another. Quick!

1483
01:05:50,563 --> 01:05:52,931
Zane, your turn, buddy.

1484
01:05:52,933 --> 01:05:54,032
Whoa!

1485
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:55,733
<i>You've got
a cannon for an arm.</i>

1486
01:05:55,735 --> 01:05:57,304
<i>Seriously,
an awesome throw.</i>

1487
01:06:01,842 --> 01:06:03,775
La-Loyd, something's
happening to my face.

1488
01:06:03,777 --> 01:06:05,878
It's turning upwards
in an unfamiliar motion.

1489
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,545
Oh, I think they've deployed
nerve gas!

1490
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,380
It's happening to you, too!

1491
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,951
Listen, listen. We're smiling!

1492
01:06:11,953 --> 01:06:14,319
What is this "smiling"?

1493
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:16,288
Go with it!
It feels good, right?

1494
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:17,588
It does.

1495
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:19,424
Oh, this whole experience
is so foreign to me.

1496
01:06:19,426 --> 01:06:21,125
- I know, right?
- Yeah!

1497
01:06:21,127 --> 01:06:23,161
All right, here it comes.

1498
01:06:23,163 --> 01:06:24,262
La-Loyd!

1499
01:06:30,705 --> 01:06:32,738
Time to fire you out...

1500
01:06:33,873 --> 01:06:35,005
La-Loyd!

1501
01:06:37,377 --> 01:06:38,677
La-Loyd, are you okay?

1502
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:40,011
Yeah, yeah!
I think it was my arm.

1503
01:06:40,013 --> 01:06:40,913
Is it bad?

1504
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:42,346
- Whoa!
- I don't wanna look!

1505
01:06:42,348 --> 01:06:45,317
It looks okay, I guess.

1506
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:47,184
Scale of one to 10,
how bad is it?

1507
01:06:47,186 --> 01:06:48,587
Oh, I'd say it's about

1508
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:51,290
a seven-point...
Arm-ripped-off.

1509
01:06:51,292 --> 01:06:53,425
My arm is what? What did...
Say it one more time?

1510
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:54,525
Just, don't look down.

1511
01:06:54,527 --> 01:06:55,994
Don't look down
below your neck.

1512
01:06:55,996 --> 01:06:57,561
Don't do that face.
Why are you doing that face?

1513
01:06:57,563 --> 01:07:00,632
It's just a harmless little...

1514
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:02,499
I gotta puke. It's disgusting.

1515
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:03,802
Should I look?

1516
01:07:03,804 --> 01:07:06,603
I looked! I have no arm!
I have no arm! No!

1517
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:07,838
I told you it was bad.

1518
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,541
Ah! That's way worse
than anything

1519
01:07:09,543 --> 01:07:10,909
I could have thought!
That's bad!

1520
01:07:10,911 --> 01:07:12,844
You're gonna be fine.
Let me text your mother.

1521
01:07:12,846 --> 01:07:14,913
Dad, no! I need you!
Stay with me!

1522
01:07:14,915 --> 01:07:17,516
Be here with me right now,
all right? Do something.

1523
01:07:17,518 --> 01:07:19,417
All right, I'm gonna find it.

1524
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,951
What does it look like?

1525
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:24,188
It looks like my left arm,
except it's the right one.

1526
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:25,255
Oh, of course, yes.

1527
01:07:25,257 --> 01:07:26,491
Okay, everybody, fan out,

1528
01:07:26,493 --> 01:07:27,826
form a grid.
Find La-Loyd's arm.

1529
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:29,360
It's got a little hand
like a cup holder

1530
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:32,162
and a black sleeve and
a little piece of green on it.

1531
01:07:32,165 --> 01:07:33,465
You'll know it
when you see it.

1532
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,467
It's La-Loyd's arm,
for heaven's sake.

1533
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:36,867
- Does this look like it?
- No.

1534
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:38,402
All right,
let's try this arm out.

1535
01:07:38,404 --> 01:07:39,672
That's a leg.

1536
01:07:39,674 --> 01:07:41,105
Have you ever had
an arm that kicks?

1537
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:43,474
- I mean, that could be cool.
- Can't say I have.

1538
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,177
Hey, how about this one?

1539
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:47,579
That's a sword.
That's a sword!

1540
01:07:47,581 --> 01:07:49,648
Oh, man, to have a sword arm,
that'd be sweet!

1541
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,583
You know, the idea of it

1542
01:07:51,585 --> 01:07:53,686
is a lot cooler
than the reality.

1543
01:07:53,688 --> 01:07:56,353
Oh, oh, wait...
Wait a minute. Found it!

1544
01:07:56,355 --> 01:07:58,190
- Here we go!
- Okay.

1545
01:07:58,192 --> 01:08:00,492
I'm gonna pop that arm
back into place.

1546
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:01,761
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1547
01:08:01,763 --> 01:08:03,594
But it's only gonna hurt
for a second, right?

1548
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:04,962
Hurt for a second? No!

1549
01:08:04,964 --> 01:08:06,597
This is gonna be agony
for a while.

1550
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:07,800
Who gave you
that misinformation?

1551
01:08:07,802 --> 01:08:09,067
All right, all right,
all right.

1552
01:08:09,069 --> 01:08:10,268
Just do it, just do it,
just do it.

1553
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,637
Okay. On the count of 12...

1554
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:14,340
No, no, no, no.
I don't wanna do 12.

1555
01:08:14,342 --> 01:08:16,507
Let's do... Let's do, like,
a, you know, three.

1556
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:19,044
Okay, three.

1557
01:08:19,046 --> 01:08:20,110
One,

1558
01:08:20,112 --> 01:08:21,545
two...

1559
01:08:21,547 --> 01:08:23,080
Ah! I wish your mom
was here to do this.

1560
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:25,150
You're killing me. You got...
You gotta just do it.

1561
01:08:25,152 --> 01:08:27,251
All right. One,

1562
01:08:27,253 --> 01:08:28,456
two,

1563
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:29,891
three.

1564
01:08:31,257 --> 01:08:32,825
Wow.

1565
01:08:32,827 --> 01:08:34,025
It, uh...

1566
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,660
Feels, uh...

1567
01:08:35,662 --> 01:08:37,128
It feels pretty good.

1568
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:39,932
Feels pretty good.

1569
01:08:39,934 --> 01:08:43,102
You did that,
put my arm back on

1570
01:08:43,104 --> 01:08:45,036
like a real dad.

1571
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,370
You...

1572
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,974
You called me "Dad."

1573
01:08:48,442 --> 01:08:49,506
Yeah.

1574
01:08:49,509 --> 01:08:52,111
Wow! I guess I...
I guess I did.

1575
01:08:52,113 --> 01:08:55,046
I really stepped up there
in kind of a "Dad" way.

1576
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,146
Right?

1577
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:58,549
Lloyd, come on!
We gotta get outta here!

1578
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,517
- Come on!
- Run! Run!

1579
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,020
Guys, we have to go.

1580
01:09:02,022 --> 01:09:04,656
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Come on!

1581
01:09:04,658 --> 01:09:05,990
Let's get moving.

1582
01:09:05,992 --> 01:09:07,512
Come on, everybody, let's go!

1583
01:09:08,662 --> 01:09:09,928
I can't believe
it worked.

1584
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:12,533
Temple, here we come!

1585
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,700
Hey, La-Loyd,

1586
01:09:15,702 --> 01:09:16,901
let me show you
how to fly this thing.

1587
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:19,169
Hands, 10 and two.

1588
01:09:19,172 --> 01:09:21,973
I build and drive mechs
all the time.

1589
01:09:21,975 --> 01:09:23,074
I think I'm good.

1590
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:26,247
Oh. Okay. Yeah,
you're probably right.

1591
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,049
Um... What, uh...

1592
01:09:32,051 --> 01:09:34,718
What were you saying?
10 and...

1593
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,254
- Oh, two! 10 and two.
- Two. Two.

1594
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:37,722
- Yeah, just 10 and two.
- Okay, all right, all right.

1595
01:09:37,724 --> 01:09:38,956
That's kind of a rule of thumb

1596
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:40,159
- in driving.
- That's good to know.

1597
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:41,559
And don't forget
to check your rear-view.

1598
01:09:41,561 --> 01:09:42,761
You wanna see
what's back there.

1599
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:43,661
You have blind spots
everywhere.

1600
01:09:43,663 --> 01:09:44,795
Rear-view, check.

1601
01:09:44,797 --> 01:09:46,031
Keep your eyes peeled.

1602
01:09:46,033 --> 01:09:47,298
You really wanna be
looking ahead.

1603
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,367
Noted, thank you.

1604
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:50,833
You want me to really
open this thing up?

1605
01:09:50,836 --> 01:09:52,871
Sure. Yeah,
let's see what it can do.

1606
01:09:52,873 --> 01:09:54,005
Okay.

1607
01:09:55,242 --> 01:09:56,340
Yeah!

1608
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:01,713
Okay, that's enough!

1609
01:10:01,715 --> 01:10:03,014
- That's too fast.
- You didn't like that?

1610
01:10:03,016 --> 01:10:04,182
I mean, I liked it.
If I was driving,

1611
01:10:04,184 --> 01:10:05,816
- I would be fine with it.
- Sure, sure.

1612
01:10:05,818 --> 01:10:07,585
Right. I felt a little scared.
Were you scared?

1613
01:10:07,587 --> 01:10:09,119
Um, yeah. I'm not gonna lie,

1614
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:10,989
I might need
a change of armor.

1615
01:10:10,991 --> 01:10:12,557
I want you to guard

1616
01:10:12,559 --> 01:10:13,625
the brake a little bit.

1617
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:15,194
Okay, okay, got it, got it.

1618
01:10:15,196 --> 01:10:17,696
You're doing great, buddy,
this is going real... Goat!

1619
01:10:17,698 --> 01:10:20,131
Goat, goat, goat!

1620
01:10:39,519 --> 01:10:40,751
Is everyone okay?

1621
01:10:40,753 --> 01:10:42,187
- Not really.
- Huh?

1622
01:10:43,523 --> 01:10:48,325
Behold, the Temple
of Fragile Foundations.

1623
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,797
The helicopter crash has
destabilized the entire area.

1624
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,099
And I'm not blaming anyone,

1625
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:56,567
but if I ever see
that goat again,

1626
01:10:56,569 --> 01:10:57,870
he and I are gonna have words.

1627
01:10:57,872 --> 01:10:58,937
And you can bet
some of those words

1628
01:10:58,939 --> 01:11:00,169
are gonna have four letters.

1629
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,876
And I'm not talking
about "goat."

1630
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:04,578
Give us the first letter.

1631
01:11:09,382 --> 01:11:12,150
This is my new least
favorite place I've ever been.

1632
01:11:12,152 --> 01:11:15,754
I've spent a lot
of time here, and trust me,

1633
01:11:15,756 --> 01:11:17,388
doesn't get any better.

1634
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:22,061
Wait a minute.
So, you know this place?

1635
01:11:22,063 --> 01:11:23,797
Who doesn't know

1636
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:27,731
their childhood home?

1637
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:31,870
Yeah, this place
is so unstable

1638
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:34,709
I had to move to a volcano
just to feel safe.

1639
01:11:36,175 --> 01:11:38,044
Well, shall we?

1640
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:44,114
Stay close.

1641
01:11:44,116 --> 01:11:45,584
I will lead you
through this perilous...

1642
01:11:45,586 --> 01:11:47,285
Oh, look, a light switch.

1643
01:11:47,287 --> 01:11:48,785
Do you guys have
a bathroom I could use?

1644
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:49,852
Nope.

1645
01:11:49,855 --> 01:11:51,188
Fresh fruit!

1646
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:53,023
- Finally, food!
- I'm starving!

1647
01:11:53,025 --> 01:11:54,593
Ow! I think I chipped a tooth.

1648
01:11:54,595 --> 01:11:56,661
Yeah, my parents were really
into plastic fruit.

1649
01:11:56,663 --> 01:11:58,464
Whoa! Check out
those old photos.

1650
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,598
Look at that!

1651
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,535
<i>Aw! They're so cute!</i>

1652
01:12:03,537 --> 01:12:05,102
<i>Look at his baby goatee!</i>

1653
01:12:05,104 --> 01:12:08,272
<i>I mean, Master Wu
looks like a really old man.</i>

1654
01:12:08,274 --> 01:12:11,375
<i>He even
schooled you back then.</i>

1655
01:12:11,377 --> 01:12:12,910
Whatevz.

1656
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,612
Come on, let's go find
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

1657
01:12:14,614 --> 01:12:15,815
Wait.

1658
01:12:17,516 --> 01:12:19,153
That's... That's you.

1659
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,218
And that's...

1660
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,588
<i>It's Lady Iron Dragon,</i>

1661
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:24,955
my hero!

1662
01:12:24,957 --> 01:12:27,892
Yes, Lady Iron Dragon,

1663
01:12:27,894 --> 01:12:30,896
aka La-Loyd's mom.

1664
01:12:30,898 --> 01:12:32,464
Wait, what?

1665
01:12:32,466 --> 01:12:33,998
Mom was a ninja?

1666
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,531
<i>That's right.</i>

1667
01:12:35,534 --> 01:12:38,402
She was the most awesome
ninja warrior I'd ever seen.

1668
01:12:38,404 --> 01:12:42,106
I remember the first time
I laid eyes on her.

1669
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,976
<i>It was during a raging war.</i>

1670
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,745
<i>I was pillaging
a peaceful village</i>

1671
01:12:46,747 --> 01:12:48,213
<i>with my skeleton army</i>

1672
01:12:48,215 --> 01:12:50,781
<i>when I spotted this beautiful
warrior queen</i>

1673
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:53,151
<i>from across
a crowded battlefield.</i>

1674
01:12:53,153 --> 01:12:56,955
<i>She was fighting for good
and looking great doing it.</i>

1675
01:12:56,957 --> 01:13:00,091
<i>Even as she decimated
my evil forces,</i>

1676
01:13:00,094 --> 01:13:02,761
<i>I couldn't take
my eyes off her.</i>

1677
01:13:02,763 --> 01:13:05,230
<i>I was speechless.</i>

1678
01:13:05,232 --> 01:13:08,432
<i>I summoned all my courage
to approach her.</i>

1679
01:13:08,434 --> 01:13:11,369
<i>I asked her
if she fought here often.</i>

1680
01:13:11,371 --> 01:13:14,374
<i>She said, "I do."</i>

1681
01:13:15,509 --> 01:13:17,241
<i>And let me tell you, La-Loyd.</i>

1682
01:13:17,243 --> 01:13:20,081
<i>When our eyes met,
sparks flew.</i>

1683
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:27,888
<i>It was love at first fight!</i>

1684
01:13:29,256 --> 01:13:32,624
<i>Your mother and I
were a true power couple.</i>

1685
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:36,261
<i>I thought we were gonna
conquer the world together.</i>

1686
01:13:42,434 --> 01:13:46,036
<i>It was the happiest
time of my life.</i>

1687
01:13:46,038 --> 01:13:47,606
<i>Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.</i>

1688
01:13:47,608 --> 01:13:51,345
If you guys were so perfect,
then why did you leave us?

1689
01:13:52,777 --> 01:13:54,147
It's...

1690
01:13:55,282 --> 01:13:56,751
Complicated.

1691
01:13:59,987 --> 01:14:02,456
<i>One day, we came upon NINJAGO.</i>

1692
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:06,490
<i>I told your mother</i>

1693
01:14:06,492 --> 01:14:08,058
<i>that I wanted to build
our son's future</i>

1694
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:11,031
<i>on the ashes
of that fine city.</i>

1695
01:14:13,266 --> 01:14:16,533
<i>But it was at that moment
that your mother realized...</i>

1696
01:14:18,604 --> 01:14:21,207
<i>...that the life
of a conquering warlord...</i>

1697
01:14:24,177 --> 01:14:26,113
<i>...was not the life
she wanted...</i>

1698
01:14:29,983 --> 01:14:31,918
<i>For you.</i>

1699
01:14:34,988 --> 01:14:37,091
I could've changed.

1700
01:15:01,881 --> 01:15:04,150
But I didn't.

1701
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,496
<i>And before I knew it...</i>

1702
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:21,302
<i>She was gone...</i>

1703
01:15:23,768 --> 01:15:25,438
<i>And you were gone.</i>

1704
01:15:42,787 --> 01:15:46,259
La-Loyd,
your mom was the best.

1705
01:15:47,161 --> 01:15:50,128
She expected the best of me

1706
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:52,498
<i>and only ever wanted
the best for you.</i>

1707
01:15:58,872 --> 01:16:01,475
I never should
have let you go.

1708
01:16:03,943 --> 01:16:08,112
<i>Lloyd! We found
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon!</i>

1709
01:16:08,114 --> 01:16:09,347
Here, in the bedroom!

1710
01:16:09,349 --> 01:16:10,682
We think it's in that box.

1711
01:16:10,684 --> 01:16:11,886
Open it, open it, open it!

1712
01:16:13,921 --> 01:16:15,786
<i>Whoa!</i>

1713
01:16:15,788 --> 01:16:17,422
<i>What a bunch of junk.</i>

1714
01:16:17,424 --> 01:16:20,558
Maybe there's something
important under it.

1715
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,794
<i>This is the Ultimate
Ultimate Disappointment.</i>

1716
01:16:22,796 --> 01:16:24,529
- Correct.
- No. Wait.

1717
01:16:24,531 --> 01:16:27,499
There's a piece for each
of our elements.

1718
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:28,903
Fire.

1719
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:32,038
Whoa!

1720
01:16:32,906 --> 01:16:34,705
And earth.

1721
01:16:34,707 --> 01:16:36,374
This rocks!

1722
01:16:36,376 --> 01:16:40,678
- And water.
- H-2, oh yeah!

1723
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,980
And ice.

1724
01:16:41,982 --> 01:16:43,781
Cool.

1725
01:16:43,783 --> 01:16:45,382
<i>And lightning.</i>

1726
01:16:45,384 --> 01:16:46,552
Ah!

1727
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:51,755
And I'm... Green.

1728
01:16:51,757 --> 01:16:54,825
But I'm so happy for you guys.

1729
01:16:54,827 --> 01:16:57,497
Yay.

1730
01:16:59,099 --> 01:17:00,464
You know, La-Loyd,

1731
01:17:00,466 --> 01:17:02,766
after spending
all this time with you,

1732
01:17:02,768 --> 01:17:05,536
seeing the amazing ninja
warrior you've become...

1733
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:06,605
Yeah?

1734
01:17:06,607 --> 01:17:08,373
You know, I've realized

1735
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:10,741
that we don't need
to fight each other

1736
01:17:10,743 --> 01:17:12,775
when we can fight
alongside each other.

1737
01:17:12,777 --> 01:17:13,844
Really?

1738
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:16,013
Yeah.

1739
01:17:16,015 --> 01:17:20,150
La-Loyd, will you go back
to NINJAGO with me

1740
01:17:20,153 --> 01:17:22,754
as father...

1741
01:17:22,756 --> 01:17:25,723
...and General Number One?

1742
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,592
Wait, what? You...

1743
01:17:27,594 --> 01:17:29,660
You're General Number One?

1744
01:17:29,662 --> 01:17:31,427
Exactly!

1745
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:34,766
But... But you just said how
you regretted letting me go.

1746
01:17:34,768 --> 01:17:37,634
Because you'd make the perfect
General Number One.

1747
01:17:37,636 --> 01:17:40,105
We're an amazing team,
La-Loyd.

1748
01:17:40,107 --> 01:17:42,839
You, me,
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

1749
01:17:42,841 --> 01:17:44,308
We'd be unstoppable.

1750
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:47,910
No. I don't wanna be
your General Number One.

1751
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:52,016
But just imagine it.
We can rule NINJAGO, together.

1752
01:17:52,018 --> 01:17:53,651
Come with me, La-Loyd.

1753
01:17:53,653 --> 01:17:56,453
We have so much lost time
to make up for!

1754
01:17:56,455 --> 01:17:58,289
And since I'll no longer
be attacking the city,

1755
01:17:58,291 --> 01:17:59,657
no one will hate you anymore.

1756
01:17:59,659 --> 01:18:01,258
And I'll never forget
your birthday again

1757
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,593
because we'll celebrate
your birthday every day!

1758
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:06,297
And think of all the things
I could teach you.

1759
01:18:06,299 --> 01:18:09,565
Tie a tie, ride a bike,
conquer a city.

1760
01:18:09,568 --> 01:18:11,436
And if we leave now,
we can unleash

1761
01:18:11,438 --> 01:18:13,237
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon
on Meowthra

1762
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:15,307
and conquer NINJAGO together.
Come on!

1763
01:18:15,309 --> 01:18:17,409
Dad, please don't.

1764
01:18:18,644 --> 01:18:21,279
Come back to NINJAGO with me
and save the city.

1765
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:22,879
- What?
- You'll be a hero.

1766
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:24,748
But that's not who I am,
La-Loyd.

1767
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,450
People would never
see me as a hero.

1768
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:29,788
But it doesn't
have to be this way.

1769
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:32,423
This is your chance
to make a change.

1770
01:18:32,425 --> 01:18:34,593
I didn't want it to be
this way either,

1771
01:18:34,595 --> 01:18:35,859
but here we are.

1772
01:18:35,862 --> 01:18:38,795
Dad, please, don't go.

1773
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:41,230
If I couldn't change then,

1774
01:18:41,233 --> 01:18:44,001
what makes you think
I could change now?

1775
01:18:44,003 --> 01:18:45,203
No, no.

1776
01:18:45,205 --> 01:18:46,469
- Stop!
- No, no, no!

1777
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:48,138
- Back off!
- No way!

1778
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:50,107
Hey, that's my sister!

1779
01:18:50,109 --> 01:18:52,175
- Get off my face!
- Bam!

1780
01:18:52,177 --> 01:18:53,878
- I got it!
- Give that back!

1781
01:18:55,448 --> 01:18:57,648
I can help you.
We can do it together.

1782
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:00,218
If you just give me the box,
we can talk about it.

1783
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:03,120
I can't.
You'll just leave.

1784
01:19:03,122 --> 01:19:04,923
- I got it!
- Look out!

1785
01:19:04,925 --> 01:19:07,258
- Cole!
- Gotcha! Nice try.

1786
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,861
We're like
the Harlem Globetrotters.

1787
01:19:09,863 --> 01:19:11,361
Hey!

1788
01:19:11,363 --> 01:19:12,931
- Over here, over here!
- Get outta my way.

1789
01:19:12,933 --> 01:19:14,163
Lloyd, catch it!

1790
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,833
<i>- Run, Lloyd! Run!</i>
- I got it!

1791
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:17,302
I got it! I got it!

1792
01:19:17,304 --> 01:19:18,870
<i>Predictable but regrettable.</i>

1793
01:19:18,872 --> 01:19:20,070
Bummer.

1794
01:19:20,072 --> 01:19:22,342
Oh, La-Loyd.

1795
01:19:23,976 --> 01:19:25,179
Dad.

1796
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,147
I should have taught you
how to catch.

1797
01:19:29,149 --> 01:19:31,185
No!

1798
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:45,364
So long, La-Loyd.

1799
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,375
Get outta the way! This whole
thing is coming down!

1800
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,378
We don't have those pieces.

1801
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,245
Yeah, and we don't
even have our mechs.

1802
01:20:02,247 --> 01:20:03,781
We're doomed!

1803
01:20:03,783 --> 01:20:05,349
- Oh, no! We're gonna die.
- What do we do?

1804
01:20:05,351 --> 01:20:09,352
<i>Our chances
of survival are 0.00...</i>

1805
01:20:09,354 --> 01:20:12,758
Stay on the right path
to find your inner peace.

1806
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,195
Did he say inner peace?

1807
01:20:19,533 --> 01:20:22,365
<i>The power is inside you.</i>

1808
01:20:22,367 --> 01:20:25,236
<i>The power is inside you.</i>

1809
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:27,773
<i>The power is inside you.</i>

1810
01:20:34,281 --> 01:20:35,612
Inner peace?

1811
01:20:35,614 --> 01:20:38,115
<i>Find your inner peace.</i>

1812
01:20:38,117 --> 01:20:39,651
Inner peace! Inner piece!

1813
01:20:39,653 --> 01:20:41,951
Guys. Guys, we don't
need those pieces.

1814
01:20:41,953 --> 01:20:45,755
The Ultimate Ultimate Weapon
is inside of you.

1815
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:49,326
- What?
- Yes, you have the power.

1816
01:20:49,328 --> 01:20:50,895
<i>Look within.</i>

1817
01:20:50,897 --> 01:20:54,130
Harness what you already have
inside and let it out.

1818
01:20:54,132 --> 01:20:56,601
I believe in each of you.

1819
01:20:56,603 --> 01:20:59,571
Nya, you can create water.

1820
01:20:59,573 --> 01:21:01,805
Kai, you can make fire.

1821
01:21:01,808 --> 01:21:03,673
Okay. All right.
I can make a fire.

1822
01:21:03,675 --> 01:21:06,710
The power is inside
of all of you.

1823
01:21:06,712 --> 01:21:08,978
Now, calm your mind.
Concentrate.

1824
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,348
Build up your powers.

1825
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:15,352
Just think about earth,
fire, water, ice.

1826
01:21:15,354 --> 01:21:18,388
And you, Jay, lightning, baby.
Do it!

1827
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,124
Jay, you got the power!

1828
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:22,526
Say, "I've got the power!"

1829
01:21:22,528 --> 01:21:25,263
I've got the power!

1830
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:31,370
I've got the power.

1831
01:21:32,573 --> 01:21:34,908
Good work, Cole.
Go, go, go!

1832
01:21:36,376 --> 01:21:37,508
I've got the power.

1833
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:38,744
I too, have the power.

1834
01:21:40,779 --> 01:21:42,549
Here we go.
Come on, hurry up.

1835
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:45,148
What now?

1836
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,482
- Kai, your turn.
- Got it.

1837
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:47,753
I've got the power!

1838
01:21:49,823 --> 01:21:51,692
I think I made it worse!

1839
01:21:52,757 --> 01:21:54,290
<i>Jump, Lloyd. Jump.</i>

1840
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:56,160
Master Wu?

1841
01:21:56,162 --> 01:21:58,463
Guys, I can hear the dead,

1842
01:21:58,465 --> 01:22:02,433
and Master Wu says to jump!

1843
01:22:09,074 --> 01:22:10,441
<i>Great jump, students.</i>

1844
01:22:10,443 --> 01:22:12,477
Master Wu!

1845
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:13,611
You're alive!

1846
01:22:13,613 --> 01:22:16,080
Of course.
I'm a ninja master

1847
01:22:16,082 --> 01:22:17,581
who lives life on the edge

1848
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:19,282
and cheats death
at every turn.

1849
01:22:19,284 --> 01:22:21,251
- Wow!
- Really?

1850
01:22:21,253 --> 01:22:23,254
No. I thought being dead

1851
01:22:23,256 --> 01:22:24,856
would make you listen
to me more.

1852
01:22:24,858 --> 01:22:26,023
And I was right.

1853
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:28,158
Master Wu, we found
our elemental powers.

1854
01:22:28,161 --> 01:22:30,426
All because Lloyd wouldn't
give up on our training.

1855
01:22:30,428 --> 01:22:31,928
Lloyd saved us.

1856
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:34,665
He also decoded your
needlessly cryptic metaphors.

1857
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:36,968
Lloyd, I'm so proud of you.

1858
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:39,102
You helped your friends
be great.

1859
01:22:39,104 --> 01:22:42,740
And that makes you
truly a ninja master.

1860
01:22:42,742 --> 01:22:46,576
Now, let's go save the city
from the giant kitty.

1861
01:22:46,578 --> 01:22:48,748
I second that!

1862
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:52,883
This cat
is destroying everything!

1863
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,852
Where are the Ninjas
when we need them?

1864
01:22:54,854 --> 01:22:56,890
We have to evacuate!

1865
01:22:58,491 --> 01:22:59,656
Run! Run!

1866
01:22:59,658 --> 01:23:01,492
Hey, NINJAGO,

1867
01:23:01,494 --> 01:23:03,026
Garmadon's back!

1868
01:23:03,028 --> 01:23:06,829
Generals, stop anyone
that gets in my way.

1869
01:23:06,832 --> 01:23:08,066
Yes, sir.

1870
01:23:09,903 --> 01:23:11,636
<i>Whoa,
it's the Destiny's Bounty.</i>

1871
01:23:11,638 --> 01:23:13,036
<i>I've always wanted
to shoot at it.</i>

1872
01:23:13,038 --> 01:23:14,272
Attack!

1873
01:23:14,274 --> 01:23:15,976
<i>Alpha team, on it.</i>

1874
01:23:17,176 --> 01:23:19,545
We have company.
Hold on tight.

1875
01:23:23,815 --> 01:23:26,482
<i>Hey, where'd they go?</i>

1876
01:23:26,484 --> 01:23:28,387
All right, Ninjas,
follow me.

1877
01:23:31,957 --> 01:23:33,523
Ninja, go!

1878
01:23:33,525 --> 01:23:34,994
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1879
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,863
Nya, we need to get
to Garmadon and that cat fast.

1880
01:23:39,866 --> 01:23:40,934
You got it.

1881
01:23:44,134 --> 01:23:45,803
All right, you beast.

1882
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:49,574
Get ready to feel the wrath of
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

1883
01:23:49,576 --> 01:23:50,708
Hmm?

1884
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,241
Here they come.

1885
01:23:52,244 --> 01:23:53,544
Come on! Let's go!

1886
01:23:53,546 --> 01:23:54,748
Follow Nya.

1887
01:24:00,753 --> 01:24:02,922
Take that.

1888
01:24:03,724 --> 01:24:04,725
What?

1889
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:10,564
- Zane, freeze these guys out.
- Copy.

1890
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,231
Kai, make a smoke screen.

1891
01:24:14,233 --> 01:24:16,801
Yeah, baby! <i>Fu-fu-fuego!</i>

1892
01:24:18,872 --> 01:24:20,138
Where'd they go?

1893
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,972
I can't see them anywhere.

1894
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:25,011
Okay. Well, how about this?
Hyah!

1895
01:24:25,845 --> 01:24:27,111
These things aren't working.

1896
01:24:27,113 --> 01:24:28,913
Jay, now's your chance, buddy.

1897
01:24:28,915 --> 01:24:29,981
Roger that.

1898
01:24:39,425 --> 01:24:40,760
Let's rock!

1899
01:24:46,466 --> 01:24:48,499
Hey, cat, back off!

1900
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:49,933
I'm Garmadon, baby.

1901
01:24:49,935 --> 01:24:51,268
I'm the greatest
warlord of all...

1902
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:53,736
Somebody help me!

1903
01:24:53,738 --> 01:24:55,741
- Dad?
- Please!

1904
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:58,709
Go, ninjas, go!

1905
01:24:58,711 --> 01:25:00,044
Hip hip hooray!

1906
01:25:00,046 --> 01:25:01,612
The cat ate Garmadon!

1907
01:25:01,614 --> 01:25:03,547
Now all we have to do
is take out the cat

1908
01:25:03,549 --> 01:25:04,949
and NINJAGO is saved.

1909
01:25:04,951 --> 01:25:06,817
- Get him!
- Take out that monster!

1910
01:25:06,819 --> 01:25:09,420
Blast that cat
with your awesome hand powers.

1911
01:25:09,422 --> 01:25:13,624
La-Loyd! Please help me!

1912
01:25:13,626 --> 01:25:16,361
Oh, I can use my fire.
But is that too much?

1913
01:25:16,363 --> 01:25:17,995
Or I could blast him
with my water.

1914
01:25:17,997 --> 01:25:20,129
Cats hate water.

1915
01:25:20,131 --> 01:25:21,635
You were right, Master Wu.

1916
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:24,968
I need to walk the path

1917
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:27,205
that only the son of Garmadon
can walk.

1918
01:25:32,244 --> 01:25:34,044
Oh, my gosh!

1919
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:37,414
The Green Ninja
is Lloyd Garmadon?

1920
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:38,982
Lloyd.

1921
01:25:38,984 --> 01:25:42,320
All we have to do is scare off
Meowthra and we've won.

1922
01:25:42,322 --> 01:25:45,022
- No.
- What?

1923
01:25:45,024 --> 01:25:46,155
Uh, Lloyd,

1924
01:25:46,157 --> 01:25:47,825
where are you going?

1925
01:25:48,728 --> 01:25:50,594
Lloyd? Come back.

1926
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:56,133
Here, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

1927
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:03,374
Yeah, come here.

1928
01:26:03,376 --> 01:26:04,474
Lloyd, no!

1929
01:26:04,476 --> 01:26:06,909
It's okay. He's got this.

1930
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:09,847
<i>That's a good kitty.</i>

1931
01:26:09,849 --> 01:26:13,953
You're okay.
Yeah, you're okay.

1932
01:26:19,158 --> 01:26:22,593
Yeah, yeah,
that's a good kitty.

1933
01:26:22,595 --> 01:26:25,866
What a sweet, sweet kitty.

1934
01:26:27,567 --> 01:26:31,037
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

1935
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,737
Hey. I know it.

1936
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:37,610
I know it. You don't mean
to destroy everything.

1937
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:43,917
<i>When, uh...
When people look at you,</i>

1938
01:26:44,649 --> 01:26:46,816
they see a monster.

1939
01:26:50,089 --> 01:26:52,388
But I know that

1940
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:56,762
you just feel
scared and alone.

1941
01:26:59,698 --> 01:27:02,133
<i>I know how that feels.</i>

1942
01:27:04,603 --> 01:27:06,605
To be judged unfairly.

1943
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:20,753
So, um... I just wanna say
that I forgive you.

1944
01:27:23,522 --> 01:27:24,890
<i>And...</i>

1945
01:27:30,296 --> 01:27:31,731
I'm sorry.

1946
01:27:33,232 --> 01:27:36,569
When I said "I wish
you weren't my father,"

1947
01:27:38,304 --> 01:27:40,206
I didn't really mean it.

1948
01:27:43,376 --> 01:27:46,075
<i>What I...
What I should've said is</i>

1949
01:27:46,077 --> 01:27:52,482
I wish we didn't
fight all of the time.

1950
01:27:52,484 --> 01:27:57,656
<i>I wish I could've
spent more time with you.</i>

1951
01:27:58,757 --> 01:28:00,790
<i>And that you could've seen,</i>

1952
01:28:00,792 --> 01:28:03,427
<i>like, everything
I've been through,</i>

1953
01:28:03,429 --> 01:28:05,062
<i>but you weren't there.</i>

1954
01:28:05,064 --> 01:28:09,333
<i>I wish we could get
that time back, and...</i>

1955
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:15,875
I need my dad.
I just... I need my dad.

1956
01:28:27,418 --> 01:28:28,686
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

1957
01:28:28,688 --> 01:28:30,321
Dad!

1958
01:28:30,323 --> 01:28:32,822
- Are... Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1959
01:28:32,824 --> 01:28:34,193
You're alive!

1960
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,393
Son?

1961
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:37,628
Yeah?

1962
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:41,400
Did you mean
all that stuff you said?

1963
01:28:42,268 --> 01:28:43,766
To the cat?

1964
01:28:43,768 --> 01:28:46,370
Every word.

1965
01:28:46,372 --> 01:28:49,005
Well, I know for a fact

1966
01:28:49,007 --> 01:28:52,476
that the cat feels exactly
the same way.

1967
01:28:53,878 --> 01:28:57,414
Dad? Are you crying?

1968
01:28:57,416 --> 01:28:59,115
No!

1969
01:28:59,117 --> 01:29:03,388
It's just that
I'm kind of allergic to cats.

1970
01:29:08,327 --> 01:29:09,660
- Lloyd!
- Mom!

1971
01:29:09,662 --> 01:29:12,062
Let me look at you. Let me
look at you. Are you hurt?

1972
01:29:12,064 --> 01:29:13,664
Let me see
your fingers and toes.

1973
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:16,901
Okay. You still don't have
fingers and toes. That's good.

1974
01:29:16,903 --> 01:29:18,669
- Is everything okay?
- I'm... I'm fine. I'm good.

1975
01:29:18,671 --> 01:29:20,603
Lloyd, I was
so worried about you.

1976
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,074
Mom. Mom, wait!

1977
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:24,473
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.

1978
01:29:24,475 --> 01:29:25,642
It's okay. I'm just...

1979
01:29:25,644 --> 01:29:27,143
I'm just so happy
you're all right.

1980
01:29:27,145 --> 01:29:30,848
No. Mom, I'm really sorry.

1981
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:33,650
I took you for granted.

1982
01:29:33,652 --> 01:29:35,989
All you ever did
was support me.

1983
01:29:36,555 --> 01:29:38,187
The real me.

1984
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:42,026
The person I am on the inside.

1985
01:29:42,028 --> 01:29:43,026
Oh.

1986
01:29:43,028 --> 01:29:44,594
I'm really sorry, Mom.

1987
01:29:44,596 --> 01:29:46,730
I love you so much.

1988
01:29:46,732 --> 01:29:48,400
I love you, too.

1989
01:29:49,702 --> 01:29:51,535
Bring it in.
Let's hug this out.

1990
01:29:51,537 --> 01:29:53,870
Okay. That's cool. Uh...

1991
01:29:53,872 --> 01:29:56,107
I found two people
to hug me over here.

1992
01:29:57,844 --> 01:29:59,309
Uncle Wu,

1993
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:02,647
I know why you wanted me
to be the Green Ninja.

1994
01:30:02,649 --> 01:30:04,248
Oh, you do?

1995
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,452
Yeah.

1996
01:30:06,519 --> 01:30:08,754
<i>Green is the color of life.</i>

1997
01:30:09,855 --> 01:30:12,224
<i>It flows through
all living things,</i>

1998
01:30:13,058 --> 01:30:15,258
<i>connecting them all.</i>

1999
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:17,263
<i>The way I connect the Ninjas.</i>

2000
01:30:22,101 --> 01:30:23,334
Hi!

2001
01:30:25,904 --> 01:30:30,040
<i>Or the way I connect
my family,</i>

2002
01:30:30,042 --> 01:30:33,376
<i>whether we're together or not.</i>

2003
01:30:33,378 --> 01:30:36,446
Some powers are ones
you cannot see,

2004
01:30:36,448 --> 01:30:40,886
but those are the most
important powers of all.

2005
01:30:43,889 --> 01:30:45,723
Lloyd was a hero.

2006
01:30:45,725 --> 01:30:46,956
Who are you talking to?

2007
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:50,026
He saved Garmadon
and he saved his family.

2008
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:51,195
We're standing right here.

2009
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:53,030
And the whole city of NINJAGO.

2010
01:30:53,032 --> 01:30:54,298
Where are you going?

2011
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,965
They even made Meowthra
the mascot.

2012
01:30:55,967 --> 01:30:58,000
She's so fluffy!
I love her.

2013
01:30:58,002 --> 01:30:59,402
Wu, come back!

2014
01:30:59,404 --> 01:31:01,839
<i>Koko and Nya
opened a school</i>

2015
01:31:01,841 --> 01:31:05,540
<i>to teach former shark generals
life skills.</i>

2016
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:09,480
<i>And Garmadon taught Lloyd
something very important.</i>

2017
01:31:09,482 --> 01:31:10,681
Hey, catch!

2018
01:31:12,351 --> 01:31:14,383
Whoa.

2019
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:17,021
<i>And Lloyd taught everyone</i>

2020
01:31:17,023 --> 01:31:19,156
that even if you're different,

2021
01:31:19,158 --> 01:31:21,592
you can still do great things.

2022
01:31:21,594 --> 01:31:22,692
Whoa!

2023
01:31:22,694 --> 01:31:24,560
So does that mean
I'm a ninja now?

2024
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,129
No.

2025
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:28,633
All you did
was listen to a story.

2026
01:31:28,635 --> 01:31:29,967
Doesn't make you
a martial artist.

2027
01:31:29,969 --> 01:31:31,566
Or does it?

2028
01:31:36,007 --> 01:31:37,409
Okay, okay, okay.

2029
01:31:38,543 --> 01:31:41,145
Listen, to be a master,

2030
01:31:41,147 --> 01:31:44,447
it takes patience,
hard work,

2031
01:31:44,449 --> 01:31:47,587
courage, and...

2032
01:31:50,555 --> 01:31:52,225
Whoa.

2033
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,328
Good.

2034
01:31:58,797 --> 01:32:00,630
Your training begins at dawn.

2035
01:32:00,632 --> 01:32:01,932
Whoa.

2036
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:03,666
Whoa.

2037
01:32:03,668 --> 01:32:05,669
Can we bring the cat?

2038
01:32:05,671 --> 01:32:06,736
No.

2039
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,281
Okay, kids.

2040
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,784
There's one last thing
I have to teach you ninjas.

2041
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:22,885
Get on your feet. You ready?

2042
01:32:22,888 --> 01:32:25,856
Here comes the Dance of Doom.

2043
01:35:19,931 --> 01:35:21,164
A mark.

2044
01:35:21,166 --> 01:35:22,231
<i>Jackie Chan!</i>

2045
01:35:22,234 --> 01:35:23,568
