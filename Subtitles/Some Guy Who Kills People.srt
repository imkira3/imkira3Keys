1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,100
You like making us look stupid, don't you?

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,000
You didn't think we'd see this, huh, Boyd?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
You like to make people laugh, Boyd?

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
See? Now that's funny.

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,900
Wake up, Neo...

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,600
Late again.

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,900
I know. I...

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,300
- Is he pissed?
- He's not thrilled.

11
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,300
- Here you go, sheriff. The usual.
- Thanks, Al.

12
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,800
That looks good. I will take a scoop of
chocolate with some sprinkles, please.

13
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,200
Now, easy there, Hopalong. We're still on duty.
Just get him a sorbet.

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,500
Right away. Keep on keeping our town safe now.

15
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,400
Well, hello there, tardy two-shoes.

16
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,300
When everyone told me not to hire the guy
fresh out of the loony bin, I ignored them.

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,700
I appreciate that, sir.

18
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,600
- Don't make me look like an idiot, Boyd.
- Yes, sir, I am sorry.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,200
You know if you would just set an alarm,
you wouldn't have to eat that asshole's shit.

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,700
- Not as good as when you make 'em, Kenny.
- Thanks, sheriff.

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,800
- What do you say, Irv?
- Just living the dream, sheriff, living the dream.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,100
Oh, by the way, I am heading by your
mom's place later on for some exotic oils.

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,800
I might just start smelling like eucalyptus.

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,700
Boyd. Grab your party outfit and get out of here.
I got you working a birthday.

25
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,100
Somebody's big day, huh?

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,900
Yeah, Marty Prichard's turning 34.
Huge news. Whole world's celebrating.

27
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,900
- Marty Prichard?
- Yeah.

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,100
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,400
Let's get a move on then.

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,000
- Can I have some ice cream, please?
- Yes, you may.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,200
- Enjoy your delicious scoop.
- Thank you.

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,700
I don't think he got the message.
What do you guys think?

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
Hello?

34
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

35
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,900
What do you recommend?

36
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,800
The "Chocolate Bananaza" is really good.

37
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,700
Bananaza?

38
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,400
Like Bonanza but Banana... Za.

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,700
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

40
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,100
Well, this particular flavor is gluten-free.

41
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,900
But may contain a trace amount of nuts.

42
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,100
If you're allergic to nuts,
I'd recommend staying away from it.

43
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,500
- Not allergic to nuts, no.
- Then it might be right up your alley.

44
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Unless you'd like to try "Rum Raisin the Roof".

45
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,000
- I'll just give you a scoop of both.
- Okay.

46
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,200
Thank you. Thank you very much.

47
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,800
- Ken.
- Okay. Stephanie.

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,700
- Thank you.
- Stephanie.

49
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,200
Kenny Boyd! How're you doing, buddy?

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,600
It's good to see you moving up in the world.

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,900
Look at yourself.

52
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,500
- Kenny Boyd.
- Hey sweetie.

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,100
- Did you see Kenny Boyd?
- Hi, Kenny.

54
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,900
This is great, baby.

55
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,200
This is a great party. Thank you. Come on.

56
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,400
Kenny Boyd.

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Get away from me!

58
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,300
Do you have any aspirin?
I have a splitting headache.

59
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,500
I always carry aspirin,
so you don't need to "ax"(ask).

60
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,600
Well, this was no accident.

61
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,700
Well, this guy's going to heaven,
and he's got an all-"ax"cess pass.

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,900
It's the "ax".

63
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,800
What are you doing?

64
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,100
I thought we were doing puns.

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,800
- No, why would we be doing puns?
- I felt like you were doing puns with...

66
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,600
This guy's got a hatchet in his head.

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Then he was dumped in his backyard
after his birthday party?

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,100
No, our guy knew his victim.

69
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,400
Knew him and hated him.

70
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,300
Why would someone douse a body
in gasoline and not burn it?

71
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,000
So we'd find it.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,100
The coroner found these two
cards stuffed in his mouth.

73
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,300
What do you think, chief?

74
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,700
 I got nothing.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,100
This looks like something
my ex-wife would have done.

76
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,500
Good pun.

77
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,600
How was your day?

78
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,000
- Just fine.
- Fine.

79
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,900
34 years, and all I ever get is "fine".

80
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,300
Not now, ma.

81
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,600
Ah, yes. The other thing you say
when someone pulls your string.

82
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,500
"Fine"... "Not now"...

83
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,600
"Fine"... "Not now"...

84
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Marty... had his vices.

85
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,600
But he wasn't a gambler.

86
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,100
- At least not that I know of.
- Never owed anyone money?

87
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,100
- I don't think so.
- Well, that must be nice.

88
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,500
Well, it's...
not something I like to talk about, but,

89
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,700
Marty did spend a lot of time with other women.

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,800
When he went missing the
night of his birthday party,

91
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,600
I assumed he was off with some new hussy.

92
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Hussies?

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,500
This guy. Really?

94
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,600
- Can I be honest, sheriff?
- Of course you can.

95
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,100
I didn't kill Marty.

96
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,300
But I am not upset that he's dead.

97
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,400
Does that make me a bad person?

98
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,900
No, no. Of course not.

99
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,500
Hey, Boyd! Hey, Boyd!
You moving into your new house?

100
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,600
Say, shouldn't you be in a padded room somewhere?
In your own shit?

101
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,600
You like making us look stupid, don't you?

102
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,300
No?

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,900
Seems a lot like you do.

104
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,300
I'll tell you what.

105
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,100
I'm going to make you look stupid.
How about that?

106
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,600
Hold that bitch. Hold him.

107
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
Ooh, he's shaking. He's scared, man.

108
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,600
Keep him still, bro. You like that, motherfucker?

109
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,000
Boyd!

110
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,000
Boyd! You're on street duty.

111
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,800
And for the last time, cover those up, will ya?
They're disgusting.

112
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,000
What?

113
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,400
He's right. They're not pretty.

114
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,900
*** Subtitles manually transcribed by Subtopian ***

115
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,100
Heads up, minty.

116
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,900
- Aww, thanks.
- No problem. You all right?

117
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Um, I, you know, my back, just...

118
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,800
- Thank you so much.
- It's cool.

119
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,500
- See you later.
- See ya.

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,900
You didn't have a problem with me playing
basketball before Ronald came along.

121
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,300
Well, honey,
that's because Ronald has opened my eyes,

122
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,000
to many of the mistakes and imperfections
of the life you and I are leading.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,200
He and I now believe that the time you spent
on sporting events can now be spent with us,

124
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,700
at bible study.

125
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,900
Shall we? Jesus frowns on tardiness.

126
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,300
Guess he's okay with bad sweaters.

127
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,500
Lord, please send someone to aid this precious
child and steer her down a righteous path. Amen.

128
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,700
Amen.

129
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,500
- I do not like the tone in her voice lately.
- I will talk to her, honey.

130
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,000
I hope whoever he sends bring pizza,
cuz I am starving.

131
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,500
That's right. Don't let anybody see anything.

132
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Keep it all to yourself.

133
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,000
I was gonna get that.

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,800
And come out of your little cocoon?

135
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,800
What kind of a mother would I be
if I let you do a thing like that?

136
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,500
The doctor said 7 out of 10
people try suicide again.

137
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,700
You want to off yourself?

138
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,800
Then you have to earn it.

139
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,600
Shit!

140
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,600
See you later.

141
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,300
I just thought Tammy's dress was very
inappropriate. Well, it's a church.

142
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,900
I thought you told me the music box was from you.

143
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,400
- Amy, honey, you scared us.
- My music box.

144
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,500
There is an engraving on the bottom.

145
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,600
"LOVE DAD". I guess you didn't know that.

146
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,900
Why don't I, uh, make us some chamomile, okay?

147
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,200
When I met him, he'd been in a hospital,

148
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,600
for depression or something.

149
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,300
He was just a mistake in my life
that I decided to put behind me.

150
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,800
But you didn't consider what I might want.

151
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,300
It was for the best. He's a troubled person.

152
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
11 years, mom.

153
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,200
I've spent 11 years thinking
my dad just disappeared.

154
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
- I understand you're upset.
- You think?

155
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,900
Do you know where he is?

156
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,000
How's the Lord feel about lying, mom?
Where's your stand on that?

157
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,900
I think he lives in Green Oaks.

158
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
What's his name?

159
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,400
- Amy, please.
- What's my dad's name?

160
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,900
Hey, motherfucker. You owe me a hundy.

161
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,800
Cuz you said I couldn't drive out here
meth-ed out of my motherfucking mind.

162
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,200
Well, guess what, faggot? I just did.

163
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,600
Hey. Shut up. Shut up. I gotta bounce.

164
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Just have my money ready.

165
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,000
Bitch.

166
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:04,100
Hey! I hope your ass is a whole lot better
than this shit what I've been smoking, man.

167
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,000
What the fuck, bro?

168
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,600
What the fuck?

169
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,200
I didn't come here to watch no movie.

170
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,600
- What do you got for me, Ernie?
- Another body, sir.

171
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,300
- Wade Hutchinson.
- Got me a box?

172
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,700
- What? I mean, no, I just got the...
- Attaboy.

173
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
- Any witnesses?
- No, sir.

174
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,100
The manager just showed up. He said the projection
booth was broken into but nothing's missing.

175
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,000
There's nothing missing off of Wade either,
and he had over 200 bucks on him.

176
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
- This one has no head, Ernie.
- I know, sir.

177
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,300
- Most bodies have heads.
- Absolutely.

178
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,700
Where's this one's head?

179
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
- Not sure yet, sir.
- Oh, we should find this head.

180
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,100
Good idea, sir.

181
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,600
You don't just cut off a man's head
unless you're one angry fella.

182
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,900
- Found the head, sir.
- Bring it on over.

183
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,300
See? Now that's funny.

184
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,800
You got what you deserved.

185
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Deputy Dobkins?

186
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,700
Sheriff, reporter from the Gazette's on line 1.

187
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,100
Hey, there.

188
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,900
- Still no press, sir?
- You heard the mayor. No press, no panic.

189
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,700
We're gonna find the bastard, Ernie.
We're gonna find him.

190
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,600
We're gonna tear his skin off.

191
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Make him wear his own skin.

192
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,100
Found a second body the other day.

193
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,000
- Really?
- Yeah, indeedy.

194
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,200
Did you know Wade Hutchinson?

195
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
You went to school together, didn't you?

196
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,700
He says, "Yes."

197
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,900
Well, somebody did ol' Wade in good.

198
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,900
"Decapitato".

199
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,000
Big ol' messy mess.

200
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,300
But you gotta do me a favor, you gotta keep this on
the DL because anything this grisly gets let out,

201
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,100
we're gonna have a shitstorm on our hands.

202
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,500
Sure thing, sheriff.

203
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,300
I'm done.

204
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,400
Good kid. Not gonna win any Christmas contest,
but good kid.

205
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,900
Well, he got him with one bold stroke.

206
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,500
Clean off. Machete?

207
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,900
I don't know, maybe a samurai sword?

208
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,700
That'll be cool.

209
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,300
It's like his eyes follow you.

210
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,800
I think, uh...

211
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,700
you may also be interested in this.

212
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Why does he have a "tepee" carved into his chest?

213
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,800
Tepee?

214
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,200
I'm thinking it's a "V".

215
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,300
- Why do you let Fooger push you around?
- I like this job.I don't wanna cause any problems.

216
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,100
Don't you see that is the
fucking problem right there?

217
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,100
I used to look forward to taking out the trash.

218
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,000
- Yeah, right.
- In the loony bin.

219
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,800
We used to have to...
We used to have to take the trash out...

220
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,000
to the loading dock, and there was this mural...

221
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,300
of a jungle...

222
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,600
that was drawn by some patients a long time ago.

223
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,400
It's hidden behind the dumpster.

224
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,600
Hardly anybody knew it was there.

225
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,100
But if you moved the dumpster just a little bit.

226
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,500
And because the sun never touched it,
it was still this...

227
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,100
beautiful burst of color.

228
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,300
So a finger painting done by a bunch of
schizophrenics. Is that what got you going?

229
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,600
That hospital turned you into a zombie, Ken.

230
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,400
You had no business even being there.

231
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,500
Especially with all the people running around
this world with the freedom they don't deserve.

232
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
C'mon, man, it's a fucking joke.

233
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,500
All right, let's get the fuck outta here.
You checked the till?

234
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,000
Checked the till. Yeah. I... yup... I...

235
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,100
I scrubbed the sink. I washed the scoopers.

236
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,200
Forgot to lock the door.

237
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,300
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

238
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,900
Sorry, we're closed.
He just forgot to lock the door.

239
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,300
Want me to get anything for you?

240
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,700
Okay, well then, we're closed.

241
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,800
I just want to say thanks for the music box.

242
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,700
My mom told me you gave it to me.

243
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,500
But she didn't want me to know,
because she didn't want me to know about you.

244
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,300
Amy?

245
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,600
Yeah.

246
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,200
So... I guess I'm just saying thanks.

247
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,800
You're welcome.

248
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,300
Yeah.

249
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,200
I guess... Have a good night.

250
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,400
- Yeah, you too.
- Thanks.

251
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,400
You're a really good ice cream cone.

252
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,900
You have a fucking daughter.

253
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,700
Yeah.

254
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,000
- How old is she?
- 11.

255
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,800
And who's the mama?

256
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,900
Janet Wheeler.

257
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,600
That girl you used to...
used to date for like a week?

258
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,100
You got her pregnant?

259
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,500
I found out after she dumped me.

260
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,900
When I heard, I tracked her down to Clifton.

261
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,500
I took all the money I had and bought an
engagement ring. It was the right thing to do.

262
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,900
So I proposed to her.

263
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,900
She didn't want anything to do with me. She said
it was better if... Pretend I just didn't exist.

264
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,100
Couldn't really argue.

265
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,100
So that's when you...

266
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,100
Hi, dad.

267
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,800
Oh, right. I knew there was something.

268
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,500
- Your daughter is here.
- Yes. I noticed.

269
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,000
She showed up about an hour ago,
so I already went through the whole...

270
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,400
- being surprised thing.
- You just let her walk in here?

271
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,200
I made her tackle a series
of obstacles but she passed.

272
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,100
Were you ever gonna tell me about this?

273
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,500
- I don't want to get into this, ma.
- Seems a little late for that.

274
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,400
Now, go in there and say, "Hello",

275
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,900
like a normal human being.

276
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,400
I don't know anything about her.

277
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,300
She's 11, talkative, unlike yourself,

278
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,700
and she tears your batch of banana
bread like a little gremlin.

279
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,900
She can't stay here.

280
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,000
She's staying,

281
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,300
but you could leave.

282
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,200
Turn around. Turn around.

283
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,900
- Go! Go! Can you say, "Hello?" "Hello."
- I don't...

284
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,300
Just say, "Hello." "Hello." Can you say, "Hello?"

285
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,700
Hello, she's your daughter.

286
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,800
That's my boy.

287
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,900
- So she just showed up at your house?
- Yeah.

288
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,700
That's great, Ken.

289
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,200
It's not great.
I don't know... I've no idea what to do.

290
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,600
Get your fucking life back on track.

291
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,700
All right.
You're 34 and you work in an ice cream parlor.

292
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
You work in an ice cream parlor.

293
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,500
Yeah, but I'm a fucking loser, Ken. All right.

294
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
But you? You once had spirit, ambition.

295
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,400
- You're not a loser.
- Man, I wish you weren't so fucking wrong.

296
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,900
You know, when you were gone.
I tried to do a couple of different things.

297
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,300
I was a newspaper delivery guy, a garbageman.

298
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,700
I even removed snow.

299
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,700
Shit, I even tried to be a cop.

300
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,100
But the sheriff,
he pretty much laughed in my face.

301
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,100
- You wanted be a cop?
- Look, whatever.

302
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,900
That's not the point.

303
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,900
The point is, that girl, she's your daughter.

304
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,200
You have a right to be with her.

305
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,500
Yeah, but it's just not a good time right now.

306
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,600
C'mon, man, you said it yourself.
That chick, Janet, she wants you to fail.

307
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,300
So, why not instead of hanging around here,
you go home and you make an effort.

308
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,000
If not for yourself, do it for me.

309
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,800
Please?

310
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Hi.

311
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,500
Hello.

312
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,200
Where'd my dad go?

313
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,000
I try not to make a habit of caring.

314
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,500
Gotta be kinda weird for him, you know.

315
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,600
I mean, one second he's doing his own thing,
and I show up.

316
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,600
Know what I'm saying, grandma?

317
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Call me Ruth.

318
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,200
Grandma makes me sound old.

319
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,800
Ruth makes you sound old.

320
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,800
I like you.

321
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,000
Let's talk.

322
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Good night.

323
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,300
You like that, motherfucker?

324
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,600
Shit.

325
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,900
Morning.

326
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,900
Morning.

327
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,000
Where'd you go last night?

328
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,700
I had... things to do.

329
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,400
Like, what kind of things?

330
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,500
Had to meet a friend.

331
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,400
That's cool.

332
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,500
Hey, just so you know. My mom knows I'm here.

333
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,500
I told her that after 11 years of lying,
she owed me at least a week with you.

334
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,200
- Don't you have school?
- It's Sunday.

335
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Oh, right.

336
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,800
That's right.

337
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,600
So...

338
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,800
If you're 11, that means you're in the 6th grade.

339
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,100
7th. I skipped ahead.

340
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,000
- Really?
- I have a good brain.

341
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,900
Can you believe the way we
just ran into each other?

342
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,700
I mean that's gotta be a sign or something, right?

343
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,200
Like, we were supposed to
meet and spend time together.

344
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Yeah, yeah. Maybe.

345
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,700
Did you want some coffee or something?

346
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,600
No, thanks.
I tried it once and I didn't sleep for like a week.

347
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,900
We've got a lot of catching up to do.
I want to know everything about you.

348
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,900
So what does my dad like to do?
Do you like to fix stuff?

349
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,300
No, not particularly.

350
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,900
Do you like bowling? Are you a good bowler?

351
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,700
I'm pretty sure I'm not.

352
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,100
- Did you know I'm on the basketball team?
- Really?

353
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,200
Yeah, point guard.

354
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,200
- That's cool. You must be... pretty good.
- Yeah.

355
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,800
Actually I'm probably the best one on the team.

356
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,400
I gotta run. Practice. Bye, dad.

357
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,800
Not having a structured daily schedule,
it really takes some getting used to.

358
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,600
You'll figure it out.

359
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,100
Really appreciate you getting me this job.

360
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,400
I wish I could do more, Ken.

361
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,400
I really do.

362
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,300
What a practice.
I mean, I've been hot before but tonight was crazy.

363
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,700
I was totally on fire from three-point land.

364
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,300
I was like... Pop! Pop! Pop!

365
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,800
Honestly, I felt kinda bad for the other girls.

366
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,700
- Did you want some ice cream?
- No, I'm cool. I just...

367
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,100
thought I'd swing by and keep you company,
you know, and get to know each other a little.

368
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,000
Hey, Boyd, It's not cocktail hour, Boyd.

369
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,500
Oh, of course not, sir.

370
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,200
Table four has got some new gum on its underside.

371
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,400
Go introduce yourself.

372
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,200
- Hey, mister.
- Yes?

373
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,700
- You're rich, right?
- Well, I...

374
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,800
- do quite well.
- I'm sure.

375
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,200
- What kind of car do you drive?
- It's a champagne Camry.

376
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Wow! That's a sweet car, mister.

377
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,600
- How fast does it go?
- Actually I've had it up to about 91.

378
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,900
Awesome! I'm totally gonna tell my
parents to get me a Camry when I grow up.

379
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,000
Thanks, mister.

380
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,900
Nice kid.

381
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,400
Shittin' yourself now, huh?

382
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,800
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

383
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,500
- I'm doing something.
- Get your ass home.

384
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,100
- How old is my dad in this picture?
- I'm a little busy right now, ma.

385
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,300
She won't stop talking.

386
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
- Is this my dad with the beard?
- Oh, God, oh.

387
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,500
Home... Now!

388
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,000
Can I have 10 minutes?

389
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,000
Sure would made things easier if
he'd put a return address on here.

390
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,600
Shit.

391
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,400
That...

392
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,500
is... weird.

393
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,300
What the hell's happening in my town, sheriff?

394
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,600
Doing everything we can, sir.

395
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,500
- Well, it's clearly not enough.
- Sir, with all due respect,

396
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,700
you don't want to bring in outside help.
That's fine.

397
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,400
But that just leaves me and
Ernie here to solve the problem.

398
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,000
And hell! Those other two guys can barely read.

399
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,000
Now, you can't tie our legs behind our backs,
and ask us to sprint.

400
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,000
So, please either call in reinforcements,
take my badge, or shut the fuck up.

401
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,800
It's quite a tableau, huh, Ernie?

402
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,400
Tableau, sir?

403
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,500
Allow yourself to look at this
thing in the greater context,

404
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,000
as part of the whole.

405
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,300
The killer's use of...

406
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,700
abstract expressionism.

407
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,700
In the obvious homage to the
great works of Marcel Duchamp.

408
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:44,800
It's like the bodies before it, is displayed
with a sense of minimalistic purity constraint.

409
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,700
Like the dumpster, the wicker chair.

410
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,400
Now, you see the bathtub, it's...

411
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,400
Imprisonment.

412
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,900
I bring justice.

413
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,700
Punishment.

414
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,600
Punishment for what, you think?

415
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,600
I have no idea.

416
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,600
Why do you smell like eucalyptus?

417
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,900
- How's the spaghetti, hun?
- Great, thanks.

418
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,300
Good.

419
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,900
- Do you cook, dad?
- I made lasagna once.

420
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
- Yeah?
- It was pretty good.

421
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,100
Really?

422
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,600
Don't make me lie twice, Ken.

423
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
So how do you like Green Oaks so far?

424
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,300
It's cool. Not much happens really.

425
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,100
Well, we have an owl festival in a couple of weeks.

426
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,800
- There have been some murders.
- Yeah?

427
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,500
Walt, we do not need to talk about this.

428
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,600
Oh, c'mon, she's a big girl. What are you, 19?

429
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,400
- 11.
- That's close enough.

430
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,600
- Do you have any idea who's doing it?
- Well let's put it this way, hun,

431
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,000
if we dumped all of our leads into a bucket,
and then dunked your head in, you wouldn't drown.

432
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,700
But don't tell the mayor that.

433
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,900
- Dad?
- Oh, hey.

434
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,500
Whatcha doing?

435
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
- Errands.
- Errands?

436
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,100
- Well, it's just...
- In Clifton?

437
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,700
Clifton.

438
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
You came to give me a ride home, didn't you?

439
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,200
I'll take that as a yes.

440
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,300
What's with all this?

441
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:02,900
Oh, these are... When it rains, the floor
wells get damp, so I use these to block them.

442
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,900
- Your car smells.
- Sorry.

443
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,800
That's okay.

444
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,500
It's a good thing you're driving,
cuz I've gotten like 8 DUIs.

445
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,600
I'm kidding.

446
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,000
Let's go.

447
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,800
- What's this?
- It's an ice cream sundae.

448
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,500
- Boring.
- You don't want it?

449
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,800
Well, the whole plan is to mix
as many flavors as possible.

450
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Cranberries, yogurt chips,
coconut thingies, caramel.

451
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,600
You gotta spice it up.

452
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,000
- Hey, do you have any gummy worms back here?
- That's disgusting.

453
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,600
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I am.

454
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,700
Check out what I got at the gas station.

455
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,500
- I know some people who could use one of these.
- Yeah, me too.

456
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,400
I would've gotten more, but that was the last one.

457
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,300
Don't look now. But there is a woman over there,

458
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,600
who's totally checking you out.

459
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,000
Way not to look. Go help her.

460
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Nah, Betsy can help her.

461
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,900
Hey, Betsy. Can I borrow you for a sec?

462
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,900
- What're you doing?
- My dad will help that customer.

463
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,600
- I have a birds and bees question.
- Okay.

464
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,800
Ken, would you be a dear?

465
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,200
Hi. Ken, right?

466
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,500
- Yeah.
- Stephanie.

467
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,200
Hi, Stephanie.

468
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,900
ls that your daughter?

469
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,500
Ah... Yeah... No... I... Yeah... Yeah.

470
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,700
So we're still waiting on the paternity test then.

471
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,800
Oh, no, no, no. She... she's... she's my daughter.

472
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,000
- She's... Yeah.
- She clearly adores you.

473
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
- You think?
- Yes, I do.

474
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
I'll tell you what.

475
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,000
I will trade you my number for another scoop
of that surprisingly good banana-zz thing.

476
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,500
Sure.

477
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,400
Throw in 2 dollars and 90 cents,
and you got yourself a deal.

478
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,900
No, seriously.
If the till is low, my boss will tear me apart.

479
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,200
- You like this stuff, huh?
- Sure.

480
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,800
Why would I... order it.

481
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,300
- Fine then. Bye.
- Bye.

482
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,700
So, where ya gonna take her?

483
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,800
What? Nowhere. I'm not gonna call her.

484
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,500
Yeah, great idea. Women would love that.

485
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,900
I'm in no shape to be going on a date.

486
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,200
Well then, you'll just have to get in shape.

487
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,600
I've got homework. You think about where
you gonna take her, and then we'll discuss.

488
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,500
By the way...

489
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,600
Betsy knows a lot about sex.

490
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,000
Sit down.

491
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,200
What? Am I interrupting something?

492
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,400
We're going to have a date.

493
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,900
- A date?
- You need to practice.

494
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,700
Okay, I don't know a whole lot about you.

495
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,800
But I know you're not much of a talker.
That's okay in this situation.

496
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,500
Let her talk. Women love to talk.

497
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,900
You listen.

498
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,800
- Listen.
- Mm-hm.

499
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I could do that.

500
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,900
You should probably ask a question.

501
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,600
Ask a question? So I should talk?

502
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,400
A little. Just a little would help.

503
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,900
Okay.

504
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,900
- No? Nothing?
- Give me a minute.

505
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,400
Okay, I'll go.

506
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,600
- How'd you get this?
- I don't wanna talk about that.

507
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,200
- Polar bear attack, right?
- No.

508
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,300
- Sword fight?
- No.

509
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
- Steel cage match?
- Not quite.

510
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:07,400
Well, whatever. Your scar's cooler than
Harry Potter's. The lightning bolt.

511
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,900
Gay.

512
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,300
I guess my ultimate goal in
basketball is to get a nickname.

513
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,100
- A nickname, huh?
- Uh-huh.

514
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,100
The Iceman, the Admiral, the Mailman.

515
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,800
If you get a nickname, it's like people
care enough to come up with something.

516
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,100
Plus, Amy's kind of... blah.

517
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,400
I see myself more as a... Georgina.

518
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,800
I like Amy.

519
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,700
I had fun today.

520
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,600
- You did?
- Mm-hm.

521
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,500
We should do it again sometime.

522
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,300
Wanna tuck me in?

523
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,000
C'mon, it's easy.

524
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,300
Pollers report show that only 5 to 10 people
die from tucking their daughters in each year.

525
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,800
Who's the 11 year old girl here?

526
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,000
Good... sleep... you.

527
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,600
- You want this open or closed?
- Open.

528
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,200
- This much?
- Yeah, that's good. Thanks.

529
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,500
Don't you fuck this up.

530
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,500
We're gonna get freaky on her Murphy bed.

531
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,000
I will have the vegetable plate, thank you.

532
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,000
I'll have the curry goat, and a side order of ribs.

533
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,000
What was it? Oh, yes.

534
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,800
I've been here about 8 months, maybe.

535
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,500
I just... I needed a change of scenery from
Cincinnati, so...

536
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,800
- Cincinnati?
- Well, London, before that.

537
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,900
I followed a guy back to the States, like a
little puppy. And then the two of us married.

538
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,200
Despite knowing absolutely nothing about
one another, which I don't recommend.

539
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,900
So... How is Green Oaks treating you?

540
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,900
Yeah, it's... So far so good.

541
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,300
I am working at a travel agency, which is...

542
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,700
pretty blah.
The other lady there smells like charcoal.

543
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But, you know I'm just using it
to get some cheap trips, and

544
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,400
I'm hoping to fly back to England, and

545
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,400
visit my parents. Eat some humble pie.

546
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,800
Do you like to travel?

547
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,200
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

548
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,800
I've never really traveled.

549
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,000
Ever? Anywhere?

550
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,800
How is that possible?

551
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,600
- Well, I've been away.
- Away?

552
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,100
What? Like prison?

553
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,400
Sorta. Cotton Valley State Hospital.

554
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Is that the... this... like...

555
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,300
A place for crazy people, yeah.

556
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,900
I'll close my eyes,
and give you a chance to leave.

557
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,600
I won't be offended.

558
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,800
My ex was a Harvard-educated pediatrician.

559
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,100
He turned out to be an alcoholic cocksucker
who videotaped me while sleeping,

560
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:07,900
and cheated on me throughout our sham of a
marriage. I try not to clench up.

561
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,300
It always blows my mind that
people can draw with such detail.

562
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,800
If I drew a stick figure,

563
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,900
with an arrow pointing to it saying "stick figure",
you'd still be like, what did she draw?

564
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,800
This is kind of amazing.

565
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,700
Yup, it's nice.

566
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,800
What do we have here then?

567
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,300
A frustrated artist, or a harsh critic?

568
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,700
No, I leave the art to the artist.

569
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,800
Oh!

570
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,500
No...

571
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,300
I can't believe they made me buy it.

572
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,000
Weird.

573
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,900
- I had a very good time. Thank you.
- Me too.

574
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,400
- I had fun.
- Good.

575
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,400
- Good night then.
- I bought this painting for you.

576
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,900
Oh, lovely. Thank you.

577
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,600
I don't know where I'm going to...
Can you get the door?

578
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,900
Okay, take care.

579
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,600
- Bye now.
- Bye.

580
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,700
- Whatcha doing out here, Kenny?
- Hey, sheriff.

581
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,500
Just a little private time to draw.

582
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,300
Wrap my mind around things.

583
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,000
Yeah, I hear ya.

584
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,700
There's a lot going on these days, huh?

585
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,300
So, drawing helps you, right?

586
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,200
You know, for me, it's chess.

587
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,400
I don't actually play the game but just thinking
about it for some reason relaxes the shit out of me

588
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,100
Let me have a look see at that.

589
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,200
C'mon, Kenny, I hear you got real talent.

590
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,900
- Who said that?
- Well, your good buddy, Irv.

591
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,500
I heard him pushing you to do the owl fest.
That guy, you know,

592
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,700
trying to get you to do the brochures,
or the flyers and stuff.

593
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,500
- He did?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Irv, yeah.

594
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,400
He was pushin ol' Glen really hard, but

595
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,300
apparently Glen's already got a guy.

596
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,800
I'd never seen Irv so worked up,

597
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,700
especially over something that doesn't
really concern him. You want a piece of gum?

598
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,800
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

599
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,500
So...

600
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,500
C'mon, let me have a look at that.

601
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,700
Wait. Look at that.

602
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,500
- That's a thing of beauty, Kenny.
- Really?

603
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
I tell ya that you...

604
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,100
You think?

605
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,100
You got an eye on you, kid.

606
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,500
Well... I'll leave you to it.

607
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
You have a good one.

608
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,300
I'm not seeing it, Ernie. All I'm seeing are

609
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,300
tire tracks and mud.

610
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,500
Now, you say I'm supposed to be
seeing a hidden image of Jesus here?

611
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,900
No. No, sir. Just the tracks.

612
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,300
These are the tracks that we
picked up at the drive-in movie.

613
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,200
They are made by Yokohama Avid T4s.

614
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,200
But it's a really common tire.

615
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,800
- How common?
- Gary from the Tire Center...

616
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,900
said that he sold that model to hundreds
of customers just in this year alone.

617
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,600
You should go get a list from Gary,
and then...

618
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,300
cross-reference it with Green Oaks High grads.

619
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,500
- Green Oaks High?
- All the victims were from Green Oaks High,

620
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,900
and right now that's the only connection they have.

621
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,300
There you go, Mildred,
an extra scoop of praline on me.

622
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,300
Oh, thank you.

623
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,300
You have a nice day, now.

624
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,900
- Hey, Irv. Could you do me a huge favor?
- Yeah, what's up?

625
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,800
I want to catch the end of Amy's practice.
Will you cover for me?

626
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,600
- Yeah, man. Of course.
- Thanks a lot.

627
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,800
Give me one more and I will pass out.

628
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,700
Wonderful, wonderful.

629
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,000
Keep it moving. Let's hustle.

630
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,400
Nice, nice.

631
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,700
Okay, that's a good sound.
I heard the swish of the best. Nicely done.

632
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,800
Well done. All right, come up. Okay, all right.

633
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,800
You know what? I'm gonna step out.
You guys keep playing around.

634
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Do you wanna be Wheeler?

635
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,300
Do you wanna be Wheeler?
No, you don't wanna be Wheeler.

636
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,400
Keep playing. Keep playing like
you know how to play basketball.

637
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,700
No, I'm just trying to figure out.

638
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,600
Why you're even on the team, Wheeler, when you
know you're not gonna get any playing time?

639
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,200
Yeah, wearing the uniform

640
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,600
doesn't make you a player. All right?

641
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,400
And wearing a purity ring
doesn't make you a virgin.

642
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,300
What did you just say?

643
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,200
Yeah.

644
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,900
Go get it.

645
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,600
Hey!

646
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,200
Next time, why don't you pick
on someone your own si...

647
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,100
Wow. Nice, buddy.

648
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,700
Sorry, I don't mean to be
laughing about your accident.

649
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,800
I... You know...

650
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,400
It's fine. I just...

651
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,600
The next time I see that other car,
It's gonna be a little awkward.

652
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,400
I refuse to drive.
It's something about the steering wheel

653
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,200
that I can't get out of my mind. Like a little
tug here or there, and you've killed someone,

654
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,600
which is just... is too much power for me.

655
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,800
I guess I'll take power wherever I can get it.

656
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,000
You're a dad.
You have all the power in the world.

657
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,300
That's like the world's worst greeting card ever.

658
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,700
Hey, Toots!
Why don't you stop by the surplus store sometime.

659
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,700
Clearly you're into damaged goods.

660
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,600
He's a little wanker, isn't he?

661
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,900
- You know what we should do?
- What?

662
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,100
I think we should buy Amy something.

663
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,900
- Buy her something? Like what?
- I don't know. Use your imagination.

664
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,300
Up for some action?

665
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,700
You know what? I'm pretty exhausted.
Practice was crazy.

666
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,000
- I know.
- You know what?

667
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,500
I know you suck.
I mean, I stopped by at practice to pick you up.

668
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,800
I saw.

669
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,000
Coach needed 8 for a team,
and only 8 showed up for tryouts.

670
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,800
It doesn't matter.

671
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,800
Let's see your form.

672
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,800
C'mon, let's go.

673
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,200
I could teach you that shot if you want.

674
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,700
All right, balance.

675
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,700
Legs shoulder-width apart.

676
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,000
And your knees.

677
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,700
Okay, you hold the ball with this hand.

678
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,900
- And shoot with this hand, okay?
- Okay.

679
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,000
That's good.

680
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,600
Watch me.

681
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,500
Were you on your high school team?

682
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,900
- Not exactly.
- Not exactly?

683
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,800
You going to be all secretive, huh?

684
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,500
- I didn't make the team.
- Hey, an answer! See, now it wasn't so hard?

685
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,200
Shoot.

686
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,200
I think that was actually closer.

687
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's like some horrible parlor
game I don't understand.

688
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,100
Well, 6 more and we could field a baseball team.

689
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,900
Not the time, sorry.

690
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,900
Where're those yearbooks?

691
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,500
- You going out?
- Yeah, in a few minutes.

692
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,500
- Where are you going?
- Just have to take care of a few things.

693
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,000
So, we have a pretty big game on Thursday and

694
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,100
I'd like you to come. Will you come?

695
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,700
Sure, I'll come.

696
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,800
- And bring Stephanie.
- Yeah?

697
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
You like her, don't you?

698
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,900
- Nah.
- You player.

699
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,500
Okay, I'll call her.

700
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,000
Sweet. I'll be the one on the bench.

701
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,400
All right.

702
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,700
- Good night.
- Night.

703
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,200
They're all on the same fucking team!

704
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,000
- What?
- Yes! Look at that!

705
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,400
Look at that! The Bee, the Black Cat,

706
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,300
- the Map of the U.S.!
- He's picking off the whole team.

707
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,500
There's only one of them who still lives here.

708
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,400
Miller's.

709
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,500
No, we're closed.

710
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,300
We're open at nine. Nine.

711
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Shit. Fucker!

712
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,400
Who the fuck's out there?

713
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,500
I just cleaned this fucker.
You do not wanna do this.

714
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,100
I was in the Green Berets, asshole.
And the Navy SEALs.

715
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,400
And, I was a Gettysburg...

716
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,900
Fuck! Fuck me!

717
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,800
I think I still have bullets.

718
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,200
Shit.

719
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,500
He didn't dump it. Why?

720
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,500
No, he still has skid marks outside.

721
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,900
He left in a damn hurry. Somebody interrupted him.

722
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,800
He got spooked.

723
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,100
Think he's all gone?

724
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,900
Sir?

725
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,300
Found another body last night.

726
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,100
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

727
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,700
What happened to your hand?

728
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:55,100
I was opening a box of sprinkles,
and the box cutter got away from me.

729
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:59,100
That's a hazardous job you got there.
You should be more careful.

730
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,700
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

731
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,200
And when your hand scars,
your wrist will have a new friend.

732
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,400
The tire tracks, outside of Miller's store,

733
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,900
match the tire tracks in the
mud of the drive-in theater.

734
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,400
And, according to Gary, from the Tire Center,

735
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,700
Ken purchased a set a few months back.

736
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,500
Yeah, same kinda tire, but

737
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,800
not enough to get us to Boyd.

738
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,900
But he did go to Green Oaks High.

739
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,800
Yeah, but what's his connection
to the basketball team?

740
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,200
Well, can't we at least
bring him in for questioning?

741
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:49,000
No, no, no, not yet. Boyd may be fucking weird,
but I can't arrest him for - fucking weird.

742
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,100
Besides, if I bring Ruth's son in, I'm wrong,

743
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,400
she's likely to stop giving it up,
and I've sorta taken a shine to her.

744
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:57,900
Oh, hey!

745
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,900
What's up?

746
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,300
Hey, going to work.

747
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,400
We're going for smokes. You in, hun?

748
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,000
No, thanks. Too many fractions to multiply.

749
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,000
Okay, be back soon.

750
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,400
Amy?

751
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,100
Hey.

752
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,100
What'd you do?

753
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,100
- What?
- She left.

754
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,900
I went out, came back.

755
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,200
She was gone.

756
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,700
I thought I told you not to fuck this up.

757
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,100
Amy.

758
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,500
Didn't work out.

759
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,300
- Well, I hate to say, "I told you so."
- Then, don't.

760
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,500
Now, you know why I kept you away.

761
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,600
He's a loser, Amy.

762
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,600
Asshole!

763
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,100
It's been going on for 3 days.

764
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,900
C'mon, get inside. You're damn near on time.

765
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,100
I know what it is. I'm not your speed limit.

766
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,600
- You working tonight?
- I asked for Betsy's shift.

767
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,100
- I thought you had Amy's game.
- No, I'm not going.

768
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,300
Why?

769
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,000
- She left.
- She left?

770
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,900
Yeah.

771
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,700
- Why?
- I don't know.

772
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,200
- Didn't you call her?
- No.

773
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,100
Come on, Ken, why not?

774
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,100
Cuz I didn't.

775
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,500
I mean who the fuck was I kidding,
I'm not a father.

776
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,200
We had it right when she thought I didn't exist.
I told you. She shouldn't be around me.

777
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,300
Whatever, man.

778
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,800
- No extra scoop?
- Not today.

779
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,000
Hi, it's me... Stephanie.

780
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,200
I'm just... I'm calling to see if you're okay,

781
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,800
cuz I think we...

782
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,900
had plans to go to Amy's game tonight.

783
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,600
You know, so... Give us a call.

784
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:45,500
You're a Jackal. Be strong. Come on. Walk it off.

785
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
Wheeler, you're in.

786
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,400
Ha ha, very funny, coach.

787
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,900
Well, we're up 28 points. With 6 seconds left,
I'm actually curious to see if you can eff this up.

788
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,700
Awesome.

789
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,700
What are you doing here?

790
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,000
What? It's nice to see you too.

791
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,500
What do you want?

792
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,100
Wow. Um...

793
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:22,100
I was just...
I came... by to see why you stood me up.

794
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,200
I had to work.

795
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,800
You couldn't have called or...

796
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,000
It's not gonna work out, all right?

797
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,800
I don't understand, cuz...

798
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,700
we were having a really nice time together.

799
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:28,000
4 homicides have been commited in
the small community of Green Oaks.

800
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,800
Kenneth Boyd, 34, a local resident,
was taken into custody late last night,

801
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,900
for his involvement in the grisly
slayings of 4 other Green Oaks residents.

802
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,300
All were killed in what police are
calling premeditated executions,

803
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,300
utilizing a hatchet, machete, and butcher knife.

804
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,300
Boyd was recently released from
Cotton Valley State Hospital,

805
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:49,800
after a stint for clinical
depression and suicidal tendencies.

806
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,700
The victims have been identified as Marty Prichard,
Wade Hutchinson, Lyle Bagwell, and Brett Miller.

807
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,200
All local businessmen.
For more on this story as it develops...

808
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,900
Hey!

809
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,700
You know, I got to admit, Kenny. I was...

810
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,100
I was hoping it wasn't you.
Turn that thing on, will you, please?

811
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,500
It's the red button on the player.

812
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,600
I'm sorry I went into your room, but...

813
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,400
I tell ya, these... these drawings.
Excuse me, these drawings,

814
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,200
they are just beautiful. All of them.

815
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,900
Look at that.

816
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,300
I mean, in a fucked up kinda way.

817
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,800
Also, you left this...

818
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,900
in a couple of the crime scenes.

819
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,100
That's the thing about tires. They leave tracks.

820
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,800
So, you know, it took us a while,

821
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,500
to figure out what your connection
to all this was, Kenny.

822
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:01,700
I mean, who would hate the basketball team that
much that he'd kill 'em a whole buncha years later.

823
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,900
You know, I was at the mayor's office today and...

824
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,400
Want some gum?

825
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,900
We were discussing the upcoming festival, you know.

826
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,300
It hit me.

827
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,100
Who would have motive?

828
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,900
Who?

829
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,800
Who?

830
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:30,800
Who-oo?

831
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,100
Exactly.

832
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,700
The Owl. Whooooo.

833
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,900
Look, Irv. I'm sorry about your friend.

834
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,600
You stood up for him, and he let you down.

835
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,300
But how shocked can you really be?

836
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,300
I mean, you spend your whole life fuckin' up,

837
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,300
you're bound to snap, right?

838
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,300
Come on.

839
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,500
Give me some of that "Fooger" energy.

840
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,000
Amy.

841
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,200
- Hey.
- Hey, Irv.

842
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:57,300
I was wondering if I could talk to you,
but, about my dad.

843
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,100
Like, right now?

844
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,000
You knew him pretty well.
I thought maybe you can clear some stuff up for me.

845
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,100
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Come on in.
- Thanks.

846
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,000
Did you visit my dad a lot when he was away?

847
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,900
No. No, I didn't.

848
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,600
- Just... Sit there.
- How come?

849
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,000
Well, you know, I really wanted to,

850
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,300
but it was hard.

851
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,900
I didnt really...

852
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,200
I didn't like seeing him like that.

853
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,100
Why did he hate those basketball players so much?

854
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,700
I mean, he wanted to be on the team.

855
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,700
And when he didn't make the cut, he was crushed.
You know, they made him the mascot.

856
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,500
And...

857
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,600
for a while, he thought he was one of the guys.

858
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,900
But, of course, the assholes on the team,
they didn't see it that way.

859
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,000
And, it built...

860
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,300
and it built to the point where...

861
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,700
where they thought they could do anything to him.

862
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,700
And then this comic book came out.
And it made them look like idiots.

863
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,100
I mean, these players.
They were used to being treated like kings.

864
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,100
And now...

865
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,900
the whole school was making fun of them.

866
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,900
So, one night,

867
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,600
they decided to make him pay for it.

868
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,400
What did they do?

869
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,400
Do you want some water?
Let me get you some water, okay?

870
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,100
- He didn't confess?
- No.

871
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,300
No.

872
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,100
But he also didn't deny it either.

873
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,700
He just, kind of, sat there.

874
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:32,100
I never thought he'd hurt someone.

875
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,500
You know, it's hard to imagine
what those guys did to him.

876
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,400
But, whatever it was, it stuck.

877
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,500
Look, I know it's a little awkward now
seeing as I just arrested your son

878
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:59,400
for murdering a bunch of people but I hope,
in time,

879
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,200
- we could get pass this?
- Not likely.

880
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,100
- You mind if I grab a cold one for the road?
- No.

881
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,600
I'm gonna drink and drive, so don't tell the cops.

882
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,000
Amy made that for me. Fucking adorable, ain't it?

883
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:50,000
I wish I were creative.
Must be one hell of a release.

884
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,300
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

885
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,300
What was that?

886
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:15,300
- Oh, that's my cat. He hates being locked up.
- I didn't know you had a cat. What kind?

887
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,700
I don't know. Like a... you know,
just like a cat--cat, regular cat.

888
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:25,300
- You mean, other... You mean, other kinds?
- Yes, sure, there's like 40 different breeds.

889
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,300
See? I didn't know that.

890
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:32,700
Now these were a real treat, Kenny.
I mean, who doesn't like getting mail?

891
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,900
You literally ramped up the creepy on them.

892
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:45,300
My favorite. Want to know my favorite?
"I am a monster." Gave me the chills.

893
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,700
- You did a really nice job on that.
- Thanks.

894
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:55,800
- What are you doing here, Kenny?
- Excuse me?

895
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:01,700
We never got that message - "I am a monster."
That was... "Son of Sam" or something like that.

896
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,700
- That's good water. Thanks.
- Yeah.

897
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:22,600
- So, is there, like, anything else you needed?
- Your cat doesn't sound so good.

898
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,000
Can I say, "Hi"?

899
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:29,600
No, you see, he's just skittish you know that's why
I put him in the room when I heard the doorbell.

900
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,000
- I'm really good with cats, though.
- I would rather you not.

901
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
- Why?
- I'm just a little overprotective, okay?

902
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,500
- I'll be nice. I promise.
- No, not today, Amy. Okay?

903
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:44,000
- Your cat sounds sick.
- Look, the cat, okay? She's fine.

904
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:48,400
- I thought it was a "he".
- Goddammit kid! I dont need any of this right now!

905
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:57,800
Look, Amy. I just think it would
be best if you went home, okay?

906
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:02,600
- Okay, I'll go. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, that's for the best.

907
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,200
Bye, Amy.

908
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,100
I've been looking at this evidence all wrong.

909
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:32,900
These drawings. They don't indict you. They
exonerate you. I mean, you get it out on the work.

910
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,800
Kill 'em on the page,
so you don't need to kill 'em for real.

911
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:42,000
I mean, you clearly hated the fucking guys,
and you wanted 'em dead, but... Maybe you even...

912
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,500
I don't know, visited some of the crime scenes?

913
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:49,400
Maybe you even tried to convince yourself
that you could actually do it. But,

914
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:57,000
you're a creator, Kenny. You're not a killer.
The only person you could really hurt is yourself.

915
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:07,400
Ooh boy, that leaves us in a very...
a very interesting place here.

916
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:14,600
You kill a bunch of guys on paper,
and then these bunch of guys ends up dead.

917
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,100
Now, it may not have been you. But, it sure as shit
got to be somebody who hated them as much as you.

918
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:27,100
Who... you know. This thirst for... punishment.

919
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,700
Justice, sick. Sick... just...

920
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:41,700
So, what's your pal, Irv, been up to lately?

921
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,700
Quiet. Please keep quiet.

922
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,100
Your father gave him everything he had.
And then he wanted to destroy him.

923
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,900
They tore away his soul. They took away his life.
And I could have stopped it.

924
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:39,000
- You're hurting me!
- Something has to be done, okay?

925
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
- I couldn't let him get away with it.

926
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
- Please let me go!
- I can't. You'll tell.

927
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:02,000
It's over, man. It's over, okay?
Calm down. Calm down.

928
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,400
I never killed anyone before.

929
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,000
When I killed Prichard, it felt good.

930
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:21,000
And when I killed Wade Hutchinson,
it felt fucking great.

931
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:29,700
My hatred began to build. With each asshole
that I killed... Made things better.

932
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,600
Ken didn't have it in him.

933
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,400
He could never do what needed to be done.

934
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,100
You got your 5 guys, Irv. Why Fooger?

935
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,500
I failed to protect him once.

936
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,500
I wasn't gonna fail him again.

937
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,500
The bad guys need to be punished.

938
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,100
Ah, you're quite a friend, Irv.

939
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,600
You would have made a lousy cop.

940
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,100
I wanted to kill them, sheriff.
I wanted to kill them more than anything.

941
01:29:55,100 --> 01:30:00,400
Yeah, I know, but you didn't. If thinking
about killing a bunch of pricks made us guilty,

942
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,500
we'd all be locked up for life.

943
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,800
You know, wait a minute. I gotta ask you, Kenny.

944
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,600
Why were you willing to go down for it?

945
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:33,000
I'm not really sure where I
fit in this world, sheriff.

946
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,400
Being locked away just seems a lot easier.

947
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:44,700
If you don't know your purpose out here,
Kenny, you're dumber than a bag of shit.

948
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,900
- Hi, may I help you?
- Yeah, I'm here for my daughter.

949
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,800
- Oh, sorry. You are...
- Her father. Amy!

950
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,300
- Ken, what are you doing here?
- Dad?

951
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,600
- Hey there. You want to come over?
- Hell, yeah.

952
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,700
Get your stuff.

953
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,500
- Ken you can't come in here and take her like that
- 11 years, Janet.

954
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,500
It's my turn now.

955
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:25,100
So how's it going? You're good?

956
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,000
- This is for you.
- What's this?

957
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,300
- It's a little something.
- Is it a puppy?

958
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,500
That is the best nickname ever.

959
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,100
Thanks, dad.

960
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,200
I'm sorry.

961
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:36,100
I'm sorry about the other day.
I really am. I'm really sorry.

962
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,500
Oh, and innocent.

963
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,500
- I'm excited for the weekend. Who's excited?
- What do you have planned?

964
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:13,300
- Well, there's the owl festival.
- Oh, what else do you have planned?

965
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,000
We can shoot some hoops. How's your shot?

966
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,200
- Still sucks. But I hit backboard now.
- That's good. That's something.

967
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,500
Ma, Amy's here.

968
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,100
No shit, Ken.

969
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:35,100
