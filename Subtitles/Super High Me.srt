1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,333
WE GOT ONE PATIENT
READY TO COME UP.

3
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:17,400
JUST STEP THAT WAY
TO THE DISPENSARY.

4
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:20,367
THANKS.

5
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:25,100
(man)
HOW YOU DOING?

6
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,767
GOOD. HOW YOU DOING?

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,867
(man)
PRETTY GOOD.
WELCOME TO THE HEALTH CENTER.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,867
(Benson)
THANKS.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,767
NICE TO BE HERE.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,933
SO, LIKE, HOW DO YOU--

11
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:38,800
HOW WOULD I EVEN BEGIN
TO DECIDE

12
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,133
WHICH KIND TO CHOOSE?

13
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:43,500
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR LEVEL
OF TOLERANCE.

14
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:46,400
IF YOU'RE A FIRST-TIME PATIENT,
YOU'VE NEVER TRIED IT BEFORE,

15
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,633
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO WITH
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER.

16
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,667
IT'LL GIVE YOU MORE, LIKE,
OF A BODY HIGH,

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,900
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING

18
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:53,767
TO GIVE YOU THE FEEL
OF HOW IT'S GOING TO BE.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,400
LIKE, THE PURPLES
ARE MORE OF A--

20
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:57,733
LIKE IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS
SLEEPING

21
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:01,167
AND BACK PAINS AT NIGHT,
YOU'RE REAL UNCOMFORTABLE,

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,533
THE PURPLES WILL PUT YOU
TO SLEEP.

23
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:05,067
THEY'RE THE REAL STRONG,
MORE POTENT ONES,

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,167
THAT WITH THE KUSH TOO.

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,533
THEY'RE A LITTLE
MORE POTENT ONES.

26
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,367
SO THE $45 MIX,
THOSE ARE THE ONES

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,233
THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING
TO GET THE FEELING OF IT.

28
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,567
I FEEL HIGH JUST THINKING
ABOUT ALL THIS.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,367
[lively music]

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:29,367
*

31
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:56,533
(man)
I'M GOING TO BRING OUT
YOUR NEXT COMIC NOW.

32
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:57,600
HE'S VERY FUNNY.

33
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,167
HE'S ON VH1; YOU SEE HIM
ON A LOT OF THINGS.

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,033
LET'S GIVE IT UP
FOR MR. DOUG BENSON.

35
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,567
[cheers and applause]

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
(Benson)
I SAW THAT MOVIE SUPER SIZE ME
WHEN I WAS HIGH.

37
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,333
MISTAKE!

38
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,467
THAT IS FUCKED UP, YOU KNOW,

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,333
'CAUSE THE PREMISE
OF THAT MOVIE

40
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,300
IS THAT IT'S BAD TO EAT
A LOT OF McDONALD'S,

41
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,400
AND I'M SITTING THERE ALL HIGH,
LIKE, THINKING,

42
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:23,567
"OH, I COULD GO FOR A HOT APPLE
OR A FRENCHIE AT THIS POINT.

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,267
HOOK ME UP, MAN."

44
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,233
AND HE'S JUST GORGING IT ALL
ON HIMSELF

45
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:33,167
AND THEN THROWING UP, AND, OH,
IT'S DISGUSTING, THAT MOVIE.

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,067
IF THAT'S A MOVIE,

47
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,233
IF EATING McDONALD'S
FOR 30 DAYS IS A MOVIE

48
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,667
AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING
TO PAY TO SEE IT,

49
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,100
I'VE GOT A MOVIE.

50
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:45,433
I'M GOING TO SMOKE POT EVERY DAY
FOR 30 DAYS,

51
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:46,600
TRY TO REMEMBER TO FILM IT...

52
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,300
[laughter]

53
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:54,633
AND MY MOVIE'S GOING
TO BE CALLED SUPER HIGH ME

54
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:55,733
OR BUSINESS AS USUAL.

55
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:56,767
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET...

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,667
[laughter and applause]

57
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,400
ON THE TITLE.

58
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:04,533
SO THAT STARTED OUT
AS A JOKE IN MY ACT,

59
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:10,200
AND THEN A FILMMAKER--
I'M USING THE TERM LOOSELY--

60
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:13,167
SAW ME SAY THAT,
AND WE HAD A DISCUSSION,

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,233
AND WE'RE REALLY FUCKING
DOING IT.

62
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:16,967
(male narrator)
DOUG BENSON:

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,333
STAND-UP COMEDIAN,
NOTED POT SMOKER.

64
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,433
IN FACT, HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE
RECENTLY NAMED DOUG

65
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:25,333
THE NUMBER TWO POT COMIC
IN THE COUNTRY.

66
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:30,033
BUT THAT DOESN'T PUT DOUG BENSON
ABOVE THE LAW,

67
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,133
SO HOW CAN THIS BE POSSIBLE?

68
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:34,700
IN 1996, THE CITIZENS
OF CALIFORNIA

69
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,167
PASSED PROPOSITION 215,
WHICH ALLOWS PATIENTS

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,233
TO USE CANNABIS
FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES

71
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:42,500
IF THEY GET A RECOMMENDATION
FROM THEIR DOCTOR.

72
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:46,200
COMMON USES FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS
INCLUDE CHRONIC PAIN, HIV/AIDS,

73
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,000
DEPRESSION, NAUSEA,
OR A MEDICAL CONDITION

74
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:50,367
YOUR DOCTOR THINKS
IS APPROPRIATE.

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,733
KEEP IN MIND, THE EFFECTS
OF MARIJUANA VARY

76
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,333
WITH EVERY USER.

77
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,633
THIS IS THE STORY
OF JUST ONE PATIENT,

78
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,200
AND DESPITE YEARS
OF MARIJUANA USE,

79
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,600
EVEN THE NUMBER TWO
POT COMIC IN THE COUNTRY

80
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,033
HAS NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

81
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:08,933
WHEN HE GETS SUPER HIGH.

82
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:11,433
(Benson)
I'M NOT GETTING HIGH EVERY DAY
FOR 30 DAYS YET,

83
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,800
BECAUSE THERE'S A CATCH.

84
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,400
I HAVE TO NOT GET HIGH
FOR 30 DAYS

85
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,733
BEFORE GETTING HIGH
FOR 30 DAYS

86
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:22,967
TO SHOW HOW AWFUL IT IS
WHEN I CAN'T GET HIGH AT ALL

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,900
TO CONTRAST WITH HOW AWESOME

88
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,000
THE NEXT 30 DAYS
ARE GOING TO BE.

89
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,667
SO I HAVE TO NOT SMOKE
FOR 30 DAYS,

90
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,533
AND THAT'S GOING TO START
AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST.

91
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,267
(man)
* I SHOULD BE ASLEEP,

92
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,800
* BUT I'M AWAKE STILL

93
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:47,700
*

94
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,900
(man)
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL,
FIRST DAY?

95
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,333
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

96
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,833
BOY, THAT HAT MADE ME WANT
TO GO SMOKE POT.

97
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:10,433
EVERYTHING REMINDS ME OF POT
NOW THAT I CAN'T HAVE IT.

98
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:13,733
TRAFFIC LIGHTS...

99
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,200
[laughs]

100
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,433
WHEN THEY'RE GREEN.

101
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,000
I'M GOING TO BE HOSPITALIZED,
I THINK.

102
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,367
REALLY?
I THINK SO.

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,667
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
TO BE FUNNY,

104
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,833
OR DO YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THAT?

105
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:30,500
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT.

106
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,233
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE
YOU'LL BE HOSPITALIZED?

107
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:33,367
IT'S GOING TO BE NASTY,

108
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,700
SMOKING ALL DAY EVERY DAY
FOR 30 DAYS.

109
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,767
I'VE NEVER SMOKED, LIKE, THAT--
I SMOKE A LOT OF POT,

110
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,300
BUT I'VE NEVER, LIKE,
DAY AND NIGHT FOR EVERY DAY

111
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,533
FOR 30 DAYS.

112
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,767
SO I'M A LITTLE SCARED.

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,967
BUT HOW AWESOME WOULD IT BE
IF IT FUCKING KILLED ME?

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,267
[laughter]

115
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,667
THAT SPURLOCK MOVIE'D BE
THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE

116
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,167
IF HE JUST DIED AT ONE POINT
DURING IT...

117
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,333
[laughter]

118
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:01,200
FUCKING GRIZZLY MAN STYLE.

119
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,367
(Campbell)
SUPPOSEDLY,

120
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,500
YOUR DEPRESSION
IS GOING TO KICK IN TODAY,

121
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,133
IF IT'S GOING TO KICK IN.

122
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,000
SO THEY SAID,
TAKE THIS TEST.

123
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:14,733
RIGHT, BUT, LIKE--
THE ONLY ANSWER I CAN GIVE

124
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:15,667
IS RARELY--

125
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,633
WELL, NO,
BUT YOU WOULD EXAMINE--

126
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,967
'CAUSE IT'S ONLY BEEN
ONE DAY.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,467
THAT'S OKAY.

128
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,800
BUT YOU'RE ALSO--
IT'S HOW YOU FELT

129
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,233
OVER THE PAST WEEK,
EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE SMOKING.

130
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,933
RIGHT? AND NOW
WE'RE GOING TO GO,

131
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:28,400
AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
THE SAME TEST

132
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:29,767
IN ANOTHER WEEK,

133
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,267
AND THAT'LL BE
WHEN YOU'RE NOT SMOKING.

134
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,467
(Benson)
I JUST DON'T--I'M NOT--

135
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,600
I'M NOT ON BOARD
WITH THIS ONE,

136
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,667
'CAUSE I SPENT THE LAST WEEK
SOME DAYS SMOKING,

137
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,967
SOME DAYS NOT,
AND I BARELY REMEMBER--

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,567
THIS IS ABOUT DEPRESSION.

139
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,067
SO THIS IS DAY TWO,

140
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,600
AND I'M DOING GREAT.

141
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:51,900
IT'S--SO FAR,
IT'S FUCKING NOT A PROBLEM.

142
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,433
I CAN TOTALLY NOT SMOKE POT
FOR TWO DAYS.

143
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,867
I'M JUST WRITING "RARELY"
ON EVERY ONE OF THESE.

144
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,733
(Campbell)
THAT'S TAKING IT
REAL SERIOUSLY.

145
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,633
WELL, I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN--

146
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:02,700
I SPENT THE WEEKEND

147
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,633
GETTING FUCKING CRAZY HIGH
ALL WEEKEND.

148
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:05,700
I CAN'T REMEMBER--

149
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,533
WELL, DID YOU FEEL FEARFUL
AT ALL

150
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:08,667
DURING THE LAST SEVEN DAYS?

151
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,167
I DON'T REMEMBER.

152
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,833
MAYBE, LIKE IF I SAW
A COP COMING

153
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:13,100
OR SOMETHING OR--
I DON'T KNOW.

154
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,133
(Campbell)
DID YOU HAVE ANY CRYING SPELLS?

155
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,567
NO.
OKAY.

156
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,300
DID YOU FEEL HOPEFUL
ABOUT THE FUTURE?

157
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,400
I MIGHT HAVE.

158
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:24,200
AND, I MEAN,
THESE ARE MOSTLY FEELINGS

159
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,433
THAT I DON'T HAVE EVER.

160
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,300
OVER THE COURSE
OF THE TWO 30-DAY PERIODS,

161
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,900
WE'RE GOING TO DO
LOTS OF TESTS, YOU KNOW,

162
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:38,200
LIKE IQ TESTS
AND LUNG CAPACITY

163
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,767
AND JUST A BUNCH OF TESTS.

164
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,567
AND ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO BE,

165
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,767
THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK
MY SPERM COUNT,

166
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,933
AND BY "THEY," I MEAN
I'M HOPING IT'S A DOCTOR.

167
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,633
[laughter]

168
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,100
I HOPE THIS IS NOT A GUY
WITH A LOT OF PLASTIC CUPS

169
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:54,167
THAT HE'S NOT USING.

170
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,333
AND...

171
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,567
[laughter]

172
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,867
THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK
MY SPERM COUNT,

173
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,567
AND SO MY FIRST CHECK,
SPERM CHECK,

174
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,733
IS COMING UP IN THREE DAYS,
ON THURSDAY.

175
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,133
AND THE THING ABOUT GETTING
YOUR SPERM CHECKED IS,

176
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:15,000
YOU CAN'T MASTURBATE
OR EJACULATE INTO A LADY FOR--

177
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:20,767
OR WHATEVER YOUR THING IS--
FOR THREE DAYS.

178
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,233
THREE DAYS,
AND IT STARTED TODAY,

179
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:25,033
THAT I CAN'T--SO I'M, LIKE,
SO MUCH MORE UPSET

180
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,333
THAT I CAN'T MASTURBATE
FOR THREE DAYS

181
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:30,633
THAN I CAN'T SMOKE POT
FOR 30, YOU KNOW,

182
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:36,633
BECAUSE I'M NOT LOOKING AT POT
ON THE INTERNET EVERY DAY.

183
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,433
THIS WAS ALMOST AS FUNNY
AS WHEN YOU'RE HIGH,

184
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:39,700
HONEST TO GOD.

185
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,467
I CAN TELL, BUT AN
UNTRAINED EYE COULDN'T TELL.

186
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,467
BUT I COULD TELL.

187
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,467
IT WAS STILL GOOD, THOUGH.

188
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,600
IT WAS STILL VERY GOOD.

189
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,033
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU STILL LIKED IT.

190
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:50,133
(narrator)
THE PROHIBITION AGAINST
MARIJUANA BEGAN IN 1937.

191
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,700
SINCE THEN, IN ORDER
TO OBTAIN YOUR MEDICINE,

192
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,633
YOU HAD TO VISIT A GUY.

193
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,133
BUT WITH THE PASSING
OF PROPOSITION 215,

194
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,900
CALIFORNIA CITIZENS ARE ALLOWED
TO OPEN UP RETAIL SHOPS

195
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:03,533
KNOWN AS DISPENSARIES
TO LEGALLY SELL CANNABIS

196
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,133
TO QUALIFIED PATIENTS.

197
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,767
TO REPEAT THAT FOR THE STONERS
SHOWING UP LATE,

198
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,600
IN CALIFORNIA, YOU CAN LEGALLY
BUY POT IN A STORE

199
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,033
LIKE YOU'RE BUYING BEER
OR COOKIES.

200
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:23,067
[singing]

201
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,633
RIGHT NOW, IT'S JUST
A FREE-FOR-ALL.

202
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,267
(man)
IT'S THE WILD WEST.

203
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,867
WILD, WILD WEST.

204
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,100
AND I'M JESSE JAMES,
I GUESS, RIGHT NOW.

205
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:33,967
IT'S REALLY STRESSFUL.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,800
ME BEING IN THIS
FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW--

207
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,067
MAN, WHEN I STARTED,
THERE WAS, LIKE, FOUR OF US.

208
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,933
RIGHT.

209
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:44,667
FIRST-TIME PATIENT?
COME ON IN.

210
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:47,967
YEAH, COME ON IN.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,267
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING, CHIEF?

212
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,900
CAN I GET YOUR ID?
YES, SIR.

213
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,033
COME ON.

214
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,367
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR:
INDICA, SATIVA?

215
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,300
A HYBRID.

216
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,533
HYBRID? OKAY.

217
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,867
ANY--I MEAN, YOU GOT
A PAIN TYPE OF THING,

218
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,700
OR YOU JUST WANT THE HEAD
TO BE UP?

219
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,267
(Benson)
THESE ARE TWO JOKES
THAT I'VE WRITTEN

220
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,400
SINCE I STOPPED GETTING HIGH
THREE DAYS AGO,

221
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:48,333
JUST TO SHOW YOU WHERE I'M AT...

222
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,633
[laughter]

223
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:54,133
AND HOW IMPORTANT
MARIJUANA IS TO WHAT I DO.

224
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:57,600
WHY ISN'T THERE
A MILDEW-REMOVAL PRODUCT

225
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,433
CALLED MILDON'T?

226
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:02,433
[laughter]

227
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,600
SEE, THAT'S NOT TOO BAD.

228
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:09,733
I HAVEN'T LOST IT.

229
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:10,700
[laughs]

230
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:11,733
AND HERE'S THE OTHER ONE.

231
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,167
THE NEW SLOGAN FOR OLD NAVY--

232
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,167
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE NEW COMMERCIALS?

233
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,400
IT'S NO LONGER, LIKE,
OLD TV STARS BEING STUPID.

234
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:21,033
NOW IT'S, LIKE, TRYING TO BE HIP
AND COOL AND MATRIX-Y.

235
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:24,533
AND THE SLOGAN IS,
"GET YOUR FASH ON."

236
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:27,367
YOU KNOW, "GET YOUR FASH ON."

237
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,700
"GET YOUR FASH ON,"

238
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:32,667
WHICH WAS PROBABLY--
I WAS THINKING WAS PROBABLY

239
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,400
A REJECTED SLOGAN
FOR FASCISM

240
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:38,900
WHEN THEY WERE SITTING AROUND,

241
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:40,600
COMING UP WITH SLOGANS
FOR FASCISM

242
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,100
TO TRY TO GET IT OFF THE GROUND.

243
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,867
THEY WERE PROBABLY LIKE--
SOMEBODY WAS LIKE,

244
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,200
"HOW ABOUT,
'GET YOUR FASH ON'?"

245
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,733
"GET OUT OF HERE.

246
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,300
"THAT'S STUPID.

247
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:52,067
WE'VE DECIDED TO GO WITH
'FASCISM: WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.'"

248
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,167
[laughter]

249
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,067
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO SMOKE A LOT OF POT

250
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,833
AND HAVE QUITE A LOT OF SUCCESS.

251
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:00,867
I DON'T THINK ONE
PRECLUDES THE OTHER.

252
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,367
JUST A DIFFERENT PATH,
AS THEY SAY.

253
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,433
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION

254
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:22,433
ABOUT MEDICAL MARIJUANA?

255
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,267
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

256
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,067
WHAT'S MY OPINION
ABOUT MEDICAL MARIJUANA?

257
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,833
WELL, THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

258
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,700
IN THE '70s,

259
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,733
THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR
THE REFORM OF MARIJUANA LAWS

260
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,967
FAILED IN THEIR ATTEMPTS
TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES,
MUCH TO MY CHAGRIN IN COLLEGE,

262
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,300
BECAUSE I DID SMOKE,
I DID INHALE,

263
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,367
AND I ATE BROWNIES.

264
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,167
SO THEN WHAT THEY DID WAS,
VERY INTELLIGENTLY,

265
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,100
THEY REWRAPPED THEIR ARGUMENT.

266
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,300
THEY REPACKAGED IT
AS A MEDICAL ARGUMENT,

267
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,900
BECAUSE CANNABINOIDS--
THEY'RE LIKE THC

268
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:55,467
AND OTHER STUFF--THEY DO HAVE
SOME VALUE MEDICALLY

269
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,367
BUT NOT AT ALL
WHAT THE ACTIVISTS ARE SAYING

270
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,567
THEY HAVE.

271
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,767
WHEN I WEAR MY HAT

272
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,100
AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN,

273
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,100
I THINK OUR WAR ON DRUGS
HAS COMPLETELY FAILED,

274
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:07,633
THAT MARIJUANA SHOULD BE LEGAL
FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES,

275
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,067
AND THAT'S
MY PRIVATE CITIZEN HAT.

276
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,333
BUT WHEN YOU COME TO ME

277
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:12,367
AND I'M WEARING
MY LITTLE TIE AND STETHOSCOPE

278
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,967
AND PLAYING DOCTOR HERE,

279
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,700
DO I EVER ASK A PATIENT

280
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,367
TO INHALE
THE CRUDE COMBUSTION PRODUCTS

281
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,733
OF A DRIED PLANT

282
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,367
THAT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT ELSE IS IN IT

283
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,733
AND I ALSO DON'T KNOW
WHAT STRENGTH YOU'RE GETTING--

284
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:26,300
IS IT GOOD SHIT?
IS IT BAD SHIT?

285
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,633
IS IT--YOU KNOW, IS IT STUFF
THAT YOU GREW ON YOUR OWN,

286
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:29,733
YOU GOT FROM MEXICO,

287
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,867
OR DID YOU GET B.C. BUD
FROM COLOMBIA?

288
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,000
WHAT'S IN IT?

289
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:36,100
OKAY, GO AHEAD.
BLOW.

290
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,633
KEEP GOING; KEEP GOING
EVEN THOUGH YOU THINK

291
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,033
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

292
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:43,667
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

293
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,933
JUST RELAX.

294
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,567
I NEED YOU TO TURN YOUR HEAD
TOWARD EITHER WALL--

295
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,667
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH.

296
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,667
GIVE ME A NICE HARD COUGH.

297
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,233
[coughs]
BEAUTIFUL.

298
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:05,767
WHAT'S THE "TURN THE HEAD
TO THE SIDE" PART ABOUT?

299
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,833
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE COUGHED ON?

300
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:08,000
YEAH, EXACTLY.

301
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,233
"OKAY, I'M GOING TO GRAB
YOUR BALLS.

302
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:15,733
NOW I WANT YOU TO COUGH
IN MY FACE."

303
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:19,200
SO, YOU KNOW,
TO CUT TO THE CHASE,

304
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,000
YOU HAVE NOT,
AFTER 17 YEARS OF DOING THIS,

305
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:25,700
YOU HAVEN'T DONE
ANY PERMANENT DAMAGE

306
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:27,433
THAT I CAN TELL.

307
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,367
GOOD MORNING.

308
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,900
HI.

309
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,133
I HAVE YOUR DATE.

310
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:39,700
I HAVE YOUR TEST.

311
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,500
HA HA. CHEERS!

312
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,600
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

313
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,600
(man)
HOW ARE YOU?

314
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:52,433
DOUG.
DOUG, YES.

315
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,400
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

316
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,600
COME ON BACK.

317
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,267
WELL, SO YOU'RE DOING THIS FILM,

318
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,000
AND YOU'VE STOPPED USING
BOTH ALCOHOL AND POT.

319
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:02,800
I WAS WONDERING,
AS YOU LOOK BACK ON IT,

320
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,667
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT POT?

321
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
WHAT DOES IT DO FOR YOU
WHEN YOU SMOKE?

322
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:11,300
UM...

323
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,800
IT JUST--

324
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,767
THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION
I CAN GIVE IS,

325
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,600
IT JUST MAKES EVERYTHING
MORE FUN.

326
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:22,400
YOU KNOW, IT JUST MAKES--

327
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:25,333
MAKES MY BRAIN WORK DIFFERENTLY,
YOU KNOW.

328
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,800
YEAH, IT'S--IT SEEMS LIKE IT,
STRANGELY, GIVES ME

329
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,167
A LONGER ATTENTION SPAN.

330
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,733
SO, YEAH, SO IT'S BEEN SIX DAYS,

331
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,267
AND I'M DOING OKAY.

332
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,700
IT'S NOT--I THINK--
I DON'T THINK IT'S AS ADDICTIVE

333
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:47,033
AS SOME PEOPLE THINK.

334
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:50,400
LIKE, I ONLY THINK
ABOUT SMOKING POT CONSTANTLY.

335
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:51,633
[laughter]

336
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,600
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
I THINK ABOUT IT.

337
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,267
I'M STARTING TO LEARN--

338
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,633
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
MAKING THIS MOVIE

339
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,233
IS FORCING ME TO LEARN TO
ACTUALLY BE INTERESTED IN PEOPLE

340
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,100
AND ASK A QUESTION AFTER
THEY ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION.

341
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:05,300
(Tompkins)
WELL, ISN'T IT MOSTLY PEOPLE

342
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,633
ASKING YOU QUESTIONS?

343
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,767
WELL, NO, WE GO AROUND.

344
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,267
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME, LIKE,

345
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,167
IN DISPENSARIES
AND, YOU KNOW,

346
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,467
WITH PEOPLE
THAT ARE ADVOCATES

347
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,733
FOR POT,
OF WHICH I NORMALLY

348
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,767
AM NOT THAT INTERESTED IN.

349
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,767
RIGHT.

350
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,367
I JUST WANT TO SMOKE IT, SO--

351
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,900
WELCOME TO THE BENSON
INTERRUPTION, EVERYBODY.

352
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,800
[cheers and applause]

353
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:30,000
SO--BUT ALSO I'VE NOT HAD
A DRINK IN OVER A MONTH,

354
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,433
AND THAT IS--

355
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:32,567
[man groans]

356
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,033
FUCKING, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME.

357
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,167
IT'S THE WORST.

358
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,433
SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE,

359
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:39,167
WHEN YOU SAID
THAT YOU'D STOPPED DRINKING,

360
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
ACTUALLY SAID,
"OH, HE LOVES TO DRINK."

361
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:46,333
[laughter]

362
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,733
SHE WAS REALLY CONCERNED

363
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:49,800
THAT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO--

364
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,767
(Benson)
SEE, IT'S TRUE,

365
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,400
AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND,

366
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:54,533
THAT IS A FUCKING SACRIFICE.

367
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,033
LIKE, THAT IS
WHAT I'M GIVING UP,

368
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,000
BECAUSE THE SMOKING,
IT'S NOT A SACRIFICE,

369
00:16:58,033 --> 00:16:59,367
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SAID,
"OH, I USED TO HAVE

370
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,033
SO MANY AWESOME TIMES
WITH MY FRIENDS, SMOKING."

371
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,700
[laughter]

372
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,700
"REMEMBER THAT PARTY
WHEN WE HAD CIGARETTES?"

373
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:08,467
HEY, REMEMBER THAT TIME?

374
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,900
WE HAD TOO MANY
CIGARETTES.

375
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:13,333
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.

376
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,067
I SMOKED SO MANY--

377
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,167
BOY, WE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME.

378
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,367
WE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME.

379
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,967
YEAH, I'M JUST GOING
WITH SOME FRIENDS.

380
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,467
WE'RE GOING TO, LIKE,
GET A COUPLE PACKS OF CIGARETTES

381
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,500
AND PROBABLY JUST GO OUT
ON A PORCH.

382
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:30,667
SO WE'RE DRIVING OUT
TO THE VALLEY

383
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,400
TO FIND OUT ABOUT, APPARENTLY,
IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD,

384
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:38,033
THERE'S A ROGUE COP
WHO SHOWS UP AT DISPENSARIES

385
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,267
AND SHUTS THEM DOWN.

386
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,100
(Duncan)
I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING

387
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,567
RIGHT NOW UP IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD

388
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,100
IS THAT WE HAVE
A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER

389
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:47,033
WHO IS CONFUSED
AND PERHAPS HOSTILE

390
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,333
TO MEDICAL CANNABIS.

391
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,433
AND HE HAS SORT OF SET IT
ABOUT--AS HIS MISSION

392
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:54,233
TO CLOSE THE DISPENSARIES.

393
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:57,100
AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE,
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW

394
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:59,567
IS SORT OF A BREAKDOWN
IN DUE PROCESS.

395
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,867
I'M JUST CURIOUS
ABOUT WHAT A ROGUE COP IS.

396
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,100
YOU KNOW, IS IT JUST ONE GUY

397
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:08,500
WHO JUST PUTS HIS UNIFORM ON
AT HOME

398
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:11,367
AND LOOKS IN THE MIRROR
AND SAYS, "BE CAREFUL OUT THERE"

399
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,767
AND GOES AROUND
SHUTTING THINGS DOWN?

400
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,400
DO YOU THINK A ROGUE COP'S
GOING TO SHOW UP

401
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,433
WHILE WE'RE IN THERE?

402
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,400
NO.
THIS IS DON DUNCAN.

403
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,633
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

404
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,700
DOUG BENSON,
HE'S THE HERO OF OUR MOVIE,

405
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,567
SO TO SPEAK.

406
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,867
(Frye)
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS MR. SMITH

407
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,300
IS JUST--WENT RENEGADE, MAN.

408
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,067
YOU KNOW, I'M A REAL THING.

409
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,167
THIS IS A REAL
BUSINESS LICENSE.

410
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,633
THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

411
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:36,967
AND, OF COURSE,
THE FIRST TWO MONTHS,

412
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,200
THEY THOUGHT THAT, "OKAY,
BLACK DUDE'S ABOUT TO COME HERE

413
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:41,300
AND OPEN UP A DOPE SHOP."

414
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,333
I COULD FEEL IT, OKAY?

415
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,400
BUT WHEN IT DIDN'T TURN OUT
TO BE THAT--

416
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:48,133
"OH, ACTUALLY,
THIS GUY'S AN EX-SCIENTIST,

417
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,033
"AND HE--MASTER'S DEGREE,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

418
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,233
"AND HE'S NOT TURNING INTO THIS,

419
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:52,500
"AND, ACTUALLY,
IT'S PRETTY DAMN GOOD,"

420
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:53,933
'CAUSE WE GOT
A FREE SECURITY GUARD

421
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,133
THAT PATROLS THE PARKING LOT.

422
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,167
THEN I WAS COOL.

423
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,067
THEN SIX MONTHS PASSED.

424
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,133
EVERYTHING'S COOL.

425
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:58,900
PEOPLE THINK
THAT MEDICINAL CANNABIS,

426
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:01,367
WHEN YOU USE THAT WORD,

427
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,533
YOU'RE JUST TALKING
ABOUT STRAIGHT MARIJUANA.

428
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:07,933
HALF OF THE PATIENTS THAT COME
THROUGH HERE CAN'T SMOKE,

429
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN HERE

430
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:11,733
FOR SOME SMOKE-RELATED TYPE OF,
YOU KNOW, DEAL.

431
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:16,500
SO I HAVE ALL TYPES OF PILLS,
AND THIS IS LIP BALM, MY MAN.

432
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,333
THIS IS CHAP STICK,
AND IT DOES THE JOB.

433
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,533
AND IT WORKS?

434
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,000
(Frye)
I HAVE AN OLDER GENTLEMAN

435
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:23,433
WHO SWEARS
BY THIS TOPICAL SPRAY.

436
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,700
YOU PUT IT IN.

437
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,400
BOOM, YOU SPRAY IT ON,
AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS.

438
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,467
THERE'S A LOT
OF DIFFERENT WAYS

439
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,533
OF GETTING THC INTO YOUR SYSTEM,

440
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,167
AND IT'S NOT
ALL ABOUT SMOKING.

441
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,267
DRIVING TO SACRAMENTO.

442
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,833
DOUG REFUSES TO SIT
IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.

443
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,867
SITS BEHIND ME.

444
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,967
[laughter]

445
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,867
THIS WILL ALL BE VERIFIED
IN HIS LITTLE FUCKING--

446
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,767
(Benson)
IT'S CALLED MISS DAISY STYLE.

447
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,300
[laughter]

448
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,400
HE GOES--I SAY, "JUST DON'T
FIRE UP IN MY CAR."

449
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:53,400
YOU KNOW, "IF YOU WANT WEED,
WE'LL PULL OVER,

450
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:54,233
AND WE'LL FUCKING--
OOH, YOU KNOW."

451
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,433
AND WE DRIVE UP TO SACRAMENTO,

452
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:58,767
AND--YOU KNOW, BUT STONERS
ARE ALL LIKE FOUR-YEAR-OLDS.

453
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,733
I SEE HIM BACK THERE,
AND HE STARTS FIRING IT UP.

454
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:04,300
AND I'M LIKE, "I CAN SEE YOU
THROUGH THE REARVIEW MIRROR."

455
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,900
BUT STONERS ARE, LIKE I SAID,
FOUR-YEAR-OLDS,

456
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,100
SO HE'S LIKE, "HEE HEE,
NO ONE CAN SEE ME."

457
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,233
I'M LIKE, "FUCKING IDIOT."

458
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,533
AND I'M LIKE--
I SMELL FIRE AND SMOKE

459
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,933
AND MARIJUANA AND EVERYTHING.

460
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,800
AND HE'S LIKE,
"I'LL BLOW IT OUT THE WINDOW."

461
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,567
SO HE ROLLS DOWN THE WINDOW
AND BLOWS IT OUT.

462
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,967
NOW, BEAR IN MIND
WE'RE ON THE 5, GOING 80.

463
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
SO HE BLOWS IT OUT--AH!

464
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:22,467
IT ALL COMES FUCKING POURING
BACK IN.

465
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,000
I'M LIKE,
"YOU GODDAMN DUMB STONER."

466
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:28,967
"SORRY, IT WAS ALMOST 4:20"
OR WHATEVER HE'S FUCKING--

467
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,533
MY MOM CALLED ME TODAY
AND LEFT ME A MESSAGE

468
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,700
SAYING SHE LOST OR BROKE
HER GLASSES,

469
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,333
SO SHE NEEDS NEW GLASSES,
SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO--

470
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,867
THAT'S THE MAIN REASON
WHY I WANT TO GO

471
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,400
TO THE POST OFFICE TODAY,
'CAUSE I FEEL BAD

472
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,167
THAT SHE'S SITTING AROUND
WITHOUT GLASSES

473
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,733
UNTIL SHE GETS A CHECK FROM ME.

474
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:52,267
(man)
YOU HELP HER OUT
FINANCIALLY?

475
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,067
YEAH, I PAY
FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING.

476
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,467
(Odenkirk)
SEE, THAT'S THE THING.

477
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,767
I'M VERY TORN.

478
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,433
I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO
YOUR DOCUMENTARY,

479
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:15,467
BUT HERE I AM--
I'M VERY TORN ABOUT POT,

480
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,500
BECAUSE I HONESTLY--I WISH
THAT I COULD SMOKE POT,

481
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:20,167
LIKE, TWICE A YEAR.

482
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
I'M SERIOUS.

483
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,600
WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT
TWICE A YEAR?

484
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:24,967
WHY DO YOU SAY
YOU WISH YOU COULD?

485
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,667
I'VE GOT TWO KIDS.

486
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,433
I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT.

487
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:29,533
EVERY TIME I THINK
ABOUT BUYING SOME,

488
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:32,700
I'M LIKE, "HOW? WHAT?"

489
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,967
THE LAST TIME
YOU DID MY SHOW AT UCB,

490
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,533
YOU STARTED TALKING
ABOUT HOW RIDICULOUS IT IS

491
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:39,500
FOR A GROWN MAN
TO STILL BE SMOKING POT

492
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:40,500
AND STILL BE--

493
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,500
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

494
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,267
YEAH, YOU WERE LIKE,
"COME ON.

495
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
IT'S TIME TO GROW UP."

496
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,200
WELL, YEAH.

497
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:47,933
YEAH, SEE?
YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY.

498
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:48,600
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

499
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,467
LOOK AT YOU.
IT'S SAD.

500
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,833
I DON'T THINK
YOU ACTUALLY SMOKED POT.

501
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:55,433
I THINK YOU SMOKED OREGANO,
AND YOU'RE TRYING--

502
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:58,433
LOOK AT ME; I'M ON
DAY TEN OF NOT SMOKING,

503
00:21:58,467 --> 00:21:59,467
AND I'M FINE.

504
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,900
YOU FEEL GREAT?

505
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,400
WELL, NO,
I DON'T FEEL GREAT.

506
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,567
I'D STILL LIKE TO DO IT.

507
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,533
REALLY? WOULD YOU?

508
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,533
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA.

509
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,533
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.

510
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:08,633
I HAVE TO.

511
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,133
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO DO IT EVERY DAY.

512
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,133
I'M GOING TO DO IT A LOT.

513
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,767
THEN I MIGHT NOT
LIKE IT ANYMORE AFTER THAT.

514
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,300
NO, I THINK YOU WON'T
LIKE IT AFTER A FEW DAYS.

515
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,600
PEOPLE SAY POT SMOKERS ARE LAZY.

516
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:19,300
I DISAGREE;
I'M A MULTITASKING POT SMOKER.

517
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,833
YEAH, JUST THE OTHER DAY,
I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET.

518
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:23,200
THAT'S ONE.

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,800
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE
THAT SECOND ONE BACK.

522
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,467
I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET.

523
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,867
I WAS PUTTING EYEDROPS
IN MY EYES.

524
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,833
I WAS TALKING ON MY CELL PHONE.

525
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:38,400
AND I WAS GETTING HIT BY A CAR.

CONGRATULATIONS.
BRAVO.

00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,233
CALLED THE MARIJUANA-LOGUES,

553
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:39,300
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,

554
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,367
IT'S LIKE THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES

555
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,000
BUT WITH POT
INSTEAD OF VAGINAS.

556
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,533
AND SOMETIMES
PEOPLE ARE OFFENDED.

557
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:47,367
THEY COME UP TO ME,
AND THEY'RE LIKE,

558
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,933
"ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF VAGINAS?

559
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:51,967
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH VAGINAS?"

560
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,267

WITH YOUR VAGINA.

573
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,300
DON'T DO IT, FELLAS.

WOW, I THINK I FOUND
THE PERFECT PLACE TO FART.

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,900
I THINK THAT--I THINK POT'S
ILLEGAL THERE, OVER THERE,

THAT WAY.

587
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,100
OR MAYBE THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

588
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:28,100
YEAH, POT IS LEGAL OVER THAT WAY
AND ILLEGAL THAT WAY.

TO DO IT, GO FOR IT.

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,867
THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M PREGNANT.

625
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,333
[laughter]

626
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:08,900
EVERY DAY IS A JOY

627
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:11,267
NOW THAT MY BABY'S COMING.

628
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,467
I RECENTLY SAW A DOG
IN A CAGE, AND--

629
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
HANG ON; THERE'S MORE.

630
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:27,367
AND THE CAGE HAD A SIGN ON IT
THAT SAID, "I BITE."

631
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,867
AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT IS GOOD
TO KNOW, DOGGIE,

632
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,067
"BUT THAT'S NOT THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING ABOUT YOU.

633
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,400
"YOU SHOULD MAKE
A SIGN THAT SAYS,

634
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:39,233
'I MAKE SIGNS.'"

635
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:42,133
[laughter]

636
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:45,400
(Cohan)
SO I'M GOING TO TEST
YOUR MEMORY,

637
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:48,067
AND I WANT YOU TO SAY
THESE WORDS BACK TO ME

638
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,467
AFTER I SAY ALL THREE.

639
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,467
IT'S THREE WORDS.

640
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,567
OKAY.

641
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,533
BOAT, CUCUMBER, WIRE.

642
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,167
BOAT, CUCUMBER,
WIRE?

643
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,267
JUST SAY IT BACK TO ME.

644
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,033
I LIKE TO PUT A QUESTION MARK
AT THE END.

645
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,000
THERE; YOU CAN ALWAYS
PUT A QUESTION MARK

646
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:04,167
AT THE END
OF ANYTHING YOU LIKE.

647
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,167
NOW,

648
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,133
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
CERTAIN THINGS.

649
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,700
I WANT YOU
TO ACTUALLY NAME THEM.

650
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:10,233
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS THING?

651
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:11,267
FANCY.

652
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,067
A WATCH.

653
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,133
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS THING?

654
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:15,533
A PEN.
ALL RIGHT.

655
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:20,167
I CAN'T WAIT TO TAKE THIS
WHEN I'M HIGH.

656
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,433
NOW, REMEMBER THOSE THREE WORDS
I ASKED YOU BEFORE

657
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,467
OR TOLD YOU BEFORE?

658
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,000
I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME--

659
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:26,133
SEE?
I KNEW IT.

660
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:28,800
TELL ME BACK.
IT WAS ONLY THREE WORDS.

661
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,333
I KNOW.

662
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:32,400
BOAT AND CUCUMBER.

663
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:34,467
OKAY.

664
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,267
THERE WAS A THIRD WORD.

665
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,100
I KNOW.
BOAT, CUCUMBER...

666
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:40,300
[whispers]
BOAT, CUCUMBER.

667
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,400
I DON'T KNOW THE THIRD ONE.

668
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,467
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT TWO OUT OF THREE.

669
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,267
IT WAS "WIRE."

670
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
WIRE.

671
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,300
OKAY.

672
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,233
NO WONDER.

673
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,733
REPEAT THIS AFTER ME,
GRAHAM.

674
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:51,733
BOAT, CUCUMBER, WIRE.

675
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,767
BOAT, CUCUMBER, WIRE.

676
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,533
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE GOOD TOO.

677
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:58,133
I'M NOT A STONER.

678
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,533
YOUR LUNGS GOT BETTER.

679
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:00,600
HOW MUCH BETTER?

680
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:02,633
3% IN 23 DAYS.

681
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:05,767
SO THAT'S--SO I'M AT 93%?

682
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,167
92%, SO--
WHICH IS ACTUALLY--

683
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,900
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT
INSUBSTANTIAL.

684
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:11,233
I MEAN, I CAN'T TELL YOU

685
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,000
IF IT'S STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT, BUT--

686
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:16,167
SEE, THAT MEMORY TEST--
I KNEW I WAS 89%

687
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,233
FROM THREE WEEKS AGO.

688
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:18,900
SO WHAT THREE WORDS
DID HE TELL YOU?

689
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:22,033
HE TOLD ME...

690
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,600
WIRE, BACON,
AND SOME OTHER ONE?

691
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:25,633
[laughs]

692
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:26,867
HE DID WORSE THAN I DID!

693
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,467
AND HE DOESN'T SMOKE POT
EVER.

694
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,267
OH, HEY, JIM.

695
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,000
I WAS HOPING THAT WAS YOU,

696
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:51,867
BUT I'M NOT PSYCHIC.

697
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,000
WELL, WE'LL FIND OUT
ABOUT THAT, WON'T WE?

698
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,633
WE'LL FIND OUT
HOW PSYCHIC I AM.

699
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:58,367
(Underdown)
I HAVE THE EXACT SAME DECK
OVER THERE.

700
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,167
WE'RE GOING TO FLIP A CARD UP,

701
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GUESS
WHICH ONE OF THE CARDS

702
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,800
WE'RE FLIPPING UP.

703
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,600
AND, TO MY KNOWLEDGE,

704
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:08,833
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
A TEST DONE BEFORE

705
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,000
WHICH COMPARES PSYCHIC ABILITY

706
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:13,733
BEFORE AND AFTER
THE INFLUENCE OF MARIJUANA.

707
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,133
IT'S GROUNDBREAKING, YEAH.

708
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,267
(Underdown)
IT'S GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH.

709
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,700
FIRST CARD,
EVERYBODY SEE THE FIRST CARD?

710
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,367
AND, DOUG, WHAT IS YOUR GUESS?

711
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,067
(Benson)
TRIANGLE.

712
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,700
(Underdown)
FIRST GUESS IS TRIANGLE.

713
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,833
WHAT'S YOUR GUESS?

714
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,067
CIRCLE.

715
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,000
CIRCLE IS THE GUESS.
OKAY.

716
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:40,733
PLUS...

717
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,633
SO THAT'S IT?

718
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,700
WE ONLY GOT ONE--
IS THAT RIGHT--THE WHOLE TIME?

719
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:47,333
1 HIT OUT OF 25, WOW.

720
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,567
(man)
SO YOU'RE NEGATIVE PSYCHIC.

721
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,067
YOU'RE SPECTACULARLY
NOT PSYCHIC.

722
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,167
SPECTACULARLY
UNPSYCHIC.

723
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,167
(Underdown)
YEAH.

724
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,200
WHAT ALLEGEDLY HAS HAPPENED
IS THAT A D.E.A. AGENT

725
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:08,733
TRIED TO GET IN
WITHOUT HIS PROPER CREDENTIALS,

726
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,300
AND THE SECURITY GUARD DID
WHAT HE'S PAID TO DO,

727
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,833
WHICH IS TO SAY,
"NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

728
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:13,967
GET OUT OF HERE."

729
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,200
IT WAS LED BY JOHN SMITH AGAIN.

730
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:17,100
(man)
THAT'S THE--

731
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:19,933
THE SAME GUY WHO'S BEEN TOLD
TO STOP DOING THIS

732
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:21,400
UNTIL CITY COUNCIL RECONVENES

733
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:22,867
AND WE PUT TOGETHER
AN ORDINANCE.

734
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,067
HE FEELS HE'S RAMBO AGAIN.

735
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,800
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
NBC SHOWED UP.

736
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,800
KTLA SHOWED UP.

737
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,133
THE D.E.A. IS STILL INSIDE.

738
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,067
(Benson)
THERE YOU GO!
THERE YOU GO!

739
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,767
THERE HE IS,
THE GREAT JOHN SMITH!

740
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,967
[people booing and applauding]

741
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,100
(Frye)
THIS IS CALIFORNIA, BABY.

742
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:42,967
WE VOTED THIS IN.
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME.

743
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,200
AND WE AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

744
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,533
(people chanting)
GO AWAY, D.E.A.!

745
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:50,767
GO AWAY, D.E.A.!
GO AWAY, D.E.A.!

746
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,833
(man)
YOU HIT HIM!

747
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:52,867
(woman)
OH, MY GOD!

748
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,133
[people yelling]

749
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,500
(man)
THAT'S CALLED HIT AND RUN!

750
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:58,167
(Frye)
YOU JUST HIT A PATIENT.

751
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:03,667
(man)
SPECIAL AGENT JOHN SMITH,
COME ON DOWN!

752
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,600
[people yelling]

753
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,633
(Frye)
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

754
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,133
(man)
WE HAVE NO DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES
INVOLVED IN THIS.

755
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:21,300
(man)
ARE THEY REALLY D.E.A.?

756
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,200
THEY'RE REAL D.E.A. OFFICERS,
AGENTS, YES.

757
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,733
AND JOHN SMITH'S
NOT UP THERE?

758
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:28,267
WE HAVE NO DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES
INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT.

759
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,733
(man)
SO JOHN SMITH'S NOT IN THERE.

760
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,300
NO.

761
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,800
(man)
AND HE'S NOT UP THERE EITHER?

762
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,300
ARE YOU SAYING JOHN SMITH
ISN'T UP THERE?

763
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,000
I KNOW JOHN SMITH,
OFFICER SMITH.

764
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,400
HE IS NOT THERE.

765
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:42,700
DOESN'T THE POLICE
OR ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL

766
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:47,633
THAT WANTS TO INVADE OUR SPACE
HAVE TO HAVE A WARRANT TO DO SO?

767
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,967
I'M NOT GOING
TO COMMENT ON THAT.

768
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
AND YOU WON'T COMMENT

769
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:52,867
ON WHETHER OR NOT
THEY HAVE A WARRANT.

770
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,500
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT
ON THAT.

771
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:56,433
(woman)
OFFICER, WILL YOU BE
LEAVING OFFICERS HERE?

772
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:59,533
(man)
IF THEY DON'T HAVE A WARRANT,
THEN THEY SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

773
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,567
OKAY.

774
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,567
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON
ITS NINTH HOUR.

775
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,567
WORD IS,
IS THAT THE D.E.A. LOCKSMITHS

776
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,367
THAT WERE HERE
THAT WE RAN AWAY

777
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,100
ARE GOING TO PROBABLY BE
COMING BACK.

778
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,867
THE ISSUES
THAT THEY'RE HAVING IS,

779
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,500
THEY NEED TO GET INTO THE SAFE,
APPARENTLY, THAT'S UPSTAIRS.

780
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,233
AND WE ALSO HAVE WORD THAT,
YEAH,

781
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,367
THEY DO HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT,
BUT GUESS WHAT?

782
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,300
THERE'S NO SIGNATURE ON IT.

783
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,967
(woman)
WHO SIGNED THE WARRANT?

784
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,767
WHAT JUDGE SIGNED THE WARRANT?

785
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,267
(man)
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW!

786
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,700
(Frye)
THIS IS WHY WE WAITED
ALL NIGHT:

787
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:38,367
BECAUSE WE KNEW
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

788
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,733
BUT THAT'S OKAY;
WE HAVE IT ON FILM.

789
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:42,967
(man)
GO BUST A METH LAB,
YOU PUSSIES.

790
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,133
(man)
GO DOWN THE STREET
AND DO YOUR JOB, MAN.

791
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,300
(woman)
THEIR JOB IS NOT
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

792
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,900
THEIR JOB IS TO GET THE HELL
OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

793
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:52,767
(Frye)
YUP.

794
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,633
(narrator)
SO ISN'T MARIJUANA LEGAL
IN CALIFORNIA?

795
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,900
WELL, IT IS,

796
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:05,233
BUT THE LAW IS NOT RECOGNIZED
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

797
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:08,500
TO EXPLAIN, THE TENTH AMENDMENT
TO THE BILL OF RIGHTS SAYS

798
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,867
THAT STATES HAVE THE RIGHT
TO GOVERN THEMSELVES

799
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,900
WITH REGARD TO POWERS
NOT GRANTED OR PROHIBITED

800
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,367
BY THE CONSTITUTION.

801
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,600
IN THE LAST CENTURY, MANY ISSUES
HAVE CHALLENGED THIS AMENDMENT,

802
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:21,733
INCLUDING ABORTION,
GAY MARRIAGE, AND GAMBLING.

803
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,500
AS OF TODAY,
FEDERAL ANTIDRUG LAWS

804
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:25,700
ARE IN DIRECT CONFLICT

805
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:28,567
WITH LAWS IN CALIFORNIA
AND SEVERAL OTHER STATES

806
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,467
THAT ALLOW PATIENTS LEGAL ACCESS
TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

807
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:43,533
BYE, SPACE NEEDLE.

808
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,467
SO...

809
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,867
CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN SOME ASSORTED NUTS?

810
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,567
[ticking]

811
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,033
(man)
WELL, THE WHOLE IDEA

812
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,900
WAS THAT I WOULD HELP FACILITATE
THE GROWTH OF SO MUCH MARIJUANA

813
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,433
THAT THE D.E.A. AND ALL THE
AGENCIES IN THE UNITED STATES

814
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,800
WOULD NEVER BE ABLE
TO DESTROY IT

815
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,533
AT THE RATE
I WOULD HELP CREATE IT

816
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,800
AND THAT, ULTIMATELY,
I, ONE MAN, WOULD NEUTRALIZE

817
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:10,900
THE WORK OF THE ENTIRE D.E.A.

818
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:13,367
WITH THEIR
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR BUDGET.

819
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,133
(man)
HE CALLS HIMSELF
THE PRINCE OF POT,

820
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:17,267
BUT HE MAY BECOME THE PRINCE
OF FEDERAL PRISON.

821
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,567
I JUST WAS WATCHING 60 MINUTES,

822
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,800
AND THERE'S, LIKE, A WHOLE STORY
ABOUT MARC EMERY...

823
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:23,267
PRINCE OF POT.

824
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,133
YEAH, AND HOW THEY WANT TO,
YOU KNOW,

825
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,333
EXTRADITE HIM AND ALL THAT.

826
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,533
THE GUY--I WOULD LOVE
TO INTERVIEW THAT GUY.

827
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,767
[upbeat sitar music]

828

*

829
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:49,500
SEE, 'CAUSE I HAVE THIS IDEA
THAT NONE OF THIS IS ANY GOOD

830
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:50,967
UNLESS YOU HAVE TO FACE
TEMPTATION.

831
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,533
[laughs]

832
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:58,333
I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S
NO VIRTUE WITHOUT TEMPTATION,

833
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,433
SO I JUST MAKE SURE--

834
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:02,733
I STILL GET
TO SMELL IT.

835
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:04,867
THAT'S ONE THING
THAT'S KIND OF NICE.

836
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,467
WELL, YOU SEE,
EVEN THAT'S GIVING IN

837
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,000
TO A LITTLE BIT OF IT
RIGHT THERE, EH?

838
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,700
SO I'M CORRUPTING YOU
JUST BY BEING IN THE PROXIMITY.

839
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:12,767
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,
I'VE SEEN MORE GROW ROOMS

840
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,600
THAN ANYBODY ELSE ALIVE
IN CANADA--I THINK 400 OR SO--

841
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:19,800
AND BEEN ARRESTED 22 TIMES,
JAILED 17 TIMES,

842
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:22,433
RAIDED 6 TIMES--
ALL FOR POT, NOTHING UNSAVORY.

843
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:24,367
YOU KNOW, I, IF ANYTHING,
HAVE A GOOD REASON

844
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,833
NEVER TO HAVE TO USE DRUGS,

845
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:27,300
AND, TYPICALLY,
I ONLY EXPERIMENT

846
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,700
WITH THE PSYCHEDELICS ONCE
EVERY SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR

847
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,067
AND SMOKE POT, RIGHT?

848
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,267
AND I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE
ANY DRUG DEPENDENCIES.

849
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,667
AND HAVING TREATED DRUG ADDICTS,

850
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,333
I CAN SEE WHAT--
BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

851
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:38,600
OF THE 65 PEOPLE I TREATED,
60 OF THEM

852
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:40,567
DID NOT HAVE THEIR
BIOLOGICAL FATHER IN THEIR LIFE

853
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,067
FOR ALL OR PART
OF THEIR CHILDHOOD,

854
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,300
AND THAT, I FOUND, WAS THE MOST
KEY, FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT

855
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,800
OF EVERY SINGLE DRUG ADDICT,
ALMOST,

856
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,867
IS THAT THEIR BIOLOGICAL FATHER
WAS NOT THERE

857
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,800
FOR A LOT
OF THEIR PREPUBESCENT LIFE.

858
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,733
I FOUND THAT POT MADE ME
MORE PATIENT.

859
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:56,700
IT MADE ME A MORE CREATIVE LOVER
AND A CREATIVE WRITER.

860
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:59,000
BUT IF YOU SMOKE POT,
YOU GET MORE EXPANSIVE.

861
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:00,600
EXPLANATIONS GET LONGER.

862
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:02,367
WE PAID FOR THE SUPREME COURT
CHALLENGE IN CANADA.

863
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,367
THEY GOT THE SUPREME COURT
TO TRY AND MAKE POT LEGAL.

864
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,733
WE LOST SIX TO THREE, RIGHT?

865
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:06,700
EVERYBODY WANTS TO FUCK.

866
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:07,733
AS SOON AS YOU DISCOVER...

867
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,067
LET ME DRINK YOUR THING.

868
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,600
DON'T WORRY; MY COLD SORES
AREN'T CONTAGIOUS.

869
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:11,633
THE THING ABOUT POT...

870
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:12,833
BUT I REMEMBER, FOR EXAMPLE,

871
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:14,200
WHEN I SHOT A PUCK
THROUGH A WINDOW...

872
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,333
I FOUND THAT IT WAS A LOT EASIER
TO RAISE KIDS AFTER A JOINT.

873
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,600
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE
IN INNER CITIES.

874
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:18,967
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
ENRICH OUR COMMUNITY

875
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,033
WITH MORE MONEY, MORE WEED,
MORE EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

876
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:23,367
ARE YOU
IN THE PERFORMANCE INDUSTRY?

877
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,200
YEAH, I'M A STAND-UP COMEDIAN.

878
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,367
HOLY CRAP.

879
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,500
I FEEL LIKE I WENT THROUGH
SOME SORT OF MARIJUANA GAUNTLET.

HOW CAN IT NOT BE AROUND?

00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,700

OUT THERE.

GO FIND THEM.

I'M NOT TALKING TO THAT CULT.

I'LL CALL WALSH.

887

HUEBEL'S PROBABLY
GOT SOME.

888
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,400

HAS GOT SOME.

THAT GUY'S GOT HELLA WEED.

890
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:01,933
HE'S TOTALLY SMOKING...

OR HE'S MAKING
A CELL PHONE CALL.

I'M A FRIEND OF DOUG BENSON'S.

893
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,633
I'VE NEVER SMOKED POT
IN MY LIFE.

894
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,867
I JUST NEVER DID IT.

895
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,267
NEVER--I'VE BEEN DRUNK ONCE

896

IN SEVENTH GRADE.

897
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:22,433
BUT I'VE BEEN TAKING
ANTIDEPRESSANTS FOR 12 YEARS.

898
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,967
SO I DO HAVE A LID ON IT.

THAT'S RIGHT; WE HAD TO EAT

I DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN.

I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD,

ARE THERE ANY POT SMOKERS HERE
TODAY?

923

ANY POT SMOKERS AT ALL?

IN YOUR LAST HOURS OF--
HOW URGENT--HOW--

926
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:29,833
IT'S--I DON'T FEEL--I DON'T FEEL
ANY URGENCY AT ALL.

927
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,733
SO DOES THAT--DOES THAT
BEG THE QUESTION

928
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:35,833
THAT MAYBE YOUR WHOLE EXISTENCE
IS A MISTAKE?

929
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:37,600
YEAH, IT'S A LIE.

930
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:39,367
SHUT UP.

00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,500
SHUT UP;
IT'S MY TOAST.

YES.

00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,567
I WAS INTERESTED IN YOU
AS IT IS.

1094
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,100
[laughs]

1095
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:22,200
YOU SEEM INTERESTED ENOUGH,

1096
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:24,000
BUT THAT'S--

1097
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:25,433
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT IT IS,

1098
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,333
IT'S YOUR JOB,
IS TO SEEM INTERESTED.

1099
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:30,367
SEE, THIS IS WHY I WOULDN'T EVER
PAY A THERAPIST,

1100
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,733
'CAUSE THEY FUCKING
MAKE YOU GO CRAZY.

1101
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:37,233
HE SAYS TO ME, HE GOES,
"WOULD YOU LIKE IT

1102
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:40,400
IF I SMOKED POT SOMETIME
BEFORE OUR SESSION?"

1103
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:42,833
AND THEN, WHEN YOU START
THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION

1104
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:45,333
WITH A THERAPIST,
IT JUST BECOMES HIM GOING,

1105
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:49,767
"WELL, DO YOU WANT ME TO THINK
THAT YOU THINK

1106
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,033
THAT I WANT YOU TO BE HIGH
WHILE I'M HIGH?"

1107
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:55,200
YOU KNOW,
IT GETS VERY CONVOLUTED,

1108
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:57,000
AND I WAS ALREADY FUCKING HIGH.

1109
00:47:57,033 --> 00:47:58,433
[laughter]

1110
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:00,367
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT HE WASN'T.

1111
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:02,867
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

1112
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,400
I FIND THIS PLACE THAT'S, LIKE,
RIGHT NEXT TO MY HOME,

1113
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:08,567
AND THEY'RE DOING IT
ON RELIGION.

1114
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,067
THEY'RE DISTRIBUTING POT
AS A RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT.

1115
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,267
SO YOU DON'T NEED
TO HAVE A--

1116
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,367
SO YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
A LICENSE.

1117
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,100
YOU JUST GO IN AND BUY IT.

1118
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:17,100
OKAY, GOT TO BE SERIOUS.

1119
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:19,400
THIS IS CHURCH.
IT'S TIME FOR CHURCH.

1120
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:20,900
IN REVELATION,
IT TALKS ABOUT A PLANT

1121
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:23,633
FOR THE HEALING OF ALL NATIONS,
WHICH CANNABIS IS.

1122
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,500
SO WE'RE SELLING WEED
FOR THE LORD

1123
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:26,833
ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.

1124
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:30,767
ALL RIGHT, WELCOME
TO TEMPLE 420 SERVICES TODAY.

1125
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,767
EVERYONE, DOUG BENSON
WAS ON LAST COMIC STANDING,

1126
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,700
AND WE INVITED HIM TO COME
THE OTHER EVENING

1127
00:48:35,733 --> 00:48:38,067
TO OUR COMEDY.

1128
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,433
BUT HE WASN'T SURE, BECAUSE
HE DOESN'T FULLY BELIEVE IN GOD,

1129
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:43,633
SO HE'S HERE TO COME
TO THESE SERVICES

1130
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,733
AND CHECK OUT TEMPLE 420,
OUR 420 SERVICES.

1131
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,400
(Silverman)
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN GOD?

1132
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:50,267
(Benson)
HE SAID IT SO MATTER-OF-FACTLY.

1133
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,700
"AND HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN GOD."

1134
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:54,100
SO, EVERYBODY, THERE'S GOING
TO BE PUNCH, AND"--

1135
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:55,133
(Craig X)
THERE WILL BE PUNCH.

1136
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,133
DO THE ATHEISTS
GET PUNCH?

1137
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,267
THE ATHEIST
GETS PUNCH TOO,

1138
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,733
RIGHT IN THE FACE,
WITH THE TRUTH.

1139
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,867
[laughter]

1140
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,000
IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
TO OUR TEMPLE BEFORE,

1141
00:49:06,033 --> 00:49:08,200
WE'LL JUST LET YOU KNOW
WE'RE A JUDEO-CHRISTIAN TEMPLE.

1142
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:09,567
YOU HAPPEN TO BE ON SATURDAY,

1143
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,567
SO WE HAVE THE OLD TESTAMENT,
JEW-Y THING GOING ON.

1144
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,633
IF YOU COME BACK TOMORROW,

1145
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:17,167
WE GOT THE NEW TESTAMENT,
ALL RIGHT?

1146
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,267
SO FEEL FREE TO COME BACK
ANY DAY.

1147
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,967
SERVICES ARE ALWAYS AT 4:20.

1148
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,467
I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A JOKE,

1149
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,433
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK ANY
OF THE MATERIAL UP HERE TODAY

1150
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:28,767
HAS BEEN AIMED
AT YOU SPECIFICALLY.

1151
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,400
I THINK YOU'LL REALLY
ENJOY THIS JOKE.

1152
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:33,367
WHY DID
THE LITTLE STRAWBERRY CRY?

1153
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:39,267
BECAUSE HIS MOTHER
WAS IN A JAM.

1154
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,167
[laughs]
COME ON.

1155
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,933
AND THEN THEY PUT WEED IN,
AND EVERYBODY GOT REALLY HIGH.

1156
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:45,000
SO, ANYWAY...

1157
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:47,400
[laughter]

1158
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:50,833
SO THIS GUY HAS SERVICES
EVERY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY

1159
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:54,367
AT 4:20, RIGHT?

1160
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,767
AND WE WENT TODAY, AND IT WAS--

1161
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
I BROUGHT, LIKE,
THREE OR FOUR FRIENDS,

1162
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:00,500
AND THEN THERE WERE
SOME CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND

1163
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:02,900
AND A COUPLE OTHER DUDES.

1164
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:08,567
AND THERE WAS A WHOLE SERVICE
BUILT AROUND WHY, YOU KNOW--

1165
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,733
SINCE THE LORD IS GOOD
AND WE LOVE THE LORD,

1166
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:15,967
WEED.

1167
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:20,667
[alarm beeping]

1168
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:31,400
[soft rock music]

1169
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:33,467
(man)
* I'M FEELING OLDER.

1170
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,167
* A DIFFERENT TIME,
ANOTHER SHOW. *

1171
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,867
THAT'S REAL NICE.

1172
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,500
THAT'S REAL GOOD.

1173
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:49,500
I ALREADY SEE A STAR
IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST ONE.

1174
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:50,867
I'M ALREADY FEELING IT.

1175
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,700
(Underdown)
AND, DOUG, WHAT'S YOUR GUESS?

1176
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:58,000
I'M GOING TO GUESS STAR.

1177
00:50:58,033 --> 00:50:59,000
(Underdown)
FIRST GUESS IS STAR.

1178
00:50:59,033 --> 00:51:02,667
SECOND CARD.

1179
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,933
HOLDING IT UP.

1180
00:51:03,967 --> 00:51:06,667
(Benson)
I'M GOING TO GUESS SQUARE.

1181
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,400
(Underdown)
SQUARE.

1182
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:12,133
THIRD GUESS.
HOLD IT UP.

1183
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,700
TRIANGLE.

1184
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:15,700
FOURTH GUESS.

1185
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:19,167
HOLD IT UP.

1186
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,967
(Benson)
CIRCLE.

1187
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,800
(Underdown)
SEVEN RIGHT THIS TIME.

1188
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:28,433
THE FIRST TIME,
YOU GOT ONE RIGHT.

1189
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:30,933
SO YOU'VE DONE
SEVEN TIMES BETTER.

1190
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:35,667
HOWEVER, SINCE YOU ONLY GOT 7
OUT OF 25, YOU DON'T--

1191
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,267
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF PSYCHIC ABILITY.

1192
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,833
(Escalante)
HOW ABOUT MEDICAL PROSTITUTION?

1193
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:56,967
'CAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN,

1194
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,433
AND I'D LIKE TO--
I DON'T SMOKE POT,

1195
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,967
AND I'LL JOIN YOUR FIGHT
IF YOU'LL JOIN MINE.

1196
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,267
YOU'LL--YEAH, I'LL JOIN
YOUR FIGHT.

1197
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,333
THAT'S AN AWESOME FIGHT.

1198
00:52:05,367 --> 00:52:07,600
WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT
PROSTITUTES?

1199
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:09,233
LIKE, I'M HAVING TROUBLE
FOLLOWING THIS;

1200
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:10,267
I SMOKE A LOT OF POT.

1201
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,433
MEDICAL PROSTITUTION,
JUST FOR--I NEED--

1202
00:52:12,467 --> 00:52:13,633
I REALIZE
PROSTITUTION IS ILLEGAL,

1203
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:16,800
BUT I NEED IT
FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES.

1204
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,067
I THINK MARIJUANA'S

1205
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,733
A MUCH, MUCH, MUCH MORE
VICTIMLESS CRIME

1206
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:21,633
THAN PROSTITUTION,
'CAUSE, UNFORTUNATELY,

1207
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:22,833
THE WOMEN THAT DO
THE PROSTITUTING

1208
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:26,967
GOT THERE SOMEHOW
THAT WAS PROBABLY TERRIBLE.

1209
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,133
AND YOU SHOULD TALK TO THE GUY
THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW

1210
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:30,367
TO GET THE PROSTITUTE TOO.

1211
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,833
HE'S WAY WORSE THAN YOUR GUY.

1212
00:52:31,867 --> 00:52:34,067
IT'S--YEAH, MY GUY'S NEVER--

1213
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,833
I'VE NEVER HAD A DEALER
SLAP ME AROUND...

1214
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:37,867
(woman)
NOT YET.

1215
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,200
AND TELL ME TO WAIT IN THE CAR.

1216
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,633
(man)
WELCOME TO MINNEAPOLIS.

1217
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:52,133
THANKS.

1218
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:03,100
WHAT'S THE PROPER WAY
TO ADDRESS YOU? SENATOR?

1219
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,300
THAT OR JOHN OR--
I DON'T CARE; WHATEVER YOU WISH.

1220
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:08,667
SENATOR JOHN.

1221
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,533
I BELIEVE YOU'RE
THE FIRST POLITICIAN

1222
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:14,867
THAT'S BEEN WILLING TO SPEAK
ON CAMERA

1223
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,233
ABOUT THIS SUBJECT.

1224
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:17,067
I WAS CO-AUTHOR

1225
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,233
OF SEVERAL
MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILLS

1226
00:53:19,267 --> 00:53:22,267
JUST BECAUSE I SEE AND TALK
TO ENOUGH PEOPLE

1227
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,333
WHO WERE USING IT

1228
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,333
FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES.

1229
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:26,800
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I PROBABLY--

1230
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:30,333
PERFECT EXAMPLE OF ONE
WHO NEVER TRIED A CIGARETTE,

1231
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:32,767
NEVER SMOKED A JOINT,

1232
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,467
HASN'T DONE SO
AND DON'T INTEND TO DO SO.

1233
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,633
AND I JUST THINK THAT THE IDEA

1234
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:39,200
THAT GOVERNMENT IS GOING
TO STEP IN THERE

1235
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:41,800
AND TELL EVERY DOCTOR
AND EVERY PATIENT,

1236
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:42,967
NO MATTER HOW HARD
THEY'RE HURTING,

1237
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,500
THAT "WE'RE NOT GOING
TO LET YOU DO THIS

1238
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:47,033
"BECAUSE WE HAVE
THIS OTHER FEAR

1239
00:53:47,067 --> 00:53:48,933
THAT'S NOTHING RELATED
TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING."

1240
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:51,767
IF YOU SEE, IF YOU TALK
WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S SUFFERING

1241
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,667
AND THEY--YOU KNOW,
THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE,

1242
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,000
I DON'T CARE
WHAT FEAR YOU HAVE;

1243
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:58,733
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU GOT
TO TRY AND DO THE RIGHT THING.

1244
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:01,300
PEOPLE THAT NEED MARIJUANA,
THEY'RE NOT DOING IT

1245
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:04,733
BECAUSE IT'S FUN,
IT'S ENJOYABLE, IT'S EXCITING.

1246
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:09,000
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT NO OTHER MEDICATION,

1247
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:13,200
WHETHER PRESCRIBABLE OR NOT,
CAN DELIVER WHAT MARIJUANA DOES

1248
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:16,133
AND CAN PROVIDE ME
WITH THE QUALITY OF LIFE.

1249
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:19,733
WELL, THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT
WAS WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY 17.

1250
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:21,233
I DIDN'T TRY IT ANY EARLIER
THAN THAT.

1251
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:23,700
AND I JUST--THE FIRST TIME
I WENT THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY

1252
00:54:23,733 --> 00:54:25,167
WAS WHEN I WAS 17.

1253
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,900
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY MY MOM
AND MY BEST FRIEND AT THE TIME

1254
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:34,300
GOT ME A LITTLE BAG AND SAID,
"DO IT."

1255
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:39,533
AND IT HELPED TREMENDOUSLY,
LIKE, WITH ANXIETY, WITH PAIN,

1256
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,567
WITH EVERYTHING.

1257
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,667
PERSONALLY, I LOOK AT YOU GUYS,

1258
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,533
AND I SAY YOU DON'T NEED IT,
RIGHT?

1259
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:47,800
BUT I'M NOT A DOCTOR, OKAY?

1260
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,467
IF YOU WENT TO A DOCTOR

1261
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,900
AND A DOCTOR HAS SAT DOWN
WITH YOU

1262
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:54,700
AND HE'S WILLING TO PUT
HIS LICENSE ON THE LINE

1263
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:56,867
TO SAY THAT YOU GUYS NEED IT,

1264
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,833
NOBODY ELSE CAN TELL YOU
WHETHER YOU NEED IT OR NOT

1265
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:03,900
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE YOU NEED IT.

1266
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:07,833
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY REASON
PEOPLE ACCEPT ME FOR USING IT

1267
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:10,433
IS 'CAUSE THEY SEE ME
IN A CHAIR.

1268
00:55:15,633 --> 00:55:16,333
EXHIBIT "A."

1269
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:18,267
EXHIBIT "B."

1270
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,000
EXHIBIT "C."

1271
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:24,033
[laughs]

1272
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:27,867
(man)
* NO MORE WILL I BE AFRAID.

1273
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,433
(Benson)
THERE'S A COMMERCIAL ON NOW--

1274
00:55:30,467 --> 00:55:31,833
IT'S THE ABSOLUTE WORST ONE--

1275
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:34,567
WHERE A YOUNG TEENAGED
LADY, GIRL

1276
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,500
IS MELTING INTO A COUCH.

1277
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,267
SHE'S PHYSICALLY MELTING.

1278
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,433
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

1279
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:41,533
HER BODY IS TRANSFORMING.

1280
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,233
SHE'S LIKE:

1281
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:52,867
SHE'S MELTING, AND THERE'S
A GIRL SITTING NEXT TO HER GOES,

1282
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,567
"SHE SMOKES POT."

1283
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,500
[laughter]

1284
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:57,800
"THIS IS WHAT SHE'S BEEN LIKE

1285
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:00,600
"EVER SINCE
SHE STARTING SMOKING POT.

1286
00:56:00,633 --> 00:56:02,200
THIS IS ALL WE EVER DO."

1287
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:04,333
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THE GIRL WHO DOESN'T SMOKE POT,

1288
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:06,400
NOT EXACTLY THE MOST FUCKING
SPARKLING PERSONALITY

1289
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:07,333
IN THE WORLD.

1290
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,500
HOW MUCH OF A LOSER
DO YOU HAVE TO BE

1291
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:13,000
TO BE THE PERSON THAT'S
MORE BORING THAN THE STONER

1292
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:14,867
AND HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO

1293
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,800
THAN SIT
AND WATCH THE STONER MELT

1294
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,300
AND NOT EVEN FUCKING CALL 911...

1295
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,567
[laughter]

1296
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:28,267
OR EVEN 411 TO SAY, "I'VE GOT
SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION"?

1297
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,000
[laughs]

1298
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:35,233
SO THE GIRL'S MELTING
INTO THE COUCH.

1299
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,633
LET'S PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

1300
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:38,867
THE GIRL'S MELTING.

1301
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,867
AND, AS A POT SMOKER,
I'M NOT DETERRED.

1302
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,400
I'M WATCHING THAT COMMERCIAL
GOING,

1303
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:44,633
"HOW DO I GET A HOLD
OF SOME OF THAT WEED?"

1304
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,600
[laughter]

1305
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:49,600
"THAT IS SOME AMAZING SHIT

1306
00:56:49,633 --> 00:56:53,300
"THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TRY.

1307
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:57,067
"I HAVE BEEN SMOKING
THE CAN'T-FIND-MY-KEYS WEED,

1308
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,267
"AND SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD,

1309
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,333
"THERE IS SOME
MELTING-INTO-THE-COUCH SHIT.

1310
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:04,667
"THAT WOULD BE
AN INCREDIBLE RIDE.

1311
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:08,300
"PLUS, IF I MELT INTO THE COUCH,
MAYBE I'D FIND MY KEYS.

1312
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:13,633
IT WOULD BE
A WIN-WIN SITUATION."

1313
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:17,833
SO THIS IS WHAT ONE GUY GAVE ME
LAST NIGHT,

1314
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:23,067
THIS REALLY NICE FELLOW

1315
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,733
WHO SAID HE HEARD ME
ON THE RADIO YESTERDAY MORNING,

1316
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:27,567
AND HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND
WERE LIKE,

1317
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,400
"WE HAVE TO GO SEE HIM."

1318
00:57:29,433 --> 00:57:35,800
THIS, I GOT FROM SOMEONE ELSE
WHO DOES NOT WANT TO BE NAMED.

1319
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:39,067
AND THIS ONE, I GOT
FROM SOMEONE--

1320
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,867
YET A THIRD PARTY
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE NAMED.

1321
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,133
AND WE JUST MADE A BLEND
OF ALL THREE

1322
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:48,933
AND ENJOYED IT BEFORE OUR DAY
AT MALL OF AMERICA.

1323
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:54,500
[rock music]

1324
00:57:54,533 --> 00:58:02,567
*

1325
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:13,400
LAST TIME I WAS HERE
IN BEAUTIFUL MINNEAPOLIS,

1326
00:58:13,433 --> 00:58:17,833
I, YOU KNOW, WENT TO GO GET
MY FLIGHT OUT ON SUNDAY,

1327
00:58:17,867 --> 00:58:19,233
AND I'M WALKING
AROUND THE TERMINAL.

1328
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:22,167
I CAN'T FIND MY GATE,
CAN'T FIND MY GATE.

1329
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,200
HOURS GO BY, HOURS.

1330
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:28,800
AND THEN I FINALLY REALIZE
I'M AT MALL OF AMERICA.

1331
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,367
[laughter]

1332
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,500
I WROTE THAT JOKE TODAY
WHEN I WAS HIGH

1333
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:34,000
AT MALL OF AMERICA.

1334

THIS IS THE BROWNIE PORTION
OF THE EXAM.

[bell dings]

1337
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,700
I'M TOTALLY GOING TO LOSE
A LOT OF POINTS

1338
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:56,867
FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO OPEN IT.

1339
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,467
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND NOT TRY.

1340
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,367
UH!

HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING?

1343
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,900
WHAT HAS YOUR MOOD BEEN LIKE
IN THE LAST WEEK?

1344
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:25,000
MOSTLY GOOD.

1345
00:59:25,033 --> 00:59:26,533
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
YOUR MOOD

1346
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:27,767
AS EUPHORIC?

1347

CAN GET HIGH
IN THE AUDIENCE...

00:59:43,533 --> 00:59:47,000
AND TRY TO GET
THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU HIGH.

THIS IS ALREADY PACKED, SO--

OH, YOU WANT
TO GET HER HIGH.

OKAY, SO--

1369
01:00:17,233 --> 01:00:20,300
OKAY, DOUG'S GOING TO GET
A LITTLE MORE HIGH.

1370
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,933
THAT WAS
A PRETTY BIG HIT THERE.

1371
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:28,267
YOU MAY HAVE YOUR SENSIBILITIES
OFFENDED RIGHT NOW,

1372

BUT YOU ARE NOT
BEING MADE TO SMOKE DOPE.

WE'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD
VENTILATION SYSTEM.

IT'S MOSTLY GOING UP.

UPSTAIRS, THEY'LL BE
COMPLETELY HIGH.

THAT'S A POUND OF GRASS.

1399
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,533
MARIJUANA.

1400
01:01:22,567 --> 01:01:23,800
VOLCANOES.

1401
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:24,533
MARIJUANA.

1402
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:25,700
WHO CAUSED HURRICANE KATRINA?

1403
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:28,533
MARIJUANA!

1404
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:30,200
WHY DO PEOPLE
BECOME JEWISH?

1405
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:33,533
MARIJUANA.

1406
01:02:00,233 --> 01:02:05,000
[man over intercom]
SAN BRUNO.
THIS STATION IS SAN BRUNO.

1407
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:10,167
(man)
SO, WELL, ANYWAY,
WELCOME TO OAKSTERDAM.

1408
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,767
(Benson)
THANK YOU. I LOVE IT.

1409
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,833
ISN'T IT AWESOME?

1410
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:15,100
IT'S REALLY GREAT.

1411
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:20,967
I USUALLY DESCRIBE IT AS...

1412
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,633
THE COUNTERCULTURAL VISION
OF DOWNTOWN REDEVELOPMENT

1413
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:28,300
FOR OAKLAND.

1414
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:29,867
MY NAME'S RICHARD LEE,

1415
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,567
AND I'M THE OWNER
OF THE BULLDOG COFFEE SHOP

1416
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,800
AND THE OAKSTERDAM GIFT SHOP

1417
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,633
AND THE PUBLISHER
OF THE OAKSTERDAM NEWS.

1418
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:39,433
THIS WAS THE FIRST PLACE,
SO IT'S MATURED,

1419
01:02:39,467 --> 01:02:42,833
AND THINGS ARE--YOU KNOW,
THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE

1420
01:02:42,867 --> 01:02:43,767
TO ISSUE PERMITS.

1421
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,533
SO I THINK
IT'S A LOT MORE MATURE

1422
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:46,900
THAN THE OTHER PLACES
THAT ARE JUST NOW GETTING CLUBS

1423
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,400
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1424
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,700
IF YOU TRY TO FIGURE OUT
THE OVERALL CANNABIS MARKET...

1425
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:52,833
(narrator)
ANALYSTS RANK CANNABIS

1426
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:55,633
AS THE NUMBER ONE CASH CROP
IN AMERICA,

1427
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:58,000
WELL ABOVE COTTON, WHEAT,
AND TOBACCO,

1428
01:02:58,033 --> 01:03:00,533
WITH CALIFORNIA RESPONSIBLE
FOR ONE-THIRD

1429
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:02,667
OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY'S
CANNABIS SUPPLY.

1430
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,367
IN 2006 ALONE, ESTIMATED SALES
FROM CALIFORNIA CANNABIS

1431
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,067
EXCEEDED $12 BILLION.

1432
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,800
IF TAXED, THESE SALES
COULD HAVE EASILY GENERATED

1433
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:17,133
OVER $1 BILLION
IN GOVERNMENT REVENUE.

1434
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:20,700
IT'S, LIKE, GOING TO BE
THE NEW LOTTERY FOR CALIFORNIA.

1435
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:23,133
EXACTLY, THAT'S WHAT I THINK
IT'S GOING TO BE, EVENTUALLY.

1436
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,567
IT'S GOING TO BE
A LOT LIKE GAMBLING.

1437
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,767
(man)
SR-71 IS THE FIRST
STEALTH AIRPLANE,

1438
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,033
SO WE LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELF
AS A STEALTH COFFEE SHOP

1439
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:32,567
FLYING BELOW THE FEDERAL RADAR.

1440
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,533
WE HAVE OUR MEDIUM OVER HERE
ON OUR SECOND PAGE.

1441
01:03:34,567 --> 01:03:35,533
WE JUST KEEP OUT ONE MEDIUM
AT A TIME,

1442
01:03:35,567 --> 01:03:37,933
JUST USUALLY MEDIUM-
AND HIGH-GRADE.

1443
01:03:37,967 --> 01:03:39,767
WE GOT OUR PRICES RIGHT HERE
NEXT TO THE WEIGHTS

1444
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,600
SO YOU KIND OF KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH.

1445
01:03:41,633 --> 01:03:43,367
WE KEEP ALL THREE HIGH-GRADES
AT A TIME.

1446
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,167
YOU CAN ALWAYS FEEL FREE
TO TAKE THEM OUT.

1447
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,500
YOU CAN SMELL THEM,
SQUEEZE THEM,

1448
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:48,933
WHATEVER HELPS YOU MAKE
A DECISION.

1449
01:04:02,867 --> 01:04:06,767
LET ME ASK--YOU GOING
TO SMOKE A SPLIFF, MA'AM?

1450
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,967
ALL RIGHT.

1451
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,133
DO WE HAVE ANY MARIJUANA SMOKERS
HERE IN THE PARK TODAY?

1452
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:14,267
[scattered cheers and applause]

1453
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,200
ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
HERE IN THE PARK TODAY?

1454
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:18,400
[laughter]

1455
01:04:18,433 --> 01:04:20,633
I ASKED THOSE
IN THE WRONG ORDER.

1456
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,567
(Glazier)
I'M A GARDENER, A LANDSCAPER,

1457
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,467
SO I LIKE TO HELP
AIDS AND CANCER PATIENTS

1458
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,067
GROW THEIR OWN MEDICINE

1459
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,033
TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN

1460
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:33,533
AND TO JUST DECENTRALIZE
THE WHOLE ECONOMY.

1461
01:04:33,567 --> 01:04:35,667
WELL, OAKSTERDAM IS BASICALLY
A PRIVATE JOKE

1462
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,400
THAT A FEW AIDS PATIENTS
USED TO CHUCKLE ABOUT

1463
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:40,267
WHEN THE FIRST MARIJUANA CLUB
CAME HERE.

1464
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,600
AND MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE
ARE NOW DEAD.

1465
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:45,667
MOST OF THE ORIGINAL PATIENTS
FROM OAKSTERDAM HAVE DIED.

1466
01:04:49,767 --> 01:04:53,233
IT'S CALLED
INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC ACID.

1467
01:04:53,267 --> 01:04:55,700
IT'S BASICALLY--IT'S A HORMONE.

1468
01:04:55,733 --> 01:04:58,433
WHAT IT DOES IS,
IT SOFTENS UP THE PLANT TISSUE,

1469
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:00,967
AND IT SORT OF STERILIZES IT
AT THE SAME TIME.

1470
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,800
AND WHAT'LL HAPPEN IS,
AFTER A FEW DAYS,

1471
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:09,433
THE TISSUE'S SOFT,
AND LITTLE ROOTS WILL PUSH OUT,

1472
01:05:09,467 --> 01:05:13,833
AND IT BECOMES
ITS OWN LITTLE PLANT.

1473
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:15,700
THESE WERE TAKEN ON THE 15th.
TODAY'S THE 22nd.

1474
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:20,567
SO IN SEVEN DAYS,
WE HAVE CREATED LIFE.

1475
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,967
SO YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN INDICA OVER THERE

1476
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,133
AND SATIVA HERE.

1477
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:25,133
THIS ONE'S INDICA?

1478
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:26,000
RIGHT.

1479
01:05:26,033 --> 01:05:28,233
SEE, SHORT, SQUAT.
BIG, FAT LEAVES.

1480
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:31,867
THIS IS TALL,
MORE BRANCHY.

1481
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,067
THINNER LEAF.

1482
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,267
THIS IS ACTUALLY A HYBRID;
IT'S NOT PURE SATIVA.

1483
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,467
IF IT WAS PURE SATIVA,

1484
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,067
IT'D BE EVEN THINNER
AND BLANKIER.

1485
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,233
THE WORST MOVIE TO SEE
WHEN YOU'RE HIGH,

1486
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:43,167
THE WORST ONE EVER, I THINK,
IS A MOTION PICTURE

1487
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,433
CALLED SUPER HIGH ME.

1488
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:47,767
WHAT THE FUCK?

1489
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,700
I JUST FUCKED UP MY OWN JOKE.

1490
01:05:48,733 --> 01:05:51,667
SUPER SIZE ME--
FORGET--

1491
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,200
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY.

1492
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:57,033
[cheers and applause]

1493
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,133
MARIJUANA PEACE WAS
A LOT OF THINGS.

1494
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:13,600
THIS IS DENNIS PERON,

1495
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:15,567
FOUNDER OF THE MEDICAL
MARIJUANA CLUB MOVEMENT

1496
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,567
AND MANY, MANY THINGS.

1497
01:06:27,033 --> 01:06:29,367
APRIL 14, 1994.

1498
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,500
I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS DAY,
'CAUSE THE DAY BEFORE,

1499
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:32,967
YOU CALLED US ALL UP AND SAID,

1500
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,267
"WE'RE GOING TO GET ARRESTED
TOMORROW."

1501
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,567
(Peron)
THE CHIEF OF POLICE
HAD CALLED ME THAT DAY,

1502
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,200
SAID HE WAS GOING IN,
BUSTING US.

1503
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:39,033
I SAYS, "LOOK, CHIEF.

1504
01:06:39,067 --> 01:06:41,367
"YOU CAN COME IN.
YOU CAN BUST US.

1505
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,133
"BUT YOU REMEMBER STONEWALL?

1506
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:44,967
"THESE PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO FIGHT BACK.

1507
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,333
THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING
TO LAY DOWN."

1508
01:06:47,367 --> 01:06:48,700
IN THE END, WE KNEW WE'D WIN,

1509
01:06:48,733 --> 01:06:51,733
AND IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT WE WROTE IT FOR THE PEOPLE,

1510
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:53,433
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE--

1511
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:55,633
IT'S GOT A LOT OF HOLES IN IT,
THEY SAY.

1512
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:58,333
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
IT'S VERY LOOSELY WORDED.

1513
01:06:58,367 --> 01:06:59,733
(Shaw)
PIONEER LAW.

1514
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:02,333
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY,
"ALMOST ANYBODY CAN GET IT

1515
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:03,433
"WITH THIS LAW.

1516
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:05,267
DON'T VOTE FOR IT," BUT...

1517
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,933
IT WAS DONE IN THE NAME
OF MY DEAD FRIEND,

1518
01:07:08,967 --> 01:07:11,100
MY DEAD BROTHERS AND SISTERS
WHO DIED OF AIDS.

1519
01:07:11,133 --> 01:07:13,367
OUT OF ALL THAT PAIN,
ALL THAT SORROW,

1520
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,567
SOMETHING GOOD WOULD HAPPEN.

1521
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,567
THAT HAD TO BE
THE SUM OF THEIR LIFE,

1522
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,033
THAT THE WORLD CHANGED.

1523
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:24,400
(Benson)
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF COMEDIANS

1524
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:25,800
WORK REALLY HARD
ON THEIR JOKES.

1525
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,933
BUT WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING...

1526
01:07:27,967 --> 01:07:31,267
[laughter]

1527
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,300
IS SMOKING A LOT OF POT.

1528
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:37,700
SO I'VE BEEN HIGH, PROBABLY,
ABOUT 22 HOURS--

1529
01:07:37,733 --> 01:07:40,800
NO, NOT--
WELL, MORE LIKE 18 HOURS A DAY.

1530
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:43,600
I PROBABLY GET SOBER
DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

1531
01:07:43,633 --> 01:07:44,833
FOR A FEW HOURS.

1532
01:07:44,867 --> 01:07:47,533
AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING
TO PROVE NOTHING.

1533
01:07:47,567 --> 01:07:49,767
[laughter]

1534
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,067
AND WEIRD LAUGHS
IN THE AUDIENCE.

1535
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,600
"HA HA!

1536
01:07:54,633 --> 01:07:57,500
"HA HA!

1537
01:07:57,533 --> 01:07:58,800
"AH!

1538
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:03,567
"THIS GUY'S LIVING
IN A CARTOON WORLD.

1539
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,500
"HE'S GOT A CARTOON APARTMENT.

1540
01:08:07,533 --> 01:08:11,467
HA HA!"

1541
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,867
MUIR WOODS,
NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO,

1542
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,767
HOME OF THE MIGHTY REDWOOD.

1543
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:32,367
LET'S ENJOY IT TOGETHER,
SHALL WE?

1544
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
THEY REALLY TOOK THE TREAT
OUT OF RICE CRISPY TREAT.

1545
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:46,567
THIS THING TASTES HORRIBLE.

1546
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,733
HOW'S IT GOING?

1547
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,867
(man)
EXPRESS YOURSELF THERE.

1548
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,267
FUCK THIS FIRST AMENDMENT AREA.

1549
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,500
[laughter]

1550
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:06,200
I KNOW THIS GUY WHO HAS A DOG
THAT CAN TALK.

1551
01:09:06,233 --> 01:09:08,267
YOU CAN ASK--
YOU CAN ASK THE DOG--

1552
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,133
[laughter]

1553
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:12,033
YOU CAN ASK--
THIS IS SERIOUS.

1554
01:09:12,067 --> 01:09:14,767
YOU CAN ASK THE DOG
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

1555
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,833
AND THEN IT'LL ANSWER,
TALKING-STYLE.

1556
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:22,700
SO I GO--I GO--

1557
01:09:22,733 --> 01:09:24,600
I GO, "WHAT'S THE THING
ON TOP OF A HOUSE?"

1558
01:09:24,633 --> 01:09:28,233
AND THE DOG GOES, "ROOF!"

1559
01:09:28,267 --> 01:09:30,900
I'M LIKE, "OKAY,

1560
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:32,600
WHO'S THE GREATEST
BASEBALL PLAYER OF ALL TIME?"

1561
01:09:32,633 --> 01:09:36,767
AND THE DOG GOES, "RUTH!"

1562
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,567
I'M LIKE, "OKAY, THAT'S GOOD."

1563
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,733
NAME A TOURIST ATTRACTION
IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA.

1564
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:45,267
"WHARF!"

1565
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,633
[laughter]

1566
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:47,933
AND THEN I'M LIKE,
"BE MORE SPECIFIC."

1567
01:09:47,967 --> 01:09:51,233
"FISHERMAN'S WHARF!"

1568
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:54,467
[laughter]

1569
01:10:15,533 --> 01:10:18,767
THIS IS DAY 23 OF A PROJECT
THAT I'M WORKING ON

1570
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,100
CALLED SUPER HIGH ME.

1571
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:26,467
I'M SMOKING POT
ALL DAY EVERY DAY FOR 30 DAYS,

1572
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,900
STARTING FROM WHEN
I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

1573
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,733
TO WHEN I GO TO BED AT NIGHT.

1574
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:34,200
AND IT HAS BEEN AWESOME.

1575
01:10:34,233 --> 01:10:36,567
[laughter]

1576
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,767
I THINK--YOU KNOW WHAT?

1577
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,933
I THINK THIS MONTH
THAT YOU WEREN'T STONED,

1578
01:10:40,967 --> 01:10:44,033
I THINK YOU HAVE
A POT GLAND IN YOUR BODY NOW,

1579
01:10:44,067 --> 01:10:46,667
AND IT JUST RELEASES POT
WHEN YOU GO WITHOUT.

1580
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,833
YOU HAVE--IT'S LIKE
A CAMEL HUMP,

1581
01:10:47,867 --> 01:10:49,467
AND YOU DON'T SEE IT.

1582
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,867
AND SO THE WHOLE FUCKING MOVIE,
YOU'RE JUST STONED.

1583
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,100
IT'S JUST

1584
01:10:53,133 --> 01:10:54,600
SUPER HIGH ME
FOR 60 GODDAMN DAYS,

1585
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:57,933
BUT YOU'RE NOT--WHAT IT IS IS,
"OH, I'M GOING TO SPEND A MONTH

1586
01:10:57,967 --> 01:10:59,300
"NOT SMOKING IT.

1587
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:02,233
"I'M JUST GOING TO GET IT
FROM MY GLAND IN MY NECK

1588
01:11:02,267 --> 01:11:05,800
WHERE I KEEP EXTRA POT
IN CASE OF AN APOCALYPSE."

1589
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:07,767
HOW GREAT WOULD IT BE
IF THE LAST THING IN THE MOVIE

1590
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,633
IS THAT IT BURSTS
OUT OF MY HEAD?

1591
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:14,733
AND IT LOOKS LIKE TOMMY CHONG,

1592
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:17,333
A LITTLE--YOU GROW ANOTHER--

1593
01:11:17,367 --> 01:11:20,800
[Benson imitating Chong]
"I WAS IN YOUR HEAD, MAN.

1594
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:24,400
"WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?

1595
01:11:24,433 --> 01:11:27,367
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM
FOR A DUDE IN YOUR HEAD, MAN."

1596
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,100
[laughter]

1597
01:11:29,133 --> 01:11:32,000
"I WAS FUCKING CRAMPED, MAN.

1598
01:11:32,033 --> 01:11:33,867
YOU GOT ANY WEED?"

1599
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:34,933
DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS
TO MAKE THAT LEAP

1600
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:39,467
TO HAVING A DOCTOR
GIVE YOU THE THING

1601
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,800
SO YOU CAN JUST GO
IN DISPENSARIES AND...

1602
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:42,900
I DON'T KNOW.

1603
01:11:42,933 --> 01:11:44,767
BUY AMAZING WEED?

1604
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,767
THEN MY NAME'S
ON SOME LIST SOMEWHERE.

1605
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,867
THAT'S TRUE.

1606
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,500
RIGHT?

1607
01:11:50,533 --> 01:11:52,067
(man)
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

1608
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,900
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO REALLY TRACK DOWN--

1609
01:11:54,933 --> 01:11:56,900
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS
A LIST THAT EXISTS,

1610
01:11:56,933 --> 01:11:59,400
BUT UP HERE, IT SEEMS
LIKE THERE WOULD BE.

1611
01:11:59,433 --> 01:12:01,867
BUT, YOU KNOW,
COULDN'T THEY JUST--

1612
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,733
WOULDN'T THEY JUST
PENCIL YOUR NAME IN

1613
01:12:03,767 --> 01:12:05,633
IF THEY EVER SEE YOU ANYWHERE
DOING ANYTHING?

1614
01:12:05,667 --> 01:12:07,233
WELL, THAT'S TRUE, YEAH.

1615
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:08,100
[laughs]

1616
01:12:08,133 --> 01:12:10,467
YOU'RE PRETTY OPEN
ABOUT IT.

1617
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,433
BUT I DON'T HAVE A TON
OF MATERIAL ABOUT IT, BUT--

1618
01:12:12,467 --> 01:12:14,367
UH-UH.

1619
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,033
I DID TALK--I DID SAY
I SMOKED POT ON CONAN,

1620
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:19,733
SO THAT'S PROBABLY NOT
THE SMARTEST THING.

1621
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:22,067
[laughter]

1622
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,733
PEOPLE WATCH THAT,
RIGHT?

1623
01:12:23,767 --> 01:12:26,133
FEDS LOVE CONAN.

1624
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:39,500
BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS:

1625
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:43,567
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MARIJUANA
IN A PILL?

1626
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,533
SO WHAT'S THIS--

1627
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,000
LIKE, COCOA KRISPIES
THAT ARE FULL OF WEED?

1628
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,100
CUCUMBER, BOAT, WIRE.

1629
01:12:55,133 --> 01:12:57,133
I STILL GOT IT.

1630
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:58,600
WE'RE GOING TO DO
THAT MINI MENTAL STATUS THINGY,

1631
01:12:58,633 --> 01:13:00,633
BUT WHAT'S--

1632
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:01,633
YOU KNOW--

1633
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:03,367
CUCUMBER, BOAT, WIRE?

1634
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,433
OH, NO, THIS TIME,
IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

1635
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:06,367
OKAY, GOOD.

1636
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,167
SEE, I KNEW YOU'D REVIEW
THE TAPE,

1637
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,033
SO, BASICALLY, I CHANGED IT.

1638
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:10,433
I CHANGED IT ALL
COMPLETELY AROUND.

1639
01:13:10,467 --> 01:13:11,733
I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK
AT THE TAPE.

1640
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,567
I'VE BEEN OBSESSED
WITH CUCUMBER, BOAT, WIRE

1641
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,200
SINCE IT HAPPENED,

1642
01:13:14,233 --> 01:13:16,233
'CAUSE NOBODY REMEMBERS.

1643
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:18,100
BUT IF IT'S STILL THREE WORDS,
I'M GOING TO BE GOOD--

1644
01:13:18,133 --> 01:13:19,167
I'M GOING TO BE AWARE ENOUGH

1645
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,233
TO BE ABLE TO GET IT RIGHT,

1646
01:13:20,267 --> 01:13:21,667
EVEN THOUGH I'M...MEDICATED.

1647
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,500
YES, YOU ARE MEDICATED.

1648
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:25,733
[laughter]

1649
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:27,133
(cooing)
"YES, YOU ARE.

1650
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:29,033
LITTLE MEDICATED PATIENT."

1651
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:32,900
YOU SOUND MORE MEDICATED
THAN YOU DID LAST TIME.

1652
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:34,400
THIS IS A QUESTIONNAIRE
ABOUT POT

1653
01:13:34,433 --> 01:13:35,233
THAT I DEVISED
FOR THIS MOVIE

1654
01:13:35,267 --> 01:13:37,267
TO JUST ASK
RANDOM PEOPLE

1655
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,700
TO SEE HOW MUCH
THEY KNOW ABOUT POT

1656
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:40,800
AND THE SITUATION WITH POT
IN AMERICA TODAY.

1657
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,167
HERE WE GO.

1658
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,267
EAST BAY, FIRST QUESTION.

1659
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,700
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS
SMOKE POT?

1660
01:13:47,733 --> 01:13:49,067
80%.

1661
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,533
EXCELLENT GUESS;
IT'S 99%.

1662
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:55,867
[laughter]

1663
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,167
VERY CLOSE, THOUGH.

1664
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,500
DO YOU SMOKE POT?

1665
01:13:58,533 --> 01:13:59,567
NOT RECENTLY.

1666
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,300
YES.
NO.

1667
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:01,300
ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES
A YEAR.

1668
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,633
NO.
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON, LIKE--

1669
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:05,967
[laughter]

1670
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,200
WRITE THAT DOWN
AS A "YES."

1671
01:14:07,233 --> 01:14:07,967
NO.
OCCASIONALLY.

1672
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,567
OCCASIONALLY?
NO.

1673
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,533
YES, I DO.
DO YOU SMOKE POT?

1674
01:14:12,567 --> 01:14:14,133
YES.

1675
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:17,600
WELCOME TO THE MAJORITY.

1676
01:14:17,633 --> 01:14:19,600
OKAY, THREE WORDS.

1677
01:14:19,633 --> 01:14:23,133
CAB, AVOCADO, BRICK.

1678
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:25,900
CAB, AVOCADO, BRICK.

1679
01:14:25,933 --> 01:14:27,100
PERFECT.

1680
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:29,000
NOW, COUNT BACK FROM 100,
SUBTRACTING 7.

1681
01:14:29,033 --> 01:14:32,267
SO START WITH 100,
AND TELL ME WHAT'S--

1682
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,333
93.
UH-HUH.

1683
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:34,467
[laughs]
COME ON.

1684
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,467
93.

1685
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,600
82.

1686
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:40,633
OKAY.

1687
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:43,600
73.

1688
01:14:43,633 --> 01:14:44,633
MM-HMM.

1689
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:45,767
IS THAT RIGHT?

1690
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,800
KEEP GOING.

1691
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,467
JESUS.

1692
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,900
73, 64.

1693
01:14:51,933 --> 01:14:54,933
DO YOU THINK POT
IS ADDICTIVE?

1694
01:14:54,967 --> 01:14:56,400
YES.
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

1695
01:14:56,433 --> 01:14:58,567
I QUIT SMOKING POT
FOR 30 DAYS,

1696
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,700
AND NOW I'M SMOKING POT
AGAIN.

1697
01:15:01,733 --> 01:15:03,367
SO YOU'RE WRONG.

1698
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,833
DO I SEEM HIGH TO YOU
RIGHT NOW?

1699
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:07,033
MAYBE A LITTLE.

1700
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:08,533
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

1701
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:10,133
I'M TOTALLY HIGH
RIGHT NOW.

1702
01:15:10,167 --> 01:15:15,000
[laughter]

1703
01:15:15,033 --> 01:15:17,333
AT WHAT--THIS IS
AN IMPORTANT ONE

1704
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:18,700
AT THIS JUNCTURE.

1705
01:15:18,733 --> 01:15:19,767
AT WHAT AGE DO YOU THINK
IT'S OKAY FOR KIDS

1706
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,700
TO START GETTING HIGH?

1707
01:15:21,733 --> 01:15:23,733
UH, 18?

1708
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:25,667
MAYBE, LIKE, 16.

1709
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:26,933
7.
14.

1710
01:15:26,967 --> 01:15:28,167
18.
18.

1711
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:28,800
AS SOON AS YOU CAN USE
THE LIGHTER.

1712
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,967
18.
18?

1713
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,333
30.

1714
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:33,667
I THINK THEY NEED TO TALK
TO THEIR PARENTS FIRST.

1715
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,700
27, ACTUALLY.

1716
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:38,533
27.

1717
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:40,867
OKAY, WHAT ARE THOSE THREE WORDS
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE?

1718
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:44,133
CAB, AVOCADO, BRICK.

1719
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:45,267
YOU SCORED!

1720
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,833
EXCELLENT.
ALL RIGHT.

1721
01:15:46,867 --> 01:15:48,700
YOU GOT 24 THIS TIME.

1722
01:15:48,733 --> 01:15:51,667
AND LAST TIME...

1723
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,233
YOU GOT 27.

1724
01:15:53,267 --> 01:15:54,900
SO OVER 22 IS STILL NORMAL,

1725
01:15:54,933 --> 01:15:58,667
BUT YOU BARELY GOT IT.

1726
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:08,300
CAB, AVOCADO, BRICK--
YOU WERE JUST WAITING FOR THAT.

1727
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:10,600
YOUR--ACTUALLY,
IT'S INTERESTING.

1728
01:16:10,633 --> 01:16:14,500
YOUR MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS
COMPLETELY ARE GONE.

1729
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:17,800
I MEAN, YOU REALLY--
THE SERIALS SEVENS,

1730
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:20,600
YOU KIND OF COMPLETELY
GOT YOURSELF--

1731
01:16:20,633 --> 01:16:21,400
SERIAL SEVENS.

1732
01:16:21,433 --> 01:16:22,800
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I DID IS,

1733
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,200
I SWITCHED IT TO SERIAL NINES
PARTWAY FOR SOME REASON.

1734
01:16:25,233 --> 01:16:26,233
WHAT'S THE CHEMICAL NAME

1735
01:16:26,267 --> 01:16:28,267
FOR THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT
IN POT?

1736
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,933
TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL.

1737
01:16:29,967 --> 01:16:31,867
NO, IT'S AN APPLE.

1738
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,000
[laughter]

1739
01:16:35,033 --> 01:16:37,600
WHAT'S--OH, WAIT; THAT'S
THE ANSWER TO THE NEXT ONE.

1740
01:16:37,633 --> 01:16:38,700
[laughter]

1741
01:16:38,733 --> 01:16:41,567
WHAT'S THE BEST FRUIT
TO TURN INTO A PIPE?

1742
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:46,000
AN APPLE.
AN APPLE.

1743
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:47,633
APPLE, YES.

1744
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:50,067
[laughter]

1745
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:50,967
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE
FOR AN EIGHTH?

1746
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,300
THE GOOD STUFF
OR THE BAD STUFF?

1747
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:56,400
HA HA!
I GOT YOU!

1748
01:16:56,433 --> 01:16:59,800
SAY HELLO
TO OFFICER BENSON.

1749
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:00,800
[laughter]

1750
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:02,533
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN HIGH
AT WORK?

1751
01:17:02,567 --> 01:17:05,300
IF SO, WHAT DO YOU DO?
IF NOT, WHY NOT?

1752
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,100
UM...

1753
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:09,100
YOU CAN TAKE THE FIFTH.

1754
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:10,200
HOW MANY--
OR TAKE AN EIGHTH.

1755
01:17:10,233 --> 01:17:14,500
HOW MANY PRESIDENTS--
BOOM.

1756
01:17:14,533 --> 01:17:17,367
YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF
PHYSICAL HARM,

1757
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,467
AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME,
ZIPPO.

1758
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:38,633
DO YOU FEEL, THOUGH,

1759
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:40,300
LIVING LIKE THIS
IS SUSTAINABLE?

1760
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,500
IN OTHER WORDS,
FOR YOUR CAREER,

1761
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:43,533
YOU KNOW, SMOKING--

1762
01:17:43,567 --> 01:17:44,433
I THINK I COULD GET AWAY WITH IT

1763
01:17:44,467 --> 01:17:46,833
BUT THAT I DON'T INTEND TO.

1764
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:47,900
WHY?

1765
01:17:47,933 --> 01:17:48,867
BECAUSE--

1766
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,433
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT

1767
01:17:50,467 --> 01:17:51,833
I'D BE SICK
OF SMOKING POT

1768
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:52,967
AT THE END OF THE 30 DAYS,
AND IT TURNS OUT I'M NOT.

1769
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,267
IT'S BEEN GREAT.

1770
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,500
BUT I'VE BEEN HAVING PEOPLE
DRIVE ME AROUND EVERYWHERE.

1771
01:17:57,533 --> 01:17:59,900
[woman over speaker]
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

1772
01:17:59,933 --> 01:18:01,067
HOWEVER, REMEMBER, IF YOU LEFT
A GREEN-TAG ITEM

1773
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,067
AT THE BAGGAGE STAND,

1774
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,633
PLEASE WAIT FOR IT HERE
AT THE JET BRIDGE

1775
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:06,000
OFF THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE
WITHOUT CAUSING A TRAFFIC JAM.

1776
01:18:06,033 --> 01:18:08,667
HAVE A GREAT AFTERNOON.

1777
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,500
OW!

1778
01:18:11,533 --> 01:18:14,933
MY NAME IS DOUG BENSON,
AND I AM SUPER HIGH.

1779
01:18:14,967 --> 01:18:18,667
[low note]

1780
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,633
[laughs]

1781
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:25,400
CALIFORNIA'S
A MEDICAL MARIJUANA STATE.

1782
01:18:25,433 --> 01:18:26,467
[scattered cheers]

1783
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,367
SO I GOT MY LICENSE.

1784
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,700
I GOT A FUCKING LICENSE
TO SMOKE POT.

1785
01:18:32,733 --> 01:18:35,767
I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO A TEST
OR ANYTHING.

1786
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,467
I JUST HAD TO GO,
"IT HURTS ME IN MY BACK."

1787
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,400
"HERE YOU GO.

1788
01:18:40,433 --> 01:18:43,200
I'M A DOCTOR;
HERE YOU GO."

1789
01:18:43,233 --> 01:18:45,967
AND I'M LIKE, "$200."

1790
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,900
AND NOW I HAVE A LICENSE
THAT SAYS I CAN SMOKE POT.

1791
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:54,900
NO ONE HERE HAS THAT,
NOT IN IDAHO.

1792
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:58,500
BUT YOU SHOULD,

1793
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:00,267
'CAUSE THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.

1794
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,833
[man sneezes]

1795
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:05,333
MOST--BLESS YOU.

1796
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,500
YOU GUYS ARE ALLERGIC
TO THE TRUTH.

1797
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:10,200
[laughter]

1798
01:19:10,233 --> 01:19:14,900
AND I'M STANDING
ON MY OWN JACKET.

1799
01:19:14,933 --> 01:19:16,100
I'M SCARED.

1800
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:18,500
IT'S SCARY TO BE IN A STATE
THAT DOESN'T--

1801
01:19:18,533 --> 01:19:20,333
THAT IT'S, YOU KNOW,
COOL WITH IT.

1802
01:19:20,367 --> 01:19:23,200
I MEAN, NOT THAT--
YOU KNOW, CALIFORNIA,

1803
01:19:23,233 --> 01:19:26,800
IT'S LEGAL ON A STATE LEVEL.

1804
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:29,133
BUT ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL,
IT'S STILL ILLEGAL,

1805
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:33,867
SO A FED COULD SWEEP IN
AND FUCKING BE LIKE, "NUH-UH."

1806
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,233
beep!

1807
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:36,633
[man on answering machine]
THE PHARMACY IS BEING RAIDED

1808
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:40,033
RIGHT NOW,
AS OF ABOUT THREE MINUTES AGO.

1809
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:42,033
CALL ME BACK.

1810
01:19:42,067 --> 01:19:43,467
ULTIMATELY, IT COMES DOWN
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

1811
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:47,667
TO DECIDE WHAT IS
AND IS NOT LEGAL.

1812
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,200
MARIJUANA IS ILLEGAL
IN ANY FORM UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

1813
01:19:49,233 --> 01:19:51,300
FEDERAL DRUG AGENTS RAIDED

1814
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:54,367
11 MEDICAL MARIJUANA OUTLETS
TODAY IN L.A. COUNTY.

1815
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,533
THE D.E.A. AGENTS

1816
01:19:55,567 --> 01:19:57,133
SWOOPED DOWN ON L.A. CLINICS

1817
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:59,767
BECAUSE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES
DON'T RECOGNIZE CALIFORNIA'S LAW

1818
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,933
THAT ALLOWS MEDICAL USE
OF MARIJUANA.

1819
01:20:01,967 --> 01:20:05,967
YESTERDAY, D.E.A. AGENTS
APPLIED SEARCH WARRANTS

1820
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,767
AND WENT INTO 11 FACILITIES
HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

1821
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,533
(man)
YEAH, THEY'VE BLOCKED OFF
THE ROAD,

1822
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:11,700
AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING OFF.

1823
01:20:11,733 --> 01:20:13,200
I'M GOING TO GET OUT.

1824
01:20:13,233 --> 01:20:17,300
(Benson)
LET'S GO.

1825
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:20,200
(woman)
THEY TOOK ALL OF THE MEDICATION
AND PATIENT RECORDS

1826
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:22,033
IN ALL OF THESE FACILITIES.

1827
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:24,167
THE CLIMATE OF FEAR
IS VERY REAL.

1828
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,367
(Walker Young)
* OH, I SAID
PLEASE DON'T TEAR ME DOWN. *

1829
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,467
* I'M JUST NOW STANDING UP.

1830

SOME BIG MISTAKES. *

1831
01:20:31,133 --> 01:20:34,633
* I WANNA GET FUCKED UP
JUST LIKE I USED TO DO *

1832
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:36,333
* WITH MY DADDY PRESIDENT.

1833
01:20:36,367 --> 01:20:37,800
* I WILL BREAK ALL THE RULES.

01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,767
* OH, I WILL HAVE
NO REGRETS, *

1835
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,867
* 'CAUSE I AM PRESIDENT NOW.

1836
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,200
* YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT,

1837
01:20:43,233 --> 01:20:46,767
* A DUMB GOOD OL' BOY
COULD EVER ACHIEVE IT, *

1838
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,100
* POLITICS AND FAME,
FAME AND DISASTER. *

1839
01:20:51,133 --> 01:20:54,067
* LET'S GO TO WAR.
I'LL SHOW YOU THE MASTER. *

1840
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,900
* YOU KNOW, THESE PUPPET STRINGS
ARE HARD TO BREAK. *

01:20:57,933 --> 01:21:02,100

(man)
I'M WAITING FOR A SHERIFF

1843
01:21:03,433 --> 01:21:05,733
WHO NEEDS
MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

1844
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:06,867
I'M NOT GONNA SAY
IT WON'T HAPPEN,

1845
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:11,067
BECAUSE IF IT'S NEEDED,
IT'S NEEDED.

1846
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,000
YEAH, IF IT'S NEEDED,
IT'S NEEDED.

1847
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:15,000
THAT'S WHY
I KEEP FIGHTING.

1848
01:21:15,033 --> 01:21:15,967
ALL RIGHT.

1849
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,133
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

1850
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:20,800
[people talking]

1851
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:23,733
[people chanting]
SAFE ACCESS NOW.
SAFE ACCESS NOW.

1852
01:21:23,767 --> 01:21:26,700
SO WE ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE
OF THIS ACTION TODAY.

1853
01:21:26,733 --> 01:21:28,133
THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD
BELIEVES

1854
01:21:28,167 --> 01:21:30,267
THAT WE HAVE A HANDLE
ON THESE FACILITIES.

1855
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,767
WE HAVE REGULATIONS IN PLACE.

1856
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,100
WE WORK CLOSELY
WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

1857
01:21:33,133 --> 01:21:36,233
TO ENSURE THAT THEY OPERATE
WITH THE INTENT AND SPIRIT

1858
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:37,767
OF PROPOSITION 215.

1859
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,400
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
HAS THE RIGHT.

1860
01:21:39,433 --> 01:21:40,500
WE CAN'T STOP THEM.

1861
01:21:40,533 --> 01:21:43,200

BY THE FEDERAL AGENTS
RIGHT NOW.

1877

THESE GUYS SHOULD BE ENFORCING
CALIFORNIA STATE LAW, PERIOD.

1878
01:23:30,867 --> 01:23:32,833

THEY'RE NOT
SHUTTING US ALL DOWN,

1879
01:23:32,867 --> 01:23:35,000
AND WE WILL REOPEN,
BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA,

01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:38,767
THE BIGGEST TREES IN THE WORLD
GROW FROM LITTLE SEEDS.

IT'S JUST A LITTLE SEED.

1882
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,200
ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE
BEHIND US EARLIER

1883
01:23:42,233 --> 01:23:43,100
ARE LITTLE SEEDS.

1884
01:23:43,133 --> 01:23:45,533
THIS MOVEMENT
WILL NOT BE SHOT DOWN.

1885
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:47,333

I'VE BEEN A PATIENT

1886
01:23:47,367 --> 01:23:48,867
FOR ALMOST 11 OR 12 YEARS.

1887
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,067
WHEN I CLIMBED UP THOSE STAIRS
IN SAN FRANCISCO

1888
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,033
AND RAN INTO DENNIS PERON
WALKING DOWN THE FIRST BLOCK

1889
01:23:54,067 --> 01:23:55,900

"RICHARD, I'M SENDING A GUY

01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:59,967
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
GETTING MYSELF INTO.

1892
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,900
BUT I'M A PROUD
AMERICAN PATRIOT,

1893
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:06,067
AND I WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING
FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

1894
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:20,267
SO IT'S 4:20 ON DAY 30 ON--

01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,500
[Campbell over speakerphone]
DOUG BENSON, IT'S OVER.

1896
01:24:22,533 --> 01:24:25,300
OH, IT'S JUST STARTING.

1897
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:26,367
[laughs]

1898
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,800
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW,
GOING INTO THIS THING,

1899
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:31,933
I THOUGHT THAT BY DAY 30,

1900
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:34,067
I WOULD BE SO SICK OF POT
AND BEING HIGH

1901
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:36,133
AND JUST BE DYING
TO BE DONE WITH IT

1902
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:37,633
FOR AT LEAST--
AT LEAST TAKE A BREAK

1903
01:24:37,667 --> 01:24:39,667
FOR A LITTLE WHILE, YOU KNOW?

1904
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,567
BUT I'M SITTING HERE.

1905
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,300
IT'S 4:20, AND I'M ABOUT
TO LIGHT JOINT NUMBER TWO.

1906
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:47,800
OKAY.

1907
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,033
'CAUSE, YEAH,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO NOW.

1908

YOU'RE OFF THE CLOCK, SO--

1909
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:53,067
I TOTALLY DON'T HAVE TO.

1910
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,133
IT'S PERSONAL CHOICE NOW.

1911
01:24:54,167 --> 01:25:00,567
UM...

1912
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,967
ROLL SOME MORE JOINTS.

1913
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,200
YOU GUYS ARE HERE ON DAY 30.

1914
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,900
THIS IS DAY 30 OF GETTING HIGH
ALL DAY EVERY DAY

1915
01:25:08,933 --> 01:25:11,867
FROM THE SECOND I WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING

1916
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,967
UNTIL I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.

1917
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,633
AND I GET TO WAKE-AND-BAKE.

1918
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:17,233
THAT'S HOW I START.

1919
01:25:17,267 --> 01:25:21,000
AND THEN I DON'T HAVE A RHYME
FOR THE END OF THE DAY, BUT...

1920
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,900
(woman)
IS THE PROGRAM INTERVENTION?

1921
01:25:22,933 --> 01:25:23,967

JEOPARDY OR SOMETHING,

1926
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:37,767
WHERE THE QUESTION
IS THE ANSWER?

1927
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,133
[laughter]

1928
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:42,400
'CAUSE THAT WAS WORDED
REALLY STRANGELY.

1930

IF I HAD
AN INTERVENTION, MAN.

1931
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:52,200
I GUESS YOU COULD TRY
TO DO ONE NOW,

1932
01:25:52,233 --> 01:25:54,233
BUT THIS IS THE LAST DAY.

1933

[laughter]

1934
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,967

"STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING."

1936
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
THAT'S LIKE IF THE GUY
IN SUPER SIZE ME

1937
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:05,900
WAS LIKE, ON DAY 30,
"I CAN'T DO IT."

WELL, YOU ALREADY DID
A LOT OF DAMAGE.

1939
01:26:10,067 --> 01:26:13,867
SO THIS IS DAY 30,
AND I GOT TO SAY, HONESTLY,

1940
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:18,533
IT'S A FANTASTIC WAY TO LIVE.

1941
01:26:18,567 --> 01:26:21,233
I RECOMMEND YOU ALL BECOME
STAND-UP COMICS

WHO DON'T HAVE ANYTHING, REALLY,
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO

1943
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,300
DURING THE DAY.

1944
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:29,000
AND AT NIGHT, YOU CAN GET AWAY
WITH ACTING LIKE A BUFFOON

1945
01:26:29,033 --> 01:26:30,433
IN FRONT OF NICE PEOPLE

1946
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:33,433
WHO JUST WANT
AN OLD-FASHIONED INTERVENTION.

[laughter]

1948

AND, FINALLY,
DO YOU THINK SICK PEOPLE

1949
01:26:39,267 --> 01:26:40,667
WHO FEEL BETTER
WHEN THEY SMOKE POT

1950
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:41,700
SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO

1951
01:26:41,733 --> 01:26:42,967
IN THE PRIVACY
OF THEIR OWN HOMES

1952
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,633
WHILE NOT OPERATING
HEAVY MACHINERY

1953
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:45,833
AND POSSIBLY WATCHING

01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:49,500
YES.

1956
01:26:49,533 --> 01:26:50,467
YES.

THANK YOU, JOE.

1958

YOU WERE AWESOME, MAN.

1959

FOR COMING OUT.

1961

I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

1962
01:26:58,633 --> 01:27:00,600
BYE-BYE.
