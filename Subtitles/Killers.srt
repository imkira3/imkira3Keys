00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:14,269
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

3
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:17,724
<i>Flight time to Nice will be
seven hours thirty minutes.</i>

4
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:19,554
<i>Our flight attendants
will be coming by</i>

5
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:21,895
<i>to provide you with
complimentary beverages.</i>

6
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:22,637
Excuse me...

7
00:00:22,737 --> 00:00:24,960
<i>We will be flying at
an altitude of 31,000 feet.</i>

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,979
Hello?

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,800
<i>Relax and enjoy your flight.</i>

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,801
Excuse me!

11
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:29,988
Hey there!

12
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:31,840
Mom!

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,982
Do you mind?

14
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:34,825
Emergency exit's 13D sweetie.

15
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,602
Great, got it, thanks Dad.

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,482
<i>Excuse me. Bonjour</i>

17
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,114
- Three Chardonnay's please.
- No, nothing for me.

18
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:45,970
- I always remain alert in flight.
- Me neither, thank you.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,964
Just the three then.

20
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:52,297
I am so proud of you sweetie.
A lot of women who just got dumped

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,955
would have backed out of this
vacation but not you.

22
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:56,629
Thanks dad, but I didn't get dumped.

23
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,431
- It wasn't quite like that it...
- It was mutual.

24
00:00:58,473 --> 00:01:00,037
Yes, they agreed to part ways

25
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:00,913
when he dumped her.

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,245
I thought it was because
he needed space?

27
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,260
No, he just didn't find
her spontaneous enough.

28
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,150
Too safe?

29
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:07,741
Predictable.

30
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,846
I am sitting right here.
I can hear you.

31
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,902
He tried to get you to go

32
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:12,387
<i>Bungie jump but you wouldn't do it.</i>

33
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:15,135
I have a thing about
heights and a rule about

34
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:17,120
vomiting in public.
I think that's perfectly reasonable.

35
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,557
Too many rules, dear.

36
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:20,581
There's nothing wrong with
being cautious sweetie,

37
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:22,393
safety is sexy.

38
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:25,047
The first time your mother and
I made love we managed to keep our

39
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:27,640
seatbelts on the entire time.
It wasn't easy.

40
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,407
Ok dad!

41
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,951
What did I just say
about vomiting in public?

42
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:33,833
Change seats.

43
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:38,780
- And the emergency exit is?
- 13D trust me, I know where it is.

44
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,296
About to throw myself out of it.

45
00:02:55,672 --> 00:02:57,109
I've got a visual on him now.

46
00:02:58,093 --> 00:02:59,562
Target confirmed.

47
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:01,032
I know the drill.

48
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:12,087
<i>You have until five pm to
deliver the package.</i>

49
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:14,503
<i>Then the boss wants you
to close the account.</i>

50
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:17,297
Yeah, yeah, I will have his final bill
ready to go.

51
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,909
You have my wife and
I on the second floor,

52
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,364
and my daughter on the third,

53
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:24,045
when I specifically booked
adjacent rooms.

54
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,592
I assure you, your room
is lovely Mr...

55
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:27,919
Lovely and adjacent are not
the same thing.

56
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,605
- She's a single woman, all alone.
- Ohh!

57
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:34,618
Recently single. I'm not always alone.

58
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:36,377
Dad, the room is fine, can you just...

59
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:38,859
Do you know how many push in robberies
happen in hotels sweetie?

60
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:43,073
Third floor. We'd like an ocean view.

61
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:45,031
Always the same things with the rooms.

62
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,251
Let daddy do his thing.

63
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,141
The little Frenchman will cave.

64
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:49,995
He's a weasel face like "you know who"

65
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:52,732
Richard, I'm talking about Richard.

66
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,084
I know, mother.

67
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,960
We're not discussing him anymore,
remember?

68
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,253
Right... right.

69
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,813
- He's dead to us.
- Yes!

70
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:01,877
So it never bothered you that he
had kind of a womanly butt?

71
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:03,115
What?

72
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:05,369
No, he did not!

73
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,571
Forget I said anything.

74
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:09,590
I do not speak French.

75
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,800
Excuse me, we've resolved the problem.

76
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,031
I'm gonna go check on my room.

77
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,277
You and daddy figure this out.

78
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:15,632
You want a Maalox for the road?

79
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,779
Wouldn't it be easier just
to humour me?

80
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,126
<i>- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.</i>

81
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:03,004
I don't speak French.

82
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:06,842
Yeah, no. I got it the first time.

83
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:08,827
Why were you pretending back there?

84
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,263
I don't know? Why did you follow me?

85
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:14,124
I was already going to the beach,
remember?

86
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:17,143
Yeah, well I could be going
swimming too.

87
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:18,311
Are you?

88
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:19,730
No.

89
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:24,310
I'm just going to go marinate
in shame.

90
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm Spencer, by the way.

91
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,320
It's nice to meet you, Spencer.

92
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,405
Do you have a name?

93
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,507
Jen, Jennifer, sometimes Jenny,
no its...

94
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:36,079
Jen. It's just Jen.

95
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:39,457
I'm gonna go uh... swimming,
before it gets dark.

96
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,209
Yes, of course.

97
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:42,881
Muscles like that take some upkeep.

98
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:55,299
Do you wanna get a drink
with me tonight?

99
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:58,935
Yeah, yeah sure. I don't have anything
better to do. So why not?

100
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:00,556
Great.

101
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:03,732
<i>I'll see you at "Stella Maurice"
at sunset.</i>

102
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:06,472
Unless you have something
better to do.

103
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,701
Oh no... no cute dress?

104
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:28,318
I didn't pack a single cute dress?

105
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:29,687
Oh God!

106
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,136
I don't think I have all my socks.
Gotta find a dress.

107
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,109
Thank you!

108
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,887
<i>Merci Madame!</i>

109
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,748
We knocked on your door several times.
I can't believe you're missing this.

110
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:05,042
I know dad, I'm sorry. It's just...

111
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:07,796
You know, my stomach.
It's going crazy.

112
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:14,813
We'll come back right away
with saltines and ginger ale.

113
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:16,505
No! Stay put. I'm fine.

114
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,409
Don't be a hero sweetie.

115
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:20,892
Dad trust me,
you don't want to be a part of this.

116
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:21,988
Uh... wait.

117
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,133
Darling?

118
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:24,870
At least you'll look thin
on the beach.

119
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:30,454
Are you sure you're going
to be all right?

120
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,259
Yes! You and mom go.

121
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,364
Have fun without me.

122
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:34,875
Hey!

123
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,507
You're going to find the perfect guy.

124
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:41,136
Someone who's good and decent
and kind,

125
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,522
who doesn't have a dishonest bone
in his body.

126
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,369
Oh God!

127
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,128
You picked a perfect table.

128
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,836
- I had to atone for being late.
- Ooh. Too bad I hate champagne.

129
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:14,102
- Really? I'm sorry, please no...
- I was joking...

130
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:17,234
<i>It was a joke. That was a joke.</i>

131
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:22,050
<i>I am a dating robot,
sent here to observe your ways.</i>

132
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,414
You just pulled a robot voice.

133
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:35,051
All right, don't worry. There's
a certain segment of the population

134
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,671
that goes over big for that
sort of thing.

135
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:37,872
Yeah... nerds!

136
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,033
They're my bread and butter.

137
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:41,033
Yeah? How's that working out for you?

138
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:44,985
Oh God! Oh shit!

139
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,050
Hmm... this is adorable.
How about you?

140
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:52,278
I don't know.

141
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:54,215
What are we... are you all right?

142
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:02,016
Hi!

143
00:11:03,877 --> 00:11:04,963
Are you on the lamb?

144
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:11,080
You see that guy over by the menus?
Freakishly tall, excellent mustache.

145
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:19,516
- Ok!
- No, I do need to sit down somewhere.

146
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:24,182
That is a gorgeous mustache.

147
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:28,931
Well, he umm...
he's a Russian diplomat.

148
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,744
Also kind of a pervert.

149
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,140
Sat next to him on the plane...
got a little grabby.

150
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:38,521
Really? Wait, wait, wait...
Women don't like grabby?

151
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:40,792
I'm gonna have to change my whole M.O.

152
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:45,683
I also heard him in the hotel
trying to get the

153
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:47,747
room next to mine.
It was just kind of weird.

154
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,124
I hope you switched rooms.

155
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,252
Oh no, no. I like to live on the edge.

156
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:56,965
Dangerous weirdoes, spicy food...
Bungie jumping.

157
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,667
I can see dangerous weirdoes
and spicy foods but...

158
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:05,297
Bungie jumping? I'm mean it's almost
never sexy to puke in public.

159
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:07,256
That's what I said.

160
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:08,393
Really?

161
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:09,686
Yeah.

162
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,022
I mean it's really nice down here
and all but...

163
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,788
My bet is that they're gone so...

164
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:16,986
Shall we?

165
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:19,459
Sure. Ok!

166
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,397
So...

167
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:26,743
Should we order?

168
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,117
You know what? Let's get out of here.

169
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:38,351
The service is awful and...
I need to show you Nice.

170
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:46,929
You realize I'm gonna make you tell me
your whole life story.

171
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,186
Trust me. It's boring.

172
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:05,566
Do you want some of mine?

173
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,662
Oh no! Actually I really don't drink
that much... I should just...

174
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:10,247
Slow down.

175
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:13,747
What do you do?

176
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:14,985
Me?

177
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,488
Consulting... I'm a consultant...
for a company.

178
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,065
Company consulting.

179
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:26,603
Lately we've been doing a lot of
downsizing. I travel a lot so...

180
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,327
Downsizing... people!

181
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:30,618
Oh.

182
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:32,727
Well if you could do anything...
you know...

183
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:34,238
anything in the world,
what would you do?

184
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:37,772
I just think it would be nice
to put down some roots, you know.

185
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:42,546
I've actually always wanted to know my
neighbors. I've never had that before.

186
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,035
That's actually pretty beautiful.

187
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,655
You're pretty beautiful.

188
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:50,908
It's the dress, I...

189
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:52,736
It's not the dress.

190
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,711
You'd be beautiful without the dress.

191
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,287
Not that I'm visualizing you naked.
Although...

192
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,389
I'm sure you would look beautiful...
I'm saying that...

193
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,259
you would be... beautiful... clothed...

194
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,926
...differently as well.

195
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,114
Yeah, thank you. I do need another.

196
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,620
- Why don't I get you another?
- Okay

197
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:13,598
Don't leave.

198
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,318
I won't.

199
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:26,261
Stay put! Hmmph.

200
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:33,019
Okay, fine. I will dance with you.

201
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,319
I'm sorry. What?

202
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:37,946
You almost ripped out of your dress
to try to seduce me.

203
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:38,715
It worked!

204
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:39,905
- No, I was...
- Let's dance.

205
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:41,145
Okay, maybe just for a minute.

206
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:47,225
Wow! You are...
a very enthusiastic dancer.

207
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,060
Oh, oh this... oh God! Ahh...

208
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,646
This is very nice
but I should really get back

209
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:58,651
to my date.

210
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:01,077
Now, I blow your mind. Don't move.

211
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:03,822
Oh, now you're gonna blow my mind.
Okay, oh God...

212
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,491
Excuse me, I'm going to cut in here.

213
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:07,977
Back off, Yankee...

214
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,809
Go find your own prostitute.

215
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,574
Oh no. No, you're misunderstanding.

216
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:14,324
I'm sorry, I am not a prostitute...

217
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:17,627
- Does this dress say prostitute?
- No.

218
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,899
It's not really,
it's just its, its maybe...

219
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,787
Wait... just Jen.

220
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,605
Yes?

221
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,069
- Just Jen!
- Yes?

222
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:32,311
There's something that I've been
wanting to do.

223
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:40,759
Your tag was still on.

224
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,144
- Oh no!
- Sorry.

225
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:43,800
- No, no no no.
- It's okay

226
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,158
It's okay.

227
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:48,287
No. It's... I can't afford this dress.

228
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,312
I left the tag on because
I can't afford it.

229
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,182
Not unless my father buys it
for me which

230
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:56,405
he wouldn't because... he's not here.

231
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:58,123
It's okay.

232
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,916
It's fine. Are you okay?

233
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,564
No, I can't believe this. So tight!

234
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:04,533
Oh God! I knew it.

235
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,109
I'm sorry, I can't keep this up.
I am not this girl.

236
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,217
I am not spontaneous.

237
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,219
I never drink this much.

238
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:16,975
And I don't live on the edge.
I live a very quiet, normal life.

239
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,943
I would like a normal life,
I'd kill for a normal life.

240
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,413
Well, just it... it gets,
it gets worse.

241
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,623
Just, you know that guy...

242
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,901
At the restaurant with the mustache?

243
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,399
The restaurant pervert?

244
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,077
That's my dad.

245
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,543
- Wow.
- Yeah.

246
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,146
Sounds like
a really bad home situation.

247
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:35,720
No, no! Oh God! No.

248
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,237
He's not Russian or a pervert.

249
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,368
He's a pilot.

250
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:43,212
You know, he flies planes. I...
I came on vacation with my parents.

251
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:45,669
That's... how lame I am.

252
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:47,985
I was supposed to come here
with my geek boyfriend

253
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:50,008
but he dumped me for
this girl and then...

254
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,515
Sorry. Go ahead.

255
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:07,567
I can't breathe.

256
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,321
This dress is really, really tight.

257
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,165
I need to get out of it, seriously.

258
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:14,230
I've been sucking it in all night.

259
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:16,384
Can you just... you gotta get it off.
Just take it off.

260
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:17,990
- Really?
- Yeah, take it off.

261
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,121
- Okay, all right.
- Yeah, lets do this.

262
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:25,110
The zipper's stuck.

263
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:27,329
Just break it, its fine.
My father will pay for it.

264
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,506
- Break it?
- Yeah, break it.

265
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,466
Here just... turn around.

266
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:35,383
- Stay still... don't... hold still.
- Oh, my God!

267
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,775
I... uh...

268
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:52,055
Thanks!

269
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,323
I'll be... I'm gonna be over here.

270
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,762
Doing this... in this manner.

271
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:04,011
Thank you for...

272
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,095
being so honest.

273
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:09,869
I actually feel like I should share
something with you.

274
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:13,765
It's gonna be really hard to say

275
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:14,422
but...

276
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,551
I feel like... you're real. So...

277
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:21,244
I want to be real with you.

278
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,656
Haven't really told anyone this
before but...

279
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:31,074
I kill people.

280
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,113
Wow. You're taking this a lot better
than I expected.

281
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:46,461
Awesome.

282
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:51,338
I mean usually it's bad people.

283
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,628
It's not like I'm out killing
good guys.

284
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:55,670
I'm not a murderer.
I'm a professional.

285
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:57,174
Like I professionally...

286
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:58,839
...kill people.

287
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:01,086
You're a great listener.

288
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:03,978
Excellent listener.

289
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:09,325
I don't like what I do,
I'm not a fan of it.

290
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:11,633
But I like you.

291
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:22,505
Tomorrow, I'm going to show you Nice.

292
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:27,393
And hopefully...
that's just the beginning.

293
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:31,342
Cause I like you.

294
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,454
You should take a bite.

295
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,750
Go ahead and try it,
I'm not going to eat it all.

296
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,406
Good lord! French food...

297
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,939
I'm going to uh...
just going to go to the restroom.

298
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,496
It's a crush, Spence. It happens.

299
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:39,339
Go shoot some guns
and screw some models.

300
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,570
You'll be good as new.

301
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,968
Then what? Kill some more people...

302
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,758
They're enemies of the state.
Not people.

303
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:46,726
Are you sure about that?

304
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:49,088
Cause five years ago
Levedeaux worked for us.

305
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,647
And then the NSA and God knows who
else. But this week he's the enemy.

306
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,104
What the hell's wrong with you?

307
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,147
You go and screw Polly Anna for a week

308
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,149
and suddenly your life's work's
out the window?

309
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,317
She's normal.

310
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,112
And I feel normal when I'm with her.
And maybe I...

311
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:05,748
Wake up! Her world only exists
because of people like us.

312
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,993
And I'm sorry if people change sides.

313
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,913
Sometimes a friend becomes an enemy
and you have to take them out.

314
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:15,085
She trusts me.

315
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,669
And I'm not
willing to compromise that.

316
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,339
These jobs are not optional, Spencer.

317
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,758
You don't get to just walk away.

318
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,926
Watch me.

319
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,098
You are who you are, Spencer!
You can't change that.

320
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:46,718
I think the best part
is you're finally with someone

321
00:22:46,728 --> 00:22:48,700
who's genuinely attractive.

322
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,701
I know.

323
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,702
I know.

324
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,788
I keep thinking I'm going to build up
some kind of tolerance to his...

325
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:56,583
physical, God-like perfection,

326
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,407
which just hasn’t happened yet.

327
00:23:04,914 --> 00:23:05,992
I'm okay.

328
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,576
It's a little early, mom.

329
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,340
Ha ha! Early...

330
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,673
Do you think they're all right
up there?

331
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,089
Oh, as long as daddy doesn't shoot
him, we're good.

332
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,806
So, I hear you're jobless.

333
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,609
Corporate consulting’s a tough
business, sir.

334
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:36,042
Jen and I were talking about putting
some roots down.

335
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:37,522
I might open up my own firm here.

336
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:38,569
Look at my shoes.

337
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,732
They’re Edward Greene.
I picked them up 20 years ago

338
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:44,558
when I was still flying
the London route.

339
00:23:44,593 --> 00:23:47,384
If you have something of great quality

340
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:50,136
and you take good care of it,
you'll have it forever.

341
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:57,692
I know you're worried about Jen.

342
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,229
Why would I worry?

343
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,315
I am confident

344
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:06,475
that you'll never hurt her.

345
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,696
That's a nice shot.

346
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,411
Thank you. I was an Eagle Scout.

347
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:14,735
They really let you shoot stuff
in the Boy Scouts?

348
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,084
So do the Marines.

349
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:18,670
<i>Semper Fi!</i>

350
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,437
That was yours.

351
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,223
- I'm sorry. I...
- Be prepared Spencer.

352
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:23,698
You would have learned
that in the Boy Scouts.

353
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:30,265
I was in 4H.

354
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,640
You know,
Jen's not some fragile China doll.

355
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,379
She's funny, and she's sweet.
And she's smart.

356
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,487
But in this kind of an off kilter
kind of way where one minute she

357
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:46,365
could be talking about the
strategic value of Nice in WWII,

358
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,663
and the next she's telling me that
Carey Grant dropped acid.

359
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,915
Which I... my point is...

360
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:56,619
It doesn't matter what she says,

361
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,747
I can trust her.

362
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,249
I depend on her.

363
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,132
Sir, it's not the other way around.

364
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,534
So...

365
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:08,279
with your blessing

366
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:11,635
I'm going to marry her.

367
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:20,921
Welcome to the family, Spencer.

368
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,593
- Thank you Mr. Cornfield.
- Please... call me sir.

369
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:31,815
How big is it?

370
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,437
Oh, it's big. It's probably the
biggest on the block.

371
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,808
Well, have I ever seen anything
like it before?

372
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,723
Uhh... maybe in a magazine
or in your dreams.

373
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,631
Will I know what to do with it?

374
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,553
I'll help you navigate the
tricky parts.

375
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,955
Creedy, creedy.

376
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:50,236
It's this blindfold that's making me...

377
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:52,048
- Owww! Honey.
- Sorry, sorry. I didn't...

378
00:25:57,941 --> 00:25:58,741
Prepare...

379
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:00,970
to be...

380
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,273
...thrilled.

381
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:08,733
Oh my God!

382
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,193
Spence.

383
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,279
You remodeled my office.

384
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,614
It's so organized.

385
00:26:15,318 --> 00:26:17,524
Okay, you can kiss me now.

386
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:23,780
How did I get so lucky?

387
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,037
How did I get a guy like you?

388
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:26,810
It was easy.

389
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,263
It was your charm

390
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,229
and your wit.

391
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:36,240
You really should not be
spoiling me especially since...

392
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:39,524
it's your birthday weekend.

393
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:40,715
No, we talked about this, right.

394
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:42,153
We're not going to make a big
deal out of it this year.

395
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,394
No presents, no parties.

396
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,834
It's just dinner tomorrow night
with my parents, I promise

397
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:49,232
but I never agreed to no presents.

398
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,569
Come on! I have been keeping this
secret for a week.

399
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,606
I'm at my limit.

400
00:26:55,693 --> 00:26:56,684
You kill me.

401
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:01,208
Open it. It's tickets to Nice.

402
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,533
I thought we could go back to
where it began you know,

403
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:06,290
and the best part is we
can go anytime.

404
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,628
But because I rule, I got two weeks
off at the end of the month.

405
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:13,854
What?

406
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:16,559
Do you not want to go to Nice?

407
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:17,390
Of course I do.

408
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,595
I... it's...

409
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:24,852
Things are hectic at work right now
and... we have a lot going on here.

410
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,999
Plus the Peach parade
is at the end of the month and

411
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,385
you were going to make
your cobbler.

412
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:32,025
My cobbler sucks.

413
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:35,320
You know what made Nice great?

414
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,898
You!

415
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:45,247
I have everything that I need.
Right here!

416
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:09,137
Hey batter batter batter batter.
Hey batter batter batter.

417
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,987
Let's go! Pick up the pace.

418
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,781
Spencer!

419
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,657
Hi!

420
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,741
Lily and Mac.

421
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,622
Hey! I'm glad we caught you.

422
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,949
- Block Party.
- All right.

423
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:28,449
Yeah, and you guys can dress up.

424
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,636
- Perfect!
- Okay.

425
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,944
You know what? Here's another one.

426
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,632
Yeah. We're going to have
those wings.

427
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:34,168
Great.

428
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:35,464
That's got a little bit of
my spit on it.

429
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,965
Don't clone me.

430
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,552
Okay, we're going to go make love.
You have fun.

431
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:41,910
- Okay.
- Take care.

432
00:28:41,948 --> 00:28:42,498
Have a good one.

433
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,348
Block party, Block party!

434
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:17,861
Our new Norton Internet security
suite has sonar behaviour

435
00:29:17,862 --> 00:29:21,050
based protection that defends against
any unknown online threats, so...

436
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,722
be sure to flag that feature
for undecided clients.

437
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,716
Okay, people. You heard her.

438
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,831
We're rolling this out immediately.
So uh...

439
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,495
Let's hop to it, hmm?!

440
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,299
Uh... Jen.

441
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,206
- Polished and concise as always.
- Thank you.

442
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:40,444
Don't change a word
when you go to San Francisco.

443
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:42,658
You want me to speak at
the conference?

444
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:45,632
No, I want you to dominate it.

445
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,488
Okay. All right.

446
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:50,647
You fly out tomorrow.

447
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:54,050
Oh, Mr. Newpar, tomorrow's umm...

448
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,895
It's such short notice.

449
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:58,530
There's no one else you can send?

450
00:30:05,522 --> 00:30:07,446
The conference isn't until
Monday just...

451
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,626
Take the weekend to prep.
You'll be fine.

452
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:10,296
Okay.

453
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:13,951
Of course, I didn't say that it was
Spencer’s birthday.

454
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:17,212
Because it is extremely
unprofessional to turn down a

455
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:19,412
business trip to
baby-sit your husband,

456
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,418
- birthday or not.
- And...

457
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:23,125
That's why I didn't mention it.

458
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:24,993
Can you take him out tonight or not?

459
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,771
Hello?

460
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,665
Dad?

461
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,248
<i>If I have to.</i>

462
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:32,296
Love you, sweetie.

463
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,405
I love you too. Bye.

464
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,842
No, no. It's too low.

465
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,103
Can you lift the back one up an inch?

466
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:47,030
- Right, no.
- Sweetie.

467
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,686
Right, right there. Perfect.

468
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:51,583
Can you come in tomorrow?
I'm sorry.

469
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:53,545
Mildred's having trouble
with the billing again.

470
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,084
Saturday, Mildred and bills.

471
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:57,504
- A trifecta.
- I'm sorry.

472
00:30:58,073 --> 00:30:59,316
- Thank you.
- Fine!

473
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:01,652
What do you think about this thing?

474
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,495
Well, Henry says
it's a statement piece.

475
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:09,743
Yeah, but is it stating that we like
ugly shit hanging from our ceiling?

476
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:11,856
Yep.

477
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,627
Yep, what?

478
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:17,403
Yes, you turned our conference room
into Bambi's nightmare.

479
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:18,335
Yeah, I know.

480
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,005
Hey! Listen, do me a favor. Grab some
flooring samples for Olivia all right?

481
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,007
Something durable that cleans up easy.

482
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,796
In case we decide to have
sex on the floor.

483
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:27,466
Of course.

484
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,705
You're worried she'll vomit?

485
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:32,912
I like her even more when
she's mean to me.

486
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,226
You're going to be a law suit.

487
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,477
Probably.

488
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,271
She gets aggravated though you know

489
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,022
when I flirt with other women.
That's what it is.

490
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,985
You do realize that only happens
in pornos.

491
00:31:41,995 --> 00:31:43,811
Yeah! The good pornos.

492
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:45,327
I'm gonna give her a shot.

493
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,137
Soon as I'm done letting Olivia
do dirty things to me.

494
00:31:48,147 --> 00:31:50,508
That's going to take a while.
Olivia's a bigger slut than you are.

495
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:52,774
Hey! Are we going to pretend to play
basketball tonight or what?

496
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,131
No can do. I've got dinner with Jen.

497
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,833
Ahhh! I think I just saw your
balls roll by.

498
00:31:57,868 --> 00:31:59,382
Yeah? You wanna go catch them for me?

499
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,832
Ugh! Just crushed it.

500
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,630
Just crushed one of your
balls right there.

501
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:05,423
We'll see.

502
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,077
Call me "ball crusher" from now on.

503
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:43,848
So! How'd it go?

504
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:46,875
Too good. Newpar is sending me
to San Francisco.

505
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:49,287
No, no. Not the presentation.
Spencer's gift?

506
00:32:50,082 --> 00:32:51,132
What did he say about the trip?

507
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:53,050
He wants to stay home and eat cobbler.

508
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,020
No vacation? No French getaway?

509
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,640
No!

510
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,759
Who in their right mind,
turns down a vacation like that?

511
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,577
Well, you know Spence.
He's kind of a home body.

512
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,537
Okay, okay... okay.

513
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:06,618
How long have you two been married?
What like three years?

514
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,569
- Yeah.
- Okay.

515
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,029
That's your problem.

516
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,489
I have a problem?

517
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,491
Everyone always talks about the
seven year itch.

518
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,035
But no one mentions the
three year snooze.

519
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,954
People get complacent.

520
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,915
Get relaxed
but you have to be vigilant.

521
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,558
Okay, otherwise you're growing out
your leg hair.

522
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:23,377
You're growing out your "down there"
hair, you're wearing your fat jeans

523
00:33:23,387 --> 00:33:25,442
and a pair of Spanx, okay?

524
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,847
And the next thing you know,
he runs off with

525
00:33:26,857 --> 00:33:29,409
a reality TV star named Shawnda, okay?

526
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,264
And that's my personal experience
but I'm telling you.

527
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,702
You better watch out
because Shawnda speaks six languages

528
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:34,892
and one of those languages

529
00:33:34,902 --> 00:33:36,942
...is sex. Are you going to eat that?

530
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,351
Getting hungz...
Super hungz over here.

531
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,088
<i>Peach Plaza Motel.</i>

532
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,485
Ah yes. I’m trying to
reach a guest named...

533
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:16,972
<i>- Sir?
Yes, uh...</i>

534
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:21,560
Yes, the guest named Annabell Hensler.

535
00:34:22,243 --> 00:34:23,335
<i>Just a moment.</i>

536
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,724
<i>Well, it took you long enough.
We need to meet.</i>

537
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,279
That's not going to happen, Annabell.

538
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,991
Now I get that you love being this
soft, suburban zombie

539
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:39,082
<i>but like I told you 3 years
ago in Nice,</i>

540
00:34:39,092 --> 00:34:41,371
<i>you can't just walk
away from this game.</i>

541
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,048
<i>I've got a job for you kiddo.</i>

542
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,429
I'm out. You're going to have
to find somebody else

543
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,414
to clean up your mess.

544
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,963
<i>My mess! If you don't do this job,
it'll be your mess.</i>

545
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:52,305
I'm in room 114.

546
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,508
I'll be waiting for you.

547
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,395
<i>- Just do what I'm telling you.
- Spencer!</i>

548
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,264
<i>- Spencer.
- Hey!</i>

549
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:00,226
<i>Spencer.</i>

550
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:02,816
Did you just hang up on someone?

551
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:04,138
Nope!

552
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:08,408
Jenn's tied up at work so
I'm supposed to do

553
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:12,000
something nice for your birthday,
so... here I am.

554
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:13,737
I'm going to feed you.

555
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,155
Oh boy, that's great.

556
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:17,247
But really, I can just grab
something real simple.

557
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,543
Are you saying you would
rather eat alone?

558
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:20,362
Nope.

559
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:24,289
- Of course not.
- I... let's break some bread.

560
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,211
Who's "H"?

561
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,547
My old boss.

562
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,599
Just asked me if I want my
old job back.

563
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:39,655
He sent you hugs and kisses.

564
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:41,056
Yup.

565
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:42,655
It's a French thing.

566
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,438
You know always kissing... fruits.

567
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:48,527
I can't take you to dinner dressed
like a street urchin so...

568
00:35:48,852 --> 00:35:51,858
We'll stop by your house and
pick up adult apparel.

569
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,944
I'll leave my car here.

570
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,862
I will meet you out front.

571
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,650
What's with you?

572
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,798
You're like a chained recess monkey
at the wheel.

573
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,701
Just excited about the two
of us grabbing dinner, huh.

574
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,145
You and Mrs. K. still thinking about
going on that cruise?

575
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:31,367
Yes.

576
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:36,027
Where are you going to go?

577
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,171
I really think that's up to
the Captain Spencer.

578
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:57,776
What's with you kids?

579
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:01,382
Jen shouldn't be coming home to
a dark house. It's not safe.

580
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,762
I couldn't agree with you more sir.

581
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,850
Did I leave my keys in the truck?

582
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,810
I am not telepathic, Spencer.

583
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,109
Maybe I'll just...

584
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:13,607
This is not Candyland,
unlocked trucks get stolen.

585
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:17,235
Which is why careful men,
use the garage.

586
00:37:18,495 --> 00:37:21,031
- Thank you sir.
- The keys are in the ignition.

587
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:32,209
Surprise!!!

588
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:42,311
You got me good! All right.

589
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:47,098
I told you I wouldn't throw
you a party...

590
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,893
on my birthday. Right.
That's very cute.

591
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:52,437
Not what you were expecting, right?

592
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:53,355
No.

593
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,105
Okay!

594
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:54,614
All right.

595
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,699
I... you know what...

596
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,110
I'm going to run upstairs and
change really quick.

597
00:37:57,111 --> 00:37:58,830
Okay, we'll be down here waiting
when you come back.

598
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,467
Surprise!!!

599
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,415
Good job, daddy!

600
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,267
<i>Good evening, Peach Plaza Motel.</i>

601
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:19,548
Yes, can you connect me with
Annabell Hensler please.

602
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,882
<i>One moment.</i>

603
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:28,428
<i>No answer sir.
Would you like to leave a message?</i>

604
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:29,197
No.

605
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,549
No. No message.

606
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:37,472
Well, I got a lot going on
and that so,

607
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,860
I don't know if I'm going to make it...
- We should hang out more.

608
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,153
- We should.
- Yes!

609
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,711
I'm going to go to the bathroom
real quick.

610
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:44,281
Yeah, yeah. I'll join you.

611
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:46,498
Mama!

612
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,480
Oh sweetheart!

613
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,994
Oh dear.

614
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:51,504
I was just telling Jen how you
were going to come over tomorrow.

615
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:52,851
We can't let you
spend your birthday alone.

616
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:55,494
I've got the Block party.

617
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,295
We could come with you.

618
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,733
Yeah...

619
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,131
Perfect!

620
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,090
Great!

621
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,503
I'm coming, you lush!

622
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,353
Oh, Henry might be staying the night.
- Uh huh.

623
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:10,307
I'm telling you, smoke on the water.
This chick was electrified.

624
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,268
Pow! Snap! Pop! Whooo!!

625
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,936
- Ha ha ha ha.
- Okay.

626
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,155
- I need to get a fill up.
- Uh huh.

627
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,572
You got something there
you think I might like?

628
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:26,540
I'll see you guys in a minute.

629
00:39:26,545 --> 00:39:28,867
<i>...or something you might like.
It's your party.</i>

630
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,368
You get to have whatever you want.

631
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,267
Uhh... wine?

632
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:34,289
Having fun?

633
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,600
I'm uhh...

634
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,127
I'll go open it.

635
00:39:37,128 --> 00:39:39,054
I'll be here with a birthday
kiss when you get back.

636
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,567
I just hope that it was a
good surprise, you know?

637
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,173
He seems kind of distracted.

638
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,980
He wasn't expecting a house full
of people. Cut him some slack.

639
00:39:47,457 --> 00:39:49,543
Maybe Kristen is right about
the 3 year thing.

640
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,386
You would tell me right?
You wouldn't sugar coat it

641
00:39:51,396 --> 00:39:53,166
cause with things like that,
it's just better to know.

642
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:55,433
I mean, my legs aren't hairy
but, I have been in my

643
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,221
fat jeans for the last
two weeks which...

644
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,834
Maybe why he would rather
stay home and make cobbler

645
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:01,605
than go on vacation with me.
Oh my God.

646
00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:03,699
- I really am freaking out.
- What's going on with you guys?

647
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,405
You got her all freaked out at lunch.

648
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,753
Are you still having sex with Spencer?
Yes or no?

649
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:11,793
Yeah, all the time.

650
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,360
Then your marriage is fine.

651
00:40:14,293 --> 00:40:16,498
Guys can we please play charades now?
Come on.

652
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:28,635
Are you sure you're all right?

653
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:29,678
Yeah yeah, I'm okay.

654
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:31,716
- Okay. Alright.
- Okay!

655
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:32,889
Watch the steps!

656
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,172
Walk home!
He really shouldn't be driving.

657
00:40:35,173 --> 00:40:36,379
Yeah, he's fine.

658
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,597
- Oooh...
- Aaah!

659
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,411
No no babe. I got it.

660
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,988
No honey no. I got it.

661
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:44,965
I'll put the house to bed.

662
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,113
You've got to start packing.

663
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:48,288
- Babe, it's your birthday.
- I got it.

664
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,916
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

665
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:54,236
Okay, just do the bare minimum,
I'll get the rest in the morning.

666
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:55,184
I love you.

667
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,762
Thank you. I love you!

668
00:40:56,772 --> 00:40:58,398
Where are your pants?

669
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,522
- Is something wrong?
- Huh?

670
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:30,732
No, of course not.

671
00:41:31,977 --> 00:41:32,845
Are you sure?

672
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:36,953
I mean, is everything okay between us?

673
00:41:38,494 --> 00:41:39,774
You're kidding, right?

674
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:45,045
Come here. Come here. This the spot?

675
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:51,593
Maybe I could skip the Cornfield
packing method just this once.

676
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:54,732
Your flights early,
you should keep packing.

677
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:49,482
I should have just told Newpar
I'd go tomorrow.

678
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,588
I feel terrible missing your birthday.

679
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:52,036
No worries.
I've got another one next year.

680
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,700
Well, hold on.

681
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,785
You need your birthday kiss.

682
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,427
Okay!

683
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,505
We don't want the neighbors
to get jealous.

684
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,843
Throwing a little porno in
the driveway.

685
00:43:14,878 --> 00:43:16,094
Don't want you to be late,

686
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:16,940
for the airport.

687
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:17,960
- Better get you going.
- Okay!

688
00:43:19,301 --> 00:43:20,351
...miss your flight.

689
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:21,933
There we go!

690
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,314
Hey Jen!

691
00:43:28,056 --> 00:43:28,734
Jen!

692
00:43:29,096 --> 00:43:31,740
- Hey! Jen.
- Hey Jackie.

693
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,622
You're up early for a party animal.

694
00:43:34,058 --> 00:43:35,624
Oh yeah,
I'm just runnning off to the airport.

695
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,513
My Doggie says its a good
thing that we're such sound sleepers

696
00:43:38,514 --> 00:43:40,161
because you know a lot
of other people might have

697
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:40,869
an issue with all that noise.

698
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:45,061
Any who. Doggy wants to talk
to Spence about this whole

699
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:48,175
fence on the property line
bruhauhau we're having.

700
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,046
We don't want to bring lawyers into it
any more than you do, right?

701
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,590
But, we're quite sure our new fence
is not on your land.

702
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,775
- You know, you understand.
- Oh yeah perfectly, of course but you

703
00:43:56,785 --> 00:43:59,108
understand you're gonna have to
take it up with Spence, right?

704
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,013
Okay?

705
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:03,016
Thanks Jackie, I'm sorry.
I'm in a big rush. See you soon.

706
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,142
Okay, you're late.

707
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,620
Hey, did you guys have fun last night?

708
00:44:08,622 --> 00:44:10,065
Oh yeah, it was great.

709
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,192
Of course,
I'm paying for it this morning.

710
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:14,806
You're still taking Spence out
tonight though, right?

711
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,655
Yes, for the hundredth time.

712
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:17,197
Good.

713
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,907
Okay, did daddy promise to
be nice to him?

714
00:44:20,345 --> 00:44:22,355
Hmmm... not in so many words.

715
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,207
Just get yourself on the plane.
Let us take care of Spence, okay?

716
00:44:27,242 --> 00:44:29,263
Okay... well, I'll call you
when I get to San Francisco.

717
00:44:29,273 --> 00:44:30,168
Love you.

718
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,378
<i>Love you too dear, bye.</i>

719
00:44:36,088 --> 00:44:36,588
Mmmmm.

720
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,636
What was that? You or me?

721
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,076
That's me.

722
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,244
That's you.

723
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:06,698
Here you go.

724
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:08,373
You got any milk?

725
00:45:08,615 --> 00:45:09,749
Yeah.

726
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,293
Everything all right?

727
00:45:11,328 --> 00:45:11,960
Yeah.

728
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:17,695
What do I got?
I've got some skim milk and...

729
00:45:17,696 --> 00:45:19,551
I've got some low fat yogurt.

730
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:21,959
You know what you can do?
You can mix the two together.

731
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:26,683
What the hell are you doing man?

732
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,351
You should have seen your face.

733
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,729
You almost crapped your pants.

734
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,521
Yeah, it's really funny...

735
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:39,112
What are you doing?

736
00:45:39,147 --> 00:45:40,113
Killing you buddy.

737
00:46:00,232 --> 00:46:01,832
Where are you going Spence, huh?

738
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:04,781
You got a gun upstairs or something?

739
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:42,662
Surprise! I'm back.

740
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,679
Spence?

741
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,998
What are you doing!?

742
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:55,637
Spencer! Stop it!

743
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:57,440
Stop! You're hurting him.

744
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,692
I need you to give me something.

745
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,219
Stop it.
Upstairs, in the bedside table...

746
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:03,341
- There's a Glock.45
- A Glock?!

747
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,071
A gun! Just go get it!

748
00:47:05,081 --> 00:47:06,928
- Why do you have a gun?!
- Just get it!

749
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,388
I'm coming, I'm coming...

750
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:25,716
- I kind of need you to hurry.
- Okay, okay, I'm here.

751
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:28,608
Your job right now.
I need you to point the gun at him...

752
00:47:28,618 --> 00:47:29,736
and shoot him in the face.

753
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:30,234
What?!

754
00:47:30,235 --> 00:47:32,174
Don't do it, he's gone crazy.
It's a psychotic break...

755
00:47:32,175 --> 00:47:33,275
Don't do it!

756
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:34,461
Just shoot him!

757
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:37,580
Okay.

758
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,270
Oww!! Bitch shot me.

759
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,115
What, are you crazy?!

760
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,034
You told me to shoot him in the face.

761
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,763
Yeah, I didn't think you were
really going to shoot.

762
00:47:50,773 --> 00:47:52,157
I was telling you to divert his...

763
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:54,998
Well, then you should have waved or
crossed your fingers or something.

764
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,125
I was a little busy trying not to die.

765
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:58,377
- Oh God, I shot him.
- It's all right.

766
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,586
He's just knocked out, he's not dead.

767
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:01,041
It's okay.
I need you to go to the basement

768
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:02,515
and get the duct tape.

769
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,634
There's duct tape downstairs.
Go downstairs and get the duct tape.

770
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,481
- I can't move.
- Come on babe.

771
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,346
- I can't move!
- It's okay.

772
00:48:09,356 --> 00:48:09,973
It's okay!

773
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,056
It's okay.

774
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,766
It's okay, he's going to be okay.

775
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:14,676
Maybe.

776
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:19,516
Spence?

777
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,732
What is happening?

778
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,364
I'm about to find out.

779
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,782
- Ahhh!!! Stop.
- Wake up.

780
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:30,248
- Owwwww!!!
- You're hurting him.

781
00:48:30,258 --> 00:48:32,166
Yeah, I think he'll be all right.

782
00:48:36,265 --> 00:48:37,582
Sorry, I'm bleeding on your chair.

783
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,626
You just had it reupholstered, right?

784
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:40,460
Yeah.

785
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:44,497
You were under contract.

786
00:48:45,441 --> 00:48:46,889
Contract for what? The business?

787
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,799
Somebody hired him to kill me.

788
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:52,452
Oh my God!

789
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:54,351
I thought we were friends.

790
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,512
Really? Because you never
seemed that invested.

791
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:58,521
Owww!!!

792
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:01,091
I covered for you
with every client that we have.

793
00:49:01,092 --> 00:49:04,818
I talked a half a dozen hussy
girls out of slashing your tires.

794
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,550
I even drove you to the free clinic
when your balls were

795
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:10,303
swollen and you had that fungal thing!

796
00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:14,077
- No, no no no.
- I helped you bury "Sir Barks-a-lot."

797
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,532
Hey. He was a good dog, all right.

798
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:17,699
Leave him out of this.

799
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:19,124
He couldn't fetch for shit.

800
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:19,980
Spencer.

801
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:20,750
Yeah?

802
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:23,920
By the end of the day, you're going
to be just as dead as he is.

803
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:26,715
You got a 20 million dollar bounty
on your head.

804
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:31,699
Oh God!

805
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:33,430
Are you going to faint?

806
00:49:34,414 --> 00:49:36,183
Unless I puke first.

807
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:37,321
Breathe.

808
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:38,768
It's okay.

809
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,697
How is this okay?

810
00:49:41,036 --> 00:49:42,773
I'll explain. Just not right now.

811
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:45,891
No, you explain now!
I want you to explain right now!

812
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:48,820
Jen?

813
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:50,113
Spence?

814
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:53,874
Hello?

815
00:49:54,134 --> 00:49:57,324
Yeah, that’s it. Be very quiet.

816
00:49:57,496 --> 00:49:59,664
Maybe the other assassin will go away.

817
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:02,709
Yoo-hoo! They could be any
of your neighbors.

818
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:04,447
Come out, come out wherever you are.

819
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:05,570
What?

820
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,768
You didn't think I'd have
some competition?

821
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:12,594
- $20 million buys a lot of patience.
- Helloooooo!

822
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:15,305
I can see your car.

823
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:18,354
Spencer, it's just Jackie Valero.

824
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:20,560
I know you're in there.

825
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:22,729
She just wants to talk about the
property line or something.

826
00:50:22,764 --> 00:50:24,074
Or... kill you.

827
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:29,351
Hello you two, hello?

828
00:50:30,064 --> 00:50:31,554
I want to talk about the fence.

829
00:50:32,973 --> 00:50:33,557
What do we do?

830
00:50:33,558 --> 00:50:34,483
Go.

831
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:39,054
- What about him?
- Oh no no!

832
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:41,540
- Spencer, stop.
- If I don't, he'll come after us.

833
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,291
He's our friend.

834
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:43,917
He's a liar.

835
00:50:59,986 --> 00:51:01,415
- Put your seatbelt on.
- I am, I am.

836
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:06,481
Jen!

837
00:51:06,523 --> 00:51:08,525
Jen! What's going on?

838
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:13,113
...my gun.
- I can tell.

839
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:14,614
Jen, everything all right?

840
00:51:26,026 --> 00:51:26,897
Good morning.

841
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:32,514
Slow down!

842
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:34,551
Stop the car right there,
I am getting out right now!

843
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:35,851
Sit down!

844
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:38,221
I have a right to freak out,
I don't even know who the hell you're!

845
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:38,972
It's me.

846
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:40,557
I just have a different resume.

847
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:41,808
Who do you work for?

848
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,024
Is it the Mob?

849
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:45,187
I can't tell you. If I tell you,
they could kill you too.

850
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:48,990
Let's just say that I work for
the blah, blah, blah

851
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:51,151
and they gave me a license to blah.

852
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:54,571
I need air.
I need air right now.

853
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:55,649
- Honey...
- My God!

854
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:56,893
It was never my primary directive.

855
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,675
- Are we even married? I mean...
- Yes,

856
00:51:58,676 --> 00:51:59,611
- legally married?
- we're married.

857
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:01,521
- I got out.
...not married in your heart?

858
00:52:01,531 --> 00:52:02,954
I got out in France.

859
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:06,082
- I was in a love bubble in France.
- I was in a love bubble too...

860
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:19,638
I've got something for you Spence.

861
00:52:22,427 --> 00:52:23,981
- Spread your legs.
- Oh no!

862
00:52:23,982 --> 00:52:26,088
- You are not getting off that easy.
- Spread 'em!!

863
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:30,896
- Okay. Oh my God.
- Here. Hold this.

864
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:34,288
Hold on.

865
00:52:53,038 --> 00:52:55,131
He's on my side. He's on my side.

866
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:06,518
Oh cool! Race cars.

867
00:53:26,346 --> 00:53:27,914
Damn!

868
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:29,374
That got him.

869
00:53:31,018 --> 00:53:31,501
You okay?

870
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:32,627
- Mmm hmm.
- Alright.

871
00:53:32,907 --> 00:53:34,214
He's going to be close behind.

872
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:47,039
- Oh God!
- Hide.

873
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:48,517
- What?
- Hide now!

874
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,678
What are you going to do?

875
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:56,067
I'm going to kill him.

876
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:59,130
Whoa!!!

877
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:15,272
Spence?

878
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:21,403
Spencer.

879
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:34,708
Get in the truck.

880
00:55:36,017 --> 00:55:36,751
Is he?

881
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:37,586
Yeah.

882
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:43,049
Start talking.

883
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,183
I was recruited in college,
freshman year.

884
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:53,984
Why did they choose you?

885
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:57,522
They look for independent people.
And after my parents passed...

886
00:55:57,557 --> 00:55:59,524
I didn't have any family. So...

887
00:56:04,196 --> 00:56:05,197
We've gotta go babe.

888
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,659
You can be pissed at me in the truck.

889
00:56:10,744 --> 00:56:11,953
Are you going to kill me too?

890
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:13,705
Come on.
If I was going to kill you,

891
00:56:13,706 --> 00:56:15,415
I would have shot you
back at the house.

892
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,209
Uh... that...

893
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:19,598
Sounded weird, I...

894
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:22,464
Logically, you know that...
that's true.

895
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,592
Okay.

896
00:56:32,766 --> 00:56:34,685
- Spread 'em.
- For God's sake,

897
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:36,603
what else do you have down there?

898
00:56:42,075 --> 00:56:43,485
How many people Spencer?

899
00:56:47,013 --> 00:56:47,663
Four...

900
00:56:48,698 --> 00:56:50,408
...teen.

901
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:53,745
Fifteen. It's fifteen.

902
00:56:56,832 --> 00:56:58,896
Is fifteen your real number
or is that like when

903
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:00,961
you ask a girl how many
guy's she's slept with

904
00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:02,643
and you have to double
in and times it by ten?

905
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:08,927
- I didn't do that. I'm just...
- Fifteen is my number.

906
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:12,472
And they were all bad guys
as far as I know.

907
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:14,683
But it was getting harder to tell.

908
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:16,768
And then I met you.

909
00:57:18,426 --> 00:57:19,980
And we fell in love and I got out.

910
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:28,321
Well, my boss reached out
to me yesterday.

911
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:30,266
He's staying in a hotel, Peach Plaza.

912
00:57:32,373 --> 00:57:33,368
He'll know what's going on.

913
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:50,350
Sweetie...

914
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:51,341
your gun is showing.

915
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,305
Where do you expect me to put it?

916
00:57:53,346 --> 00:57:55,307
Have you seen the size of this thing?

917
00:58:14,034 --> 00:58:15,577
Oh, it's my dad.

918
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:16,369
Should I take it?

919
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,546
I thought you said you were going
to change that?

920
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:34,638
Sweetheart, relax.

921
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:37,557
It's a little early to check on
Spencer, don't you think?

922
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:40,685
And Jen will just be getting settled
at the hotel.

923
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:43,087
Yeah.

924
00:58:43,097 --> 00:58:43,939
You're right.

925
00:58:57,661 --> 00:58:58,078
Spence?

926
00:58:58,119 --> 00:58:59,496
I got the...

927
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:20,809
Easy...

928
00:59:21,405 --> 00:59:23,660
It's my old boss, Holbrook.

929
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:28,024
Two to the heart, one in the head.

930
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:31,236
It's old school training.
Had to be an experienced hitter.

931
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:36,616
All right.

932
00:59:36,658 --> 00:59:38,910
Judging from his body,
it happened earlier this morning.

933
00:59:39,995 --> 00:59:40,412
It's okay.

934
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:41,746
It's the adrenaline.

935
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:43,123
You're going in a little bit.

936
00:59:43,165 --> 00:59:45,375
How can you talk about him like that?
You knew him.

937
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:47,043
It's my training baby.

938
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:48,837
Sorry.

939
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:53,758
Spence, I can't stay here.

940
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,051
I think I'm going to get sick.

941
00:59:55,093 --> 00:59:57,179
Just give me a second baby.

942
00:59:57,832 --> 00:59:58,722
Gotta have some information

943
00:59:58,757 --> 01:00:00,348
about the target.

944
01:00:02,105 --> 01:00:03,206
You already looked there.

945
01:00:05,453 --> 01:00:06,782
I'm missing something.

946
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:13,637
It's the watch.

947
01:00:14,771 --> 01:00:15,544
It's wrong.

948
01:00:17,112 --> 01:00:20,267
He'd never wear anything this flashy.
Nothing to get noticed.

949
01:00:23,456 --> 01:00:24,915
Look at this.

950
01:00:25,524 --> 01:00:27,739
- It's broken. Who cares?
- No no.

951
01:00:27,759 --> 01:00:31,630
It's a plug in for like a flash drive
or something. It's missing.

952
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:34,132
You're right.
Someone's taken the drive.

953
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:37,162
Okay! All right.

954
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,221
Let's go.

955
01:00:47,263 --> 01:00:49,181
Do you think that Henry
got to Holbrook?

956
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:52,875
No, Henry was in agreement
until this morning.

957
01:00:53,435 --> 01:00:54,793
There was another shooter
at the house.

958
01:00:55,093 --> 01:00:56,304
I think we need to get out of here.

959
01:00:56,493 --> 01:00:57,269
Absolutely.

960
01:00:57,369 --> 01:00:58,466
And go to my parents.

961
01:00:59,150 --> 01:00:59,936
- No.
- Yes!

962
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,580
- No!
- Yes!

963
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,883
My dad will know what to do.

964
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:06,341
I used to do this for a living, okay.
We do not want to

965
01:01:06,342 --> 01:01:07,711
involve your parents.
And we definitely

966
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:09,469
- don't need help from your dad.
- I think we do.

967
01:01:09,751 --> 01:01:10,749
Because your plan

968
01:01:10,759 --> 01:01:13,255
to kill Henry and come see a dead guy.
It's not really working out.

969
01:01:14,506 --> 01:01:15,616
I should have seen this coming.

970
01:01:15,913 --> 01:01:17,806
Of course you're going to
rope your parents into this.

971
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:19,684
Oh! You are a spy and a double agent

972
01:01:19,685 --> 01:01:22,185
but I'm the bad guy because
I want to call my parents. Really?

973
01:01:22,285 --> 01:01:23,400
We've been married for three years

974
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:24,563
and we've never been more

975
01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:25,824
- than 5 minutes...
- Do you want to do this right now?

976
01:01:25,825 --> 01:01:27,201
- away from your parents.
- Come on now.

977
01:01:27,456 --> 01:01:29,745
They're always coming over
and your dad's all

978
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,401
well, like...

979
01:01:30,544 --> 01:01:33,156
"This is how the Cornfields load
the dishwasher" and

980
01:01:33,191 --> 01:01:35,790
"Mow the lawn clockwise, because
that's the Cornfield way."

981
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,863
"Take this piece of coal,
stick it up your keester."

982
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:40,532
"Squeeze it real tight like we do
and you'll make a Cornfield diamond."

983
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:42,489
Okay now, hold up a minute.
You're talking about my parents.

984
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,578
Jen, I'm your husband.

985
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:46,399
What are we going to do when
we have our own kids?

986
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,378
Jen, just talk to me.

987
01:01:54,388 --> 01:01:55,397
If you could just talk to me
for a second.

988
01:01:55,398 --> 01:01:56,794
I take it back, I love your parents.

989
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,147
I'm sending them a mental
hug right now. Look!

990
01:02:00,157 --> 01:02:02,387
Spencer! Hey... you okay?

991
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:03,305
Yeah, I'm good.

992
01:02:03,555 --> 01:02:04,289
Yeah!

993
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,429
Your garage. It's... it's a wreck.

994
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:10,031
- Yeah, it was a party foul it...
- You do realize we

995
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:13,557
have the Block party tonight and
its a... it's a real eyesore.

996
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:14,719
Well, then don't look at it, Pete!

997
01:02:22,058 --> 01:02:23,943
You can't just run off like that.

998
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:25,647
You make it impossible for me
to protect you.

999
01:02:26,055 --> 01:02:27,164
A little late for protection.

1000
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:33,928
Think about it. My emotions are all
over the place.

1001
01:02:33,929 --> 01:02:36,393
I'm picking up smells that half
the K-9 unit would miss.

1002
01:02:36,394 --> 01:02:39,105
Plus, I pretty much feel like vomiting
every time I breathe.

1003
01:02:39,646 --> 01:02:40,779
It's been a stressful day.

1004
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:41,727
Explain these...

1005
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,497
Aren't they always that big?

1006
01:02:49,536 --> 01:02:50,843
You take the pill every day.

1007
01:02:50,844 --> 01:02:52,672
I know, but I had strep last month,
remember?

1008
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:55,175
I had to take a Z pack.

1009
01:02:55,187 --> 01:02:56,843
Antibiotics knock out the pill.
That's why I told you we

1010
01:02:56,844 --> 01:02:58,198
- had to be careful.
- I thought you were talking about

1011
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:58,964
my technique,

1012
01:02:58,966 --> 01:02:59,926
- not getting knocked up.
- Okay, you know what.

1013
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,526
- Don't yell at me, sureshot.
- I'm not.

1014
01:03:01,536 --> 01:03:04,351
You're the one who suggested
'Naked Saturdays.'

1015
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:06,787
Can I help you?

1016
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:09,109
Stop it.

1017
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,928
- What? She's staring at us.
- You don't...

1018
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:12,304
- Staring is rude.
- You know what?

1019
01:03:12,345 --> 01:03:15,133
Can we just... we're not in a library
here. Let's just pick up the pace.

1020
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:17,092
Well, they're not all
equally accurate, okay?

1021
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,953
Well, it's just crazy to stand
out here in the aisle so...

1022
01:03:18,954 --> 01:03:21,115
Take one. Take them all.
I don't know? Who cares?

1023
01:03:21,116 --> 01:03:23,816
I care. I care Spence.
It would be awesome

1024
01:03:23,826 --> 01:03:26,825
to know if I am actually
making a little being

1025
01:03:26,835 --> 01:03:28,913
inside of me, okay?
And don't you call me crazy!

1026
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:30,725
I'm not calling you crazy.

1027
01:03:30,726 --> 01:03:32,476
The scenario is crazy,
standing here is crazy.

1028
01:03:32,477 --> 01:03:33,831
You know what? You're not helping.

1029
01:03:34,065 --> 01:03:36,284
Uh... folks?
Could I be of some assistance?

1030
01:03:37,284 --> 01:03:37,634
Yes!

1031
01:03:38,753 --> 01:03:40,379
Yes, you can.

1032
01:03:40,588 --> 01:03:41,642
Ahh... uhh...

1033
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:43,091
Kevin...

1034
01:03:44,059 --> 01:03:45,754
Which one of these is the
most accurate?

1035
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:48,640
Jen. I don't think
he's a pregnancy test expert.

1036
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,370
Well...

1037
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,502
<i>First Response seems to
be pretty popular uh...</i>

1038
01:03:55,544 --> 01:03:58,707
...can't seem to keep it on the
shelf. Here you go.

1039
01:03:59,987 --> 01:04:00,597
Okay.

1040
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,469
- Must be your first.
- Pregnancy test?

1041
01:04:04,017 --> 01:04:04,203
Baby.

1042
01:04:04,495 --> 01:04:05,619
Oh, yeah.

1043
01:04:09,184 --> 01:04:10,372
Well, it may be your lucky day.

1044
01:04:15,004 --> 01:04:15,439
Stop it.

1045
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:17,423
Look at that. It's on sale.

1046
01:04:18,699 --> 01:04:19,652
Great!

1047
01:04:20,326 --> 01:04:21,040
That's great.

1048
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:28,759
- Let's go.
- Thank you so much. Thanks.

1049
01:04:29,058 --> 01:04:30,158
I'm coming.

1050
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,668
No judging.

1051
01:04:37,284 --> 01:04:39,965
I need to follow protocol,
report Holbrook's termination.

1052
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,747
I'll get a safe house.

1053
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:43,884
You'll be protected there

1054
01:04:43,919 --> 01:04:45,928
and I can figure out

1055
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:47,429
who Holbrook's target was.

1056
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,057
Maybe find out
who set this whole thing in motion.

1057
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:53,257
As long as I get to pee on the stick
and eat my delicious jerky, I'm in.

1058
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:54,381
Great.

1059
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:57,474
Listen, there's one more thing.

1060
01:04:58,672 --> 01:05:01,452
You can't be upset...
I need to steal a car.

1061
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:03,738
- The truck's shot to shit.
- It will be the least awful

1062
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:06,440
thing we do all day so... go for it...

1063
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:15,457
Honey, I'm eating like I just got
home from Fat Camp.

1064
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:17,355
I'm glad you said it.

1065
01:05:19,069 --> 01:05:19,783
Really?

1066
01:05:20,304 --> 01:05:23,153
You want to poke Mama Bear right now?
That seems like a good idea?

1067
01:05:23,163 --> 01:05:25,460
- Hey, you're kind of scary right now.
- Just make your phone call.

1068
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:30,445
<i>You are a go for contact.</i>

1069
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,833
This is Zulu one four niner. Sierra
one zero zero's been forcibly retired

1070
01:05:34,835 --> 01:05:38,089
prior to contact. Please advise
a secure location for briefing.

1071
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,056
<i>Hold for further instructions.</i>

1072
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:45,178
- Zulu one four niner?
- It's my code name.

1073
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:48,991
It's just not very catchy.

1074
01:05:49,913 --> 01:05:52,411
Sorry, all the cool code names
were taken.

1075
01:05:53,504 --> 01:05:57,281
<i>Zulu one four niner. Please confirm
your contact and his status.</i>

1076
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:00,436
Sierra one zero zero and
his status is dead

1077
01:06:00,437 --> 01:06:02,591
and I believe his target
has put a hit on me.

1078
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:05,822
<i>Negative. Sierra one zero zero
has no target.</i>

1079
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:08,820
<i>He is no longer an active agent.
Please provide</i>

1080
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:10,299
<i>your location and coordinate.</i>

1081
01:06:15,979 --> 01:06:17,039
What happened?

1082
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,239
Something's not right.

1083
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:19,574
Where are you going?

1084
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:21,954
To search Henry's stuff.
See if we can find out who hired him.

1085
01:06:21,964 --> 01:06:23,428
Maybe there's a connection
to Holbrook.

1086
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,737
Oh and you could do your... pee thing.

1087
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,239
I got it.

1088
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:34,883
I'm in.

1089
01:06:38,238 --> 01:06:44,283
- Porn... porn... porn... Poooooorn.
- Porn.

1090
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:48,605
People are so inventive.

1091
01:06:50,021 --> 01:06:52,029
- They're like propped up there and...
- Okay.

1092
01:06:55,788 --> 01:06:57,024
Okay, how weird is this going to get?

1093
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:59,520
Because there are some things
that you cannot unsee.

1094
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:01,897
It's a picture of Henry's dog,
"Sir Barks-a-lot."

1095
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:03,148
In costume?

1096
01:07:09,163 --> 01:07:09,936
Wait a minute.

1097
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,935
Look at the size of these files.

1098
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:17,788
Oh my God.

1099
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:21,750
These are pictures from two years ago.

1100
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:24,336
I mean, this was the first Block party
we went to.

1101
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:29,716
Whoever set this up was patient
enough to embed Henry and

1102
01:07:29,717 --> 01:07:31,031
- God knows who else into my life.
- Our life.

1103
01:07:31,032 --> 01:07:32,136
Our life.

1104
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:37,641
Wait, wha...

1105
01:07:41,012 --> 01:07:42,688
I'm pretty sure your dad
took that one.

1106
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:49,131
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing, It's just an observation.

1107
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,418
Yes. An observation about my father
and that photo.

1108
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:54,158
Because it's a picture that he took.

1109
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:57,809
- Okay, so now my dad, is a bad guy.
- I definitely did not...

1110
01:07:57,819 --> 01:07:57,995
No no no.

1111
01:07:58,037 --> 01:07:58,960
You're right. You're right.

1112
01:07:58,961 --> 01:08:00,688
Because you're a liar... and a hitman.
- Oh... okay!

1113
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,540
- and everyone probably is too...
- Here we go.

1114
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,495
So I bet my mom's in on it

1115
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,726
and Granny Cornfield.

1116
01:08:05,736 --> 01:08:07,731
Yeah, I think she's just
messing with our minds with

1117
01:08:07,741 --> 01:08:09,354
the whole "I'm in a wheelchair bit!"

1118
01:08:09,967 --> 01:08:11,924
Okay, we are getting into some
counter productive

1119
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:13,678
territory here and...
I think we should move on to

1120
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:14,718
something else. Like...

1121
01:08:14,728 --> 01:08:18,942
Like... maybe we should piss on a
stick now? That would be a good idea.

1122
01:08:18,952 --> 01:08:20,567
It is a good idea because
I do have to pee.

1123
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:22,205
Grab my gun.

1124
01:08:23,138 --> 01:08:25,198
You can't just walk out and...

1125
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:28,388
You are aware that people are
trying to kill us.

1126
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:29,593
I really have to go.

1127
01:08:36,784 --> 01:08:38,056
Oh, for God's sake just turn
the light on.

1128
01:08:38,057 --> 01:08:39,723
It's not like there's a lot
of places to hide.

1129
01:08:39,724 --> 01:08:40,598
Just humour me.

1130
01:08:44,016 --> 01:08:44,712
Why... thanks.

1131
01:09:00,911 --> 01:09:03,479
I can't pee with you just standing
there staring at me.

1132
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:05,569
Honey, you've peed in front
of me a million times.

1133
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:07,654
But there's a little more
pressure now, don't you think?

1134
01:09:13,094 --> 01:09:13,680
Better?

1135
01:09:17,249 --> 01:09:17,685
No.

1136
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:19,975
No?

1137
01:09:26,337 --> 01:09:27,575
Ahhhh...

1138
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:35,073
Honey, can you please just give
me one minute?

1139
01:09:35,074 --> 01:09:36,140
It's going to take a minute.

1140
01:09:36,802 --> 01:09:37,959
You can guard the door.

1141
01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:05,127
- Hey!
- Hey.

1142
01:10:06,095 --> 01:10:06,824
You're here.

1143
01:10:06,834 --> 01:10:07,603
You're here!

1144
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:08,606
Oh God, look...

1145
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:11,934
There's a problem with the wind pipe
count June 2008.

1146
01:10:11,944 --> 01:10:14,548
The billing?
You might want to take a look at it.

1147
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:17,009
You know what?
Let's forget the billing.

1148
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,008
We'll just...
we'll take care of it on Monday.

1149
01:10:20,019 --> 01:10:20,824
Are you sure?

1150
01:10:20,834 --> 01:10:21,583
Yeah.

1151
01:10:22,143 --> 01:10:23,008
Okay.

1152
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,224
Great.

1153
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:56,882
Spence?

1154
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:45,512
Spence?

1155
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:27,071
Hey. You, you... stop it.

1156
01:12:28,497 --> 01:12:29,565
Stop it.

1157
01:12:35,339 --> 01:12:37,870
Honey, I don't know how... it's not,
it's not shooting.

1158
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:38,931
I don't... oh, fuck.

1159
01:12:56,637 --> 01:12:57,650
Are you okay?

1160
01:13:01,248 --> 01:13:02,883
Hey, are you all right?

1161
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,095
I'm out of ammo.

1162
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:11,739
Bullets before babies huh?

1163
01:13:13,871 --> 01:13:15,566
Ammo's kind of important right now.

1164
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:18,148
What's it say?

1165
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:23,433
What's two bars mean?

1166
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:26,796
Hey, you've got to translate
this for me.

1167
01:13:28,535 --> 01:13:29,135
Hey!

1168
01:13:30,674 --> 01:13:31,631
Am I going to be a dad?

1169
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:34,054
I'm going to be a mother

1170
01:13:34,428 --> 01:13:36,243
but I'm not sure yet if you're going
to be a father.

1171
01:13:44,572 --> 01:13:46,328
Jen, Jen...

1172
01:13:46,358 --> 01:13:47,565
I know you're upset.

1173
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,696
And you have every right to be,
but I can't change who I was.

1174
01:13:50,796 --> 01:13:52,094
Where does that leave us?

1175
01:13:53,691 --> 01:13:54,627
We'll figure it out.

1176
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:56,436
- How?
- I will keep you safe.

1177
01:13:56,446 --> 01:13:57,023
How?

1178
01:13:57,776 --> 01:13:59,111
Tell me how...

1179
01:13:59,211 --> 01:14:00,295
and I will stay.

1180
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,517
It's over, Spence.

1181
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:13,463
I know you don't want this to be over.

1182
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,714
What I wanted stopped mattering
the moment I saw those two bars.

1183
01:14:24,317 --> 01:14:25,017
Where are you going?

1184
01:14:30,274 --> 01:14:35,621
Jen... Jen. Jen!

1185
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:52,101
Oh!

1186
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:54,891
Oh... Olivia!

1187
01:15:07,707 --> 01:15:09,655
Henry, who is calling you?

1188
01:15:13,597 --> 01:15:14,639
You've got to be kidding me.

1189
01:15:20,345 --> 01:15:21,944
Hey Spence,
I've got a package for you.

1190
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:27,075
Relax buddy.

1191
01:15:27,085 --> 01:15:28,255
Try a little decaf.

1192
01:15:28,355 --> 01:15:29,839
Come on around the other side for me.

1193
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,971
I think it's that back ordered fabric
from Tuscan.

1194
01:15:41,289 --> 01:15:42,618
Sure took its sweet time
in getting here, huh?

1195
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:44,842
Yeah.

1196
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:50,353
I just need your signature
on the top there.

1197
01:15:51,913 --> 01:15:53,301
- Pen?
- Oh yeah.

1198
01:16:24,587 --> 01:16:25,761
I think I got him.

1199
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,214
Yeah, you got him.

1200
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:30,879
Oh God, I'm glad you're okay.
God, look at the windshield.

1201
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:33,074
You must have really pissed him off.

1202
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:48,559
Is anyone... not trying to kill me?

1203
01:17:30,056 --> 01:17:30,556
Thanks.

1204
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:35,147
Let's go steal a car.

1205
01:17:40,441 --> 01:17:41,511
So what do we do now?

1206
01:17:43,133 --> 01:17:43,792
I don't know.

1207
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,096
Maybe some couples counseling.

1208
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:51,603
No.

1209
01:17:52,202 --> 01:17:52,760
Now.

1210
01:17:53,505 --> 01:17:55,210
Spencer, what do we do? Right now.

1211
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,362
- Right! Right now...
- Right!

1212
01:17:56,462 --> 01:17:58,146
Right now we're going to go to
the house. I've got a Go bag.

1213
01:17:58,156 --> 01:18:00,573
We've got money, weapons, passports.
We're set.

1214
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:03,320
Why exactly do we have a Go bag,
Spencer?

1215
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:04,599
Did you know this was going to happen?

1216
01:18:05,913 --> 01:18:07,200
No. I didn't know.

1217
01:18:08,019 --> 01:18:08,914
You're lying.

1218
01:18:09,474 --> 01:18:10,610
You are lying.

1219
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,963
Am I telling you everything? No.

1220
01:18:12,973 --> 01:18:14,490
I'm not telling you everything. Okay.

1221
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,868
But we're married,
that's what married people do honey.

1222
01:18:16,888 --> 01:18:18,300
They lie to each other.

1223
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:21,421
They tell people things that
aren't true to keep them safe

1224
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:24,295
and to protect one another when they

1225
01:18:24,305 --> 01:18:26,473
ask things like if they have
their mother's arms.

1226
01:18:28,559 --> 01:18:30,680
Not that you have your mother's arms.
I'm not...

1227
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,503
- You lie to me.
- No, I didn't.

1228
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:34,192
- The first time we met.
- No, I didn't!

1229
01:18:34,202 --> 01:18:35,997
Unless your dad is a Russian pervert?

1230
01:18:36,402 --> 01:18:37,717
Well, I came clean about that.

1231
01:18:37,817 --> 01:18:38,811
You didn't.

1232
01:18:38,911 --> 01:18:40,274
You did not come clean.

1233
01:18:40,284 --> 01:18:41,468
- Did too.
- No, you didn't.

1234
01:18:41,478 --> 01:18:43,169
I told you...
I can't help that you were sleeping.

1235
01:18:43,269 --> 01:18:45,429
I didn't know that you sleep
like a dead person.

1236
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:47,636
- Come on!
- For all I know,

1237
01:18:47,646 --> 01:18:48,867
you heard everything I said.

1238
01:18:49,242 --> 01:18:50,345
Based on what?

1239
01:18:50,505 --> 01:18:52,715
Based on... your leg... was twitching.

1240
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:55,183
God, you know this is perfect.
This is just perfect.

1241
01:18:55,218 --> 01:18:57,262
You couldn't have been just
hiding Tranny porn in the Crawlspace

1242
01:18:57,263 --> 01:18:59,305
like Suzy Pratt's husband, Murray?

1243
01:19:00,452 --> 01:19:01,955
Really? Murray Pratt?

1244
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:05,812
No no no no, you... had to be a spy.

1245
01:19:06,453 --> 01:19:10,417
I can't believe I married a spy.
What am I? Pussy Galore?

1246
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:12,145
Not that I know of.

1247
01:19:12,877 --> 01:19:13,904
Excuse me?

1248
01:19:14,295 --> 01:19:16,289
You're going to complain now
about our sex life?

1249
01:19:16,299 --> 01:19:17,211
Is that what you're doing?

1250
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:18,528
- I'm not going to complain
- That's what you're going to do now?

1251
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:19,258
about our sex...

1252
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,327
Pull the car over!
We'll have sex right now!

1253
01:19:21,337 --> 01:19:23,521
No! We're going to my parents.
We are going to my parents!

1254
01:19:23,522 --> 01:19:25,050
- No. No!
- I'm taking us to my parents house.

1255
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,122
We're not going to your parents house.
- Yes! Yes...

1256
01:19:26,123 --> 01:19:26,813
Yes, we are.

1257
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,962
- We are...
- I said YES!

1258
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:28,610
Listen to me.

1259
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:32,356
We can not go to your parents,
you have to trust me.

1260
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:34,708
I love you!

1261
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,620
And I will protect you. Now you did

1262
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:41,261
a great job of finding a car. I need
you to point it at the house

1263
01:19:41,262 --> 01:19:42,404
and step on it.

1264
01:19:43,789 --> 01:19:44,979
Okay, fine.

1265
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:48,625
I'm stepping on it and it's not...

1266
01:19:49,521 --> 01:19:51,291
It's not going... it's...

1267
01:19:51,301 --> 01:19:52,881
stopping actually. It's starting to...

1268
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:55,169
...not go.

1269
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:17,323
Didn't notice the uhh...
blinking fuel light?

1270
01:20:18,283 --> 01:20:19,050
You're right.

1271
01:20:19,559 --> 01:20:22,978
I apologize. Topping off the tank
should have been my first priority.

1272
01:20:29,153 --> 01:20:30,814
Run... run!

1273
01:20:42,189 --> 01:20:42,589
Go!

1274
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:53,069
Darn it!

1275
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:00,750
- It's locked. Stop pulling it!
- Come on!

1276
01:21:03,112 --> 01:21:03,804
I missed...

1277
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:04,521
Really?

1278
01:21:05,981 --> 01:21:07,033
Run!

1279
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,895
20 Million!!! You got him sweetie.

1280
01:21:35,043 --> 01:21:36,702
God, those Volvo's are amazing.

1281
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:43,950
- Shit!
- The Block party.

1282
01:21:45,223 --> 01:21:46,428
Stay close. Keep moving.

1283
01:21:57,152 --> 01:21:58,228
Walnut muffin?

1284
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:24,780
Hi guys! Spence... Spence. Jen... Jen.

1285
01:22:24,944 --> 01:22:27,363
Jen... Jen...
where are you guys going?

1286
01:22:27,404 --> 01:22:29,205
They've got corn dogs.
They’ve got regular...

1287
01:22:29,225 --> 01:22:30,908
and they've got bacon covered.

1288
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,128
Hey honey!
There's no way she's packing heat.

1289
01:22:33,476 --> 01:22:35,423
You'd be surprised where
people hide stuff.

1290
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:38,652
Guys, can I use the bathroom
in your house?

1291
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:40,542
Number one.

1292
01:22:42,395 --> 01:22:43,521
- Where is the Go bag?
- In the office.

1293
01:22:44,755 --> 01:22:47,012
Stay away from the windows, okay.
The safe is

1294
01:22:47,013 --> 01:22:49,160
underneath the carpet and the
combination's our anniversary.

1295
01:22:49,885 --> 01:22:50,824
Where are you going?

1296
01:22:51,004 --> 01:22:51,860
To get the guns.

1297
01:22:52,614 --> 01:22:54,791
Oh, to get the guns. More guns.

1298
01:22:55,277 --> 01:22:55,836
That's great!

1299
01:23:23,395 --> 01:23:25,439
Rotilda Walfredsson?

1300
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:27,663
Ooh, I'm Swedish.

1301
01:23:34,273 --> 01:23:34,963
Spence?

1302
01:23:37,052 --> 01:23:38,420
Spencer, is that you?

1303
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,200
Spence?

1304
01:23:55,987 --> 01:23:57,120
Spencer, is that you?

1305
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:04,950
Oh God!

1306
01:24:05,619 --> 01:24:06,327
Mom.

1307
01:24:06,877 --> 01:24:09,270
Hey, you know...
it is actually not a great time.

1308
01:24:09,867 --> 01:24:10,414
You think?

1309
01:24:15,755 --> 01:24:16,888
Kristen?

1310
01:24:18,273 --> 01:24:19,856
You know...
that actually kind of makes sense.

1311
01:24:20,564 --> 01:24:23,088
Lower your gun
or it's last call for mommy.

1312
01:24:50,084 --> 01:24:51,601
I told you, she's not a nice girl.

1313
01:24:51,701 --> 01:24:52,440
You told her that?

1314
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,256
That's very rude.

1315
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,126
God damn it! Who is up there?

1316
01:25:00,226 --> 01:25:00,892
I don't know.

1317
01:25:00,992 --> 01:25:03,218
If somebody shoots Mr. Perfect
before I have the chance to...

1318
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:05,034
I will kill you both.

1319
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:08,952
On principal, lower your gun, now!

1320
01:25:17,217 --> 01:25:17,760
Check it out.

1321
01:25:33,317 --> 01:25:35,967
Just let my mom go, okay.
I am all the leverage you need.

1322
01:25:35,977 --> 01:25:40,169
I didn't spend the last three years
listening to you babble incisively

1323
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,278
about your perfect little life

1324
01:25:42,288 --> 01:25:43,858
<i>to F it all up now.</i>

1325
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:46,364
So get in the living room,
both of you.

1326
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:46,893
Let's go!

1327
01:25:47,821 --> 01:25:48,615
Let's go!

1328
01:25:50,259 --> 01:25:51,242
Let's go!

1329
01:25:52,336 --> 01:25:53,623
Turn around.

1330
01:25:53,723 --> 01:25:54,305
Come here, dear.

1331
01:25:54,405 --> 01:25:55,210
Come on.

1332
01:25:59,294 --> 01:25:59,802
You okay? Are you all right?

1333
01:25:59,803 --> 01:26:00,718
Jen...

1334
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:04,125
To be fair,
we did have some good times.

1335
01:26:04,561 --> 01:26:05,088
Yeah!

1336
01:26:05,464 --> 01:26:06,420
Remember when...

1337
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:11,470
Oh, there you are dear.

1338
01:26:15,878 --> 01:26:16,957
Answer the phone, sir.

1339
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:21,469
My dead best friend wants to let you
know that your target's still alive.

1340
01:26:22,431 --> 01:26:24,011
Stand down, Spencer.

1341
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:25,401
Whoa, hey... guys.

1342
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:27,253
He killed Holbrook.

1343
01:26:28,086 --> 01:26:29,553
Two to the heart, one to the head.
Remember?

1344
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:35,860
And then he pulled the trigger on me.

1345
01:26:38,288 --> 01:26:39,451
Daddy, is that true?

1346
01:26:39,551 --> 01:26:42,886
I put sleepers in your life
because I didn't trust your husband.

1347
01:26:44,578 --> 01:26:46,008
I hoped I'd never have to use it.

1348
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:50,177
It's the flash drive from
Holbrooks watch.

1349
01:26:50,188 --> 01:26:53,108
It's all there,
his old boss turned dirty.

1350
01:26:53,962 --> 01:26:56,937
And in you office... when I saw that
card with his name on it,

1351
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:00,251
I knew you were back in the game
and you were coming after me.

1352
01:27:04,661 --> 01:27:06,166
So I activated the killers.

1353
01:27:06,436 --> 01:27:08,919
I'm not trying to kill you, sir.

1354
01:27:08,959 --> 01:27:11,305
Why don't you tell her about Nice,
where you tried to blow me up.

1355
01:27:11,787 --> 01:27:12,987
How did you know about Nice?

1356
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:15,070
I was supposed to be on
that helicopter.

1357
01:27:15,989 --> 01:27:17,524
When I saw you, I didn't go.

1358
01:27:21,205 --> 01:27:24,462
You said you got out
when we met in France,

1359
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:26,144
you said you were in the love bubble.

1360
01:27:26,154 --> 01:27:26,775
I got out.

1361
01:27:26,785 --> 01:27:27,480
I'm out!

1362
01:27:27,704 --> 01:27:30,420
Just look at him,
does he look like he's out?

1363
01:27:30,425 --> 01:27:31,289
It was my last job.

1364
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:34,281
I'm out! I got out...

1365
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:36,939
for us.

1366
01:27:39,753 --> 01:27:41,052
And I'm never going back.

1367
01:27:56,234 --> 01:27:57,229
So...

1368
01:27:57,426 --> 01:27:58,863
You are not a pilot.

1369
01:28:02,547 --> 01:28:04,914
Daddy enough, put your gun down.
I have been dodging

1370
01:28:04,924 --> 01:28:07,446
bullets all day thanks to you
and it is not good for the baby.

1371
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:08,731
You have a baby?

1372
01:28:08,732 --> 01:28:09,643
No, I'm going to.

1373
01:28:10,029 --> 01:28:10,848
Ohh!! I knew it.

1374
01:28:11,957 --> 01:28:12,733
- Let's celebrate.
- Okay!

1375
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:14,195
I'm going to be a Grandpa?

1376
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:15,127
Yes.

1377
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:20,341
Oh God!

1378
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,097
Oh my God.

1379
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:27,416
And you are the father?

1380
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:28,900
Oh for God's sakes, dad.

1381
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:39,223
Okay.

1382
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:40,210
Okay.

1383
01:28:40,722 --> 01:28:41,222
Okay.

1384
01:28:41,223 --> 01:28:43,347
This would be a great time
for a trust circle.

1385
01:28:43,515 --> 01:28:44,359
A trust circle?

1386
01:28:44,369 --> 01:28:44,907
Yes.

1387
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:46,308
Yeah!

1388
01:28:48,373 --> 01:28:49,260
Yeah! Let's do that, okay.

1389
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:51,298
Let's gather everybody.
Dad, pull up a chair.

1390
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,267
Mother, join us.

1391
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:53,680
O... kay.

1392
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:55,867
Okay.

1393
01:28:56,336 --> 01:28:57,588
I don't do trust circles.

1394
01:28:57,688 --> 01:29:00,777
I know mother, but I think that this
is necessary. Humour me.

1395
01:29:01,448 --> 01:29:01,930
Okay.

1396
01:29:02,405 --> 01:29:03,620
I finally understand

1397
01:29:04,067 --> 01:29:07,632
that I am not to blame for
this dynamic, okay?

1398
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:08,974
You are!

1399
01:29:09,581 --> 01:29:13,614
And you need to own that.
I need to own the fact that

1400
01:29:13,615 --> 01:29:17,975
I unwittingly married the one man
who is exactly like my father.

1401
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,149
A liar.

1402
01:29:21,075 --> 01:29:21,775
So...

1403
01:29:22,184 --> 01:29:26,901
If any of you want to ever see this
kid. This is what's going to happen.

1404
01:29:27,383 --> 01:29:27,882
Okay.

1405
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:30,733
There will be no more lying.

1406
01:29:31,227 --> 01:29:33,744
No more... stealing cars or...

1407
01:29:33,923 --> 01:29:35,131
hiding weapons in the furniture.

1408
01:29:35,151 --> 01:29:37,891
And I never want to see you two
try to kill each other again.

1409
01:29:37,991 --> 01:29:38,510
Okay, in fact...

1410
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:40,062
There will be no more killing.

1411
01:29:40,456 --> 01:29:42,770
I don't want to see you swat
a fucking fly!

1412
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:43,392
Okay?

1413
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,138
All right.

1414
01:29:44,414 --> 01:29:45,338
Are we all together on this?

1415
01:29:45,818 --> 01:29:46,879
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

1416
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:47,818
Great job baby.

1417
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,761
Is there anything else

1418
01:29:53,122 --> 01:29:55,053
that I need to or should know?

1419
01:29:56,804 --> 01:29:57,241
Anyone?

1420
01:29:58,764 --> 01:29:59,578
Spencer?

1421
01:30:01,586 --> 01:30:03,805
English is not my first language.

1422
01:30:14,535 --> 01:30:19,755
Oh. Oh. And also...
The third week that we were together,

1423
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,463
you said I love you...

1424
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:27,596
in your sleep. And I didn't tell you

1425
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,490
because I wanted to be the one
who said it first.

1426
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,066
So...

1427
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:37,268
Thank you honey.

1428
01:30:38,822 --> 01:30:39,657
Mom?

1429
01:30:44,385 --> 01:30:46,005
Dear, you remember that time that,

1430
01:30:46,603 --> 01:30:48,745
I took you and your little friend
for a boat ride?

1431
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:50,339
No.

1432
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:51,285
No?

1433
01:30:52,151 --> 01:30:53,662
Well, forget it then. We're good.

1434
01:30:56,491 --> 01:30:56,891
Okay.

1435
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:01,098
Okay... fine.

1436
01:31:01,099 --> 01:31:03,295
In addition to planting
killers in your life

1437
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,506
and secretly working for
a government agency,

1438
01:31:05,947 --> 01:31:07,187
I would like to admit...

1439
01:31:09,190 --> 01:31:09,974
Yoo hoo!

1440
01:31:11,974 --> 01:31:13,046
Yoo hoo!

1441
01:31:15,848 --> 01:31:17,012
Jen!

1442
01:31:18,245 --> 01:31:21,344
We need to talk about that
darn property line.

1443
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:25,484
Hi, Jen...

1444
01:31:30,732 --> 01:31:31,350
Sweetie?

1445
01:31:31,551 --> 01:31:32,906
I don't think she was a killer.

1446
01:31:33,748 --> 01:31:34,682
Oh, I know.

1447
01:31:41,907 --> 01:31:44,008
Red wire crosses blue, good as new.

1448
01:31:44,716 --> 01:31:47,592
Blue crosses red, good as dead,
I know. It's my saying.

1449
01:31:47,692 --> 01:31:50,288
That's not your saying, that's my
saying. You copied me.

1450
01:31:50,388 --> 01:31:53,110
I did not copy...
I've not copied you a day in my life.

1451
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:55,161
Really?

1452
01:31:55,829 --> 01:31:57,253
I think it's coming in nice,
don't you?

1453
01:31:57,271 --> 01:31:57,971
No.

1454
01:32:00,283 --> 01:32:01,290
Well, he likes it.

1455
01:32:01,533 --> 01:32:02,559
Don't you, buddy?

1456
01:32:03,064 --> 01:32:07,158
You like daddy's mustache don't you?
Don't you like that mustache?

1457
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:08,793
How's my little big guy doing?

1458
01:32:08,893 --> 01:32:12,026
Great. Except for your dad thinks
I'm copying him which I'm not.

1459
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:13,492
Will you please tell him
I'm not copying him.

1460
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:16,206
Sorry sweetie.
Every girl marries her father.

1461
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:17,826
Oh, that's not gross.

1462
01:32:17,926 --> 01:32:18,957
I certainly did.

1463
01:32:19,027 --> 01:32:20,999
Oh my father was one handsome man.

1464
01:32:21,467 --> 01:32:23,449
Well built... rippling muscles.

1465
01:32:23,549 --> 01:32:25,787
His mustache was a lot
larger than yours though.

1466
01:32:26,135 --> 01:32:29,213
- Thick! Like a Vulcan forest.
- Well, that's nice mother

1467
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:31,323
but you're here to baby-sit,
not creep me out.

1468
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:32,163
So if you wouldn't mind...

1469
01:32:32,263 --> 01:32:33,616
Oh... hi!

1470
01:32:35,762 --> 01:32:37,546
Yeah, Grandma's a little scary.

1471
01:32:40,093 --> 01:32:43,110
You know, maybe it's too soon.
Maybe we should just stay.

1472
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:46,061
No, no. It's not too soon.
We're not staying. It's date night.

1473
01:32:46,161 --> 01:32:48,304
We're going to go out. It's going to
be great. I'm wearing my skinny jeans.

1474
01:32:48,404 --> 01:32:50,666
Don't worry Spencer. You can trust us.

1475
01:32:55,449 --> 01:32:57,574
Well, if we can't trust them,
who can we trust, right?

1476
01:32:57,575 --> 01:32:58,517
Right!

1477
01:32:59,478 --> 01:33:00,398
Bye, buddy!
