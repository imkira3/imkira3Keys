2
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,643
Now I am the richest person
in the world.

3
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:03,544
I am the richest person in the world.

4
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:09,042
Now I am the richest person
in the world.

5
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:13,448
I am the richest person
in the world. I am...

6
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:18,928
Mi capitán, not another ship in sight.

7
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,867
Yes, King Carlos should be very pleased.

8
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,834
Tell me, who is more important
to please...

9
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:29,463
the King of Spain or God?

10
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:32,144
Well, God, of course.

11
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:35,805
And who is God's personal representative
in this vicinity?

12
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:39,311
Well, you are, Your Blessed Rectitude.

13
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:42,052
Well, God wants to keep all of it.

14
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:44,511
But...

15
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:48,694
And anybody who dares "buts"
God's personal representative...

16
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,830
will soon find his head pierced
and his neck stretched...

17
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,956
and will go on to meet God very quickly!

18
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:58,138
Which is more than anybody
could reasonably hope for...

19
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,205
Your Holy Ruthlessness.

20
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,903
Instead, you may bang your head
on the floor until forgiven.

21
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,054
Congratulations, Captain Yellowbeard.

22
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:32,432
- I'm glad my plan was a success.
- Your plan, my gold.

23
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:36,202
Hands off my treasure, Bosun Moon!

24
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:39,432
I said hands off!

25
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,334
Do I have to do everything myself?

26
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,776
Come now, don't slow down.

27
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,845
- Step over him.
- Move it.

28
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:50,176
- Step out of the way.
- We've got another one here now.

29
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:53,218
Over here.

30
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:55,620
Bloody hell, another one.
Bloody witches.

31
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,019
Corpses, corpses, all day long.
Never stops.

32
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:04,053
You know, Gilbert, being a prisoner's
not what it was when I came in here.

33
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,294
Here we go.

34
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:10,202
Whimpering poncies.
They get a leg broken and they faint.

35
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:13,205
A few fingernails pulled out,
they start crying.

36
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:15,207
When they stretched me on a rack
for a couple of years...

37
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:18,140
I didn't go around dying
all over the place.

38
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:24,316
Pathetic. Taking the easy way out
like that.

39
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,752
How do you mean exactly?

40
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:28,755
Dying. He'd only been in 15 years.

41
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:33,052
You won't catch me dying.
They'll have to kill me before I die.

42
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:36,526
Many a man has tried,
Captain Yellowbeard.

43
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:39,832
And soon you will be at large again.

44
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:42,568
With a hand-picked crew
of the hardest buccaneers...

45
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:45,505
that have ever stained
the seven seas with Spanish blood.

46
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:49,165
It was most unjust I thought,
locking you up for...

47
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,278
merely doing your duty.

48
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:54,915
Twenty years for killing 5,000 dagos
and frogs.

49
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:58,382
Betrayed by me right-hand man,
that bastard Moon.

50
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:01,288
But he never found out
where you hid the treasure, did he?

51
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,357
No! Nor will he ever.

52
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,449
Where did you hide
the treasure, actually?

53
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,826
You won't catch me
with those trick questions.

54
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:14,667
What really pisses me off, is...

55
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,796
- What is it now?
- You've got a visitor.

56
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:20,873
I expect that'll be the Queen
with my pardon.

57
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,317
- Hello, sugar drawers.
- What, you again?

58
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,861
Again? I haven't seen you for 15 years.

59
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,691
What is it this time?

60
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:46,731
Well, what with you being let out
next week...

61
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:51,904
I thought it was my duty as a wife
to bring you up to date on a few things.

62
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:56,012
Now, do you remember just before
you were arrested we were having a cuddle?

63
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:59,604
- I was raping you, if that's what you mean.
- All right.

64
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:03,882
- Sort of half cuddle, half rape.
- Get on with it, woman!

65
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:09,025
Well, I haven't told you this before,
because I wanted him to be brought up...

66
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,456
like a gentleman and not a pirate.

67
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,623
Who are you talking about?

68
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:17,934
- The fruit of your loins, sugar drawers.
- Are you mad, woman?

69
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:21,471
I haven't got fruit in my loins.
Lice, yes, and proud of them!

70
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:24,904
It means that we have spawned a son.

71
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:26,168
Done what?

72
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:28,804
You have just become the father...

73
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:32,813
of a 20-year-old
bouncing boy called Dan.

74
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,713
A son. Takes after me, does he?

75
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:38,477
Well...

76
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:42,251
By the time I was 20,
I'd killed 500 men.

77
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:45,918
Well, he's not quite so extroverted
as you, but he's...

78
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,932
- A thief?
- No.

79
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:50,334
- A rapist?
- No.

80
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:53,904
- Bloody hell. I give up. What is he then?
- He's a gardener.

81
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:58,941
A gardener? A Yellowbeard gardening?
I'll see about that when I'm out.

82
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:02,974
- What is it now?
- Time's up, sir.

83
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,645
So your son's a gardener, eh?

84
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:20,064
- There you are, Mr. Pew.
- I said a double.

85
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:24,761
- Did you?
- I know a double when I hears one. When!

86
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,108
Dan's coming.

87
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:35,608
Reading as usual.

88
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:43,713
There you are, Dan.

89
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:49,624
- Got a moment?
- I'm reading something.

90
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,194
Read, read.

91
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,623
Read, read, read.

92
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,134
There's more important things in life
than reading, Son.

93
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:00,873
Keep an ear on the bar,
would you, Mr. Pew?

94
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:01,997
Right.

95
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:04,478
If there's one thing
I've learned in life...

96
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:07,114
it's that learning things
never taught me nothing.

97
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:10,047
- And books is the worst.
- All right, Mother.

98
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:14,450
Last time I read a book, I was raped.

99
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:19,246
- So let that be a lesson to you.
- What do you want?

100
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,093
Well, it's about your father.

101
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,061
What about him?

102
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,324
Well, when I said he was dead...

103
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:32,736
- I was only trying to cushion the blow.
- What blow?

104
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:34,535
He's alive.

105
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,038
He's alive and imprisoned as a pirate.

106
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:41,079
A pirate?

107
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:46,486
- Like Yellowbeard?
- Very much like Yellowbeard, yes.

108
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,713
In fact, he is Yellowbeard.

109
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:04,095
No, thank you, sir.

110
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:16,781
Commander Clement, Royal Navy.

111
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,459
Welcome, Commander Clement.

112
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:37,005
Her Majesty's temporary throne room...

113
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:41,236
- is in the huge withdrawing room.
- Thank you, Lady Lambourn.

114
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:51,712
Lambourn, stop that man
pissing on the hedge.

115
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,850
It's imported!

116
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:58,461
You, come here! You, stop that at once!

117
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,189
That comes special,
all the way from Egypt!

118
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:17,938
Next...

119
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:22,118
the head of Her Majesty's
Secret Service.

120
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,619
Not to be read out loud.

121
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,484
Excuse me. Joking apart.

122
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,160
Royal Navy Commander Clement.

123
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,914
The fat one on the throne is the Queen.

124
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:04,559
She's not very well today,
so I should kneel upwind of her.

125
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:09,560
And the thin one is Lady Churchill.
She's the brains of the outfit.

126
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:20,646
- State your business.
- Your Majesty, we in the Naval Department...

127
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:24,851
while being keenly aware of recent spirals
in Defense expenditure...

128
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,818
- humbly submit...
- Are you the Prime Minister?

129
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,024
Secret Service.

130
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:35,385
Charades!

131
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:41,164
- You're a beekeeper.
- That'll do for her.

132
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:44,226
- Will it?
- What do you want?

133
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:48,274
The pirate Yellowbeard
is due to be released in two days...

134
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:51,477
and despite years of unpleasantness,
he's still told us nothing...

135
00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:53,180
of the treasure he's hidden.

136
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,149
However, I have a detailed plan here.

137
00:14:56,249 --> 00:15:00,185
I doubt if she could manage
more than the label on a gin bottle.

138
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:01,854
Just tell us.

139
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,327
Well, milady, we'd like you to increase
his sentence, so he's bound to escape...

140
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:10,931
and make straight for the treasure.
I shall need a fast ship to follow him.

141
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:15,093
A sensible request,
I think, Your Majesty.

142
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:22,308
The beekeeper would like this signed.

143
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:24,071
Certainly.

144
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,583
- Come on, move it, you ratbag!
- Get in there!

145
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:37,859
- Mr. Yellowbeard.
- Captain to you, you scum.

146
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:42,124
Quite. Sorry, "Captain" Yellowbeard.

147
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:48,003
Yes. Twenty years ago today,
you were sentenced to jail.

148
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:50,572
Yes, and now I'm due to be released.

149
00:15:50,672 --> 00:15:52,936
Yes. Or rather no.

150
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:55,243
You see, 20 years ago...

151
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:59,178
no one was expected
to live in jail for 20 years.

152
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:03,579
Filthy, horrendous conditions
that existed then, and, indeed...

153
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:05,722
still exist today.

154
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:09,485
So the judge who sentenced you
had no idea you would survive.

155
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:12,795
Therefore, Her Majesty
has graciously agreed...

156
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:16,626
to increase your sentence
a further 140 years. Case dismissed.

157
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:18,799
I've got him!

158
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:20,793
Sorry.

159
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:29,734
- Get off of me!
- What are you doing?

160
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:31,673
Stop him! Stop him!

161
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,544
Get over there where you belong!

162
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:42,213
- Went well with the Commander then, did it?
- No.

163
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,263
So I can take it you won't be leaving us
just yet, as it were.

164
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:49,730
They broke their solemn word.

165
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:52,831
There's governments for you.

166
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,206
I expect they wanted to know
about the treasure.

167
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,208
Yes, and that's something
they'll never know.

168
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,540
Well, until you tell them
about the treasure...

169
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:07,018
the only way you're gonna get
out of here is feet first.

170
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:11,111
- Open the gate!
- Must be an awful strain...

171
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:14,384
being the only man in the world
knowing where it's hidden.

172
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:18,954
Why don't you share the burden
with a friend?

173
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:23,728
Gilbert.

174
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:26,365
Mr. Moon?

175
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:31,334
- Is that you?
- Get a move on, Gilbert.

176
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,979
Coming, Captain. Here I come.

177
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:58,732
Move, you scum.

178
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:10,315
- Yellowbeard.
- Who was that stink?

179
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,997
I do wish it didn't have to be
such a rush every time.

180
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,122
What?

181
00:18:28,702 --> 00:18:31,171
I haven't got time for that now!

182
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:34,975
Well, it's been 20 years
since we had a little cuddle...

183
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:39,179
and what do you do?
Come in here and give me a kiss?

184
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,650
No. You rush in
and hack a hole in the wall.

185
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,015
- Where's the map?
- What map?

186
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:50,924
If you say you don't know where it is...

187
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:54,256
I'll nail your tits to the table!

188
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:58,230
Oh, dear!

189
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,462
I know where it is.

190
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:02,402
It's burnt.

191
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:04,939
You burnt my map?

192
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,210
- But only after I copied it.
- Where's the copy?

193
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,144
- When little Dan came along...
- Who's Dan?

194
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:16,779
My and probably your son!

195
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:20,521
When little Dan was two minutes old...

196
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,150
I tattooed it on his head.

197
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:27,228
- Does he know about this?
- No. Nor nobody else, neither.

198
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:30,594
That's why I kept him
in the cupboard for three years.

199
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,769
That may be why he's a bit odd...

200
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:37,202
with all these books and reading
and stuff like that.

201
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:40,604
- Where is he now?
- Lambourn Hall.

202
00:19:40,976 --> 00:19:43,746
Right. I'll go up there
and cut his head off.

203
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:46,371
Where's my pirating outfit?

204
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:51,044
Royal Navy here.

205
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,727
Where's Yellowbeard?

206
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:00,295
Yellowbeard!

207
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:05,167
Where is Yellowbeard?

208
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,134
He's...

209
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:09,727
He's...

210
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:12,534
He's...

211
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:15,133
He's...

212
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:16,934
He's...

213
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,573
- gone!
- Gone!

214
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:24,121
Well...

215
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:27,417
if he's gone, you must have seen him.

216
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:29,826
No.

217
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,792
Who's the pretty boy?

218
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:39,897
Shut up!

219
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,278
And what's this?

220
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:54,118
That's Lord Lambourn's waistcoat.
He's such a kind man.

221
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:58,122
He thinks of everybody.
He left those here in case you escaped...

222
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:02,628
- and needed a change of clothing.
- I'm sure I killed the last one I raped.

223
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,389
It can't have been you.

224
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,367
The after-play was a bit
on the rough side...

225
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,458
but not fatal, dear.

226
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,040
What's this Dan, or whatever
you call him, look like?

227
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,973
He looks a little bit
like Lord Lambourn, actually.

228
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:21,737
But a bit more like you.
Much more like you, in fact.

229
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:28,686
Yellowbeard. A tall, rough man
with a big yellow beard.

230
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:46,769
That's our agent, sir.

231
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:50,999
Did you see...

232
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:57,518
- He's blind, you stupid sod!
- I may be blind...

233
00:21:57,618 --> 00:21:59,953
but I have acute hearing.

234
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:03,023
I'm not interested in your jewelry,
cloth eyes. I'm trying to conduct...

235
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:04,556
Yellowbeard...

236
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,895
- was here.
- How do you know it was him?

237
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,724
Because he sounded...

238
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:11,988
about 47...

239
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:17,471
and his clothing gave off
the unmistakable fibrous crackling sound...

240
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:19,707
- of the 80% hessian...
- Which way did he go?

241
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,877
...whilst the deafening
rustling of his beard...

242
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:27,346
- indicated a length of not...
- Which way did he go?

243
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,953
- Upstairs.
- Come on!

244
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:47,302
- Where's Yellowbeard?
- He's in prison, isn't he?

245
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:50,839
Your husband escaped this evening.
We know he came straight here.

246
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:55,043
Come to think of it,
somebody did come in here a while back...

247
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:59,045
- but I don't think it was my husband.
- These are his clothes.

248
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:03,886
Wait a minute.
Somebody did pop in and rape me.

249
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:07,251
- These must be his clothes.
- That's Yellowbeard, all right.

250
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,359
Prison has reformed him.

251
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:13,696
He never bothered to take his clothes off
in the old days.

252
00:23:13,796 --> 00:23:16,832
- Where did he go?
- I've no idea.

253
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:20,060
Right, Mansell. Bring those clothes.
We'll need a scent.

254
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:23,032
- For the dogs.
- Right.

255
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:38,484
Yellowbeard?

256
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:47,464
- Evening, Gilbert.
- Now look here, Pew.

257
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:50,700
- I'm all ears.
- Those two gentlemen that just left...

258
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,003
you didn't tell them everything
you heard, did you, shipmate?

259
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:54,337
What gentlemen?

260
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:56,474
I didn't hear you mention
much about a map.

261
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:59,338
- What map?
- Yellowbeard's map.

262
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:04,348
The one that any pirate worth his parrot
would give both his wooden legs for.

263
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:07,618
You're drunk, Gilbert.
Your mind's wandering.

264
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:10,588
My hands will be wandering
towards your throat, Pew...

265
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:13,090
if you don't tell me
what it is you overheard.

266
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,093
So you can pass the information
on to Mr. Moon...

267
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:20,332
so he can find the treasure?
Over my dead body.

268
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:22,831
Very well, if those are your conditions.

269
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,764
I was hoping we might
see this eye to eye.

270
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:31,133
I'm afraid you've forced my hand.

271
00:24:31,877 --> 00:24:34,679
Listen up, my hearties! Listen.

272
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:38,113
This dear old blind man here...

273
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:43,755
is a government agent! It is true.
I saw him talking to those two.

274
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:45,015
It is a lie!

275
00:24:47,926 --> 00:24:50,020
I only told him one thing...

276
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:53,123
about a treasure!

277
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:55,868
- Treasure?
- Bolt that door.

278
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:58,504
- Bolt that door, lads.
- Draw them curtains.

279
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:01,107
- Draw them curtains!
- Put them other lights out.

280
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:03,471
Put them other lights out, lads!

281
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:20,889
- Where's Yellowbeard?
- Mr. Moon, sir.

282
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:24,894
I was following him,
and then I thought I was being followed...

283
00:25:25,064 --> 00:25:27,835
- if you follow me.
- Who'd follow you?

284
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:30,062
Some stupid blind man.

285
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:34,173
Well, we've got to follow Yellowbeard,
and make sure no one else is following him.

286
00:25:34,273 --> 00:25:35,639
Do you follow me?

287
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:39,411
What's going on in there?

288
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:01,262
Evening. Sounded as though
there was a bit of a squabble.

289
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:03,165
Squabble?

290
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:05,606
- They're all dead.
- All?

291
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,339
Must have been more of a tiff then.

292
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:12,175
Squabble, tiff.

293
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:17,409
Mr. Moon!

294
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,601
I imagine being in the Navy, you must know
quite a lot about the sea and what's in it.

295
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:34,570
- A trifle.
- A trifle?

296
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,799
Yes, I once had a rum trifle,
but I only drink when I'm working.

297
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:40,943
- Indeed.
- There you are, Lambourn.

298
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:44,580
I was wanting your advice
on a matter of etiquetty.

299
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,706
Now, does one curtsey
before saying adieu...

300
00:26:47,817 --> 00:26:51,454
or does one go down while speaking?

301
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:53,818
Oh, dear. That's tricky.

302
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:59,319
Excuse me, Admiral. I must just have
a word with this gentleman.

303
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:03,133
I shan't be a moment. Oh, I say.

304
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:06,929
Who was that chap who just seized hold
of my wife? Do you know him?

305
00:27:07,536 --> 00:27:09,095
Steady. Steady.

306
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:14,177
He seems to have taken
quite a shine to Lady L.

307
00:27:15,078 --> 00:27:16,409
Yes.

308
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,944
Not many people do, you know.
But when they do, they do.

309
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,180
And when she does, she does.

310
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,895
- Is your name Dan?
- Yes.

311
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:35,033
- I need your head, my lad.
- You're my father.

312
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,168
So your mother says,
but that's no reason to believe it.

313
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:40,171
- Never trust a woman or a government.
- Well, pleased to meet you.

314
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:43,274
I haven't got time for idle chitchat!
I need your head.

315
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:44,742
Well, that makes a change.

316
00:27:44,842 --> 00:27:47,245
Mother seems to disapprove
of me using it at all.

317
00:27:47,345 --> 00:27:49,681
You're not gonna use it.
You're gonna lose it, lad.

318
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:52,550
I'm gonna use it.
Right. Put your neck over there.

319
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,814
- It'll be cleaner that way.
- You want to cut my head off?

320
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:58,157
- What for?
- I don't want to lug your body...

321
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:02,386
halfway around the world, do I?
Your head's got a map on it that I need.

322
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:06,699
Well, you don't need to kill me for it.
Look, why don't you copy it?

323
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,996
What? And have two maps? Bugger off!

324
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:14,206
Look, if you cut my head off,
it'll start to putrefy.

325
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:17,376
- Do what?
- Putrefy! Go rotten!

326
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:20,579
Yeah, it would ooze a lot. Heads do.
But I can live with that.

327
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,816
No, stop! Look! I could help you, Dad.

328
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:24,884
Everyone will be following you...

329
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:27,219
- and if they catch you, they'll have the map.
- Bugger them!

330
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,190
I'll eat it first.
Won't be the first head I've eaten.

331
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,725
But then you'll have lost it forever.

332
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:34,160
Look. Wouldn't it be better
to leave it where it's safe?

333
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,761
What? And take you along?

334
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:38,729
You're not pirate material!
You wouldn't fit in.

335
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:43,333
Hello, Dan. Been doing some gardening?

336
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:46,706
- I don't believe we've been introduced.
- All right, Dan.

337
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:49,909
If you're my son, prove it.
Kill this stupid old bugger.

338
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:52,946
- Now hold your horses.
- I can't kill him. He brought me up...

339
00:28:53,046 --> 00:28:54,281
just like a father.

340
00:28:54,381 --> 00:28:57,517
You mean he's beaten you and kicked you
and smashed you in the teeth?

341
00:28:57,617 --> 00:28:58,585
- Yes.
- No!

342
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:01,288
- No.
- He's been kind and gentle.

343
00:29:01,388 --> 00:29:04,558
- What kind of father is that? Kill him!
- No!

344
00:29:04,658 --> 00:29:07,762
- All right. I'll do it.
- No, don't!

345
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:09,529
Look, he could be useful.

346
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:13,726
Yes, I could be useful. I could, I could,
I could. What could I do?

347
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:18,606
- They followed you here.
- I'll kill them all!

348
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:20,775
- No, quick hide in here.
- All right.

349
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:24,334
But I'll kill anyone that gets in the way
of me killing anyone.

350
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:27,414
We'll take him to Dr. Gilpin's.
He always knows what to do.

351
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:30,483
- And then kill everybody!
- Whatever you like, Dad.

352
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:34,589
Dad? Him?
You mean to say I'm not your father?

353
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,292
No. Mother says he is,
but you're still my father to me.

354
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:42,364
- I'm still my father to you, Son.
- Look, you brought me up.

355
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:44,599
You're my father. I don't even know him.

356
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,792
- Lambourn!
- I'll come with you, Son.

357
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,999
- This Dr. Gilpin, is he your father?
- No, he's your closest friend.

358
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:54,041
I look forward to meeting him.

359
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:57,643
Twenty-three, twenty-four,
twenty-five...

360
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:08,348
Lady Lambourn.

361
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,457
- Well, he's not even married to her.
- I think he's blind.

362
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,028
Under her command, so to speak.

363
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:22,062
Now, see here, if you go with him,
you'll be criminals.

364
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,229
You'll never be able
to return to England.

365
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:29,502
But if the government
gets the treasure...

366
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:34,109
they'll only waste it.
Warmongering in Europe.

367
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:39,118
There we are.

368
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,488
- That looks nothing like me!
- Well, that's the whole idea.

369
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:50,367
I've got to go with him, my father,
to get the treasure.

370
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,570
- I've got the map of the island.
- Could be very dangerous.

371
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,273
It'll be dangerous. Do the boy good...

372
00:30:55,373 --> 00:30:58,170
to get a bit of senseless violence
into his life.

373
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:00,244
Will you come with us, too, Doctor?

374
00:31:00,344 --> 00:31:03,648
Why, think of all the new plants
and medicines you could discover.

375
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:05,147
Yeah. What's this?

376
00:31:06,016 --> 00:31:09,747
Stop! That's a precious extract
from a rare tropical tree.

377
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:12,548
One drop of it paralyzes
a man instantly.

378
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:20,420
Perhaps it wears off instantly.

379
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:22,630
No. No.

380
00:31:23,468 --> 00:31:26,529
Possibly ineffective
when taken through the mouth.

381
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:29,908
Well, of course, if we really were...

382
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:32,978
going on a botanical expedition...

383
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:34,445
- They're here.
- Kill!

384
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:36,782
- There's no need to.
- We must find a name for you.

385
00:31:36,882 --> 00:31:39,718
- Professor...
- Professor Flask.

386
00:31:39,818 --> 00:31:41,453
- Professor Death!
- Professor Chair.

387
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:43,155
- Professor Rape!
- Professor Clock.

388
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:45,224
What about Professor Anthrax?

389
00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:47,451
- Yes.
- Anthrax.

390
00:31:48,694 --> 00:31:51,185
Bugger off, you evil git!

391
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:55,763
Evening, Doctor.
I was just saying good day to Mr. Pew.

392
00:31:56,336 --> 00:31:59,668
Lord Lambourn. And Dan.

393
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,299
- And?
- Yeah, this is Professor Anthrax.

394
00:32:04,611 --> 00:32:08,706
- That's Yellowbeard.
- I'm in disguise, you stupid tart!

395
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,880
- You've met your father then.
- Yes.

396
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,920
We've got some exciting news.

397
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:19,721
- You're all going after the treasure!
- Treasure? No.

398
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:21,995
- No.
- Botanical...

399
00:32:22,095 --> 00:32:23,654
Killing plants!

400
00:32:24,564 --> 00:32:26,099
- Chasing butterflies.
- No.

401
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:28,429
Well, I'm entitled to my share.

402
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:32,772
What with all the lying and cheating
and tattooing that I've done over the years.

403
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:37,333
- Don't worry, Mother. You'll get your share.
- I don't ask for much.

404
00:32:38,412 --> 00:32:42,212
I'd just like to see
a few of my little dreams come true.

405
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,721
I've always wanted to buy Denmark
and be richer than the Queen.

406
00:32:47,821 --> 00:32:51,025
Yes, and if you do your job
covering up for us, Mother...

407
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,491
- that will all come true.
- And by the way...

408
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:56,962
why did you tell me
that I was his father?

409
00:32:57,465 --> 00:32:58,796
I didn't.

410
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:02,727
You were so sure he was,
I didn't have the heart to tell you.

411
00:33:02,938 --> 00:33:04,673
I think...

412
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:07,241
we'd better sail for Jamaica at once.

413
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:09,104
We'll find a ship...

414
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:11,568
at Portsmouth.

415
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:27,362
I was only taking what's my due
to cover expenses.

416
00:33:27,462 --> 00:33:29,930
You should see the mess they made.

417
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:32,329
- What happened?
- Plague.

418
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:34,704
Plague?

419
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,205
All sudden like.

420
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:39,069
Lucky I was out.

421
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:43,076
- That man's got a sword in him.
- He fell on it.

422
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:47,804
- Has Yellowbeard been here?
- He's dead, too.

423
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,279
And Lord Lambourn and Dr. Gilpin.

424
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:53,489
And my son.

425
00:33:53,589 --> 00:33:55,853
My son, Dan!

426
00:33:56,292 --> 00:33:59,227
All gone, all dead.

427
00:33:59,762 --> 00:34:02,765
- Oh, my!
- Oh, hell.

428
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:04,967
If they're all dead,
what are you gonna tell the Queen, sir?

429
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:08,093
I mean, we're supposed
to follow them to the treasure.

430
00:34:15,077 --> 00:34:19,344
- Halt! In the name of the law!
- All right! I'm not deaf!

431
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:25,587
All right, Pew, what have you heard?

432
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:35,733
Little did Yellowbeard surmise...

433
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:39,970
as he presented himself
to his prospective traveling companions...

434
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,775
that the details of the engagements
were being overheard...

435
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,611
by a tall blind man
of impressive bearing...

436
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,713
- aquiline features...
- Cut the purple prose, Pew.

437
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:52,146
Just give us the facts.
Where's Yellowbeard gone?

438
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:59,124
- Portsmouth.
- With whom?

439
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,885
Three people.

440
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,126
Lambourn.

441
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,124
Dan.

442
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:10,861
Dr. Gilpin.

443
00:35:11,636 --> 00:35:14,435
Right, Mansell.
We shall be needing that frigate.

444
00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:21,277
Come on, Mansell.
We'll be needing Mrs. Beard.

445
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:25,482
I think a month or two at sea
will loosen Mrs. Beard's tongue.

446
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:27,782
Is she going away, too, sir?

447
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,976
That'll do him.

448
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:06,353
How's that for a squabble, Pew?

449
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:17,065
Here! Stop! Thief!

450
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:23,034
Fresh flowers!

451
00:36:23,944 --> 00:36:25,673
Get your lucky heather!

452
00:36:26,947 --> 00:36:28,915
Yoo-hoo, fresh flowers, sir?

453
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:32,608
Yes.

454
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:39,316
Fresh heather! Fresh flowers!

455
00:36:47,803 --> 00:36:51,472
I've always been fascinated by the sea.
It's so big.

456
00:36:51,572 --> 00:36:53,403
It has the little...

457
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:19,895
It's the mouth
of the river port, isn't it?

458
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,912
Oh, my God!

459
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:40,312
Come on.

460
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:48,698
Harden your knives here.
Sharpen your knives.

461
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:51,134
Can I have three farthings
for a lump of shit, please?

462
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:52,202
I beg your pardon?

463
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:54,772
I said can I have three farthings
for a lump of shit?

464
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,099
No.

465
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,869
Society's to blame.

466
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:05,574
Harden your knives here.
Sharpen your knives.

467
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,412
Excuse me a moment.

468
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:12,782
Look out! Press gang!
Get out! Press gang.

469
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:16,523
- Get him. Come on.
- Catch him over there.

470
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,191
Come on, get him!

471
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,566
- That's the stuff.
- Press gang?

472
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,500
Yes, they persuade drunks and vagrants
to become sailors.

473
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:30,342
- What happens when they sober up?
- They're at sea.

474
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:33,468
Okay, get that one in there!
Shove him in good, please.

475
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:37,378
All right, good. He was a bit thin.
Those ones over there, they look good.

476
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,246
I say.

477
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,250
I'll give you three farthings,
young lady.

478
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,085
There we are. Oopsy daisy.

479
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,689
A good big one
will always beat a rotten little one.

480
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:03,569
What's going on, hey?
What do you think you're doing?

481
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,942
Just borrowing your jacket, Bosun.

482
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:25,165
I say, sir. I just saw two naval gentlemen
going the other way.

483
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:29,136
Where's Yellowbeard? Professor Anthrax.

484
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:32,706
He can't be far. He'll find us.
He needs that map.

485
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:35,434
Well, I hope he finds us
before they find him.

486
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,635
And it's not long before we sail.

487
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:41,848
Now, we know it's an island close
to Jamaica, and we've got the map of it.

488
00:39:41,948 --> 00:39:46,215
But without him to tell us which island,
we might as well go home.

489
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:53,216
Now, I'm sure some of you gentlemen
would like to volunteer...

490
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:57,956
for a well-paid,
well-fed adventure holiday...

491
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:00,601
such as youths dream of...

492
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:03,727
upon a modern, rat-free,
leak-proof ship!

493
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:08,575
Any volunteers just lie down on the ground
with your eyes shut.

494
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,215
Would you gentlemen
be looking for a ship?

495
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:14,515
- We...
- Well, as a matter of fact...

496
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:17,743
we're lucky enough already
to have tickets for the...

497
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:31,892
Load them on.

498
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,861
Take them to the ship.

499
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,317
- Come on, kick him out! Come on!
- Oh, my God!

500
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,509
He's thrown her in the water tub!

501
00:40:57,627 --> 00:41:00,357
- Take your hands off of me!
- Shut up and move!

502
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,657
I want these three shackled
in the bilges.

503
00:41:06,502 --> 00:41:07,800
Move over!

504
00:41:09,405 --> 00:41:10,573
Come on, old man.

505
00:41:10,673 --> 00:41:14,165
There's no need.
We can make our own way there.

506
00:41:16,614 --> 00:41:19,310
Sign here. I'll make your mark.

507
00:41:22,952 --> 00:41:25,854
- There's your shilling.
- Thank you, sir!

508
00:41:28,057 --> 00:41:30,754
Don't do that. Don't do that ever again.

509
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:39,103
- Get off, lad.
- All right. Come on, move it.

510
00:41:39,203 --> 00:41:42,036
I never noticed that hook
when he signed on.

511
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:43,640
Nor did I, sir.

512
00:41:44,808 --> 00:41:48,904
- He's right-handed, sir.
- Get rid of the others.

513
00:41:57,988 --> 00:41:59,183
Quiet!

514
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,631
- Mr. Crisp.
- Aye, sir!

515
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:12,901
What is that?

516
00:42:13,438 --> 00:42:17,603
- That's my box, sir.
- No, carrying your box.

517
00:42:18,678 --> 00:42:20,474
Cabin boy Smith, sir.

518
00:42:21,881 --> 00:42:25,450
- Smith has tits.
- He's been a bit ill, sir.

519
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,017
Get her off!

520
00:42:28,054 --> 00:42:29,043
Aye, sir.

521
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,781
Wait a minute.

522
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:35,992
What is that?

523
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:40,062
It's a crocodile, sir.

524
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,068
What's it for?

525
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:45,004
Well, each sailor is...

526
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,370
allowed, by tradition, a pet, sir.

527
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:51,978
One pet per sailor, parrots preferred.

528
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,517
Well, we like clubbed together,
as it were, if you take my drift, sir.

529
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:01,576
- That's bigger than three parrots.
- Not if they're in cages, sir.

530
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,119
Open it up.

531
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:06,393
Open it up?

532
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:09,394
Open it up!
There are buttons down the side.

533
00:43:15,602 --> 00:43:19,506
The ancient superstition
that a woman onboard brings bad luck...

534
00:43:19,606 --> 00:43:22,371
is now a proven scientific fact.

535
00:43:24,545 --> 00:43:26,206
Nice try, Rosie.

536
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,447
Shouldn't bother, love.
They're fairly strict on this one.

537
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:19,830
Rattus vulgaris.

538
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,406
- Yeah.
- You know, I've been thinking.

539
00:44:23,506 --> 00:44:26,676
If we paid 300 guineas each
for this cabin...

540
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:29,267
I'm glad we didn't go
for the cheaper ones.

541
00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:33,813
I'm sorry to interrupt
your morning bath, gentlemen.

542
00:44:34,384 --> 00:44:36,443
On your knees!

543
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:40,383
And crawl up here on the double!
Up here on the double!

544
00:44:42,892 --> 00:44:47,488
- All hands present, Mr. Crisp, sir!
- Thank you, Bosun!

545
00:44:48,532 --> 00:44:52,662
Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man,
preserve me from the violent man...

546
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:11,514
My name is Captain Hughes.

547
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:17,051
These are my officers, Lieutenant Martin,
who is responsible for discipline...

548
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:21,094
Lieutenant Crisp,
who is responsible for discipline...

549
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:25,359
Mr. Prostitute,
who is responsible for...

550
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:29,574
Nail that man's foot to the deck.

551
00:45:29,674 --> 00:45:31,009
- Aye, sir.
- Discipline.

552
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:34,946
No, I... It's all right.
No. I was just joking.

553
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:37,879
I was just having a...
Here, hang on. Hey, wait a minute.

554
00:45:43,656 --> 00:45:46,920
Now, in fairness to all of you...

555
00:45:47,826 --> 00:45:50,522
I'm honor bound to ask this question.

556
00:45:51,864 --> 00:45:56,460
Is there anyone here who does not wish
to be a member of Her Majesty's Navy?

557
00:45:58,671 --> 00:46:00,002
Me, sir.

558
00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:10,044
Is there anyone else
who is reluctant to serve?

559
00:46:14,153 --> 00:46:15,142
Right.

560
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:19,792
If, by chance, some of you may feel
that the discipline on this ship...

561
00:46:19,892 --> 00:46:23,920
is a trifle on the harsh side
of strict...

562
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,602
let me remind you that it is our duty
to seek out and destroy...

563
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,270
Her Majesty's enemies...

564
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,705
the foul...

565
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:35,002
and most foreign French.

566
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,910
- Here, here.
- Now...

567
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,747
while the rest of the world will eventually
arrive at the same conclusion...

568
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:43,441
it is our urgent task...

569
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:47,354
to push things on a little.

570
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,015
Amen.

571
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:54,184
Next.

572
00:46:56,129 --> 00:46:59,257
Mr. Martin, Mr. Prostitute...

573
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:01,367
luncheon duty.

574
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:16,844
Right, Mr. Beamish,
I'll see the prisoner now.

575
00:47:17,018 --> 00:47:18,152
Aye, aye, sir.

576
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,913
Man the capstan.

577
00:47:27,396 --> 00:47:30,422
- Ready to talk yet, Mrs. Beard?
- No!

578
00:47:30,898 --> 00:47:33,335
- Take her away, Mr. Beamish.
- Aye, aye, sir.

579
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:34,424
Down.

580
00:47:46,715 --> 00:47:49,685
Give them a taste of the lash
before they've done anything.

581
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:53,347
- Preventive punishment, that's the principle.
- Yes, sir.

582
00:47:55,158 --> 00:47:57,594
That man yawned.
Give him a swimming lesson.

583
00:47:57,694 --> 00:47:59,796
What, what? Hey! No.
Come on, wait a minute!

584
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:01,487
Wait a minute. No. Hey!

585
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,288
Thanks.

586
00:48:05,268 --> 00:48:07,463
- Well done, sir.
- Hold the line.

587
00:48:13,777 --> 00:48:15,074
Lovely day.

588
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,160
No! No!

589
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,196
No!

590
00:49:04,296 --> 00:49:05,490
Oh, no!

591
00:49:07,766 --> 00:49:09,334
Oh, no!

592
00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:11,732
Oh, what have we here? A laggard?

593
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:19,770
Oh, it's so hard
on a manicure, isn't it?

594
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:22,915
Not to worry, lad.

595
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:25,005
You'll get the hang of it.

596
00:49:33,493 --> 00:49:35,552
And third, Your Majesty...

597
00:49:36,728 --> 00:49:38,720
I'm very pleased to report...

598
00:49:39,398 --> 00:49:41,628
that after several very brave...

599
00:49:42,068 --> 00:49:44,832
and very expensive battles...

600
00:49:45,605 --> 00:49:47,664
the pirate Yellowbeard...

601
00:49:48,474 --> 00:49:50,965
is now well and truly...

602
00:49:51,244 --> 00:49:53,145
in our grasp.

603
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:01,209
Sir, is that, strictly speaking,
accurate, sir?

604
00:50:01,587 --> 00:50:05,614
Mansell, that's what
we in the Royal Navy call a lie.

605
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:08,562
A lie, sir? But that's treason,
isn't it?

606
00:50:08,662 --> 00:50:10,129
- Be quiet.
- Yes, sir.

607
00:50:10,229 --> 00:50:13,290
- Now get that off to Her Majesty right away.
- Yes, sir.

608
00:50:17,204 --> 00:50:18,501
How, sir?

609
00:50:19,106 --> 00:50:20,904
By pigeon, Mansell.

610
00:50:22,176 --> 00:50:23,177
Pigeon, sir?

611
00:50:23,277 --> 00:50:26,769
Surely you didn't forget
to bring the pigeon, Mansell?

612
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:41,419
Come in.

613
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:49,271
- I think she might be ready to talk now, sir.
- Right.

614
00:50:50,972 --> 00:50:54,909
I seem to remember something
about an island.

615
00:50:56,144 --> 00:51:00,844
It must have been that shark
what jogged my memory.

616
00:51:01,716 --> 00:51:03,183
Jolly good, Ensign.

617
00:51:04,486 --> 00:51:06,545
- Thank you, sir.
- Well done.

618
00:51:07,622 --> 00:51:09,989
Shall I meet you in the pump room, sir?

619
00:51:12,628 --> 00:51:14,152
Sit down, Mrs. Beard.

620
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,127
Now, about this island.

621
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:19,030
A little pigeon, perhaps?

622
00:51:19,802 --> 00:51:22,293
I've just ate some tuna, thank you.

623
00:51:28,644 --> 00:51:30,875
Where did I put that treasure?

624
00:51:31,147 --> 00:51:33,707
No, it's stagger. No, no, no.

625
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,380
Get shot, then fall...

626
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,256
then crawl, crawl...

627
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:41,324
then stagger, stagger.

628
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:48,732
Do you know that you have
three paying passengers onboard...

629
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:51,501
who are being treated
as abominably as the rest of the crew?

630
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:52,590
Really?

631
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,497
I think once the Captain realizes who we are,
we'll get an easier passage.

632
00:51:59,243 --> 00:52:00,733
Perfect. Let's go.

633
00:52:01,178 --> 00:52:04,148
Well, I can see there's only
one thing you'll understand.

634
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:06,648
And what, pray, might that be?

635
00:52:09,052 --> 00:52:11,453
Right! Let's finish it!

636
00:52:24,335 --> 00:52:27,964
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- What for?

637
00:52:29,307 --> 00:52:30,899
Interrupting you, sir.

638
00:52:31,643 --> 00:52:33,668
I was only smoking a cigar.

639
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:35,606
Yes, sir.

640
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:40,385
I came to tell you that the son of
Yellowbeard the pirate is onboard this ship.

641
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:42,953
The son of Yellowbeard the pirate?

642
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:47,417
Who's that?

643
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:51,219
That was Mr. Crisp, sir.

644
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,224
Mr. Crisp?

645
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:02,567
Officers and men of The Lady Edith...

646
00:53:02,942 --> 00:53:07,436
these three people posing as pressees,
are, in fact...

647
00:53:07,613 --> 00:53:09,342
foul stowaways.

648
00:53:09,749 --> 00:53:11,284
Stowaways? No!

649
00:53:11,384 --> 00:53:12,952
The perspicacity of Mr. Moon...

650
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:17,716
has led to the discovery
of a conspiracy against the Crown.

651
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:20,860
There's no doubt in my mind
that the one in the middle...

652
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,397
is the son of the evil Yellowbeard.

653
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:27,295
- Yellowbeard!
- He has already dispatched...

654
00:53:27,633 --> 00:53:30,501
dear Mr. Crisp to the deep...

655
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,972
clearly with the purpose
of taking over this vessel.

656
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:39,670
We shall deliver these traitors
to the proper authorities.

657
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,605
Set course for Portsmouth.

658
00:53:43,384 --> 00:53:45,545
You know what to do, Mr. Moon.

659
00:54:04,138 --> 00:54:05,332
Mutiny.

660
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,989
Oh, dear, the Captain
would appear to be out of sorts!

661
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:36,069
We're gonna have to choose a new captain.
Who shall it be?

662
00:54:36,504 --> 00:54:37,562
Me!

663
00:54:38,873 --> 00:54:42,207
- No. We want Dan!
- Dan?

664
00:54:43,212 --> 00:54:44,509
Or the prostitute.

665
00:54:49,084 --> 00:54:50,786
Dan.

666
00:54:50,886 --> 00:54:52,555
Who? Who? Come on!

667
00:54:52,655 --> 00:54:55,089
- Dan! Dan!
- Dan!

668
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:56,723
- We want Dan!
- Dan!

669
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:03,656
It's unanimous, then.

670
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:06,402
The ship's yours, Captain...

671
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,796
to take where you will.

672
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:17,470
That's it, that's it.

673
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:23,820
I hope you don't mind us
tying up the Captain like that, sir.

674
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,355
No, not at all.

675
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:27,855
Well, I was only following your lead.

676
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:32,357
I mean, well, your killing Mr. Crisp
was an example to us all.

677
00:55:32,864 --> 00:55:36,594
But I only hit him with a bucket,
and then everything went blank.

678
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,158
Oh, yeah.

679
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,303
It's like that, killing.

680
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:44,674
No hard feelings, Captain Hughes.

681
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,310
Your consideration will be noted.

682
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,778
Now, Bosun, set course for Madagascar.

683
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:55,841
Yes.

684
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:58,015
Right!

685
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:01,188
You heard what the Captain said.

686
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,893
- It's Madagascar.
- Aye, aye, sir.

687
00:56:10,669 --> 00:56:12,738
Set a course for Portsmouth, Mr. Martin.

688
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:13,939
Aye, aye, sir!

689
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:16,340
East by northeast, Mr. Prostitute.

690
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,908
Aye, aye, sir.

691
00:56:38,163 --> 00:56:42,361
All's well!

692
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:26,173
- Ah...
- S'well!

693
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,031
We went 10 degrees west
off course overnight.

694
00:57:53,508 --> 00:57:55,242
Did you notice that, Mr. Moon?

695
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:56,970
Indeed I did, sir.

696
00:57:57,545 --> 00:58:01,116
Our captain didn't bump
the helmsman off last night, did he?

697
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:04,413
No. Didn't leave his cabin, Mr. Moon.

698
00:58:05,287 --> 00:58:07,811
- Did you order a change of course?
- No.

699
00:58:11,693 --> 00:58:14,686
I think someone knows
where the island is.

700
00:58:16,531 --> 00:58:19,193
See? They're leading us right to it.

701
00:58:25,741 --> 00:58:28,539
Come on, Mrs. Beard.
We've been at this all day.

702
00:58:29,779 --> 00:58:32,043
No. No.

703
00:58:32,915 --> 00:58:35,179
That still doesn't look right.

704
00:58:35,652 --> 00:58:39,247
I don't think you're being as helpful
as you promised, Mrs. Beard.

705
00:58:39,355 --> 00:58:41,186
I'm doing my best.

706
00:58:42,158 --> 00:58:44,787
Perhaps a little more shark treatment?

707
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:52,163
Nothing in sight, sir.
Absolutely nothing at all.

708
00:58:52,335 --> 00:58:53,563
Nothing, sir!

709
00:58:53,904 --> 00:58:56,270
Talk about clear horizons, this is it.

710
00:58:56,773 --> 00:58:59,844
We've been at sea for weeks without
sighting anything, let alone The Edith.

711
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:01,605
Ship ahoy!

712
00:59:05,516 --> 00:59:07,676
Look lively, lads. Look lively.

713
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,053
There you are, sir. Nothing again.

714
00:59:15,492 --> 00:59:17,085
Nothing whatsoever.

715
00:59:21,966 --> 00:59:23,434
Behind you, Mansell.

716
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:25,024
I know you are, sir.

717
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:27,100
There's a ship behind you.

718
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,536
Good lord, sir! It's The Edith!

719
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,100
Sir?

720
00:59:39,484 --> 00:59:41,611
Of course it's The Edith, Mansell.

721
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,381
But, sir...

722
00:59:44,689 --> 00:59:47,692
it is behind us, and we're supposed
to be following it, sir.

723
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,727
Well, how can we be, sir?

724
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,703
- Strike the colors, Mr. Beamish.
- Strike the colors, Mr. Beamish.

725
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,638
- Hoist the French flag.
- Hoist the French flag.

726
00:59:59,738 --> 01:00:01,603
- Hard about.
- Hard about.

727
01:00:02,007 --> 01:00:03,609
They mustn't know
we're after them, Mansell.

728
01:00:03,709 --> 01:00:05,744
If we can convince them we're French,
they'll avoid us.

729
01:00:05,844 --> 01:00:08,972
Perhaps then we can return
to following them discreetly.

730
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:12,285
What sort of ship is it?

731
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:14,011
Some kind of frigate.

732
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:18,753
We wouldn't have come across it,
if we had kept our course.

733
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:20,951
No, no. We wouldn't.

734
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,731
There's a flag. They're French,
and they're rounding on us!

735
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,370
Stand by to fire.

736
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:30,766
Oh, dear.

737
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:32,932
Stand by to hide.

738
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:39,580
All right, Mansell, so we'll just
sail quietly past, all right?

739
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,647
Aye, aye, sir.

740
01:00:40,747 --> 01:00:43,216
Ready? Fire!

741
01:00:51,658 --> 01:00:54,261
- Are you all right, Mansell?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

742
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:55,529
Shit.

743
01:00:55,629 --> 01:00:57,297
What do the fools think they're doing?

744
01:00:57,397 --> 01:01:00,534
We outgun them. We outman them.
We're much faster than they are.

745
01:01:00,634 --> 01:01:03,437
I think it might have something to do
with the French flag we're flying, sir.

746
01:01:03,537 --> 01:01:07,409
All right, then to avoid suspicion,
we better appear to retaliate.

747
01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:09,601
We'll fire a bit and miss a lot.

748
01:01:09,844 --> 01:01:10,834
Fire!

749
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:19,450
Lower the guns!

750
01:01:21,222 --> 01:01:22,781
Fire!

751
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,784
Raise the guns!

752
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,295
Fire!

753
01:01:51,654 --> 01:01:53,588
More sail!

754
01:01:53,823 --> 01:01:55,188
More sail!

755
01:02:03,532 --> 01:02:06,335
- Clear the debris!
- Clear the debris!

756
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:09,273
- Carpenters to action!
- Carpenters to action!

757
01:02:09,373 --> 01:02:11,932
Jettison some ballast, Mr. McKenzie.

758
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:15,306
We must sail as fast as we can
without our sail.

759
01:02:17,748 --> 01:02:19,016
Well done, lad!

760
01:02:19,116 --> 01:02:21,015
This calls for a celebration.

761
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,208
Well done, Captain.

762
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,910
Oh, yes.

763
01:02:25,187 --> 01:02:27,816
No disrespect intended, Your Lordship.

764
01:03:06,564 --> 01:03:09,931
Straight back, head up and thrust.

765
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:12,036
Well done, Son.

766
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:15,903
- Straight back, head up and thrust.
- Captain.

767
01:03:25,783 --> 01:03:27,479
Get out, you coward.

768
01:03:34,526 --> 01:03:36,790
- Ebenezer.
- Yes, Percy?

769
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:40,032
- I've been thinking.
- Oh, yes?

770
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:42,829
Can brandy make you see things?

771
01:03:44,004 --> 01:03:47,496
- If you drink enough of it.
- Oh, that explains it.

772
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:52,043
- That island I thought I saw.
- Island?

773
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:55,971
- It is an island.
- Of course.

774
01:03:56,081 --> 01:03:57,378
It's beautiful.

775
01:04:10,797 --> 01:04:13,665
- Prepare the longboat, Mr. Tarbuck.
- Aye, aye, sir.

776
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:18,338
Now, men, a group of us are going
to put ashore here for provisions.

777
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:22,204
Provisions. Oh, yes. Of course, sir.

778
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:30,084
Could be a mirage.
Looks rather like a mirage I once saw.

779
01:04:30,184 --> 01:04:31,285
If I saw it.

780
01:04:31,385 --> 01:04:33,421
Is it anything like the map on my head?

781
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:35,580
This is the island.

782
01:05:21,904 --> 01:05:25,965
I gladly moisten your foot
with my nostrils, Your Barbarity.

783
01:05:29,479 --> 01:05:32,548
I have something very nice to show you.

784
01:05:32,648 --> 01:05:33,876
Excellent.

785
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:51,001
So, explain to me, Senor Verdugo...

786
01:05:51,101 --> 01:05:54,661
the intricacies of this
most holy instrument of confession.

787
01:05:55,438 --> 01:05:57,807
Triola, I don't think
you should see this, my daughter.

788
01:05:57,907 --> 01:06:01,378
- It's only another torture machine.
- I want it to be a surprise for you.

789
01:06:01,478 --> 01:06:04,037
- Later, my sweet.
- All right, Daddy.

790
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:07,084
- So, my new confessional.
- Yes, of course.

791
01:06:07,184 --> 01:06:11,656
But first, Your Severity,
you will notice that the instrument...

792
01:06:11,756 --> 01:06:15,459
is completely surrounded
by this pool of acid...

793
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:18,829
which will destroy anything
thrown into it...

794
01:06:18,929 --> 01:06:22,331
except gold and precious stones.

795
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,526
But flesh and bone and iron...

796
01:06:26,638 --> 01:06:27,934
Observe.

797
01:06:35,613 --> 01:06:36,773
Voilà!

798
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:42,020
And it doesn't dissolve gold, you say?

799
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:46,191
No. Not, of course.
Of course not, Your Vapidity.

800
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:50,752
Even if they have swallowed
their valuables, Your Severity...

801
01:06:51,196 --> 01:06:55,500
there would be no need for
those messy searches that we used to have.

802
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,269
Unless we want one.

803
01:06:57,369 --> 01:06:59,633
Of course, Your Outrageousness.

804
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,814
So this is my new confessional?

805
01:07:08,914 --> 01:07:13,146
Yes, it is. It works this way, Your Ferocity.
If you will, please.

806
01:07:14,053 --> 01:07:15,611
The prisoner...

807
01:07:16,155 --> 01:07:18,021
is totally restrained...

808
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:21,192
by means of this iron banding.

809
01:07:21,361 --> 01:07:23,192
Excellent. Excellent.

810
01:07:23,896 --> 01:07:28,061
But there is more to it than that,
Your Blizzard of the Wrong.

811
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:31,304
By means of these ratchets
and these screws...

812
01:07:31,404 --> 01:07:34,841
you can place his body
in any position that you want...

813
01:07:34,941 --> 01:07:39,105
for as long as you want
and do anything to it that you want.

814
01:07:39,813 --> 01:07:43,184
You can break every bone in his hand...

815
01:07:43,284 --> 01:07:45,218
one at a time.

816
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:47,013
- And feet?
- And the feet.

817
01:07:47,821 --> 01:07:49,156
I love it.

818
01:07:49,256 --> 01:07:51,192
- And the back?
- And the back.

819
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:55,251
- And slowly crush them and break them?
- Oh, yes.

820
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:59,095
It is very effective,
Your Acute Horrendousness.

821
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:02,803
People will be even more frightened of me
when they hear I have this.

822
01:08:02,903 --> 01:08:06,566
Oh, yes, definitely,
Your Blind Stupidity.

823
01:08:08,643 --> 01:08:10,634
Even you, Senor Verdugo?

824
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,148
Well, of course not me.

825
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:18,378
I mean, after all, I made it. I designed it.
It's my baby.

826
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,012
Well, let's see if it works.

827
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:27,822
If it does not work,
I shall dispatch you with heavenly force.

828
01:08:40,108 --> 01:08:43,579
Well, we could all do
with some good food and clean water.

829
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,580
- Mr. Moon, prepare a hunting party.
- Aye, aye, sir.

830
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:49,318
Why don't you go ahead and forage...

831
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:53,287
and me and a few of the lads'll stay behind
and guard the boat?

832
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:55,416
Very good, Mr. Moon.

833
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:09,765
There's a beach like this, which ought to be
on the other side of the island.

834
01:09:11,107 --> 01:09:13,974
We'll cover more ground if we separate.

835
01:09:14,812 --> 01:09:18,247
We'll have every gun on that ship ready
for them when they return.

836
01:09:18,948 --> 01:09:20,472
Bosun Gilbert.

837
01:09:21,919 --> 01:09:24,819
Aye, aye, Captain Moon.

838
01:11:08,695 --> 01:11:10,356
Bloody murderers.

839
01:11:26,481 --> 01:11:28,175
Unhand me, you heathens.

840
01:11:34,856 --> 01:11:35,844
Percy...

841
01:11:36,057 --> 01:11:39,560
I think I found the tree that
that paralyzing liquid comes from.

842
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,652
Just stab some under the skin and...

843
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:45,395
You do what?

844
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,467
Stab some...

845
01:11:48,369 --> 01:11:49,802
Oh, that.

846
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,844
They've captured Dan.

847
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:01,643
Ebenezer, look.

848
01:12:02,216 --> 01:12:03,184
Who?

849
01:12:03,284 --> 01:12:05,753
Shall we send for reinforcements...

850
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:07,822
or capture them now?

851
01:12:12,327 --> 01:12:13,589
Wait a minute.

852
01:12:14,429 --> 01:12:15,919
What's that?

853
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:24,066
Good Lord.

854
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,031
How did he get here?

855
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,870
There's our reinforcement.

856
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:40,851
Seems to have taken a mild dislike
to the priests.

857
01:13:08,519 --> 01:13:12,216
Come on, men. Let's rescue Captain Dan.

858
01:13:12,923 --> 01:13:14,325
Not likely, mate.

859
01:13:14,425 --> 01:13:15,727
And the treasure.

860
01:13:15,827 --> 01:13:18,590
- Right you are, mate.
- Be right with you.

861
01:13:20,464 --> 01:13:22,666
- No, no, I can't. Leave me alone.
- Come on, come on, please.

862
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,598
He'll come back.
He'll kill you. You see?

863
01:13:25,436 --> 01:13:27,097
Your Assholiness.

864
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:33,806
Greetings, Your Vehemence.

865
01:13:36,214 --> 01:13:37,448
Mission accomplished.

866
01:13:37,548 --> 01:13:39,885
By the grace of God
and heavenly force...

867
01:13:39,985 --> 01:13:42,920
five heathen souls
have attained eternal serenity.

868
01:13:43,955 --> 01:13:45,513
Only five?

869
01:13:46,691 --> 01:13:48,360
Was there any money?

870
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,894
On the paltry side, Your Barbarity.

871
01:13:52,464 --> 01:13:56,025
So your mission was as so much fart gas.

872
01:13:56,969 --> 01:13:58,604
Oh, no, Your Offensiveness.

873
01:13:58,704 --> 01:14:01,440
The ship that they came on
was after Yellowbeard's treasure.

874
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,841
Yellowbeard?

875
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:04,510
Oh, no, no. He is not here.

876
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:06,679
Just the men
who came looking for his treasure.

877
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:09,508
This is one of their officers,
Your Molestation.

878
01:14:10,182 --> 01:14:11,984
The treasure of Yellowbeard.

879
01:14:12,084 --> 01:14:13,880
Now I am the richest...

880
01:14:15,154 --> 01:14:17,452
You must find out everything he knows.

881
01:14:17,556 --> 01:14:19,387
I have just the thing.

882
01:14:35,508 --> 01:14:37,374
Oh, my head.

883
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:40,480
And my foot and my back.

884
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,013
Mon Dieu, it works.

885
01:14:42,115 --> 01:14:44,617
You may torture me,
but it will avail you nothing.

886
01:14:44,717 --> 01:14:47,084
We'll see about that, sailor.

887
01:15:05,139 --> 01:15:09,803
Captain Moon, sir, they've captured Dan,
and they're setting a trap for the others.

888
01:15:10,078 --> 01:15:11,374
Excellent.

889
01:15:11,779 --> 01:15:15,579
They're making it easy for us.
Well done, Gilbert.

890
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:34,267
Is it too cold for you?

891
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,596
No, I'm all right.

892
01:15:37,406 --> 01:15:41,467
You must tell my father where
the treasure is, or you will surely die.

893
01:15:41,677 --> 01:15:42,911
I'll tell him nothing.

894
01:15:43,011 --> 01:15:46,115
But he only wants it
for the grace and glory of God.

895
01:15:46,215 --> 01:15:49,418
What kind of God is it
that kills and tortures men?

896
01:15:49,518 --> 01:15:51,920
My father's only purpose
is to enable heathen souls...

897
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,581
to enter heaven more rapidly
than they would of their own accord.

898
01:15:56,091 --> 01:15:57,615
Please tell him.

899
01:15:58,161 --> 01:15:59,928
It hurts me to see you hurt.

900
01:16:00,028 --> 01:16:03,465
It hurts me to see you be hurt
by me being hurt.

901
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:06,369
I think I love you.

902
01:16:06,469 --> 01:16:07,971
You're right, you do.

903
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:09,628
And I love you.

904
01:16:10,106 --> 01:16:13,200
And when I am rescued,
I want you to come with me.

905
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:16,207
But to come with you
would mean leaving here.

906
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,140
- Are you taking the treasure?
- That's right.

907
01:16:22,353 --> 01:16:24,622
Triola, you realize your father
may be killed?

908
01:16:24,722 --> 01:16:27,757
Oh, Daddy won't mind.
He's a bit odd about things like that.

909
01:16:27,857 --> 01:16:29,655
I must pack my things.

910
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,505
Excuse me, Your Monstrosity.

911
01:16:49,013 --> 01:16:51,709
Our prisoner here
must be very importante.

912
01:16:52,016 --> 01:16:55,281
There seems to be quite a little army
gathering down there.

913
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,621
- Could it be their leader?
- No.

914
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,861
But there is a man
of very high rank giving orders.

915
01:17:02,961 --> 01:17:05,360
He would know where the treasure is.

916
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:07,692
He is the one we must capture.

917
01:17:08,934 --> 01:17:11,837
That would be very difficult,
O Berserk One.

918
01:17:11,937 --> 01:17:15,600
He would be the last in the attack
and the first to escape.

919
01:17:16,106 --> 01:17:18,007
Typical leader for you.

920
01:17:19,044 --> 01:17:20,512
What did you say?

921
01:17:20,612 --> 01:17:23,604
I said, except for you,
O Mindless Slaughterer.

922
01:17:28,653 --> 01:17:30,780
That's the answer. Yeah.

923
01:17:32,592 --> 01:17:36,824
We will lure their leader to the front
by allowing their attack to succeed.

924
01:17:37,163 --> 01:17:38,151
Yes.

925
01:17:38,264 --> 01:17:42,826
We will pretend to resist and fake injury
and death when they attack.

926
01:17:45,136 --> 01:17:48,470
Excuse me,
why are you banging your head like that?

927
01:17:50,508 --> 01:17:52,341
- Was I?
- Yes, you was.

928
01:17:53,079 --> 01:17:55,377
We all seen you, you silly man.

929
01:17:55,548 --> 01:17:56,849
Excuse me.

930
01:17:56,949 --> 01:18:01,943
Yes, and when the invaders reach
the throne room, my men will rise up...

931
01:18:02,456 --> 01:18:05,982
and dispatch all
with majestic heavenly force.

932
01:18:07,326 --> 01:18:09,852
Magnificent strategy, Your Arrogance.

933
01:18:10,129 --> 01:18:12,325
But it must look realistic.

934
01:18:12,532 --> 01:18:14,624
Anyone caught overacting...

935
01:18:15,235 --> 01:18:17,702
I will personally scare to death.

936
01:18:19,373 --> 01:18:21,773
- Alms for the poor.
- Social parasite.

937
01:18:22,376 --> 01:18:23,443
Take the donkey.

938
01:18:23,543 --> 01:18:25,135
- My bowl. Where is my bowl?
- Come on, burro!

939
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,349
Hold on, men.

940
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:33,147
This way.

941
01:18:34,455 --> 01:18:36,286
Welcome to our trap.

942
01:18:40,994 --> 01:18:42,552
Come on, Ebenezer.

943
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:48,598
Now everyone wait for my signal.
Oh, except you.

944
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,967
That is pathetic!

945
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,907
- What?
- What about this, sir?

946
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:38,719
Go back to your position. Go on!

947
01:19:41,123 --> 01:19:42,751
So far, so good.

948
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:45,458
This way, men.

949
01:20:04,915 --> 01:20:06,815
Vasquez, don't overdo it.

950
01:20:10,887 --> 01:20:13,516
- Alms for the poor.
- On guard.

951
01:20:15,525 --> 01:20:16,823
And you.

952
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:20,625
Jolly good.

953
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:23,598
Touché.

954
01:20:34,779 --> 01:20:36,076
Good shot.

955
01:20:43,855 --> 01:20:45,481
Look at this, sir.

956
01:20:51,997 --> 01:20:53,555
This is terrible!

957
01:20:54,499 --> 01:20:57,434
I will have no more bad acting!

958
01:21:25,932 --> 01:21:27,900
- That was great. Bravo.
- Cool.

959
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,592
Bravo.

960
01:21:34,173 --> 01:21:36,107
What do you make of it?

961
01:21:41,414 --> 01:21:43,439
Dead. Entirely.

962
01:21:48,088 --> 01:21:49,646
Release that man.

963
01:21:50,457 --> 01:21:52,925
You have fallen for
one of my least likely plans.

964
01:21:55,863 --> 01:21:58,865
Stand up, men.
Come on, you guys. Up. Up.

965
01:21:58,965 --> 01:22:01,201
I administered a drop of this to them all...

966
01:22:01,301 --> 01:22:03,235
just as a precaution.

967
01:22:03,937 --> 01:22:07,909
Well, then, you give me no choice.
I shall have to... I shall have to...

968
01:22:08,009 --> 01:22:09,209
give up completely.

969
01:22:09,309 --> 01:22:11,777
Sorry about that.
Sorry, sorry, everyone.

970
01:22:11,879 --> 01:22:14,508
I'll go free your friend, then, shall I?

971
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:22,924
I'm much too fiendish
for the likes of you white-faced persons.

972
01:22:23,024 --> 01:22:26,094
Your friend, who you value so highly,
is in my power.

973
01:22:26,194 --> 01:22:28,596
- Well, what sort of power?
- What?

974
01:22:28,696 --> 01:22:31,599
Well, what sort of power do you have?

975
01:22:31,699 --> 01:22:34,203
My divine right
to command over life and death.

976
01:22:34,303 --> 01:22:37,338
- That sort of power.
- That sort of power, yes.

977
01:22:37,438 --> 01:22:40,875
I thought perhaps
you meant mechanical energy.

978
01:22:40,975 --> 01:22:44,206
As ruler,
my supremacy is absolute on this island.

979
01:22:44,712 --> 01:22:47,383
I thought this was an atoll.

980
01:22:47,483 --> 01:22:50,753
- Not at all. Not an atoll.
- No, not an atoll? Oh, no. What is it, then?

981
01:22:50,853 --> 01:22:53,322
- This is an isthmus.
- Isthmus.

982
01:22:53,422 --> 01:22:56,152
Silence and obey,
or I shall kill your captain.

983
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,691
Yellowbeard.

984
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,835
Father, we thought you were dead.

985
01:23:05,935 --> 01:23:09,271
Us Yellowbeards are never more dangerous
than when we're dead.

986
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:11,601
How you getting on pirating?

987
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:15,034
- Well...
- How many men have you killed so far?

988
01:23:15,178 --> 01:23:17,180
One. Two, I think.

989
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,772
You think? You'll never kill anyone
if you go around thinking.

990
01:23:22,485 --> 01:23:23,713
Triola.

991
01:23:25,255 --> 01:23:26,923
I don't think you've met my father.

992
01:23:27,023 --> 01:23:30,356
Been out raping, lad? Nice work, lad.

993
01:23:31,094 --> 01:23:32,429
No, I haven't raped her.

994
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:34,564
No, you wouldn't have,
you poncey little git.

995
01:23:34,664 --> 01:23:37,567
You're not the prawn of my loins.
Your mother's a bloody liar.

996
01:23:37,667 --> 01:23:39,070
That's what I liked about her.

997
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,540
She couldn't be your mother.
No woman ever slept with me and lived.

998
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,108
- What's happened to Daddy?
- I killed him.

999
01:23:45,408 --> 01:23:46,877
He's gone to heaven.

1000
01:23:46,977 --> 01:23:50,147
Oh, that's nice.
He sent all his friends there.

1001
01:23:50,247 --> 01:23:51,983
She's yours, is she then, Dan?

1002
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:54,685
Let me have a bit
of a prod at her first.

1003
01:23:54,785 --> 01:23:56,946
- Father!
- Captain Dan!

1004
01:23:57,188 --> 01:23:59,156
Captain Dan. It's Mr...

1005
01:24:02,593 --> 01:24:04,618
- Who?
- It's...

1006
01:24:06,198 --> 01:24:08,631
It's Mr. Moon.

1007
01:24:09,201 --> 01:24:11,602
Moon? That shithead Moon?

1008
01:24:11,702 --> 01:24:14,006
It's time I got rid of him.

1009
01:24:14,106 --> 01:24:16,408
Dad, stop.
Look, we'll all fight Mr. Moon.

1010
01:24:16,508 --> 01:24:19,374
Oh, good. Another battle.
Well done, Son.

1011
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:21,071
Dan.

1012
01:24:26,251 --> 01:24:29,550
Come on, men. Let's go get our treasure.

1013
01:24:38,897 --> 01:24:40,331
So long, mate.

1014
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:43,902
Don't worry. I'll spend your share.

1015
01:24:44,002 --> 01:24:48,302
- No, you won't, Mr. Moon.
- It's little Captain Dan, huh?

1016
01:24:49,574 --> 01:24:50,577
Yellowbeard!

1017
01:24:50,677 --> 01:24:53,305
Moon, you bastard, what betrayed me.

1018
01:24:56,082 --> 01:25:00,382
I'm gonna make you eat
both your own buttocks.

1019
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:07,783
I've got a score to settle with you,
Captain Yellowbeard.

1020
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:19,900
Good girl.

1021
01:25:34,221 --> 01:25:36,655
Hold your throat on this sword.

1022
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:47,332
He's all yours, lad.

1023
01:26:27,276 --> 01:26:28,766
Dan, watch out.

1024
01:26:58,508 --> 01:26:59,805
Get going!

1025
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:03,309
Great shot, young lady.

1026
01:27:09,586 --> 01:27:11,088
Later, Triola. I must find my father.

1027
01:27:11,188 --> 01:27:14,521
You mean Yellowbeard? He went that way.

1028
01:27:18,028 --> 01:27:19,791
Well, Commander Clement...

1029
01:27:19,897 --> 01:27:23,992
I had high hopes
you would consider sharing.

1030
01:27:24,101 --> 01:27:26,804
Just lead me to Yellowbeard's treasure,
Mrs. Beard.

1031
01:27:26,904 --> 01:27:28,632
- That's all I want.
- Right.

1032
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:31,733
Well, as I recall...

1033
01:27:32,777 --> 01:27:34,946
it should be in that direction.

1034
01:27:35,046 --> 01:27:38,777
Let's see, that's stagger, stagger,
crawl, crawl...

1035
01:27:39,851 --> 01:27:43,617
No, that's crawl, crawl. Right.

1036
01:27:46,624 --> 01:27:47,989
Crawl, sir?

1037
01:27:48,927 --> 01:27:50,326
Come on, men.

1038
01:27:51,129 --> 01:27:53,620
Right, right.

1039
01:27:57,168 --> 01:28:00,939
Stagger, stagger, right and jump.

1040
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:02,841
- And stagger.
- Jump.

1041
01:28:02,941 --> 01:28:06,934
- Stagger, stagger, jump.
- Jump. Wait for me, sir.

1042
01:28:07,613 --> 01:28:10,249
It's quite goodexercise this,
really, isn't it?

1043
01:28:10,349 --> 01:28:13,841
Get shot, stagger, stagger, stagger...

1044
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:16,455
roll...

1045
01:28:16,555 --> 01:28:21,390
stagger, stagger,
stagger a little bit, then...

1046
01:28:22,361 --> 01:28:25,799
stagger, stagger, crawl, stagger...

1047
01:28:25,899 --> 01:28:28,594
stagger, stagger, roll...

1048
01:28:30,703 --> 01:28:33,228
and crawl, crawl, crawl...

1049
01:28:33,873 --> 01:28:37,110
- stagger, stagger, stagger...
- Father, are you all right?

1050
01:28:37,210 --> 01:28:40,646
- ...stagger, stagger, stagger...
- Father?

1051
01:28:42,382 --> 01:28:45,319
You made me forget where I was,
you stupid little sod.

1052
01:28:45,419 --> 01:28:46,820
- What were you doing?
- Shut up!

1053
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,590
Did I just say stagger or was it crawl?

1054
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:51,358
- I don't know.
- It was crawl.

1055
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:54,261
But was it crawl to the right,
crawl to the left...

1056
01:28:54,361 --> 01:28:58,699
or crawl, crawl, then to the right,
then stagger? Or was it...

1057
01:28:58,799 --> 01:29:00,500
Oh, bugger me,
you've sodded the whole thing up...

1058
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,470
like the stupid little twerp
that you are.

1059
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:06,040
I was recreating what happened to me
20 years ago, man and boy.

1060
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,441
Why didn't you stay with us?

1061
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:10,339
- Because I wanted to betray you.
- But why?

1062
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:12,981
I had to.
Betraying's all part of pirating.

1063
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,483
If you don't know that,
you're not even close to being a pirate.

1064
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:18,074
- Prawn of my loins, my foot.
- What?

1065
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,488
You're either born a pirate or not.

1066
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:24,392
It's in the blood, Dan, and it's not in your
blood, or you'd have betrayed me long ago.

1067
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:27,529
All right, I may not be a pirate,
but at least I've got a brain in my head...

1068
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,297
so why don't we
just follow the instructions?

1069
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:30,556
Right.

1070
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,494
Right.

1071
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:41,604
Six paces north, left at the rock,
then four paces west.

1072
01:29:43,078 --> 01:29:44,647
Right, come on, lad.

1073
01:29:44,747 --> 01:29:48,114
Give us a hand.
Stride, stride, stagger left...

1074
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:50,741
stride, stride, then dig.

1075
01:29:51,754 --> 01:29:54,449
Go on, make yourself useful, lad.

1076
01:29:55,758 --> 01:29:57,993
You know, the way you was
fighting back there...

1077
01:29:58,093 --> 01:30:00,530
there may be some pirate blood in you,
after all.

1078
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:03,895
Well, I did have a hand
in forcing Mr. Moon into the acid.

1079
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:08,261
With your head on my shoulders,
we can wreck civilization.

1080
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,577
- And stagger and jump and jump...
- Keep hopping.

1081
01:30:13,677 --> 01:30:15,338
...and stagger and stagger and jump.

1082
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:20,941
Go on, Dan, use your dagger.

1083
01:30:25,689 --> 01:30:28,920
- Look at it all.
- Hip, hip, hooray!

1084
01:30:29,593 --> 01:30:32,892
- Triola, we're rich.
- Come on, Dan.

1085
01:30:34,297 --> 01:30:36,230
Congratulations, Father.

1086
01:30:38,168 --> 01:30:40,159
But I didn't...

1087
01:30:40,771 --> 01:30:43,763
- You are a Yellowbeard.
- What?

1088
01:30:46,176 --> 01:30:50,306
Killing your father
as I killed my father before me.

1089
01:30:51,983 --> 01:30:54,451
- Dad, the blood.
- Blood.

1090
01:30:56,853 --> 01:30:58,879
That's what I like to hear.

1091
01:30:59,624 --> 01:31:01,615
You are my son.

1092
01:31:09,367 --> 01:31:11,426
Halt, in the name of the law!

1093
01:31:13,204 --> 01:31:16,230
Well done there, lad. Got him at last.

1094
01:31:16,607 --> 01:31:18,376
All right, men. Keep your guns on him.

01:31:18,476 --> 01:31:22,846
Hello, Dan. Hello, lambchop.
Wonderful to see you.

1096
01:31:23,081 --> 01:31:24,682
Pity about your dad.

1097
01:31:24,782 --> 01:31:28,354
On the other hand, it is the way
what he said he always wanted to go.

1098
01:31:28,454 --> 01:31:29,785
Horribly.

1099
01:31:30,888 --> 01:31:33,255
Commander Clement, Royal Navy.

1100
01:31:34,126 --> 01:31:37,830
- I claim this treasure...
- He claims it?

1101
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:40,763
...in the name of Her Majesty,
Queen Anne.

1102
01:31:40,866 --> 01:31:44,427
Dan, darling,
I don't think I love you anymore.

1103
01:31:44,803 --> 01:31:46,771
You're right. You don't.

1104
01:31:47,107 --> 01:31:48,540
Goodbye, Triola.

1105
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:51,576
There's at least two more chests
down there.

1106
01:31:51,778 --> 01:31:54,541
You'll be a duke now, sir.
Won't you, sir?

1107
01:31:55,347 --> 01:31:57,645
Duty, Mansell. That's my reward.

1108
01:31:58,585 --> 01:31:59,846
Duke, eh?

1109
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:04,289
You've got a lovely bottom, blue eyes.

1110
01:32:04,656 --> 01:32:06,682
- I think I love you.
- What?

1111
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,230
She said you've got a lovely bottom,
sir, and...

1112
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:12,161
- Shut up, Mansell.
- Yes, sir.

1113
01:32:12,732 --> 01:32:15,964
- Right, Mansell, clap those people in irons.
- Sir.

1114
01:32:20,373 --> 01:32:22,967
You poor dear. You must have suffered.

1115
01:32:23,309 --> 01:32:26,245
- Tell me about it.
- It was simply awful.

1116
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:41,155
Sir, I was just thinking...

1117
01:32:41,762 --> 01:32:44,365
Her Majesty can have no idea...

1118
01:32:44,465 --> 01:32:47,229
how much treasure we've got.
Can she, sir?

1119
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:49,727
No, she can't.

1120
01:32:50,705 --> 01:32:52,865
- Have one yourself.
- Thank you, sir.

1121
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:56,434
Or even where we are.

1122
01:32:58,145 --> 01:32:59,579
I say, sir.

1123
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:05,318
Mansell, are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

1124
01:33:05,587 --> 01:33:07,953
I'll think whatever you say, sir.

1125
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:12,316
Ever been to the Americas?

1126
01:33:17,065 --> 01:33:20,728
Us Yellowbeards are never more dangerous
than when we're dead.

1127
01:33:21,737 --> 01:33:22,863
Dan.

1128
01:33:24,973 --> 01:33:26,703
I think I love you.

1129
01:33:27,009 --> 01:33:29,876
Come on, lad,
there's pirating to be done.

1130
01:33:30,305 --> 01:34:30,721
