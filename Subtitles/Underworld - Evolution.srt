2
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:31,600
My God.
Brother, what have you done?

3
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:52,371
Yet again we arrive to witness
this monster's aftermath.

4
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:57,543
I will not tolerate this
any longer, Marcus.

5
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,962
Your brother must be stopped.

6
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:02,214
It ends tonight.

7
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,884
We must move quickly,
before they turn.

8
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:10,639
Is he still here?

9
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:12,724
Yes.

10
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,727
Viktor, he must not be harmed.

11
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:18,063
I gave you my word, did I not?

12
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,149
But William must be controlled.

13
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,696
Burn the bodies.

14
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:27,823
Search the outbuildings.

15
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,992
Form two groups.
You, douse them with fuel.

16
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:31,660
- Yes, sir.
- Marcus.

17
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,496
Stay with me.

18
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:16,830
Give me the torch.

19
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,961
They're turning!

20
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,423
They're turning!

21
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:05,063
- Retreat to the woods.
- I'll stay and fight. You need my help.

22
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,982
I need you alive.

23
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,483
If you die, we all die.

24
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,818
Now, go.

25
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,862
Go!

26
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,472
- We found him.
- And?

27
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,183
- We need more men.
- Find Amelia.

28
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,486
Amelia, we found William.

29
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,639
Surround him!

30
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:25,519
Take him down.

31
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,195
No.

32
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,990
Leave him be.

33
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,121
Stop this, you're killing him.

34
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:48,667
More!

35
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:14,568
William.

36
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,027
Marcus!

37
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:19,406
He was not to be harmed.

38
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,908
Place him in my charge
as we agreed...

39
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,077
...or you will pay for your deceit.

40
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,955
And you will learn your place.

41
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:30,125
Your sympathy for this beast
is foolish.

42
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:33,086
Your brother is entirely
beyond control.

43
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,838
It will be done my way.

44
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:38,508
You know well the consequences
if you murder me...

45
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,926
...or William.

46
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:43,555
If you so much as speak
his name again...

47
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:46,141
...you will have chosen
that future for him.

48
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,612
What is thy will, my lord?

49
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:02,824
Imprisonment for all time.

50
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:06,286
Far from you.

51
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,342
For six centuries I was a loyal soldier
of the Vampire clan.

52
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,554
But I was betrayed.

53
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:29,100
The war was not as it had seemed.

54
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:34,147
In one night, the lies that had united
our kind had been exposed.

55
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:37,108
Kraven, our second-in-command...

56
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,778
...had formed a secret alliance
with Lucian...

57
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:41,988
...ruler of the Werewolf clan...

58
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:44,699
...to overthrow Viktor, our leader.

59
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,204
But Kraven's lust for power
and domination had failed.

60
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,709
Viktor was not the savior
I had been led to believe.

61
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,297
He had betrayed us all.

62
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:09,474
Soon the hunt will be on
for his killer.

63
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:15,730
I have but one ally left:

64
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:17,524
Michael...

65
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,360
...the human descendant
of Corvinus.

66
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:23,613
Neither Vampire nor Lycan...

67
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,615
...but a hybrid.

68
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,954
It's only a matter of time
before we're found.

69
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:56,563
My only hope now
is to awaken Marcus...

70
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,149
...our last remaining elder...

71
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:01,026
...and expose the truth...

72
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:05,655
...before Kraven tries to murder him
while he's still in hibernation.

73
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,869
Kraven knows
he's no match for him awake.

74
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:49,908
Perfect.

75
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:25,360
This thing's been dead for weeks.

76
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:28,238
I thought Lycans went back
to their human form when they die.

77
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,949
They do. It's been given
a serum to stop regression...

78
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,951
...so it can be studied.

79
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:34,327
How can you tell?

80
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:44,212
Not quite your department, I guess.

81
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:47,799
I just killed them. I didn't pay
much attention to their anatomy.

82
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,094
- How long can we stay here?
- Not long.

83
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:53,805
These safe houses are
linked together on one mainframe...

84
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:56,558
...with motion sensors revealing
which ones are active.

85
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:59,102
Someone could have
picked us up already.

86
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,320
There's only about an hour
till daylight.

87
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:11,948
Can you make it back
to the mansion before sunrise?

88
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:14,826
- Just.
- Okay, let's get what we need and go.

89
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,995
No.

90
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:20,123
I'm going alone.

91
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,102
Open it.

92
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,750
Marcus?

93
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:32,797
The blood memories
of this wretched creature...

94
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:39,095
...have shown me that your treachery
knows no bounds.

95
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:42,932
My lord, I can explain.

96
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:46,644
Why would I listen to your lies...

97
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,772
...when the journey to the truth...

98
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:56,237
...is so much sweeter?

99
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:06,789
I kept his secrets,
cleaned up the mess.

100
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:09,125
You'll go before Viktor...

101
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,669
...and tell him
exactly what I tell you to!

102
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,423
You just concentrate on your part.

103
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,060
Please.

104
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:30,188
I can assist you.

105
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:32,565
Oh, you already have.

106
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,823
If I can plead my case...

107
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,117
...there's a chance
you'll be granted sanctuary.

108
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:46,204
Right now, you'll be killed on sight.
I'm not prepared to risk it.

109
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:47,789
What am I supposed to do, wait?

110
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:50,667
Kraven may still have men with him.
You're not going alone.

111
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,710
You're not as strong
as you might think.

112
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:55,546
- What?
- Michael, you're unique.

113
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:57,757
There's never been a hybrid before.

114
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,552
However ambivalent you feel about it,
your powers could be limitless.

115
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:02,970
But you depend on blood.

116
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,264
You need to feed.

117
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,018
Without it, you'll be growing weaker
by the second. Use the time for that.

118
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:11,229
Jesus Christ.

119
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:13,981
And what if I don't?

120
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:15,692
What if I can't?

121
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,777
Normal food could be lethal.

122
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,780
If you don't anticipate your cravings,
you will attack humans.

123
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:24,117
And believe me, you don't want that
on your conscience.

124
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,744
There really is
no going back, Michael.

125
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,040
I'm sorry.

126
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,668
Look, I understand what you did.

127
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:35,628
I'm grateful.

128
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,798
You saved my life.

129
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:40,675
I wasn't ready to die.

130
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,265
I don't know.

131
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:48,599
Everything's changed.

132
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,519
I probably need a minute
to make it all fit in my head.

133
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:53,813
It's a lot to process all at once.

134
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,693
Look, go. I'll be here.

135
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,779
You just make sure you come back.

136
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:28,282
Sir.

137
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:30,910
The innocent who witnessed...

138
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,411
...they've been silenced?

139
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:35,164
But otherwise unharmed,
as ordered.

140
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:41,963
- Show me what you have.
- Yes, sir.

141
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:48,886
Two Death Dealers were killed.

142
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,930
We found no Lycan bodies.

143
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:53,558
Apparently they were using
a new kind of ammunition...

144
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:55,685
...some sort of UV round.

145
00:18:56,853 --> 00:18:57,979
Amelia?

146
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:01,983
No one survived.

147
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:04,569
It seems Kraven's men
might have been present...

148
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:07,572
...but they did nothing to prevent it.

149
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,615
And Viktor?

150
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:33,139
And no trace of Marcus
amongst the ashes?

151
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,058
It seems he destroyed
his own coven, sir.

152
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:39,437
It was never his coven.

153
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:05,588
We need to go.

154
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,175
Give me a moment.

155
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,440
There you are.

156
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:15,296
How you doing?

157
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,235
Thank you.

158
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,653
You've got to get away from me.

159
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:05,489
Get away from me!

160
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:19,003
Hello?

161
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:26,677
There.

162
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:30,180
Michael Corvin.

163
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:31,682
Get the men up there. Now.

164
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,194
Get the fuck away from me.

165
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:11,722
Stop. Stop.

166
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,729
Shit.

167
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,693
Michael. Oh, shit.

168
00:28:54,658 --> 00:28:57,369
- Here. Take it.
- No.

169
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,621
Michael, you'll die.

170
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:26,982
Shit.

171
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,026
Can you move?

172
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:34,656
We need to go.

173
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:56,845
Marcus.

174
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:59,515
I know what you've done, Selene.

175
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,643
Viktor deserved his fate
and Kraven was no better.

176
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:07,981
Kraven has already reaped
the rewards of his own misdeeds.

177
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:09,983
And Viktor...

178
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,861
Viktor deserved his fate...

179
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:14,446
...many times over.

180
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:18,075
A terrible business...

181
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:20,118
...the slaying of your family.

182
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,330
Yet so much effort was spent...

183
00:30:23,497 --> 00:30:25,791
...to conceal this matter from me.

184
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:31,004
What do you suppose
Viktor had to hide?

185
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:35,259
Or perhaps it is you, Selene...

186
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:40,931
...as the last
of your wretched family...

187
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,976
...who has something to hide.

188
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:55,028
Go!

189
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,732
Get in.

190
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:43,303
Dead or alive,
you will give me what I want.

191
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,044
You okay?

192
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,217
- He's a hybrid, isn't he?
- Yes.

193
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,679
He wanted this. Why?

194
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:10,474
I don't know.

195
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,851
But we have another problem.

196
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,274
Turn off up here.

197
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,073
Shit. All right, get down.

198
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:30,160
Keep your foot on the gas,
but stay down.

199
00:34:45,926 --> 00:34:47,761
Hold on.

200
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:04,110
Stay down.

201
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,208
Come on.

202
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,269
Give me your hand.

203
00:36:19,436 --> 00:36:20,979
Jesus Christ.

204
00:36:22,606 --> 00:36:24,441
There's really no need.

205
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:26,276
I'll be right back.

206
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,169
All right, let me see.

207
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,717
See?

208
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:52,510
No need.

209
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:41,906
Area secure, sir.

210
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:11,037
Sun's setting.

211
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,457
What's wrong?

212
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:24,092
The supplies were taken.
Used weapons were left behind.

213
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:27,637
The tavern events occurred before
dawn, so they couldn't have got far.

214
00:42:27,804 --> 00:42:30,598
Remain airborne for the moment.
I'm sure they'll reappear...

215
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:33,393
...in good time.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:40,525
I've seen this before,
when I was a child.

217
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,277
I've held it.

218
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:43,987
When it was open, like this.

219
00:42:44,153 --> 00:42:45,405
How is that possible?

220
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:49,409
I don't know.

221
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:53,329
But I know someone that might.

222
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,040
Andreas Tanis.

223
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,085
He was the official historian
of the covens.

224
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:05,341
He fell from favor after documenting
what Viktor considered malicious lies.

225
00:43:05,508 --> 00:43:08,261
Of course, as it turns out,
he was probably telling the truth.

226
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:09,762
What happened to him?

227
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:12,056
He was exiled over 300 years ago.

228
00:43:12,682 --> 00:43:14,183
Three hundred years?

229
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,144
What makes you think
we'll find him now?

230
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:17,979
I was the one who exiled him.

231
00:43:57,477 --> 00:43:59,103
Looks like a monastery.

232
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,356
It used to be.
More like a prison now.

233
00:44:01,981 --> 00:44:04,442
Tanis has been hiding there
since Viktor's order.

234
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:07,195
We'll be the first people
he's seen in centuries.

235
00:44:19,082 --> 00:44:21,167
- That's odd.
- What?

236
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:24,337
I don't remember this gate
being here before.

237
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:27,965
Take this.

238
00:45:33,322 --> 00:45:34,740
Shit.

239
00:45:58,347 --> 00:45:59,515
Go back!

240
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:03,186
Gotcha.

241
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:07,273
Fuck.

242
00:48:41,427 --> 00:48:43,596
I knew it was you, Selene.

243
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:47,350
The stench of Viktor's blood
still lingers in your veins.

244
00:48:47,516 --> 00:48:49,018
Tanis.

245
00:48:49,185 --> 00:48:50,936
I see your aim hasn't improved.

246
00:48:53,189 --> 00:48:55,399
You haven't changed.

247
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,318
You don't scare me, Selene.

248
00:48:58,361 --> 00:49:00,237
Well, we're gonna
have to work on that.

249
00:49:10,373 --> 00:49:11,749
We need to talk.

250
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:18,506
Your exile seems a bit more
comfortable than I remember.

251
00:49:19,382 --> 00:49:21,300
How does a Vampire
have Lycan bodyguards?

252
00:49:21,801 --> 00:49:22,927
A gift.

253
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,720
From a most persuasive client.

254
00:49:25,888 --> 00:49:27,264
Lucian.

255
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:30,559
Why would Lucian
wanna protect you?

256
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:33,771
Because he was trading with them.

257
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:37,942
UV rounds.

258
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:40,778
How long have you been
in the business of killing your own?

259
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:44,073
I've done what's necessary
to survive.

260
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,577
My decision was made easy the day
your precious Viktor betrayed me.

261
00:49:48,744 --> 00:49:51,580
Betrayal was something
he did very well.

262
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:55,668
Viktor's dead. I killed him.

263
00:49:55,835 --> 00:49:57,253
You?

264
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,213
Kill Viktor?

265
00:50:03,259 --> 00:50:05,261
No, I think not.

266
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,390
Oh, unless you've learned the truth.

267
00:50:14,729 --> 00:50:17,314
So your eyes are finally open.

268
00:50:18,065 --> 00:50:20,359
Isn't it interesting how the truth...

269
00:50:20,526 --> 00:50:22,903
...is even harder to absorb
than light?

270
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:25,281
You know, I tried to stop him,
of course.

271
00:50:25,448 --> 00:50:28,409
A travesty,
committing such a horrible crime.

272
00:50:29,452 --> 00:50:31,662
And then turning you.

273
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,956
That was too much to take.

274
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,500
My protests are why he put me here.

275
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,587
Careful with that, dear.

276
00:50:39,754 --> 00:50:40,963
Makes a terrible bang.

277
00:50:42,298 --> 00:50:43,841
Open the blades and they're active.

278
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,510
Good to know.

279
00:50:50,598 --> 00:50:53,100
Viktor put you here for a reason,
but I doubt it was...

280
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:55,603
...because you had moral qualms.

281
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:59,815
- What do you know?
- Very little of anything, I'm afraid.

282
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:09,408
Well, then, perhaps I'm mistaken
and there's no use for you at all.

283
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:12,787
Marcus was after this. Why?

284
00:51:57,498 --> 00:52:00,334
Some history is based on truth...

285
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:02,628
...and others on deception.

286
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:08,050
Viktor was not the first of our kind,
as you were led to believe.

287
00:52:08,217 --> 00:52:10,177
He was once human...

288
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:12,555
...the ruler of these lands.

289
00:52:14,056 --> 00:52:15,850
Marcus...

290
00:52:16,475 --> 00:52:18,394
...he's the one.

291
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:21,480
The source.

292
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:24,733
The first true Vampire.

293
00:52:25,234 --> 00:52:27,611
So the legend is true.

294
00:52:28,237 --> 00:52:31,574
Toward the end of his ruthless life...

295
00:52:32,575 --> 00:52:36,745
...when the next breath meant more
to Viktor than silver or gold...

296
00:52:36,912 --> 00:52:39,790
...Marcus came with an offer...

297
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:43,752
...a reprieve from sickness
and death.

298
00:52:44,712 --> 00:52:46,255
Immortality.

299
00:52:46,422 --> 00:52:50,009
And in return, Viktor was to use
his army-turned-immortal to help him.

300
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,678
To do what?

301
00:52:52,845 --> 00:52:55,097
To defeat
the very first Werewolves...

302
00:52:55,264 --> 00:52:58,309
...a dangerous
and infectious breed...

303
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,103
...created by Marcus' own
flesh and blood:

304
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:04,732
His twin brother, William.

305
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:08,402
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

306
00:53:08,736 --> 00:53:10,988
Disgusting though
your brethren may be...

307
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:13,157
...they at least are evolved.

308
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:15,618
No, these were raging monsters.

309
00:53:15,784 --> 00:53:19,121
Never able to take
human form again.

310
00:53:19,288 --> 00:53:22,458
It was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage.

311
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:26,378
And William's appetite for destruction
and rampage was insatiable.

312
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,089
He had to be stopped.

313
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:31,717
And so once Viktor's army
was turned...

314
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:34,303
...the legions of Vampires
under his control...

315
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:37,723
...tracked down
and destroyed the animals...

316
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,224
...then captured William...

317
00:53:39,808 --> 00:53:41,310
...and locked him away.

318
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,979
Viktor's prisoner for all time.

319
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:47,900
Why let him live?

320
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:52,363
For the very same reason that Viktor
never conspired against Marcus: Fear.

321
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,823
He was warned that,
should Marcus be killed...

322
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:58,327
...all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

323
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,330
So in Viktor's mind...

324
00:54:01,497 --> 00:54:04,249
...William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans...

325
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:05,542
...his slaves.

326
00:54:07,586 --> 00:54:09,046
Yes.

327
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:12,383
Yes, a clever deception...

328
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,344
...but one Viktor was hardly willing
to put to the test.

329
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:18,681
And so Marcus was protected...

330
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:21,100
...at all costs.

331
00:54:24,353 --> 00:54:25,604
Yes, here we are.

332
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,862
- Vampires?
- Mortals.

333
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:38,033
Men loyal to Alexander Corvinus.

334
00:54:39,868 --> 00:54:41,203
The father of us all.

335
00:54:49,211 --> 00:54:50,546
What's this?

336
00:54:54,383 --> 00:54:56,010
You should know.

337
00:54:57,219 --> 00:54:59,013
It's William's prison.

338
00:55:01,223 --> 00:55:04,977
The prison your father
was commissioned to build.

339
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:13,652
So you've been the one keeping
a watch over this for me, have you?

340
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:16,113
I've been searching everywhere
for this, my darling.

341
00:55:21,076 --> 00:55:22,327
What is it?

342
00:55:22,995 --> 00:55:24,246
What's wrong?

343
00:55:25,414 --> 00:55:28,292
She now understands
why her family was killed.

344
00:55:31,253 --> 00:55:33,630
But that was many years later.

345
00:55:34,923 --> 00:55:36,800
The winter of Lucian's escape.

346
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:39,011
Your father knew too much.

347
00:55:39,178 --> 00:55:40,971
Or too much for Viktor to risk...

348
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,265
...especially when Lucian...

349
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:47,561
...had the key to William's cell.

350
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:50,439
And I'm the map.

351
00:55:51,273 --> 00:55:52,816
Yes.

352
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:58,363
The only one still living
who has seen its location.

353
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:02,117
Oh, Viktor realized you'd be too young
to remember explicitly...

354
00:56:02,284 --> 00:56:05,537
...but Marcus knows
that the memory...

355
00:56:05,704 --> 00:56:09,374
...and therefore the exact location
of William's prison...

356
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,710
...is hidden away in your blood.

357
00:56:13,045 --> 00:56:15,422
Why is Marcus looking
for him now...

358
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:17,174
...after all this time?

359
00:56:17,549 --> 00:56:18,759
That I cannot answer.

360
00:56:29,978 --> 00:56:31,605
But I do know someone...

361
00:56:31,814 --> 00:56:34,650
...who could stop him.
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

362
00:56:36,235 --> 00:56:40,614
In exchange for your discretion,
of course.

363
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,367
Of course.

364
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,341
Tanis. You seem anxious.

365
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,344
Why do you flee
the very sight of me?

366
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:50,976
Please...

367
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,562
...sit.

368
00:57:54,897 --> 00:57:57,691
There's no need
for this to be unpleasant.

369
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:01,361
I've always rather enjoyed
your company.

370
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:09,453
Now you're being rude.

371
00:58:10,746 --> 00:58:12,247
Sorry.

372
00:58:20,422 --> 00:58:22,549
Viktor struck two keys.

373
00:58:23,091 --> 00:58:24,509
What do you know of them?

374
00:58:26,595 --> 00:58:28,180
Keys?

375
00:58:29,097 --> 00:58:32,059
I don't know of any keys.

376
00:58:47,616 --> 00:58:49,534
Oh, yes.

377
00:58:49,701 --> 00:58:51,245
Yes, those keys.

378
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,581
- Yes?
- Well, one was...

379
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:58,877
One was kept in plain sight...

380
00:58:59,044 --> 00:59:01,296
...draped around
his daughter's neck...

381
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,508
...right there for you to see.
- And the other?

382
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:10,180
- Kept with Viktor at all times.
- Where?

383
00:59:11,223 --> 00:59:12,975
Within him.

384
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:15,978
Beneath the flesh.

385
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,319
Please. Please.

386
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:25,654
I beg you. Please.

387
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,739
Please, I beg you.

388
00:59:44,298 --> 00:59:46,883
- Who could stop him.
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

389
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,553
Go to pier 17.
Ask for Lorenz Macaro.

390
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,204
How do we know Tanis
isn't setting us up?

391
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:18,832
He's not brave enough
to set me up.

392
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:45,984
You can go.

393
01:00:56,411 --> 01:00:58,121
You're familiar with this, then?

394
01:01:06,046 --> 01:01:07,339
Intimately.

395
01:01:14,596 --> 01:01:16,515
You're Alexander Corvinus.

396
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:26,149
There was a time
that I was known by that name.

397
01:01:27,526 --> 01:01:30,904
By any name,
I am still your forefather.

398
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:40,330
How have you stayed hidden
all these years?

399
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:42,916
For centuries I've stood by
and watched the havoc...

400
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:48,088
...my sons have wrought upon
each other and upon humanity.

401
01:01:49,297 --> 01:01:51,133
Not the legacy I prayed for...

402
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:53,593
...the morning I watched them
enter this world.

403
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:57,055
And a tiresome duty...

404
01:01:57,222 --> 01:02:00,434
...keeping the war contained,
cleaning up the mess...

405
01:02:01,435 --> 01:02:04,771
...hiding my family's
unfortunate history.

406
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:07,274
- Couldn't you have stopped it?
- Yes.

407
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:10,652
Could you kill your own sons?

408
01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:13,155
You know what Marcus will do.

409
01:02:13,321 --> 01:02:16,408
If he finds me,
he finds William's prison.

410
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,743
You need to help us stop him.

411
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:23,915
You are asking me
to help you kill my son?

412
01:02:24,082 --> 01:02:25,500
You?

413
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:27,169
A Death Dealer?

414
01:02:27,502 --> 01:02:29,337
How many innocents did you kill...

415
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:32,299
...in the six-century quest
to avenge your family?

416
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:34,843
Spare me
your self-righteous declarations.

417
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:40,098
You are no different from Marcus
and even less noble than William.

418
01:02:40,265 --> 01:02:43,018
At least he cannot control
his savagery.

419
01:02:43,185 --> 01:02:46,313
Anything I've done
can be laid at your feet.

420
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,608
Hundreds of thousands have died
because of your inability to accept...

421
01:02:49,774 --> 01:02:52,819
...that your sons are monsters,
that they create monsters.

422
01:02:53,653 --> 01:02:55,155
You could've stopped all of this.

423
01:02:55,322 --> 01:02:57,073
Do not come groveling to me...

424
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,952
...simply because you are weaker
than your adversary.

425
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,997
You know the devastation William
caused before he was captured.

426
01:03:04,164 --> 01:03:05,540
He cannot be set free.

427
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,925
Wa- No, wait.
You're no match for him.

428
01:04:19,781 --> 01:04:21,032
Soon, brother.

429
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:57,360
No.

430
01:05:09,247 --> 01:05:10,749
Father.

431
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:12,250
No.

432
01:05:13,668 --> 01:05:16,212
They've gone.
There, there, my child.

433
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:17,881
You are safe now.

434
01:06:06,554 --> 01:06:09,057
No. Michael.

435
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:11,059
Look at me.

436
01:06:13,311 --> 01:06:14,896
Michael.

437
01:06:15,397 --> 01:06:16,648
Shit.

438
01:06:42,549 --> 01:06:44,300
Please.

439
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,971
Please.

440
01:06:56,938 --> 01:06:58,523
Come on.

441
01:06:59,023 --> 01:07:00,734
Come on.

442
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:06,281
Fuck.

443
01:07:52,494 --> 01:07:53,828
Hello, Father.

444
01:07:54,412 --> 01:07:57,457
You are unwelcome in my presence.

445
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:04,214
The predictable heart
that never thaws.

446
01:08:04,839 --> 01:08:08,134
Pity it beats within such a fool.

447
01:08:09,093 --> 01:08:10,887
The eldest of the immortals...

448
01:08:11,346 --> 01:08:15,308
...yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny.

449
01:08:15,475 --> 01:08:20,855
We are oddities of nature, you and I.
Nothing more.

450
01:08:21,022 --> 01:08:23,608
This is a world for humanity.

451
01:08:23,775 --> 01:08:27,946
And that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons?

452
01:08:28,112 --> 01:08:30,615
Why you stood by
for over half a millennium...

453
01:08:30,782 --> 01:08:34,369
...as William suffered alone
in darkness?

454
01:08:34,869 --> 01:08:36,871
No, Father.

455
01:08:37,497 --> 01:08:40,875
I have no respect
for your petty sentiment.

456
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:45,588
Viktor's key. Where is it?

457
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:48,550
Whatever plan you have
for William is futile.

458
01:08:48,716 --> 01:08:51,886
- You cannot control your brother.
- Oh, I am stronger now.

459
01:08:52,053 --> 01:08:55,473
And our bond is greater than you
have ever wanted to acknowledge.

460
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,975
You're wrong.

461
01:08:57,141 --> 01:09:00,395
Soon you'll be drowning in Lycans,
just like before.

462
01:09:00,562 --> 01:09:02,230
Oh, not Lycans, Father...

463
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,524
...or Vampires.

464
01:09:04,691 --> 01:09:09,237
A new race, created in
the image of their maker...

465
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,948
...their new god:

466
01:09:14,909 --> 01:09:16,911
Me.

467
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:31,301
And a true god...

468
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:37,640
...has no father.

469
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,637
You will fail.

470
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:53,216
- Get the kit.
- No.

471
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:03,851
Please, sir, let us help you.

472
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,354
The time has come, my friend.

473
01:11:07,939 --> 01:11:09,482
Find the girl.

474
01:11:10,858 --> 01:11:12,986
Bring her to me.

475
01:11:18,449 --> 01:11:19,784
No, wait. Wait.

476
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:26,582
If you want Marcus,
you'll need Alexander's help.

477
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,382
Don't leave him here.

478
01:11:55,028 --> 01:11:58,740
- Did he get the pendant?
- Yes.

479
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:02,160
He's too powerful for you alone.

480
01:12:02,702 --> 01:12:04,787
You are the only one
older than he is...

481
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:06,956
...the only one stronger.

482
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:09,542
You could have killed him yourself.

483
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:13,755
No matter what he's become...

484
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:16,549
...he is my son.

485
01:12:22,847 --> 01:12:25,641
You are the last hope left.

486
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:29,896
There is only one way
to defeat him.

487
01:12:37,195 --> 01:12:39,280
Quickly, now...

488
01:12:39,447 --> 01:12:43,451
...before there is no more legacy
left in my veins.

489
01:12:51,959 --> 01:12:54,128
What will I become?

490
01:12:55,922 --> 01:12:57,590
The future.

491
01:13:40,258 --> 01:13:42,218
Go now.

492
01:17:29,737 --> 01:17:31,238
We're getting close.

493
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,712
Head back around
towards the river.

494
01:18:40,724 --> 01:18:42,852
I don't see a way inside.

495
01:18:45,104 --> 01:18:47,356
There used to be
a river entrance just there.

496
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:49,608
It must be submerged now.

497
01:18:49,775 --> 01:18:51,277
Looks like we're getting wet.

498
01:19:27,605 --> 01:19:29,190
Closer.

499
01:19:34,778 --> 01:19:36,363
Selene.

500
01:20:49,562 --> 01:20:50,896
William.

501
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:07,913
Wait.

502
01:21:12,918 --> 01:21:14,420
No, William. Stop.

503
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,547
Be still, brother.

504
01:21:16,714 --> 01:21:18,215
It's me.

505
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:24,555
I'd no sooner harm you than myself.

506
01:21:57,004 --> 01:21:58,255
Which way?

507
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,035
Is this it?

508
01:22:32,289 --> 01:22:34,208
He's already here.

509
01:23:07,991 --> 01:23:09,743
What is that?

510
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:13,163
Nothing. Let's go.

511
01:23:24,216 --> 01:23:26,385
We're too late.

512
01:23:53,954 --> 01:23:55,581
- After him.
- Get behind him.

513
01:24:04,965 --> 01:24:06,633
Impressive.

514
01:25:15,536 --> 01:25:17,037
Michael, you're unique.

515
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:22,209
There's never been
a hybrid before.

516
01:25:23,293 --> 01:25:25,087
Your powers could be limitless.

517
01:25:42,521 --> 01:25:44,773
Hold it! Oh, fuck.

518
01:25:48,485 --> 01:25:51,280
- Where is he?
- He went right through there.

519
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:55,742
All we have are UV rounds.
They won't take him down.

520
01:25:55,909 --> 01:25:58,412
No, but they'll slow him down.

521
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:46,335
Let's go.

522
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,086
You all right?

523
01:28:04,955 --> 01:28:06,707
Jesus Christ!

524
01:29:58,652 --> 01:30:00,237
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

525
01:30:00,403 --> 01:30:01,780
No, these were raging monsters.

526
01:30:01,947 --> 01:30:04,116
Unable to take human form
ever again.

527
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:56,459
What are you waiting for?
Shoot them.

528
01:30:56,626 --> 01:30:59,379
I can't. Not without taking her out.

529
01:30:59,546 --> 01:31:00,755
I can't get a shot.

530
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:53,767
Michael.

531
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:32,138
Take her down.

532
01:33:04,379 --> 01:33:05,380
Cut us loose!

533
01:33:09,134 --> 01:33:10,844
We're going down!

534
01:34:50,443 --> 01:34:51,903
William!

535
01:35:02,497 --> 01:35:06,459
I knew Viktor made a mistake
by keeping you as a pet.

536
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,338
He should have killed you
with the rest of your family.

537
01:37:58,673 --> 01:38:01,801
An unknown chapter lies ahead.

538
01:38:01,968 --> 01:38:05,263
The lines that had divided the clans
have now been blurred.

539
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:08,391
Chaos and infighting are inevitable.

540
01:38:08,558 --> 01:38:12,145
All that is certain is that darkness
is still ahead.

541
01:38:12,312 --> 01:38:16,107
But for now, for the first time...

542
01:38:16,274 --> 01:38:19,152
...I look into the light with new hope.
