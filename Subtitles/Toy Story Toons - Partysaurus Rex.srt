00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:15,804
Go! Go! Go! Go!

3
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:18,098
Look out! You'll get soap on the floor!

4
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,894
Rex, you burst my bubble!

5
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:24,229
- What a buzzkill.
-Sorry, I didn't...

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,148
You're what they call a party pooper!

7
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:27,524
Party Pooper Rex!

8
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:31,069
- Party Pooper Rex!
-Party Pooper Rex!

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,821
Bonnie! Bath time!

10
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:34,156
Can I bring a toy?

11
00:00:34,157 --> 00:00:35,657
I ain't no bath toy.

12
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:40,658
Bath time!
Rex will be perfect for the search party.

13
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:48,708
Cap'n's log. Received a distress
signal, but no sign of...

14
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,507
Survivors! Son, squeak to me!

15
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:53,425
Save yourself!

16
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:57,846
What?

17
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:02,847
No!

18
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,105
Fire torpedoes!

19
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:11,026
No! I just want to have tea with you!

20
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:15,864
Okay, trouble.
There's way too much water in here.

21
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:17,282
You want to flood the house?

22
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:18,367
Yeah!

23
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:21,036
Well, how about
dinner at Grandma's instead?

24
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:23,413
Grandma's!
-Sure.

25
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:24,706
Welcome aboard!

26
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:28,460
Yeah, baby! You were way
scarier than the last sea monster!

27
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:29,670
No offense, Cuddles.

28
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:30,963
No problem.

29
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:34,132
What do they call you, sailor?

30
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:36,635
Well, my friends call me...

31
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:40,097
<i>Party Pooper Rex!</i>

32
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:42,558
Partysaurus Rex!

33
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,684
Avast there!

34
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,477
You're in the right place, baby!

35
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:48,772
Because when the water's high,
the party's fly.

36
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:53,773
AYQ. aye!

37
00:01:56,614 --> 00:01:57,656
My lobster!

38
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:59,533
Till tomorrow, my love.

39
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:02,494
And when bath time's done?

40
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,580
There's no more fun.

41
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,331
We need water to move.

42
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:08,625
Bath time's only 15 minutes a day!

43
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:11,837
We could party all the time
if we could turn the water on ourselves.

44
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:15,340
Aye, Drips. But no one's got arms here,
except for Barbara.

45
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:17,175
How we doing, Babs?

46
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:21,305
Weeks, months.
Scrubbing's been light, Cap'n.

47
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:25,475
Oh, man! I wish we could
get the party started up in here.

48
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:28,020
No more tears!

49
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:30,647
Well, I've got arms.

50
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:34,192
I could get this party started up in here.

51
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:35,277
Without Bonnie?

52
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:39,031
topside?

53
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:41,408
Shiver me timbers!

54
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:44,703
No way! Yeah, Rex! That's it, baby!

55
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,788
Let's pump this party!

56
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:51,789
Partysaurus, you rock!

57
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:53,670
AYel aye. matey!

58
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,130
Check me out! Oh, yeah!

59
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:58,050
A thank ye to Rex!

60
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:01,219
Wow!

61
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,721
- Thanks!
-Rex, baby!

62
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:03,972
How about a little more bubbly?

63
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:05,098
More? No, no, no, no!

64
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,559
<i>Part)' POoper!</i>

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,397
I mean, why have a little
when you could have a lot?

66
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:14,900
We really got a party up in here!

67
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,777
Pa rtysaurus.

68
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:18,070
Can you get some of us in?

69
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:19,529
Are you crazy? There's...

70
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,365
<i>POOPer!</i>

71
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:26,366
Some of you? Why not all of you!

72
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:42,260
Yeah, baby!

73
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:47,261
All hands on deck!

74
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,230
My lobster!

75
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:56,733
What's that racket?

76
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:59,695
- What?
-The overflow drain?

77
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:02,781
- No problem!
-Hey, whoa.

78
00:04:02,782 --> 00:04:06,243
Whoa, this dude really knows
how to party. Seriously...

79
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:08,161
He blocked the drain.

80
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:10,789
We will overflow!

81
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,124
Awesome!

82
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,042
Thanks, Partysaurus!

83
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:19,043
Partysaurus doesn't worry about too
much soap and the tub overflow...

84
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:22,718
Overflow? We'll flood the house!

85
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:27,719
We're crossing the scum line!

86
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,476
Too much water, everybody.

87
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:33,687
The floaters have all the fun!

88
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:35,814
What up, fishes? What what!

89
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:37,816
- He turned it up!
-Avast!

90
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:40,318
No! Too much water!

91
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,486
Help!

92
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:43,155
Sir, this party is out of control.

93
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,197
I know! There's too much...

94
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:49,198
Out of control!

95
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:53,749
Man!

96
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,376
You've got to be kidding me.

97
00:04:56,377 --> 00:05:01,377
That was close.

98
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:05,844
It's a perfect storm!

99
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:09,681
AYQ. aye!

100
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:14,682
What are you doing?
My tail! No, not the...

101
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:19,107
Overflow! Overflow!

102
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:22,068
All hail the Partysaurus Rex!

103
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,572
We're going to overflow!

104
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:28,700
We're going over the top, baby!

105
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:32,579
Secure the rigging!

106
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,414
Man overboard!

107
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:36,208
Yeah, it's been a while.

108
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:41,209
Rex? Are you okay in...

109
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:49,179
You guys missed it.
I was a partysaurus!

110
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,599
Party? You? I'll believe it when I see it.

111
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,518
L-yah, Partysaurus!

112
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,645
We heard what you did
for the bath toys.

113
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:58,688
Can you hook us up, mon?

114
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:03,689
Rex! Rex! Rex!

115
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:07,197
Duty calls!

116
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:12,198
Yeah, mon!

117
00:06:13,305 --> 00:07:13,675
