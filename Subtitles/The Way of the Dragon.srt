2
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Attention please.

3
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,555
TWA flight number
820 from Hong Kong

4
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,807
has landed one half
hour ahead of schedule.

5
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,686
Passengers are
deplaning at Gate 3.

6
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,478
Announcing the departure

7
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,148
of Pan Am flight number
538 leaving for New York.

8
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,734
Passengers please
proceed to gate 4.

9
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,278
Thank you.

10
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,340
Japan Airlines flight number 18

11
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,300
has just arrived at gate 20.

12
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,970
Thank you.

13
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,195
Mommy!

14
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,170
Go right on in!

15
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,882
May I help you?

16
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,971
Eggs.

17
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,022
Eggs.

18
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,064
There.

19
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:30,742
Announcing the arrival of
BEA flight number 704.

20
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,368
Thank you.

21
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,079
Waiter?

22
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,193
Tang Lung?

23
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,569
Miss Chen Ching Hua?

24
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,196
Yes.

25
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,450
Why not waiting for me at the
exit gate but running around?

26
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,785
The plane arrived early.

27
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:59,163
I was hungry so I went
and grabbed a bite.

28
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,207
How is my uncle in Hong Kong?

29
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,460
He's a bit unwell,
so I came instead.

30
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:09,465
He wrote me about you but
didn't go into details.

31
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,466
How can you help me?

32
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:16,014
Please don't stand on ceremony.
I'll personally help you.

33
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,392
Personally help me?

34
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,186
You know my problem?

35
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,479
That you must tell
me in details later.

36
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,192
But first, now please tell
me where the toilet is?

37
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,442
Precious horse (BMW)?

38
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,453
Wild horse (Mustang)?

39
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,542
A flying horse?

40
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,476
Dad died last month and
left me this restaurant.

41
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,313
Uncle Wang and the others
have helped out a lot.

42
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,565
Business wasn't bad
in the beginning.

43
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,361
Then a huge syndicate
stepped in.

44
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,904
They're interested in our land

45
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,490
and wanted me to
sell the restaurant.

46
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,409
There's no sale without
mutual agreement.

47
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,537
If you refuse, what can they do?

48
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:07,876
In theory, you're right, but
they won't listen to reason.

49
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:13,589
They'll do anything
for getting my land.

50
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:19,136
They hired some young thugs to
watch the place day and night.

51
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:24,017
If a customer comes in they
simply drive him away.

52
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,811
What am I to do?

53
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,092
Why not report it to the police?

54
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:32,036
They disappear when
the police come.

55
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,737
We can't ask the police for
round-the-clock protection.

56
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:44,705
Business has gone down badly and
I still have to pay my workers.

57
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,750
How can I go on
meeting the expenses?

58
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:59,177
The thugs have become worse lately
demanding an immediate answer.

59
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,638
So I wrote to my uncle for help.

60
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,641
I thought he'd send
a lawyer, but...

61
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,643
You are welcome.

62
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,645
I told you not to worry.
I am here to help.

63
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,855
Don't worry, Miss Chen.

64
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,775
It's nothing, I can
take care of them.

65
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:17,862
Look up there!

66
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,781
That's their headquarters.

67
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:57,902
Please sit down.

68
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,351
I rent this place.

69
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,102
It's more convenient living here

70
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,938
because all the men
live at the restaurant.

71
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,940
There's always a spare room.

72
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,941
If any of the workers get
sick, they can come here.

73
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,945
It is crowded in the restaurant.

74
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,864
You can stay here
for the time being.

75
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,868
You're my uncle's friend,
so please feel at home.

76
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,871
Let me know if you
need anything.

77
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,458
May I use your toilet?

78
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,043
It's over there.

79
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,382
Chinese New Year is coming up.

80
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,848
Everyone in Hong Kong is
happy and celebrating.

81
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,171
Do they celebrate it in Rome?

82
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,177
I haven't been back to Hong
Kong for more than 1 O years.

83
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:59,953
I think it's changed a lot.

84
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,943
I may be a stranger
when I am back.

85
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:03,945
Oh, yes.

86
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,032
How's the restaurant
business there now?

87
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,233
I live in the New Territories
and seldom go out of town.

88
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:16,958
I practice martial
arts every day.

89
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,965
Restaurants haven't
changed much.

90
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,052
Take a seat.

91
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,976
Here's the key.

92
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,689
Our telephone number and
address are all on it.

93
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,076
The restaurant is nearby.

94
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,912
If you get lost just show
that card to a taxi driver

95
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,914
and any taxi driver
will bring you back.

96
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,918
Taxi? It's too expensive here.

97
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,211
Are there public light buses?

98
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,337
Do you need some money?

99
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,091
No, I brought some with me.

100
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:11,096
Better put it in a bank,
it's safer that way.

101
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,098
No, it's safer to
carry it by myself.

102
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,017
Much safer than
carry it by others.

103
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,020
I won't argue. How
much did you bring?

104
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,606
Not much.

105
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,110
Really, not much.

106
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,738
I still say it's
safer in the bank.

107
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,115
Come on!

108
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,166
Miss Chen! How are you?

109
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,292
This is Mr. Tang.

110
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,211
He wants to deposit some money.

111
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,380
Ah, my friend!

112
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,176
How much do you have?
Take it out now.

113
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,803
This way.

114
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,395
How much you want to
change into our currency?

115
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,689
How much local money
will you change?

116
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,442
Only $20.

117
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,404
Lately the exchange
rate has been bad.

118
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,785
There $20 will do.

119
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,390
That was the bank manager
not a pickpocket.

120
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,725
You must be more polite.

121
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,645
Not everyone you
meet is a villain.

122
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,917
Not everyone you meet
is a pickpocket.

123
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:27,301
Besides, I know
that bank manager.

124
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,238
Foreigners are warm and passionate.
They also quite friendly.

125
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,157
When people smile, smile back.

126
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,159
That's politeness.

127
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,289
When someone puts an
arm on your shoulder

128
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,291
it's a sign of friendship.

129
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,211
You should react the same way.

130
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,011
Remember my words and no
need to be so uptight!

131
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,790
Sit down.

132
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,549
Make yourself at home.

133
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,872
Ah Lung.

134
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:52,876
You must be Ah Lung!
Welcome to Rome.

135
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:57,881
I'm Ah Kun from Miss
Chen's restaurant.

136
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:58,883
Brother Kun!

137
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,512
Miss Chen has returned to the
restaurant after a long wait.

138
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,753
She asked me to take you there.

139
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,892
By the way, where
were you just now?

140
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,189
Let's g0!

141
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,966
Uncle Wang, Ah Lung is coming.

142
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,927
Ah Lung, this is Uncle Wang.

143
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,679
Uncle Wang.

144
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,975
Have a seat!

145
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,938
- Ah Kun, make some tea.
- OK.

146
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,946
It must have been a long
and tedious flight.

147
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:10,914
How do you like it here so far?

148
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm certainly not
used to things yet.

149
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,172
Doesn't matter, you
will, as time goes on.

150
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:26,971
It's been a long time
since I was back home.

151
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,017
How are things in Hong Kong?

152
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:37,439
Hong Kong? I live in
the New Territories

153
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,984
and I seldom go out of town.

154
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,740
Have some tea.

155
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,619
Come, have some tea.

156
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,006
Why there is no customer coming
to such a big restaurant?

157
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:06,134
Ah Lung, with those
thugs around,

158
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:10,223
who'd dare come here?

159
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:15,019
Ah Lung, there are more
workers training out back.

160
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:18,022
Let's go meet them.

161
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:31,035
There's no business so they
spend their time exercising.

162
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,121
Come on!

163
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,129
Before Mr. Chen passed
away, they learned karate

164
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,131
to handle the villains.

165
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,757
Why didn't you take it up?

166
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,344
I'm not interested in
foreign martial arts.

167
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:52,598
It doesn't matter what style

168
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,279
if you can use your
body well without limit

169
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:59,062
even in the midst
of violent movement

170
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,065
to honestly express oneself.

171
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,153
I prefer Chinese boxing.

172
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,155
Do you know Chinese boxing?

173
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,156
Yes!

174
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:10,574
Really?

175
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,622
Let's take a breather.

176
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,918
Come here.

177
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,720
This is Tang Lung.
Introduce yourselves.

178
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,181
My name is Tony!

179
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,557
Jimmy!

180
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:36,933
Thomas!

181
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,018
Robert!

182
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,519
I've no English name.
Call me Ah Quan.

183
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,980
Brother Quan.

184
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:47,862
<i>Come on...</i>

185
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,534
He looks like a coach.

186
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,120
Have you learned any boxing?

187
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,415
Ah Lung came from
Hong Kong to help us.

188
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,543
He's an Chinese boxing expert.

189
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,587
I'm just a novice.

190
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:10,425
Chinese boxing? I understand
it's like dancing.

191
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,594
But it sadly lacks power?

192
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:15,431
You lack power when you haven't
mastered the fundamentals.

193
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:25,232
Right, how then do
you develop power?

194
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:29,445
By uniting the waist
with the stance.

195
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:36,577
Will you demonstrate how to unite
the waist with the stance?

196
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,991
I'm afraid I'll hurt someone.

197
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,875
What are you afraid of?

198
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,797
They're wearing
protective padding.

199
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,800
They won't get hurt.

200
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,285
We've guests coming.

201
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,621
Change the clothes
and get to work.

202
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,290
Hurry!

203
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,293
Come on, let's go.

204
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,924
Change the clothes
and get cracking!

205
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,052
Brother Kun, where's the toilet?

206
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:40,433
Over there. It's
labeled in English.

207
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,308
Get the hell out of here.

208
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,559
Now.

209
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,187
Come on!

210
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,620
Get out!

211
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,831
Why?

212
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:46,623
That's why!

213
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,128
What's your decision?

214
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:52,547
Uncle Wang!

215
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:57,176
Come quick, they're here again!

216
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:58,635
Stop it!

217
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,637
All right!

218
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:05,642
If you don't send
a reply tonight,

219
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,353
don't blame us for
getting rough.

220
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:17,654
Please help us out, Mr. Ho,
put in a good word for us.

221
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,575
Give us a few more
days to think it over.

222
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:27,415
You've been delaying
a long time.

223
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,543
Are you not selling?

224
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:32,669
Why do you fight?

225
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,754
You fight.

226
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:38,050
Don't fight please! We'll
only wreck our own things.

227
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:43,597
Remember, you must
send a reply tonight.

228
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:44,598
Let's g0!

229
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:50,688
Sorry!

230
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,614
Be careful next time.

231
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:04,327
You don't even know
a word of English.

232
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,079
Why did my uncle send you here?

233
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,340
Ah Lung, they're young
and headstrong.

234
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,218
Don't blame them, everything
will be all right.

235
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,277
Lucky that they
weren't armed today.

236
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,404
In broad daylight?

237
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,741
They wouldn't dare
use a gun in public.

238
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,409
If Uncle Wang hadn't
stopped them,

239
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,373
I'd have used karate on them!

240
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,416
You can talk!

241
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,336
What good is your karate?

242
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:01,258
It's still better
than Chinese boxing.

243
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,387
People shove you out of the way.

244
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,306
And you even apologized!

245
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,985
Sit down, please!

246
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,154
Sit down, please!

247
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,709
May I help you?

248
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,586
May you help me?

249
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,588
Sure!

250
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:45,301
I'd like some Chinese spareribs.

251
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,470
Chinese spareribs?

252
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:51,725
You mean to tell me

253
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:55,229
you don't know what
Chinese spareribs are?

254
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,524
Well, let me show you!

255
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,244
What are you doing?

256
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:15,166
You know what we are
doing, don't they, fellas?

257
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,170
You all should have
left this restaurant!

258
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:22,014
Brother Kun, get Uncle
Wang out here to help.

259
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:23,038
You two come to help.

260
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:32,183
Stay calm. Don't
wreck our place.

261
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,518
It's no use.

262
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,774
You want to step outside?

263
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,274
Sure!

264
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:42,275
Good!

265
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,205
Ah Lung, you?

266
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,282
Jimmy! Jimmy.

267
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,284
Jimmy!

268
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,495
Chinese boxing?

269
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,667
Damn! They know nothing!

270
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,211
They think this is
Chinese boxing.

271
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,590
If I knew Chinese boxing, I'd
give them a good taste of it!

272
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,424
I'll go!

273
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:02,314
Tell him this is Chinese boxing.

274
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,319
Hey! Chinese boxer!

275
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,679
The Gold Dragon Fist No.4.

276
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,724
"Little Dragon Asking
for Direction."

277
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,353
"Big Dragon whipping its tail!"

278
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,407
Ah Lung, bravo!

279
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,533
Magnificent!

280
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,534
Excellent!

281
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,412
Don't be overjoyed.

282
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:45,251
There'll be more
trouble after this.

283
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:49,545
With Ah Lung's skills,

284
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,048
those men dare not
think twice now.

285
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:56,135
You don't understand.

286
00:34:56,136 --> 00:35:02,141
Powerful outsiders can hardly
afford to neglect local bullies.

287
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:07,146
This is their territory.

288
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,817
We are under their control.

289
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,861
We must be careful.

290
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,449
Let's be more patient.

291
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:19,868
More patience! Man,
our Dragon is here!

292
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:23,997
You'd be wise to heed my advice.

293
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:25,791
Is that so?

294
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,502
Calm down, everyone.

295
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:33,006
Ah Lung, it's late,
you must be tired.

296
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,467
Let's turn in.

297
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:51,775
Want some supper?

298
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,028
No, I must get up
early for training.

299
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,322
Go to bed early.

300
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,034
I hear it's easy
to buy a gun here?

301
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:03,912
Yes, any local citizen
can get a license.

302
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:24,932
What are you doing?

303
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,059
Making darts.

304
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,060
Darts?

305
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,946
What is it?

306
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,074
What to do?

307
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:42,075
Want to eat?

308
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:46,788
You can eat if you're
as good as Ah Lung.

309
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,833
Better go practice your karate!

310
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,962
Is it for Brother Lung? Why
didn't you say so earlier?

311
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:56,965
Brother Lung?

312
00:36:58,967 --> 00:36:59,968
<i>Brother Lung...</i>

313
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,976
Good morning, Brother Lung!

314
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:12,356
Good morning, Brother Lung!

315
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:17,986
Brother Lung, I made
this especially for you.

316
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:21,114
Eat it while it's hot.

317
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,121
Your kung fu is terrific.

318
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:29,998
Who was your teacher
in Hong Kong?

319
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,006
Look at this! "Little Dragon
Asking for Direction."

320
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,801
"Big Dragon whipping its tail."

321
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:42,886
With that, all the
enemies are down!

322
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:49,142
You said Chinese
boxing lacks power.

323
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:52,020
I was only kidding.

324
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:55,148
Brother Lung, you were
too fast yesterday.

325
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,150
We couldn't see clearly.

326
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:58,902
Will you show us again?

327
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,953
Please show us.

328
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:13,041
Go on then!

329
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,961
OK, come on.

330
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,177
Brother Lung, come on.

331
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:33,020
Everyone says you're
fast and powerful.

332
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:34,938
I didn't see it last night.

333
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,899
You said power can be generated

334
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,194
by uniting the waist
with the stance.

335
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,989
How about a demonstration?

336
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,616
Be quiet and let's watch, okay?

337
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,075
Let's watch together.

338
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,076
So, shut up!

339
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,077
Step back!

340
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:33,080
Are you all right?

341
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,124
Everything all right?

342
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,549
Fantastic!

343
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,009
Brother Lung, will
you be my teacher?

344
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,012
Will you be my teacher?

345
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,014
You said practicing
martial arts is useless.

346
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,017
So why are you doing it now?

347
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,019
I never liked karate.

348
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,023
But this is Chinese boxing.
Can you dig it?

349
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,026
We'll give up karate.

350
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,028
Let's learn from Brother Lung.

351
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,072
Right!

352
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,035
Customers! Come quick!

353
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,037
Corning...

354
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,047
Change your clothes!

355
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,091
Brother Lung, oh no, my teacher.

356
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,968
I am going to take
care of the customers.

357
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:32,055
We'll talk later.

358
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,061
Miss Chen, is there
anything for me to do?

359
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,064
Watch out for those villains.
They may come again.

360
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,089
My boss wants to see you!

361
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,091
What did he say?

362
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,760
He wants us to see his boss.

363
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:13,597
Shut up! Now move!

364
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,250
See you tomorrow.

365
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,970
All of you are good for nothing!

366
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:03,980
You! Didn't you have a gun?

367
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,859
What <i>I</i> like, I get,

368
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,361
and I want that restaurant.

369
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,070
<i>Yes, boss! Yes, boss!</i>

370
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,699
<i>Yes, boss! Yes, boss!</i>

371
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,410
Haven't you wasted enough time?

372
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:20,914
But I always do my best.

373
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:25,084
Then how come you failed?

374
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:32,174
I found out that they are helped
by a man called Tang Lung.

375
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,469
A man? Only one man?

376
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:41,142
But this man knows
Chinese kung fu.

377
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:42,269
<i>Kung m?</i>

378
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:37,866
Good morning, sit down.

379
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,245
Eat please.

380
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:49,252
It's hard to find this in
Rome how does it taste?

381
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,536
It's not as good
as in Hong Kong.

382
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,885
I cooked it.

383
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,513
It's all right.

384
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,610
And you?

385
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,404
Want some more?

386
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,497
I'll take you around Rome later.

387
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:41,555
Wait!

388
00:44:50,564 --> 00:44:51,565
Go on!

389
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,579
Move, move, come on!

390
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,585
Where's the man from Hong Kong?

391
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,378
Tell him to come out.

392
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:31,563
Where is he? Talk!

393
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,647
I don't know.

394
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,198
You'd better talk!

395
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,704
All right. He'll be back soon.

396
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:51,458
Where is he now?

397
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:04,262
These are Rome's famous
relics of the past.

398
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:12,646
Over there it is... what is it?

399
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,107
Our slum is full
of these wrecks.

400
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,488
Please.

401
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,764
This garden...

402
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:51,476
A king built the
garden for his queen.

403
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:54,770
It took a lot of time and money.

404
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:57,315
They must have been
really in love.

405
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,445
Are you married?

406
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,457
How do you like the palace?

407
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,713
Such a big place is a waste.

408
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:25,719
In Hong Kong, I would build a
skyscraper and collect rent.

409
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,725
We'd better return
to the restaurant.

410
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,737
Close the door.

411
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,831
You better cool it, baby.

412
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,250
Bring him down!

413
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,644
Chinese kung fu?

414
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:26,862
The boss means well.

415
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:29,239
We all come out for a living.

416
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,866
He appreciates talent

417
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:35,371
and he knows you're strong.
Oh, what rippling muscle!

418
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:37,540
We don't want to harm you.

419
00:48:39,793 --> 00:48:42,796
Here's a ticket
back to Hong Kong.

420
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:45,799
Better to stay out of trouble.

421
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,885
All right! Take him out,

422
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:51,887
but be careful with
the gun in public.

423
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:54,557
Yes, boss. Come on, let's go.

424
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,828
Go see if anybody's around.

425
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,794
Put your hands down.

426
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,673
Put your hands down!

427
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:10,633
Listen! Listen! Boss,
that bastard got away!

428
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:12,719
Go! Get him, but no gun!

429
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:23,979
Get him!

430
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:25,981
Let's get him!

431
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,494
Get him!

432
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,716
Let me get him.

433
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:11,796
Get him.

434
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:46,789
Get him!

435
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,517
Mama mia!

436
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:53,981
No need to like this.

437
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,864
Miss Chen, quit
while you're ahead.

438
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,200
You'd better say yes.

439
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,369
We intended well.

440
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,832
We're offering you a good deal.

441
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,583
What do you think?

442
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,876
Hello!

443
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:49,911
Tell him.

444
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:57,170
We don't want any more trouble,
or else I will retaliate.

445
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:04,927
He told us not to come and
cause any more trouble.

446
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,940
Move them out.

447
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:22,236
Hurry up and pick up everybody.

448
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:48,513
Ah Lung, hold it,
those are customers.

449
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,307
Welcome!

450
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,687
Come in please.

451
00:55:58,731 --> 00:55:59,731
Welcome!

452
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:07,031
Serve our guest properly.

453
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,993
Tang Lung must leave
Rome before 12pm,

454
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:14,205
otherwise a gunman for him.

455
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:19,835
See? I told you to be patient.

456
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,090
You should bear the
responsibility for this.

457
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:26,925
What should we do now?

458
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,719
We'll fight to the end.

459
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:33,932
This is no joke.

460
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:35,851
I know, but...

461
00:56:36,936 --> 00:56:38,771
I know how you feel,

462
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:44,860
but we must think of Ah Lung.

463
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:48,947
They'll do what they say.

464
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:50,282
<i>You mean...</i>

465
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:52,951
Keep him under cover for awhile.

466
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:57,330
Tomorrow is Lunar New Year's Day.
If there's trouble then...

467
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,456
I don't know if he'll agree?

468
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:04,296
I know he's stubborn.
You must persuade him.

469
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:08,300
Without him, we'll be forced
to sell the restaurant.

470
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:13,722
We'll have to see.

471
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:18,310
We may have to cooperate.

472
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:24,316
But we mustn't sell the place.

473
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:26,776
Let me decide.

474
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:28,778
All right.

475
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,198
Better go and talk to Ah Lung.

476
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,341
Is your restaurant
open tomorrow?

477
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:51,593
Good.

478
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:56,015
We'll go to the
countryside and practice.

479
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:16,369
Remind Ah Kun to bring
the protective padding.

480
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:25,961
Firecrackers?

481
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:32,426
It's banned in Hong Kong. There
must be Chinese living nearby.

482
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:46,399
You must leave Rome for awhile.

483
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,650
Leave Rome?

484
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:52,570
Don't misunderstand. We
don't want you to go.

485
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,198
Especially me, but
you must leave.

486
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,409
Do you understand me?

487
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,661
I don't understand.

488
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,502
Ah Lung, why won't you...

489
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,463
Are you afraid of fire crackers?

490
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,257
I'll take you to the airport.

491
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:14,885
- Why?
- Those men want you...

492
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:22,684
My duty is to help you.

493
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,603
I know, but you must leave.

494
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:39,242
They intend to kill you!

495
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,203
Kill me? Who?

496
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:53,090
Time's up. Let's go!

497
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,219
It's too noisy. I'll
close the window.

498
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:07,557
Stay here, don't move about.

499
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:00,593
Miss Chen!

500
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,638
Miss Chen!

501
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,312
Hello! May I help you?

502
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:16,316
Hello? Hello? Hello?

503
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:18,402
Hello?

504
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:26,242
Three five.

505
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:31,039
Hello, what was that Sir,
can you please repeat that?

506
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,584
Hello? Hello? Hello?

507
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:49,058
Miss Chen, don't waste time.

508
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:52,393
Here's the agreement of sale.

509
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,938
Sign it.

510
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:55,146
No!

511
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,149
Why be so stubborn?

512
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,652
The boss has been nice to you.

513
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:10,036
If this knife crosses your face,

514
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:12,414
you'll look ugly.

515
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:19,170
Agree and sign.

516
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,251
So don't make our boss mad.

517
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,092
I won't sign!

518
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:28,346
It's for your own good.

519
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:31,182
No matter whether
you sign or not.

520
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:34,103
We'll get the restaurant
sooner or later.

521
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:38,107
Tang Lung will soon be here.

522
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:43,194
Tang Lung? You think
he will come?

523
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:48,951
Tell you, he go to hell already.

524
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:48,969
Be careful!

525
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:05,254
The mastermind is over there.

526
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,119
You're crazy!

527
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,832
- Let me tell you...
- He doesn't understand Chinese.

528
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:40,181
I think of a wonderful way
to handle that Tang Lung.

529
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:43,809
Which is called, do unto others

530
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,146
as you would have
them do unto you.

531
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:55,446
Well, among my friends,

532
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,448
there is one Japanese
martial artist

533
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,450
and one European martial artist.

534
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:01,327
They are both strong,

535
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:05,374
but the problem is that they're
from different styles.

536
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,377
I'm afraid they might not
cooperate with each other.

537
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,379
Money will buy cooperation.

538
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,420
If money is not a problem,

539
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:17,468
then I suggest we must
call America for Colt.

540
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:18,469
Is this Colt good?

541
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:25,394
Is Colt good? He
is America's best!

542
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,355
You better pray that you
don't fail this time.

543
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:30,732
He will beat Tang Lung.

544
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:33,360
I'm willing to bet
my life on it.

545
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:40,366
Operator!

546
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:42,244
I'd like to call America.

547
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,748
Yes, A-me-ri-ca!

548
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:54,798
Happy New Year!

549
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,426
Happy New Year!

550
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:06,512
Here you are... thank you...

551
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,437
Here you are... thank you...

552
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:11,398
Thank you, Uncle Wang...

553
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:20,531
I didn't expect traditional
lucky money abroad.

554
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:22,451
Uncle Wang gives us
lucky money yearly.

555
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:27,331
This is my best New Year ever.

556
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,380
First, we successfully
defended our restaurant.

557
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,546
And second, we have
Brother Lung with us,

558
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:38,467
who's also our teacher.

559
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:45,556
Third, we finally
beat the hoodlums.

560
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:46,557
Good day today.

561
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:53,482
Let's enjoy the new year
and skip the violence.

562
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,276
Here comes Ching Hua.

563
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:00,571
Happy New Year!

564
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:03,492
Happy New Year!

565
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:05,369
Come, this is for you.

566
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:07,079
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

567
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:11,500
Ah Lung, a cable for you.

568
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,148
It's from my Uncle.

569
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,068
He wants you to go
somewhere to help someone.

570
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:57,379
Don't be like that I'll be back.

571
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:01,967
I won't leave until the
whole thing is settled.

572
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:12,561
Happy New Year! Beautiful
decorations indeed.

573
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:20,902
What a warm gathering.

574
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,155
What do you want?

575
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:29,953
I came to bring greetings.

576
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:37,126
It was our fault.
I must apologize.

577
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:40,129
We must all be friends.

578
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:43,048
Our boss would like to see Mr.
Tang.

579
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,967
Have a talk in person.

580
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:48,012
Would he do us the honor?

581
01:11:48,013 --> 01:11:50,932
Wonderful, this is
good beginning.

582
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:54,935
Business will be good this year.

583
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:57,814
Tell your boss we'll be there.

584
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:05,780
Meet in the Empress Restaurant
tomorrow morning. Bye-bye.

585
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:37,811
Oh, no. Please! Please, stop it.
Both of you.

586
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:39,438
- Damn it!
- Oh. Oh, no.

587
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,942
Please! Listen to me.

588
01:12:43,902 --> 01:12:45,819
Oh, please.

589
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,863
We are friends.

590
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,865
Tang Lung is our enemy.

591
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:53,953
Please wait for our boss
to come back to decide

592
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:57,249
which one of you will take
care of that Chinaman, OK?

593
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:10,095
Stop!

594
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:16,661
Sensei!

595
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:18,853
Bob's my student.

596
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:38,914
He will be the one who will
personally take care of Tang Lung.

597
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,375
<i>Yes, boss!</i>

598
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:45,171
Who can do karate better
than the Japanese?

599
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:28,339
Now that we have decided.

600
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:31,508
- Is everything arranged?
- Yes, boss!

601
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:32,926
First of all,

602
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:36,556
I'll meet them at the Empress
Restaurant early tomorrow morning.

603
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,394
You're here. Sit down.

604
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:47,400
Sorry our boss couldn't
make it today.

605
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:49,319
What's going on?

606
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:54,407
Sorry, something urgent came up.

607
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:59,036
My car's outside. I will
drive you to meet him.

608
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:00,955
What? We're to go to him?

609
01:15:01,373 --> 01:15:04,959
Never mind. Take us there!

610
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:09,255
Right! I like straight-talkers.

611
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:11,048
Let's g0!

612
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:28,065
Where is he?

613
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:38,075
He's gone.

614
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:40,286
Forget it. He won't get away.

615
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:49,379
It's a trick. Be
careful everyone!

616
01:16:17,115 --> 01:16:18,867
Leave it to me, Teacher!

617
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,745
The three of us can handle him.

618
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,120
I'll go first.

619
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,665
You? Tang Lung?

620
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:12,253
Tang Lung.

621
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:22,263
Are you Tang Lung?

622
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,335
Are you Tang Lung?

623
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:26,887
Leave it, he's
already surrendered.

624
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:29,390
Ah Lung, we're lucky this time,

625
01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:31,475
not to have fallen
into their trap.

626
01:19:31,476 --> 01:19:36,272
Tang Lung, come if you dare!

627
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,443
Ah Lung, don't let him get away.

628
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:43,905
Tony and Jimmy can
take the Japanese.

629
01:20:03,508 --> 01:20:05,425
Tony, are you all right?

630
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:09,430
I'm hurting all over.

631
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:35,539
Uncle Wang, why...

632
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:40,211
Don't blame me. If you
must, blame it on Ah Lung.

633
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:47,384
Yes, Ah Lung got you
into this mess.

634
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,554
He should not have
get in my way.

635
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:56,560
You... what do you mean?

636
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:59,104
What do I mean?

637
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:03,483
Working men have no future.

638
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:08,489
I have worked hard for half
my life but I own nothing.

639
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:14,495
My wife and children are
waiting in Hong Kong.

640
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,581
If the restaurant
cooperates with them,

641
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:20,126
they'll pay me a big reward.

642
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:26,131
Then I can return to Hong
Kong, and enjoy luxury.

643
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:32,180
You should understand
my difficulties!

644
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:08,549
Tang Lung, you've got guts.

645
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:12,613
Tang Lung, the man you
just saw will kill you.

646
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:41,642
Tang Lung, you're at
the end of your road.

647
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:24,393
You're at Death's door.

648
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:55,315
Ho!

649
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:10,330
Mr. Wang, we've failed.

650
01:35:20,299 --> 01:35:21,341
Hold it!

651
01:35:25,429 --> 01:35:27,346
We've been tricked.

652
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:31,351
Tony and Jimmy... look!

653
01:35:42,446 --> 01:35:46,366
Don't get emotional, please!

654
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:50,370
Listen to me, Mr. Tang.

655
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:57,377
Boss...

656
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:25,405
All right. Hands up!

657
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:28,408
Don't move.

658
01:36:32,871 --> 01:36:34,498
Okay. Let's go.

659
01:36:54,518 --> 01:36:58,981
Now that it's over, I must go.

660
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:02,066
I'll see you off.

661
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:07,197
No, Ah Quan has a
car waiting for me.

662
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:23,714
Take good care.

663
01:37:45,694 --> 01:37:48,696
In this world of
