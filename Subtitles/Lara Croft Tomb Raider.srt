1
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:52,699
Stop!

2
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:13,011
Hey, y'all

3
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:34,075
Little bugger!

4
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:38,246
Not live rounds, Lara.

5
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:41,582
He's in real pain right now.

6
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:46,129
This is a major remodel.
This is a disaster.

7
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,966
Was it programmed to stop before it
took my head off?

8
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,761
Ah, well, that would be a no.

9
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:57,640
But you said make it more challenging,
so...

10
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,559
Hence, the live fire.

11
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:07,108
Live rounds again.

12
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,152
Poor Simon.

13
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:11,446
What has she done to you?

14
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:10,339
Oh. Very funny.

15
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm only trying to turn you into a lady.

16
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,388
And a lady should be modest.

17
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:20,265
Yes, a lady should be modest.

18
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,368
Brothers and sisters,

19
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:41,871
today is the 15th of May,

20
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:46,209
the first day of the planetary alignment,

21
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:50,713
and we are still no nearer to discovering
the location of the key.

22
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:52,382
It seems

23
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:55,343
we are running out of time.

24
00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:57,804
This is not acceptable.

25
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:03,643
Mr Powell,
your explanation for this, please?

26
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,731
I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.

27
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:12,444
Except to once again
respectfully remind the council

28
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,237
that we are working from clues

29
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:17,115
based on
ancient cosmological models

30
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:21,077
predating Aristotle.

31
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:24,747
But I'm happy to announce
that we're almost ready.

32
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:28,084
And I am supremely confident

33
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,589
that we will have our answer in time
for the relevant planetary alignment.

34
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:36,468
So, we will have possession
of the key in

35
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,179
one week.

36
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:43,309
Yes, indeed. One week.

37
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:47,771
This is good news, Mr Powell,
but remember,

38
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:50,608
we have only a single opportunity

39
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:54,028
to retrieve the two halves of the triangle.

40
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,780
And if we fail,

41
00:08:56,865 --> 00:09:00,784
we must wait another 5,000 years.

42
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:04,788
I don't know about you,
but that's more time

43
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:08,000
than I am prepared to commit
to this enterprise.

44
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,086
We shall be ready.

45
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:14,590
Trust me.

46
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:29,355
- We're not... We're not ready, are we?
- No.

47
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,989
Good morning, Lara.
And what a beautiful morning it is.

48
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:42,618
Back to work, I'm afraid.

49
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,914
It's adventure time.

50
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,126
Egypt again.

51
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,880
It's nothing but pyramids and sand.

52
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,925
I know. Gets everywhere. In the cracks.

53
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,347
Spanish galleon?

54
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:07,477
Do you know what day it is, Hillary?

55
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:11,481
Yes, of course.

56
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,651
The 15th.

57
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:18,488
And that is never a good day.

58
00:10:42,513 --> 00:10:44,180
I miss you, Daddy.

59
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:50,104
I wish we could get back the time
that was stolen from us.

60
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,589
My father would loved to have seen this.

61
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:22,053
Tonight Pluto and Neptune
align with Uranus.

62
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:24,597
It's the first stage of the alignment
of all nine planets

63
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:27,850
culminating in a full solar eclipse.

64
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:31,020
It only happens once every 5,000 years.

65
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,897
When is the eclipse?

66
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:34,940
One week from today.

67
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:39,945
But there is plenty to look out for
until then.

68
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,074
Incredible.

69
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:19,236
I wish you could remember her.
She loved you so much.

70
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,987
Mummy!

71
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:25,742
I wish I could remember her, too.

72
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:28,912
- I still have you, Daddy.
- Yes, you do.

73
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:38,755
The exact alignment of the planets
necessary to activate the triangle

74
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,260
only occurs once every 5,000 years.

75
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:47,681
But that will prove to be
just long enough

76
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:51,059
for little Lara Croft to grow up

77
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:53,770
and to find it.

78
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,770
Bryce!

79
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,524
Hello, fellas.

80
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,110
- How's business?
- Bryce!

81
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,531
Okay, okay. I'm coming. I'm coming.

82
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:14,289
We have 83 rooms.
Why can't you live in the house?

83
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,875
Well, I'm a free spirit, me.

84
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,126
Right.

85
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,629
What's that smell?

86
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,424
5:00 a. M. Let's go.

87
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,804
This had better be good.

88
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,643
It's a clock.

89
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:39,647
I found it last night. It was ticking.

90
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,820
Must be one of them ticking clocks, eh?

91
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,115
It was hidden in a secret room.

92
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,075
Bryce.

93
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,579
Don't start.

94
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:59,626
Well, Lara, it's a clock. It ticks.
It tells the time. It's wrong.

95
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,753
It started ticking

96
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:05,089
last night during the first stage
of the alignment.

97
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,305
Well, gonna need some coffee.

98
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:19,480
Okay, in we go.

99
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:24,360
Looks pretty ordinary to me.

100
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:26,195
Well, keep looking.

101
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:34,203
Your coffee, sir.
Decaf latte with non-fat milk.

102
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:39,375
Oh, champion. Steaming sump oil.

103
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:47,132
Wait. What did you do?

104
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:50,636
- I don't know. What did I do?
- Where is that?

105
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,639
I don't know.
I just took my hand off the fibre optics.

106
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,391
What is that?

107
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:58,727
- Oh, bugger!
- Bugger.

108
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,068
Screw 13 to quadrant four.

109
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:11,407
- Screw 14 to quadrant three.
- Oh, please.

110
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:15,744
It's my map,
so I know where they all came from.

111
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,706
It's camouflage.

112
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:32,095
Okay.

113
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:43,940
Hidden within.

114
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:48,695
What is that?

115
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,452
The All Seeing Eye.

116
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,761
Lot 121, a Louis XV Ormolu
mounted bracket clock.

117
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,057
Showing on my left, #1,800,000.

118
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:20,894
#1,800,000. Thank you.
#1,800,000. #1,900,000.

119
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,896
#2,000,000. #2,000,000, now.

120
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,983
#2,100,000. #2,100,000, now.

121
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:30,488
#2,100,000.
Any advance on #2,100,000?

122
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:33,908
Any more?
#2,100,000. #2,200,000. Thank you, sir.

123
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:36,744
#2,200,000 now.

124
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:39,914
At #2,200,000. #2,300,000.

125
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:42,083
#2,300,000. #2,400,000.

126
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:46,670
Lady's bid, #2,400,000 now. #2,400,000.

127
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:48,756
Against you, sir. Two million five? No.

128
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,259
#2,400,000, then.
Lady's bid at #2,400,000.

129
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,053
#2,500,000.

130
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,640
In a new place at #2,500,000.

131
00:18:57,724 --> 00:19:01,477
Any more at #2,500,000?

132
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:03,687
Sold.

133
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:07,358
Lara, my dear.

134
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,610
- Mr Wilson.
- Let's go into my study.

135
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:11,821
Let me take that for you.

136
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:14,657
Lara Croft. I don't believe it.

137
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,495
- I'll just be a minute.
- Hi.

138
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:26,877
You still pretending to be
a photojournalist?

139
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:31,091
You know, I think it's really cool
that you still have a day job,

140
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:35,053
even though it's obviously just for show.

141
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:39,266
So, Alex, are you still pretending
to be an archaeologist?

142
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:43,436
Lara,

143
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:45,981
do we always have to fight like this?

144
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:48,400
I mean, maybe we don't.

145
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:51,361
- Maybe we do.
- Why?

146
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:54,281
- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? Stole?

147
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:56,324
From you? You know, that's funny.
You know, it's...

148
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:59,786
It's not like you ever really owned them
or anything.

149
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:03,456
Hey, you're the tomb raider.

150
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,333
Mr West, we are ready for you.

151
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:08,420
Oh, I think your clients need you.

152
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,716
Go ahead. You're wanted on the floor.

153
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,970
After all, as you once said
so memorably, "It's all just a business."

154
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:19,514
Right? So go do business.

155
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,640
Go.

156
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:49,462
Lara, this is a unique object.

157
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:52,757
Only one of the dials is working.

158
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,176
It glows, like the eye, lesser.

159
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:58,721
But it seems to be getting brighter.

160
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:01,224
And it's also running backwards,

161
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:04,644
like it's not so much keeping time,
but counting down to something.

162
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,978
- Yes.
- And look at the back.

163
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:10,608
It's as though it fits into something,
almost like a key.

164
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:17,865
Yes. Yes, fascinating.
Incredibly beautiful.

165
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:20,785
My father once told me

166
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:23,537
of a magical triangle
stamped with the All Seeing Eye.

167
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:26,707
He said it gave its possessor
extraordinary power,

168
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,126
the power to control time.

169
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:32,964
He called it the Triangle of Light.
Have you heard of it?

170
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:35,132
No. No, I haven't.

171
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:44,685
He always steered his own course,
your father.

172
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:47,688
He was a great man.

173
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:52,859
Would you like some port?

174
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:56,154
- It's really very fine.
- No.

175
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,740
I can't help you, Lara.

176
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:03,161
This clock truly is mystery.

177
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,434
- Hello.
- Lara?

178
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,436
Hello, it's Mr Wilson.

179
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:31,440
Yes. Well, I...
You see, I had a second thought

180
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:33,734
about that clock.

181
00:22:34,444 --> 00:22:36,737
There is a man
who may be able to help you.

182
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:40,490
I gave him your number.
His name is Manfred Powell.

183
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:42,451
You should see him.

184
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,870
Thank you. I will.

185
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:47,582
- Goodbye, Lara.
- You take care.

186
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,417
Thank you.

187
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:52,920
Bugger.

188
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,358
Forgive me.

189
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:28,706
Lady Croft.

190
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,542
- Ah, Mr Powell.
- Oh, no, no, no. Good heavens, no.

191
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:35,463
I'm actually his associate, Mr Pimms.

192
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:39,342
- Mr Pimms?
- Yeah, like the beverage.

193
00:23:49,353 --> 00:23:51,021
Yeah, she's here.

194
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:56,652
What does Mr Powell do?

195
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:00,197
He's a lawyer. I'm his law clerk.

196
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:04,493
It's a fairly recent appointment,
but enjoying it, all the varied work.

197
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:08,497
- A lawyer.
- Isn't it obvious?

198
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,167
Lady Croft, my pleasure.

199
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:15,504
- Manfred Powell, Q.C.
- Good morning.

200
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:19,508
I believe you are quite an authority
on things ancient and mythological.

201
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:21,009
Well, I travel.

202
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:24,012
No, no, Mr Wilson said
you were quite the archaeologist.

203
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:25,347
Please.

204
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:29,184
Oh, he's very sweet.

205
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,603
He knew your father, I believe.

206
00:24:33,857 --> 00:24:36,024
Yes, they were great friends.

207
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,778
I had the honour of meeting him
myself once, in Venice.

208
00:24:40,738 --> 00:24:43,532
I was so sorry to hear about his death.

209
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:51,039
This is the clock I spoke of.

210
00:24:55,044 --> 00:24:56,713
Very interesting.

211
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:02,594
It's a shame
you only brought photographs.

212
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:07,724
Nevertheless, it is fascinating.

213
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:10,810
You said it started ticking the night
of the alignment.

214
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:11,978
Yes.

215
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:19,235
- You said you were a lawyer?
- Yes.

216
00:25:19,904 --> 00:25:22,405
And the study of clocks is a hobby?

217
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:25,325
This is an obsession.

218
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:30,246
Really my speciality.
My practise centres around antiquities.

219
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:32,749
But the origin of this clock

220
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,626
completely eludes me.

221
00:25:37,963 --> 00:25:40,006
I think I've never seen anything quite
so beautiful

222
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,258
that I know so little about.

223
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:49,807
This is a pleasurable torment.

224
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,478
My ignorance amuses me.

225
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:58,107
"My ignorance amuses me."

226
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:02,071
"My ignorance amuses me"?

227
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:05,699
Yes, well, I've always found
your ignorance quite amusing.

228
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:08,160
- Powell, however, is not ignorant.
- No?

229
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,662
No.

230
00:26:10,455 --> 00:26:11,914
He's a liar.

231
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:28,889
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Hillary.

232
00:26:28,974 --> 00:26:31,976
- Don't you stay up too late.
- I won't.

233
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:14,978
Forward team, wait for my command.

234
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:23,403
In position awaiting your order.

235
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:48,406
Bastards!

236
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,283
Bloody hell!

237
00:28:56,957 --> 00:28:58,666
On the left. On the left.

238
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,816
Come on, Simon!

239
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,699
Bugger!

240
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:22,311
Lara, Lara, are you there? Pick up!

241
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:25,273
Lara, can you hear me? Are you okay?

242
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:30,153
I'm in the equipment room.
They're stealing my bloody clock.

243
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:31,697
I know. I saw them.

244
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,246
- You have to be my eyes.
- Are you armed?

245
00:31:40,623 --> 00:31:42,624
After a fashion, yes.

246
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:45,210
All right. Three bad guys.

247
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:47,337
Number one standing by
the Aston Martin.

248
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:48,630
Right.

249
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,301
Bingo!

250
00:32:08,985 --> 00:32:11,278
- Next.
- Okay, number two,

251
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,280
crouched by the McLaren.

252
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,743
Oh, bugger!

253
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:30,506
- Are you okay?
- I just found my car keys.

254
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,357
You're done, mate. Nice one.

255
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:07,438
I think they've all gone.

256
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:11,108
Well, they got what they came for.

257
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:14,445
Sorry about that.

258
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,739
That's fine.

259
00:34:58,365 --> 00:34:59,574
Hello?

260
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,165
What the hell happened here?

261
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:18,802
- Morning.
- Lady Lara Croft?

262
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:21,429
Yes. You have something for me?

263
00:35:31,357 --> 00:35:34,692
I woke up this morning,
and I just hated everything.

264
00:35:35,194 --> 00:35:37,403
Right. Thanks.

265
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:45,286
Who's Stribling,
Clive and Winterset then?

266
00:35:45,914 --> 00:35:49,792
- Sounds like a bunch of lawyers.
- They are a bunch of lawyers.

267
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,963
- Well, I'll shut my face again.
- You are nosy.

268
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:56,257
I'm not nosy. I just saw the name.

269
00:35:56,383 --> 00:35:59,885
It was a funny name.
I just asked her what the name was.

270
00:36:03,223 --> 00:36:05,057
It's from my father.

271
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:10,354
It was written before he died

272
00:36:10,438 --> 00:36:13,399
and delivered today
as per his instructions.

273
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,235
- Blimey!
- Holy...

274
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,622
"To see a world in a grain of sand

275
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:31,167
"and a heaven in a wild flower,

"hold infinity in the palm of your hand

277
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:37,256
"and eternity in an hour."

278
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:40,426
William Blake.

279
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:08,788
The All Seeing Eye.

280
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,605
"My darling daughter,

281
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:36,733
"I knew you'd figure this out.

282
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:39,527

I am no longer with you"

283
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:43,949
and I miss you,
and love you always and forever.

284
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,619
It also means I have failed

285
00:37:47,954 --> 00:37:51,164
and must place an awful burden
on your shoulders.

286
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:56,295
"Lara, by now I am sure you will have
discovered the clock I concealed."

287
00:37:56,964 --> 00:38:00,591
The clock is the key, Lara.

288
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:05,596
"It will unlock the hiding place of two
pieces of a sacred icon."

289
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:09,517
This is the magical triangle I told you
about when you were a little girl.

290
00:38:09,643 --> 00:38:14,105
The Triangle of Light.
But it is no bedtime story.

291
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:18,150
"The triangle was forged from metal
found in the crater of a meteor

292
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:20,278
"that had fallen to Earth
at the exact moment

"of the previous alignment
of the nine planets.

294
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:26,117
"The people of the light built a great city
in this crater

295
00:38:26,201 --> 00:38:30,121
"where they worshipped the triangle
for its ability to control time.

296
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:34,750
"It gave its possessor a power that
could be used for good or great evil.

297
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:38,546
"An abuse of this power
led to the destruction of the city.

298
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:44,760
"To be sure no man would ever again
wield this power,

299
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:47,013
"they split the triangle into two pieces

300
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:50,558
"and hid them
at opposite ends of the Earth.

301
00:38:50,684 --> 00:38:54,770
"Lara, do you remember the jasmine
that only grows in one temple

302

in Cambodia?

"Find that,

"to the Tomb of the Dancing Light

305
00:39:02,196 --> 00:39:05,157
"where the first half of the triangle
is hidden."

306
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:07,909
You must be there
at the exact moment

307
00:39:08,036 --> 00:39:11,246
of the second phase
of the planetary alignment.

318

How are you going to get to Cambodia
and get the clock back in 15 hours?

319
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:58,502
I'll be calling in a favour.

320
00:39:59,337 --> 00:40:02,589
- What kind of favour?
- Well, that is a secret.

321
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:05,258
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.

322
00:40:15,187 --> 00:40:17,271
Lady Croft, are you on target? Over.

323
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:20,483
Right on target. Thank you, boys.
Over and out.

324
00:41:01,984 --> 00:41:03,943
How predictable.

325
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,700
Alex West.

326
00:41:11,494 --> 00:41:13,871
What are you doing here?

327
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,498
We have 72 minutes
to the next alignment.

328
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:59,500
We have to work faster.

329
00:42:10,887 --> 00:42:12,387
Come on, guys!

330
00:42:50,427 --> 00:42:53,721
Come on, guys! Come on. Pull!

331
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:55,139
Pull! It's coming!

332
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,279
Good.

333
00:43:42,272 --> 00:43:45,608
So, any sign of Lady Croft?

334
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:47,276
Not yet.

335
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,613
Lara's overrated.
She's good, don't get me wrong,

336
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:53,115
but she's in it for the glory,

337
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,701
whereas I'm in it for the money.

338
00:43:55,827 --> 00:43:57,953
Fortunately.

339
00:43:58,038 --> 00:44:01,665
- Into the belly of the beast.
- And out of the demon's ass.

340
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,610
Jasmine.

341
00:46:57,178 --> 00:47:00,764
Remember, what we are looking for
is hidden not only in space,

342
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:02,516
but also in time.

343
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:05,101
The clock is the key.

344
00:47:14,612 --> 00:47:16,238
My God.

345
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,582
"Return the iron
to the stone's embrace,

346
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:29,709
"the wheel of heaven will turn.

347
00:47:29,794 --> 00:47:32,629
"Exhume the light
from its watery grave

348
00:47:33,923 --> 00:47:36,341
"to receive the gift of heaven

349
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:39,928
"as you are condemned
to the depths of hell."

350
00:47:41,598 --> 00:47:46,018
Right. Pretty much touch anything
and you get your head chopped off.

351
00:47:47,479 --> 00:47:49,564
We have two minutes, Mr West.

352
00:47:49,648 --> 00:47:52,316
You're the tomb raider. Figure it out.

353
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:07,123
Mr West.

354
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,251
Tempus fugit.

355
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:14,171
Yes, "time flies."

356
00:48:14,506 --> 00:48:16,632
It's the swords!

357
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:20,136
Come on, guys. Get up here.
Give me a hand here.

358
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:28,394
That's it. Come on. Coming down.

359
00:48:29,104 --> 00:48:31,188
I want them all down.

360
00:48:31,273 --> 00:48:33,691
Take them,
carry them across the ladders.

361
00:48:33,775 --> 00:48:35,610
Come on, guys. Let's hustle.

362
00:48:37,195 --> 00:48:41,157
All right.
Now slide them into the slots over there.

363
00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:45,703
We place the clock here
at the exact moment of alignment.

364
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:48,498
Come on. Let's go! Move it!

365
00:48:50,793 --> 00:48:53,253
Too slow, ladies, too slow. Come on.

366
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:02,554
- That's it.
- Count it down.

367
00:49:04,265 --> 00:49:07,017
- The timing needs to be exact.
- No shit.

368
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:33,502
60 seconds to go.

369
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:38,465
59, 58, 57,

370
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:39,925
56,

371
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:44,096
55, 54, 53,

372
00:49:44,472 --> 00:49:47,265
52, 51,

373
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,393
50 seconds.

374
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:58,486
Cease fire! Hold your fire!

375
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,494
- Keep counting.
- You're making a big mistake!

376
00:50:06,745 --> 00:50:09,455
41, 40,

377
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,165
- 39...
- Alex West.

378
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,917
...38...
- Hey, Lara.

379
00:50:13,002 --> 00:50:14,627
...37...
- Tourist visa?

380
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:17,547
- No, I'm working.
- Lady Croft, tell me,

381
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:19,966
is there a good reason
why I just kept you alive?

382
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,969
Yes. That is not the true eye.

383
00:50:24,304 --> 00:50:27,724
- This is the true eye.
- It's not, actually.

384
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:29,267
- It's a mirror image.
- Miss Croft,

385
00:50:29,351 --> 00:50:32,437
I think you're trying to cheat me
out of my little ray of sunshine.

386
00:50:32,521 --> 00:50:34,522
Why would I try and cheat you out
of anything now?

387
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:37,483
I need you to get the piece
so I can steal it from you later.

388
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,902
You're bluffing.
Julius, make a mental note.

389
00:50:39,987 --> 00:50:42,447
Kill Miss Croft
if she attempts any such thing.

390
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:44,407
Yes, sir, Mr Powell.

391
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:45,616
Well, we can do it my way

392
00:50:45,701 --> 00:50:47,827
or we can all come back in time
for the next alignment

393
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,163
and you are welcome
to try and kill me, then.

394
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:53,291
In, oh, say another 5,000 years.

395
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:01,759
Twelve, eleven,

396
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:03,302
ten,

397
00:51:03,386 --> 00:51:05,804
nine, eight,

398
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:11,185
seven, six, five,

399
00:51:12,979 --> 00:51:15,606
four, three,

400
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,651
two, one,

401
00:51:22,363 --> 00:51:23,489
zero.

402
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:30,329
Well, I guess she was right.

403
00:51:40,256 --> 00:51:42,424
The log must pierce the urn.

404
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,181
Come on!

405
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:53,727
It's slowing down.
It's never gonna make it.

406
00:52:10,996 --> 00:52:12,038
No.

407
00:52:44,113 --> 00:52:46,322
Pure light, fire and water.

408
00:53:39,628 --> 00:53:40,711
Croft!

409
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:19,668
Get the clock.

410
00:54:19,752 --> 00:54:21,002
Got it.

411
00:55:20,272 --> 00:55:21,522
Blast!

412
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,516
Hold it right there!

413
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,605
Lara, give it up.

414
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,234
Are you going to shoot me, Alex?

415
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,630
My phone is wet.

416
01:00:43,642 --> 01:00:44,892
Yes?

417
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,144
Lady Croft, how are you?

418
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:48,812
Alive.

419
01:00:49,064 --> 01:00:50,564
And kicking, I hope.

420
01:00:51,191 --> 01:00:53,317
- And you?
- Superlative.

421
01:00:53,485 --> 01:00:56,987
Of course, I digress.
You have my half of the triangle.

422
01:00:57,113 --> 01:00:59,281
And you have my father's clock.

423
01:00:59,366 --> 01:01:02,660
Listen, my dear. Without each other
we are quite useless at this point.

424
01:01:03,036 --> 01:01:05,412
We should reevaluate our positions.

425
01:01:05,497 --> 01:01:08,082
Like it or not,
you and I are in business together.

426
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:09,833
We should have a business meeting.

427
01:01:09,918 --> 01:01:14,338
You mean you'd love to have
another opportunity to try and kill me.

428
01:01:14,422 --> 01:01:16,173
Oh, that's harsh.

429
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:19,760
But perhaps. Wait and see.

430
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:23,222
Come to Venice, Via Dolorosa.

431
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:26,183
Wonderful. Bye then.

432
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:31,689
Harder.

433
01:01:35,235 --> 01:01:37,444
Here it comes. Hide, everybody.

434
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:40,197
Look out. It's some sort of machine.

435
01:01:41,616 --> 01:01:44,034
Bryce, it's me.

436
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:47,372
- Hello?
- Bryce, it's Lara. I found the temple.

437
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,583
- Ran into Mr Powell.
- Did you get the clock?

438
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,378
No, but I got the first piece.

439
01:01:53,796 --> 01:01:55,213
Oh, beautiful, smashing.

440
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:57,632
Seems I'm level pegging
with Mr Powell.

441
01:01:57,717 --> 01:01:59,467
Well, won't he just want to kill you now?

442
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:00,593
No, silly.

443
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,972
His problem is that he needs the piece
that I have.

444
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:07,058
Until then, I'm his new best friend.

445
01:02:07,143 --> 01:02:09,477
What about the other half?
The final alignment

446
01:02:09,562 --> 01:02:12,897
is in 66 hours and 53 minutes,
and we've still got no idea

447
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:15,650
where the second piece is hidden.

448
01:02:15,818 --> 01:02:18,278
He's going to tell me
where the second piece is.

449
01:02:18,446 --> 01:02:21,656
- He will?
- Bryce, trust me. Pack for Venice.

450
01:02:21,782 --> 01:02:24,492
Pack for where? Hello? Lara?

451
01:02:27,413 --> 01:02:28,663
Bye then.

452
01:02:58,779 --> 01:02:59,862
Drink.

453
01:03:03,658 --> 01:03:04,784
Rest.

454
01:03:06,703 --> 01:03:08,829
There's no rest for the wicked.

455
01:03:09,664 --> 01:03:11,707
You got what you came for?

456
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,043
- I did, yes.
- Too bad.

457
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:16,295
Bad for the world.

458
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:18,380
The world is safe now.

459
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:21,884
Little bit safer, perhaps,

460
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:24,970
because you will go on.

461
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:27,556
Your father said you will never give up.

462
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:31,143
My father? You knew my father?

463
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:33,729
Now, drink.

464
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:35,815
Finish your tea.

465
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:42,071
It tastes quite bad, but it is good for you.

466
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:44,240
See?

467
01:04:24,115 --> 01:04:25,574
Good evening.

468
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:31,121
You're with the Illuminati.

469
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:35,458
Beg your pardon?

470
01:04:35,835 --> 01:04:39,129
There's no such thing.
It's just a bedtime story.

471
01:04:46,596 --> 01:04:47,971
Illuminati.

472
01:04:49,473 --> 01:04:51,433
The people of the light.

473
01:04:53,769 --> 01:04:55,770
Have you brought my triangle?

474
01:04:56,188 --> 01:05:00,108
No, of course you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.

475
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:03,946
Well, you can keep the triangle
you have

476
01:05:04,448 --> 01:05:08,117
and I will keep your father's clock,
and we can be partners.

477
01:05:08,327 --> 01:05:10,036
Who sits here?

478
01:05:12,122 --> 01:05:14,457
We can be partners
and go for the big prize,

479
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:16,918
the Triangle of Light.

480
01:05:17,002 --> 01:05:19,962
Yes, but who sits here?

481
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:24,508
It's an incredible dream,
an awesome power.

482
01:05:25,218 --> 01:05:27,178
It could set right so many wrongs.

483
01:05:29,056 --> 01:05:31,223
I don't think you sit here, do you?

484
01:05:42,486 --> 01:05:44,320
I sit here

485
01:05:45,238 --> 01:05:47,698
on God's right hand, as it were.

486
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,035
In fact,

487
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:55,164
I now sit exactly where your father sat.

488
01:05:59,503 --> 01:06:00,670
You're lying.

489
01:06:01,171 --> 01:06:05,716
No. No, he mentored me in the order.

490
01:06:07,845 --> 01:06:09,388
It was truly an honour.

491
01:06:10,765 --> 01:06:12,349
I don't believe you.

492
01:06:14,435 --> 01:06:15,978
My father was not with the Illuminati.

493
01:06:16,062 --> 01:06:18,730
- He would have told me.
- He had a great many secrets.

494
01:06:22,527 --> 01:06:23,902
Not from me.

495
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,196
Especially from you.

496
01:06:31,202 --> 01:06:32,869
I know what you want, Lara.

497
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,622
Oh, I doubt it.

498
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:47,384
Another life with your father,

499
01:06:48,428 --> 01:06:50,137
a second chance.

500
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:53,432
It'll be within my power to give.

501
01:06:54,809 --> 01:06:57,060
The triangle gives its possessor

502
01:06:58,438 --> 01:07:00,272
the power of God,

503
01:07:00,648 --> 01:07:05,569
to move back and forth through time,
undo the past.

504
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:10,657
Help me, and you will get
what I know you want,

505
01:07:11,075 --> 01:07:13,286
to have your father returned to you.

506
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:20,918
And how do I know
once I gave you that piece

507
01:07:21,128 --> 01:07:23,463
that you wouldn't then just try to kill me?

508
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:29,135
Would it make it easier for you

509
01:07:29,762 --> 01:07:33,598
on more familiar ground,
if I killed you now?

510
01:07:35,768 --> 01:07:37,351
Will you reconsider?

511
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,416
- Hello, Alex.
- I suppose you think

512
01:08:41,543 --> 01:08:43,293
I'm a greedy, unscrupulous sellout

513
01:08:43,378 --> 01:08:46,338
- and do about anything for money.
- Yes, that's right.

514
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:50,175
Well, the money bit's true, I guess.

515
01:08:54,722 --> 01:08:56,515
Is it, Alex?

516
01:08:56,850 --> 01:09:00,853
If you cross me,
we may not be able to remain friends.

517
01:09:05,525 --> 01:09:07,067
Always a pleasure.

518
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:12,614
Now for a cold shower.

519
01:09:14,075 --> 01:09:15,492
I think we're in big trouble.

520
01:09:15,577 --> 01:09:16,910
- Hold this, will you?
- Thank you.

521
01:09:17,203 --> 01:09:20,539
They... They already think that we have
Lady Croft's piece of the triangle.

522
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:23,585
Yes. They think it's in that box
you're carrying right now.

523
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:26,713
Is it?

524
01:09:26,881 --> 01:09:28,590
Why don't you worry
about something else?

525
01:09:28,716 --> 01:09:30,216
Of course it's not.

526
01:09:30,968 --> 01:09:34,762
I don't understand. What chance of
success do we have without the piece?

527
01:09:35,097 --> 01:09:37,307
Zero. Don't dwell on it.

528
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:38,474
But...

529
01:09:42,605 --> 01:09:43,771
Lady Croft.

530
01:09:46,275 --> 01:09:47,984
What a nice surprise.

531
01:09:50,613 --> 01:09:52,071
Thank you.

532
01:09:54,825 --> 01:09:57,744
Now, time to save
the universe again then, is it?

533
01:09:57,953 --> 01:09:59,412
Absolutely.

534
01:10:33,949 --> 01:10:36,617
Are we sure she's really necessary?

535
01:10:37,494 --> 01:10:40,704
Well, one tomb raider is good.
Two, better.

536
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:52,800
Me bum's gone to sleep again,
all down the left cheek.

537
01:10:52,968 --> 01:10:55,344
Really? That's fascinating.

538
01:11:01,685 --> 01:11:03,811
- How much longer?
- A few hours.

539
01:11:04,312 --> 01:11:06,438
We have to take the last hour over land.

540
01:11:06,523 --> 01:11:09,024
Helicopters won't fly
near the ruined city.

541
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,194
It's a dead zone.

542
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,573
We take all doggies.

543
01:11:57,742 --> 01:12:00,201
Much-o U.S. Greenback.

544
01:12:01,245 --> 01:12:02,746
All doggies.

545
01:13:56,446 --> 01:13:58,113
Welcome to the dead zone.

546
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:15,714
It's not a country. It's an ice cube!

547
01:14:19,385 --> 01:14:20,969
Come on!

548
01:15:49,726 --> 01:15:51,811
All right. Let's go.

549
01:16:44,991 --> 01:16:46,366
Go on, get it!

550
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:55,667
Holy shit.

551
01:16:57,629 --> 01:17:01,799
It's a time storm. Time is broken here.

552
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:05,720
We must find the eye! All of you! Hurry!

553
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:08,973
We're running out of time! Hurry! Hurry!

554
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:29,661
It's begun.

555
01:17:32,873 --> 01:17:35,208
$50 says the piece is inside the sun.

556
01:18:19,003 --> 01:18:23,048
For God's sake, hurry! The eclipse
will be over in a few minutes!

557
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:33,350
Alex, give me the clock.
I know what to do.

558
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:29,741
Has she got the piece?

559
01:19:40,169 --> 01:19:41,586
We will now

560
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:44,172
unite these two parts,

561
01:19:44,757 --> 01:19:47,425
the past and the present.

562
01:19:48,594 --> 01:19:51,679
At last, we of the Illuminati

563
01:19:51,764 --> 01:19:55,266
will control time
and fulfil the sacred promise

564
01:19:55,434 --> 01:19:56,976
to our ancestors.

565
01:19:57,603 --> 01:20:01,689
- Soon, the entire world will bow...
- Enough of this twaddle.

566
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:08,947
Go on! Go on!

567
01:20:36,059 --> 01:20:38,394
Not quite what you hoped for,
Mr Powell?

568
01:20:43,066 --> 01:20:44,191
Lara,

569
01:20:46,152 --> 01:20:48,362
I have a gut instinct about this.

570
01:20:50,115 --> 01:20:52,825
After all, you are the daughter
of a genius.

571
01:20:52,951 --> 01:20:54,577
Let me test my theory.

572
01:21:46,047 --> 01:21:49,716
You had to let him go.
No more bubbles.

573
01:21:50,593 --> 01:21:52,886
You show me
how to complete the triangle,

574
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:55,513
we can change his fate.

575
01:21:56,724 --> 01:22:00,352
If you deliver me the power of God,
I will spare him.

576
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:02,938
It's only a little trip back in time.

577
01:22:03,731 --> 01:22:08,401
But I'm pretty sure you've figured out
the answer to the problem.

578
01:22:10,112 --> 01:22:13,573
And then, of course,
there's the loss of your father.

579
01:22:13,866 --> 01:22:15,241
I can change that.

580
01:22:29,883 --> 01:22:31,092
You'd better be ready for this.

581
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:40,768
- Unhook your laser sight.
- Do it.

582
01:23:17,723 --> 01:23:20,182
"To see a world in a grain of sand."

583
01:23:53,342 --> 01:23:54,509
Daddy?

584
01:23:59,515 --> 01:24:00,557
Lara.

585
01:24:03,853 --> 01:24:05,062
Is this real?

586
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:08,648
It is a crossing

587
01:24:09,817 --> 01:24:11,943
of my past and your present.

588
01:24:12,695 --> 01:24:14,905
Why did you not tell me
about the Illuminati?

589
01:24:15,531 --> 01:24:17,240
You were only a child.

590
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:19,201
You could have written in your journals.

591
01:24:19,285 --> 01:24:23,205
- You never mentioned it, not once.
- Lara, I burst to tell you everything.

592
01:24:23,706 --> 01:24:26,041
But in the fierceness
of my own battles,

593
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:28,919
I strove to tell you
only that which would inspire you

594
01:24:29,003 --> 01:24:30,587
and keep you safe.

595
01:24:31,881 --> 01:24:33,841
I love you so much.

596
01:24:35,177 --> 01:24:36,677
But I've missed you.

597
01:24:38,097 --> 01:24:39,847
And I have missed you.

598
01:24:43,102 --> 01:24:45,019
I know why you came here,

599
01:24:45,104 --> 01:24:48,356
why you took the power of the light,
but this must not happen.

600
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:52,276
Why? Why can't we use the power
just this once?

601
01:24:54,196 --> 01:24:55,696
Why can't you stay?

602
01:24:56,323 --> 01:24:58,950
We can't change time.

603
01:25:00,285 --> 01:25:02,161
But time was stolen from us

604
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,040
and it's not fair.

605
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:08,709
No, it's not fair.

606
01:25:09,711 --> 01:25:11,796
But you have stolen time itself

607
01:25:12,506 --> 01:25:14,799
and you must give it back.

608
01:25:16,552 --> 01:25:18,886
You must destroy the triangle.

609
01:25:21,056 --> 01:25:22,807
Suddenly I feel so alone.

610
01:25:24,184 --> 01:25:29,021
You're never alone. I am with you
always, just as I've always been.

611
01:26:56,403 --> 01:26:57,445
No.

612
01:27:11,669 --> 01:27:13,002
Move out!

613
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:23,554
Lara.

614
01:27:25,391 --> 01:27:26,516
Wait!

615
01:27:28,018 --> 01:27:29,727
Your father begged for his life

616
01:27:29,853 --> 01:27:31,729
when we caught him betraying us.

617
01:27:31,855 --> 01:27:34,565
He pleaded like a baby.

618
01:27:34,692 --> 01:27:35,900
Surrender.

619
01:27:38,028 --> 01:27:39,320
Never.

620
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:47,412
He seemed particularly concerned
that I shouldn't take this.

621
01:27:53,169 --> 01:27:56,338
Lara, no! The place is coming down!

622
01:27:56,423 --> 01:27:59,425
- This is insane!
- Get them out of here.

623
01:28:04,389 --> 01:28:05,723
You just hurry.

624
01:28:17,902 --> 01:28:19,528
There you go,

625
01:28:19,904 --> 01:28:21,363
safe and sound.

626
01:28:32,709 --> 01:28:33,917
No guns.

627
01:31:31,641 --> 01:31:32,933
Oh, my God!

628
01:31:35,937 --> 01:31:37,354
Quiet.
