Ohh!

4
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,589
Hey! Back to work! You guys
had a break two days ago!

5
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,138
Come on, now!

6
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:59,272
Come on, Sheba! That's my big girl!

7
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,398
Look at those pathetic worms

8
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,234
burrowing their lives away.

9
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,529
Do you know why I'm up here and
they're down there, Miss Stone?

10
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,115
Because you lied on your resume?

11
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,075
No.

12
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,829
Because I have vision.

13
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,956
And right now I have a
vision of you and me...

14
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:25,167
Dripping with coconut oil
on a beach in Rocapulco...

15
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:29,093
With Mr. Slate's fortune
to keep us company.

16
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,685
I'm glad we see eye to eye.

17
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:42,101
And somewhere down there
is the ignorant stooge

18
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:46,022
who will make all my
schemes come true.

Finally got my hair the way I like it.

I'm so excited, Fred.
I'm gonna be a father.

50
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,793
It's like a dream come true.

51
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:17,089
A son. Someone to carry on
the proud name of Rubble.

52
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,591
Think I'll be a good daddy, Fred?

00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,843
Well, you're bound to find
something you're good at.

54
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,188
Yeah, sure... Hey!

55
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,727
- Uncle!
- Heh, heh, heh.

56
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,938
You know, Fred, Betty and
I really owe it all to you.

57
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,233
We would've never qualified to adopt had
it not been for the money you gave us.

58
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,694
Remember, Barn,
that's between you and me.

59
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,531
I'd like to tell the world what
a great guy my best buddy is!

60
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,200
No, no, no!

61
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,953
True, it was a selfless, noble act,
if I do say so myself.

62
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,414
My only reward will
be your happiness.

63
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,417
I don't need to go blabbin'
my good deeds all around.

64
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,149
You're afraid to tell
Wilma, aren't you?

65
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,552
Afraid? Now, let's get
this straight, Rubble.

66
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,889
I don't need permission from
my wife to make a decision.

67
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,226
In my cave, I reign supreme!

68
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,478
Su-preme!

69
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,233
- I won't tell her, Fred.
- Thanks, pal.

70
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,892
Hiya, Timmy!

71
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,311
Here you go! Shoot, shoot, shoot!

72
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,280
Hey, Charlie!

73
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,209
- Huh?
- Wilma!

74
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,129
I'm home!

75
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,593
No, Dino! No, no! No, Dino! Bad boy!

76
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,015
Bad dog!

77
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,642
- Good doggie!
- Bad Dino breath.

78
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,644
Fred!

79
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,814
Do you have to get Dino so
wound up when you come home?

80
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,151
It's not my fault. Maybe he'd
calm down if we had him fixed!

81
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,326
What?

82
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,994
Here comes the big Daddysaurus!

83
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,753
How was your day, dear?

84
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,589
I think my Brontocrane's
pregnant again.

85
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,883
I tell ya,

86
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,136
you forget to lock her
up one Saturday night...

87
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,681
- Comfortable, Fred?
- On my way.

88
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,518
All I need's a brew and a good scratch.
Which one do you want to do first?

89
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,521
It does my heart good
to see you relaxing

90
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,607
after a hard day at the quarry.

91
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,485
I'm telling you, I married
the pick of the litter.

92
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,823
Fred, our garbage disposal
has been acting up a lot lately,

93
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,452
so I decided that it was
time to buy a new one.

94
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,247
But when I went to take money
out of our savings account...

95
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,376
- Guess what?
- New garbage disposal?

96
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,632
New garbage disposal? Why throw
good money down the drain?

97
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,549
There's nothing wrong with this one.

98
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,052
All right, you. Say "ahh."

99
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,096
Uh-uh.

100
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,812
Do you have any idea why there's
no money in our savings account?

101
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,407
There's your problem right there.

102
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,119
All right, you! Spit it out!

103
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,748
Where's the money, Fred?

104
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,458
Something happened to it.
There, I said it.

105
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,420
We have scrimped and
saved for that money.

106
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,755
And every time we get ahead,

107
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,133
you have to go blow it on
some hare-brained scheme!

108
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,929
Now, see here, Wilma!
In this cave, I am the king!

109
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,774
- And...
- And what, Fred?

110
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,357
And you have every right
to know, my queen.

111
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,230
I gave it to Barney.

112
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,732
You what?

113
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,775
I know I should've consulted you,

114
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,944
but Barney Rubble's my neighbor,
my lodge brother

115
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,322
and my best friend since the first
time I went through the fifth grade!

116
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,699
Fred Flintstone!

117
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,579
Wilma, without that money, they
wouldn't be allowed to adopt a baby.

118
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,123
So go ahead, yell,
scream, let the fur fly.

119
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,298
Give the neighbors
something to talk about!

120
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,967
What you have just done
for the Rubbles...

121
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,563
Is the sweetest, most
generous thing I ever heard.

122
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,400
And I adore you for it.

123
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,606
Mmm.

124
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,905
I also bought a new bowling ball.

125
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,326
Wait! Come on, honey!

126
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,955
- Watch your step.
- Sit down.

127
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,665
All right, all together, folks.

128
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,718
Betty, sit down and relax.

129
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,721
Oh, I can't, Wilma. It just hit me.

130
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,641
From now on, I'll be
spending 24 hours a day

131
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,185
attending to the every need
of a helpless little boy.

132
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,193
Then again, maybe it won't be
such a big adjustment after all.

133
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,870
Fred!

134
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,537
And promise you won't say anything like
you did when you saw my sister's baby.

135
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:25,541
The kid had a tail. Was I supposed
to pretend I didn't notice?

136
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:30,548
Hello, Mommy and Daddy! I have
someone who wants to meet you!

137
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,389
Well, it's not exactly
what we pictured, but...

138
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,809
- We'll love him like he was our own.
- No, no, no.

139
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,812
This little fellow belongs
to the Hendersons.

140
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,197
- So glad you'll be nursing.
- Congratulations.

141
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,248
Mr. and Mrs. Rubble,
this is your little boy.

142
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,206
Barney, isn't he precious?

143
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,916
Precious? They'd have been
better off with the monkey.

144
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,418
Fred!

145
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,962
- Does he have a name?
- Bamm-Bamm.

146
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,933
- Is that short for somethin'?
- Bamm-Bamm-Bamm.

147
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,429
You'll have to take it
slowly with this one.

148
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,558
He doesn't speak yet, and he's
a little skittish around humans.

149
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,937
But then again, I would be too if I
had been raised by wild mastodons.

150
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,940
Mastodons?

151
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,785
Let's not nitpick.
A mammal's a mammal.

152
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,489
Well, sounds to me like all
he needs is a little lovin'.

153
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,283
Ohh.

154
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,702
Come here, little guy.

155
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,329
Aah! He growled.

156
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,127
It's cute.

157
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,177
It's okay, little guy.
I'm your da-da.

158
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,054
Bamm-Bamm!

159
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,182
Oh! Barney!

160
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,434
- Oh, Betty!
- Bamm-Bamm! No!

161
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,572
Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm, wait!

162
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,699
<i>Stalactite, stalagmite
Hold your baby very tight</i>

163
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,299
- Come back!
- Come here, little guy!

164
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,846
- Bamm-Bamm! Bamm! Bamm-Bamm!
- Ohhh!

165
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,056
<i>Rock with the caveman</i>

166
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,182
Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm!

167
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,642
<i>Roll with the caveman</i>

168
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,312
<i>Shake to the caveman</i>

169
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,689
<i>Break with the caveman</i>

170
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,982
Oof!

171
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,360
<i>Make with the caveman
Okay, give me a C-A-V-E</i>

172
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,028
Whoa!

173
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,406
<i>M-A-N, Caveman</i>

174
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,991
Whoa!

175
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,826
What an arm!

176
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:13,377
"And Cinderocka married
the handsome prince, and...

177
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,220
"And they lived happily ever after."

178
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:53,194
Yeah!

179
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,422
Okay, Brother Flintstone,
we need a strike to win.

180
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,374
Can you do it?

181
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,927
Is the Earth flat?

182
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,725
- Come on, Freddie!
- Come on, hit it!

183
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,157
Come on, twinkle toes.

184
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,790
Fred!

185
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,085
- Waka-waka-woo!
- Waka-waka-woo!

186
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,796
- Wooga-wooga-wee!
- Wooga-wooga-wee!

187
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,257
Piki-piki-piki! Poki-poki-poki!!

188
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,010
Ahhhhhhhh-oooh!

189
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,137
Lava juice!

190
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,808
Hey, can I have everybody's
attention, please?

191
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,060
I would like to propose a toast

192
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:59,486
to not only a great bowler,
but a great human being.

193
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,443
And no offense to you guys.

194
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:08,825
"Since I was just a lad often,
I've had the very bestest friend.

195
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,871
"He may be big, he may be loud,

196
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,365
"so you'll never lose him in a crowd.

197
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,543
"But for my friend
the special part...

198
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,796
"Is what's behind his ribs...
His heart."

199
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:27,467
"I owe my son to him, and now...

200
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,971
"I stand before my peers and vow...

201
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:35,350
"I'll pay him back,
someday, somehow."

202
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,192
The end.

203
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:52,786
- That was beautiful, Barn.
- I meant every word of it, Fred.

204
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,247
- Care to join me in a cold one?
- Love to.

205
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,380
It doesn't get any better than this.

206
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,718
Ohh!

207
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,886
No.

208
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,681
Look at him.

209
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,267
Drunk as a skunkosaurus.

210
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,269
Aaaah!

211
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,943
Mother, I can handle this.

212
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,692
What's that old fossil doing here?
Did the tar pits back up again?

213
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:12,447
Well, somebody has to be here looking
after my daughter and grandchild...

214
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,700
While you're out carousing
with a bunch of Neanderthals.

215
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,453
Oh, really?
Well, for your information,

216
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,122
the lodge no longer
accepts Neanderthals.

217
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,793
He robs your nest egg to bail
out that little troll next door

218
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:29,130
while my daughter has to
wash her clothes in the river.

219
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,634
- I got half a mind...
- Oh, don't flatter yourself.

220
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,928
That's it! Where's my club, Wilma?

221
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,264
You just try it, fatso!

222
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,308
- If you was a man, I'd knock you...
- Enough! Mother! Fred!

223
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,645
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves!

224
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,731
I've got my hands full
just being ashamed of him.

225
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,483
You got your hands full
when you scratch your neck!

226
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,818
Stop it!

227
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,111
Both of you!

228
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:55,323
Mother, Fred is a loving
husband and a good provider.

229
00:17:55,324 --> 00:18:00,546
Oh, really? What has he ever
provided you besides shade?

230
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,872
Oh, Wilma.

231
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,458
You could've married
Elliot Firestone,

232
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,711
the man who invented the wheel.

233
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,338
Instead you picked Fred Flintstone,

234
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,716
the man who invented the excuse.

235
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,595
Let me tell you something, Pearl.
I'm not going to be a nobody all my life.

236
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,348
One of these days, I'm gonna be
a somebody, a real somebody!

237
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,727
We'll live in luxury, and Wilma
will have everything she deserves.

238
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,688
When that day comes,
you'll be so busy eatin' crow

239
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,157
you'll be passing
feathers for a month!

240
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,570
Oh, you poor, poor dear.

241
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:38,658
And when I think of all the
sacrifices your father made for you.

242
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,244
Lambs, oxen,

243
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,788
your brother Jerry.

244
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,166
- Well...
- Oh, Wilma.

245
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,710
Do your mother a favor.

246
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,379
Just call Elliot Firestone.

247
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
Even if things don't work out,

248
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,635
he can give you a great
deal on some tires.

249
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,888
- Yes, Mother.
- Byesie-bye.

250
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,265
I'll show her. I'll show everybody.

251
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,392
I know you will, Fred.

252
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,897
- Call me fatso.
- Let's get some sleep.

253
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,503
Hey, what's the special?

254
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,770
This job sucks.

255
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,646
- What you got today?
- Lizard and onions. Want half?

256
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,444
Sure.

257
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,446
I hear that eatin' too much
red meat is bad for you.

258
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,323
What a load of bunk.

259
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,494
My father ate it every day of his life,
he lived to the ripe old age of 38.

260
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,955
Your attention please.
May I have your attention!

261
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,457
I have a very important
announcement to make.

262
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,210
You found out why the guys
in pit six are losing their hair?

263
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,294
Yes!

264
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:18,016
And we are currently in the process of
refuting the results of that investigation.

265
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,093
But today I am here

266
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,720
to formally announce the creation

267
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,140
of Slate and Company's
executive placement program.

268
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:27,934
Hold your questions, please.

269
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,312
That's right, this Saturday an
aptitude test will be given,

270
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,982
granting one of you the opportunity

271
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:38,570
to crawl out of the primordial
ooze and be somebody.

272
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,822
A vice president at
Slate and Company,

273
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:45,660
with an obscene salary
and a shiny nameplate.

274
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,620
Ooh.

275
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,341
Good luck, and may
the best biped win.

276
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,838
<i>An executive? This is my
chance to be somebody.</i>

277
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,182
<i>Be somebody.</i>

278
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,593
Whee!

279
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,931
Higher, Bamm-Bamm, higher!

280
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,310
Higher! Higher!

281
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,395
Whee!

282
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,230
- Wilma.
- Hmm?

283
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,024
How did you get rid of the
ring around the collar?

284
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,243
By washing Fred's neck.

285
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,155
Hmm. You know, if Fred scores
the highest on that test,

286
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,616
you'll be able to hire someone
to do your laundry for you.

287
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:29,454
If Fred scores the highest on that test,
I'll have to hire someone to revive me.

288
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,250
Oh, it's true,
Fred's no Albert Einstone.

289
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,544
- But you never know, he may surprise you.
- Whee!

290
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,588
Well, maybe.

291
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,090
- He has been studying day and night.
- Whee!

292
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,468
I know! I've never
seen him so excited

293
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,513
about something you couldn't
spread mayonnaise on.

294
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,771
Barn, I've been thinking
about this executive job.

295
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,397
It's not me.

296
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,359
Cooped up inside some
swank office all day,

297
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,486
kissing the big shot's feet.

298
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,363
Not Fred Flintstone.

299
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,323
Why, good afternoon, Mr. Vandercave.

300
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,452
My, that's a handsome pelt
you're wearing today.

301
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,078
Thank you.

302
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,581
Your attention, please!
Please take your seats.

303
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,792
And welcome.

304
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,586
You will have one hour
to complete the exam.

305
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:23,263
Please carve all answers with
a well-sharpened No. 2 chisel.

306
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,886
On behalf of Slate and Company,

307
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,106
I want to wish you all
the very best of luck.

308
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,445
Let's begin.

309
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,022
Eeee!

310
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,906
Ohh.

311
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,997
Chisels down.

312
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,244
Please slide your answer slab

313
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,788
into the numbered envelope provided

314
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,833
and stack them neatly on my desk.

315
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,253
Psst! Hey, Fred! How'd you do?

316
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,089
How'd I do? How'd I do?

317
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:55,226
- You want me to take that up for you?
- Yeah. Thanks, pal.

318
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,655
<i>"And I stand before my peers and vow,</i>

319
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:12,376
<i>"I'll pay him back,
someday, somehow."</i>

320
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,309
Well, Cliff, the test results are in.

321
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,311
And our unsuspecting dupe is?

322
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,232
Believe it or not, the one who scored
the highest was Fred Flintstone.

323
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,527
- That big ape?
- No, the big ape got a 65.

324
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,529
Flintstone? Oh, this can't be right!

325
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,573
He must have cheated.
He's dense, he's witless...

326
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,076
He's perfect.

327
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,829
The results of the exam
were very competitive,

328
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,748
and just because an
applicant was not selected...

329
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,584
ls no indication of lack of ability.

330
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,838
- I am pleased to announce...
- I know a kiss-off when I hear one. Let's go.

331
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,090
That the newest member
of our executive rank

332
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,509
is Mr. Fred Flintstone!

333
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,013
- Huh?
- Barney, quick. What's my name?

334
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,306
- Fred Flintstone!
- Don't toy with me, Barney.

335
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,600
You did it, Fred! You made it!

336
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,103
Yabba-dabba-dabba-doo!

337
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,155
Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

338
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,492
Good morning, Mrs. Vice President.

339
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:24,799
Oh, Dino! Oh, Dino, no!

340
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,421
- Hey!
- Mmm!

341
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,016
Atta baby!

342
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,641
Oh...

343
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,396
Good boy, Dino.

344
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,711
Well, how do I look?

345
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,673
Daddy pretty.

346
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,716
It's perfect!

347
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,553
Yeah. Snazzy.

348
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:22,515
What am I gonna call
you now? Boss? Chief?

349
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,017
No, a simple "Your Highness" will do.

350
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:27,562
No, Barn.

351
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,774
I'm not gonna be one of these guys that
makes it then forgets where he came from.

352
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:36,070
The first thing I'm gonna do is get
everyone in the quarry some vacation time.

353
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,031
And maybe a health plan
with free foot care.

354
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,326
I'd settle for them little packets
of ketchup for the lunch room.

355
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,204
- I'm only one man.
- Not from the back.

356
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,173
Hey, hey.

357
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,761
Well, I guess this is it,
Mr. Flintstone.

358
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,556
Go get 'em, big guy.

359
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:08,358
- Hey, Barn.
- Yeah, Fred?

360
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,822
Could you spot me a couple
bucks for lunch? I'm a little short.

361
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,615
You're right, Fred.

362
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,530
Nothing's changed.

363
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,178
Welcome aboard, Flintstone!

364
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,379
We're glad you're here. Nice suit!

365
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,267
You know, Fred, any gravel brain

366
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,113
can shovel rock down in
the quarry, but up here...

367
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,983
- Do you know what we do up here?
- Me and the guys have always wondered.

368
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,361
We interface, Flintstone.

369
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,530
We strategize, analyze,

370
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,824
conceptualize, prioritize...

371
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,826
When do we eat?

372
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:10,873
Fred, until this moment I wasn't
sure we'd picked the right man.

373
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,422
Now I'm certain.

374
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,593
Fred Flintstone,

375
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,188
you've arrived.

376
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,567
- This is my office?
- That's right.

377
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,686
- This is my chair?
- Mmm-hmm.

378
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,688
Not to throw too much
at you on your first day,

379
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,690
but this big thing here is your desk.

380
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:39,161
- My desk?
- Watch out for your fingers in the drawers.

381
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,532
Am I interrupting?

382
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:48,327
Not at all. Fred, I'd like you
to meet your new secretary,

383
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,372
- Miss Sharon Stone.
- My secretary?

384
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,250
Personal secretary, Mr. Flintstone.

385
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,800
That is, of course, if you want me.

386
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,009
Great.

387
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,595
Well, I'm sure the two of
you would like to get...

388
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,144
Better acquainted.

389
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,104
Mr. Flintstone, I'd like you to know

390
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,858
that I enjoy working
long hours, late nights,

391
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,568
even weekends.

392
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,405
So feel free to use me

393
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,659
however you see fit.

394
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,244
Now, can I get you anything?

395
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,214
- Coffee?
- Sure.

396
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,096
- How would you like it?
- In a cup?

397
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,597
Bold choice, Mr. Flintstone!

398
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,225
You'll go far in this company.

399
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,732
Take a memo. Cliff, let's play golf.

400
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,944
We can prioritize, conceptualize
and, uh... Tenderize.

401
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,619
Executively yours, Fred Fli... Ah!

402
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:11,535
Are there six or seven
"I"s in "Fli... Ah"?

403
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,247
- Who said that?
- It was I, your dictabird.

404
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,334
- Dicta-what?
- Dictabird. Read my beak.

405
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,378
"Cliff, let's play golf.

406
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,975
"We can prioritize, conceptualize
and, uh, tenderize."

407
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,307
Wow. Wow!

408
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,972
Mr. Flintstone, I'd like to warn
you that management positions

409
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,349
are fraught with peril.

410
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,810
Whenever you find yourself
in a befuddled state,

411
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,020
I urge you to avail yourself

412
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,445
of my experience and sage advice.

413
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,817
Oh, really?

414
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,819
Listen, birdie, let's get the
pecking order straight here.

415
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,986
Hmm.

416
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:50,074
I don't need any help from you.
I'm Vice President of...

417
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,623
Of, uh...

418
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,748
Industrial procurement.

419
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,343
How about that? Excuse me.

420
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,385
Hey, guys!

421
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,842
Guess what I am!

422
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:11,595
Vice President of
Industrial Procurement!

423
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,108
Oy! Whew.

424
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,107
Yeah.

425
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,985
There. I'm all done with
the requisition forms.

426
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,529
What do you think?

427
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,532
It's perfect.

428
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,492
Looks just like the real one.

429
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:38,414
Mr. Flintstone, you are about to
embezzle a great deal of money.

430
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,876
Unfortunately, for you,
we get to keep it.

431
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,962
We can have Flintstone
sign these right away.

432
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,881
Not just yet.

433
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,759
Creatures like this
Flintstone are primitive,

434
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,637
prone to irrational
bouts of integrity.

435
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:59,395
We've got to make absolutely
certain he'll do whatever we say.

436
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,524
Fred is the greatest bowler on Earth.

437
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,694
"Fred is the greatest
bowler on Earth."

438
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,363
Now you talk, and see how
much I can remember.

439
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,705
Workin' hard?

440
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:21,207
Okay, Fred, are you ready for
your first executive action?

441
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,876
Ready and willing. Whatever
you need, consider it done!

442
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,504
Good! I want you to
fire Bernard Rubble.

443
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,923
Done... What? Fire Barney? Why?

444
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:32,676
Well, for starters, he scored the lowest
on the management aptitude test.

445
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:36,722
He's an imbecile. The company can't afford
to have dead weight like him on the payroll!

446
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,935
But, Mr. Vandercave,
he's got a new kid, a mortgage.

447
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,646
I'm his best friend. I can't.

448
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,569
Fred...

449
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,274
If you don't fire him,

450
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,276
I will.

451
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,871
And then I'll fire you.

452
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,710
Come on, Fred,
usually you're yakkin' my ear off,

453
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,504
but today you haven't said two words.

454
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,965
Something exciting must
have happened up there.

455
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:15,516
- You don't want to know, Barn, believe me.
- Sure I do, Fred.

456
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,597
You're the first one of us to
make it out of that quarry.

457
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,140
Look at me.

458
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,235
I'll probably be working
there the rest of my life.

459
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,770
No, you won't, Barn.

460
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,945
Take my word for it.

461
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,320
Come take a look... It's a dish in
the shower, you keep the soap in it.

462
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,072
Barney, there's something
we gotta talk about.

463
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,740
Yeah, yeah. Later, Fred.

464
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,826
Surprise!

465
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:42,672
Way to go, Fred!

466
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,094
- Wilma, you shouldn't have.
- Hmm?

467
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:01,724
I didn't. This was all
Barney and Betty's idea.

468
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:06,186
Aren't we lucky to have
friends like them, Fred?

469
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,896
Ohh!

470
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,190
There he is!

471
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,937
There's my big, handsome son-in-law!

472
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,073
Have you lost weight?

473
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,793
Have we met?

474
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,954
Can I have everybody's
attention, please?

475
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,998
I've got something I'd like to say.

476
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,427
I hope it's not another poem.

477
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,714
Fred... Betty, Bamm-Bamm
and I could not be happier,

478
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:37,635
- even if it was me that got that job.
- Aww!

479
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:41,847
So we got a little something to
show how proud of you we are.

480
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,822
Congratulations, big guy!

481
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,271
Barney, I can't accept this.

482
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,398
- Sure, you can.
- No, I can't. Take it back.

483
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,735
- We can't. We had your initials branded on it.
- It's yours, Fred.

484
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,905
- No, it's not!
- Fred, what's wrong with you?

485
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,907
It's a lovely gift.

486
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,207
- He's thrilled to receive it. Aren't you, Fred?
- No!

487
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,246
- Don't you like the color?
- It's not the briefcase, it's not the color.

488
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,041
- I just can't take anything from you.
- But, Fred...

489
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,251
Take a hike, shorty.

490
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:15,214
My Freddie doesn't
want that tacky thing.

491
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:18,592
- How come, Fred?
- Because you can't afford it, Barn.

492
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,721
Sure I can, pal.

493
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,432
Not anymore.

494
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,935
- You're fired.
- Fired?

495
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,777
Well!

496
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:41,454
Let's not let a little thing
like this spoil the party!

497
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,992
Conga line!

498
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,667
Conga! Conga!

499
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,422
Don't worry about me, Fred.

500
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,258
I've been working in that quarry
since it was eight feet deep.

501
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,551
Atta boy!

502
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,637
There could be a whole new
world opening up for me.

503
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,265
Maybe I'll take in that
franchise show this weekend.

504
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,860
That's the spirit.

505
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,645
There's just one thing I gotta know.

506
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,320
After all these years,
how come they're canning me?

507
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,068
Barn,

508
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,195
you're a wonderful father,

509
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,030
a loving husband,

510
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,241
a hard worker,

511
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,244
and one heck of a little bowler.

512
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:32,125
But, Barn, none of that
counts on an aptitude test.

513
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,887
You got the lowest score, pal.

514
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,641
The lowest score?

515
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,532
Wilma, that is beautiful!

516
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,535
- Well, I have always wanted...
- You can't catch me!

517
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,131
- A Halstone original.
- Mmm.

518
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,709
- Ohh!
- Now, Wilma, don't be silly!

519
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,545
Your husband's a big executive.
You can afford it.

520
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,173
Charge it!

521
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,264
Bamm-Bamm!

522
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:32,518
Ohh! Bamm-Bamm!

523
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,818
- No!
- Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm!

524
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:51,245
Gentlemen, please. I cannot
endorse this modernization...

525
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,580
if it means laying off
all those workers.

526
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,083
Some have been here since
the beginning of time.

527
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,001
What if I could
quadruple your income?

528
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,096
I'll miss them. You were saying?

529
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:07,094
Sorry I'm late. I had car trouble.
Picked up a nail.

530
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,888
Thank you for sharing
that, Mr. Flagstone.

531
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,438
May we continue?

532
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,937
Mr. Slate. Gentlemen.

533
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:20,112
I have a vision.

534
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,736
While our competitors are
mired in the Stone Age,

535
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,781
I give you... The future!

536
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,826
- Ohh.
- Slate and Company

537
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,161
will revolutionize the
building industry...

538
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,539
By providing simple,

539
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,463
low-cost, modular housing units.

540
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,752
Impossible, you say?

541
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,051
Let me demonstrate.

542
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,549
Through the miracle
of geothermal power,

543
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,303
the raw material is elevated
to the second stage,

544
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,263
where our steam-powered
conveyor belt carries...

545
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,389
Steam?

546
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,474
He's a madman!

547
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,273
Steam-powered conveyor belts...

548
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:01,231
Carry the product to be
shaped, cleaned, inspected

549
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,360
and delivered to discerning
consumers worldwide.

550
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,034
And did I mention increasing
our profit margin...

551
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,536
- Fourfold?
- Very impressive, Mr. Vandercave.

552
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:19,884
Very impressive. I think we should
implement this system immediately.

553
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,878
Yes?

554
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,672
Excuse me, Mr. Slate.
I know I'm the new man here,

555
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,518
but I don't think you hired me
to sit around and look pretty.

556
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:34,139
I hate to bust your bubble,
but if you build houses this small,

557
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,688
who's gonna live in 'em?

558
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,525
- Excuse me. Mrs. Rubble?
- Yes.

559
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:49,571
There seems to be a slight
problem with your credit carol.

560
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,657
Really? And what would that be?

561
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,081
It's no damn good!

562
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:05,253
I have never been so
embarrassed in my entire life.

563
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:10,092
- Go and play, children.
- Wilma, I promise you I'll pay you back.

564
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:13,804
- I just don't know when.
- Oh, now, Betty.

565
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,015
- It can't be as bad as all that.
- But it is.

566
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,686
Barney's still out of work, we've
nearly spent all of our savings.

567
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:25,067
And, Wilma, what if the
adoption agency finds out?

568
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,613
I don't want to lose my baby.

569
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:36,159
I swear, Betty, Fred and I
would never let that happen.

570
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,288
- Oh, Wilma.
- Oh, Betty.

571
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,336
Pterodactyl alert!

572
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,232
Mommy, help!

573
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,105
- Ow, yuck!
- Ew!

574
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,266
And in conclusion, Mr. Slate,

575
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:03,103
I feel a paid vacation for everyone
in the quarry would raise morale

576
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:07,359
and increase productivity,
um, um... A whole bunch!

577
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,444
Sincerely yours,
Frederick J. Flintstone.

578
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,949
Shall I make that "Flagstone,"
so he'll know who it's from?

579
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,950
My, don't we look handsome today?

580
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,036
Thank you.

581
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,329
Here are today's batch
of requisitions.

582
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,959
- All marked and ready for your signature.
- Okay.

583
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,127
You know, Miss Stone,

584
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:32,600
I've been signing stacks of these for weeks,
and I hate to pry, but what are they?

585
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,968
Oh, just tiny little forms

586
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,814
so that we can pay the contractors
working on the modernization.

587
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,852
We remodeled our kitchen
a couple of years ago,

588
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:48,815
and let me tell you,
contractors can be real pirates.

589
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,286
- I'm gonna read these over.
- No!

590
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:58,000
You're much too busy
for that, Mr. Flintstone.

591
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,659
Besides,

592
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,537
reading is my job.

593
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,874
You wouldn't want to
put poor little old me

594
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,251
out of work, now, would you?

595
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,979
No.

596
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,385
Your wife. Mmm-mmm.

597
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,222
- Your wife.
- My wife. Wilma?

598
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,850
- Wilma! What a surprise!
- So it would seem.

599
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,853
Miss Stone, I'd like you to
meet my wife Mrs. Flagstone...

600
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,731
And our daughter, um... Um, um, um...

601
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,942
Isn't she beautiful? My family.

602
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,697
- I've heard so much about you.
- Well, I wish that I could say the same.

603
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,280
That'll be all, Miss Stone.

604
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,449
I'll sign those documents and
place them on your desk.

605
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,044
Whatever you want.

606
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:51,211
- Your secretary is very attractive.
- Really? I hadn't noticed.

607
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,213
Did I mention she chisels
18 words a minute?

608
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,840
Hmm.

609
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,313
Hey, Wilma, did ya
ever see one of these?

610
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,598
My wife is the most
beautiful gal in Bedrock.

611
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,684
"My wife is the most
beautiful gal in Bedrock."

612
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,402
Nice try, Fred.

613
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,063
"Nice try, Fred."

614
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,317
Fred! I've come to talk about
the Rubbles' troubles.

615
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,236
Hasn't Barney found a job yet?

616
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:20,490
It's gotten so bad, they've had to rent
out their house just to make ends meet.

617
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,040
Really. Where are they gonna live?

618
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:31,918
So glad you're over your cold.

619
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,547
Thank you.

620
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,265
Isn't this nice, Betty?

621
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,768
The Flintstones and the
Rubbles, all under one roof.

622
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,981
Yes, but this is such an imposition.
Are you sure it's okay with Fred?

623
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,442
Oh, absolutely.

624
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,445
As a matter of fact,
he thinks it was his idea.

625
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:04,492
- Hey, Freddie, a couple of cool ones.
- Oh, yeah.

626
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,625
How about it, Barn?

627
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:15,795
- Flintstones and Rubbles under one roof.
- But it's only temporary.

628
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,843
It'd better be.

629
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,552
- It'd better be!
- Yeah!

630
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:26,097
Ah, Barn, I admire ya.
You've lost your job, your dignity,

631
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,599
but not your sense of humor.

632
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,401
Hey, cut it out, Fred!

633
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,358
You like your steak rare?

634
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,443
- Yeah.
- That one's yours.

635
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,279
Hey, hey, stop! Come here,
you purple rodent!

636
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,992
Don't forget to wash that
off before you eat it!

637
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,245
Come here! Give me that!

638
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,831
Help! Somebody!

639
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,486
Flintstone gets the rock.

640
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,739
He sets his shot. He shoots!

641
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,204
Oh!

642
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,412
Oh! Oh, boy.

643
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,706
Miss Stone, what a pleasant surprise.

644
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,380
Oh. What happened here?

645
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,838
- That's what I'd like to know!
- I'll get someone to fix it.

646
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,840
Oh, Miss Stone?

647
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,801
Before you go, there's
something bothering me...

648
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,887
- About this new system we're putting in here.
- Oh?

649
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,515
Yeah. I don't pretend
to understand it all,

650
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,189
but wouldn't this put a lot
of my guys out of work?

651
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,477
How would I know?

652
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,197
I'm just a little ol' secretary.

653
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,899
Are you kiddin' me? You're smart!

654
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,860
I could tell that right off.

655
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:05,405
There's a lot more to you
than you... Er... Uh...

656
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,784
- You... I mean...
- Thank you.

657
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:18,918
I sure hope I didn't get you into too much
trouble with your wife the other day.

658
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:23,256
Nah. Wilma always forgives me.
She knows I love her.

659
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,717
- And you do, don't you?
- Are you kiddin"?

660
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:29,721
I'll never forget, the first time I met
her she was working at a restaurant.

661
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:34,272
I won this "All You Can Eat" contest and
she was the one that cleaned me off.

662
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,520
Every night I go home and
look at her and I think,

663
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:41,651
"What is a beautiful woman like that
doing with a big galoot like me?"

664
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:47,331
I think I know.

665
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,160
- Where have you been?
- With Fred.

666
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,504
I mean, Mr. Flintstone.

667
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,206
I'm worried, Cliff.

668
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,957
He's smarter than we thought.

669
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,794
He'd have to be to get himself
dressed in the morning.

670
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:02,712
He's been asking a lot of questions.

671
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,965
I think we should just
call the whole thing off.

672
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:09,469
No. No, I've got a better idea.

673
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,348
Why don't we turn ourselves in,

674
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,475
then we can rot in jail until
the poles freeze over.

675
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,643
I was just thinking...

676
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,397
Stick to your strengths, Miss Stone.

677
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,404
And I'll stick to mine.

678
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,990
Besides,

679
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:32,001
if Mr. Flintstone insists
on being so conscientious,

680
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,328
perhaps we can give Fred...

681
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,628
Something to take his
mind off work, hmm?

682
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,335
- A bonus?
- That's right, Fred!

683
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,759
- You deserve it.
- For what?

684
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,715
Don't be modest, you go-getter, you!

685
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,677
And Fred, let me let
you in on a little secret.

686
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:54,347
If you really want to become a
top executive at this company,

687
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:58,227
you've got to start living like one.

688
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,203
<i>Yabba-dabba-doo!</i>

689
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,120
<i>Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones</i>

690
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:21,082
<i>They're the modern
Stone Age family</i>

691
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,460
<i>From the town of Bedrock</i>

692
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,044
<i>They're a page right out of history</i>

693
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,547
- Good afternoon, madam.
- Full serve, please.

694
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:28,923
<i>Let's ride</i>

695
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,967
<i>With the family down the street</i>

696
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,387
<i>Through the courtesy
of Fred's two feet</i>

697
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,557
<i>When you're with the Flintstones</i>

698
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,393
<i>Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time</i>

699
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,936
Oh, dear!

700
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:45,064
<i>We'll have a gay old time</i>

701
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,665
Good boy.

702
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,335
Good, Wilma! Use your arms.
Perfect. That's four.

703
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,588
Betty! Towel.

704
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,965
Keep going. Go eight.
Strong, tight. Go nine.

705
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,134
<i>A yabba-dabba-doo time</i>

706
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,104
<i>The Flintstones!</i>

707
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,690
<i>We'll have a gay old</i>

708
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,567
<i>Time</i>

709
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,736
Oh!

710
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,071
Yeah!

711
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:40,620
Who said money doesn't buy happiness?

712
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:44,624
But, Fred, isn't this
all too much too fast?

713
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:48,086
Wilma, in the buffet of life
there are no second helpings.

714
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,255
You gotta fill up your
plate, top off your cup,

715
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:53,726
and stuff a few rolls in your pocket.

716
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,427
Fred, stop!

717
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,888
Mmm. Frisky!

718
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,768
You know, Barney, life's funny.

719
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,145
One minute people are
your best friends,

720
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,981
the next you're fantasizing
they're being ripped apart

721
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,155
by a pack of rabid wolves.

722
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,328
- You too, huh?
- Oh, Barney, they've changed.

723
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,030
I hardly know them since
Fred's become such a big shot.

724
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:20,326
And it should be us squanderin' all our
money and treatin' our friends like dirt.

725
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,502
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothin'.

726
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,293
Just sour grapes, I guess.

727
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,336
Oh, don't worry, Barney.

728
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,213
It's gonna get better.

729
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,675
One day we're gonna look
back on all this and we'll laugh.

730
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,176
Jeez, I hope so, Betty,

731
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,512
'cause tomorrow they got
me testin' shark repellent.

732
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:43,016
Mmm. Oh, Barney. Ooh.

733
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,689
Leaving early?

734
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,109
Actually, the wife and I were going to have
dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.

735
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:57,035
Ooh, pricey. Be sure to put
that on your expense account.

736
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,699
Fred, before you go...

737
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,285
Would you mind chipping your
"X" on a couple of these?

738
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,828
Yeah, sure. What are they?

739
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,456
Well, you sign these and your
buddies down in the quarry

740
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,458
get some much-needed time off.

741
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:13,463
No kiddin'! I guess Mr. Slate finally
noticed all those memos I been sendin' in.

742
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:17,389
I hope the guys will know
who's to thank for this.

743
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,094
I'll make sure you
get all the credit.

744
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:29,354
Mr. Flintstone, up to
now our relationship

745
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:32,231
has not been based on mutuality
of admiration or respect.

746
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,358
Huh?

747
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,736
Put simply, you hate my bird guts
and I think you're dumber than mud.

748
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:41,032
- Ah. Well, good night.
- Still, I wish to pass on an old dictum...

749
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:43,076
From business school that
may be apropos here.

750
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,912
Only an idiot signs something
before reading it.

751
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:50,166
Excuse me. I'm the executive,
you're the office equipment.

752
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,044
If I want to ask the office
equipment for advice,

753
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,718
I'll ask the water cooler!

754
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,675
Ladies and gentlemen, the B.C.-52's!

755

Thank you, Bedrock!

Thanks, everybody. And remember,
don't drink and pedal.

778
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,180
Good night!

779
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,433
How 'bout a spin, Betty?

780
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,269
No, thank you, Fred.
I'll wait till Barney gets here.

781
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,439
He started some new job today.
I'm not sure what time he gets done.

782
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,858
While we're waiting, how about
another carafe of the bubbly?

783
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,693
Garcon! Whoops.

784
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,729
Don't worry, Mr. Flintstone.
I'll have that taken care of right away.

785
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,041
Table seven, sonny.

786
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,585
Barney!

787
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:01,464
Barney, nice skins!
Sit down, take a load off!

788
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:05,802
- I can't, Fred. I'm working here.
- You're a busboy?

789
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,428
It's honest work.

790
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,389
Yeah, I don't have to
fight Dino for my supper.

791
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:15,020
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll get you a fresh tablecloth, sir.

792
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,441
See Wilma, you were worried
he'd never find a job and

793
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,151
we'd be stuck with him forever.

794
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,905
Ow!

795
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,705
<i>Flintstone! Flintstone!
We want Flintstone!</i>

796
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:38,668
<i>The demonstration continues to
get uglier at Slate and Company</i>

797
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:43,381
<i>following the unexpected layoff
of virtually the entire labor force</i>

798
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,633
<i>by V.P. Fred Flintstone.</i>

799
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:48,719
<i>For the Cave News Network,
this is Susan Rock.</i>

800
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,013
Fred, did you hear what happened
to everyone at the quarry today?

801
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:55,017
Yup. A few hours ago, I sent them
all off on a nice, long vacation.

802
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,979
You mean, a permanent vacation.
He fired them!

803
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,939
Fred! How could you?

804
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,942
- I didn't do that.
- You did too! It's all over the TV!

805
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,110
Fred!

806
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,740
Who are you going to believe,
me or some busboy?

807
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,533
That busboy is your best friend!

808
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:14,620
Best friend? I lost my best friend
the day I became an executive!

809
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,373
He's just jealous of my
hard-earned success.

810
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:21,460
Hard-earned? Tell me something,
Mr. Vice President,

811
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,171
what's a graduated
inventory plan, huh?

812
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,674
How about supply and demand?

813
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,803
Hey, Fred! What's two and two?

814
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,139
I didn't come here to talk business.
I'm out with my wife.

815
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:37,144
Now, get me a clean spoon.

816
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,654
That does it!

817
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:44,650
The only reason you got that job is
'cause I switched tests with you.

818
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:48,738
- Oh, Barney.
- Oh-ho-ho, that's rich!

819
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:53,826
What good would it do me to switch tests
with the guy that got the lowest score?

820
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:59,040
- Think about it, Fred.
- Oh, finally it all makes sense.

821
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,334
You don't believe this, do you?

822
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,794
Are you calling my husband a liar?

823
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,755
This has gone far enough.

824
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:10,676
After everything that we've done
for you. We took you into our home.

825
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,095
Yeah? So you could show
off every chance you got!

826
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,724
You used to be such
nice people, but now...

827
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,273
You're just a couple of rich snobs!

828
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,314
Better than being a
couple of petty ingrates.

829
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:27,035
Come on, Barney.
We are moving out, tonight!

830
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,118
Hang on, Betty.
I forgot to punch out.

831
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,788
Eh, put it up top.

832
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:59,058
Betty, please. We can work it out.

833
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,644
We're all civilized people here.

834
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,271
It's too late, Wilma.

835
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:08,442
Come on, we all said things
that we didn't mean.

836
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,403
Speak for yourself.

837
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,906
Come on, Betty. Time to hit the road.

838
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,659
Fred! Aren't you even
the least bit sorry?

839
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,329
Sure, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I
ever met the little moocher.

840
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:24,333
Oh, Betty.

841
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,132
- Good-bye, Wilma.
- Oh.

842
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,782
They're gone.

843
00:58:55,574 --> 00:59:00,286
I cannot believe you just sat there
and let them walk out of our lives.

844
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,955
At least I can walk around the
house in my underwear again.

845
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:07,251
That's more important than
20 years of friendship?

846
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,836
It is on a hot day.

847
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,339
They were holding us back, Wilma.

848
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,552
We'll make new friends. There's
4,000 other people in this world!

849
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,977
- Who needs the Rubbles?
- I do.

850
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,933
But I'll tell you what I don't need.

851
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,233
I don't need this necklace.

852
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:31,108
You know, I don't need this lamp.

853
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:35,321
And I don't need this television set.

854
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:36,914
Not the TV!

855
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,126
I don't need this.

856
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,537
I don't need this.

857
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,457
I don't think I'll be needing
any of this bone china.

858
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,504
Because I don't have any
friends to invite to dinner.

859
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,925
I don't think I'll be using
any of these cups or saucers.

860
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:58,594
You're gonna regret this, Wilma.

861
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,555
It's gonna take you hours
to clean up this mess.

862
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:13,192
All right, Wilma.
Enough of this charade.

863
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:16,862
Come back now, and I'll forgive ya.

864
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,698
Oh, you're bluff in',
Wilma Slaghoople.

865
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,493
You're not going to your mother's.

866
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,370
Once around the block, you'll realize

867
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:28,375
the folly of your ways and
you'll come crawling back.

868
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,967
Please.

869
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:05,536
It's finally happened,
I've become my father.

870
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,872
Now, Barney, don't talk like that.

871
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:11,041
- This place is fine for now.
- Come on, Betty.

872
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,086
We're living downwind from
a family of wild boars.

873
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:18,137
- Face it. We've hit rock bottom.
- Hmm.

874
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,928
Come here, little guy.

875
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:26,348
Can you say da-da? Say da-da.

876
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,143
- Bamm-Bamm!
- Oh.

877
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:32,771
It doesn't really matter where we
live, as long as we're together.

878
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,819
Family hug!

879
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,451
- Betty?
- Hmm?

880
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:49,332
Exactly where did you get those eggs?

881
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,170
Sorry.

882
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,464
I think it might be twins.

883
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,187
There he is!

884
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,852
You're a traitor, Flintstone!

885
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,980
- Listen to me. I'm your friend.
- You're no friend of ours!

886
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:18,405
You're a rotten bowler too!

887
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,457
Good morning, Mr. Flint...

888
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,261
They made a fool of me.

889
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,888
Look what they had to work with.

890
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:53,352
Flintstone, heard you were
down in the file room.

891
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,271
Find anything interesting?

892
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,690
Yeah! I'm on to your little scam.

893
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,567
Billing phony companies and
keeping the money for yourself.

894
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:03,529
- I'm going to Mr. Slate.
- Good idea.

895
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,532
Turning yourself in might
buy you a little leniency.

896
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:10,327
- Me? This entire scheme was your idea.
- True.

897
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:13,080
But I've graciously decided
to give you all the credit,

898
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,541
since it's your name
on the requisitions.

899
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,293
I never touched any of that money!

900
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,795
Hmm. Fred, please.

901
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:24,675
Remodeling your house, furs, jewelry,
a fully-equipped Le Sabertooth.

902
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:27,520
Tsk, tsk, tsk. You should
have been more discreet.

903
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:28,804
I'm innocent!

904
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,224
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
Miss Stone, call security.

905
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,727
Tell them we've
uncovered an embezzler.

906
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:38,152
Miss Stone,
you'll back me up, won't ya?

907
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:42,239
You better run while you
still have a chance.

908
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,281
You'll never get away with this.

909
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:49,534
I already have.

910
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:07,268
Here comes the pterodactyl.

911
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:12,431
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- It's no use, Mother.

912
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,767
She misses Fred.

913
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:19,313
I hope it's not that
pesky Avrok lady again.

914
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:21,942
Oh!

915
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,193
- Betty!
- Oh.

916
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:27,446
- Bamm-Bamm!
- I have missed you so much.

917
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:32,326
I don't care what Barney said.
I couldn't let you go through this alone.

918
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:35,671
- Have you heard from Fred?
- No.

919
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,173
I spoke to a lawyer.

920
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:44,963
If he's missing seven years,
you can remarry.

921
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,508
Mother!

922
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:52,805
Well, wherever Fred is,
I hope he knows I still love him.

923
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,681
Oh.

924
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:59,653
<i>Calling all Bedrock units,
all Bedrock units.</i>

925
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:12,408
<i>Tonight, in a special edition

926
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:15,494

that's rocked our city,</i>

927
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:19,215
<i>"The Case of the
Embezzling Executive."</i>

928
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,379
<i>Mr. Flintstone, what are you doing?</i>

929
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,054
<i>I'm an executive. I'm embezzling.</i>

930
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,551
<i>I'm shocked!</i>

931
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:33,929
How could you ever marry that man?

932
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,474
Mother! That man is not my husband.

933
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:41,145
That's right. He plays Dr. Gravelman
on <i>The Young And The Thumbless.</i>

934
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:44,731
Fred might be a lot of things
but a thief is not one of them.

935
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,484
- Can he prove it?
<i>- Who cares?</i>

936
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:51,029
<i>Yabba-dabba-dabba!</i>

937
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,614
<i>This menace remains at large...</i>

938
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,032
<i>We ask the public's
help in apprehending...</i>

939
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,160
Maybe I can.

940
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:18,223
A little something to take that
chill off. Take a swig of this.

941
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,193
Put hair on your knuckles.

942
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:26,775
Tell me something... You one of those guys
that was laid off at the stone quarry?

943
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,317
I used to work there.

944
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,403
A lot of guys here would
like to get their hands

945
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,780
on the guy who's
responsible for all this.

946
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:38,243
- So they could hear his side of the story?
- What? His side of the story?

947
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,168
Huh? Flintstone!

948
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,420
Flintstone!

949
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,676
It is! Flintstone!

950
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,690
Squealer!

951
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,978
Get him!

952
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,274
Just think.

953
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:14,281
This time tomorrow, we'll be
on a pterodactyl winging our...

954
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,949
- Oh, Cliff.
- Hmm?

955
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:20,044
How come there's only
one ticket to Rocapulco?

956
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:27,125
For your protection, darling. I thought
I would go on a "business trip,"

957
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,002
while you stay here to
keep up appearances.

958
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:33,053
Then, when we're sure
it's safe, I'll send for you.

959
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,144
Forgive me, Cliff.

960
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,973
Looks like you've
thought of everything.

961
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:56,664
Psst. Excuse me!

962
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:01,660
- Hello.
- No, Mumsie, I don't want to go to school.

963
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,496
The other boys make fun of me.

964
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,665
Wake up!

965
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:11,837
Oh, Mrs. Flintstone. To what do
I owe the honor of this break-in?

966
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,298
I need your help, Mr. Bird.

967
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,675
You hear everything that
goes on in this office.

968
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:17,926
Hmm-hmm.

969
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,929
You are the only one who
can help clear my husband.

970
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:25,183
What a delicious irony.
Thank you for sharing it with me.

971
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:29,029
Now, let me share something with you.

972
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:33,525
Oh, now, Wilma, calm down.

973
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:37,904
- Maybe I can reason with him.
- Ow!

974
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,828
There. All set.

975
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:45,162
You know, my only regret
is I won't be around

976
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:50,334
when that shoddy new equipment
blows up in their big, dumb faces.

977
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:55,432
Oh, well, I'll just have to console
myself with all that money.

978
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:00,645
Hey, who's that?

979
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:06,559
That's Flintstone's wife.

980
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,895
What would she want
with a stinky old dict...

981
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,731
Son of a brachiosaurus!

982
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:17,908
Well, Cliff. I guess you
haven't thought of everything.

983
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:21,448
Oh, this is far from over.

984
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,249
String him up!

985
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,502
You can't do this. I was framed!

986
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:38,008
In a minute you're going to be boxed.

987
01:09:41,424 --> 01:09:43,678
Anybody want a snow cone?

988
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,395
- Barney!
- Fred!

989
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:49,226
- What are you doing here?
- I'm getting lynched!

990
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:53,480
Oh. I got cherry, lime, rocky road.

991
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:55,904
Do you know this guy?

992
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,449
Know him? He used
to be my best friend.

993
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,446
In a way, if it wasn't for me,

994
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,782
this whole mess probably
wouldn't have happened.

995
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:09,121
Thanks for filling us in. We could've
made a very big mistake here.

996
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,248
- Hang both of 'em.
- What?

997
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:14,878
Gee, take it easy. They make
you pay for your own uniforms.

998
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:19,631
Barney, I thought you
came to save me.

999
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:23,969
Save you? I saw a crowd,
I figured I'd sell a few snow cones.

1000
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,055
- You mean you haven't forgiven me yet?
- Nope.

1001
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,182
And frankly, I don't think
this is going to help.

1002
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:32,018
- I took a cherry.
- I can't break a 20.

1003
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:35,021
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute!

1004
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:39,192
Look, Barn, I know you're
still a little mad at me.

1005
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:43,864
But I want you to know, if I had to
have someone hanging next to me,

1006
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:47,164
I'm glad it's you.

1007
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:52,330
I guess switchin' them tests didn't turn
out much like I planned, huh, Fred?

1008
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,499
Hey, got any lemon?

1009
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,501
Check in the back.

1010
01:10:56,502 --> 01:11:00,213
Gee, why can't business
be this good every day?

1011
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,883
The story of my life.

1012
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:05,927
- I'm a loser.
- No, you're not.

1013
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,679
This makes me a winner?

1014
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,890
No, but you're the best
friend a guy ever had

1015
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:13,101
and that makes you a
winner in my book, pal.

1016
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,774
Me...

1017
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,735
I'm just a big jerk.

1018
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:21,651
Ah, everybody loves you, Fred.

1019
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:24,029
Except for this lynch mob.

1020
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,239
Ah, Barn.

1021
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,117
Ah, Fred.

1022
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,499
You'll have plenty of time
to bond in the afterlife.

1023
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,255
Wilma, look!

1024
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:48,729
Watch out for that tree!

1025
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:56,107
Now wait, everybody.

1026
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,773
Fred is innocent.

1027
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,902
Barney, do you have to
do everything Fred does?

1028
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:07,280
Everybody, listen to him.

1029
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:12,207
First things first.
I demand an apology.

1030
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:16,164
- I'm sorry!
- Not you, him.

1031
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,626
Me? Apologize to a bird?

1032
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:22,462
Not Fred Flintstone!

1033
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,256
I had hoped we might be
colleagues but instead,

1034
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:28,011
you've treated me as if I were an
ordinary piece of office furniture.

1035
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:30,929
I may eat bugs, but I have
feelings, Mr. Flintstone.

1036
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:33,223
And you've hurt them.

1037
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:35,101
Aww.

1038
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:41,606
Uh, well, look, I know I could've
been a little more sensitive.

1039
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,568
- Especially when you were molting.
- Oh.

1040
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,903
So, I'm... Sorry.

1041
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:50,328
I don't think they
heard you in the back.

1042
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,785
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon?

1043
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,122
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- Oh.

1044
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,042
Now, then, gather 'round, everyone.

1045
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,504
I'll tell you the tale of
an unsophisticated man

1046
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:07,299
caught up in a treacherous
web of power,

1047
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,802
deceit and lust.

1048
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:12,312
Ooh, yeah.

1049
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:16,309
Why is the door open?

1050
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:21,860
- Betty, the door is open!
- Wilma, something's wrong!

1051
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,448
- Pebbles!
- Bamm-Bamm!

1052
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,328
What kind of madman would
do something like this?

1053
01:13:40,574 --> 01:13:42,785
That's a poor poochie.

1054
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,763
That's a baby.

1055
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:56,431
- Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are gone!
- They left this.

1056
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,100
- It's a note.
- If you want to see your kids again,

1057
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,937
bring the Dictabird to the
quarry at dawn. No police.

1058
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,664
Mr. Flintstone.

1059
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:24,668
Stealing office equipment,
really. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1060
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:28,129
Is this the kind of example you
want to set for your daughter?

1061
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,132
- Where are the kids?
- The bird, please.

1062
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:36,013
- First, we want our children.
- Of course.

1063
01:14:39,264 --> 01:14:41,059
Bamm-Bamm!

1064
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,811
Take one more step, Mr. Rubble,

1065
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:46,356
and this quarry's safety record
will be severely tarnished.

1066
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:48,325
Now, give me the bird.

1067
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,237
Go on, Fred. Give him what he wants.

1068
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:55,115
- What?
- Don't worry, I got a plan.

1069
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:57,742
We're gonna get the kids back
and then we'll rescue you.

1070
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,711
What a strategist.

1071
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,124
I should have signed with Disney.

1072
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:07,595
They never would've allowed
this sort of thing to happen.

1073
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:14,138
- Ahh! Thank you, gentlemen.
- Easy.

1074
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:17,137
And in the words of
my beloved mother,

1075
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:21,609
I'm taking the money and
moving to a warmer climate.

1076
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,110
Help, Daddy!

1077
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:40,618
Let's discuss this, Cliff.
May I call you Cliff?

1078
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,622
Barney, too much pressure.

1079
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:54,674
One, two, three...

1080
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,720
Nice goin'.

1081
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,815
- Now what do we do?
- You get the kids, I'll try and stop this.

1082
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,500
Whoa!

1083
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:41,012
Cliff y, have I ever told you you
have a very distinguished chin?

1084
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,936
Shut up! Ahh!

1085
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,113
Whoa!

1086
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:54,634
Yo, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1087
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,073
Oh, dear, Oh, dear.

1088
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:03,373
Too many years behind
a desk. Mayday, mayday!

1089
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,677
Hi, da-da.

1090
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,888
You did it! You called me da-da!

1091
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:19,143
Oh, Barney, you lunkhead!

1092
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:35,191
What am I going to do?
I gotta think of somethin'.

1093
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,664
Not now.

1094
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,583
Wake up, Uncle Barney!

1095
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,670
Help, help!

1096
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:59,516
Save me! Save me
from this mad M.B.A.!

1097
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:04,267
- Don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- My hero.

1098
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:08,271
Yipes.

1099
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:12,313
Flintstone, kiss your bird good-bye.

1100
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,442
Oh, mama.

1101
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,532
Will there be anything
else, Mr. Flintstone?

1102
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,661
No, Miss Stone.
Take the rest of the day off.

1103
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:05,161
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1104
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:11,871
Cliff?

1105
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:14,841
It's time for you and
me to interface.

1106
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:34,486
- Aah!
- Stee-rike!

1107
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,166
And then, Cliff said,

1108
01:19:57,167 --> 01:20:00,712
"True. But I've graciously decided
to give you all the credit,

1109
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:04,387
"since it's your name on all
the requisition forms."

1110
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,680
Mr. Flintstone, I may
not be in on Monday.

1111
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:13,016
Don't worry, Miss Stone.
I'll tell 'em what you did.

1112
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:16,396
- They'll let you off easy.
- I've been a very bad girl.

1113
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:19,147
But you have to admit,

1114
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:23,198
I was very, very good at it.

1115
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,407
Come on, do it for Mommy. Who am I?

1116
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:32,252
- Bamm-Bamm!
- Oh.

1117
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,332
Thank goodness, you're all right.

1118
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:41,419
Well, I'm not going to jail, but it
won't be easy getting a new job.

1119
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,129
What kind of reference is
Mr. Slate gonna give me

1120
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,589
after I destroyed his quarry?

1121
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:48,468
None of this was your fault.
Mr. Slate will understand.

1122
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:51,637
Flintstone!

1123
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:53,931
Sure, now he gets my name right.

1124
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:56,025
How did this happen?

1125
01:20:56,894 --> 01:21:00,855
Mr. Slate, it all started when the
Rubbles here wanted to adopt a baby.

1126
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,191
Not that!

1127
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:06,115
How did this happen to Cliff?

1128
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:09,489
Well, you see, Mr. Slate,

1129
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:12,241
the machinery went haywire and
the rocks got all crushed up

1130
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:14,577
and that got mixed in with water
and that came all down the hill.

1131
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:17,297
- Mr. Slate, I'm sorry!
- Sorry?

1132
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:20,208
I love this stuff!

1133
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:23,462
I'm gonna name it after
my daughter Concretia.

1134
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:27,223
Flintstone, you're a genius!

1135
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,386
Me? Really? Why?

1136
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:36,641
Don't you see? Thanks to concrete,
man can now shape his own destiny.

1137
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:38,726
- The Stone Age is over!
- Ahh.

1138
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:42,605
First thing, I want you to hire
back all the men, Flintstone.

1139
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,982
- We're going into production immediately.
- We?

1140
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,150
That's right.

1141
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:50,029
You are hereby promoted to President
of the entire concrete division.

1142
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,328
Yabba...

1143
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,497
That's a real nice offer, Mr. Slate,

1144
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:02,291
but unfortunately, I'm gonna
have to turn you down.

1145
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,043
Don't listen to him, Mr. Slate.

1146
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:07,004
Fred, it's a great job!
This time, you deserve it.

1147
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,757
Barney, all my life I
wanted to be a somebody.

1148
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:13,307
And when I finally did, I turned
into somebody I didn't like.

1149
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,180
Good grief, man,
have you lost your mind?

1150
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:19,517
This could make you rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

1151
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:22,520
I was always the richest
man in the world.

1152
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,694
I just never knew it.

1153
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,191
So, if it's okay with you, Mr. Slate,

1154
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,286
all I want is my old job
back and my old life.

1155
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,997
Fred.

1156
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,576
And two weeks paid vacation
for all the men in the quarry,

1157
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:38,453
an annual cost of livin' increase

1158
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:41,707
and those little packets of
ketchup in the lunchroom.

1159
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,416
Done!

1160
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:46,511
Thanks, boss. See you
at the company picnic.

1161
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:50,678
There goes the best
executive I ever had.

1162
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,969
- Fred, I'm so proud of you.
- And I'm proud of you, Barney.

1163
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,387
- I'm starving!
- Me too!

1164
01:22:56,388 --> 01:23:00,016
What do you say we get some breakfast.
Snake and eggs for everybody.

1165
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:01,392
- My treat.
- Great.

1166
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:02,894
Barney...

1167
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:07,654
- Yeah, Fred?
- Spot me a couple bucks? I'm a little short.

1168
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:11,244
- Not this time!
- What?
