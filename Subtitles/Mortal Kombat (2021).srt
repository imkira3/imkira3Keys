2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,130
Check it's tight.

4
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,123
Close your hand.

5
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,917
That feel good?

6
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,920
- Good.
- Yeah.

7
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,760
You made it.

8
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,101
Always rely on Cole Young,
human punching bag.

9
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,642
Who am I fighting?

10
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,649
Fighting? No, no, no, Cole.

11
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,689
Fighting requires

12
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,986
both attacking and defending,
not just throwing punches.

13
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,864
You should try it sometime.

14
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,570
All right,
don't get sensitive.

15
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,865
You're fightin' Ramirez.

16
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,413
Yeah, he's experienced, fast.

17
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,583
Good fighter.

18
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,116
Who's your cornerman?

19
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,046
What? You're fucking serious?

20
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,752
You don't like it,
find someone else

21
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,042
who will do this
in an hour's notice for $200.

22
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,540
You sticking around
for this one'?

23
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,045
You know I don't
watch him fight anymore.

24
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,092
Yeah, well...

25
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,139
Give the people
a good show, huh?

26
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,682
Or they won't
stick around either.

27
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,200
Throw your uppercut.

28
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,053
You got him.
That's it.

29
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,619
No! Get up!

30
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,491
Take control!

31
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,669
Come on!

32
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,880
Come on!

33
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,683
Don't tap out.

34
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,305
It's done! Done!

35
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,565
- Back it up, Eddie.
- Yes!

36
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,761
The prophecy is upon us

37
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,469
which means we could lose
the tenth tournament.

38
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,850
There is no prophecy.
Hanzo is a ghost.

39
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,111
I killed him centuries ago.

40
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,361
Winning Mortal Kombat
can not be left to chance.

41
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,284
There will be no tournament

42
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,162
because there will be
no opposition left to fight.

43
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,031
We will already be victorious.

44
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,161
Go now and kill
Earthrealm's champions...

45
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,504
Bi-Han.

46
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,712
I am no longer Bi-Han.

47
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,011
I am Sub-Zero.

48
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,026
Cole!

49
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,983
<i>I am your blood.</i>

50
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,966
Damn, Young.

51
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,846
- Hell of a fight, man.
- Yeah, you too.

52
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,723
- Respect you.
- A'ight.

53
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,392
Ready to go?

54
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,729
In a sec.

55
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,391
What you got there?

56
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,727
It's a strength bracelet.

57
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,694
- Just made this?
- Yeah.

58
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,664
That's pretty cool.

59
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,322
You want me to put it on?

60
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,836
My hand.

61
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,171
Now we got one each.

62
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,127
You're sure you're okay?

63
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,211
Yeah. I guess I should have
thrown the uppercut, huh?

64
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,091
Cole Young.

65
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,724
The man that took the belt
from Eddie Tobias.

66
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,429
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

67
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,639
Have we met?

68
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,894
No.

69
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,229
Name's Jax.

70
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,560
Nice to meet you, Jax.

71
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,940
Could've won today.

72
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,521
Had you controlled the cage.

73
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,185
Told you so.

74
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,238
She's smart.

75
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,116
All right.
Well, time to go eat, yeah?

76
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,829
One more thing, champ.

77
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,035
That dragon logo you got,
I dig that, man.

78
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,578
It's unique.

79
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,707
Where'd you get it from?

80
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,004
He was born with it.

81
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,132
- What do you mean?
- It's a birthmark.

82
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,302
You serious?

83
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,835
Pretty cool.
Show him.

84
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,602
Well, ain't that something?

85
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,389
Nice chatting with you.

86
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,266
See you around, champ.

87
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,436
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

88
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,280
Still in one piece.

89
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,116
How'd it go?

90
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,027
He was this close
to beating him.

91
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,113
- This close?
- Close.

92
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,165
You sure you're okay?

93
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,876
Standing.

94
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,670
- Let's go order.
- Yeah.

95
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,596
Got my eyes on him
right now.

96
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,807
He's got the mark,
I saw it.

97
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,480
He's with his family.

98
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,622
Ally, come take a look at this.

99
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,131
It's snowing.

100
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,755
But it's July.

101
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,088
- Emily!
- Emily!

102
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,616
Stay calm, stay calm!

103
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,755
Get in the truck, Cole! Now!

104
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,131
Get in the car!
Come on, come on! Let's go!

105
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,783
- Move, move, move!
- Go, go, go!

106
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,373
Blade, I got him.

107
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,912
I'll see you at base at 2300.

108
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,336
What the fuck is that thing?

109
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,790
Funny, that didn't
sound much like,

110
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:43,883
"Thanks for saving my ass."

111
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,636
Whatever that was back there,

112
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,303
it's after both of us. Look.

113
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,590
That's... That's impossible.

114
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,177
It's not a birthmark, Cole.

115
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,809
Means you've been chosen.

116
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,732
Chosen? For what?

117
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:00,937
To fight.

118
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,392
You got the wrong person,
all right'?

119
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,977
I'm not the fighter
that I used to be, okay?

120
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,321
No shit. But they don't have
the marking.

121
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,194
So, like it or not, Cole,
you're the guy.

122
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,399
And as long as you got
that marking,

123
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,411
they're coming for you.

124
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,204
And they will kill whoever
they have to to get to you.

125
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,639
Take the truck.
Get your family to safety.

126
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Cole.

127
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,890
You need to get to Gary,
Indiana. Find Sonya Blade.

128
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,274
806 West Washington Boulevard.

129
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,606
Are you sure?
We can take him out together.

130
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,112
You want your family on
a fucking slab in the morgue?

131
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,031
Now, get out of here.

132
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,991
Hold on tight, guys.

133
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,713
So, you wanna play
hide- and-seek?

134
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,821
I've done six tours,
motherfucker.

135
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,830
She's finally asleep.

136
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,423
I should go.

137
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,052
You'll be safe here, Ally.

138
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,759
You heard what Jax said.

139
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,341
That thing is hunting people
with the marking.

140
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,092
It's after me.

141
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,849
And if I stay here
and it shows up,

142
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,805
it could kill us all.

143
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,644
I'm not gonna let that happen.

144
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,769
Jax could have killed it.

145
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,856
We have to be sure.

146
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,742
<i>The name he gave me.
Sonya Blade.</i>

147
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,402
<i>Hopefully,
she'll have some answers.</i>

148
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:53,938
Master.

149
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,779
Sub-Zero tracked and killed

150
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,606
another one
of Earth's champions.

151
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,365
But another has escaped.

152
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,777
Have our assassins
double their efforts.

153
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,491
What of Lord Raiden?

154
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,201
If he discovers
we're breaking rules

155
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,702
set in stone
by the Elder Gods...

156
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,537
Leave the Elder Gods to me.

157
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,869
We didn't win
nine straight tournaments

158
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,671
by following the rules.

159
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,003
Mileena, let's finish this.

160
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,384
Send in the reptilian Syzoth.

161
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,310
What are you doing here?

162
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:21,531
Wait. I'm looking
for Sonya Blade. Jax sent me.

163
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,361
Where is it?
Where's what?

164
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,535
The marking.

165
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,624
I'm Sonya.

166
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,704
Jax hasn't checked in.
Where is he?

167
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,169
He stayed behind to fight.

168
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,215
Close the door.

169
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,598
Jax, where are you?

170
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,146
Come on.

171
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,354
You guys are military?

172
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,236
Special Forces.

173
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,361
What is this?

174
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,947
We needed a safe place
to run our operation.

175
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,032
Well, this looks, uh,
pretty safe.

176
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,697
Looks like you're ready
for anything.

177
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,573
This is where we keep
all we've learned

178
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,075
about the dragon markings.

179
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,896
First learned about this
seven years ago.

180
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,955
Jax and I were
on a mission in Brazil

181
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,207
to capture a wanted fugitive.

182
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,834
When we got there,

183
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,261
the target
had superhuman abilities.

184
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,139
Tore through our unit
in seconds.

185
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,051
The target had
the same marking you do, Cole.

186
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,724
When Jax finally took it down,

187
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,357
the dragon marking transferred
directly onto his skin.

188
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,394
I've spent years trying to
figure out what it all means.

189
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,312
Seems that throughout history,

190
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,697
different cultures
all over the world,

191
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,403
they reference
a great tournament.

192
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,553
But my research shows
that there's realms

193
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,822
and species that we didn't
even know existed.

194
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,240
That dragon marking,

195
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,118
it signifies that you've been
chosen to fight for Earth.

196
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,789
It's an invitation
to fight for something known

197
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,675
as Mortal Kombat.

198
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,715
Did you make that last part up?

199
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,671
It just kind of
sounds like you made it up.

200
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,173
And look,
they spelled it wrong.

201
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,268
Hey, you listen to me.

202
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,143
I think there's
another tournament coming.

203
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,469
That's why you're here.

204
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,479
That is why Jax and I
have been tracking you.

205
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:18,983
Because we need to find

206
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,667
every last champion
before it's too late.

207
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,228
And FYI, most of them
are dead already.

208
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,902
There's more to this, Cole.

209
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,695
I know it.

210
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,952
And I swear to God, I'm going
to get to the bottom of it.

211
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,832
I hate to interrupt
your bullshit, Blondie.

212
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,492
Well, I gotta piss again.

213
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,252
Hat is this?
You have a visitor?

214
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,753
Careful. He bites.

215
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,506
Oh, hello, sunshine.

216
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Who are you?

217
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,009
That's Kano.

218
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,218
Kano?

219
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:53,761
Kano what?

220
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,344
Kano
None-of your-fuckin'- business!

221
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,387
Was that Russian?

222
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,141
Do I sound Russian to you,
you fuckin' idiot?

223
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,275
He's a mercenary
with the Black Dragon Clan.

224
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,527
Arms dealer, drug runner,

225
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,981
murder-for-hire,
scum of the Earth.

226
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,941
I also give
really good foot massages.

227
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,279
You have a marking.

228
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,197
Actually,
that's kind of a funny story.

229
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,323
You wanna tell him?

230
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,287
I was tracking another champion.

231
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,995
I was lucky enough to
find Kano here instead

232
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,244
right after
he slit the guy's throat.

233
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,503
Yeah, well, next time,
be more punctual.

234
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,380
You were never chosen.

235
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,628
Fate has better standards
than you.

236
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,590
Lucky for you,
I don't have any standards.

237
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,131
Let's see if you're
a natural blonde.

238
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,262
Not bad.

239
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,143
Almost felt that one.

240
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,841
What about you?
Where's your marking?

241
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,902
I don't have one.

242
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,743
Come on!

243
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,527
Hey, hey, new guy.
New guy.

244
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,027
Get me out of here.
I can help you.

245
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,370
Just sit tight.

246
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,781
I was about to go for a stroll,

247
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,916
but maybe I'll stick around,
you fucking idiot!

248
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,523
Fuck!

249
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,325
What the fuck was that?

250
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,112
That was my knife, too!

251
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,618
Fucking poetry.

252
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,031
Where is it?

253
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,367
- Where?
- Shh!

254
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,057
Did you shoot it?

255
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,847
I think I clipped it.

256
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,911
Sonya! Are you okay? Yeah.

257
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,492
Come on.

258
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,375
All right. I'm outta here.

259
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,089
Kano! Use the flare!

260
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,552
There you are.

261
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:11,799
Knife.

262
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,568
Kano wins.

263
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,363
You fuckin' beauty.

264
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,622
Fucking A.

265
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,954
Years of research
just destroyed.

266
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,543
So, do you believe me now?

267
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,998
Yeah. What's the plan?

268
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,376
There is none.

269
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,715
Oh...

270
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,387
Make yourself at home.

271
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,509
Yeah, I have.

272
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,178
Oh, by the way,
your beer is shit,

273
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,759
and you're almost out of it.

274
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,942
What are you doing?

275
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,772
Just working
on a Kano graphic novel.

276
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,770
I fancy myself
a bit of an artist.

277
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,861
He's a psychopath.

278
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,527
Well, all the best artists
are a little twisted, mate.

279
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,334
Well, I'm Off!

280
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,910
You're trying to get to
Raiden's Temple, aren't ya?

281
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,003
That should be fun.

282
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,131
You know where that is?

283
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,587
What's Raiden's Temple?

284
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:38,916
Yeah, I used to run guns
through there.

285
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,001
Locals wouldn't shut
the fuck up about it.

286
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,048
The legend says

287
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,255
champions used to train there
for Mortal Kombat.

288
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,764
Ah, for fuck's sake...

289
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,095
No one knows where it is.

290
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,055
Well, they do now.
Excuse me.

291
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,264
Where is it?

292
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,720
Uh, you got a pen?
You wanna write this down?

293
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:51,813
"Get fucked."

294
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,348
As if I'm gonna help you.

295
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,979
You kidnapped me.
You tied me up.

296
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,565
You threw a knife
in my fucking leg on purpose!

297
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,196
And then, that lizard thing
took off half of my face.

298
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,283
- Yeah.
- Lucky for me,

299
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,904
you can hardly notice it.

300
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,368
So, yeah,
it's a hard pass for me

301
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,866
on the "helping you" thing.

302
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,573
Now, get out of me fucking way.

303
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,701
Okay.

304
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,620
There you go.

305
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,172
Everyone's got a price.
Name yours.

306
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,381
You can't afford me.

307
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,587
Two million.

308
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,381
That's good.

309
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,599
You live in this shithole,

310
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,924
and you got two million dollars?

311
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,013
Pig's arse.

312
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,105
I have lived here my whole
life, you piece of shit.

313
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,309
You watch your mouth.

314
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,690
Two million dollars.

315
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,358
Yeah. Nah, fuck ya.

316
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,064
Fuck it.
Three million.

317
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,900
That's my final offer.

318
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,865
And anything I find
inside that temple, I keep!

319
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,370
No fucking splitsies!

320
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,415
Plus, if you're bullshitting me,

321
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,707
I'll fucking kill ya.

322
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,493
It's no skin off my sack.

323
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,165
Great!

324
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,497
Sounds like we got a deal.

325
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,042
I was gonna head there anyway.

326
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,835
Ya fuckin' idiot!

327
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,297
How are you planning
on getting us there?

328
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,306
Oh, I got a friend with a plane.

329
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,059
- You got friends?
- Hey, fuck you, pretty boy.

330
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,553
I'm a popular guy.

331
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,684
Everyone loves me.

332
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,904
Whoo!

333
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,149
Ah, bloody garden gnomes.

334
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,485
They give me the creeps.

335
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,031
You're gonna give that guy
three million dollars?

336
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,166
Fuck no.
I live in this shithole.

337
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,168
You think I got
three million dollars?

338
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,692
<i>Unleash me...</i>

339
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:05,947
There I was,
trying to shove

340
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,695
this guy's nuts down his throat.

341
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,155
And all I kept
thinking about was

342
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,906
what I should get me mum
for Christmas.

343
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,072
Your mum's been dead
for 30 fucking years, mate.

344
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,456
Kid can dream, can't he?

345
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,627
Hey!

346
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,457
You were out of it.
You okay?

347
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:20,756
Yeah.

348
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
All right.

349
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,544
Thank you for flying Air Kano.

350
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,504
I know you had fuck all choices.

351
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,505
Tray tables up. Time to jump
out of this shitbox.

352
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,763
Come on.
Let's go.

353
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,475
First time?

354
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,227
Yeah, what gave it away?

355
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
You'll be okay.

356
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,559
You just gotta jump,
count to three,

357
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,860
and pull this guy.

358
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,691
All right, simple.

359
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,938
But how do we know when to...

360
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,105
We don't got all day, princess.

361
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,117
What?

362
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,283
You're fucking kidding me.

363
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,328
So, how close are we?

364
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,417
It's 27, 28 Ks.

365
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,543
What?

366
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,797
Maybe 30, to be safe.
Let's round up to 32, eh?

367
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,470
We say 35,
there'll be no surprises.

368
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,090
Ah, shit...

369
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,679
Fuck this. I need a break.

370
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,222
You just took a break.

371
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,066
Too many beers, huh?

372
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,193
Give me that GPS.
I'm taking point.

373
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,686
Uh-uh. Let's look at
the scoreboard, shall we?

374
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,904
I got us the plane.

375
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,985
I know how to find
your precious little

376
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,862
mountain retreat,
or whatever it.

377
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,902
I killed the lizard man, huh?

378
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,478
Any of you ripped
anyone's heart out?

379
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,623
Hey!

380
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,450
I think I know
what's going on here.

381
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,665
Are you jealous, girly?
Of me little marking?

382
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,671
Hey! I'm talking to you.

383
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,295
If you want it so much,
all you've gotta do is kill me

384
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,550
and take it.

385
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,504
Ah, come on,
what do you say?

386
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,177
You wanna dance?

387
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,063
It's your blood.

388
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,312
Attagirl.

389
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:02,689
Hmm.

390
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,620
Go on, then.
Take it.

391
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,117
You're so close.

392
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,161
Just take it.
Take it!

393
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:28,884
Nah.

394
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,669
Yeah, that's why you don't
have one of these.

395
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,179
'Cause you don't have
the mongrel in ya!

396
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,226
You good?

397
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,880
At last.

398
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,512
Okay, that's far enough,
MC Hammer.

399
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,350
I'm not your enemy.

400
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,936
I'm Liu Kang from
the Shaolin Order of Light.

401
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,479
You're one of the champions.

402
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,568
Yes. From Earthrealm.

403
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,655
Finally, you have come
to seek out Raiden's Temple.

404
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,158
Fuck the Temple. Wait...

405
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,447
You just shot a fireball
outta your hand.

406
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,667
How'd you do that?

407
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,874
Hang on.
Hang the fuck on.

408
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,960
Does that mean I'm going to
get superpowers at any point?

409
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,169
It does, doesn't it?

410
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:54,838
There's much to learn.

411
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:55,964
The fuck?

412
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,090
But not here.

413
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:58,842
Follow me.

414
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,760
Ugh.

415
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,355
Hey, David Copperfield,
hang on,

416
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,567
just teach me how you do it.

417
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,829
There it is.

418
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,713
What you've been searching for.

419
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,170
It wasn't always like this.

420
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,422
For thousands of years,

421
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,183
this temple was a holy place
of worship.

422
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,227
It is essential
that we begin your training

423
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,600
for the next tournament.

424
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,273
This doesn't feel
like a tournament.

425
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,316
So far,
it feels like an ambush.

426
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,943
We don't have much time.

427
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,404
We will not see
another full moon

428
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:57,981
before the tournament begins.

429
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,290
Come, come.
Through here.

430
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,426
Now, what?

431
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,503
You gonna make a door appear
out of nowhere?

432
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,426
Ah.

433
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,637
I'll give you that.
It's pretty good.

434
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,816
Wow.

435
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,317
I knew it.

436
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,952
It's all real.

437
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,122
These murals are the living
history of Mortal Kombat.

438
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,043
Now, this one
really speaks to me.

439
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,832
This is Outworld.

440
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:58,927
Yes.

441
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:03,305
The most brutal and murderous
of all the realms.

442
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,965
Our greatest enemy.

443
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,304
Bi-Han!

444
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:17,936
<i>Unleash me!</i>

445
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,324
We must start training now

446
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,496
before our mortal enemies
in Outworld come for us.

447
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,659
The fate of Earthrealm
is in our hands.

448
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,998
There are not many of us
with the marking left.

449
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,630
So, you must train harder

450
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,008
and faster.

451
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,085
Because if you fail to
discover your inner power,

452
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,379
you will never defeat
your opponent.

453
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:49,893
They will ravage
everything you hold dear.

454
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:53,851
There will be no mercy.

455
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,768
You must fight without question.

456
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:01,522
The dragon has swallowed
many before us.

457
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,028
Now, put that back.

458
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,030
Put what back?

459
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,425
Jax! Hey! Jax?

460
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,511
Hey!

461
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,339
Oh, God...

462
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,178
It has been my charge

463
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,886
to gather
all the champions of Earth.

464
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,897
By the time I found Jax,
I was too late.

465
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,183
Well, is he gonna live?

466
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,768
The ice,

467
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,526
it cauterized his wounds.

468
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,192
We have sourced every realm
to find a way to heal him.

469
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,281
What can I do?

470
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,786
Be patient.

471
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,083
Give them time to do their work.

472
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,377
We must go.

473
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,802
He awaits.

474
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,853
The great protector,
Lord Raiden.

475
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,025
My lord.

476
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:30,069
I have gathered the remaining
champions of Earth.

477
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,917
This is what I have
to work with'?

478
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,795
You are in no physical
or mental shape to fight.

479
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,420
You don't even have a marking.

480
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,383
Oi, hang on!

481
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,477
What about me, Gandalf?

482
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:55,842
What does my fortune cookie say?

483
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,441
Powerless.

484
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,817
Arrogant.

485
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,610
The time has long passed.

486
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,146
Our enemies have claimed
nine straight victories.

487
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,610
One more victory

488
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:11,276
and Outworld will gain control
over Earth forever.

489
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:15,325
And Shang Tsung will enslave
the entire human race.

490
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,741
Sorry, what'd I miss?

491
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,372
They tried to kill my family.

492
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,301
Help us.

493
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:31,129
There is nothing for you here.
Only death.

494
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,639
Well, I'm willing to die
for my family.

495
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,094
Let's see if you have
what it takes.

496
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,643
The time has come to end this.

497
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,437
Take whatever trophies
you desire,

498
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,148
but their souls are mine.

499
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,399
Silence!

500
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,202
I have come to claim your world.

501
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,954
You're too late, Raiden.

502
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,614
It is forbidden to claim victory

503
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,245
until the tournament begins.

504
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,952
You are correct, Thunder God.

505
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,292
But conflict outside of
Mortal Kombat

506
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,382
is not forbidden.

507
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,463
Besides, the other gods
are too lazy to stop me.

508
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,595
I have come for your souls.

509
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,049
You will leave this place
at once, sorcerer.

510
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,387
These are your champions?

511
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:49,861
Kill them.

512
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,413
You think these tricks
will protect you forever?

513
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,870
Only a matter of time.

514
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,574
All right. Just circling back
on those superpowers.

515
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:43,700
I think I get it now.

516
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:44,863
It's kinda like
a box of chocolates.

517
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,948
You never know
what you're gonna get.

518
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,123
Is it gonna be fireballs?
Is it gonna be lightning? Huh?

519
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,630
Could be shit. Could be
a Frisbee hat, you know?

520
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,040
No offense, whoever you are.

521
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:58,340
The name is Kung Lao,

522
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,047
descendant of
the Great Kung Lao,

523
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:04,513
the Grand Champion
of the Order of Light.

524
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,143
Never heard of him.

525
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,436
Listen carefully,
your training has begun. Come.

526
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:14,523
Your inner power
comes from your arcana.

527
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,938
A gift from the marking
of the dragon.

528
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,447
The point of your training

529
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,070
is for you to unlock that power.

530
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,487
Without it, defeating Outworld
will be impossible.

531
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:28,241
Kung Lao and I have discovered
our arcana.

532
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,502
In the fight pit,
you will discover yours.

533
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:37,959
You may enter.

534
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,817
Let's do the damn thing.

535
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,425
I hope I get fireballs.

536
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,599
There is no guarantee.

537
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,097
So, look,
instead of fireballs,

538
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,257
what else can I shoot
out of my hands?

539
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,680
Like knives or guns or.

540
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,094
Hey, do you ever shut up?

541
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,312
You're welcome
to stay with us, Miss Blade.

542
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,065
But the training area
is for the chosen ones only.

543
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,642
Fucking whoops!

544
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,060
Oh, hang on.

545
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,229
We wouldn't be here
without her. She's one of us.

546
00:51:58,407 --> 00:51:59,818
A fighter without a marking

547
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,148
can never achieve their arcana.

548
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,867
And a fighter without an arcana

549
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,490
is a liability to the others.

550
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,780
Yeah. Liability.

551
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,076
All right, bye-bye, Blondie.

552
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,456
All right, guys!

553
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,130
Little less of this,
little more of this. Come on.

554
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,500
Be still and listen.

555
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,000
Fucking hell.

556
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,146
Jax!

557
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,274
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm here.

558
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,527
Hey, buddy.

559
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:48,456
It's okay, it's okay.

560
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,535
It's okay.
You just lay down.

561
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,542
What happened?

562
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,175
All you can do now
is test your might.

563
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,676
We have no time to lose.

564
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,057
You must unlock your arcana.

565
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,858
In Mortal Kombat,

566
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,107
talent will only get you so far.

567
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,658
Well, that was great.
Really. Good stuff.

568
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,073
You know, maybe your arcana's

569
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,371
getting your ass kicked
by a hat.

570
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,574
Huh.

571
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,548
Fight!

572
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,422
No Harry Potters hit,
all right'?

573
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:36,937
Cute.

574
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,222
Real cute.

575
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,604
I'd like to see you
try that again.

576
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,720
Is that the only move
you know, mate?

577
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,609
Ahh! Oh, fuck.

578
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:54,239
Yeah, yeah. Put a fucking
shirt on, Magic Mike.

579
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,120
It seems as though we have
our work cut out for us.

580
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,331
I was just warming up.

581
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,868
Let me see your wound.

582
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,042
Liu,

583
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,428
how do I find my arcana?

584
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,715
It must come from your soul.

585
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,885
Whatever it is that drives you.

586
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,021
So, how did you find
your arcana?

587
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:24,318
Unlike Kung Lao,
I was just a worthless stray.

588
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,113
For reasons beyond my ken,

589
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:32,322
Master Bo' Rai Cho found me
half-dead in the gutter

590
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,737
and brought me...

591
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:36,997
...to the Wu Shi Academy.

592
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,911
There, I was given a purpose.

593
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,415
A brother.

594
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,167
Kung Lao.

595
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,589
And I met Lord Raiden

596
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:50,090
who Kung Lao and I
have served together.

597
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:54,015
Upon graduation,
I was given the name of a man.

598
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,393
He was a purveyor
of rare things.

599
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:01,730
Children.

600
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,608
Orphans

601
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,649
like me.

602
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:09,647
He had a marking.

603
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,282
So, I chose to take it from him.

604
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,571
And in that moment,
my arcana came forth.

605
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,220
Fuck.

606
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,357
Come on, Major,
I've seen better than that.

607
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,025
Again.

608
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,437
Again. Again.

609
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,693
Come on, you got this.

610
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,149
God damn it!

611
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,688
These don't work.

612
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,072
These are not me.

613
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,379
I'm useless.

614
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,376
Why even bring me here?

615
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,755
I can't help.

616
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,682
My first day of training

617
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,596
and we had to run 20 miles.

618
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,269
I thought I was gonna die.
I wanted to quit.

619
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,481
But all I ever wanted
was to be accepted by you

620
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,061
as an elite fighter.

621
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,150
You remember what you told me?

622
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:34,781
"Either you keep going

623
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,326
and you prove to yourself
that you can do this

624
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,862
or regret it
for the rest of your life."

625
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,784
Are you trying
to tell me something, soldier?

626
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,874
Get off your fucking ass, Major.

627
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,550
Miss Sonya. Sit, please.

628
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,474
Here, eat.
Thank you.

629
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,727
Cole, how's your arm?

630
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,058
Uh, it's healing up.

631
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,974
Eat more, heal fast.
More training tomorrow.

632
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,977
You're fucking kidding me,
aren't ya?

633
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,441
Oh, fucking hell.
Is he on our side?

634
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,481
No, those are great, mate.

635
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,111
They make those in men's sizes?

636
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,862
Topknot! At the end.

637
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,905
What's his name? Kung Pow?
Pass us a fucking egg roll,

638
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,117
would ya?

639
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,294
You rears
painted on, mate'? Egg roll.

640
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:31,414
There you go.
Good boy.

641
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,712
Maybe you should lay off
the egg rolls,

642
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,255
seeing how you wouldn't be
ready to fight

643
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:41,883
if you had 100 days to train.

644
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,018
I'll dumb it down for you.

645
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:46,766
Fat Lazy pig...

646
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:47,857
What did you say?

647
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,645
Terrible fighter.

648
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,276
Zero skill.

649
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,688
You got a death wish, mate?

650
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,403
Combat takes intelligence.

651
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:00,864
But you...

652
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,033
you're like a dog.

653
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,869
A dog who fails
his training classes.

654
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,532
Well, how about I take that

655
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,992
stupid fucking sombrero
you're wearing

656
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,494
and shove it so far up your ass

657
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,669
you start speaking Spanish?

658
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:12,715
How does that sound?

659
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,092
You can try.

660
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,092
I just fucking might!

661
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,468
Let me ask you this.

662
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,504
Why would you jeopardize
the goodwill

663
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:23,091
of the only chance
of your survival?

664
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,599
Princess, why don't you try

665
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,926
being one of them silent monks?

666
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,515
No, no, you misunderstand.

667
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,100
He is here to save you

668
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,898
because you cannot
save yourself.

669
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,149
Oh, fuckin' here we go.

670
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,402
You're like
an aggressive little bunny.

671
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,980
Soft and useless.

672
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,490
Angry, mentally, physically.

673
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,901
You should be on your knees
before this man.

674
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,572
I got a better idea.

675
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,491
How about you two
get on your knees

676
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,158
and take turns sucking my sack?

677
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,039
Do you have any fucking idea
who you're talking to?

678
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,083
I'm wanted
in over 35 countries for shit

679
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,342
you fuckin' ballerinas
couldn't even imagine.

680
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:01,507
You're angry.

681
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,839
Oh, fuckin' nothing gets
by you, does it?

682
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:06,519
Good.

683
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,802
You should be.

684
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,220
You failure.

685
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:13,645
"Failure"?

686
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:16,769
Fuckin' "failure"?

687
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,689
Let me educate you,
motherfucker. I'm Kano!

688
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,153
Of the Black fuckin' Dragon!

689
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,613
And who are you two, huh?

690
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,528
You're some
fuckin' cave-dwelling hippie

691
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,783
twirlin' his anal beads

692
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,540
taking orders
from this Wu Shu wanker

693
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,492
who wears a hubcap as a helmet.

694
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,832
Now sit down, shut up

695
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:38,090
and pass me a fuckin' egg roll!

696
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,892
That was it, wasn't it?

697
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,272
You all saw that?

698
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,152
A laser beam!

699
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,779
It's better than fireballs,
ya pussy!

700
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,158
Come on, Kano!

701
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,239
I knew I'd get mine first.

702
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,584
We are running
out of time, Cole.

703
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,583
Focus on what you can't deny.

704
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,127
Find the truth in you.

705
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,590
Pain is the ultimate catalyst.

706
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,807
Again.

707
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:34,062
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

708
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:35,469
Does it have to be him?
I met a...

709
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,147
You know, I see a little bit
of arcana there.

710
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,365
Give me one more crack at it.

711
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,733
Focus on the pain, Cole.

712
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,484
I'm focusing! Nothing's
happening. It just hurts!

713
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,577
Oh, stick with it.

714
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,288
Again.

715
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,543
Yeah, you're right. Nothing's happening.

716
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:57,911
Could always laser you.

717
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,136
What you looking at?

718
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:20,734
Mmm. They're beautiful.
You're a lucky man.

719
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,562
Thanks.

720
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,650
You have failed
to find your arcana.

721
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,199
Without it, you are
a liability to the others.

722
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,530
So, where did this come from?

723
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,956
And why am I the only champion

724
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,159
that had the marking
since I was born?

725
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,712
Your marking comes from
your lineage, Cole.

726
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:41,917
Lineage?

727
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,459
I'm an orphan from
the South Side of Chicago.

728
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:46,377
You're a descendant of one of

729
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,838
the greatest ninjas
to ever walk the Earth.

730
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,798
Hanzo Hasashi.

731
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,680
He was murdered along with
his wife and eldest son

732
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,098
by <i>the same assassin
that hunts you</i> now.

733
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,858
Sub-Zero.

734
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:05,729
<i>The moment he died,</i>

735
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:08,156
<i>Hanzo descended
into the Netherrealm.</i>

736
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,067
<i>The farthest reaches of Hell,</i>

737
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,118
<i>endlessly searching for revenge.</i>

738
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,281
<i>But his bloodline lived on.</i>

739
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,075
<i>I rescued Hanzo's
only surviving child</i>

740
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,246
<i>and hid her in the one place
he wouldn't think to find her.</i>

741
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,292
For centuries,
the Hasashi marking

742
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,469
has passed down
through your ancestors.

743
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,047
I had hoped
the power in your bloodline

744
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:34,099
was still strong in you.

745
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:37,060
Now, I know that's not the case.

746
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,438
Go!

747
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,315
Be with your family.

748
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,240
Cole, do not give up on this.

749
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:52,578
I'm sorry.

750
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:29,529
Welcome.

751
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,862
The great hunter Nitara.

752
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,697
She's beautiful.

753
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:40,626
Isn't she?

754
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:43,582
<i>Yeah. That screech
is a real turn-on.</i>

755
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,542
My loyal warriors.

756
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,755
Kabal.

757
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,470
General Reiko.

758
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:58,183
I have seen the so-called
champions of Earthrealm

759
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,685
and they're no match
for all of you.

760
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,935
We are on the precipice
of victory

761
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,312
and taking Earthrealm forever.

762
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,648
But we must strike now.

763
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,647
Raiden has prevented entry
into his temple.

764
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:14,484
I must find away
to bring his shield down

765
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,278
in order to obliterate
our opposition.

766
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,616
<i>I think I can help.</i>

767
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,372
<i>Did you see a guy down there,</i>

768
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:24,080
<i>complete fucking asshole,
answers to Kano?</i>

769
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,295
Kano?

770
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:28,080
<i>Yeah, he's the reason
I live in an iron lung.</i>

771
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,250
<i>He's a low life
piece of shit scumbag.</i>

772
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,428
<i>You're gonna love him.</i>

773
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,221
Prince Goro!

774
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:43,683
It is an honor to have
Shokan blood on our side.

775
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:47,232
Now, we shall end this
prophecy once and for all.

776
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,126
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

777
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:15,215
<i>You backstabbing, two-faced,
ugly motherfucker.</i>

778
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,307
Kabal.

779
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,970
<i>Hey, Kano,
it's been a while.</i>

780
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,509
You getting enough sleep, mate?

781
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,054
Your eyes are a little redder
than usual.

782
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,402
<i>You've got a big mouth
for someone who's standing</i>

783
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,233
<i>on the wrong side of
the electric fence, tough guy.</i>

784
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,519
You working for
the other fellow? That wizard.

785
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,404
<i>Working with him,
not for him.</i>

786
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,482
<i>And trust me,
it has its perks.</i>

787
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,659
Like what?

788
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,111
<i>This is fucking tragic.
Look at yourself.</i>

789
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,280
<i>You used to be someone to fear.</i>

790
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,911
<i>You've fallen a long way</i>

791
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,366
<i>since you led the Black Dragon.</i>

792
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:47,992
You don't tell me
about the Black Dragon.

793
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,165
I am the Black Dragon.

794
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,047
<i>Which one's your boss?
Let me guess, the blonde?</i>

795
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,332
Is that mask cutting off your
air supply, you dumb prick?

796
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,802
I don't take orders
from anyone, Kabal.

797
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,461
<i>Then you're on the wrong side.</i>

798
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,756
<i>Fight with us and you could
have more money</i>

799
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,056
<i>than you know what to do with.</i>

800
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:03,843
<i>Hell, you could turn
this whole temple</i>

801
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,848
<i>into your own casino
if you wanted to.</i>

802
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,808
<i>Just name your price,
then double it,</i>

803
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,481
<i>then double it again.</i>

804
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:10,971
What are you waiting for,
asshole?

805
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,611
So, what would I need to do?

806
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:33,588
Just wait here.

807
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,296
What is that?

808
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:27,642
You know the problem

809
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,009
with these new lightning sticks?

810
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,854
They just don't make 'em
like they used to.

811
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,941
What, you didn't think you'd
actually change me, did ya?

812
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:46,536
The undoing of the prophecy
has begun.

813
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:02,506
Back inside.

814
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,221
Dad!

815
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,843
Get back inside!

816
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,055
Cole!

817
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:14,566
Hey!

818
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:18,652
I'm the one you want!
You see that?

819
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,489
Come get it!

820
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,581
Finish them!

821
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,573
Damn, your breath stinks!

822
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:15,556
This is not the blood
of a chosen one.

823
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:20,979
Your death has no worth.

824
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,774
Ah, girls can be so mean.

825
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,234
Don't worry, darling.

826
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,032
You're still good enough for me.

827
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,504
<i>Want me to slow down a little?</i>

828
01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,972
You're beneath me.

829
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:04,525
Now destroy him, my beauty.

830
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,365
Flawless victory.

831
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:17,970
- Dad!
- Cole!

832
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,762
Now, I tear out your spine,

833
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:22,891
champion!

834
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,271
Fuck this.

835
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,196
Mom!

836
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,996
Get in the truck.
Get in the truck!

837
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,172
Come on, come on, come on!

838
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,212
No, no!

839
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,349
Mom!

840
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,561
- Dad, help us!
- No!

841
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:07,352
No, Mom!

842
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:17,408
Cole!

843
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:18,578
Allison!

844
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,219
Get off me!

845
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,785
Dad, use your uppercut.

846
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:30,794
You Okay?

847
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,835
We're fine.
Are you okay?

848
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,207
Yeah.

849
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:36,881
Badass suit, Dad.

850
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:46,594
Blade!

851
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:53,981
Help!

852
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,252
What is that?

853
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,460
It's okay.
It's a door way back.

854
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,299
It's not over.

855
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,554
Impossible.

856
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:13,846
Thank you for helping
my fighter find his arcana.

857
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:17,098
After 4,000 years,

858
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:19,400
the Hasashi bloodline
still lives on.

859
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:21,821
Bi-Han.

860
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:30,281
Stop him!

861
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,086
Your soul is mine.

862
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,461
Liu!

863
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,637
<i>He's about to get
his soul sucked.</i>

864
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,635
<i>I love the scream
right before they...</i>

865
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,685
Liu!

866
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,355
Got ya!

867
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,877
No!

868
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:28,674
Where are we?

869
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:31,430
We are in the Void.

870
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,967
It is the realm
between your world and mine.

871
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:37,220
Shang Tsung
cannot follow us here.

872
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,327
If we were to die,

873
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,573
it was supposed to be together.

874
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,705
I am sorry, Liu Kang.

875
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,753
Without Kung Lao,

876
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,005
Earthrealm is lost.

877
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:11,639
Lord Raiden.

878
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:13,756
Why couldn't you save him?

879
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:15,762
Elder Gods are forbidden

880
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:18,845
from engaging in one realm's
war against another.

881
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:21,310
It is my job
to protect Earthrealm,

882
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,941
but I cannot save
every soul within it.

883
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,070
No.

884
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,902
It's not over.
We still need to fight.

885
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,239
Cole.

886
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:39,370
The blood on this blade
is your ancestor's.

887
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,704
Hanzo Hasashi's.

888
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:44,120
I took it from him
the day he died.

889
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:48,007
Use it, and the spirit of
Hanzo fights with you.

890
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:53,467
So, what's the plan?

891
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:58,343
We need to fight smarter.
We need to control the fight.

892
01:20:58,729 --> 01:20:59,729
How?

893
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:01,678
I mean, they're better trained
and better prepared.

894
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,290
Plus, they don't mind
breaking the rules.

895
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,898
We need to split them up.

896
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:11,110
Lord Raiden, can you send
anyone anywhere?

897
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,227
Well, they don't want
a tournament.

898
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:16,194
Let's give 'em one,
but let's do it our way.

899
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,240
Give me Reiko.
I got a score to settle.

900
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,083
Hey, big boy.

901
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:36,557
Sonya...

902
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:38,508
Please tell me I get the bitch
with the teeth.

903
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,551
You get to take out
your old buddy Kano.

904
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:43,929
I know I've seen you
kick his ass before,

905
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,227
but he's got a laser now.

906
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,688
Watch out for that.
Oh, I got an idea.

907
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:50,686
Honey, I'm home.

908
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:52,939
Liu and I will take
Mileena and Kabal.

909
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:54,528
I know this is personal for you.

910
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,029
Are you ready?

911
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,619
You again.

912
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,421
What about Sub-Zero?

913
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,298
Nobody's taking him out
one-on-one.

914
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,468
Yeah.

915
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,047
We save Sub-Zero for last.

916
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:17,346
We take him out together.
As a team.

917
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,118
Yeah, these motherfuckers work.

918
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,131
God damn it!

919
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,462
I'd come out if I were you!

920
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:52,896
God damn it!

921
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,626
Fucking bitch.

922
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:16,340
Hey!

923
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,349
You owe me
three million dollars!

924
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,125
There you are. Come here.

925
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:53,627
There we go!

926
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,421
Fuckin' hell.

927
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,715
That was a bit harder
than I thought.

928
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:04,801
Tell me, Blondie,
how does that feel, huh?

929
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:10,223
Feels fucking amazing, mate.

930
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,338
<i>Oh, I'm sorry,
did I cut you?</i>

931
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:58,058
<i>What the fuck?</i>

932
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,623
Oh, shit!

933
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:27,550
Fatality.

934
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:29,684
For Kung Lao.

935
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,359
Shit.

936
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,792
A little nap?

937
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:15,636
That's pretty cool.

938
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:17,430
A little parting gift from Kano.

939
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,771
Okay, I'm almost
ready. How about you?

940
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:23,226
You sure Dad's gonna be
able to find us?

941
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,238
Completely sure.

942
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,882
Look, I just want to get us
out of here.

943
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:28,444
Fuck another four-armed
monster showing up.

944
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:02,943
Emily!

945
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,150
No!

946
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,107
Emily! No!

947
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,039
Allison!

948
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:29,669
Finally, the Hasashi bloodline
will end.

949
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,826
Now, you will die
with your family.

950
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,728
The blade of Hanzo.

951
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,619
Get over here.

952
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,704
For the Lin Kuei.

953
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,763
Dad. I got you.
I got you.

954
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:36,353
<i>Hasashi Hanzo, Scorpion.</i>

955
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:40,150
Dad.

956
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,506
These are my friends.

957
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:11,880
I am Liu Kang.

958
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,259
Sit. I will warm you.

959
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,437
I'm impressed.

960
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:27,104
I thought you said
you couldn't get involved.

961
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,242
Shang Tsung!

962
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:52,971
The prophecy has been fulfilled.

963
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:56,725
Has the blood on your hands
told you nothing?

964
01:36:57,103 --> 01:37:00,596
No matter how many of my
people you put in the ground,

965
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:04,641
there will always be another
to take their place.

966
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:09,771
Today, you have killed
my warriors

967
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:11,986
and you think you have won,

968
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:15,369
but death
is only another portal.

969
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,500
Next time I see you,

970
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,291
I will not bring fighters.

971
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:31,884
I will bring armies.

972
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:35,764
You will return
to Outworld at once.

973
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:36,933
Earth will...

974
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:45,811
He talks too much.

975
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:51,154
What happens next?

976
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:52,985
Today, we are victorious,

977
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:56,368
but there are other enemies
to fight.

978
01:37:57,455 --> 01:37:59,822
We can not let our guard down.

979
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:03,575
I'll assemble
a new list of champions.

980
01:38:04,921 --> 01:38:06,628
You must find them.

981
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:09,372
Who's first?

982
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:21,517
My man!

983
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:23,849
Was just about to call you.

984
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:26,189
I need you.
Tomorrow night.

985
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:29,772
Sorry. My days fighting
for 200 bucks are done.

986
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:32,104
Ah, you're finally
quitting, huh?

987
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:35,023
Yeah, uh, something like that.

988
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:36,816
Where you gonna go?

989
01:38:37,203 --> 01:38:38,238
Hollywood.

990
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:39,824
Hollywood?

991
