<i>It looks like the storm
has passed, New Yorkers.</i>

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,121
<i>A season-high seven inches
of rain last night.</i>

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,168
<i>High winds and flooding in some areas...</i>

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,163
<i>even left some New Yorkers stranded.</i>

6
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,163
<i>City crews still working this morning.</i>

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,164
<i>They're trying to restore power
to several areas in the boroughs.</i>

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,648
<i>Good news is, today should be sunny
with highs in the low 60s...</i>

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,802
<i>unseasonably mild...</i>

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,202
<i>a real change from the relentless weather
of these past few weeks.</i>

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,762
<i>So get out there, enjoy the sun,
go to the park, get outside if you can...</i>

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,842
<i>because it's not gonna last long.</i>

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,883
<i>Winter storms are turning
later in the week...</i>

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,089
<i>Making for a severe temperature drop
over the weekend.</i>

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,084
<i>Could be signs for an early
and potentially long winter.</i>

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,362
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,169
<i>Looking at you.</i>

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,202
<i>Come here.</i>

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,962
<i>Are you still filming?</i>

20
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,604
<i>Just an anniversary.</i>

21
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,290
It's been a while.

22
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,244
My condolences.

23
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,450
How are you holding up?

24
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,323
I keep asking, “Why her?”

25
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,688
There's no rhyme or reason to this life.

26
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,162
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.

27
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,644
Are you sure?

28
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,882
Don't blame yourself.

29
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,850
What are you really doing here, Marcus?

30
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,045
Just checkin' up on an old friend.

31
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,565
Good-bye, John.

32
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,607

- Yes.

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,245
And the pen.

35
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,366
Sorry.

36
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,681
- Here you go. Good night.
- Thanks.

39
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,640
<i>So start with this.</i>

40
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,724

41

On. Right.

- How much?
- Excuse me?

68
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,250
How much for the car?

69
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,083
She's not for sale.

Where'd you get that car?

81
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,930
Is it here?

82
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,251
It was.

Yeah.

87
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,766
Get out of my shop. Get out right now.

88
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,208
Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio?
Because we own you.

What did you say to me?

90

We own you.

91
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,924
You don't own me, punk.

92
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,128
I work with your father. All right?

93
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,171
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?

94
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,605
No.

95
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,286
We sure as hell fucked up his dog.

That's great, man. Come on.

102
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,170
Now, you kill me right now...

103
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,528
or you get the fuck out of my shop.

104
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,884
Viggo is not gonna like this.

105
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,804
How do you know what Viggo likes
or doesn't like?

106
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,201
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.

107
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,564
You've got a fuckin' pair on you, old man!

108

112
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,602
I heard you struck my son.

113
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,605
- Yes, sir, I did.
- And may I ask why?

114
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,241
Yeah, well, because he stole
John Wick's car, sir...

115
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,722
and, uh, killed his dog.

116
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,285
Oh.

Yeah?

119
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,484
They've agreed to your terms.

120
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,087
It's not like you gave them
much of a choice anyway though, right?

121
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,764
Congratulations.

122
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,571
Sir?

123
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,162
Have you seen my son?

124
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,124
How was your trip, kid?

125
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,680
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.

126
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,285
Or ever.

127
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,288
That's a nice jacket.

128
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,725
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

129
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,644
Ugh.

130
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,646
Should I go?

131
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,566
Nyet

132
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,405
- Viggo, English, please. Come on.
- Stay, goddamn it!

133
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,324
What did I do?

134
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,162
We did what you asked. No one saw shit.

135
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,806
I'm not talking about Atlantic City.

136
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,684
What then?

137
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,923
You mean Aurelio's?
So I stole a fucking car!

138
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,331
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

139
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,209
- Christ, Viggo.
- You stay!

140
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,411
It's not what you did, son,
that angers me so.

141
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,403
It's who you did it to.

142
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,131
Who? That fucking nobody?

143
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,962
That “fuckin' nobody”...

144
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,445
is John Wick.

145
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,411
<i>He once was an associate of ours.</i>

146
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,561
<i>They</i> call <i>him Baba Yaga.</i>

147
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,891
The boogeyman?

148
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,128
Well, John wasn't exactly the boogeyman.

149
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,161
He was the one you sent to kill
the fucking boogeyman.

150
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,771
Oh.

151
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,525
John is a man of focus...

152
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,846
commitment...

153
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,965
sheer will.

154
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,170
Something you know very little about.

155
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,207
I once saw him kill three men in a bar...

156
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,691
with a pencil.

157
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,486
With a fuckin'...

158
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,324
pencil.

159
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,361
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.

160
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,882
It's over a woman, of course.

161
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,688
<i>So I made a deal with him.</i>

162
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,851
I gave him an impossible task.

163
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,202
A job no one could have pulled off.

164
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,364
The bodies he buried that day...

165
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,643
laid the foundation of what we are now.

166
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,730
And then, my son...

167
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,366
a few days after his wife died...

168
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,931
you steal his car...

169
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,886
and kill his fuckin' dog.

170
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,930
Father, I can make this right.

171
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,810
Oh. How do you plan that?

172
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,803
By finishing what I started.

173
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,008
Did he hear a fucking word I said?

174
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,046
Iosef, Iosef, listen.

175
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,282
John will come for you.

176
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,690
<i>And you will do nothing...</i>

177
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,808
because you can do nothing.

178
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,531
So get the fuck out of my sight.

179
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,250
<i>Hello, John.</i>

180
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,561
I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry.

181
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,165
My condolences.

182
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,770
<i>It seems to be fate, or happenstance...</i>

183
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,925
<i>or just bad fuckin' luck
caused our paths to cross once again.</i>

184
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,164
John?

185
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,447
Let us not resort to our baser instincts...

186
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,091
<i>and handle this like civilized men...</i>

187
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,929
<i>to move on-</i>

188
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,284
What'd he say?

189
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,646
Enough.

190
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,967
Oh, God.

191
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,730
Task a crew.

192
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,451
H-How many?

193
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,040
How many do you have?

194
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,202
<i>Baba Yaga.</i>

195
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,211
Evenin', John.

196
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,408
Evenin', Jimmy.

197
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,084
Noise complaint?

198
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,169
Noise complaint.

199
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,411
You, uh, workin' again?

200
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,926
No, just sortin' some stuff out.

201
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,888
Ah, well...

202
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,961
I'll leave you be then.

203
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,520
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Jimmy.

204
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,680
This is Wick.

205
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,922
Yes, John Wick. That's right.

206
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,209
I'd like to make
a dinner reservation for 12.

207
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,963
Good to see you, John.

208
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,610
Charlie.

209
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,327
You look good.

210
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,449
And here I'd feared
you'd left all this behind.

211
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,524
Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon?

212
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,888
Good-bye, Charlie.

213
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,968
John.

214
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,923
Of course he did.

215
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,731
Put a contract on John Wick.

216
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,404
How much?

217
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,562
Two million.

218
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,483
English, Viggo, please.

219
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,204
Put losef in the Red Circle and wait.

220
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,291
For what?

221
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,125
For John Wick, of course.

222
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,604
Thank you.

223
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,120
To what do I owe this visit?

224
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,645
I have a job for you.

225
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,324
And I've got a phone.

226
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,562
Hmm.

227
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,291
I want to offer you this face to face...

228
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,881
seeing as how you might find it personal.

229
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,205
Would you kill John Wick
for two million dollars?

230
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,520
After all, you were close.

231
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,681
- Is the contract exclusive?
- No, it's open.

232
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,764
It's a timely matter.
It has to be handled quickly.

233
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,369
Consider it done.

234
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,009
Thank you, Marcus.
I know I can trust you.

235
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,730
Thanks for the drink.

I have you for two nights.

261
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,490
- Depending on business, it may be more.
- Of course, sir.

262
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,683
So when did the old place get a face lift?

263
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,205
Around four years ago.

264
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,645
But I assure you, sir...

265
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,643

A talk, you say.

285

I'm familiar with the parlance, Jonathan.

286
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,126
I want to ask you this.

287
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,202
Have you returned to the fold?

288
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,647
Just visiting.

289
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,768
Have you thought this through?

290
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,731
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

291
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,241
You got out once.

292
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,324
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond...

293
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,281
you may well find something reaches out...

294
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,840
and drags you back into its depths.

295
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,968
Where do I find him?

296

Welcome home, John.

298
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,924
We have a contact there
who's willing to take him out for us.

299
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,650
Yeah?

300
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,484
How brazen.

301
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,720
If they're willing to break the rules of
Continental, double the bounty.

302
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,201
You know the rules.

304

333
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,761
Are you scared of the fuckin' boogeyman?

334
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,842
- I'm not.
- No?

335
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,241
But you should be.

336
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,884
I want another bottle!

337
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,003
Right fuckin' now!
Go get me a bottle!

338
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,690
Come on!

339
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,644
Hello, Francis.

340
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,249
Mr. Wick.

341
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,801
Are you here on business, sir?

342
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,324
Afraid so, Francis.

343
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,045
Why don't you take the night off.

344
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,811
Thank you, sir.

345
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,525
Fuck you, motherfucker.

346
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,805
Where is Iosef?

347
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,281
Bathhouse, downstairs.

348
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,246
Go!

349
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,125
Move! He's here! He's fucking here!
He's there! He's coming!

350
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,528
Get in!
Get in!

351
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,090
Come on!
Come on!

352
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,884
Good evening, Mr. Wick.

353
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,961
Good evening.

354
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,565
How may I be of service?

355
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,564
- Is the doctor in?
- Yes, sir. 24/7.

356
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,523
- Send him up, please.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,130
How good's your laundry?

358
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,970
I'm sorry to say that no one's <i>that</i> good.

359
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,411
No. I thought not.

360
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,290
May I suggest a drink, sir.

361
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,925
Bourbon, perhaps.

362
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,049
That sounds perfect.

363
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,766
So what sort of movement am I looking at?

364
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,486
Well, if you're lookin' to heal...

365
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,085
then keep it marginal.

366
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,486
However, if you still have...

367
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,881
business to attend to...

368
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,962
uh...

369
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,441
take two of these beforehand.

370
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,201
Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed...

371
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,005
but you'll have full function.

372
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,003
Do you need anything for the pain?

373
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,602
No, I've got that covered.

374
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,681
Hey, John.

375
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,526
- Perkins?
- I thought I'd let myself in.

376
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,089
I noticed.

377
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,370
I never knew Ms. Perkins
to get out of bed for less than three.

378
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,283
Viggo's giving me four
to break hotel rules.

379
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,806
That's unwise, I assure you.

380
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,689
You were always a pussy.

381
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,931
Yes?

382
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,606
<i>I apologize for calling you
at this hour...</i>

383
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,321
but we have received
a number of grievances from your floor...

384
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,129
concerning the noise.

385
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,611
My apologies.

386
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,526
I was dealing with an uninvited guest.

387
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,364
<i>Have you need then of, say...</i>

388
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,608
a dinner reservation, perhaps?

389
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,968
Perhaps. <i>I'll</i> have to get back to you.

390
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,482
No! Aah!

391
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,164
Where's Iosef?

392
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,571
Fuck you.

393
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,962
- Where's Viggo?
- I'm not telling you shit!

394
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,691
Do you really wanna die here, Perkins?

395
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,162
Give me somethin'.

396
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,570
Little Russia.

397
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,445
There's a church near Cannon Court.

398
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,330
<i>- What about it?
- It's a front.</i>

399
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,846
It's where Viggo keeps his private stash.

400
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,002
Thank you.

401
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,843
Do I know you?

402
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,288
I'm thinkin' so.

403
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,610
Hey, John.

404
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,444
Hey, Harry.

405
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,124
Everything all right?

406
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,000
Yeah. Everything's fine.

407
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,209
- I'll leave you to it then.
- Hey, Harry.

408
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,247
You keen on earning a coin?
Babysittin' the sleepin' one?

409
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,164
- Catch and release?
- Catch and release.

410
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,207
My son, how might I help you?

411
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,251
Motherfucker!

412
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,808
Let's go to the vault.

413
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,891
Open it.

414
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,125
Viggo will kill me.

415
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,809
Uh-huh.

416
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,804
Ladies, out.

417
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,645
Honestly, what do you think
you're going to do with all of that?

418
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,001
This.

419
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,645
Don't worry.

420
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,451
Housekeeping will find you.

421
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,522
Treat all your ladies like this?

422
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,809
You are no lady. Trust me.

423
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,721
Harry, is it?

424
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,723
How would you like to earn
more than just a gold coin?

425
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,089
You've broken the rules.

426
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,164
You've done business
on Continental grounds.

427
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,771
And management does not take kindly...

428
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,922
to that sort of behavior.

429
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,601
Fuck management.

430
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,206
Don't worry. Housekeeping'll find you.

431
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,450
Ashes to ashes.

432
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,886
- Can we recover from this?
- Viggo, you know what was in that vault, right?

433
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,883
Shit.

434
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,801
Come on!

435
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,930
I'll say this, John.

436
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,890
They sure as fuck broke the mold with you.

437
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,409
Ay-yi.

438
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,650
You always had a certain...

439
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,371
audacity about you, you know.

440
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,568
Yeah.

441
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:18,771
I can say you're still very much
the John Wick of old.

442
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,250
Am I?

443
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,166
People don't change. You know that.

444
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,402
Times, they do.

445
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,408
Do you know what was in that vault?

446
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,528
Artwork, cash, not without its worth.

447
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,046
But the leverage I had on this city-

448
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,165
audio recordings,
physical evidence, blackmail-

449
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,765
it was fuckin' priceless!

450
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,285
Priceless!

451
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,611
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.

452
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,523
Yeah.

453
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,604
Yeah, I know you did. Yeah.

454
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,364
Are you really laughing?

455
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,964
So-

456
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,447
Ah, then you got married, huh?
Settled down.

457
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:21,091
How did you manage that anyways?

458
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,804
Luck, l guess.

459
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,007
Yeah.

460
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,090
Yeah, while you had your wife,
I had my son.

461
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,130
And believe me, you had a far better deal.

462
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,085
And then you left.

463
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,561
And the way you got out...

464
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:47,010
lying to yourself that
the past held no sway over the future.

465
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,844
But in the end...

466
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,242
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds...

467
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,166
which is why God took your wife...

468
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,331
and unleashed you upon me.

469
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,651
This life...

470
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,722
follows you.

471
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,011
It clings to you...

472
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:19,325
infecting everyone who comes close to you.

473
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,370
We are cursed, you and I.

474
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,202
On that we agree.

475
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,247
Finally, common ground.

476
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,969
Okay-

477
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,724
Step aside.

478
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,406
Give me your son.

479
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,689
John Wick.

480
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,802
It was just a fucking car.
Just a fuckin' dog.

481
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,848
Just a dog.

482
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,650
Viggo.

483
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,205
Yeah?

484
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,521
When Helen died, I lost everything.

485
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,844
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep-

486
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,730
a final gift from my wife.

487
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,930
In that moment, I received
some semblance of hope...

488
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,084
an opportunity to grieve unalone.

489
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,446
And your son...

490
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,170
took that from me.

491
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,329
- Oh, God.
- Stole that from me.

492
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,290
Killed that from me!

493
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,840
People keep asking if I'm back...

494
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,605
and I haven't really had an answer.

495
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:39,127
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back.

496
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,409
So you can either hand over your son-

497
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,609
Or you can die screaming alongside him!

498
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,088
Cool it. Cool it.

499
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,491
John!

500
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,122
- Aah! Jesus.
- Where is he?

501
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,564
Shit!

502
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,364
I have your word then, if I tell you where
he is, that you'll let me walk away?

503
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,970
Pull the contract.

504
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,610
Done.

505
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,371
He's kept in a safe house. Brooklyn.

434 Wallace Place.

507

01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,888
You made a new life.

You'll find your way back to it.

543

545
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,444
Hello, Marcus.

546
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,205
This is John.

547
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,809
I appreciate you granting my son
a swift death.

548
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,010
<i>I wouldn't know
how to reply to that either.</i>

549
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,121
Marcus betrayed me.

550
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,121
You pulled the contract.

551
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:46,888
And while it was open,
you had every chance...

552
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,123
every opportunity to kill John Wick.

553
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,483
And if you had done your job...

554
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,801
my son would be still alive!

555
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,164
<i>And in so doing...</i>

556

557
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,930
Thank you.

I always liked you, Marcus.

563
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,407
The last of the old guard.

564
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,445
Oh-

565
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,171
But unlike the others,
you go out on my terms.

566
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,687
Aah! No! No!

567
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,603
No, my good sir.

568
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,082
I go out on my own.
