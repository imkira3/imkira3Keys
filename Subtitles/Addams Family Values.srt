Hi. Addams residence?

Hi! Hi. I'm Debbie Jellinsky

The agency?

But they claimed
no one else was available.

Oh, no.
This is our baby.

He's adorable. He's perfect.
What's his name?

202
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,089
It was agony.

as the Black Widow.

never lasts.

00:46:24,226 --> 00:46:26,821
We'll be just like
Gomez and Morticia.

849
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:30,096
Pretend we're
at home in my room--

850
00:46:30,168 --> 00:46:31,966
Granny down the hallway,

851
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:33,700
Lurch by the door.

852
00:46:33,774 --> 00:46:35,710
Oh, my God.

853
00:46:35,778 --> 00:46:37,406
Please, what is it?

854
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:39,177
What do you need?

855
00:46:43,223 --> 00:46:46,786
Only you, my dearest.

856
00:46:50,568 --> 00:46:52,093
Really?

857
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,538
Fester, I'm ready.

858
00:46:56,544 --> 00:46:59,378
- Just one thing...
- Gomez told me. No giggling.

859
00:46:59,448 --> 00:47:01,007
- And?
- No hand puppets.

860
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,985
- And...
- What?

861
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:04,784
after we've made love,

862
00:47:04,857 --> 00:47:07,759
you can never see
your family again.

863
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:09,023
What?

864
00:47:09,097 --> 00:47:12,626
Otherwise, I could never
really enjoy myself.

865
00:47:12,703 --> 00:47:16,038
I could never
give myself completely.

866
00:47:16,108 --> 00:47:19,273
Unless I never see
my family again?

867
00:47:19,347 --> 00:47:22,477
Yes. If I picture them
in our lives,

868
00:47:22,552 --> 00:47:25,785
I could never achieve...
you know.

Don't you love me?

871
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,194
Of course.

It's so odd we haven't heard
from Fester and Debbie.

Be careful!
It's a credenza!

Don't touch it,
not until the scab falls off.

Pumpkin, do you think
these clothes are really me?

Of course not.
That's the point.

He can't be serious.

Have I done something,

Why does my brother
despise me?

He adores you.

I'd do anything for him.

938

At his request,
I would rip out my eyes.

939

At his command,
I would crawl on my belly

and broken glass.

Post-honeymoon malaise.

945

00:54:39,814 --> 00:54:41,373
Might we see my brother?

1016
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:46,185
No. He doesn't want to see
any of you or that.

1017
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:47,316
Why not?

1018
00:54:47,392 --> 00:54:49,293
Because he's in love.

1019
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:51,696
He's wrapped in a gossamer
blanket of ecstasy,

1020
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:53,530
and he hates your guts.

1021
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:54,865
But why?

1022
00:54:54,937 --> 00:54:56,804
Because you've
flaunted yourselves,

1023
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,003
your great love affair.

1024
00:54:59,078 --> 00:55:01,547
You kept him a child.

1025
00:55:01,615 --> 00:55:03,447
I've made him a man.

1026
00:55:03,518 --> 00:55:06,011
Let me hear this
from his own lips.

1027
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:08,490
His lips are busy.

1028
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,586
You want to talk
to these people?

1029
00:55:10,663 --> 00:55:11,630
Debbie.

1030
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:16,671
Oh.

1031
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:17,729
Go away!

1032
00:55:17,807 --> 00:55:19,742
That is not my brother.

1033
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,005
Sorry.

1034
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:22,911
You have
enslaved him.

1035
00:55:22,982 --> 00:55:24,848
You have
placed Fester

1036
00:55:24,919 --> 00:55:26,581
under some strange
sexual spell.

1037
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:30,058
I respect that.
But, please, may we see him?

1038
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:31,755
Don't even
think about it.

1039
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,354
You have gone
too far.

1040
00:55:33,432 --> 00:55:34,923
You have
married Fester.

1041
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:36,492
You have destroyed
his spirit.

1042
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:39,097
You have taken him
from us.

1043
00:55:39,174 --> 00:55:40,665
All that
I could forgive.

1044
00:55:40,743 --> 00:55:42,041
But, Debbie...

1045
00:55:42,112 --> 00:55:43,512
What?

1046
00:55:44,783 --> 00:55:45,910
Pastels?

1047
00:55:45,985 --> 00:55:48,147
Get out of my house!

1048
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:50,053
Hit the road!

1049
00:55:50,124 --> 00:55:53,357
And if you ever
show your faces around here again,

1050
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:57,335
I'll have you locked up
for trying to visit.

1051
00:55:57,403 --> 00:55:58,529
Right, Fessie?

1052
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,573
Right!

1053
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:13,321
Luxor, nexor,
burst, and burn!

1054
00:56:13,395 --> 00:56:15,261
What is she doing?

1055
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:17,961
Just a curse.
Have a nice day.

1056
00:56:22,776 --> 00:56:24,973
I demand justice!

1057
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:27,346
Someone has married
my brother.

1058
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,851
No.

1059
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:30,751
She took him to Hawaii.

1060
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:33,884
They have moved into
a large, expensive home

1061
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:35,759
where they make love
constantly.

1062
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,560
I hate
when that happens.

1063
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:39,568
Arrest her at once
without delay.

1064
00:56:39,636 --> 00:56:41,571
- Who?
- Debbie.

1065
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:45,703
My brother's wife,
the temptress of Waikiki.

1066
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,974
Who are you?

1067
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:49,484
What are you?
Who moved the rock?

1068
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:51,544
Officer,
you must issue a subpoena.

1069
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:53,591
I believe they own...

1070
00:56:53,658 --> 00:56:54,683
Gomez, no!

1071
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,693
A Buick!

1072
00:56:55,762 --> 00:56:57,788
Just leave.
Leave quietly. Leave now.

1073
00:56:57,865 --> 00:57:01,098
Don't make me call
Ringling Brothers.

1074
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,966
Has the planet gone mad?

1075
00:57:06,713 --> 00:57:08,682
My brother... passion's hostage.

1076
00:57:08,749 --> 00:57:10,377
I seek justice.

1077
00:57:10,452 --> 00:57:12,182
Denied.

1078
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:17,058
I shall not submit.
I shall conquer. I shall rise.

1079
00:57:17,129 --> 00:57:22,536
My name is Gomez Addams,
and I have seen evil!

1080
00:57:22,604 --> 00:57:24,505
I have seen horror!

1081
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,437
I have seen
the unholy maggots

1082
00:57:29,515 --> 00:57:34,148
which feast in the dark recesses
of the human soul!

1083
00:57:34,223 --> 00:57:35,714
They're at camp.

1084
00:57:35,792 --> 00:57:38,455
I have seen all this,
Officer.

1085
00:57:38,529 --> 00:57:40,395
But until today,

1086
00:57:40,466 --> 00:57:43,868
I had never seen...

1087
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:46,732
you!

1088
00:57:47,811 --> 00:57:52,341
Hook him, book him,
cook him. Now!

1089
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:54,250
Next in line.

1090
00:57:54,321 --> 00:57:56,847
Yes, I'd like to renew
my passport, please.

1091
00:57:56,925 --> 00:57:58,985
I'll be leaving the country
very shortly.

1092
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:00,324
Traveling alone?

1093
00:58:00,397 --> 00:58:03,459
Yes. I'll be a widow.

1094
00:58:08,043 --> 00:58:10,012
~ Happy, happy turkey day ~

1095
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,241
~ Hunger pains will go away ~

1096
00:58:12,316 --> 00:58:13,841
~ When you hear
the pilgrims say ~

1097
00:58:13,919 --> 00:58:15,979
~ It's happy turkey day ~

1098
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:17,956
~ Happy, happy turkey day ~

1099
00:58:18,025 --> 00:58:20,427
~ Let's all eat
the Indian way ~

1100
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:22,488
~ As Bastille
and Cape Cod day ~

1101
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:25,765
~ On happy turkey day ~~

1102
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:30,869
Look at you.
Oh, Amanda, you look perfect!

1103
00:58:30,946 --> 00:58:34,281
You're just the prettiest pilgrim
I've ever seen!

1104
00:58:34,351 --> 00:58:36,912
Gar, come and take
a look at this.

1105
00:58:36,988 --> 00:58:38,479
Here they are!

1106
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:40,025
They were
by the phone.

1107
00:58:40,093 --> 00:58:41,584
We were calling the FBI.

1108
00:58:41,662 --> 00:58:43,153
Their uncle's in trouble.

1109
00:58:43,232 --> 00:58:45,360
You're late for your fittings.

1110
00:58:45,435 --> 00:58:47,667
I don't want to be
in the pageant.

1111
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:50,368
You won't help me
realize my vision?

1112
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,005
Your work is puerile
and under-dramatized.

1113
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:55,880
You lack any sense
of structure, character,

1114
00:58:55,951 --> 00:58:57,783
or the Aristotelian unities.

1115
00:58:57,854 --> 00:59:00,416
Young lady,
I am getting just a tad tired

1116
00:59:00,492 --> 00:59:02,256
of your attitude problem.

1117
00:59:02,328 --> 00:59:04,456
Everyone, campers!

1118
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:07,195
I have a wonderful idea.

1119
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:10,435
Wednesday and Pugsley
and young Mr. Glicker here,

1120
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:13,638
well, they have just
never quite latched on

1121
00:59:13,713 --> 00:59:14,941
to the Chippewa spirit,

1122
00:59:15,015 --> 00:59:17,542
nor have some oftheir
little comrades.

1123
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:20,351
Isn't that sad?

1124
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:21,356
- Yes!
- Yes!

1125
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:22,893
Don't we just
hate that?

1126
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:23,894
- Yes!
- Yes!

1127
00:59:23,963 --> 00:59:25,829
Don't we wish
they'd just die?

1128
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:26,888
- Yes!
- Yes!

1129
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:28,196
We don't.

1130
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:31,331
But you know what
we'll do with them?

1131
00:59:31,408 --> 00:59:33,775
We're going to make
an example.

1132
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:36,508
We are going to show
that anyone,

1133
00:59:36,582 --> 00:59:39,644
no matter how odd
or pale or chubby,

1134
00:59:39,721 --> 00:59:42,783
can still have
a darn good time.

1135
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:44,885
Whether they
like it or not.

1136
00:59:44,963 --> 00:59:47,728
What are you going to do?

1137
00:59:48,902 --> 00:59:50,996
Yes, indeedy,
just the ticket.

1138
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:52,233
Bambi.

1139
00:59:52,307 --> 00:59:54,503
Lassie Come Home.

1140
00:59:54,577 --> 00:59:56,547
The Little Mermaid.

1141
00:59:56,614 --> 00:59:57,581
Stop it.

1142
00:59:57,649 --> 00:59:59,743
He's only a child.

1143
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:04,788
Don't worry.
We're getting out of here.

1144
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,989
But...

1145
01:00:07,064 --> 01:00:08,760
it's Disney.

1146
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:10,233
Yes.

1147
01:00:13,474 --> 01:00:16,445
~ The hillsare alive ~

1148
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:21,145
~ With the sound of music ~

1149
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,621
~ With songs they have sung ~

1150
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,488
~ For a thousand years... ~~

1151
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:29,828
~ And they knew that it was
much more than a hunch ~

1152
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,303
~ That this group must
somehow form a family ~

1153
01:00:33,372 --> 01:00:36,866
~ That's the way we all
became the BradyBunch... ~~

1154
01:00:36,944 --> 01:00:41,042
~ You're always a day ~

1155
01:00:41,117 --> 01:00:46,559
~ A-way ~~

1156
01:00:58,813 --> 01:01:00,007
Well...

1157
01:01:00,081 --> 01:01:02,278
good evening.

1158
01:01:02,351 --> 01:01:04,718
Is there anything
you'd like to say to everyone?

1159
01:01:04,788 --> 01:01:06,017
Yes.

1160
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:09,153
And just what
might that be?

1161
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:14,800
I'm not perky.

1162
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:17,396
That's for damn sure.

1163
01:01:17,476 --> 01:01:19,570
But I want to be.

1164
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,109
You do?

1165
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:24,014
I want to smile

1166
01:01:24,085 --> 01:01:26,988
and sing and dance

1167
01:01:27,057 --> 01:01:29,526
and be Pocahontas
in Gary's vision.

1168
01:01:29,595 --> 01:01:32,827
Oh, darling,
do you really mean it?

1169
01:01:50,394 --> 01:01:51,554
- [Gasps]
- [Gasps]

1170
01:01:51,629 --> 01:01:53,325
Isn't she pretty?

1171
01:01:53,398 --> 01:01:55,094
She's scaring me!

1172
01:01:55,168 --> 01:01:56,227
Oh, Gar.

1173
01:01:56,303 --> 01:01:57,271
Yeah.

1174
01:01:59,642 --> 01:02:01,838
Aah!

1175
01:02:01,912 --> 01:02:03,312
Stay back!

1176
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:06,011
He's very sick.

1342
01:11:15,975 --> 01:11:17,807
~ Feel my muscles ~

1343
01:11:17,878 --> 01:11:20,872
~ I've got to be a macho man ~

1344
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:24,580
~ Mucho, mucho, macho, macho ~

1345
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,521
~ I got to be a macho ~

1346
01:11:26,591 --> 01:11:28,890
~ Hey, hey, hey, hey ~

1347
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:32,091
Hey! Wait!
What time is it, Jorge?

1348
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,601
Ah, 6:25.

1349
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:35,661
Oops. Got to go.

1350
01:11:35,739 --> 01:11:37,766
- No!
- Wait!

1351
01:11:37,843 --> 01:11:40,506
Wait here.
It's my anniversary.

1352
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,878
I'll be right back.

1353
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:44,248
Your husband
is a very lucky man.

1354
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:46,482
Don't say that!

1355
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:48,116
~ Hey, hey, hey ~

1356
01:11:48,193 --> 01:11:51,790
~ Hey, macho, macho man ~

1357
01:11:51,865 --> 01:11:55,030
~ I got to be a macho man ~~

1358

[Ticking]

1359
01:11:59,176 --> 01:12:01,008
Cheers.

1360
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:03,014
Oh, no, no.

1361
01:12:16,937 --> 01:12:19,840
But, Officer...

1362
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:23,039
my husband
was in that house.

1363
01:12:27,387 --> 01:12:29,516
[Laughing]

1364
01:12:41,075 --> 01:12:45,139
Happy anniversary, Debbie.

1365
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,712
Help. Help.

1366
01:13:38,433 --> 01:13:41,996
Sweetheart!
Did you get the champagne?

1367
01:13:42,072 --> 01:13:43,232
Freeze!

1368
01:13:45,544 --> 01:13:47,206
Pookie?

1369
01:13:47,281 --> 01:13:50,183
I tried to make it
look like an accident.

1370
01:13:50,252 --> 01:13:52,414
I tried to give you some dignity,
but, oh, no, not you.

1371
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:54,651
What are you saying?

1372
01:13:54,725 --> 01:13:58,094
I want you dead,
and I want your money.

1373
01:13:58,164 --> 01:14:00,828
But--But...
don't you love me?

1374
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:06,673
Is that a no?

1375
01:14:06,744 --> 01:14:09,510
Oh, do I love you.
Look at yourself!

1376
01:14:09,582 --> 01:14:12,143
You're a nightmare.
You're the missing link.

1377
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:14,689
You shouldn't be married.
You should be studied.

1378
01:14:14,757 --> 01:14:17,283
You're a big,
dumb, weird thing.

1379
01:14:17,361 --> 01:14:20,594
No woman in her right mind
could love you.

1380
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:21,656
Yeow!

1381
01:14:21,735 --> 01:14:23,670
Thing!

1382
01:14:34,788 --> 01:14:38,351
I'll get you!
And your little hand, too!

1383
01:14:42,534 --> 01:14:44,526
Aah!

1384
01:15:12,581 --> 01:15:13,879
Come on.

1385
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:17,012
No. I have to go back.
For the others.

1386
01:15:17,089 --> 01:15:18,250
You're very brave.

1387
01:15:18,324 --> 01:15:21,453
And to watch the place burn.
You go.

1388
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:23,122
Save your uncle.

1389
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:25,395
I may never
see you again.

1390
01:15:25,469 --> 01:15:26,595
I know.

1391
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:28,503
There are forces
tearing us apart--

1392
01:15:28,574 --> 01:15:32,012
Gary, Debbie,
seventh grade.

1393
01:15:34,883 --> 01:15:36,408
I'll never forget you.

1394
01:15:36,486 --> 01:15:37,681
You won't?

1395
01:15:37,755 --> 01:15:39,656
You're too weird.

1396
01:15:39,724 --> 01:15:42,718
We'll always have today
and Chippewa.

1397
01:15:42,796 --> 01:15:44,162
And this.

1398
01:15:46,402 --> 01:15:48,371
What is it?

1399
01:15:48,438 --> 01:15:49,929
Amanda's retainer.

1400
01:15:51,276 --> 01:15:52,504
Cara mia.

1401
01:15:52,579 --> 01:15:54,275
Mon cher.

1402
01:16:01,559 --> 01:16:02,925
[Honking]

1403
01:16:02,995 --> 01:16:04,121
Come on!

1404
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:22,589
Move it!

1405
01:16:25,297 --> 01:16:26,594
Move out of the way!

1406
01:16:33,242 --> 01:16:35,302
"We looked,

1407
01:16:35,379 --> 01:16:39,148
"then we saw him
step in on the mat.

1408
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:42,520
"We looked,
and we saw him--

1409
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:45,857
the cat in the hat."

1410
01:16:45,929 --> 01:16:48,058
Are you enjoying this?

1411
01:16:49,402 --> 01:16:52,304
To think...

1412
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:54,204
a child of mine.

1413
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:58,106
"I know it is wet,

1414
01:16:58,182 --> 01:17:00,845
"and the sun is not sunny,

1415
01:17:00,919 --> 01:17:04,220
"but we can have
lots of good fun,

1416
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,816
that is funny."

1417
01:17:12,972 --> 01:17:15,374
Oh, no.

1418
01:17:15,443 --> 01:17:17,241
He lives.

1419
01:17:17,312 --> 01:17:19,907
Come on! It's Gomez!

1420
01:17:21,118 --> 01:17:24,419
~ Swing low ~

1421
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:27,893
~ Sweet chariot ~

1422
01:17:27,962 --> 01:17:33,460
~ Coming for
to carry me home ~

1423
01:17:33,537 --> 01:17:36,099
~ Swing low ~~

1424
01:17:36,175 --> 01:17:38,804
My baby is ill,

1425
01:17:38,879 --> 01:17:41,041
and my husband
is dying.

1426
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:45,481
Oh, mama,
what shall I do?

1427
01:17:45,556 --> 01:17:48,391
Well, you have
a black dress.

1428
01:17:59,845 --> 01:18:00,835
Gomez!

1429
01:18:00,914 --> 01:18:02,143
- Fester!
- Fester!

1430
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:04,048
Fester? Where is Fester?

1431
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:05,610
He's right here,
mon cher.

1432
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:08,922
It's me, Gomez.

1433
01:18:08,994 --> 01:18:11,964
I've tried to be
someone I'm not.

1434
01:18:12,031 --> 01:18:14,126
I live in shame...

1435
01:18:14,202 --> 01:18:15,932
and the suburbs!

1436
01:18:16,005 --> 01:18:18,031
But you belong to Debbie.

1437
01:18:18,108 --> 01:18:20,772
You're Debbie's love toy.

1438
01:18:20,846 --> 01:18:25,547
You are Mr. Debbie!

1439
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:27,520
I am an Addams!

1440
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:29,286
Fester!

1441
01:18:33,032 --> 01:18:34,466
Uncle Fester!

1442
01:18:34,534 --> 01:18:36,230
Children!

1443
01:18:39,776 --> 01:18:41,540
You sent us to camp.

1444
01:18:43,013 --> 01:18:44,413
They made us sing.

1445
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:53,863
My own dear family.

1446
01:18:57,737 --> 01:19:00,172
How I've missed you all.

1447
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:04,874
Our whole family--
together at last.

1448
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,917
Three generations...

1449
01:19:06,985 --> 01:19:08,647
above ground.

1450
01:19:08,721 --> 01:19:10,030
In-laws!

1451
01:19:16,907 --> 01:19:19,275
I don't want
to hurt anybody.

1452
01:19:19,345 --> 01:19:21,814
I don't enjoy
hurting anybody.

1453
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:26,082
I don't like guns or bombs
or electric chairs,

1454
01:19:26,156 --> 01:19:28,387
but sometimes
people just won't listen,

1455
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:31,224
and so I have to use
persuasion...

1456
01:19:31,298 --> 01:19:33,062
and slides.

1457
01:19:33,134 --> 01:19:35,968
My parents--
Sharon and Dave.

1458
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:37,631
Generous, doting...

1459
01:19:37,707 --> 01:19:39,505
or were they?

1460
01:19:39,576 --> 01:19:44,016
All I ever wanted
was a ballerina Barbie

1461
01:19:44,084 --> 01:19:46,178
in her pretty pink tutu.

1462
01:19:46,254 --> 01:19:47,654
My birthday.

1463
01:19:47,723 --> 01:19:49,123
I was 10,

1464
01:19:49,192 --> 01:19:52,095
and do you know
what they got me?

1465
01:19:52,164 --> 01:19:55,533
Malibu Barbie.

1466
01:19:55,602 --> 01:19:57,298
Malibu Barbie.

1467
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:58,498
The nightmare.

1468
01:19:58,573 --> 01:19:59,734
The nerve.

1469
01:19:59,809 --> 01:20:02,176
That's not
what I wanted.

1470
01:20:02,245 --> 01:20:04,272
That's not who I was.

1471
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:06,819
I was a ballerina--

1472
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:10,153
graceful, delicate.

1473
01:20:10,225 --> 01:20:12,023
They had to go.

1474
01:20:28,019 --> 01:20:31,218
My first husband,
the heart surgeon.

1475
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:34,262
All day long,
coronaries, transplants.

1476
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,958
What about your needs?

1477
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:38,628
"Sorry about dinner, Deb.

1478
01:20:38,704 --> 01:20:40,400
The pope has a cold."

1479
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:43,942
An axe.

1480
01:20:44,012 --> 01:20:46,311
That takes me back.

1481
01:21:03,576 --> 01:21:06,172
Husband number two--
the senator.

1482
01:21:06,247 --> 01:21:09,149
He loved his state.
He loved his country.

1483
01:21:09,218 --> 01:21:11,211
What about Debbie?

1484
01:21:11,289 --> 01:21:14,487
"Sorry, Debbie.
No Mercedes this year.

1485
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,723
We have to set an example."

1486
01:21:16,797 --> 01:21:20,326
Oh, yeah? Set this!

1487
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:39,028
My latest husband.

1488
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:42,628
My late husband Fester.

1489
01:21:42,705 --> 01:21:44,173
The fool.

1490
01:21:44,241 --> 01:21:46,142
The corpse.

1491
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:48,941
And his adorable family.

1492
01:21:49,014 --> 01:21:52,383
You took me in.
You accepted me.

1493
01:21:52,453 --> 01:21:55,947
But did any of you love me?

1494
01:21:56,026 --> 01:21:57,357
Really love me?

1495
01:21:57,427 --> 01:21:59,225
Hands.

1496
01:22:14,021 --> 01:22:15,853
So I--I killed.

1497
01:22:15,924 --> 01:22:17,722
So I maimed.

1498
01:22:17,793 --> 01:22:23,029
So I destroyed one
innocent life after another.

1499
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:26,595
Aren't I a human being?

1500
01:22:26,674 --> 01:22:32,378
Don't I yearn and...
ache and shop?

1501
01:22:33,585 --> 01:22:38,855
Don't I deserve love...

1502
01:22:40,362 --> 01:22:42,331
and jewelry?

1503
01:23:06,036 --> 01:23:07,664
Adieu, mon cher.

1504
01:23:07,739 --> 01:23:09,537
Adios, cara mia.

1505
01:23:09,608 --> 01:23:13,513
Debbie, let them go.
Take me and my money.

1506
01:23:13,582 --> 01:23:15,710
For what I've done,
