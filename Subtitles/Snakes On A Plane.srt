1
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,435
# All I see
are sunny skies #

2
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,944
# Every time I look
into your eyes #

3
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,752
# Here we go again,
my friend #

4
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:52,083
# Staying together
till the end #

5
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,719
# It's gonna be #

6
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:56,786
# A lovely day #

7
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,196
# It's gonna be #

8
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:01,257
# A lovely day #

9
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:03,895
# It's gonna be #

10
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:05,905
# A lovely day #

11
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,305
# It's gonna be #

12
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:11,833
# A lovely day #

13
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:23,147
# Being out
in the open air #

14
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,359
# Living life
like we just don't care #

15
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:32,362
# Just doing what
we want to do #

16
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:37,101
# Not doing
what we're supposed to #

17
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,435
# It's gonna be #

18
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:41,600
# A lovely day #

19
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:44,166
# It's gonna be #

20
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:46,111
# A lovely day #

21
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:48,114
# It's gonna be #

22
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:50,776
# A lovely day #

23
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:53,183
# It's gonna be #

24
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,688
# A lovely day #

25
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,749
# We'll just float #

26
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,727
# On top
of the clouds #

27
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:04,754
# That cover
our skies #

28
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:07,767
# I said,
we'll just float #

29
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:10,668
# On top
of the clouds #

30
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:13,764
# That cover
our skies #

31
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:16,708
# I said,
we'll just fly #

32
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:19,837
# On top
of the clouds #

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,283
# That cover
our skies instead #

34
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:00,145
# It's gonna be #

35
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:02,212
# A lovely day #

36
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:04,723
# It's gonna be #

37
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,726
# A lovely day #

38
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,320
# It's gonna be #

39
00:03:09,362 --> 00:03:11,330
# A lovely day #

40
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:13,723
# It's gonna be #

41
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:17,134
# A lovely day. #

42
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:35,345
Go, get outta here.

43
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:38,221
Go!

44
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:57,604
They say the higher
you aim,

45
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:59,805
the farther
you fall.

46
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:02,474
Fuck you, Eddie Kim.

47
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:06,212
And look at you now,
Mr. Prosecutor, huh?

48
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:08,653
Not so high
and mighty anymore.

49
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:14,794
Well, that's
a noble gesture.

50
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:17,126
I'll make sure
to tell your son

51
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:19,131
all about it.

52
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:22,100
The reason he gets
to grow up without a father

53
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:25,161
is because of how
goddamn noble he was.

54
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:30,300
Then again, I was raised
by a single mom and...

55
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:36,449
I didn't turn out
so bad, huh? Whoo!

56
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:45,022
Clean this up.

57
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:46,958
I'm going back to LA.

58
00:04:57,804 --> 00:05:00,602
Let's get the hell out
of here...

59
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,369
and find that guy!

60
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:07,203
This is Mi Jung Lee
reporting live

61
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:08,714
from the Kaena Point area.

62
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:11,911
Details remain sketchy in
the brutal slaying yesterday

63
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:14,580
of Los Angeles prosecutor
Daniel Hayes,

64
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:17,317
who was vacationing
in Hawaii.

65
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:19,325
Hayes has been
in the news lately

66
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:22,954
for his high-profile pursuit of reputed
mobster Edward Kim.

67
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:25,590
Mr. Kim's representatives
have issued a statement

68
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:28,157
of condolences
to the Hayes family

69
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:30,169
and claim absolutely
no involvement

70
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:32,171
in what they call
a hideous act

71
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:34,571
of violence.
The ongoing saga

72
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:36,370
in the criminal
investigation

73
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,934
of Mr. Kim involves charges
of murder, racketeering

74
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,039
and police corruption
at the highest levels,

75
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:44,983
both here in Hawaii
and on the mainland.

76
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:46,849
Thank you, Mi Jung.

77
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,444
We'll be sure to check in
for any updates

78
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:51,013
as they become
available.

79
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,165
Do as I say,
and you live.

80
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,944
Stay flat against this wall.
Don't even breathe.

81
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:27,049
Go go go, that way!

82
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,158
Black car, go!

83
00:06:50,517 --> 00:06:52,007
What the hell is going on?

84
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:54,077
You witnessed a murder
and didn't tell anybody.

85
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,849
Why didn't you call
the police?

86
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,187
The news said they were corrupt,
so I figured they'd be in on it.

87
00:06:58,224 --> 00:06:59,953
Smart kid.

88
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:01,620
Who are you?

89
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:03,629
I'm Agent
Neville Flynn, FBI.

90
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:06,131
Pleased
to meet you, Sean.

91
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:22,040
I gotta tell you, Sean, I'm getting
a little tired of all this garbage

92
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:24,949
you've been feeding me.

93
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:26,952
We know you were there.
Your prints are all over it,

94
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:29,147
so stop insulting
my intelligence.

95
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:32,852
You witnessed a murder.
You have a responsibility.

96
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,525
Look here, Sean.

97
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,433
I've been doing this for a while,
so I know all kinds

98
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,599
of neat little
interrogation tricks.

99
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,165
You know, good cop
bad cop,

100
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,441
reverse psychology,
stare-down contests, threats.

101
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,938
You name it,
I've done it.

102
00:07:56,983 --> 00:07:59,247
But why don't we
leapfrog all that bullshit,

103
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:01,549
save ourselves a lot
of aggravation and time,

104
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:04,557
of which there is
close to zero,

105
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:07,685
and I tell you
the truth?

106
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:10,389
Truth is I'm not
worried about you

107
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,193
if you testify.

108
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:14,564
But I am worried
about you if you don't.

109
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,269
What-- what if I didn't see him clearly?
I mean, I wouldn't be--

110
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:25,744
What did I just tell you about saving us
aggravation and time?

111
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:28,269
He knows who you are!

112
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:30,805
That's why those people
were at your house trying to kill you.

113
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,977
And make no mistake,

114
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,614
Eddie Kim will kill you,

115
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:38,146
if you let him.

116
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:41,854
Last week I was planning
a surfing trip to Bali.

117
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:45,387
Now...

118
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,422
now you make it sound
like I have no choice--

119
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,901
Oh, no no no no no no no no no.
You got choices.

120
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:52,404
You got tons
of choices,

121
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:55,066
but there's only one
correct choice:

122
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:56,234
Come with us to LA,

123
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:58,710
testify against his ass,

124
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,713
put him in jail
for life.

125
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:03,215
Tell you what:

126
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:05,945
You sit here,
think about it.

127
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:09,148
You let us know
what you decide.

128
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:11,180
We'll be outside.

129
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:27,168
The white zone is for
immediate in-loading

130
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:30,074
and unloading
of passengers only.

131
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:32,839
So you got any requests
for your final flight?

132
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,871
Well, just what
any flight attendant wants.

133
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:38,315
Low-maintenance
passengers.

134
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:41,980
Uh-huh, that would
be very nice.

135
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,553
A'ite, ladies.

136
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:50,563
Hey, Troy, Leroy, I got this, all right?
Let me sign 'em for them.

137
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:52,565
Let me sign 'em for them.
Gimme that marker, son.

138
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:56,501
How you doing, sweetie?
You all right? There you go.

139
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:58,333
You take care, baby.
All right.

140
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:00,896
- Can I get your autograph?
- You can get a little more than that.

141
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,341
Yeah, no doubt. Let me do this on
the special for you right there.

142
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:08,074
- Mmm, yeah. Mm-hmm.
- It tickles.

143
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:10,082
Mmm!

144
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:12,141
- Take care, all right.
- All right.

145
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:14,676
- Will you sign this, please?
- Oh yeah, no doubt, little man.

146
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:16,712
Here we go.

147
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:18,587
- Mm, there you go.
- Thank you.

148
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,719
- Hey, yo, stay black.
- Hells, yeah.

149
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:23,319
All right.

150
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,888
All right, y'all, God bless you.
I gotta get out of here

151
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:28,457
and catch this flight, all right?
Y'all take care. Catch the next album.

152
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,628
- We can't wait!
- Yeah, all right, no doubt.

153
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:34,700
All right, look, we gotta make sure
we got some more of this, all right?

154
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,669
- Look at the Howard Hughes of rap.
- What?

155
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:40,679
What was that?

156
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:42,647
He-- he said,
man, can you believe this crap?

157
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:45,310
- Man, this is crap right here.
- Hey, yo, come on, y'all.

158
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:46,750
Y'all messing with t-shirts and hats.

159
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,151
Y'all are supposed to be
watching my back, son.

160
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:49,984
- Come on.
- You're right, brother, I got you.

161
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:52,924
Ladies and gentlemen,
South Pacific Air flight 121

162
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,688
- has been delayed half an hour.
- Oh, come on!

163
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:56,422
We apologize
for this inconvenience

164
00:10:56,462 --> 00:10:58,362
and we'll begin boarding
as soon as possible.

165
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:00,366
Oh, boy.
It's gonna be a fun flight.

166
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,834
Aloha all Island
Express passengers...

167
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:06,000
Five whole hours.

168
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,872
Do you know who's working today?
I didn't get a crew list.

169
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:11,274
You know,
I have no idea.

170
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,910
Oh my God.
Here she comes. Here she comes!

171
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:18,375
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

172
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:20,045
Oh!

173
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:24,387
Oh, Claire, don't go.

174
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,392
Last thing the world
needs is another lawyer.

175
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:28,121
I mean, really,
how could you leave all this?

176
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:30,857
- It's gonna be hard.
- Will you take me with you?

177
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:33,331
Please.

178
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,891
Could we ask for Bruno
from Simply Corporate?

179
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:38,768
Elena, by we,
I mean you.

180
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:42,138
No, not all drivers are the same.
That's the point.

181
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:44,439
The last thing I need is some guy
going on and on

182
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:48,038
about the weather
the whole way home. Get Bruno.

183
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:52,711
Mary Kate, hush.

184
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:56,085
Sorry, she gets
nervous flying.

185
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:58,647
Oh, that's okay.

186
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:00,283
I understand,
you know.

187
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:02,556
Do you think she'll
want some Xanax?

188
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:05,826
Oh no, she's okay.

189
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:11,770
How you feeling?

190
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:13,965
Yeah, fine.

191
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:15,940
You ready for this?

192
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:18,205
Yeah.

193
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,976
Is that our plane?

194
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:25,415
No, every cop in Honolulu
thinks it is.

195
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:29,617
Hey, come on, relax.

196
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:49,241
FBI's escorting
some guy to LA.

197
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:51,072
They just took over
all first class.

198
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,941
Are they allowed
to do that?

199
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:55,038
Well, apparently
FAA Section 108 states,

200
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:57,675
"If deemed necessary,
they can do whatever they want."

201
00:12:57,717 --> 00:13:00,652
Well, who's gonna tell the first class
passengers they're flying coach?

202
00:13:00,686 --> 00:13:03,052
That would be you, kid.

203
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:21,296
South Pacific Air 121.

204
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,273
Oh, my.

205
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:30,146
I was hoping you'd
be the sky candy on this flight.

206
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:32,879
You're looking especially
delicious this evening.

207
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,944
I love it when you
demean me, Rick.

208
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:37,581
My pleasure.
I gotta go fly a big plane.

209
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:39,887
- Hi, doll.
- Hi there, Rick.

210
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:42,156
Isn't he smooth?

211
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:47,930
Yes, sir. I'm soaking
the leis with it.

212
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:52,328
The pheromone will make
these guys go fucking crazy.

213
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,199
Duke.

214
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:05,808
Leave it, Duke.

215
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:13,588
- Ladies.
- Welcome aboard.

216
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,617
Agent Flynn.

217
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:24,061
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the final boarding call

218
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,503
- for South Pacific Air, flight 121...
- Aloha.

219
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:28,131
- Thank you.
- with nonstop service to Los Angeles.

220
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:30,540
- Aloha.
- No no no, the hair.

221
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:33,238
Aloha.

222
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:39,842
Unfortunately, first class
is overbooked.

223
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,683
But there's plenty of room for you
to stretch out in coach,

224
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:43,450
which is less than half full.
For the inconvenience,

225
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:45,855
we are offering you
a free travel coupon

226
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,883
good on any South Pacific
Air flight.

227
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:50,725
A free travel coupon won't help me get
to my meeting on time, now will it?

228
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:53,254
Sir, I'm pretty sure
that coach gets to Los Angeles

229
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,267
about the same time
as first.

230
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:58,702
Funny. Does my premium awards
membership come with sarcasm,

231
00:14:58,738 --> 00:15:01,673
or should I speak
to your supervisor, Claire?

232
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:06,568
This better be a matter
of national security.

233
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:08,773
Did I just hear
there's no first class?

234
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:10,907
I'm afraid only coach
is available.

235
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,612
Coach?
Is it safe there?

236
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:18,088
Yes, it is safe there.

237
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,635
Never flown
first class before.

238
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,035
See, things are
looking up already.

239
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:39,611
So how long you and Mr. Personality
been working together?

240
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:42,614
Um... five years,

241
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:45,617
one blown marriage each.

242
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:47,949
He's the toughest
son of a bitch I ever met.

243
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:50,478
Wow.

244
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,354
Yep, that's us.

245
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:54,382
The glamour
and the glory.

246
00:15:56,462 --> 00:16:00,421
Flynn, the captain's patching us
through to Harris for the flight.

247
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:10,473
Harris,
Special Agent Harris.

248
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,841
Harris, so how's
the new promotion?

249
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:15,438
- I'm loving it.
- That was a little quick.

250
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:18,279
- Wanna try again?
- No no, I'm serious, man.

251
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:21,150
You know, no more-- no more
junk food hangovers

252
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:23,655
after all-night stakeouts,
you know?

253
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:27,056
I'm actually spending nights
in bed with my wife.

254
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:29,391
She's hot.
You know, and my kids,

255
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:31,396
you know, forget about 'em.
They're kids.

256
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,024
I'm just spending every
waking minute with them.

257
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,658
You know, they're fun.

258
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:38,499
Please, this is me
you're talking to.

259
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:41,335
You know you miss it.
You miss the action.

260
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:44,639
You're bored to tears. So what are you
actually doing with your time?

261
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:47,612
- Surfing the net.
- Porn, no doubt.

262
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:51,105
No, hey, eBay,
my cynical-minded friend.

263
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,244
I'm right in the middle of a bidding war
with this punk-ass kid from Iowa

264
00:16:54,286 --> 00:16:56,720
for this black velvet...

265
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,553
Pamela Anderson poster.

266
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:00,718
Not technically porn.

267
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,285
So how's
Eddie Kim doing?

268
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,695
You ain't gotta worry about him.
He ain't going anywhere.

269
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:08,757
No, I got three teams on him,
so he's not gonna move.

270
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:12,669
All right, I'll see you
on the other side.

271
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:30,347
Are you sure
about this?

272
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:32,584
Accidents happen.

273
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,526
You think I didn't exhaust
every other option?

274
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:37,392
He saw me!

275
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,455
You're gonna be right down
this aisle to the left.

276
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,295
- Thank you.
- Oh, look at the little baby.

277
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,028
- He's beautiful.
- Thank you.

278
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:47,596
Oh, beautiful.

279
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,835
- Cheese.
- First, they stick me in coach

280
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,311
and then they put a freaking dog
next to me. What the hell is next?

281
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:55,006
Oh, you're adorable.

282
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,577
Okay.

283
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:03,448
Oh, great.
Just great.

284
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:06,890
Is there
a problem, mister?

285
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:09,554
Oh, gee,
what do you think?

286
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:14,223
Will you at least
get that vermin to shut up?

287
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,234
Don't worry, Mary Kate.

288
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:18,293
His hair plugs
can't hurt you.

289
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:25,705
Fucking dog, fucking coach,
fucking Americans!

290
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:29,374
Hi. Oh, I'm really sorry about first
class. Let me see if I can help--

291
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:32,145
Oh, oh, sweet-- Could you let her know
not to touch me, son?

292
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:34,152
Oh, please,
don't touch the man.

293
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:36,848
Man don't like to be touched.
We'll find our own seats.

294
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:39,756
Oh, sorry.
Here's some coupons.

295
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,317
- You all right, man?
- Yeah, I'm all right, man.

296
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,532
All right.

297
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:59,771
Coach ain't looking
so bad after all.

298
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,042
Bad boy.

299
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:11,215
Hey, yo, check it.
Check it out, check it out.

300
00:19:11,257 --> 00:19:13,691
You like that.

301
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:17,218
Baby got back, front
and side-to-side.

302
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,231
Hey, y'all two get together,
y'all might have,

303
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:21,324
like, two 20lb
babies or something.

304
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:27,500
Dad, why can't you
come with us?

305
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,508
Come on,
you're gonna be fine.

306
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,203
Bet you're even
gonna have fun.

307
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:33,677
- He's just being a baby.
- Curtis.

308
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:35,805
I'm counting on you to be a man.
Now what does a man do?

309
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:38,339
- He looks out for his family.
- That's right.

310
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:42,150
- Sir.
- Oh, sorry.

311
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:44,986
My wife is meeting them in LA.
It's their first time flying solo.

312
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:48,482
That's okay.
Hey.

313
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,688
- Can I tell you a secret?
- What?

314
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:52,697
- Guess who's on the plane?
- Who?

315
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:54,426
Three G's.

316
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,993
- For real?
- I bet you could meet him.

317
00:19:58,037 --> 00:20:00,062
Come on, Tommy,
let's go.

318
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:15,114
Ladies and gentlemen,

319
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:17,679
we would like to welcome
you to South Pacific Airlines

320
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:19,350
flight 121

321
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:22,189
nonstop service
from Honolulu

322
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:25,288
to Los Angeles. At this time, I would
like your full attention

323
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:27,458
as the flight attendants
demonstrate

324
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:29,490
the safety features
of this aircraft.

325
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:31,503
When the seat belt sign
illuminates,

326
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:33,732
you must fasten
your seat belt.

327
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:36,866
There are several emergency
exits on the aircraft,

328
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,934
located in
the forward section,

329
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:41,173
aft section
and over each wing.

330
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:43,613
In the event
of decompression...

331
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,617
an oxygen mask will
automatically drop

332
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,209
from a compartment
above your seat.

333
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:49,118
To start the flow
of oxygen,

334
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:51,714
pull the mask towards you,
place it firmly

335
00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:53,486
over your nose
and mouth,

336
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,551
secure the elastic band behind your
head and breathe normally.

337
00:20:56,595 --> 00:21:00,292
A lifejacket is located in a pouch
under your seat.

338
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:03,130
This is how you put it on.
Slip it over your head,

339
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:05,136
pass the straps
around your waist

340
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,468
and adjust loosely
at the front.

341
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:11,272
Tampering with, disabling or destroying
the smoke detectors located

342
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,768
in the lavatories
is prohibited by law.

343
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:17,281
We wish you
an enjoyable flight.

344
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,458
Radar indicates a bit
of weather up ahead.

345
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:31,463
We might catch
a few bumps in the road,

346
00:21:31,497 --> 00:21:34,364
but we'll be above most of it.
If you need anything at all,

347
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,426
you just holler at one
of those gorgeous flight attendants

348
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:39,767
and they'll take good care of y'all.
Thank you.

349
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:42,865
Good evening.

350
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:50,405
Thank you.

351
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:55,217
I'm Tiffany.

352
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:57,449
Hi, Tiffany.
I'm Sean.

353
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:03,625
So, um, mind if I, um...

354
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:06,460
ask what you did?

355
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:08,090
Oh, me?
Nothing.

356
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:12,430
It's what I'm
supposed to do.

357
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:15,974
Ever heard of Eddie Kim?

358
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,169
Oh, who hasn't?

359
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,735
Oh, I was watching one
of those crime shows once,

360
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:23,441
you know, with the hokey
reenactments,

361
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:26,542
where he tortured this guy who was
a witness against him

362
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:28,917
by gouging out his eyes

363
00:22:28,954 --> 00:22:32,082
and then feeding him
to some pigs.

364
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:34,524
Pretty gruesome stuff.

365
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,360
Yeah, he doesn't
mess around, that guy.

366
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:40,058
So, um, you know,

367
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,999
what are you--
what do you have to...

368
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:44,594
I'm a witness
for the prosecution.

369
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:47,935
- Wow.
- Yeah.

370
00:22:47,973 --> 00:22:50,874
That is so...

371
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:52,900
hot.

372
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,660
I'm gonna miss these
night flights.

373
00:23:17,703 --> 00:23:21,366
I enjoy the passengers so much better
when they're unconscious.

374
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,073
And you,
I'm gonna miss you.

375
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:28,937
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

376
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:30,846
- Can I get a gin and tonic?
- I'll be right back with that.

377
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:32,111
Thanks.

378
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:38,212
Ooh, wow.

379
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,059
In Hawaii for vacation?

380
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:45,894
Not really. I was there for
the kickboxing tournament.

381
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:48,627
Oh my God.
You're a kickboxer?

382
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,259
Me too.

383
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:53,169
Well, I take a kickboxing
class with Lonnie, Malibu Fitness.

384
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:54,399
Uh-huh.

385
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,737
- Awesome cardio.
- Good for you.

386
00:23:55,774 --> 00:23:57,765
My girlfriend and I
go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

387
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,334
Yeah, girlfriend.
Right.

388
00:23:59,378 --> 00:24:02,506
Wait, wait.
Watch this.

389
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:06,274
Come on, take it easy, buddy.
You okay?

390
00:24:06,318 --> 00:24:07,683
Son of a...

391
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,482
- Yeah, yeah.
- You all right, dude?

392
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:11,785
Hey, will you
look around?

393
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:13,951
Look around the plane.

394
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:16,620
How come there aren't
more people on this flight?

395
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:18,789
I can't figure it out.

396
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:22,267
Honey, 'cause it's
the red eye. Hmm?

397
00:24:25,771 --> 00:24:27,898
Okay, okay.

398
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,307
- I'm sorry, sweetie.
- No, I accept-- I accept that.

399
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:34,210
If you hated flying this much,
why did you let me pick Hawaii

400
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:36,339
for our honeymoon?

401
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,344
'Cause that's where
you wanted to go.

402
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:52,753
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

403
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:59,026
- Hmm, Bali, huh?
- What?

404
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:01,232
You said earlier you
wanted to go to Bali.

405
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:04,470
It's a very beautiful place.
I've been there.

406
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,911
You surf?
You don't look like a surfer.

407
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:10,278
- No disrespect.
- Hey, none taken.

408
00:25:10,315 --> 00:25:13,113
And I did try it.
I figure, why spend all my time

409
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:15,814
in the ocean when I could lay on
the beach and admire all the beauties,

410
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:17,822
- you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

411
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:19,949
Couldn't stay on
your board, could you?

412
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:23,826
No. Fell off every time.
Got me.

413
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:49,952
- Can I help you?
- No, I'm just stretching my legs.

414
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:52,081
Big plane, plenty of
places to do it.

415
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:54,786
Plenty of other places
to do it, you mean.

416
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:59,026
I do something
wrong here?

417
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:01,726
Technically, no.

418
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:04,292
But maybe next time, you people
could give us a little heads up

419
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:06,361
before you commandeer
the plane.

420
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:08,737
You people?

421
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:11,242
Oh, no no no no.
I--

422
00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:14,074
Hey, hey, don't stress it.
Just joking.

423
00:26:15,147 --> 00:26:18,116
So can I-- can I get you
something or...

424
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,244
No, I'm cool.
Just pretend I'm not here.

425
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:22,583
Okay.

426
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:29,318
Psst.
Psst.

427
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:30,988
Psst.

428
00:26:45,177 --> 00:26:47,304
- Hi.
- What's up?

429
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:49,610
This is Mary Kate.

430
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:51,946
- Yes, that's nice.
- And I'm Mercedes.

431
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:55,147
- You know, like the car, vroom vroom.
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

432
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:57,155
- Ooh, yeah.
- She likes you.

433
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:59,453
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Say hi.

434
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:01,982
- You are?
- Oh, come on now.

435
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:05,326
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm...

436
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:08,265
- Trying to steal my dog?
- Oh, believe me, I don't want the dog.

437
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,824
I'm kidding.
I know who you are.

438
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:11,802
- Yeah, I know you know who I am.
- Three G's.

439
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:13,702
All right, all right,
"Booty Go Thump."

440
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:15,400
Yeah, my booty went thump.

441
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,998
Yeah, I know
that's right.

442
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:18,805
That's tight.
That's tight.

443
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:21,779
Yeah, your dog, the dog.
No, that's good. It's cool.

444
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:23,246
- Yeah, I-- I love--
- Little kiss.

445
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:25,011
Yeah, I love dogs.

446
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:28,137
- Hi.
- Aloha.

447
00:28:34,653 --> 00:28:36,518
Here.

448
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:39,149
- Come on, come out.
- Hurry.

449
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:47,129
You see, at the end
of the day,

450
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:50,134
the music business
is still a business.

451
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:58,934
You okay?

452
00:28:58,977 --> 00:29:01,411
I'm-I'm-I'm good.
As I was saying,

453
00:29:01,446 --> 00:29:04,279
see, I'm all about
taking the music

454
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:06,147
and the business
to the next level.

455
00:29:06,184 --> 00:29:08,584
You know what I'm saying?
That's when evolution

456
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,588
becomes revolution.

457
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:17,991
Here, babe.

458
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,827
Screw it.

459
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:04,575
Harder.

460
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:46,910
Mile High Club.

461
00:30:48,787 --> 00:30:51,119
Those were the days.

462
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:56,824
Oh. This guy
is really good.

463
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:03,425
Well, maybe not that good.

464
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:31,359
We just lost avionics.

465
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,794
Notify LAX.

466
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,866
LAX, Hula 1-2-1,

467
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:43,465
mayday, mayday, mayday.

468
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:47,501
We are 1,500 nautical miles
southwest of Los Angeles.

469
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:50,447
Repeat, mayday,
we have lost avionics.

470
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:53,280
Hula 1-2-1, heavy,
Los Angeles tower.

471
00:31:53,318 --> 00:31:55,752
We acknowledge your emergency.
You have priority.

472
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:58,119
All right, give me the manual.
Take control.

473
00:31:58,156 --> 00:32:00,249
I have control.

474
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,422
I'll be back.

475
00:32:52,477 --> 00:32:55,844
How's my big boy?

476
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:09,093
Aw, fuck!

477
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:14,558
Fucking bitch!
Get off my dick!

478
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,999
Aw, fuck!

479
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:21,834
Fuck.

480
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,508
'Cause, you know, keeping your sexy
right is part of the business too.

481
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:03,514
And if you
don't mind me saying,

482
00:34:03,548 --> 00:34:06,210
it looks like you keep
your sexy very, very right.

483
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:08,481
Well, thank you.

484
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,751
- Have you ever acted before?
- No.

485
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,782
'Cause you know, I-- I would love to put
you in one of my pool-party videos.

486
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:16,384
- Oh, yeah?
- Throw a little thong on you--

487
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,794
- Excuse me, she just wants a treat.
- All right.

488
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,534
I can never find
anything in here.

489
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:26,537
Her doctor says
she's bipolar.

490
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,901
I almost beat the last level.

491
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:32,807
Hey, man, you playing
that damn video game?

492
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:34,709
Or was that video
game playing you, son?

493
00:34:35,814 --> 00:34:38,248
- Damn!
- Found them.

494
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:19,221
Sir, I can assure you,
there's no strange smell.

495
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:21,054
Maybe you're
allergic to the leis.

496
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:23,026
Let me take
that for you.

497
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:25,029
Oh, yeah.

498
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:28,255
Thank you, miss.

499
00:35:28,299 --> 00:35:30,164
Any idea how long this
turbulence will last?

500
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:32,499
No, I'm okay.

501
00:35:32,537 --> 00:35:34,767
Well, I'm gonna go
and ask the pilot.

502
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:44,008
Aw, shit, Rick,
we got smoke.

503
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:46,448
Something probably
arced in the avionics.

504
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,119
How much longer do you
think before we climb-- what happened?

505
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:57,651
We lost the board.

506
00:35:57,695 --> 00:35:59,492
I gotta reset
the breakers.

507
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:03,457
- Keep her steady, Rick.
- All right.

508
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:31,388
Okay, Cap,
they're coming back!

509
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:40,530
That's it, old man,
we're back in busin--

510
00:36:45,677 --> 00:36:47,372
Captain!

511
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:50,578
- Rick!
- What is it?

512
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:53,345
Something's happened
to the captain!

513
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:55,716
All right. Coming.

514
00:36:57,622 --> 00:36:59,522
Oh, Christ.

515
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:03,556
- Did you-- did you see what happened?
- No.

516
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:08,790
Captain?

517
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:12,866
I think he's had
a heart attack.

518
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:22,941
Agent Flynn,
Agent Sanders,

519
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,846
can I see you
for a moment, please?

520
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,931
I flew with that man
for 10 years.

521
00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:47,795
Let's go back.

522
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,273
We're halfway. It'd take longer
to get back to Honolulu

523
00:37:50,308 --> 00:37:51,832
than keep going to LA.

524
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:53,844
Make sure everybody's
strapped in.

525
00:38:01,386 --> 00:38:04,082
LAX tower,
this is Hula 1-2-1,

526
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:05,646
mayday, mayday, mayday,

527
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,124
pilot in command has suffered
a fatal heart attack.

528
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,821
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Captain requests

529
00:38:10,862 --> 00:38:12,557
- that you remain in your seats...
- Shhh.

530
00:38:12,597 --> 00:38:14,292
with your
seat belts fastened.

531
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:16,527
Thank you.

532
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:18,592
Shhh, shhh.

533
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,289
Hi, how are you doing?

534
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:46,593
Think of it like
a roller coaster ride.

535
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,155
Do you like
roller coaster rides?

536
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,190
No, not really.

537
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:53,567
No, me neither.
They always make me sick.

538
00:38:53,604 --> 00:38:56,801
Okay. Here's what
we're gonna do:

539
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:58,433
You are gonna
close your eyes

540
00:38:58,476 --> 00:39:00,808
and count
very slowly to 10.

541
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:04,281
And when you open your eyes, you make
the funniest face you can at each other.

542
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:07,011
And whoever
laughs first loses.

543
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:09,986
Okay?
Best out of five wins.

544
00:39:10,021 --> 00:39:13,013
And I will be back to
check on the winner.

545
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:19,386
One, two, three...

546
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,399
- Sir, seat belt please.
- Yeah. Great.

547
00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:24,298
Thank you.

548
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,684
Oh my God!

549
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,119
What the--

550
00:39:58,403 --> 00:40:00,371
What the hell?!

551
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:07,142
Ow! Ow!

552
00:40:07,178 --> 00:40:09,703
- Whoa!
- Oh!

553
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:13,883
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck?!

554
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:15,579
I'll go.

555
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:21,418
Oh, shit.

556
00:40:38,843 --> 00:40:42,279
- Get down!
- What the hell? It's snakes!

557
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:55,419
Rick, what's up with
the oxygen masks deploying?

558
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,394
Oh, sorry about that.

559
00:40:57,428 --> 00:41:00,056
You're not gonna believe what came out
of the goddamn instrument panel.

560
00:41:00,098 --> 00:41:01,895
What?

561
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:03,594
Look at this.

562
00:41:03,634 --> 00:41:05,693
Goddamn snake, honey!

563
00:41:24,021 --> 00:41:25,818
John! Stay up here!

564
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,890
Flynn!

565
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:36,529
I've got...

566
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:38,558
ophidiophobia--
fear of snakes.

567
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,202
Stay!
Mary Kate, sit!

568
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:48,041
Bad girl.
Bad, bad girl.

569
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:55,117
Come to the front, there aren't any
snakes here! It's safe.

570
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,368
Everybody, move forward!

571
00:42:11,402 --> 00:42:13,962
Cautiously!

572
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:21,903
Come here.

573
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:51,741
Get out of my way!
Get out of the way!

574
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:55,336
Son of a bitch!

575
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:07,319
- Out of the way, grandma!
- Oh!

576
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:17,329
What the--?
Fuck!

577
00:43:23,174 --> 00:43:26,769
Oh my God, help!

578
00:43:31,682 --> 00:43:34,048
Help!

579
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,335
Go, go!

580
00:43:58,376 --> 00:43:59,934
Oh, fuck me!

581
00:43:59,977 --> 00:44:01,945
Okay, okay.

582
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:03,879
Oh, fuck, fuck.

583
00:44:03,914 --> 00:44:06,474
Oh, shit, shit!

584
00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:12,755
Yeah-ha-ha-ha!

585
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,849
Who's your daddy
now, bitch?!

586
00:44:16,627 --> 00:44:19,095
Oh fuck! Oh!

587
00:44:20,398 --> 00:44:23,890
Man, you guys are supposed
to be watching my back!

588
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:25,925
Front, come on.
We gotta get to the front!

589
00:44:27,238 --> 00:44:28,865
Grab a tray table!

590
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:36,042
Oh! Smash that!

591
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,674
Little bitch!
Come on!

592
00:44:40,084 --> 00:44:41,381
Move!

593
00:44:41,419 --> 00:44:44,582
Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!

594
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,724
Ow! Get this fucking
snake off my ass!

595
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:51,489
Oh, stop. You got
a snake on your ass! Yo, hold still!

596
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:53,258
- Get it off!
- Get him out! Get him out!

597
00:44:53,297 --> 00:44:55,629
- Get him out of here!
- Come on, man!

598
00:44:58,469 --> 00:45:00,096
Keep moving!
Keep moving!

599
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,902
Everybody listen!
We have to put a barrier

600
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:07,911
between us
and the snakes!

601
00:45:07,945 --> 00:45:10,436
Grab everything from the overheads,
under the seats,

602
00:45:10,481 --> 00:45:12,506
and let's build a wall.
Let's go!

603
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:30,965
- Ken! Do this.
- Okay.

604
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:15,708
Help me!

605
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:19,982
Please help me!

606
00:46:27,191 --> 00:46:30,058
Hi-ya! I'm gonna
put you on my back.

607
00:46:30,094 --> 00:46:31,789
And we're gonna move
towards the front, okay?

608
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:34,161
- No, I can't. No, I can't.
- Here we go! Come on.

609
00:46:34,198 --> 00:46:36,189
Let's go. Yes, you can.
You can do it, come on, up!

610
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:38,929
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Mary Kate!

611
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,437
Here we go.

612
00:46:51,015 --> 00:46:53,711
I need everyone to close
any compartment that's open!

613
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:55,480
Just close them!

614
00:46:57,822 --> 00:47:00,950
- I can't reach.
- I got it.

615
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:03,050
Let me get it.

616
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:05,584
Hey, whoa whoa whoa.
It's only me. What's up?

617
00:47:05,629 --> 00:47:07,995
- I can't find those two little boys.
- Little boys?

618
00:47:08,032 --> 00:47:11,001
Tommy and Curtis,
they were by themselves.

619
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:22,209
- Hey!
- Mister, my brother-- he got bit.

620
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:26,510
I was supposed
to take care of him.

621
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,381
You are taking care
of him, sweetheart.

622
00:47:28,419 --> 00:47:30,148
You're taking care
of him right now.

623
00:47:30,187 --> 00:47:33,953
- Is-is he gonna die?
- No, honey.

624
00:47:33,991 --> 00:47:35,959
But you have to be brave
for him now, okay?

625
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:37,620
Okay, sweetheart.

626
00:48:12,196 --> 00:48:14,892
Are you okay?

627
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:16,524
My baby!
Where is my baby!

628
00:48:25,276 --> 00:48:27,767
Oh, Lord.

629
00:48:41,158 --> 00:48:43,285
- Oh, my baby!
- Here you go.

630
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:46,057
- Go go go go! Hurry!
- Thank you!

631
00:48:46,096 --> 00:48:47,791
Come on! Come on!

632
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:50,197
Come through!
Hurry, hurry!

633
00:48:51,435 --> 00:48:54,063
Help! I need help!

634
00:48:56,407 --> 00:48:58,375
Oh my God, Grace.

635
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:00,809
Okay, okay.

636
00:49:03,814 --> 00:49:06,009
Okay.

637
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,018
- Let me, let me. I got her.
- Oh my God.

638
00:49:08,052 --> 00:49:10,418
I have to go
and tell Rick.

639
00:49:10,454 --> 00:49:14,117
Grab the first-aid kit!
Grace, hey hey hey...

640
00:49:14,158 --> 00:49:17,650
Here's some water.
Come on, man, you got to drink water.

641
00:49:17,695 --> 00:49:20,220
Breathe, breathe.

642
00:49:20,264 --> 00:49:22,755
We missed the bastards

643
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,893
because they
were cold-blooded.

644
00:49:24,935 --> 00:49:26,698
Come on, come on.

645
00:49:26,737 --> 00:49:29,331
John, John, listen
to me, you're okay.

646
00:49:29,373 --> 00:49:32,342
Just take a deep breath,
John, you're having a panic attack.

647
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:39,376
Mmm...

648
00:49:41,552 --> 00:49:43,315
Oh, shit.

649
00:49:47,324 --> 00:49:49,224
You've gotta
be kidding me!

650
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,496
Good luck.

651
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:59,362
John?

652
00:50:11,548 --> 00:50:13,812
Son of a--

653
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:17,287
Hey hey hey, we have
to figure something out.

654
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:19,755
All right. Well,
I know what I gotta do.

655
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,519
We're in a 200-foot
aluminum tube

656
00:50:21,558 --> 00:50:23,526
and we're 30,000
feet in the air.

657
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,585
And any one of those slimy
little pieces of shit

658
00:50:25,629 --> 00:50:27,961
can trip a circuit
or a relay or a hydraulic

659
00:50:27,998 --> 00:50:30,694
and this bird goes down
faster than a Thai hooker.

660
00:50:30,734 --> 00:50:34,966
So my job is to keep LAX informed
on how totally screwed we are,

661
00:50:35,005 --> 00:50:36,768
and then find some way
to keep this mother

662
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:40,208
in the sky another two hours.
Figure that out.

663
00:50:41,578 --> 00:50:45,139
- Hey hey, where you going?
- Uh, I have to go down.

664
00:50:45,182 --> 00:50:47,343
I have to help
the passengers.

665
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:54,223
Now there's supposed
to be a doctor aboard. A Dr...

666
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:56,726
Robert Foster.
Robert Foster!

667
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,126
Wait, here he is.
Here he is. Dr. Robert Foster,

668
00:50:59,163 --> 00:51:02,326
row 11, seat H.

669
00:51:19,249 --> 00:51:21,012
Yeah, Harris.

670
00:51:21,051 --> 00:51:23,713
Um, Sanders is dead.

671
00:51:26,123 --> 00:51:29,149
You know all those goddamn security
scenarios we ran?

672
00:51:29,193 --> 00:51:31,821
Well, I'm smack in the middle of one
we didn't think of.

673
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:33,386
What the hell
you talking about?

674
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,921
Eddie Kim somehow
managed to fill the plane

675
00:51:35,966 --> 00:51:37,524
with poisonous snakes.

676
00:51:37,568 --> 00:51:40,833
Wait, hold on.
What kind of insane plan is that?

677
00:51:40,871 --> 00:51:42,532
He can't
possibly guarantee

678
00:51:42,573 --> 00:51:44,268
that the snakes
are gonna get to Sean.

679
00:51:44,308 --> 00:51:46,208
Yeah well, he doesn't
have to guarantee it

680
00:51:46,243 --> 00:51:48,871
if he brings
the whole plane down.

681
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,044
Listen up.
Everybody listen up.

682
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:58,145
I want a crisis team
at LAX, ASAP.

683
00:51:58,188 --> 00:52:00,679
And I need the cargo manifest
for every scrap of freight

684
00:52:00,724 --> 00:52:02,783
on South Pacific Air 121.

685
00:52:04,094 --> 00:52:05,959
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

686
00:52:05,996 --> 00:52:09,124
I need the best poisonous snake
expert in this time zone.

687
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:12,761
And I need him in my ear or at my side
in 20 minutes or less.

688
00:52:12,803 --> 00:52:16,239
Well come on, people, let's go!
Somebody make that happen for me!

689
00:52:16,273 --> 00:52:19,037
Hey, tell surveillance,
don't let Eddie Kim out of their sight.

690
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:24,445
All right, we have to--
we have to suck out the poison.

691
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:26,915
- Man, I ain't sucking nothing.
- Okay, I'll do it.

692
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,043
What?! Oh, there'll
be no sucking.

693
00:52:29,086 --> 00:52:30,917
Man, Troy, get this
man away from my ass!

694
00:52:30,954 --> 00:52:32,888
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, we sure. Thanks, pal.

695
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:35,187
Okay, sweetheart,
it's gonna be okay.

696
00:52:35,225 --> 00:52:37,022
Oh my God!

697
00:52:41,198 --> 00:52:43,189
Hold my baby, please.

698
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:45,565
Forget about that.

699
00:52:45,602 --> 00:52:47,695
Do you have any
olive oil on the plane?

700
00:52:47,738 --> 00:52:49,228
- Olive oil? Olive oil.
- Yeah.

701
00:52:49,273 --> 00:52:50,740
- I'm on it.
- Yeah, in a cup!

702
00:52:50,774 --> 00:52:52,765
Okay.

703
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,005
When I was a kid,
whenever we went hiking,

704
00:52:55,045 --> 00:52:58,640
we always carried olive oil and a razor
blade in case of a snake bite.

705
00:52:58,682 --> 00:53:00,741
I need something to cut.

706
00:53:00,784 --> 00:53:02,581
Here you go.

707
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,181
Okay, this--
this will work, yeah.

708
00:53:09,726 --> 00:53:12,854
Okay, oil. So you
swish it in your mouth

709
00:53:12,896 --> 00:53:14,591
to seal it
from the poison.

710
00:53:19,136 --> 00:53:20,763
- Look at Claire, Tommy.
- Look at me, sweetie--

711
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:22,499
It's gonna hurt
a little bit, okay?

712
00:53:24,107 --> 00:53:27,167
- Okay, now.
- It hurts.

713
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:29,236
You're so brave.

714
00:53:31,348 --> 00:53:33,282
Yeah, it's gonna
be all right, Tommy.

715
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,087
Ow! Ah!

716
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,790
That's what
I'm talking about.

717
00:53:47,164 --> 00:53:50,395
- Good, boy.
- Yeah, I think I got it all.

718
00:53:50,434 --> 00:53:53,130
It's gonna be okay, Tommy.
You're very, very brave.

719
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:56,503
Um, I-I got bit too.

720
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:10,815
- Flynn, what the hell--
- Just sit tight.

721
00:54:10,854 --> 00:54:12,583
I can't. I--

722
00:54:12,623 --> 00:54:14,284
Do you remember the first
thing I ever said to you?

723
00:54:14,324 --> 00:54:15,416
Yes.

724
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:17,086
So what was the first thing
I ever said to you?

725
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:18,617
I-I know,
but things have changed.

726
00:54:18,662 --> 00:54:21,187
What was the first thing
I said to you?!

727
00:54:21,231 --> 00:54:23,995
Things have changed!
You have a whole plane full of sna--

728
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:25,695
God! "Do as I say,
you live."

729
00:54:25,736 --> 00:54:27,670
Nothing's changed.

730
00:54:27,704 --> 00:54:29,899
Now I need you to stay
up here by the air phone.

731
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,170
When Agent Harris calls,
you come and get me.

732
00:54:32,209 --> 00:54:34,268
You got it?

733
00:54:35,345 --> 00:54:37,210
Got it.

734
00:54:42,286 --> 00:54:44,982
Hey hey hey! They're getting through
the luggage, here, seriously.

735
00:54:45,022 --> 00:54:46,353
I need some help!

736
00:54:49,426 --> 00:54:51,053
Fire extinguisher!

737
00:55:03,073 --> 00:55:05,541
- Ken!
- Agent Flynn, here.

738
00:55:07,644 --> 00:55:10,238
Weapons-- we have to have weapons.
Where's the silverware?

739
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,475
Well, we don't-- we don't
have any silverware.

740
00:55:12,516 --> 00:55:14,575
All we have is this.

741
00:55:14,618 --> 00:55:17,746
- Sporks?
- Yeah.

742
00:55:19,056 --> 00:55:21,081
Here.

743
00:55:22,192 --> 00:55:24,023
Use that.

744
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:28,525
His name is
Dr. Stephen Price.

745
00:55:28,565 --> 00:55:31,261
He's-- he's some kind of
hardcore snake specialist.

746
00:55:32,636 --> 00:55:34,763
And customs uses him
as their go-to guy

747
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:37,535
for any animal
smuggling cases.

748
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:40,771
- The go-to guy?
- Yeah. So he must be good.

749
00:55:52,923 --> 00:55:54,550
Dr. Price?

750
00:55:54,591 --> 00:55:56,582
- It is I.
- Hank Harris.

751
00:55:56,626 --> 00:55:59,527
I'm hoping this is important,
I've got baby Antiguan racer eggs

752
00:55:59,563 --> 00:56:01,963
in there ready to hatch--
the first time ever in captivity

753
00:56:01,999 --> 00:56:03,523
- Really?
- It's very exciting.

754
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:06,001
Wow. I got another exciting first
I'd like to tell you about.

755
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:09,101
I need another!
Help, somebody!

756
00:56:10,674 --> 00:56:12,699
Come on!
Help me out here!

757
00:56:12,743 --> 00:56:14,734
- Please, I can't-- I can't do this!
- Hold on, I'm coming!

758
00:56:14,778 --> 00:56:17,212
Come on! Somebody get me another
fire extinguisher!

759
00:56:19,816 --> 00:56:21,511
All right, we we got
less than 90 minutes.

760
00:56:21,551 --> 00:56:24,952
We've already lost over 50 people
and that's including an FBI agent.

761
00:56:24,988 --> 00:56:26,512
Okay.

762
00:56:26,556 --> 00:56:28,683
Look, we've already
contacted local ERs.

763
00:56:28,725 --> 00:56:30,659
Oh, local ERs.

764
00:56:30,694 --> 00:56:33,663
Uh, I don't think you
understand the magnitude

765
00:56:33,697 --> 00:56:36,131
of what you're
dealing with here.

766
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,031
LA County ERs can,
at best,

767
00:56:38,068 --> 00:56:40,901
handle the occasional
snake bite.

768
00:56:40,937 --> 00:56:45,203
Uh, not an entire
747 full of them.

769
00:56:45,242 --> 00:56:48,040
I'm going to contact
the National Poison Control Center

770
00:56:48,078 --> 00:56:51,775
to have them alert every ER
in the tri-county area

771
00:56:51,815 --> 00:56:55,683
and to order every available helicopter
crew to be ready.

772
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:58,347
We've got less than
two hours to mobilize an entire army.

773
00:57:00,724 --> 00:57:02,453
Flynn, Flynn!

774
00:57:02,492 --> 00:57:05,188
Hey, they got-- they got
a snake guy on the phone.

775
00:57:05,228 --> 00:57:07,662
Who the hell is that?

776
00:57:07,697 --> 00:57:09,688
His name is Dr. Price.

777
00:57:12,202 --> 00:57:15,171
Look, Doc, people are dying
up here. We need help fast.

778
00:57:15,205 --> 00:57:18,265
Okay, just break open any blisters
that form around the bites.

779
00:57:18,308 --> 00:57:20,333
- Keep them clean.
- We're doing that.

780
00:57:20,377 --> 00:57:23,437
- It doesn't seem to be doing much good.
- Snakes don't attack

781
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,880
unless they're
provoked, right?

782
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:28,077
Something up there
is making them go crazy.

783
00:57:28,118 --> 00:57:29,710
Yeah, no shit.

784
00:57:29,753 --> 00:57:32,244
They're attacking everybody
and everything up here.

785
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:34,519
They're especially fond
of those fucking leis.

786
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:37,459
Leis? Jesus,
I don't know, uh...

787
00:57:37,494 --> 00:57:39,325
it could possibly
be a pheromone.

788
00:57:39,362 --> 00:57:41,990
That's what female animals release
to trigger mating behavior.

789
00:57:42,032 --> 00:57:45,001
It could also provoke
serious hyperaggression.

790
00:57:45,035 --> 00:57:47,162
Like some kind of drug.

791
00:57:47,204 --> 00:57:48,933
Well, that's good news.

792
00:57:48,972 --> 00:57:51,372
Snakes on crack.

793
00:57:51,408 --> 00:57:53,342
How could you imbeciles
let somebody put snakes--

794
00:57:53,376 --> 00:57:55,401
- We need to turn this plane around
- I don't want to die.

795
00:57:55,445 --> 00:57:58,243
- We need to get them to a hospital
- We're almost to LA now.

796
00:57:58,281 --> 00:57:59,805
Know what they call that?
The point of no return.

797
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,374
So this is it?
That's what the plan is?

798
00:58:01,418 --> 00:58:03,978
We sit around here waiting
for the snakes to bite us?

799
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,818
Look, everyone
just calm down, please!

800
00:58:06,857 --> 00:58:08,415
We're doing
the best we can here.

801
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:10,790
Okay, look, there are hundreds
of species of snakes

802
00:58:10,827 --> 00:58:12,522
with hundreds
of cocktails of venom.

803
00:58:12,562 --> 00:58:14,154
Some will kill you
in two minutes,

804
00:58:14,197 --> 00:58:16,131
others in two hours
and some you can

805
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:18,532
actually cure with
a good night's rest.

806
00:58:18,568 --> 00:58:20,092
But here's the thing:

807
00:58:20,137 --> 00:58:22,571
If you administer
the wrong antivenom,

808
00:58:22,606 --> 00:58:24,301
that will kill you.

809
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:26,866
I am not
a zoologist, man.

810
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:29,845
I can identify maybe
two of the snakes I've seen up here.

811
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,575
A cobra
and a rattlesnake, okay?

812
00:58:31,615 --> 00:58:33,207
You're going to
have to be more--

813
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,013
much more
specific than that.

814
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:37,485
Oh, shit.

815
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:39,955
Um, look, um,

816
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,924
I'll round up all
the dead ones I can find

817
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,983
and-- and I'll call
you back, okay?

818
00:58:44,027 --> 00:58:45,688
Make it fast.
Time is tissue.

819
00:58:45,729 --> 00:58:47,890
Time is t--

820
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,994
I want to know
what's going on.

821
00:58:52,035 --> 00:58:53,900
- Get out of the way!
- No, no! No!

822
00:58:53,937 --> 00:58:55,598
You guys are not
supposed to go up there.

823
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:58,233
- Move, girl!
- You can't take the stairs!

824
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,114
You can't keep
us down there.

825
00:59:05,148 --> 00:59:07,048
Why exactly are there
snakes on this plane?

826
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:08,983
- I don't have time to explain.
- Well, you better make time.

827
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:11,317
You put us at risk
and you're gonna tell us why.

828
00:59:11,354 --> 00:59:14,653
What I'm gonna tell you
is to go back downstairs now.

829
00:59:14,691 --> 00:59:16,181
Man, who the hell
you think you are?

830
00:59:16,226 --> 00:59:17,818
Whoa whoa whoa,
okay, look.

831
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:19,954
The snakes are
on the plane because...

832
00:59:19,996 --> 00:59:22,089
I'm supposed to testify
tomorrow against Eddie Kim.

833
00:59:22,132 --> 00:59:24,692
Oh, Jesus Christ,
we're all dead.

834
00:59:24,734 --> 00:59:26,702
Not me.

835
00:59:26,736 --> 00:59:28,897
It's my job to handle
life-and-death situations

836
00:59:28,939 --> 00:59:30,930
on a daily basis.
It's what I do,

837
00:59:30,974 --> 00:59:32,908
and I'm very good at it.

838
00:59:32,943 --> 00:59:35,002
Now you can stand there
and be the panicked, angry mob

839
00:59:35,045 --> 00:59:38,481
and blame him, me and the government
for getting you into this.

840
00:59:38,515 --> 00:59:40,506
But if you want
to survive tonight,

841
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,415
you need to save
your energy

842
00:59:42,452 --> 00:59:44,647
and start
working together.

843
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:46,246
Now what we need to do

844
00:59:46,289 --> 00:59:49,315
is go back in there and find
all the dead snakes we can

845
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,951
so the doctors
on the ground

846
00:59:50,994 --> 00:59:52,985
will know what kind
of antivenoms we need.

847
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:55,122
Whatever you find,
you bring it to me.

848
00:59:55,165 --> 00:59:57,963
And I don't need to tell
you to be careful.

849
01:00:01,938 --> 01:00:03,667
Whoa whoa whoa,
where you going?

850
01:00:03,707 --> 01:00:06,005
I'm going with--
I-I can't just sit here doing nothing.

851
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:08,977
Remember when you
said it's all about choices we make?

852
01:00:09,012 --> 01:00:10,980
Well, I'm making one.
Don't treat me like a prisoner!

853
01:00:11,014 --> 01:00:12,538
I need you
to stay up here.

854
01:00:12,582 --> 01:00:16,074
- Why?
- Because if you die,

855
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:18,986
then all this
was for nothing.

856
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:21,081
Sit your ass down.

857
01:00:21,124 --> 01:00:22,955
We got a snake, man.

858
01:00:50,387 --> 01:00:52,480
Okay, Doc, I got one
here that's, um...

859
01:00:52,522 --> 01:00:56,288
I guess, brownish on top and I'd say
green on the bottom.

860
01:00:56,326 --> 01:00:58,419
Wait a second, pure green?
Or is it blue?

861
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:00,793
Um, well, if I had to guess,
I'd say green.

862
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,798
No no no, teal.
It's a deep shade of teal.

863
01:01:02,832 --> 01:01:04,595
It's-- it's teal, Doc.

864
01:01:04,634 --> 01:01:06,363
Why don't we just
take a picture?

865
01:01:06,403 --> 01:01:09,600
Oh, sure, let's drop it off at Jiffy
Photo when we land, Einstein.

866
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:11,004
Ever heard of e-mail,
dick-wad?

867
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:12,702
All we need is a digital camera
and a computer.

868
01:01:12,742 --> 01:01:15,711
Or this.
It's got both.

869
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:18,976
Doc, I'm gonna e-mail you
some pictures, all right?

870
01:01:27,223 --> 01:01:29,714
Rick!

871
01:01:29,759 --> 01:01:32,091
Rick?

872
01:01:35,098 --> 01:01:36,725
Rick!

873
01:01:38,735 --> 01:01:40,862
Rick!

874
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:47,766
Oh, God.

875
01:02:01,324 --> 01:02:03,315
Are we landing?

876
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,023
- There are no lights down there.
- I don't think so.

877
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:09,088
Doc, photos are
coming to you now.

878
01:02:14,003 --> 01:02:16,096
Everybody,
buckle up now! Now!

879
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:18,334
Oh my God, no!

880
01:02:22,078 --> 01:02:26,105
- Come on, buckle up. I got you.
- Oh my God!

881
01:02:52,308 --> 01:02:53,935
Fucker!

882
01:02:56,813 --> 01:02:58,781
Hya!

883
01:03:01,785 --> 01:03:03,685
Okay, let's pull
this thing up.

884
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,553
Hula 1-2-1 heavy, you're descending
through 23,000 feet.

885
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:08,955
There's no time to strap in,
just pull up, pull hard!

886
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:13,361
Somebody help me!
Somebody help, they're coming through.

887
01:03:17,834 --> 01:03:21,133
Tiffany! Tiffany!

888
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:23,002
Look out!

889
01:03:24,941 --> 01:03:26,806
- You okay?
- Yeah.

890
01:03:29,345 --> 01:03:32,041
We gotta get the people upstairs.
It's safer there.

891
01:03:37,086 --> 01:03:40,180
Somebody help me.

892
01:03:40,223 --> 01:03:42,316
Kill them!

893
01:03:44,427 --> 01:03:45,826
Hula 1-2-1, heavy

894
01:03:45,862 --> 01:03:49,229
you're now below 19,000 feet.
Do you copy?

895
01:03:49,265 --> 01:03:51,961
It's not working.

896
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:54,731
- I wanna get out.
- Let me get you up.

897
01:03:54,771 --> 01:03:57,069
Get upstairs, come on.

898
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:00,570
Go!

899
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,601
Go go go go!

900
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:10,215
Hula 1-2-1, heavy,
pull up. Pull up.

901
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:37,409
Get out!

902
01:04:43,953 --> 01:04:45,921
Hurry!

903
01:04:45,955 --> 01:04:49,948
- Out of the way!
- Move your ass, God damn it!

904
01:04:58,368 --> 01:05:00,268
Go, go!

905
01:05:04,407 --> 01:05:07,171
No.

906
01:05:11,114 --> 01:05:12,308
Come on, quicker!

907
01:05:12,348 --> 01:05:14,316
- Come on!
- Move it!

908
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:16,375
Move it!

909
01:05:16,419 --> 01:05:18,319
Hurry!

910
01:05:21,691 --> 01:05:24,922
Hang on to me.
I've got you!

911
01:05:31,701 --> 01:05:34,864
Get me off this plane!

912
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,607
Come on!

913
01:05:46,649 --> 01:05:48,776
Get back!

914
01:05:48,818 --> 01:05:50,547
Go, quick!
Move!

915
01:06:10,707 --> 01:06:12,265
Oh shit!

916
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:14,708
Mary Kate!

917
01:06:14,744 --> 01:06:16,371
You animal!

918
01:06:16,412 --> 01:06:19,870
- You animal! I hate you!
- Freakin' dog, lady.

919
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:21,679
- I hate you!
- Why did you do that?

920
01:06:21,718 --> 01:06:24,380
What? You all would have
done exactly the same thing.

921
01:06:29,225 --> 01:06:31,056
Somebody do something.

922
01:06:31,094 --> 01:06:33,255
Look out!
Oh my God!

923
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,654
Let's go. Hey hey,
in back of you!

924
01:06:59,689 --> 01:07:01,179
- Behind you.
- Come on!

925
01:07:04,327 --> 01:07:07,353
Come on, move move move!
Come on, come on.

926
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:15,367
We gotta block the stairs.
Grab bags, everyone.

927
01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:16,736
- Come on!
- Pass it down!

928
01:07:21,444 --> 01:07:24,242
Get me NTSB.

929
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,441
And call the Coast Guard.

930
01:07:26,482 --> 01:07:28,450
Hula 1-2-1, heavy,

931
01:07:28,484 --> 01:07:31,544
you are now below
1,000 feet. Pull up.

932
01:07:31,587 --> 01:07:34,112
Pull up!

933
01:07:45,234 --> 01:07:46,792
Oh, my God.

934
01:07:46,836 --> 01:07:50,135
Holy fuck!

935
01:07:52,442 --> 01:07:55,605
Oh, thank God.

936
01:07:55,645 --> 01:07:57,670
Wait a second.
What about the life raft?

937
01:07:57,714 --> 01:07:59,147
- Use this!
- Good idea.

938
01:07:59,182 --> 01:08:02,015
I got it!

939
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,645
Hello, can anybody
hear me?

940
01:08:06,689 --> 01:08:08,554
Hula 1-2-1, heavy,

941
01:08:08,591 --> 01:08:10,752
somebody wanna tell me
what's going on up there?

942
01:08:10,793 --> 01:08:13,353
We've lost our--

943
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:18,492
Rick.

944
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:29,842
- Hold, hold, push!
- Come on, hurry!

945
01:08:29,879 --> 01:08:31,471
Kill it.
Kill it!

946
01:08:31,514 --> 01:08:33,675
Here, grab an end!

947
01:08:33,716 --> 01:08:36,708
Oh, Rick.

948
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,495
Hold it, hold it down.
Push it down.

949
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:50,863
That's great, okay. Get it down.
There you go. There you go.

950
01:08:51,868 --> 01:08:53,529
Don't let anybody down.

951
01:08:54,804 --> 01:08:56,897
Oh, Rick, your arm.

952
01:08:59,142 --> 01:09:01,007
Okay.

953
01:09:01,043 --> 01:09:03,375
There you go.

954
01:09:03,412 --> 01:09:05,175
Oh, yeah,
you know, Claire,

955
01:09:05,214 --> 01:09:06,875
I think I'm gonna need
your shirt, too.

956
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,908
- Oh, Jeez. Very funny.
- Gotta try, right?

957
01:09:09,952 --> 01:09:13,854
Uh, Rick, could you please
engage the autopilot?

958
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:16,825
Yeah, here, I got it.

959
01:09:21,964 --> 01:09:24,057
Do you think you
can fly with one hand?

960
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:28,002
Oh, baby, you'd be amazed at what
a man can do with one hand.

961
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:32,068
All right, I got this.
You go get it.

962
01:09:32,108 --> 01:09:33,700
Do your business.

963
01:09:46,055 --> 01:09:49,718
We, uh, we had no choice.
The snakes were everywhere.

964
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,522
Yeah, okay, I guess you
did what you had to do.

965
01:09:51,561 --> 01:09:53,051
Yeah.

966
01:09:55,565 --> 01:09:57,692
These aren't
North American snakes.

967
01:09:57,733 --> 01:10:00,531
So what? What does it matter?
Let's just get the antivenom

968
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:02,663
- and take it to the airport.
- No no no, these snakes aren't even

969
01:10:02,705 --> 01:10:05,139
from this continent.
They're from all over the globe.

970
01:10:05,174 --> 01:10:07,142
Only a handful
of US hospitals

971
01:10:07,176 --> 01:10:09,201
even carry
foreign antivenom.

972
01:10:11,814 --> 01:10:13,714
- How long?
- How long what?

973
01:10:13,749 --> 01:10:15,774
- How long to get the antivenom here?
- I don't know.

974
01:10:15,818 --> 01:10:17,979
At least a day,
maybe two.

975
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,079
What do we do?

976
01:10:20,122 --> 01:10:22,750
I don't know if there's anything
we can do.

977
01:10:29,332 --> 01:10:32,597
What are you drawing
there, sweetie?

978
01:10:34,237 --> 01:10:37,604
Oh, wow,
that's really good.

979
01:10:39,775 --> 01:10:42,209
I'm really sorry
about your dog.

980
01:10:43,946 --> 01:10:45,607
Thanks.

981
01:10:47,049 --> 01:10:48,880
What's up, buddy?

982
01:10:50,486 --> 01:10:54,388
Trying to get this guy to slam
the basketball. He just won't do it.

983
01:10:54,423 --> 01:10:58,189
Last month they offered
early retirement.

984
01:11:00,029 --> 01:11:02,156
But no,

985
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:05,395
this broad needed
one more tour of duty.

986
01:11:05,434 --> 01:11:08,801
You were here
for a reason.

987
01:11:08,838 --> 01:11:10,772
You saved my baby.

988
01:11:10,806 --> 01:11:13,274
That's a pretty
good reason.

989
01:11:18,047 --> 01:11:20,914
Hey, it's too--
Flynn, it's too hot.

990
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:22,918
I'm from Tennessee.
I hadn't noticed.

991
01:11:22,952 --> 01:11:24,715
Anyway, heat's the least
of our worries.

992
01:11:24,754 --> 01:11:26,881
No no no,
listen, listen.

993
01:11:26,923 --> 01:11:29,084
The air's not recycling.

994
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:30,820
He's right.

995
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:33,556
If there's no air conditioning it's
gonna get too hard to breathe.

996
01:11:33,596 --> 01:11:36,258
Shit!

997
01:11:36,299 --> 01:11:38,062
Okay,
how about the zoos?

998
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,398
How about the zoos?
I mean, zoos got snakes, right?

999
01:11:40,436 --> 01:11:42,336
So they must have
antivenom there.

1000
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:45,272
We would need a detailed list
of every species involved,

1001
01:11:45,308 --> 01:11:46,775
with that exact number.

1002
01:11:46,809 --> 01:11:51,212
And an exotic shipment like this would
only come through a dealer. So...

1003
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:52,839
All right, well, who
in Hawaii would do that?

1004
01:11:52,882 --> 01:11:56,613
And no one in Hawaii, because snakes
aren't indigenous to Hawaii.

1005
01:11:56,652 --> 01:11:58,847
But Eddie Kim lives
in LA.

1006
01:12:00,389 --> 01:12:02,357
Could he have
shopped locally?

1007
01:12:02,391 --> 01:12:06,122
Yes, only one guy could arrange this
many illegal snakes.

1008
01:12:06,162 --> 01:12:08,130
He lives out
in the desert.

1009
01:12:08,164 --> 01:12:10,257
Take us
to the heliport.

1010
01:12:10,299 --> 01:12:12,563
You don't think I know
it's hotter than hell in here?

1011
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:18,171
We also have abnormal
vibrations in engines one and two.

1012
01:12:18,207 --> 01:12:21,665
I had no choice
but to throttle back.

1013
01:12:21,711 --> 01:12:23,804
- You slowed down?
- Yeah.

1014
01:12:23,846 --> 01:12:25,814
Well, you know.

1015
01:12:25,848 --> 01:12:29,784
- It's that or option B.
- Which is?

1016
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:32,253
I go faster
and the engines seize up;

1017
01:12:32,288 --> 01:12:34,313
We eventually plummet

1018
01:12:34,357 --> 01:12:36,257
to a horrible death;

1019
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:39,659
They spend the next year
identifying femurs.

1020
01:12:40,663 --> 01:12:42,790
Okay, so just tell me

1021
01:12:42,832 --> 01:12:44,857
how to get
the AC back on.

1022
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:49,564
We've lost power
to the outflow valve motor.

1023
01:12:49,605 --> 01:12:53,041
- Which is where?
- Well, you gotta reset it manually.

1024
01:12:53,075 --> 01:12:55,873
The breaker's down
in the cargo hold.

1025
01:12:55,911 --> 01:12:58,903
Yeah.

1026
01:12:58,948 --> 01:13:01,212
Sucks to be you
right now.

1027
01:13:02,385 --> 01:13:04,080
Get off me, man!

1028
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,611
I told y'all stop touching on me
and coughing on me.

1029
01:13:06,655 --> 01:13:10,056
It's disgusting up in here.
Stay away from me.

1030
01:13:12,428 --> 01:13:14,453
Yo, how come there's no air coming
out of this piece of junk?

1031
01:13:14,497 --> 01:13:16,158
How come there's no air
coming out of here?

1032
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:18,860
Only lasts about 10 minutes after
they deploy. Now please, I need--

1033
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:20,766
Please nothing.
Get out of my face, man.

1034
01:13:20,803 --> 01:13:22,737
- If you could please just take a seat.
- Back away from me, man.

1035
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:24,603
- You sit down. Back away from me.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

1036
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,632
Back away from me.
Get up off me, man. Back up off me.

1037
01:13:27,676 --> 01:13:29,143
Hey hey hey hey.

1038
01:13:29,178 --> 01:13:31,043
I gotta get off
this plane, man.

1039
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,775
- I'm sick of this bullshit.
- Listen, brother, you got to chill.

1040
01:13:32,815 --> 01:13:34,783
- Look, just get a grip, all right?
- You get a grip, man.

1041
01:13:34,817 --> 01:13:36,375
You get-- get...

1042
01:13:36,419 --> 01:13:39,149
Hey, back up,
back up. Back up!

1043
01:13:39,188 --> 01:13:42,123
That gun goes off
in this pressurized cabin, we all die.

1044
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:44,149
Well you know what?
I want some air.

1045
01:13:44,193 --> 01:13:46,184
- What's the matter with you, Clarence?
- What's the matter with you?

1046
01:13:46,228 --> 01:13:47,718
No, what's the matter
with you, man?

1047
01:13:47,763 --> 01:13:51,529
Hey, look, you know we go back to when
we were kids, all right?

1048
01:13:51,567 --> 01:13:54,127
But I don't even
recognize you right now,

1049
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:56,297
waving a gun at all these
innocent women and children.

1050
01:13:56,338 --> 01:13:59,398
Man, there's a baby
right over there, man.

1051
01:13:59,442 --> 01:14:03,173
We're all in trouble here, dawg.
This ain't just about you.

1052
01:14:03,212 --> 01:14:05,806
Sit your ass down,
Clarence.

1053
01:14:05,848 --> 01:14:08,214
Whatever, man.

1054
01:14:13,756 --> 01:14:15,121
It's the snakes!

1055
01:14:15,157 --> 01:14:17,785
Shoot. Now what?

1056
01:14:19,795 --> 01:14:22,025
Breathe deep.

1057
01:14:24,934 --> 01:14:27,129
Oh, God, Grace.

1058
01:15:07,276 --> 01:15:08,334
Claire.

1059
01:15:10,713 --> 01:15:12,738
Claire.

1060
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:25,286
I need you
to be strong.

1061
01:15:30,533 --> 01:15:32,592
Come on.

1062
01:15:32,635 --> 01:15:35,900
- Let's go get these people some air.
- Okay.

1063
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,350
See this?

1064
01:16:00,629 --> 01:16:03,120
I went through
a pyromaniac phase as a kid.

1065
01:16:03,165 --> 01:16:05,690
- Here.
- You too, huh?

1066
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:08,396
Anything else I should
know about you?

1067
01:16:08,437 --> 01:16:10,837
Let me go with you. You don't know
your way around down there.

1068
01:16:10,873 --> 01:16:13,501
No, I need you up here.
You're my eyes and ears.

1069
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:16,170
Call me.

1070
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:18,180
Be back
soon as I can.

1071
01:16:18,214 --> 01:16:21,650
- You'd better. Be careful.
- Yeah.

1072
01:16:39,702 --> 01:16:41,670
Okay, I'm here.

1073
01:16:41,704 --> 01:16:44,673
Okay, the EAP panel
should be on your right.

1074
01:17:13,969 --> 01:17:16,733
Okay, here I go.

1075
01:17:50,673 --> 01:17:52,732
Hey, how's your boy?

1076
01:17:52,775 --> 01:17:55,266
I don't know, man.
He's in a lot of pain.

1077
01:17:57,446 --> 01:18:00,506
- Here, man, take some of this water.
- Thank you.

1078
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,645
- Hey.
- Hey.

1079
01:18:03,686 --> 01:18:07,087
- Hey, you got any water?
- Sure, yeah.

1080
01:18:07,122 --> 01:18:08,885
Thanks.

1081
01:18:08,924 --> 01:18:11,518
Look, I'm not really good at this whole
apologizing thing,

1082
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,586
but I'm sorry
about pushing you.

1083
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:16,689
It's all right.

1084
01:18:16,732 --> 01:18:19,166
You too, man.

1085
01:18:19,201 --> 01:18:21,192
That's-- that's--
that's my bad.

1086
01:18:22,838 --> 01:18:24,396
Okay, it's okay.

1087
01:18:37,086 --> 01:18:39,384
Oh...

1088
01:18:39,421 --> 01:18:42,083
looks like somebody
rigged this, uh...

1089
01:18:42,124 --> 01:18:43,557
access panel door

1090
01:18:43,592 --> 01:18:45,822
to stay open
so the snakes could get out.

1091
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:47,692
Be careful.

1092
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:51,359
All right, so where's
this outflow breaker panel

1093
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,027
you were talking about?

1094
01:18:53,068 --> 01:18:55,434
Oh, it's in the very
next compartment.

1095
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:21,161
Shit!

1096
01:19:21,196 --> 01:19:23,790
- What's going on?
- The goddamn lever's stuck.

1097
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,000
Ooh, hey!

1098
01:19:43,452 --> 01:19:45,750
Flynn, are you okay?

1099
01:19:45,788 --> 01:19:47,847
Yeah.

1100
01:20:20,923 --> 01:20:24,882
- Oh! Oh...
- Yes!

1101
01:20:24,927 --> 01:20:27,225
Okay, well,
that's a good sign.

1102
01:20:29,298 --> 01:20:31,823
Shh!

1103
01:20:31,867 --> 01:20:34,199
Do you guys
hear that?

1104
01:21:13,976 --> 01:21:16,206
Kreitler's been busted
twice by customs

1105
01:21:16,245 --> 01:21:19,772
for possession of illegal snakes.
There he is. That's him.

1106
01:21:23,418 --> 01:21:25,886
Down, down!

1107
01:21:27,289 --> 01:21:28,916
Get the door.

1108
01:21:28,957 --> 01:21:31,425
- What are you doing?
- My job.

1109
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:23,469
Area's secure.
Send in Dr. Price now.

1110
01:22:27,349 --> 01:22:30,113
Wow, that's gonna
leave a mark.

1111
01:22:33,488 --> 01:22:34,921
That's a desert
blacksnake.

1112
01:22:34,957 --> 01:22:39,121
That's indigenous
to the Middle East.

1113
01:22:39,161 --> 01:22:41,789
- Looks like you can use some antivenom.
- In the fridge.

1114
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,798
- Hurry!
- Ooh, hurry.

1115
01:22:43,832 --> 01:22:47,199
The Middle East.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Price,

1116
01:22:47,235 --> 01:22:48,793
but that would make
that snake illegal, wouldn't it?

1117
01:22:48,837 --> 01:22:50,532
Yes, yes, it would.

1118
01:22:50,572 --> 01:22:52,540
How long does that give
Mr. Mullet here to live?

1119
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:56,442
I would say
about seven minutes.

1120
01:22:56,478 --> 01:23:00,175
Seven minutes, huh?
All right, listen to me.

1121
01:23:00,215 --> 01:23:02,979
Hey, I would love
to do this whole dance, you know,

1122
01:23:03,018 --> 01:23:05,509
take a nuanced approach to interrogating
you, but the truth of it is,

1123
01:23:05,554 --> 01:23:07,454
I don't have time
to be subtle.

1124
01:23:07,489 --> 01:23:10,322
I want a list of every snake
on that plane.

1125
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:12,554
You got less
than seven minutes.

1126
01:23:12,594 --> 01:23:14,892
On the clipboard.

1127
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:17,091
- The clipboard!
- Hang on to that.

1128
01:23:19,401 --> 01:23:22,393
- Is that every snake on that plane?
- Yes.

1129
01:23:22,437 --> 01:23:24,564
- Did Eddie Kim pay you to do this?
- Yes!

1130
01:23:24,606 --> 01:23:26,335
Look, give me the shot,
God damn it.

1131
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:28,400
What are you gonna
do, call the ACLU?

1132
01:23:28,443 --> 01:23:31,310
How'd you get these guys to be so
aggressive, that's what I'm wondering.

1133
01:23:31,346 --> 01:23:32,677
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1134
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:34,341
Hey.

1135
01:23:34,383 --> 01:23:36,613
You're wasting it!

1136
01:23:36,652 --> 01:23:39,553
Pheromones. We sprayed
the flowers with it,

1137
01:23:39,588 --> 01:23:42,284
so it would circulate
in the plane's air system.

1138
01:23:42,324 --> 01:23:45,953
I swear to God.
That's it.

1139
01:23:53,068 --> 01:23:56,060
Okay.
All right.

1140
01:23:58,407 --> 01:24:00,671
Bring in Eddie Kim. Charge him
with multiple counts of murder

1141
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:04,008
and attempted murder and get that
piece-of-shit attorney on the phone.

1142
01:24:04,046 --> 01:24:06,537
Yeah, tell him to ask Kim
what his preference is.

1143
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:09,209
Gas or lethal injection.

1144
01:24:18,493 --> 01:24:20,688
Oh, thank God.

1145
01:24:22,097 --> 01:24:24,998
Flynn, it's Harris.

1146
01:24:30,305 --> 01:24:32,603
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1147
01:24:32,641 --> 01:24:35,838
Yeah.

1148
01:24:35,877 --> 01:24:38,744
Outstanding.
All right.

1149
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:41,715
Everybody, listen,
they have the antivenom.

1150
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:44,719
It's gonna be waiting
for us when we land in LA.

1151
01:24:44,753 --> 01:24:48,052
Hear that, little man?
Your brother's gonna be fine.

1152
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:51,619
It's all up
to the pilot now.

1153
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:54,151
I'll go give him
the good news.

1154
01:24:54,196 --> 01:24:56,221
Rick.

1155
01:24:56,264 --> 01:24:58,357
Rick.

1156
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,062
Rick, open the door.

1157
01:25:01,103 --> 01:25:03,333
What's going on?

1158
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:06,033
He's not answering.

1159
01:25:06,074 --> 01:25:07,803
Rick!

1160
01:25:18,386 --> 01:25:20,286
- Ho!
- Oh my God!

1161
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:24,554
Get him up!

1162
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:34,833
Uh...

1163
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:36,838
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this:

1164
01:25:36,872 --> 01:25:39,500
Is there anyone here
who knows how

1165
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:41,771
to fly a plane?

1166
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:43,539
Claire, Claire, I'll do it.

1167
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:45,068
I'm sure the tower
can talk me through it.

1168
01:25:45,113 --> 01:25:48,514
No no no, Flynn.
I know who could land this plane.

1169
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:50,677
- Who?
- Him.

1170
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,710
Yeah, you.
Come on, Troy.

1171
01:25:53,755 --> 01:25:55,723
You know you can
do this, man.

1172
01:25:55,757 --> 01:25:58,317
Come on,
take us home, dawg.

1173
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,725
You know how to fly?

1174
01:25:59,761 --> 01:26:01,490
Hey, man,

1175
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:04,260
I got over
2,000 hours.

1176
01:26:04,299 --> 01:26:06,529
This is all you've
talked about.

1177
01:26:06,568 --> 01:26:08,763
Troy, you can do this.

1178
01:26:08,804 --> 01:26:10,669
Yeah yeah yeah.

1179
01:26:10,705 --> 01:26:12,730
Yeah, I can do this.

1180
01:26:14,075 --> 01:26:15,542
We gotta clear the snakes
out of the cockpit.

1181
01:26:15,577 --> 01:26:17,568
Yeah yeah, clear the snakes
out of the cockpit, yeah.

1182
01:26:19,247 --> 01:26:21,215
Enough is enough!

1183
01:26:21,249 --> 01:26:23,843
I have had it with these
motherfucking snakes

1184
01:26:23,885 --> 01:26:26,353
on this
motherfucking plane!

1185
01:26:26,388 --> 01:26:28,549
Everybody strap in.

1186
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:31,115
I'm about to open
some fucking windows!

1187
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:48,672
Take this.

1188
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:51,702
Tie it
to the cockpit door.

1189
01:26:52,848 --> 01:26:54,975
Let's go.

1190
01:27:08,964 --> 01:27:11,432
Listen, when the windows
go out, the cabin's gonna lose pressure

1191
01:27:11,466 --> 01:27:13,593
and oxygen. You gotta get us down
as fast as you can.

1192
01:27:13,635 --> 01:27:15,432
All right,
everybody make sure

1193
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,700
you're strapped in
as securely as possible.

1194
01:27:17,739 --> 01:27:19,707
Remember,
it's going to be loud,

1195
01:27:19,741 --> 01:27:21,936
and it's going to
be cold.

1196
01:27:21,977 --> 01:27:24,502
Hold your breath
as long as you can, all right?

1197
01:27:24,546 --> 01:27:27,071
And protect your head.
Use your arms.

1198
01:27:27,115 --> 01:27:28,742
Is everybody ready?

1199
01:27:28,783 --> 01:27:31,251
- Ready to do this?
- Let's do it.

1200
01:27:31,286 --> 01:27:33,447
All right,
take the position.

1201
01:27:36,358 --> 01:27:39,259
One, two,

1202
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:42,388
three.

1203
01:28:00,482 --> 01:28:02,313
Do it now!

1204
01:28:15,397 --> 01:28:17,388
Let's go!

1205
01:28:39,321 --> 01:28:41,551
Hit that autopilot switch
for me.

1206
01:28:45,393 --> 01:28:48,362
Whoo, whoo! That's what I'm
talking about, boy!

1207
01:28:48,396 --> 01:28:51,729
This shit is bananas!

1208
01:29:11,519 --> 01:29:14,454
Hold on!
Hold on!

1209
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,255
Come on, baby!

1210
01:29:22,897 --> 01:29:24,194
Come on, push.

1211
01:29:43,718 --> 01:29:45,549
Yeah, right about there.

1212
01:29:45,587 --> 01:29:47,612
Okay,
we're leveling out.

1213
01:29:51,393 --> 01:29:53,953
You okay?

1214
01:29:59,467 --> 01:30:01,935
Troy, the plane's not level.
It's not level!

1215
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:05,906
Yeah yeah, I know that the plane
is not level, okay okay?

1216
01:30:06,975 --> 01:30:08,602
Gimme a break, man.

1217
01:30:11,846 --> 01:30:13,313
All right, whassup?
Whassup, y'all?

1218
01:30:13,348 --> 01:30:15,043
What it is.
What it is!

1219
01:30:15,083 --> 01:30:18,143
This is your new pilot Troy speaking,
and sitting next to me

1220
01:30:18,186 --> 01:30:21,519
is my main man,
my brother from another mother,

1221
01:30:21,556 --> 01:30:24,889
the biggest pimp
that I know, Superfly Agent Flynn.

1222
01:30:24,926 --> 01:30:26,826
Ladies and gentlemen,
Agent Flynn.

1223
01:30:30,532 --> 01:30:34,298
Sir, have you got any experience
piloting a jet aircraft?

1224
01:30:34,335 --> 01:30:37,395
Oh, yeah, F-15s,
F-16s,

1225
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:39,339
A-10 Warthogs,
I've flown all that shit.

1226
01:30:39,374 --> 01:30:41,706
Then we're all thankful
to have you, sir.

1227
01:30:41,743 --> 01:30:45,179
- What squadron were you with?
- The Awesome Fighting Aces.

1228
01:30:45,213 --> 01:30:47,181
Man, I'm telling you,
them video gamers

1229
01:30:47,215 --> 01:30:49,513
got their shit
locked down tight.

1230
01:30:49,551 --> 01:30:51,519
Sir, are you
telling me

1231
01:30:51,553 --> 01:30:53,521
that your only real
flight time is

1232
01:30:53,555 --> 01:30:55,455
at the controls
of a video game?

1233
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:57,481
No, see,

1234
01:30:57,525 --> 01:31:00,517
it's-- it's not a video game, all right?
It's a flight simulator.

1235
01:31:00,562 --> 01:31:04,293
- Is that a PlayStation or Xbox?
- PlayStation 2.

1236
01:31:04,332 --> 01:31:06,960
Man, it's got an introduction by
Chuck Yeager and everything.

1237
01:31:07,001 --> 01:31:10,095
Look, Flynn, man,
I can do this.

1238
01:31:10,138 --> 01:31:12,834
Trust me.

1239
01:31:12,874 --> 01:31:14,933
Look, LAX, just give
me my VOR numbers

1240
01:31:14,976 --> 01:31:17,035
and my approach vectors,
and I'll be fine.

1241
01:31:17,078 --> 01:31:20,138
Sir, I suggest you relinquish
the pilot's chair

1242
01:31:20,181 --> 01:31:23,014
to someone more
experienced.

1243
01:31:23,051 --> 01:31:25,349
This is Agent
Neville Flynn, FBI.

1244
01:31:25,386 --> 01:31:27,820
You are talking
to the only person

1245
01:31:27,856 --> 01:31:29,517
up here who has
that experience.

1246
01:31:29,557 --> 01:31:31,525
I suggest you give him
what he needs

1247
01:31:31,559 --> 01:31:33,652
so we can
land this thing.

1248
01:31:33,695 --> 01:31:35,663
Oh!

1249
01:31:35,697 --> 01:31:37,722
Oh!

1250
01:31:37,765 --> 01:31:40,825
So, uh, you are
pretty good at this game, right?

1251
01:31:40,869 --> 01:31:43,201
Yes, man.
No problem.

1252
01:31:43,238 --> 01:31:45,832
Well, I mean, my older brother Randy
has got the high score,

1253
01:31:45,874 --> 01:31:47,569
but I'm good.

1254
01:31:47,609 --> 01:31:51,409
Asshole never lets me
hear the end of it.

1255
01:31:51,446 --> 01:31:53,880
LAX tower,
this is Hula 1-2-1.

1256
01:31:53,915 --> 01:31:56,782
Requesting clearance for landing.
Please advice which runway.

1257
01:31:56,818 --> 01:31:58,615
Hula 1-2-1, heavy,

1258
01:31:58,653 --> 01:32:00,746
we're in the process
of clearing all the runways,

1259
01:32:00,788 --> 01:32:02,813
but you got a strong tailwind.
Advise, come around

1260
01:32:02,857 --> 01:32:04,882
and use runway
2-4-left.

1261
01:32:04,926 --> 01:32:07,258
No no no, negative, tower.
I can't do that.

1262
01:32:07,295 --> 01:32:09,559
I don't have time
for westbound orientation.

1263
01:32:09,597 --> 01:32:11,588
Look, I got a lot
of injured passengers up here

1264
01:32:11,633 --> 01:32:13,601
who need help
immediately.

1265
01:32:13,635 --> 01:32:16,900
You try to land west to east,
you'll come in too fast to control.

1266
01:32:16,938 --> 01:32:19,099
Well, then I suggest you
speed up clearing the rest

1267
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,870
of the runways, 'cause my ass
is coming in for a landing!

1268
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:30,611
All right, brace yourselves,
you guys, this is it.

1269
01:32:33,821 --> 01:32:36,153
Everybody
brace yourselves!

1270
01:32:41,563 --> 01:32:43,087
Here we go.

1271
01:33:01,316 --> 01:33:03,409
Brakes!
Brakes, Troy!

1272
01:33:03,451 --> 01:33:06,386
- Put your ass in it!
- This part ain't in the game.

1273
01:33:06,421 --> 01:33:08,651
Is crashing part
of the game, huh?

1274
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:11,818
I don't know, man. I usually just hit
reset and start the level over.

1275
01:33:11,859 --> 01:33:13,793
Oh, shit, left!

1276
01:33:13,828 --> 01:33:17,594
Left! Turn this big
motherfucker left, Troy!

1277
01:33:38,353 --> 01:33:40,412
Whoo!

1278
01:33:49,864 --> 01:33:51,593
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1279
01:33:51,633 --> 01:33:53,897
All praises
to the PlayStation.

1280
01:33:53,935 --> 01:33:55,800
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1281
01:33:55,837 --> 01:33:57,805
That's my boy, Troy, yes!

1282
01:33:59,974 --> 01:34:01,441
Hell, yeah!

1283
01:34:01,476 --> 01:34:04,445
Whose house is this?
Troy's house, that's right.

1284
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:06,572
Fuck Randy!
Fuck Randy and his high score.

1285
01:34:06,614 --> 01:34:08,809
That's my own brother,
and I say, "Fuck him!"

1286
01:34:14,822 --> 01:34:17,347
Man, my ass.

1287
01:34:17,392 --> 01:34:19,622
My ass, man.

1288
01:34:19,661 --> 01:34:21,390
Okay, let's get going.

1289
01:34:24,832 --> 01:34:26,823
Over here!
Got them!

1290
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,831
Okay, everybody.

1291
01:35:00,702 --> 01:35:03,535
Thank you!

1292
01:35:23,491 --> 01:35:25,482
Hey, Doc, thank you.

1293
01:35:25,526 --> 01:35:27,585
And hey, good luck with
those Antiguan racers.

1294
01:35:27,628 --> 01:35:29,357
It was nice working
with you, Agent.

1295
01:35:29,397 --> 01:35:31,024
Please help!
Help please!

1296
01:35:31,065 --> 01:35:33,499
- This boy is unconscious.
- Keep that close, all right?

1297
01:35:33,534 --> 01:35:35,661
He needs oxygen
right away.

1298
01:35:37,538 --> 01:35:40,234
Did anyone see the snake
that bit this boy?

1299
01:35:40,274 --> 01:35:42,139
- Show 'em, sweetie. It's okay.
- What is it?

1300
01:35:42,176 --> 01:35:44,770
I couldn't find the snake
that bit him, so I drew a picture.

1301
01:35:44,812 --> 01:35:46,541
It's a cobra, right,
like Indiana Jones?

1302
01:35:46,581 --> 01:35:49,550
That's excellent.
Lactin and Ringer's solution, 25ml.

1303
01:35:49,584 --> 01:35:51,279
I'll do the antivenom.

1304
01:35:56,924 --> 01:35:58,949
Sean.

1305
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:08,699
Before everything gets crazy out there,
I wanna say thanks.

1306
01:36:08,736 --> 01:36:10,761
Couldn't have done
this without you.

1307
01:36:12,974 --> 01:36:14,669
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1308
01:36:14,709 --> 01:36:17,701
Let's lock this guy up
who tried to kill us.

1309
01:36:27,054 --> 01:36:28,646
Give him a hand!

1310
01:36:37,231 --> 01:36:39,631
Down down down.

1311
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:48,971
couldn't breathe.

1312
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:51,501
- You all right? Come on.
- Yeah.

1313
01:36:51,546 --> 01:36:54,947
- Come on.
- Oh, man.

1314
01:36:58,352 --> 01:37:01,219
Nice.
Stings like shit, huh?

1315
01:37:01,255 --> 01:37:03,416
Yeah.

1316
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:06,256
This is Agent Harris,
the guy on the other end of the phone.

1317
01:37:06,294 --> 01:37:08,159
It's an honor.

1318
01:37:10,331 --> 01:37:13,562
Kenny, baby.
Oh my God.

1319
01:37:13,601 --> 01:37:15,831
Oh my God!

1320
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,799
Oh! Oh, I'm gonna
get you home.

1321
01:37:21,843 --> 01:37:25,472
Come on, let's go.
My little cowgirl.

1322
01:37:34,155 --> 01:37:36,350
Claire.

1323
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:39,587
- Hey.
- Um...

1324
01:37:39,627 --> 01:37:42,960
now that you've saved my life,
I think I kind of owe you a dinner

1325
01:37:42,997 --> 01:37:45,022
to show my
appreciation.

1326
01:37:46,334 --> 01:37:49,098
Well, I would very much
like to take you up on that.

1327
01:37:49,136 --> 01:37:51,502
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

1328
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:57,075
- Call me.
- Will do.

1329
01:38:03,551 --> 01:38:06,577
- Sean, hey.
- Hey.

1330
01:38:08,523 --> 01:38:10,718
Oh, damn.

1331
01:38:16,831 --> 01:38:19,459
I'll definitely call you.

1332
01:38:21,869 --> 01:38:24,303
Thank you.

1333
01:38:26,274 --> 01:38:28,333
How do you like flying
in first class?

1334
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:34,043
Do you remember the first
thing you ever told me?

1335
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:36,481
What the fuck's that got
to do with anything?

1336
01:38:36,517 --> 01:38:39,111
What was the first thing
you ever told me?

1337
01:38:41,222 --> 01:38:43,884
Do as I say
and you live.

1338
01:38:43,925 --> 01:38:46,723
Exactly.
Now it's your turn.

1339
01:38:46,761 --> 01:38:49,525
Do as I say,
and you live.

1340
01:38:49,564 --> 01:38:51,429
# Blue skies,
party people #

1341
01:38:51,465 --> 01:38:54,059
# Out on the beach
you got the burning show #

1342
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:56,160
# We keep on rockin'
till the early morn' #

1343
01:38:56,203 --> 01:38:58,433
# I say, hey now, now #

1344
01:38:58,472 --> 01:39:01,805
# Come on,
I say, hey now, now #

1345
01:39:01,842 --> 01:39:04,504
# Don't try to keep 'em
if they got to go #

1346
01:39:04,545 --> 01:39:06,672
# I wanna keep 'em
till the early morn' #

1347
01:39:06,714 --> 01:39:09,046
# I say, hey now, now #

1348
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:10,948
# I say,
hey now, now #

1349
01:39:10,985 --> 01:39:12,816
# Spearhead in the area #

1350
01:39:12,853 --> 01:39:15,583
# You really so the girl #

1351
01:39:15,623 --> 01:39:18,558
# And I would do
anything for you #

1352
01:39:19,994 --> 01:39:22,462
# It's true,
it's true #

1353
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,588
# Come on,
I wanna-- #

1354
01:39:43,985 --> 01:39:46,453
That's it! I have had it

1355
01:39:46,487 --> 01:39:48,546
with these
motherfucking snakes

1356
01:39:48,589 --> 01:39:51,683
on this motherfucking
plane!

1357
01:39:51,726 --> 01:39:54,126
# Times are strange #

1358
01:39:54,161 --> 01:39:57,255
# We got a free upgrade
for snakes on a plane #

1359
01:39:57,298 --> 01:40:01,029
# Fuck 'em,
I don't care #

1360
01:40:01,068 --> 01:40:02,660
# Pop the cheap champagne #

1361
01:40:02,703 --> 01:40:05,103
# We're going down
in flames, hey #

1362
01:40:05,139 --> 01:40:07,039
# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1363
01:40:07,074 --> 01:40:08,473
# Come on, bring it #

1364
01:40:08,509 --> 01:40:10,500
# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1365
01:40:10,544 --> 01:40:12,011
# Come on, bring it #

1366
01:40:12,046 --> 01:40:13,946

01:40:13,981 --> 01:40:15,039

1368
01:40:15,082 --> 01:40:17,050
# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1369
01:40:17,084 --> 01:40:20,918
- # Come on, bring it #
- # So kiss me goodbye #

1370
01:40:20,955 --> 01:40:24,118
# Honey, I'm gonna
make it out alive #

1371
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:28,185
# So kiss me goodbye #

1372
01:40:28,229 --> 01:40:31,995
# I can see the venom
in their eyes #

1373
01:40:32,033 --> 01:40:34,900
# Goodbye #

1374
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:42,109
# It's time to fly #

1375
01:40:42,143 --> 01:40:45,544
# To make the skies alive,
is it serpentine #

1376
01:40:45,579 --> 01:40:49,413
# Lounging in their
suits and ties #

1377
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:53,511
# Watch the whores parade
for the price of fame, hey #

1378
01:40:53,554 --> 01:40:55,522
# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1379
01:40:55,556 --> 01:40:56,750
# Come on, bring it #

1380
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:58,725
# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1381
01:40:58,759 --> 01:41:00,124

# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1385
01:41:05,533 --> 01:41:09,469
- # Come on, bring it #
- # So kiss me goodbye #

1386
01:41:09,503 --> 01:41:12,597

01:41:32,026 --> 01:41:35,257
# In their eyes,
goodbye #

1394
01:41:35,296 --> 01:41:38,094
# Ladies and gentlemen,
the snakes are slithering #

1395
01:41:38,132 --> 01:41:41,568
# With dollar signs in their eyes,
with tongues so reptilian #

1396
01:41:41,602 --> 01:41:45,038
# This industry's venomous
with cold-blooded sentiment #

1397
01:41:45,072 --> 01:41:46,699
# No need for nervousness #

1398
01:41:46,741 --> 01:41:48,868
# It's just
a little turbulence #

1399
01:41:54,215 --> 01:41:57,309
# So kiss me goodbye #

1400
01:41:57,351 --> 01:42:00,878
# Honey, I'm gonna
make it out alive #

1405
01:42:15,202 --> 01:42:18,729

1406
01:42:18,773 --> 01:42:20,536
# I can see the venom #

1407
01:42:20,574 --> 01:42:23,168
# In their eyes,
goodbye #

1408
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:25,144
# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1409
01:42:25,179 --> 01:42:26,441
# Come on, bring it #

1410
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,641
# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1411
01:42:28,682 --> 01:42:30,172
# Come on, bring it #

1412
01:42:30,217 --> 01:42:32,082
# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1413
01:42:32,119 --> 01:42:33,518
# Come on, bring it #

1414
01:42:33,554 --> 01:42:35,317
# Oh, I'm ready for it #

1415
01:42:35,356 --> 01:42:37,881
# Come on, bring it. #

1416
01:42:37,925 --> 01:42:41,622
We seem to be losing altitude
at an alarming pace.

1417
01:42:41,662 --> 01:42:43,960
From midtown
to downtown,

1418
01:42:43,998 --> 01:42:46,398
snakes on a block.

1419
01:42:46,433 --> 01:42:48,526
I suggest you grab
your ankles

1420
01:42:48,569 --> 01:42:50,560
and kiss
your ass goodbye.

1421
01:42:56,844 --> 01:42:59,779
# That visibly a vagabond #

1422
01:42:59,814 --> 01:43:01,543
# Yeah, just tag along #

1423
01:43:01,582 --> 01:43:03,311
# Not one single care
in the world #

1424
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:05,215
# Not even any carry on #

1425
01:43:05,252 --> 01:43:06,810
# They say there's
a future ahead so #

1426
01:43:06,854 --> 01:43:08,549
# I wanna fly out there
and see #

1427
01:43:08,589 --> 01:43:10,420
# I just smiled
and said hello #

1428
01:43:10,457 --> 01:43:12,254
# And sat right next
to Destiny #

1429
01:43:12,293 --> 01:43:14,261
# I leaned over
and asked him #

1430
01:43:14,295 --> 01:43:15,990
# Would we be okay? #

1431
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:18,658
# He said that he wasn't
at liberty to say #

1432
01:43:18,699 --> 01:43:23,159
# Send me an angel,
an angel #

1433
01:43:23,204 --> 01:43:26,503
# The sign of the times,
he said, but take it in vain #

1434
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:30,237
# I'm no stranger
to danger #

1435
01:43:30,277 --> 01:43:32,040
# But I'm scared
'cause I swore #

1436
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:34,047
# I saw a snake
on the plane #

1437
01:43:34,081 --> 01:43:36,709
# I'm tired of these
motherfucking snakes #

1438
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,741
# On this motherfucking
plane #

1439
01:43:38,786 --> 01:43:41,220
# I'm tired, I'm tired,
I'm tired #

1440
01:43:41,255 --> 01:43:43,723
# I'm tired of these
motherfucking snakes #

1441
01:43:43,757 --> 01:43:45,657
# On this
motherfucking plane #

1442
01:43:45,693 --> 01:43:48,093
# I'm tired, I'm tired,
I'm tired #

1443
01:43:48,128 --> 01:43:51,996
# Send me an angel,
an angel #

1444
01:43:52,032 --> 01:43:55,468
# The sign of the times,
he said, but take it in vain #

1445
01:43:55,502 --> 01:43:58,960
# I'm no stranger
to danger #

1446
01:43:59,006 --> 01:44:00,871
# But I'm scared
'cause I swore #

1447
01:44:00,908 --> 01:44:03,399
# I saw a snake
on the plane. #

1448
01:44:26,467 --> 01:44:29,061
# Snakes on the brain #

1449
01:44:29,103 --> 01:44:30,502
# Don't throw up signs #

1450
01:44:30,537 --> 01:44:33,131
# That don't land planes #

1451
01:44:33,173 --> 01:44:34,538
# It's a risky game #

1452
01:44:34,575 --> 01:44:37,009
# You don't want
us to play #

1453
01:44:37,044 --> 01:44:38,944
# I hate the player #

1454
01:44:38,979 --> 01:44:41,447
# And I hate the game #

1455
01:44:41,482 --> 01:44:44,144
# 'Cause it's nature's
game #

1456
01:44:45,419 --> 01:44:47,944
# You've got
to let it go #

1457
01:44:47,988 --> 01:44:49,956
# You've got to let it go #

1458
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:52,481
# All your fantasies #

1459
01:44:52,526 --> 01:44:54,426
# Will fuck you up #

1460
01:44:54,461 --> 01:44:56,622
# Don't let the snakes
coil up #

1461
01:44:56,664 --> 01:44:58,996
# Around your neck #

1462
01:44:59,033 --> 01:45:01,297
# Before you land
the plane #

1463
01:45:01,335 --> 01:45:04,498
# Before you win
the game #

1464
01:45:11,745 --> 01:45:14,441
# Snakes on the brain #

1465
01:45:16,350 --> 01:45:18,944
# Snakes on the brain #

1466
01:45:20,921 --> 01:45:23,481
# Snakes on the brain. #
