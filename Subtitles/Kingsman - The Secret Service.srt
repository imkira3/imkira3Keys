00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:41,486
<i>This is Zero One Alpha.</i>

3
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:46,219
<i>We have secured Falcon.
I say again, we have secured Falcon.</i>

4
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,220
By the time I count to ten...

5
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,900
you will have told me exactly
what I need to know.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,047
If not the number ten will be
the last thing you will ever hear.

7
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,943
One, two,

8
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,308
three, four,

9
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,682
five, six,

10
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,463
seven, eight...

11
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,078
Grenade! Sir, get back!

12
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,730
Shit.

13
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,260
Fucking missed it.

14
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:27,263
How did I fucking miss it?

15
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:29,955
Merlin...

16
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:32,839
I apologize for putting you
in this position.

17
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,370
You trained him well.

18
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:36,940
James...

19
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:41,141
training is over.

20
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,414
Welcome to Kingsman...

21
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:47,381
- Lancelot.
- Sir.

22
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,781
I'll deal with this mess... personally.

23
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,899
<i>I very much regret that your husband's
bravery can't be publicly celebrated.</i>

24
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:04,400
I hope you understand.

25
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,804
How can I understand?
He won't tell me anything.

26
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:11,852
I didn't even know
he wasn't with his squad.

27
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:14,665
I'm so sorry, I can't say more.

28
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,013
But I would like to present you
with this Medal of Valor.

29
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:20,950
And if you look closely
on the back, there's a number.

30
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,325
As a more concrete gesture
of our gratitude, we'd like to offer you...

31
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:28,524
Let's call it a favor.

32
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:31,661
The nature of it is your choice.
Just tell the operator,

33
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:35,496
"Oxfords not brogues,"
and then I'll know it's you.

34
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,619
I don't want your help.

35
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,970
I want my husband back.

36
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,582
- What's your name, young man?
- Eggsy.

37
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:55,066
Hello, Eggsy.

38
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:57,240
Can I see that?

39
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:06,229
You take care of this, Eggsy.

40
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,162
All right?

41
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,412
And take care of your mum, too.

42
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,613
So sorry, Professor Arnold.
Just a tiny bit more.

43
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:00,550
Oh, for God's sakes, just rip it off.

44
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,387
I'm under very strict instructions
not to hurt you.

45
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:08,290
Look, you've made a mistake.
I'm a university lecturer.

46
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,027
- I've got no money.
- This isn't about money.

47
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:15,298
- Our boss just wants to talk to you.
- Am I meant to find that reassuring?

48
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,649
He'll be here soon. He'll explain.

49
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:23,704
Do you like whiskey?
Red, get the '62 Dalmore.

50
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,111
Honestly, this whiskey, it's amazing.

51
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,516
You will shit.

52
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,900
I suppose asking to borrow
a cup of sugar is a step too far.

53
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,727
Professor Arnold...
I'm here to take you home.

54
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,936
1962 Dalmore.

55
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,449
It'd be a sin to spill any.

56
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:37,625
Don't you think?

57
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,947
Can you hold these? Please?

58
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:36,042
Thank you.

59
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:43,538
Everything is clean.

60
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:52,452
My kind of welcome.

61
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:02,428
No stomach for violence.
I mean, literally.

62
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:05,785
I see one drop of blood,
that is me done.

63
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,596
I'm like... projectile.

64
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:14,243
Listen, I'm so sorry you had
to witness all this unpleasantness,

65
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:16,509
due to our uninvited guest.

66
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:20,917
But I promise you, by the time
I've found out who he works for,

67
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:26,086
<i>you and I will be the best of friends.</i>

68
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:34,128
To the shop, please.

69
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:59,832
Arthur's in the dining room, sir.

70
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:11,809
- Arthur.
- Galahad.

71
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:16,570
The others were beginning to wonder
if we were going to have a double toast.

72
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:22,440
Gentlemen, I'm thankful to say
it's been 17 years

73
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,515
since we last had occasion
to use this decanter.

74
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:30,952
Lancelot... was an outstanding agent
and a true Kingsman.

75
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:33,589
He will be sorely missed.

76
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,758
To Lancelot.

77
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,991
To Lancelot.

78
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:46,803
I intend to start the selection process
for Lancelot's replacement tomorrow.

79
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:51,674
I want each of you to propose a candidate
and have them report to UKHQ

80
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:55,476
no later than 9:00 p.m. GMT. Thank you.

81
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:01,551
Merlin. Come in.

82
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:04,787
Lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries

83
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:07,490
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry.

84
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,839
Glasses, gentlemen, please.

85
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,347
Uganda, 2012. Synthetic cathinones.

86
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:18,302
They put it in the water supply
of a guerilla army base...

87
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:23,080
rage, cannibalism, multiple fatalities.

88
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:27,243
Chechnya, 2013.
Insurgents turned on one another.

89
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,980
Indisputably, the work of our mercenaries,
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

90
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,243
So what happened to Lancelot?

91
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,285
He tracked them to this property
in Argentina.

92
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,601
While he had them under surveillance,
he became aware

93
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:40,662
they'd effected a kidnapping.

94
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:44,861
So he executed a solo rescue mission,
which failed.

95
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,194
This is his last transmission.

96
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:51,567
- Who is he?
- Some climate-change doomsayer,

97
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:55,304
expounds something called Gaia theory
about the world healing itself or some such.

98
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,208
But what's curious
is he's not actually missing.

99
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,347
This is Professor Arnold...

100
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,203
at Imperial College this morning.

101
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,039
It's all yours.

102
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,679
And don't forget
your membership proposal.

103
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,722
Try picking a more suitable
candidate this time.

104
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,503
17 years,

105
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:18,544
and still evolving with the times remains
an entirely foreign concept to you.

106
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,031
Need I remind you I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for that young man?

107
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:26,101
He was as much Kingsman material
as any of them. More so.

108
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:29,171
But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he?

109
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:33,507
Let's face it, Galahad,
your little experiment failed.

110
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:37,813
With respect, Arthur, you're a snob.

111
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,048
With respect?

112
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:42,564
The world is changing.

113
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:46,519
There's a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins.

114
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,277
Eggsy?

115
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:11,305
Eggsy, come here.

116
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:15,201
- Got any Rizla, babe?
- No.

117
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,586
Why don't you do your mum a favor,
go down to the shop and get some?

118
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:18,888
- Get them yourself.
- Oi.

119
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,857
What have I said to you
about speaking to Dean like that?

120
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:25,506
Three's a crowd, isn't it?
Why don't Dean's poodle go?

121
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:29,031
I'll tell you what. Why don't you take this,
go and get some Rizlas,

122
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:31,957
get yourself some sweets...
and while you're gone,

123
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:34,988
we'll show your mother
how three can be good company.

124
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:39,603
Thanks, babe.

125
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,109
Come here.

126
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:48,368
There we go.

127
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,150
Is that better?

128
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,469
If Dean treats your mum so bad,
why don't she leave him?

129
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:09,638
Low self-esteem, that's her problem.

130
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:13,645
Fuck off. Why would she have
low self-esteem? Eggsy's mum is well fit.

131
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:16,388
- No offense, bruv.
- It's all right.

132
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:19,281
One of these days,
I'm gonna smash his face in.

133
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,956
Are you mental, cuz?

134
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:25,046
He'd just get that lot to do you
and then pretend he knew nothing...

135
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,651
about it.

136
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:29,795
Oi! You think you can chat shit
about us and we won't do nothing

137
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,294
just 'cause our guvnor's
banging Eggsy's mum?

138
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,244
Pretty much, yeah.

139
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:37,482
Bruv, just leave it. Let's just go, man.
It's not worth it.

140
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:40,169
You boys have outstayed your welcome.

141
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:42,679
Leave.

142
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:45,090
What?

143
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,507
I'm sorry about that, bruv.

144
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:52,915
Yeah. Mug.

145
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:57,022
They weren't fucking worth it, boys.

146
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:01,056
It's freezing. Why are we walking?

147
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:05,694
- You jacked his fucking car keys, bruv?
- Yeah. Now we're gonna nick his car.

148
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:08,862
- Fucking...
- Shit. Move, bruv!

149
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,643
Hold on, boys.

150
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,743
Hey, that's my fucking car! Hey! Hey!

151
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:23,895
Eggsy, I swear,
you want to fucking stop it!

152
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,413
You're a fucking dead man! Stop it!

153
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:31,477
I'm gonna fuckin' have ya!

154
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:35,244
Come on.

155
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:37,925
Floor it, Eggsy! Floor it!

156
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:41,128
Wanker!

157
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:45,834
Yeah, yeah, Dean, look, it's me.
Eggsy just stole my fucking car, yeah.

158
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,953
Yeah, I've come out the pub,
he's done about 15 doughnuts

159
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,466
in my fucking face, and he's drove off.

160
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:55,255
No, I can't have it! He's disrespecting me,
and that means he's disrespecting you.

161
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:57,876
Oh, hold up! What the...

162
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,195
Come on, Eggsy!

163
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:40,447
Dickhead.

164
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:45,460
Foxes are vermin, cuz.
Should've driven it over.

165
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,164
Should've done a lot of things.
I'll sort this. Get out of the car.

166
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:51,898
I said, get out of the fucking car!

167
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,879
Eggsy, there is no such thing
as honor amongst thieves.

168
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:09,184
Now, you can start giving me some names
of the boys you were with,

169
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:12,721
or you go down. It's up to you.

170
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,861
I want to exercise my right
to a phone call.

171
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,976
Well... I hope it's to your mum,

172
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:25,581
to tell her you're gonna be
18 months late for your dinner.

173
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:59,267
<i>Customer Complaints, how may I help you?</i>

174
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:03,438
My name's Eggsy Unwin.
Sorry, Gary Unwin.

175
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:05,807
And... I'm up shit creek.

176
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:08,610
I'm in Holborn police station,
and my mum said to call this number

177
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,880
- if ever I needed help and...
- <i>I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number.</i>

178
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,250
Wait! Wait!

179
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,484
Oxfords not brogues?

180
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,689
<i>Your complaint has been duly noted,</i>

181
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,327
<i>and we hope that we have not
lost you as a loyal customer.</i>

182
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:37,106
Yeah.

183
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:39,708
You what?

184
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:43,545
I... Yeah.

185
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,646
Yes, I totally understand.

186
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:07,841
Eggsy.

187
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:09,735
Would you like a lift home?

188
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,424
- Who are you?
- The man who got you released.

189
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,845
- That ain't an answer.
- A little gratitude would be nice.

190
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:20,847
My name is Harry Hart,
and I gave you that medal.

191
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:25,051
Your father saved my life.

192
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:29,891
So before you was a tailor,
was you in the army?

193
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,428
- Like an officer?
- Not quite.

194
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:35,397
So where was you posted,
Iraq or something?

195
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:38,271
Sorry, Eggsy, classified.

196
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:41,415
But my dad saved your life, yeah?

197
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:45,806
The day your father died,
I missed something.

198
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,507
And if it weren't for his courage,
my mistake would've cost the lives

199
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,287
of every man present.

200
00:18:51,286 --> 00:18:53,342
So I owe him.

201
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:56,485
Your father was a brave man.

202
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,137
A good man.

203
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:01,690
And having read your files,
I think he'd be bitterly disappointed

204
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,159
- in the choices you've made.
- You can't talk to me like that.

205
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,012
Huge IQ, great performance
at primary school...

206
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:12,301
and it all went tits up.
Drugs, petty crime, never had a job.

207
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,236
Oh, you think there's a lot of jobs
going around here, do you?

208
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:15,904
Doesn't explain why
you gave up your hobbies.

209
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:20,142
First prize, regional Under-10s
gymnastics two years in a row.

210
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,411
Your coach had you pegged
as Olympic team material.

211
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,313
Yeah, well, when you grow up
around someone like my stepdad,

212
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,583
- you pick up new hobbies pretty quick.
- Of course. Always someone else's fault.

213
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,153
Who's to blame for you
quitting the Marines?

214
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,588
You were halfway through training,
doing brilliantly, but you gave up.

215
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:35,824
Because my mum went mental.

216
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,827
Banging on about losing me
as well as my dad.

217
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,380
Didn't want me being cannon fodder
for snobs like you!

218
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,624
Judging people like me

219
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:46,201
from your ivory towers with no thought
about why we do what we do.

220
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:49,738
We ain't got much choice. You get me?

221
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,307
And if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses,

222
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,327
we'd do just as well as you...
if not better.

223
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,144
What the fuck you doing here?
You taking the piss?

224
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,934
Some more examples of young men
who simply need a silver suppository?

225
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:06,255
- No, they're exceptions. Come on.
- Nonsense. We haven't finished our drinks.

226
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,991
After you nicked his car,
Dean says you're fair game.

227
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:12,025
- He don't give a shit what your mum says.
- Listen, boys...

228
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,530
I've had a rather emotional day,

229
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,901
so whatever your beef with Eggsy is,
and I'm sure it's well-founded,

230
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:23,672
I'd appreciate it enormously
if you could just leave us in peace

231
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:26,676
until I finish this lovely pint
of Guinness.

232
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:32,514
You should get out of the way, Granddad,
or you'll get hurt and all.

233
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,433
He ain't joking. You should go.

234
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:43,458
Excuse me. Excuse me.

235
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:46,593
If you're looking for another rent boy,
they're on the corner of Smith Street.

236
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:53,784
Manners...

237
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,283
maketh...

238
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:00,616
man.

239
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,349
Do you know what that means?

240
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:13,887
Then let me teach you a lesson.

241
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:26,589
Are we going to stand around here
all day, or are we going to fight?

242
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,546
You fucking dirty, fucking dirty...

243
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:59,094
Sorry about that.
Needed to let off a little steam.

244
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:02,397
I heard yesterday a friend of mine died.

245
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,031
He knew your father, too, actually.

246
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:09,778
Now, I do apologize, Eggsy.

247
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:12,097
I shouldn't have done this
in front of you.

248
00:23:12,197 --> 00:23:15,028
No, please, I won't say nothing. I swear.
If there's one thing I can do,

249
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,587
- it's keep my mouth shut.
- You won't tell a soul?

250
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,392
Ask the Feds.
I've never grassed anyone up.

251
00:23:18,492 --> 00:23:21,247
- Is that a promise?
- On my life!

252
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,822
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

253
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:31,192
You're right about the snobs.
But there, too, there are exceptions.

254
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:34,399
Best of luck with everything.

255
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:52,480
<i>In celebrity news, the Richmond Valentine
movie premiered in Hollywood last night.</i>

256
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,483
<i>The story of the Internet billionaire's
rise to power</i>

257
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,353
<i>is expected to be
this award season's hot ticket.</i>

258
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:01,804
<i>One notable absence
from the red carpet was Iggy Azalea,</i>

259
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:05,260
<i>still missing three days after she failed
to appear at her Oakland concert.</i>

260
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,978
<i>No ransom has been demanded.</i>

261
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,582
Eggsy, just go, please,
because he's gonna...

262
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:11,841
No, please, don't hurt him!

263
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:15,046
Fuck off! Get the fuck away with you!
Shut the fuck up!

264
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:17,266
Who was with you in that fucking pub?

265
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:19,708
I want to know the name
of the geezer you was with!

266
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,643
- I wasn't with no one!
- Who was it?

267
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:23,211
- I don't know what you're on about.
- Who was it?

268
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:25,747
- I don't know who you're fucking on about!
- Fucking tell me his name!

269
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:28,860
I don't know
who you're fucking on about!

270
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,554
<i>You... listen to me!</i>

271
00:24:33,654 --> 00:24:35,691
<i>I want to know who you was with
in that pub. Do you understand?</i>

272
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,630
<i>I want to know his fucking name!</i>

273
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,846
<i>Because, I swear,
I'll rip your head off.</i>

274
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,764
- <i>Tell me!</i>
- <i>I don't know what you're fucking on about!</i>

275
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,065
<i>Tell me!</i>

276
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:47,295
- Just tell him, Eggsy!
- Fuck off! Fuck off, Michelle!

277
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:51,439
I could kill you right now,
and no one in the whole world will notice!

278
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,228
<i>But I would.</i>

279
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,200
I have enough evidence on your activities
to have you locked up

280
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,974
for the rest of your life,
Mr. Dean Anthony Baker.

281
00:24:59,074 --> 00:25:01,285
- What the fuck?!
- <i>So I suggest you leave the boy alone,</i>

282
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:05,219
<i>or I shall be forced to deliver it
to the appropriate authorities.</i>

283
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,846
<i>Eggsy, meet me at the tailor
I told you about.</i>

284
00:25:08,946 --> 00:25:11,960
What the fuck's going on here?

285
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:16,231
Eggsy, you fucking maggot!
Hey, we got a racer!

286
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:17,632
Hey!

287
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:21,422
Eggsy, you fucking... Come here, son!

288
00:25:33,414 --> 00:25:37,216
You wanker! I'll have you, son!

289
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,712
I've never met a tailor before,
but I know you ain't one.

290
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:11,350
Come with me.

291
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,095
Come on in.

292
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,057
What do you see?

293
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:32,239
Someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on.

294
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:36,411
I see a young man with potential.

295
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:39,856
A young man who is loyal,

296
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:41,809
who can do as he's asked,

297
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:45,286
and who wants to do
something good with his life.

298
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,794
Did you see the film Trading Places?

299
00:26:48,894 --> 00:26:50,545
No.

300
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:52,754
How about Nikita?

301
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:55,533
Pretty Woman?

302
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:58,500
All right. My point is,
that the lack of a silver spoon

303
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,970
has set you on a certain path,
but you needn't stay on it.

304
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,264
If you're prepared to adapt and learn,

305
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:07,026
you can transform.

306
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,955
Oh, like in My Fair Lady.

307
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:12,578
Well, you're full of surprises.

308
00:27:12,678 --> 00:27:16,050
Yes, like My Fair Lady.

309
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:19,621
Only, in this case, I'm offering you
the opportunity to become a Kingsman.

310
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:23,358
- A tailor?
- A Kingsman agent.

311
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:27,589
- Like a spy?
- Of sorts.

312
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,154
- Interested?
- You think I've got anything to lose?

313
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:46,347
Since 1849, Kingsman tailors have clothed
the world's most powerful individuals.

314
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:51,719
By 1919, a great number of them
had lost their heirs to World War I.

315
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:55,385
That meant a lot of money
going uninherited,

316
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:59,260
and a lot of powerful men with a desire
to preserve peace and protect life.

317
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,529
Our founders realized that they could
channel that wealth and influence

318
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:04,399
for the greater good.

319
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:08,082
And so began our other venture.

320
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:10,839
An independent, international
intelligence agency

321
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,959
operating at the highest level
of discretion.

322
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,946
Above the politics and bureaucracy
that undermine the integrity

323
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:21,649
of government-run spy organizations.

324
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:24,916
The suit is a modern gentleman's armor,

325
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:27,916
and the Kingsman agents
are the new knights.

326
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:31,824
- How deep does this fucking thing go?
- Deep enough.

327
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:18,804
Shit, we're late.

328
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,097
Your father had the same look
on his face.

329
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:49,235
As did I.

330
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,038
Come on.

331
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:56,277
- Galahad.
- My code name.

332
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,271
Late again, sir.

333
00:29:58,371 --> 00:29:59,932
Good luck.

334
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,047
In you go.

335
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:14,923
Fall in.

336
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:19,133
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Merlin.

337
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,254
You are about to embark

338
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:23,831
on what is probably the most dangerous
job interview in the world.

339
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:29,143
One of you, and only one of you,
will become the next Lancelot.

340
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:32,747
Can anybody tell me what this is?

341
00:30:33,855 --> 00:30:35,250
- Yes?
- Body bag, sir.

342
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,820
- Correct. Charlie, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

343
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,290
Good. In a moment,
you will each collect a body bag.

344
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,259
You will write your name on that bag.

345
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,929
You will write the details
of your next of kin on that bag.

346
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:51,599
This represents your acknowledgment
of the risks that you're about to face

347
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:54,636
as well as your agreement
to strict confidentiality.

348
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:59,608
Which, incidentally, if you break,
will result in you and your next of kin

349
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,569
being in that bag.

350
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:06,915
Is that understood?

351
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:10,282
Excellent. Fall out.

352
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,928
Roxanne. But call me Roxy.

353
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:22,197
- I'm Eggsy.
- "Eggy"?

354
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:26,167
- No, "Eggsy."
- Eggy? And where did they dig you up?

355
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,483
You know we're not allowed to discuss
who proposed us.

356
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:32,821
No need to bite his head off. Charlie's
only making conversation, right, Charlie?

357
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:35,944
- I'm Digby.
- Digby.

358
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:40,078
Eggy, this is Rufus. Rufus, Eggy.

359
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,520
- So, Eggy, are you Oxford or Cambridge?
- Neither.

360
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,055
- Saint Andrews?
- Durham?

361
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,123
No, wait, I think we may have met.

362
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:53,027
Did you serve me at the McDonald's
in Winchester service station?

363
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:56,673
- No.
- It's definitely Saint Andrews.

364
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:59,937
- Just ignore them.
- You need a pen?

365
00:32:00,037 --> 00:32:02,462
- Cheers.
- Amelia, isn't it?

366
00:32:02,562 --> 00:32:05,209
- Amelia, Eggsy.
- Hi, Eggsy.

367
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,128
- Don't take any notice of those guys.
- That's what I told him.

368
00:32:11,338 --> 00:32:14,535
It's just scare tactics.
Classic Army technique.

369
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,074
No one's gonna die.

370
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:22,212
Shame.

371
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:29,078
Great. You don't know, the CIA don't know.
Nobody knows who this guy is?

372
00:32:29,178 --> 00:32:31,719
Fine. Seriously, it's fine.

373
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:35,856
Well, it's not really fine,
but it's not why I'm here.

374
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:39,360
Hell, man, you know me.
Money's not my issue.

375
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,188
I could've retired straight out of MIT,

376
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,864
fucked off to some island,
let the business run itself.

377
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:48,602
Nobody told me to try
and save the planet. I wanted to.

378
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:52,440
Climate change research, lobbying,
years of study, billions of dollars,

379
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,710
and you know why I quit?

380
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:59,880
Because the last time I checked,
the planet was still fucked.

381
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,450
Hence, my epiphany.

382
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,586
Money won't solve this.

383
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:09,823
Those idiots who call themselves politicians
have buried their heads in the sand

384
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:13,026
and stood for nothing but reelection.

385
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:18,032
So I spent the last two years
trying to find a real solution.

386
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:21,068
And I found it.

387
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:24,338
Now, if you really want to make
the world a better place,

388
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:29,022
I suggest you open your fucking ears,
because I'm about to tell it to you.

389
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:33,266
Go on, Mr. Valentine.
I'm still listening.

390
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:37,581
As long as you agree to all my terms.

391
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:22,413
- The fuck is this?
- What's going on?

392
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:25,266
Oh, shit. Jesus!

393
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:26,967
All right, no one panic. Listen to me.

394
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:29,768
- Stay calm.
- Fuck.

395
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,674
Loo snorkels, loo snorkels!

396
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:36,879
- Loo snorkels?
- Showerheads!

397
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:40,332
- Showerheads?!
- She's right. Go! Fucking go!

398
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:43,782
Hey, hang about,
what's wrong with the fucking door?

399
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:10,237
Congratulations on completing
your first task.

400
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:13,107
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

401
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:15,299
For those of you who are still confused,

402
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:17,618
if you can get a breathing tube
around a U-bend of a toilet,

403
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:22,149
you have an unlimited air supply.
Simple physics, worth remembering.

404
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:25,546
Eggsy, well done for spotting
that was a two-way mirror.

405
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:26,821
He's probably seen enough of them.

406
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:29,890
Yeah, you can all wipe
those smirks off your faces.

407
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,794
Because as far as I'm concerned,
every single one of you has failed.

408
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:37,198
You all forgot the most
important thing...

409
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,149
teamwork.

410
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,881
So much for classic Army technique.

411
00:36:59,452 --> 00:37:00,788
Thirty-five.

412
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:03,509
One-oh-five.

413
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:05,824
That's it. That's it.

414
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,969
Hello. Can I help you?

415
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:16,503
Yes. I have a question
about anthropogenic force.

416
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:21,072
Really? Well, it's actually
quite fascinating.

417
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:26,413
My colleague died trying to rescue you,
and I'm sure you saw how well trained he was,

418
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:29,422
so I suggest you tell me who kidnapped you
and why they let you go.

419
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:31,469
I have no idea what you're talking...

420
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:34,435
I'm not supposed to say it,
but it was...

421
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:36,257
Oh, for God's sake,
I've barely touched you.

422
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:38,423
Oh, man up!

423
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:00,502
Fuck that guy, whoever he is.
I'm gonna...

424
00:38:02,126 --> 00:38:05,718
He made me kill Professor Arnold.
I goddamn loved Professor Arnold.

425
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:08,749
The good news is we know the emergency
and surveillance system work.

426
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:10,890
You know what's not good news?

427
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,361
"My colleague died!"
That's what he said!

428
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,831
This is an organization, and they're
all over us. Whoever you spoke to...

429
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:22,803
I told you, I made contact
with the KGB, MI6, Mossad and Beijing.

430
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:26,239
- They all insist he wasn't one of theirs.
- Beijing.

431
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:30,811
So freaky how there's no recognizable
name for the Chinese secret service.

432
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:33,013
Now, that's what you call
a secret, right?

433
00:38:34,113 --> 00:38:35,816
You know what? Fuck it.

434
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:39,453
We need to speed things up.
Bring the product release forward.

435
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:42,923
We're only halfway into production,
and speeding it will cost a fortune.

436
00:38:43,223 --> 00:38:46,525
I look like I give a fuck?
Just get it done.

437
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:52,733
As some of you will have learned
last night,

438
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:56,037
teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.

439
00:38:56,137 --> 00:39:00,240
We're here to enhance your skills,
test you to the limit.

440
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,044
Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

441
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:08,215
Wherever you go, your dog goes.
You will care for it, you will teach it,

442
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:11,618
and by the time it's fully trained,
so will you be.

443
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:14,054
Those of you who are
still here, that is.

444
00:39:14,254 --> 00:39:16,123
Do you understand?

445
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:18,485
Choose your puppy.

446
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:23,063
- A poodle?
- What?

447
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:25,098
They're gun dogs.

448
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:28,533
Oldest working breed. Easy to train.

449
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:31,338
A pug?

450
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:34,664
It's a bulldog, innit?

451
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:39,514
It'll get bigger though, won't it?

452
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:43,709
Shit.

453
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:49,356
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

454
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:52,626
No direct brain trauma at all.

455
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:56,063
- How much longer can he be out?
- That's the million-dollar question.

456
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:58,165
We don't know what he was
exposed to in there.

457
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:01,533
What about Harry's footage?
It didn't stream to his home terminal.

458
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,883
Encrypted and uncrackable.

459
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:07,011
If and when he comes around,
you might want to have a word with him

460
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:10,513
- about sharing his password.
- Is he gonna be all right?

461
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:15,215
We need to have patience, Eggsy.
But there's hope, okay?

462
00:40:15,715 --> 00:40:17,551
If I were you, I'd concentrate
on your training.

463
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:19,784
Make it through the tests.
Make him proud.

464
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:29,162
Fuck! Come on, come on, come on!

465
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:31,554
J.B., come on! Come on!

466
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,753
I'm not coming last 'cause of you.

467
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:39,573
J.B., I'll shoot you!
Goddamn you, I'll fucking shoot you!

468
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:43,985
Merlin said
we're not allowed to hold you.

469
00:40:44,911 --> 00:40:46,177
Bollocks.

470
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:30,482
Water!

471
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:34,528
- Come on, then!
- Eggsy, forget it!

472
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:36,229
Oh, what's wrong, mate?
You can't take a joke?

473
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,599
Seriously, you'll get thrown out,
and it's just not worth it.

474
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,200
Maybe I don't give a fuck
if I get kicked out!

475
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,203
- Do it. Come on, you pleb.
- Charlie, fuck off!

476
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:47,786
Yeah, go on, walk away.

477
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:49,625
Dickhead.

478
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:51,977
Come on, J.B. Come on, good boy.

479
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:09,961
You have exactly one hour
to complete the test, starting now.

480
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:13,767
New target, 800 meters.

481
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:15,636
You know, it's unbelievable.
You're still here,

482
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:19,290
lingering like some big steaming shit
that just won't flush.

483
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:23,143
Roger that. Target identified.
And how about you shut the fuck up?

484
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:26,073
Positive discrimination,
that's what it is.

485
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:29,487
It's like those fucking state school kids
who get into Oxford on "C" grades

486
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:32,836
- 'cause their mum is a one-legged lesbian.
- You don't know fuck all about my grades.

487
00:42:32,936 --> 00:42:36,364
Oh, forgive me, I'm sure you're highly
educated. Fire when ready.

488
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:40,492
How's that for positive discrimination?

489
00:42:53,373 --> 00:42:54,978
I want to thank you both for listening,

490
00:42:55,078 --> 00:42:59,479
and I really, really appreciate you
traveling all this way, Your Royal Highness.

491
00:42:59,779 --> 00:43:01,448
And you, too, Prime Minister.

492
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:04,551
I think this is quite brilliant.

493
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:07,966
It's absolutely brilliant.

494
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:12,969
You are completely crazy.

495
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,770
And as for you, Prime Minister

496
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,087
I'm speechless you'd even consider this.

497
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:25,455
- Don't touch...
- Sorry, Your Royal Highness.

498
00:43:25,555 --> 00:43:29,276
But you've got a big role to play in getting
the Scandinavian region back on track.

499
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:33,580
You're popular, inspirational, and you have
the power to galvanize the people.

500
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,783
Now, whether you're on board or not,

501
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:41,388
I'm going to have to insist on getting you
somewhere I can ensure your safety.

502
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:44,124
How about you, Prime Minister?
You in or out?

503
00:43:45,217 --> 00:43:49,863
Well, I think it's about time
that a politician did something that...

504
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:52,007
actually made a difference.

505
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:53,734
Too true.

506
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:56,895
- What...?
- Take her away.

507
00:44:00,006 --> 00:44:03,341
- Drink?
- Why not?

508
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,168
Guards! Help!

509
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,650
Don't worry. No harm
will come to the princess.

510
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:14,219
Well, I'm a republican anyway,
so it... it really doesn't matter.

511
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,220
Release the princess!

512
00:44:50,657 --> 00:44:53,977
Okay, you're done. Not so bad, right?

513
00:44:54,077 --> 00:44:55,929
Hardly felt a thing.

514
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,998
Welcome aboard.

515
00:44:58,098 --> 00:45:00,331
Pleasure is all mine.

516
00:45:06,341 --> 00:45:08,313
Ever heard of knocking?

517
00:45:08,413 --> 00:45:11,189
Only when I'm casing a place to rob.

518
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:13,499
Merlin said you wanted to see me.

519
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:15,976
I hope J.B.'s training is going
as well as yours is.

520
00:45:16,076 --> 00:45:17,944
Sit.

521
00:45:19,046 --> 00:45:22,609
Congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates.

522
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:25,089
Your test results were even better
than I could've hoped.

523
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,681
Come in.

524
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:36,870
Eggsy, I need to have a private
conversation. You're dismissed.

525
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:41,041
Nonsense. Let him observe.
Might learn a thing or two.

526
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:43,344
As you wish. Take a look at this.

527
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:46,046
<i>Oh, for God's sake, I've barely
touched you. Oh, man up!</i>

528
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:51,184
Fucking hell! That is rank, Harry.

529
00:45:51,284 --> 00:45:54,487
You blew up his head?
It's a bit much, innit?

530
00:45:54,587 --> 00:45:58,024
Actually, the explosion was caused
by an implant in his neck.

531
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:00,126
Here, under the scar.

532
00:46:00,226 --> 00:46:02,579
Did my hardware pick up
the signal that triggered it?

533
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,631
Fortunately, yes.

534
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:08,968
Unfortunately, the IP address I traced it to
is registered to the Valentine Corporation.

535
00:46:09,068 --> 00:46:12,038
That's not much of a lead.
He has millions of employees worldwide.

536
00:46:12,138 --> 00:46:14,172
That Richmond Valentine is a genius.

537
00:46:17,977 --> 00:46:20,881
Did you not see his announcement today?

538
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:22,810
No.

539
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:31,658
<i>We each spend on average $2,000 a year
on cell phone and Internet usage.</i>

540
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:35,095
It gives me great pleasure to announce

541
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:37,530
those days are over.

542
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:42,986
As of tomorrow, every man, woman
and child can claim a free SIM card,

543
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:46,774
compatible with any cell phone,
any computer,

544
00:46:46,897 --> 00:46:51,561
<i>and utilize my communications
network for free.</i>

545
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:57,049
Free calls, free Internet for everyone.

546
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:59,403
Forever.

547
00:47:14,534 --> 00:47:17,103
Valentine's assistant
has the same implant scar.

548
00:47:17,703 --> 00:47:20,338
I think Mr. Valentine and I
should have a tête-à-tête.

549
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,489
He's having a gala dinner next week.

550
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:29,282
I'll get you an invitation.
You need to be careful, though.

551
00:47:29,382 --> 00:47:31,551
Since you've been out,
hundreds of VIPs have gone missing.

552
00:47:31,651 --> 00:47:34,020
No ransom notes,
exactly like Professor Arnold.

553
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,288
Then I suggest you make my alias
somebody worth kidnapping.

554
00:47:49,802 --> 00:47:52,272
Fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

555
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:54,507
- What, don't like heights?
- Yeah, it's okay.

556
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:58,276
I've done it before, which is...
probably why, come to think of it.

557
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:03,114
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
You're top of the class.

558
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:09,419
<i>Listen up. Your mission is to land in the
target withou the radar detecting you.</i>

559
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,598
If I read you on the radar
or you miss the target, you go home.

560
00:48:13,698 --> 00:48:15,719
Is that understood?

561
00:48:18,348 --> 00:48:20,765
<i>Drop zone coming up, 20 seconds.</i>

562
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:23,601
We got to go.

563
00:48:32,912 --> 00:48:34,881
Eggsy, I really don't
think I can do this.

564
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:38,812
Of course you can't. Head to the back
and I'll show you how, yeah?

565
00:48:44,384 --> 00:48:45,859
Come on!

566
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:49,004
Eggsy! Eggsy, wait! Hang on!

567
00:48:49,104 --> 00:48:51,958
Roxy, just stop fucking about!

568
00:48:52,165 --> 00:48:53,896
Follow me, yeah?

569
00:49:07,113 --> 00:49:09,461
Come on!

570
00:49:10,316 --> 00:49:12,248
<i>Roxy, it's now or never.</i>

571
00:49:13,627 --> 00:49:15,605
<i>Jump!</i>

572
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:36,443
Good girl, Rox, I'm glad you made it!

573
00:49:43,883 --> 00:49:45,716
Yeah!

574
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:50,991
Yeah!

575
00:49:51,691 --> 00:49:52,557
Come on!

576
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:57,382
My, my, you're all very cheerful.

577
00:49:57,482 --> 00:49:59,699
Did you really think it was
gonna be that straightforward?

578
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:02,135
Any idiot can read a heads-up display.

579
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:06,439
A Kingsman agent needs to be able
to solve problems under pressure.

580
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:09,941
Like what to do when one
of your group has no parachute.

581
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,013
- What? No parachute?!
- Shit!

582
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:15,515
- Who?!
- Fuck!

583
00:50:15,915 --> 00:50:18,318
- Which one?
- What do we do?!

584
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:21,337
<i>I told you. Aim for the target.
Come in under the radar.</i>

585
00:50:21,437 --> 00:50:23,389
And I hope not to be
scraping one of you up.

586
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:27,290
But if I do have to,
and you're inside the target,

587
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,029
please know I'll be very impressed.

588
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:30,912
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit!

589
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:36,715
Everybody listen, I've got a plan!

590
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,638
Pair off!
Grab the closest person to them.

591
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:45,612
- Rufus, come on!
- Oh, fuck!

592
00:50:46,723 --> 00:50:49,655
- Rufus!
- Oh, shit! I can't!

593
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,612
Fuck!

594
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:56,139
Oh, thank God.

595
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:57,989
<i>Rufus, you wanker!</i>

596
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:01,469
Shit, we're an odd number now!

597
00:51:01,569 --> 00:51:05,429
- Quick, make a circle!
- Fuck, he's right! Boys, let's do it.

598
00:51:09,535 --> 00:51:11,504
We pull our cords one by one!

599
00:51:11,704 --> 00:51:15,273
When we know who's fucked,
the person on their right grabs them.

600
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:17,877
Okay, Eggsy.

601
00:51:17,977 --> 00:51:21,214
Good plan, Eggsy. You have 30 seconds.
Come on now, hurry.

602
00:51:21,314 --> 00:51:22,413
Me first!

603
00:51:24,517 --> 00:51:27,251
Oh, fuck! Yes!

604
00:51:29,322 --> 00:51:31,656
Okay, me next.

605
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:35,293
See you on the ground, boys.

606
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:41,107
Now me.

607
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,685
Fuck!

608
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:52,797
Roxy, no matter what happens now,
I've got you, all right?

609
00:51:56,011 --> 00:51:57,198
Okay, Eggsy.

610
00:51:57,298 --> 00:51:59,695
- Yours first, okay?
- Yep.

611
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:12,597
Oh, shit!

612
00:52:20,373 --> 00:52:21,605
Shit!

613
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:25,198
Shit!

614
00:52:26,498 --> 00:52:28,079
Rox!

615
00:52:30,883 --> 00:52:32,016
Fuck.

616
00:52:48,434 --> 00:52:50,803
Hugo, Digby.

617
00:52:50,903 --> 00:52:53,773
You don't land in the K,
you're not in the K.

618
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:57,644
Rufus, you opened too soon.
You were all over the radar.

619
00:52:57,744 --> 00:52:59,543
All three of you,
pack your bags, go home.

620
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:05,885
Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations.
You set a new record.

621
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:10,459
Opening at 300 feet, that's pretty ballsy.
Well done for completing another task.

622
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,163
Fall out.

623
00:53:12,263 --> 00:53:15,128
Sorry, sir. But why the fuck
did you choose me as the gimp?

624
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:19,226
- Am I the expendable candidate?
- No, no, no. You don't talk to me like that.

625
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:23,165
You have a complaint, you come here
and you whisper it in my ear.

626
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:31,539
You need to take that chip
off your shoulder.

627
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:04,610
Mr. DeVere. It's a pleasure to meet you.

628
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,847
I'm awfully sorry.
I seem to have my dates muddled up.

629
00:54:07,947 --> 00:54:10,983
Oh, no, no, no.
I canceled the gala because of you.

630
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:14,948
Anybody willing to donate that much
deserves their own dinner.

631
00:54:15,048 --> 00:54:16,862
Come in.

632
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:17,987
Thank you.

633
00:54:19,892 --> 00:54:22,643
Gotta admit, I was
really intrigued to meet you.

634
00:54:22,743 --> 00:54:24,379
There aren't many billionaires
I don't know.

635
00:54:24,479 --> 00:54:25,532
I don't doubt it.

636
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:28,968
And, obviously, I had my people
look into your affairs,

637
00:54:29,068 --> 00:54:31,984
and that's some pretty old money
you're from. How'd your folks make it?

638
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:35,405
Property, mostly.
Property and the markets.

639
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:37,543
Nothing questionable,
if that's your concern.

640
00:54:37,643 --> 00:54:40,729
Look, I'm just into finding out
what caliber person you are.

641
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:43,115
- I'm sure you understand that.
- I most certainly do.

642
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:44,911
- Hope you're hungry.
- I'm famished.

643
00:54:45,011 --> 00:54:47,751
Good. Grab a seat.

644
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,310
- I'll have the Big Mac, please.
- Great choice!

645
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:14,817
But nothing beats two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce.

646
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:17,863
- Goes great with this '45 Lafite.
- A classic pairing.

647
00:55:18,163 --> 00:55:22,109
And may I suggest Twinkies and a 1937
Château d'Yquem for pudding?

648
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:24,717
I like it. So...

649
00:55:24,817 --> 00:55:27,993
you want to donate to my foundation.

650
00:55:28,093 --> 00:55:31,544
You are aware that I wound things down
in that area, right?

651
00:55:31,644 --> 00:55:34,633
Climate change is a threat
which affects us all, Mr. Valentine.

652
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:37,820
And you're one of the few powerful men
who seems to share my concerns.

653
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,739
No, I shut things down
because I wasn't getting anywhere.

654
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:43,693
Every bit of research kept pointing
to the same thing.

655
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:46,863
That carbon emissions are a red herring
and that we're past the point of no return,

656
00:55:46,963 --> 00:55:50,900
- no matter what remedial actions we take.
- Oh, you know your shit.

657
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,839
I sometimes envy the blissful ignorance
of those less well-versed in the... shit.

658
00:55:57,532 --> 00:55:59,575
As Professor Arnold always said,

659
00:55:59,675 --> 00:56:02,185
"Humankind is the only virus
cursed to live

660
00:56:02,285 --> 00:56:05,485
with the horrifying knowledge
of its host's fragile mortality."

661
00:56:06,854 --> 00:56:09,250
You know, not a lot of people
knew about him.

662
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:14,322
You like spy movies, Mr. DeVere?

663
00:56:18,063 --> 00:56:21,347
Nowadays they're all a little
serious for my taste.

664
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:24,233
But the old ones... marvelous.

665
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:26,869
Give me a far-fetched
theatrical plot any day.

666
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:30,072
The old Bond movies! Oh, man!

667
00:56:30,172 --> 00:56:34,792
Oh, when I was a kid,
that was my dream job:

668
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,927
gentleman spy.

669
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:40,149
I always felt the old Bond films
were only as good as the villain.

670
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:44,685
As a child, I rather fancied a future
as a colorful megalomaniac.

671
00:56:46,588 --> 00:56:49,823
What a shame we both had to grow up.

672
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:55,606
Bon appétit.

673
00:56:58,292 --> 00:57:01,380
Just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal.

674
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,887
I'll have my people get in touch
with yours, and it's all good.

675
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:09,202
And thank you for such a... happy meal.

676
00:57:13,715 --> 00:57:16,627
- Well, want me to follow him?
- Nah.

677
00:57:16,727 --> 00:57:19,339
I put a nano tracker gel in the wine.

678
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:22,458
We'll know his every move
for the next 24 hours.

679
00:57:22,558 --> 00:57:25,161
Finally find out who he works for.

680
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:28,809
Valentine didn't let me
out of his sight.

681
00:57:28,909 --> 00:57:32,185
All I got was this on the way in.

682
00:57:35,504 --> 00:57:39,288
South Glade Mission Church
is a hate group based in Kentucky.

683
00:57:39,388 --> 00:57:42,859
- FBI have been monitoring them for years.
- But you think Valentine is a supporter?

684
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,416
No evidence yet of a direct connection,
but I'll keep looking.

685
00:57:47,216 --> 00:57:48,481
Oh, by the way,

686
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:54,256
our ever-growing list of missing persons
now includes Scandinavian royalty.

687
00:57:54,356 --> 00:57:57,201
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.

688
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:01,890
Just let me out, you psycho!

689
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,999
I told you, you're free to go
any time you want,

690
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:07,445
as long as you agree to my conditions.

691
00:58:07,545 --> 00:58:12,141
I don't agree, and I am never,
ever going to agree!

692
00:58:12,341 --> 00:58:13,576
Tough shit.

693
00:58:14,132 --> 00:58:15,978
Bitch.

694
00:58:16,979 --> 00:58:19,515
I want to speak to the British consul!

695
00:58:19,615 --> 00:58:21,908
<i>The list of missing celebrities
and dignitaries</i>

696
00:58:22,008 --> 00:58:23,786
<i>has continued to grow in recent weeks,</i>

697
00:58:23,886 --> 00:58:28,024
<i>and world leaders are coming under
increasing pressure to provide answers.</i>

698
00:58:28,124 --> 00:58:31,994
We are doing everything in our power
to find Princess Tilde.

699
00:58:32,094 --> 00:58:35,431
You know, governments
and security forces worldwide

700
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:39,085
are working together to find the person
behind these abductions.

701
00:58:39,235 --> 00:58:42,663
<i>In other news, people all over the world
continue to wait in line</i>

702
00:58:42,763 --> 00:58:45,707
<i>day and night
to get their free SIM cards.</i>

703
00:58:45,807 --> 00:58:48,104
Mrs. P. You get one?

704
00:58:48,444 --> 00:58:50,997
Yeah. Yeah, I been queuing up all day.

705
00:58:51,097 --> 00:58:55,419
<i>This unprecedented giveaway
by the philanthropist Richmond Valentine</i>

706
00:58:55,649 --> 00:58:58,575
<i>has already seen
over a billion cards distributed.</i>

707
00:58:58,675 --> 00:58:59,620
At ease.

708
00:59:01,857 --> 00:59:04,160
So you thought we were done for the day?

709
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,096
Well, we're not.

710
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:11,250
- A party?
- Tonight, in London.

711
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:13,229
- Who's this?
- Your target.

712
00:59:13,329 --> 00:59:16,261
Your mission is to use your NLP training

713
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:18,808
to win over the individual
in the photograph in your envelope.

714
00:59:18,908 --> 00:59:22,378
And when I say "win over,"
I do mean in the biblical sense.

715
00:59:22,478 --> 00:59:23,579
Easy.

716
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:26,723
Posh girls love a bit of rough.

717
00:59:26,823 --> 00:59:28,706
We'll see about that, yeah?

718
00:59:28,806 --> 00:59:31,110
We certainly will.

719
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:40,306
Hi. Sorry, I just had to come over
and say, amazing eyes.

720
00:59:40,406 --> 00:59:42,899
- Are you wearing color contacts?
- No!

721
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:45,584
- You so are.
- Oh, my God, negging!

722
00:59:45,684 --> 00:59:48,804
That's hilarious. I haven't heard anyone
try that since the noughties.

723
00:59:48,904 --> 00:59:51,097
- Excuse me?
- Negging.

724
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:55,054
Saying something negative to a pretty girl
in order to undermine her social value.

725
00:59:55,444 --> 00:59:57,825
It's supposed to make you
want to win his approval.

726
00:59:57,925 --> 01:00:00,967
Absurdly basic, neuro-linguistic
programming technique.

727
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:03,192
Is it just me, or does this champagne
taste a little bit funny?

728
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:05,325
- It's an acquired taste, mate.
- I think it's just cheap.

729
01:00:05,425 --> 01:00:07,256
Get one of these instead.
They're delicious.

730
01:00:07,356 --> 01:00:10,311
You know, if you're into
seduction techniques, this guy is textbook.

731
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:12,561
See what he just did?
It's called an opinion opener.

732
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:14,505
He got you talking
with a neutral question,

733
01:00:14,605 --> 01:00:18,566
got all of us involved in the conversation,
so that you craved individual attention.

734
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,370
No, I'm just saying
the champagne tastes rank.

735
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,030
Lady Sophie Montague-Herring,
phone call for you at reception.

736
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,763
- Be right back.
- We'll see you in a bit, yeah?

737
01:00:25,963 --> 01:00:27,359
See you in a bit.

738
01:00:27,459 --> 01:00:29,478
Budge up, Rox. I'm feeling a bit rough.

739
01:00:29,578 --> 01:00:31,046
- Are you all right?
- No.

740
01:00:31,146 --> 01:00:32,256
Sorry to eavesdrop, but, you know,

741
01:00:32,356 --> 01:00:35,885
there's a much easier way to guarantee
getting someone home.

742
01:00:36,185 --> 01:00:38,320
Rohypnol.

743
01:00:39,925 --> 01:00:42,992
Or even something stronger.

744
01:00:59,074 --> 01:01:00,810
Who the fuck are you?

745
01:01:01,448 --> 01:01:03,510
Where am I?

746
01:01:05,346 --> 01:01:08,582
This knife... can save your life.

747
01:01:13,018 --> 01:01:14,210
Fuck!

748
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:17,126
My employer's got
two questions for you, Eggsy:

749
01:01:17,226 --> 01:01:21,096
What the fuck is Kingsman,
and who's Harry Hart?

750
01:01:21,196 --> 01:01:24,085
I don't know who the fuck that is! Shit!

751
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:28,505
Eggsy, I just killed two of your friends
for giving me the same bullshit answer!

752
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:32,274
Fuck! Just cut
the fucking ropes, please!

753
01:01:32,374 --> 01:01:35,044
Hey, Eggsy! Is Kingsman worth dying for?

754
01:01:35,644 --> 01:01:36,679
F...

755
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:38,612
Fuck you!

756
01:01:53,056 --> 01:01:55,629
Congratulations. Bloody well done.

757
01:01:57,999 --> 01:01:59,817
How'd the others do?

758
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:04,271
Roxy passed with flying colors.
Charlie's up next. Want to watch?

759
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:07,740
Yeah, all right.

760
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:09,679
Oh, fuck.

761
01:02:09,779 --> 01:02:11,747
Is Kingsman really worth dying for?

762
01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:15,417
No, it fucking isn't! Shit,
I'll tell you what you want. Please!

763
01:02:15,517 --> 01:02:16,937
Chester King is Arthur.

764
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:19,635
Arthur's head of a spy agency...
it's called Kingsman. Get me out of here!

765
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:22,488
Thank you, Charlie. Much appreciated.

766
01:02:22,588 --> 01:02:25,213
Come on! That wasn't the fucking deal!

767
01:02:25,313 --> 01:02:27,168
Fuck!

768
01:02:27,268 --> 01:02:28,662
Oh, fuck!

769
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:39,225
I had such high hopes for you.
You're a bloody disgrace.

770
01:02:39,325 --> 01:02:42,228
Arthur, I'm sorry. At least untie me.

771
01:02:42,678 --> 01:02:43,944
Untie yourself.

772
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:47,717
Arthur... Arthur, please.

773
01:02:49,088 --> 01:02:51,887
<i>I'm the fucking son of the... shit!</i>

774
01:02:51,987 --> 01:02:54,473
<i>Anyone? Hello?</i>

775
01:02:54,573 --> 01:02:57,026
Galahad, Percival, congratulations.

776
01:02:57,326 --> 01:03:00,262
Your candidates have reached
the final stage of the testing process.

777
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:04,554
As tradition allows, you now have
24 hours to spend with them.

778
01:03:04,654 --> 01:03:08,351
Eggsy... you should know
your father reached this point.

779
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,511
From now on, there are no
safety nets, understood?

780
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,744
Good. Dismissed.

781
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:22,284
Charlie, time to go home.

782
01:03:22,384 --> 01:03:24,320
Fuck you!

783
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,470
Fucking Dad's gonna hear about this!

784
01:03:28,716 --> 01:03:30,693
"To pee or not to pee?"

785
01:03:30,793 --> 01:03:35,601
That was the headline the day after
I defused a dirty bomb in Paris.

786
01:03:36,036 --> 01:03:39,099
- "Germany - 1, England - 5."
- Missed that game.

787
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,569
I was breaking up an undercover
spy ring at the Pentagon.

788
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:51,947
My first mission. Foiled the assassination
of Margaret Thatcher.

789
01:03:52,047 --> 01:03:53,682
Not everybody'd thank you for that one.

790
01:03:53,782 --> 01:03:57,130
The point is, Eggsy,
nobody thanked me for any of them.

791
01:03:57,230 --> 01:04:00,946
Front page news on all these occasions
was celebrity nonsense.

792
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:04,883
Because it's the nature of Kingsman
that our achievements remain secret.

793
01:04:04,983 --> 01:04:08,440
A gentleman's name should
appear in the newspaper only three times:

794
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,961
when he's born, when he marries,
and when he dies.

795
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:14,136
And we are,
first and foremost, gentlemen.

796
01:04:14,515 --> 01:04:16,782
That's me fucked, then.

797
01:04:16,882 --> 01:04:18,845
Well, it's like Charlie said...
I'm just a pleb.

798
01:04:18,945 --> 01:04:22,478
Nonsense. Being a gentleman has nothing
to do with the circumstances of one's birth.

799
01:04:23,587 --> 01:04:25,983
Being a gentleman
is something one learns.

800
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,914
Yeah, but how?

801
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:33,572
All right, first lesson. You should have
asked me before you took a seat.

802
01:04:33,672 --> 01:04:37,057
Second lesson.
How to make a proper martini.

803
01:04:38,027 --> 01:04:40,060
Yes, Harry.

804
01:04:42,764 --> 01:04:46,296
Goddamn it! This fucking hurts!

805
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:48,737
You're the one who asked
for a biometric security system.

806
01:04:48,837 --> 01:04:51,203
- What's wrong with a simple switch?
- A simple switch?!

807
01:04:51,303 --> 01:04:55,248
This is an extremely dangerous machine.

808
01:04:55,348 --> 01:05:00,081
It should only be operated by someone
as responsible and sane as me.

809
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:03,785
Bad shit can happen if this falls
into the wrong hands.

810
01:05:04,262 --> 01:05:07,189
Whoa! We done here? Shit!

811
01:05:07,289 --> 01:05:11,160
No. Now this one.
For the test at the church.

812
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:14,828
This one just has a short range.
A simple switch will do.

813
01:05:20,902 --> 01:05:23,876
So are you gonna teach me
how to talk proper, like in My Fair Lady?

814
01:05:23,976 --> 01:05:28,113
Don't be absurd. Being a gentleman
has nothing to do with one's accent.

815
01:05:28,213 --> 01:05:30,712
It's about being at ease
in one's own skin.

816
01:05:30,812 --> 01:05:35,302
As Hemingway said, "There is nothing noble
in being superior to your fellow man.

817
01:05:35,402 --> 01:05:39,185
True nobility is being superior
to your former self."

818
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:45,894
Now... first thing every gentleman
needs is a good suit.

819
01:05:46,094 --> 01:05:49,231
By which I mean, a bespoke suit.
Never off the peg.

820
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:52,027
And Kingsman suits
are always bulletproof.

821
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,696
So let's get you measured, and then,
whether you get the job or not,

822
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:59,408
you'll have a lasting and... useful
memento of your time at Kingsman.

823
01:05:59,508 --> 01:06:03,312
I'm so sorry, sir, but a gentleman
is completing his fitting.

824
01:06:03,412 --> 01:06:05,581
Fitting room two is available.

825
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:10,585
One does not use fitting room two
when one is popping one's cherry.

826
01:06:10,904 --> 01:06:15,293
Perhaps I'll show you
fitting room three while we wait.

827
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:27,202
- So we going up or down?
- Neither.

828
01:06:27,891 --> 01:06:28,895
This it?

829
01:06:28,995 --> 01:06:31,899
Of course not.
Pull the hook on your left.

830
01:06:39,407 --> 01:06:42,616
Oh, yes. Very, very nice.

831
01:06:45,787 --> 01:06:48,457
Now, you're going to need a pair
of shoes to go with your suit.

832
01:06:48,557 --> 01:06:52,528
An Oxford is any formal shoe
with open lacing.

833
01:06:52,628 --> 01:06:55,864
This additional decorative piece
is called broguing.

834
01:06:56,064 --> 01:06:58,934
- "Oxfords, not brogues."
- Words to live by, Eggsy.

835
01:06:59,312 --> 01:07:01,837
Words to live by. Try a pair.

836
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:05,241
Your weapon scores are excellent,
by the way.

837
01:07:05,341 --> 01:07:08,744
These you're familiar with.
And this is our standard-issue pistol.

838
01:07:08,944 --> 01:07:11,814
It's quite unique. As you'll see,
it also fires a shotgun cartridge

839
01:07:11,914 --> 01:07:14,116
for use in messy close-range situations.

840
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:15,818
- How do they feel?
- Yeah, good.

841
01:07:15,918 --> 01:07:20,493
Now do your very best impersonation
of a German aristocrat's formal greeting.

842
01:07:22,743 --> 01:07:24,834
No, Eggsy.

843
01:07:27,863 --> 01:07:29,090
That is sick.

844
01:07:30,165 --> 01:07:32,289
In the old days, they had a phone
in the heel, as well.

845
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:33,426
How do I get it back in?

846
01:07:33,526 --> 01:07:35,898
Well, it's coated in one
of the fastest-acting neurotoxins

847
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:39,072
known to man, so... very carefully.

848
01:07:41,076 --> 01:07:42,293
Now...

849
01:07:42,393 --> 01:07:44,860
I've had a lot of fun with this.

850
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,094
One of our finest examples
of chemical engineering.

851
01:07:48,194 --> 01:07:50,399
A poison... harmless when ingested,

852
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:53,988
but at a time convenient to you,
can be...

853
01:07:54,088 --> 01:07:56,723
remotely activated. Primed.

854
01:07:58,537 --> 01:08:00,197
Lethal.

855
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:02,524
And what about these? What do these do?

856
01:08:03,124 --> 01:08:04,917
- Electrocute you?
- Don't be ridiculous.

857
01:08:05,017 --> 01:08:06,702
- It's a hand grenade.
- Shut up.

858
01:08:06,802 --> 01:08:09,138
You want to electrocute someone,
you'll need a signet ring.

859
01:08:09,238 --> 01:08:11,540
A gentleman traditionally wears
the signet on his left hand,

860
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,793
but a Kingsman wears it on whichever hand
happens to be dominant.

861
01:08:14,893 --> 01:08:17,510
Touch the contact behind the ring,
it delivers 50,000 volts.

862
01:08:19,181 --> 01:08:22,089
And what about them?
What makes them so special?

863
01:08:22,189 --> 01:08:25,954
Nothing. That technology's
caught up with the spy world.

864
01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:29,089
Put it back, Eggsy.

865
01:08:31,848 --> 01:08:35,162
Perfect timing.
Gentleman's just finished.

866
01:08:39,887 --> 01:08:42,500
Mr. DeVere!

867
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,906
What a coincidence!

868
01:08:45,006 --> 01:08:47,776
You are totally the reason I am here.

869
01:08:48,076 --> 01:08:53,015
When you left my house, I was thirsting for
that dope-ass smoking jacket you had on,

870
01:08:53,115 --> 01:08:54,783
and since I'm going to Royal Ascot,

871
01:08:54,883 --> 01:08:56,970
and apparently you need one
of these penguin suits...

872
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,255
here I am. What are you doing here?

873
01:09:00,555 --> 01:09:03,058
What's up, man? Richmond Valentine.

874
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:06,428
This is my new valet.
I was just introducing him to my tailor.

875
01:09:06,528 --> 01:09:09,534
Another coincidence. So am I.

876
01:09:09,964 --> 01:09:12,090
Have you had any chance
to think further on my proposal?

877
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:16,496
Most definitely. My people will be
getting in touch with you very soon.

878
01:09:16,596 --> 01:09:18,722
I guarantee it.

879
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:19,975
A word of advice:

880
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:22,678
Ascot requires top hat.

881
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:26,715
I might suggest Lock & Co. Hatters.

882
01:09:27,612 --> 01:09:30,218
- St. James's.
- "Lox," as in smoked fish?

883
01:09:30,318 --> 01:09:32,736
As in "locked up."

884
01:09:35,957 --> 01:09:39,421
I have trouble understanding
you people sometimes.

885
01:09:39,521 --> 01:09:41,361
You all talk so funny.

886
01:09:48,482 --> 01:09:51,540
Gentlemen, would you look
after him, please?

887
01:10:04,252 --> 01:10:08,121
Now, this... is a dope-ass top hat.

888
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:12,797
Gazelle! Let's go ascoting.

889
01:10:13,879 --> 01:10:18,733
<i>Your hat looks fine, Gazelle. Come on,
don't make me late for the queen.</i>

890
01:10:19,065 --> 01:10:21,736
<i>Come on, Gazelle, we're gonna be late.</i>

891
01:10:21,836 --> 01:10:24,838
<i>How far is Ascot? How far?</i>

892
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:32,212
- Merlin said you wanted to see me, sir?
- Sit down.

893
01:10:37,418 --> 01:10:38,589
Pretty dog.

894
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,523
- What's his name?
- J.B.

895
01:10:41,623 --> 01:10:43,925
- As in James Bond?
- No.

896
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:47,763
- Jason Bourne?
- No. Jack Bauer.

897
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:51,499
Bravo.

898
01:10:51,599 --> 01:10:53,095
It pains me to admit it, Eggsy,

899
01:10:53,195 --> 01:10:57,904
but I think that one day you might
be as good a spy as any of them.

900
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,497
Take it.

901
01:11:12,985 --> 01:11:14,120
Shoot the dog.

902
01:11:21,029 --> 01:11:23,558
This weapon is live.

903
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:28,110
Shoot the dog.

904
01:12:05,211 --> 01:12:07,589
Give me the gun.

905
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:20,537
At least the girl's got balls.

906
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,459
Get out. I knew you couldn't make it.

907
01:12:29,831 --> 01:12:31,877
Go home.

908
01:12:32,877 --> 01:12:35,402
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

909
01:12:59,342 --> 01:13:03,363
Welcome... to Kingsman...

910
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:05,348
Lancelot.

911
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:30,225
- Mom?
- Eggsy!

912
01:13:30,425 --> 01:13:34,360
Oh, God, where have you been?
I've been so worried about you.

913
01:13:35,864 --> 01:13:39,103
Oh, my days, look how big you've grown.

914
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,741
Where is he?

915
01:13:45,841 --> 01:13:48,655
I'm fine. Eggsy, please, please,
just don't get involved.

916
01:13:48,755 --> 01:13:50,812
Ma, I should never
have left you on your own.

917
01:13:50,912 --> 01:13:53,341
This stops right now.

918
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:56,091
- I'll be right back.
- Eggsy...

919
01:13:58,715 --> 01:13:59,888
Oi! Dean!

920
01:14:00,788 --> 01:14:02,757
Oh, Mugsy. So you're back.

921
01:14:02,857 --> 01:14:04,823
What, you gone and nicked
a fucking taxi now?

922
01:14:04,923 --> 01:14:08,829
Yeah. Can I have a word
about my mum's black eye?

923
01:14:09,787 --> 01:14:11,513
You want to have a word with me?
You get out of that cab,

924
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:14,623
I'll knock you straight
back down on your fucking arse.

925
01:14:15,436 --> 01:14:18,499
Tell your muppets to go inside,
then I'll get out.

926
01:14:19,799 --> 01:14:21,743
Go on, lads. There'll be two hits:

927
01:14:21,843 --> 01:14:23,812
me hitting him; him hitting the floor.

928
01:14:24,312 --> 01:14:27,652
Come on, then, you prick,
let's see what you got.

929
01:14:27,752 --> 01:14:29,463
Want a bit of me? What are you doing?

930
01:14:29,563 --> 01:14:31,853
- What the fuck? No, no! Come on!
- Get out of the fucking car!

931
01:14:31,953 --> 01:14:33,788
What are you doing?
What are you doing, you mug!

932
01:14:33,888 --> 01:14:35,156
Go on! You got no bollocks!

933
01:14:36,003 --> 01:14:37,959
Come on, bruv, he hit my fucking mum!

934
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:40,460
Come back when you've grown
a pair! Mugsy!

935
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,721
You throw away your biggest opportunity

936
01:15:06,821 --> 01:15:09,197
over a fucking dog.

937
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:11,860
And then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss's car.

938
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,229
You shot a dog
just to get a fucking job.

939
01:15:14,329 --> 01:15:16,413
Yes, I did.

940
01:15:18,825 --> 01:15:22,535
And Mr. Pickle here reminds me of that
every time I take a shit.

941
01:15:24,172 --> 01:15:28,176
You shot your dog and had it stuffed?
You fucking freak.

942
01:15:28,276 --> 01:15:31,504
No, I shot my dog, and then I brought him
home and continued to care for him

943
01:15:31,604 --> 01:15:34,705
for the next 11 years
until he died of pancreatitis.

944
01:15:34,805 --> 01:15:38,219
- What?!
- It was a blank, Eggsy.

945
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:40,889
It was a fucking blank.

946
01:15:40,989 --> 01:15:43,191
- Remember Amelia?
- Yeah.

947
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:44,496
She didn't drown.

948
01:15:44,596 --> 01:15:48,921
She works in our tech department in Berlin;
she's fine. Limits must be tested.

949
01:15:49,021 --> 01:15:51,666
A Kingsman only condones the risking
of a life to save another.

950
01:15:51,766 --> 01:15:54,969
Like my dad saved your life
even though your fuck-up cost his.

951
01:15:55,069 --> 01:15:56,586
Or have you got him
stuffed here and all?

952
01:15:58,778 --> 01:16:01,724
Can't you see that everything I've done
has been about trying to repay him?

953
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:11,019
Harry, listen to this. Valentine's
at last saying something of note.

954
01:16:11,581 --> 01:16:13,822
<i>Know what I love about pen and paper?</i>

955
01:16:14,272 --> 01:16:16,691
Nobody can hack into this shit.

956
01:16:17,191 --> 01:16:20,661
Our worldwide tour
was a complete success.

957
01:16:20,761 --> 01:16:23,298
We... have total coverall.

958
01:16:23,398 --> 01:16:26,479
Like when all your numbers
in bingo are crossed out.

959
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:29,739
- Bingo?
- Bingo. The game.

960
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:33,351
- You have played bingo, right?
- Do I look like I play bingo?

961
01:16:35,743 --> 01:16:37,306
Point is...

962
01:16:37,406 --> 01:16:39,714
if our tests go well
at the church tomorrow,

963
01:16:39,814 --> 01:16:41,916
<i>we are good to go.</i>

964
01:16:42,016 --> 01:16:44,886
South Glade Mission Church.

965
01:16:45,486 --> 01:16:47,617
- Merlin, get the plane ready.
- <i>Will do.</i>

966
01:16:47,717 --> 01:16:50,507
- Harry, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna do ev...
- You should be.

967
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:53,092
You just stay right there.
I'll sort this mess out when I get back.

968
01:16:59,659 --> 01:17:02,740
And I say to you, bear witness!

969
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:07,423
Watch the news. Watch the news... AIDS!

970
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:10,645
Floods! The blood
of the innocent spilled!

971
01:17:10,745 --> 01:17:16,615
And yet, there are those who doubt
this is the wrath of God.

972
01:17:17,652 --> 01:17:21,289
Our filthy government condones sodomy,

973
01:17:21,389 --> 01:17:24,359
divorce, abortion...

974
01:17:24,459 --> 01:17:27,153
and yet, some still doubt

975
01:17:27,253 --> 01:17:31,110
this is the work of the Antichrist!

976
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:34,602
You do not have to be a Jew,
a nigger, a whore,

977
01:17:34,702 --> 01:17:38,940
Or a atheistic,
science-lovin' evolution spouter...

978
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,775
<i>Charming sermon.</i>

979
01:17:41,075 --> 01:17:42,644
Can you see Valentine anywhere?

980
01:17:42,744 --> 01:17:45,747
So, my friends,
although he is a just God,

981
01:17:45,847 --> 01:17:48,649
he is justly a vengeful one,

982
01:17:48,749 --> 01:17:52,387
and there can be no turning back
from the Almighty...

983
01:17:52,487 --> 01:17:53,922
You sure we're out of range?

984
01:17:54,222 --> 01:17:55,724
We're over a thousand feet away.
What's wrong?

985
01:17:55,824 --> 01:17:58,891
- What if the calculations are wrong?
- You just have to trust me.

986
01:17:59,728 --> 01:18:02,756
...Jew, nigger, fag-lovers,

987
01:18:02,856 --> 01:18:06,388
and the Devil is burning them
for all eternity!

988
01:18:06,488 --> 01:18:08,392
Would you excuse me?

989
01:18:08,492 --> 01:18:11,740
Where are you going?
Hey. What's your problem?

990
01:18:13,465 --> 01:18:15,032
I'm a Catholic whore

991
01:18:15,132 --> 01:18:18,713
currently enjoying congress out of wedlock
with my black, Jewish boyfriend

992
01:18:18,813 --> 01:18:21,322
who works in a military abortion clinic.

993
01:18:21,913 --> 01:18:25,320
So, hail Satan, and have
a lovely afternoon, madam.

994
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,889
...he may, in fact, use us...

995
01:18:28,832 --> 01:18:31,860
Oh, shit. He's leaving.
I'm starting the test now.

996
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,460
Let's hope enough of these freaks
have our SIM cards.

997
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:41,439
- Might I ask you to sit down, my friend!
- Just leave this church!

998
01:18:41,539 --> 01:18:43,903
You just leave this church
like the infidel you are!

999
01:18:46,457 --> 01:18:49,811
Satan cannot save you now!
You will eat your babies!

1000
01:18:49,911 --> 01:18:53,516
You will drown in the blood of the Lord!

1001
01:18:53,616 --> 01:18:56,919
He will not save you!

1002
01:19:01,289 --> 01:19:03,556
Holy fuck!

1003
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:06,092
Shit, I can't watch this. Get over here.

1004
01:19:48,236 --> 01:19:50,071
Geez! Fuck.

1005
01:19:50,971 --> 01:19:53,024
<i>Galahad, can you hear me?</i>

1006
01:19:53,674 --> 01:19:57,212
Harry! Harry, what the heck is going on?

1007
01:19:58,512 --> 01:20:01,179
Could you turn the volume down, please?

1008
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:04,385
- I didn't expect it to be that effective.
- What kind of response are we talking?

1009
01:20:05,485 --> 01:20:07,337
A hundred percent.

1010
01:20:07,437 --> 01:20:10,391
So everyone's been affected,
whether they have a SIM card or not.

1011
01:20:10,991 --> 01:20:13,761
And we get the added benefit
of wiping out the Kingsman.

1012
01:20:13,861 --> 01:20:15,528
Not yet.

1013
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,285
Fuck!

1014
01:21:10,485 --> 01:21:13,063
Oh, you need to see this.

1015
01:23:08,954 --> 01:23:10,605
What did you do to me?

1016
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,207
I had no control.

1017
01:23:14,067 --> 01:23:16,966
I killed all those people.

1018
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,747
- I wanted to.
- Clever, isn't it?

1019
01:23:20,114 --> 01:23:22,901
In simple terms,
it's a neurological wave

1020
01:23:23,001 --> 01:23:26,521
that triggers the centers of aggression
and switches off inhibitors.

1021
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:29,755
Transmitted through your nasty,
free SIM cards, I assume.

1022
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:35,205
Do you know what this is like?

1023
01:23:35,305 --> 01:23:38,516
It's like those old movies we both love.

1024
01:23:38,616 --> 01:23:40,837
Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan,

1025
01:23:40,937 --> 01:23:44,906
and then I'm gonna come up with some
absurd and convoluted way to kill you,

1026
01:23:45,006 --> 01:23:47,942
and you'll find an equally
convoluted way to escape.

1027
01:23:48,906 --> 01:23:50,378
Sounds good to me.

1028
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:53,870
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

1029
01:23:56,936 --> 01:23:59,359
No!

1030
01:24:07,628 --> 01:24:09,393
Is he dead?

1031
01:24:09,493 --> 01:24:11,866
That tends to happen
when you shoot someone in the head.

1032
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:13,362
It feels good, right?

1033
01:24:13,462 --> 01:24:15,745
No, no, it does not feel good.
It feels fucking awful.

1034
01:24:15,845 --> 01:24:19,280
What?! You just killed how many people
in that church? This is one guy.

1035
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:22,410
No, no, no, they killed each other.

1036
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:29,115
Okay, send out the countdown clock.
This party starts... tomorrow.

1037
01:25:04,018 --> 01:25:06,033
Arthur?

1038
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:09,196
Are you there?

1039
01:25:09,296 --> 01:25:11,292
<i>Sadly, I am.</i>

1040
01:25:11,592 --> 01:25:15,059
Assemble the Kingsmen.

1041
01:25:19,233 --> 01:25:23,436
<i>Can't you see that everything I've done
has been about trying to repay him?</i>

1042
01:25:43,661 --> 01:25:45,860
<i>I see a young man with potential,</i>

1043
01:25:46,722 --> 01:25:49,594
<i>who wants to do something good
with his life.</i>

1044
01:26:06,097 --> 01:26:09,033
Arthur, Harry's dead.

1045
01:26:09,133 --> 01:26:11,542
Galahad is dead.

1046
01:26:11,642 --> 01:26:14,585
Hence, we have just drunk
a toast to him.

1047
01:26:14,685 --> 01:26:17,364
Well, then you know
what that psycho's doing.

1048
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:20,176
How many people around the world
have got those SIM cards?

1049
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:22,764
Valentine can send his signal
to any of them, all of them.

1050
01:26:22,864 --> 01:26:24,701
If they all go homicidal
at the same time, then...

1051
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:27,235
Indeed. And thanks
to Galahad's recordings,

1052
01:26:27,335 --> 01:26:30,068
we have Valentine's confession.

1053
01:26:30,168 --> 01:26:33,741
The intelligence has been passed on
to the relevant authorities.

1054
01:26:33,841 --> 01:26:35,042
Our work is complete,

1055
01:26:35,142 --> 01:26:40,180
and a most distinguished legacy
for our fallen friend, it is, too.

1056
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:42,929
And that's it?

1057
01:26:43,029 --> 01:26:45,322
Come and sit down, boy.

1058
01:26:47,371 --> 01:26:49,023
This...

1059
01:26:49,123 --> 01:26:53,480
is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy,

1060
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:57,334
and we only drink it
when we lose a Kingsman.

1061
01:26:57,434 --> 01:27:00,382
Galahad was very fond of you.

1062
01:27:02,553 --> 01:27:07,518
And on this occasion,
I think it's acceptable for us...

1063
01:27:07,618 --> 01:27:10,081
to bend the rules a little.

1064
01:27:10,811 --> 01:27:14,915
- Are these all Kingsmen?
- Yes, they're... founder members.

1065
01:27:16,015 --> 01:27:18,016
I want you to join me in a toast.

1066
01:27:20,454 --> 01:27:22,156
To Galahad.

1067
01:27:23,256 --> 01:27:25,139
To Galahad.

1068
01:27:29,406 --> 01:27:32,460
Harry says you don't like
to break rules, Arthur.

1069
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,935
- Why now?
- You're very good, Eggsy.

1070
01:27:35,035 --> 01:27:39,504
Perhaps I will make you my proposal
for Galahad's position.

1071
01:27:39,604 --> 01:27:42,442
Provided, of course,
that we can see eye to eye

1072
01:27:42,542 --> 01:27:45,652
on certain political matters.

1073
01:27:47,534 --> 01:27:49,551
Can you guess...

1074
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:51,918
what this is?

1075
01:27:52,018 --> 01:27:55,355
I don't have to; Harry showed me.
You click it, I die.

1076
01:27:55,455 --> 01:27:58,638
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

1077
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:00,474
Bravo.

1078
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:03,698
Valentine won you over... somehow.

1079
01:28:03,798 --> 01:28:06,842
Once he explained, I understood.

1080
01:28:06,942 --> 01:28:09,703
When you get a virus, you get a fever.

1081
01:28:09,803 --> 01:28:13,874
That's the human body raising
its core temperature to kill the virus.

1082
01:28:13,974 --> 01:28:16,310
Planet Earth works the same way.

1083
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:21,315
Global warming is the fever.
Mankind is the virus.

1084
01:28:21,415 --> 01:28:26,687
We're making our planet sick.
A cull is our only hope.

1085
01:28:26,787 --> 01:28:29,055
If we don't reduce
our population ourselves,

1086
01:28:29,155 --> 01:28:31,825
there's only one of two ways
this can go.

1087
01:28:31,925 --> 01:28:33,865
The host kills the virus,

1088
01:28:33,965 --> 01:28:37,370
or the virus kills the host.
Either way...

1089
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:39,946
The result is the same.

1090
01:28:40,046 --> 01:28:41,635
The virus dies.

1091
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:46,306
So Valentine's gonna take care
of the population problem himself.

1092
01:28:46,406 --> 01:28:48,893
Well, if we don't do something,
nature will.

1093
01:28:48,993 --> 01:28:54,081
Sometimes a culling is the only way
to ensure that this species survives.

1094
01:28:54,181 --> 01:28:56,401
And history will see Valentine

1095
01:28:56,501 --> 01:28:59,067
as the man who saved humanity
from extinction.

1096
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:02,589
And he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled, does he?

1097
01:29:02,689 --> 01:29:05,459
All his rich mates, they get to live,
and anyone he thinks is worth saving,

1098
01:29:05,559 --> 01:29:08,762
he's keeping them safe,
whether they agree with him or not.

1099
01:29:08,862 --> 01:29:11,031
And you... Eggsy.

1100
01:29:11,631 --> 01:29:13,734
In Harry's honor,

1101
01:29:13,834 --> 01:29:18,703
I am inviting you
to be part of a new world.

1102
01:29:20,626 --> 01:29:22,641
It's time to make your decision.

1103
01:29:29,815 --> 01:29:33,105
I'd rather be with Harry. Thanks.

1104
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:35,925
So be it.

1105
01:29:51,608 --> 01:29:54,909
The problem with us common types is...

1106
01:29:55,009 --> 01:29:57,848
that we're light-fingered.

1107
01:29:57,948 --> 01:30:00,915
Kingsman's taught me a lot, but...
sleight of hand...

1108
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:03,282
<i>Yes, they're... founder members.</i>

1109
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:08,586
...I had that down already.

1110
01:30:09,747 --> 01:30:15,368
You dirty little fucking prick.

1111
01:30:49,214 --> 01:30:51,920
It's okay, Lancelot. Put it down.

1112
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:54,326
It's verified.

1113
01:30:55,918 --> 01:30:58,705
Arthur's phone is receiving update texts
about getting to safety...

1114
01:30:58,805 --> 01:31:00,341
- we don't have a lot of time.
- What are you gonna do?

1115
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:02,861
Question is, what are we gonna do?

1116
01:31:02,961 --> 01:31:06,207
God knows who's in
Valentine's pocket and who's not.

1117
01:31:06,307 --> 01:31:08,819
We have no choice.

1118
01:31:08,919 --> 01:31:10,882
We're gonna have to deal
with this ourselves.

1119
01:31:14,354 --> 01:31:15,629
Follow me.

1120
01:31:34,579 --> 01:31:38,345
- What the fuck is this?
- I have no idea.

1121
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:42,980
What you're playing with is a prototype
personal trans-atmospheric vehicle.

1122
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,419
It was developed as part of Reagan's
Star Wars project.

1123
01:31:45,519 --> 01:31:48,489
It's pretty basic, but...
it should still work.

1124
01:31:48,689 --> 01:31:50,991
We're gonna take out
one of Valentine's satellites.

1125
01:31:51,491 --> 01:31:54,078
We're gonna break the chain,
stop the signal.

1126
01:31:54,178 --> 01:31:56,329
It'll take him a couple of hours
to reroute it,

1127
01:31:56,429 --> 01:32:00,327
which buys us enough time for you
to get me into Valentine's mainframe

1128
01:32:00,427 --> 01:32:02,934
so I can shut it down.

1129
01:32:03,034 --> 01:32:07,342
Lancelot, you're gonna be using it.
Get into your halo suit.

1130
01:32:19,386 --> 01:32:22,392
<i>Swedish Prime Minister,
requesting permission to land.</i>

1131
01:32:27,127 --> 01:32:29,073
<i>Permission granted.</i>

1132
01:32:32,699 --> 01:32:35,035
- Please.
- Thank you.

1133
01:32:35,135 --> 01:32:38,706
- So, how many more are we expecting?
- Not many. Most have their own bunkers.

1134
01:32:39,006 --> 01:32:42,142
I figure we're just getting
the really nervous ones.

1135
01:32:42,542 --> 01:32:45,078
Welcome, Prime Minister.

1136
01:32:45,878 --> 01:32:49,182
It seems the implant can emit
some kind of counter signal

1137
01:32:49,282 --> 01:32:52,777
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected
by the waves from the SIM cards.

1138
01:32:52,877 --> 01:32:54,939
The waves that turn everyone
into a psycho killer.

1139
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:57,598
Quite. But what he probably
didn't tell anyone

1140
01:32:57,698 --> 01:33:02,063
is it can also super-heat
their soft tissue at his command.

1141
01:33:02,163 --> 01:33:06,626
Valentine selected his chosen few
to get the countdown warning,

1142
01:33:06,726 --> 01:33:09,329
but he had to be sure they didn't blab
to the wrong people beforehand.

1143
01:33:09,429 --> 01:33:12,200
How does this help us right now?

1144
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,900
It doesn't. Roxy! Here we go!

1145
01:33:27,954 --> 01:33:31,458
The higher you go,
the more the balloons expand.

1146
01:33:31,558 --> 01:33:35,746
When you reach the edge
of the atmosphere, they'll explode.

1147
01:33:35,846 --> 01:33:38,029
You'll need to deploy your missile
just before that, okay?

1148
01:33:38,129 --> 01:33:39,533
The edge of the atmosphere.

1149
01:33:39,633 --> 01:33:42,770
Once you've deployed,
you'll need to release for descent fast.

1150
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:45,768
Good luck.

1151
01:33:47,507 --> 01:33:49,376
- You can do this, okay?
- Yeah.

1152
01:33:49,476 --> 01:33:52,277
Eggsy, come on! Time is not our friend.

1153
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:18,188
You're getting in on Arthur's invitation.
You're gonna need to blend in.

1154
01:34:18,288 --> 01:34:22,145
- I'm supposed to be Arthur?
- His invitation's in his phone.

1155
01:34:22,245 --> 01:34:24,971
Give them this.
Give his real name, Chester King.

1156
01:34:25,071 --> 01:34:26,914
- What about you?
- I'm your pilot... I'm gonna stay here.

1157
01:34:28,193 --> 01:34:31,785
- Is that gonna fit me?
- A bespoke suit... always fits.

1158
01:34:32,185 --> 01:34:35,723
Just be grateful Harry
had it made for you. Get dressed.

1159
01:34:37,343 --> 01:34:39,226
- What the fuck's wrong with them?
- I don't know.

1160
01:34:39,326 --> 01:34:41,295
Could have something to do
with the mass genocide.

1161
01:34:41,508 --> 01:34:43,598
Give me the mic.

1162
01:34:45,232 --> 01:34:47,000
Hey-oh!

1163
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:50,103
Everybody, listen up! Hello, hello!

1164
01:34:50,203 --> 01:34:52,239
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

1165
01:34:52,539 --> 01:34:57,945
I just want to remind you
that today is a day of celebration.

1166
01:34:58,962 --> 01:35:04,251
We must put aside all thoughts
of death and focus on birth.

1167
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:07,855
The birth of a new age.

1168
01:35:09,129 --> 01:35:14,194
<i>We mustn't mourn those
who give their lives today.</i>

1169
01:35:14,294 --> 01:35:16,163
<i>We should honor their sacrifice...</i>

1170
01:35:16,263 --> 01:35:18,299
Has she got my number to call me back?
I got a new phone.

1171
01:35:18,499 --> 01:35:22,614
<i>...and their roles
in saving the human race.</i>

1172
01:35:24,071 --> 01:35:28,772
<i>We must put aside doubt and guilt.</i>

1173
01:35:29,142 --> 01:35:33,981
You are the chosen people.

1174
01:35:34,281 --> 01:35:37,017
When folks tell their kids
the story of Noah's Ark

1175
01:35:37,117 --> 01:35:39,687
- is Noah the bad guy?
- No!

1176
01:35:39,787 --> 01:35:42,756
- Is God the bad guy?
- No!

1177
01:35:42,856 --> 01:35:45,508
How about the animals
marching two by two?

1178
01:35:45,608 --> 01:35:48,352
- No!
- Of course not!

1179
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:53,934
Yeah, that's it! Let's turn
those frowns upside down.

1180
01:35:54,034 --> 01:35:57,490
Eat, drink and party!

1181
01:36:00,607 --> 01:36:04,637
And I will see you all in the new age.

1182
01:36:28,601 --> 01:36:32,270
<i>Rox, it's me. How's the view?</i>

1183
01:36:35,042 --> 01:36:37,227
- Hideous.
- <i>Mine's pretty sweet.</i>

1184
01:36:37,427 --> 01:36:40,307
- They made you one of these suits yet?
- <i>No, not yet.</i>

1185
01:36:40,407 --> 01:36:42,916
<i>You've got something
to look forward to then.</i>

1186
01:36:43,016 --> 01:36:46,535
<i>We're coming up on Valentine's base.
Gotta go.</i>

1187
01:36:47,087 --> 01:36:49,054
<i>Good luck.</i>

1188
01:36:56,116 --> 01:36:58,737
Looking good, Eggsy.

1189
01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:02,317
Feeling good, Merlin.

1190
01:37:07,774 --> 01:37:12,076
This is November-2-4-7-Charlie-Kilo,
requesting permission to land.

1191
01:37:14,847 --> 01:37:17,348
<i>Permission is granted.</i>

1192
01:37:21,354 --> 01:37:23,777
Fuck me.

1193
01:37:50,136 --> 01:37:52,417
Eggsy, we're on.

1194
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:09,282
Chester King.

1195
01:38:09,382 --> 01:38:11,138
Mr. King, welcome.

1196
01:38:11,638 --> 01:38:14,818
I'm sure you've adhered to Valentine's
strict no-weapons policy,

1197
01:38:14,918 --> 01:38:16,844
- but if you don't object...
- Of course.

1198
01:38:16,944 --> 01:38:18,777
Thank you.

1199
01:38:18,877 --> 01:38:21,248
Do you have any luggage?

1200
01:38:21,986 --> 01:38:25,859
Congratulations, Mycroft, you just
graduated from my pilot to my valet.

1201
01:38:25,959 --> 01:38:28,288
- You cheeky...
- Understood?

1202
01:38:28,688 --> 01:38:29,756
Good.

1203
01:38:31,134 --> 01:38:32,986
Thank you.

1204
01:38:58,151 --> 01:39:01,995
<i>Eggsy, find a laptop, get me online.</i>

1205
01:39:02,095 --> 01:39:03,641
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

1206
01:39:03,741 --> 01:39:06,578
<i>And remember, try to blend in.</i>

1207
01:39:06,678 --> 01:39:09,229
Would sir care for a drink?

1208
01:39:09,329 --> 01:39:13,099
Martini. Gin, not vodka, obviously.

1209
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:17,213
Stirred for ten seconds while glancing
at an unopened bottle of vermouth.

1210
01:39:17,313 --> 01:39:19,342
Thank you.

1211
01:39:21,308 --> 01:39:23,076
Merlin, are you clocking this?

1212
01:39:23,276 --> 01:39:25,879
Yes, I am. Stay focused.

1213
01:39:25,979 --> 01:39:28,148
Lancelot, you're doing great.
Not much further to go.

1214
01:39:28,848 --> 01:39:29,883
<i>Yes, Merlin.</i>

1215
01:39:31,509 --> 01:39:33,720
<i>Eggsy, get me online now.</i>

1216
01:39:34,777 --> 01:39:36,756
Yep, I'm on it.

1217
01:39:36,856 --> 01:39:39,295
Lancelot, you're approaching
your altitude limit.

1218
01:39:39,395 --> 01:39:41,992
<i>Those balloons won't last much longer.</i>

1219
01:39:42,092 --> 01:39:44,305
<i>Prepare to engage missile.</i>

1220
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:03,339
Society's dead. Long live society.

1221
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:06,072
Amen to that.

1222
01:40:06,654 --> 01:40:08,622
- I'm Morten Lindstrom.
- Chester King.

1223
01:40:09,022 --> 01:40:10,457
How'd you get online? I couldn't.

1224
01:40:10,557 --> 01:40:14,092
It's a closed network, you see.
Pre-authorized connections only.

1225
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:19,166
<i>I've got a fix on the satellite.</i>

1226
01:40:19,266 --> 01:40:21,945
Do you have the correct time?
I think I'm still in my last time zone.

1227
01:40:22,045 --> 01:40:24,627
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's see now.

1228
01:40:37,485 --> 01:40:39,753
Eggsy, I'm in. Get your arse
back to the plane, now.

1229
01:40:39,853 --> 01:40:41,628
- <i>On my way.</i>
- Lancelot, good luck!

1230
01:40:41,728 --> 01:40:43,821
Firing in three, two...

1231
01:40:51,264 --> 01:40:53,733
- Nice and slow.
- Fuck are you doing here?

1232
01:40:53,833 --> 01:40:57,804
Well, my family were invited, obviously.
Now, get the fuck up. Slowly.

1233
01:40:58,604 --> 01:41:02,716
Oh, shit. Lancelot, hurry up and fire!
That other balloon is gonna blow!

1234
01:41:02,816 --> 01:41:05,777
Yes, Merlin. I've nearly got it.
Give me a second!

1235
01:41:07,847 --> 01:41:10,684
Valentine! I've caught a fucking spy!

1236
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:15,520
V-Glass, zoom.
Oh, fuck! It's that young valet.

1237
01:41:18,751 --> 01:41:20,600
Son of a bitch.

1238
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:21,711
<i>Got it!</i>

1239
01:41:31,879 --> 01:41:34,005
Oh, shit. Sound the alarm!

1240
01:41:35,342 --> 01:41:36,780
I'm not taking any chances.

1241
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,718
Okay, you send out the two-minute warning.
I'm starting the override.

1242
01:41:39,818 --> 01:41:41,052
All right, let's do this.

1243
01:41:42,482 --> 01:41:44,990
<i>Countdown initiated.</i>

1244
01:41:53,827 --> 01:41:55,426
- You see him?
- Right here.

1245
01:42:04,371 --> 01:42:07,238
Eggsy, take a left.
Two guards, up ahead.

1246
01:42:19,719 --> 01:42:22,009
Lancelot, release now!

1247
01:42:31,998 --> 01:42:35,133
<i>Eggsy, straight ahead, then right.
There's two more.</i>

1248
01:42:38,838 --> 01:42:42,289
All right, everybody on your feet!
Countdown to V-day!

1249
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:44,008
Welcome in the new age!

1250
01:42:52,619 --> 01:42:54,706
Flat spin!

1251
01:43:08,645 --> 01:43:11,398
<i>Eggsy, next left,
down the narrow tunnel!</i>

1252
01:43:20,297 --> 01:43:21,358
Here we go!

1253
01:43:21,458 --> 01:43:22,515
Ten,

1254
01:43:23,215 --> 01:43:24,794
nine,

1255
01:43:24,894 --> 01:43:26,718
eight,

1256
01:43:26,818 --> 01:43:28,429
seven,

1257
01:43:28,529 --> 01:43:30,073
six,

1258
01:43:30,173 --> 01:43:31,658
five,

1259
01:43:32,058 --> 01:43:34,894
four, three,

1260
01:43:35,094 --> 01:43:36,630
two,

1261
01:43:36,730 --> 01:43:38,153
one!

1262
01:43:43,711 --> 01:43:45,472
Nice! Well done, both of you.

1263
01:43:46,272 --> 01:43:50,074
It's not working! It's supposed
to be working! What the fuck?

1264
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:58,383
Yes! Well done, Rox. Good girl.

1265
01:44:01,855 --> 01:44:04,403
We've lost one of our satellites.

1266
01:44:14,033 --> 01:44:17,668
Oh, no, no. There's no way
I can hack past that.

1267
01:44:23,447 --> 01:44:25,632
What's going on?

1268
01:44:25,732 --> 01:44:27,616
Is there a problem?

1269
01:44:27,716 --> 01:44:30,581
Come on, there's no need for guns.
I'm just a pilot.

1270
01:44:33,584 --> 01:44:35,119
Fuck. Merlin!

1271
01:44:37,483 --> 01:44:38,986
Get in here!

1272
01:44:43,303 --> 01:44:45,430
Come on!

1273
01:44:48,033 --> 01:44:50,453
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- We can't.

1274
01:44:50,553 --> 01:44:53,807
I can't get into Valentine's machine.
He's got biometric security.

1275
01:44:55,394 --> 01:44:58,044
You're gonna have to get in there and make
sure his hand never touches that desk.

1276
01:44:58,957 --> 01:45:01,813
- Are you taking the fucking piss?
- I'm afraid not.

1277
01:45:05,408 --> 01:45:07,660
Let's have that then.

1278
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,300
This is mine. I'll show you yours.

1279
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:31,068
Good choice.

1280
01:45:32,415 --> 01:45:35,315
- How long to re-link the satellite chain?
- It'll take an hour, maybe two.

1281
01:45:35,415 --> 01:45:37,750
Bullshit! Just bring
these two closer together.

1282
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:40,594
But that's not yours.

1283
01:45:44,792 --> 01:45:47,360
V-Glass, call E-man.

1284
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:48,647
E, it's V.

1285
01:45:48,847 --> 01:45:51,965
Listen, man, I got a little hiccup
on this end. I need to piggyback.

1286
01:45:52,165 --> 01:45:56,227
One of my satellites just went down,
but it's right next to one of yours.

1287
01:45:56,790 --> 01:46:00,405
You read my mind. How long
before you make that happen?

1288
01:46:03,543 --> 01:46:05,042
Go.

1289
01:46:08,781 --> 01:46:10,681
All right, we should be
coming back online.

1290
01:46:13,686 --> 01:46:15,727
Ten percent.

1291
01:46:17,405 --> 01:46:21,168
Oh, shit! Eggsy, Valentine's using
someone else's satellite.

1292
01:46:21,268 --> 01:46:24,697
<i>He's going to reconnect the chain.
It's going to take him no time at all.</i>

1293
01:46:24,797 --> 01:46:27,350
It's at 20 percent.

1294
01:46:44,308 --> 01:46:46,519
Eggsy, it seems Valentine's got
a present for you.

1295
01:46:46,619 --> 01:46:48,611
<i>Get a move on!</i>

1296
01:47:21,054 --> 01:47:24,223
- Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?
- Not yet, but he will be soon.

1297
01:47:24,323 --> 01:47:26,090
Good.

1298
01:47:38,991 --> 01:47:41,258
Merlin, I'm fucked.

1299
01:47:53,169 --> 01:47:54,153
As am I.

1300
01:47:54,253 --> 01:47:57,189
They're coming at me from both sides.
I'm out of options.

1301
01:47:57,289 --> 01:48:00,089
Rox, Rox, I need a favor.

1302
01:48:00,189 --> 01:48:02,929
Call my mum. Tell her
to lock herself away from Dean.

1303
01:48:03,783 --> 01:48:07,131
And the baby, and...
tell her I love her.

1304
01:48:15,409 --> 01:48:17,358
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1305
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:24,915
Merlin, remember those implants
you said were of no use to us?

1306
01:48:26,819 --> 01:48:28,983
Any chance you can turn them on?

1307
01:48:31,792 --> 01:48:34,899
All right. My turn to play, Valentine.

1308
01:48:43,603 --> 01:48:46,205
Oh, oh, no!
No, no, what the fuck is he...

1309
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:48,711
I can't stop this.

1310
01:49:00,886 --> 01:49:02,559
Yes, please.

1311
01:49:05,425 --> 01:49:06,599
No!

1312
01:50:03,515 --> 01:50:07,587
Oh, my God! That is fucking spectacular!

1313
01:50:07,787 --> 01:50:10,723
Merlin, you're a fucking genius!

1314
01:50:10,823 --> 01:50:14,103
What the fuck is happening out there?

1315
01:50:18,354 --> 01:50:21,229
- Aren't you that princess who went missing?
- Can you get me out?

1316
01:50:21,329 --> 01:50:24,792
If I do, will you give me a kiss?
I've always wanted to kiss a princess.

1317
01:50:24,892 --> 01:50:27,974
If you get me out right now,
I'll give you more than just a kiss.

1318
01:50:29,234 --> 01:50:32,489
<i>You motherfucker. Did you
really think I was stupid enough</i>

1319
01:50:32,589 --> 01:50:34,808
<i>to implant one of those things
in my own head?</i>

1320
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:36,816
<i>What are you, fucking crazy?</i>

1321
01:50:37,863 --> 01:50:41,016
All those innocent people killed,
and for what?

1322
01:50:41,116 --> 01:50:44,578
You didn't stop shit!

1323
01:50:45,218 --> 01:50:47,247
Yeah, fine, I've locked the door.
What do you want me to do now?

1324
01:50:47,347 --> 01:50:50,163
As I said, put your daughter
in the bathroom and throw away the key.

1325
01:50:50,984 --> 01:50:53,399
It's still happening!

1326
01:50:53,499 --> 01:50:55,933
- You're fucking insane.
- <i>Just do it.</i>

1327
01:51:23,095 --> 01:51:24,681
Eggsy, the signal's started!

1328
01:51:24,781 --> 01:51:28,119
Get Valentine's hand
off that bloody desk now!

1329
01:51:28,219 --> 01:51:30,533
Sorry, love. Gotta save the world.

1330
01:51:31,958 --> 01:51:33,726
I'll be right back.

1331
01:51:35,127 --> 01:51:36,119
Good luck!

1332
01:51:42,902 --> 01:51:44,792
London.

1333
01:52:12,377 --> 01:52:14,233
Rio!

1334
01:52:29,717 --> 01:52:31,747
Get down!

1335
01:52:32,351 --> 01:52:34,455
You did it!

1336
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:44,662
The glass is not gonna hold long.

1337
01:52:46,298 --> 01:52:48,363
You stay here.

1338
01:52:50,357 --> 01:52:51,671
Merlin, quickly, how do I get up there?

1339
01:52:51,771 --> 01:52:53,604
- Keep shooting. I'll find a route.
- Understood.

1340
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:12,605
Holy fuck!

1341
01:53:29,809 --> 01:53:31,043
We're back up!

1342
01:53:32,064 --> 01:53:33,425
We're back up!

1343
01:53:40,283 --> 01:53:41,952
This is great!

1344
01:53:50,267 --> 01:53:54,432
- Eggsy! Fuckin' get on with it!
- Kick his ass, Gazy!

1345
01:54:00,773 --> 01:54:03,541
Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai!

1346
01:54:11,868 --> 01:54:14,318
Kill that motherfucker!
He killed all our friends!

1347
01:54:31,207 --> 01:54:33,717
Eggsy... the world is going to shit!

1348
01:54:43,115 --> 01:54:45,117
- Is he dead yet?!
- Not yet!

1349
01:54:45,417 --> 01:54:48,873
Stop playing with your food! Kill him!

1350
01:56:06,699 --> 01:56:08,800
Gazelle!

1351
01:56:10,002 --> 01:56:11,813
Gazelle!

1352
01:56:20,846 --> 01:56:23,601
Come on, come on!

1353
01:56:25,481 --> 01:56:27,420
Kill him!

1354
01:56:39,965 --> 01:56:42,010
Gazelle...!

1355
01:56:43,772 --> 01:56:45,817
Hey-hey!

1356
01:57:09,652 --> 01:57:10,961
<i>Well done, son!</i>

1357
01:57:12,398 --> 01:57:14,700
Yes! Yes, Eggsy!

1358
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,005
Well done, Eggsy. And you, Lancelot.

1359
01:57:20,606 --> 01:57:23,968
I'm so sorry.
Mummy would never hurt you.

1360
01:57:24,068 --> 01:57:27,663
Mummy would never hurt you.
I'm so sorry.

1361
01:57:29,879 --> 01:57:31,854
You okay?

1362
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:37,428
Harry would be proud of you, Eggsy.

1363
01:57:37,528 --> 01:57:38,622
He was right.

1364
01:57:54,073 --> 01:57:55,745
What's up, man?

1365
01:57:55,845 --> 01:57:59,042
Is this the part where you say
some... really bad pun?

1366
01:58:00,682 --> 01:58:02,546
Well, it's like you said to Harry.

1367
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:08,049
This ain't that kind of movie, bruv.

1368
01:58:09,622 --> 01:58:11,721
Perfect.

1369
01:58:31,918 --> 01:58:33,045
Eggsy, where are you going?

1370
01:58:33,145 --> 01:58:35,279
There's no need for champagne.
We got loads in the plane.

1371
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:45,689
- Did you save the world?
- Yes, I did.

1372
01:58:47,059 --> 01:58:49,762
So... you gonna come in?

1373
01:58:50,727 --> 01:58:51,995
Yes, I am.

1374
01:58:57,637 --> 01:58:59,469
Merlin, the cell's locked...
how do I get in?

1375
01:59:01,873 --> 01:59:04,707
Twenty-six, twenty-five.

1376
01:59:07,774 --> 01:59:10,914
Merlin... you're the guv'nor.

1377
01:59:12,535 --> 01:59:15,048
<i>You owe me, Eggsy.</i>

1378
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:21,391
Eggsy?

1379
01:59:27,566 --> 01:59:29,818
Oh, my word.

1380
01:59:32,130 --> 01:59:35,306
<i>The storm is breaking</i>

1381
01:59:35,581 --> 01:59:38,358
<i>Or so it seems</i>

1382
01:59:38,727 --> 01:59:41,545
<i>We're too young to reason</i>

1383
01:59:41,645 --> 01:59:44,605
<i>Too grown up to dream</i>

1384
01:59:45,136 --> 01:59:48,815
<i>Now spring is turning</i>

1385
01:59:48,915 --> 01:59:51,518
<i>Your face to mine</i>

1386
01:59:51,618 --> 01:59:54,657
<i>I can hear your laughter</i>

1387
01:59:54,757 --> 01:59:58,595
<i>I can see your smile
Slave to love</i>

1388
02:00:02,625 --> 02:00:04,624
<i>Slave to love</i>

1389
02:00:04,724 --> 02:00:07,689
<i>And I can't escape</i>

1390
02:00:07,789 --> 02:00:11,753
<i>I'm a slave to love
Slave to love...</i>

1391
02:00:16,582 --> 02:00:19,595
Michelle, turn that shit off.
It's doing my nuts in.

1392
02:00:20,405 --> 02:00:24,121
I rather like that song.
Leave it on, Mum.

1393
02:00:27,651 --> 02:00:29,570
Mugsy's back.

1394
02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:32,386
You finally come to have that word
with me, have you, son?

1395
02:00:32,486 --> 02:00:35,491
Or are you gonna run away again and pretend
you're going to court dressed like that?

1396
02:00:35,901 --> 02:00:37,197
Oh, you mean this.

1397
02:00:38,937 --> 02:00:40,786
No.

1398
02:00:40,886 --> 02:00:43,976
I know this bloke who's just taken over
a tailor's shop on Savile Row.

1399
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:47,011
He's given me a job, Mum.

1400
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:50,024
Comes with a lot of perks.

1401
02:00:50,149 --> 02:00:52,722
Including a house.

1402
02:00:52,822 --> 02:00:55,387
Come and live with me there, Mum.
Come on.

1403
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:58,290
Sit down, you.

1404
02:00:58,390 --> 02:01:01,084
Only place she'll be visiting is you
in fucking hospital. Do you hear?

1405
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:04,888
Just leave him alone, Dean!
Eggsy, go. Please, just go, babe.

1406
02:01:06,565 --> 02:01:09,558
- All right.
- Yes, do as Mummy says.

1407
02:01:09,658 --> 02:01:12,354
Why don't you ask that tailor friend of
yours to knock up a nice chicken costume...

1408
02:01:12,454 --> 02:01:14,969
it'd suit you, you mug.

1409
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,944
As a good friend once said...

1410
02:01:20,182 --> 02:01:21,378
"Manners...

1411
02:01:23,482 --> 02:01:25,451
"maketh...

1412
02:01:27,046 --> 02:01:28,632
man."

1413
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:31,040
- Hey...
- Shut the fuck up.

1414
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:35,324
Eggsy, I'm gonna shove
your manners up your fuck...

1415
02:01:39,659 --> 02:01:43,102
So... are we gonna stand
around here all day,

1416
02:01:43,202 --> 02:01:45,406
or are we gonna fight?

1417
02:01:56,518 --> 02:01:59,251
<i>Get ready for it</i>

1418
02:02:10,653 --> 02:02:13,918
<i>You said whatever you put out there</i>

1419
02:02:14,018 --> 02:02:18,658
<i>Whatever you put out there
is gonna come back</i>

1420
02:02:18,758 --> 02:02:22,065
<i>You said whenever you are ready</i>

1421
02:02:22,165 --> 02:02:26,744
<i>Whenever you are ready
just let it all out</i>

1422
02:02:26,844 --> 02:02:30,263
<i>And I know 'cause the enemy inside me</i>

1423
02:02:30,363 --> 02:02:34,925
<i>'Cause the enemy inside me
is holding me back</i>

1424
02:02:35,025 --> 02:02:38,557
<i>But we know
there's something in the silence</i>

1425
02:02:38,657 --> 02:02:41,556
<i>There's something in the silence</i>

1426
02:02:41,656 --> 02:02:44,170
<i>Get ready for it</i>

1427
02:02:49,897 --> 02:02:52,436
<i>Get ready for it</i>

1428
02:02:58,055 --> 02:03:02,095
<i>You said there's only one place
left to find</i>

1429
02:03:02,195 --> 02:03:06,298
<i>Together we can save the world tonight</i>

1430
02:03:06,398 --> 02:03:08,076
<i>Get ready for it</i>

1431
02:03:08,176 --> 02:03:11,329
<i>You said every life is a lesson</i>

1432
02:03:11,429 --> 02:03:13,429
<i>Are you a fool or a Kingsman?</i>

1433
02:03:13,529 --> 02:03:16,239
<i>'Cause only you know</i>

1434
02:03:16,339 --> 02:03:19,595
<i>Hold on 'cause the volume is rising</i>

1435
02:03:19,695 --> 02:03:24,242
<i>Yeah, the volume is rising
so you better hold on</i>

1436
02:03:24,878 --> 02:03:26,850
<i>The night is young</i>

1437
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:30,912
<i>Until it's over, until it's over</i>
