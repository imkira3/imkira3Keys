2
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,161
Hello?

3
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,211
Hello?

4
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,043
Hey! Hey! Help me!

5
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,041
Go get him.

6
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,601
Day one, Greenie.

7
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,841
Rise and shine.

8
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,044
He looks like
a slopper to me.

9
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,400
I could use some
help in the kitchen.

10
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,327
On!

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,970
Hey, we got a runner!

12
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,485
Oh!

13
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,327
Take it all in.

14
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,805
He's all yours.

15
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,961
Hey-

16
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,886
Hey there, Green Bean.

17
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,682
You're not gonna
run again. Okay?

18
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,321
Good.

19
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,491
My name is Alby.

20
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,207
Can you tell me anything
about yourself?

21
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,327
Who you are?

22
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,484
Where you came from?
Anything at all.

23
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,561
No.

24
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,370
Can you tell
me your name?

25
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,968
I, uh, I can't
remember anything.

26
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,921
Why can't
I remember anything?

27
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's okay.

28
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,646
Hey, relax.

29
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,007
Relax.

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,525
It's normal.

31
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,330
It happens to us all.

32
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,042
You'll get your name
back in a day or two.

33
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,048
It's the one thing
they let us keep.

34
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,524
What is this place?

35
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,321
Let me show you.

36
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,769
We eat here.

37
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,285
We sleep here.

38
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,805
We grow
our own food.

39
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,405
We build
our own shelter.

40
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
Whatever we need,
the Box provides.

41
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,086
The rest
is up to us.

42
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,401
The Box?

43
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,688
Yeah. It's sent up
once a month

44
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,127
With fresh supplies
and a new Greenie.

45
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,725
This month
that's you.

46
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,371
Congratulations.

47
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,250
<i>Sent up?
By who, though?
Who put us here?</i>

48
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,565
That, we don't know.

49
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,089
Hey, are you all right, Alby?
A-ha!

50
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,085
Green Bean,
meet Newt.

51
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,924
When I'm not around,
he's in charge.

52
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,764
Well, it's a good thing
you're always around then.

53
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,922
That was some dash
you made earlier.

54
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,970
For a second, I thought you had
the chops to be a runner...

55
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,929
...till you face-planted.

56
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,286
That was great.

57
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,442
Wait, a "runner"?

58
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,171
Newt, do me a favor.
Go find Chuck.

59
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,605
All right.
Thanks.

60
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,649
Look, I'm sorry
to rush this.

61
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,963
You came up a little late,
and there's a lot to do.

62
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,487
We got something special
planned tonight.

63
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,922
Yeah. You'll see.

64
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,602
I hope you're not
afraid of heights.

65
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,802
Let's go. Come on.

66
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,164
This is
all we got.

67
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,164
We've worked
hard for it.

68
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,606
If you respect
this place...

69
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,648
you and I will
get along just fine.

70
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,530
What's out there?

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,650
We only have
three rules.

72
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,320
First, do your part.

73
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,003
No time for
any freeloaders.

74
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,845
Second, never
harm another Glader.

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,082
None of this works
unless we have trust.

76
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,524
Most importantly...

77
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,927
never go beyond
those walls.

78
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,688
Do you understand
me, Greenie?

79
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,446
Hey, Alby!

80
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,806
Hey, Chuck.
Where you been, man?

81
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,285
It's basically the same
story for all of us.

82
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,522
We wake up in the Box,
Alby gives us the tour...

83
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,044
then here we are.

84
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,885
Don't worry.

85
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,008
You're already
doing better than l did.

86
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,245
I clunked
my pants three times

87
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,288
before they got
me out of the pit.

88
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,529
No, come on.

89
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,041
Dude, where
are you going?

90
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,401
I just wanna see.

91
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,120
You can look
around all you want

92
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,730
but you better
not go out there.

93
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,370
Why not?
What's through there?

94
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,251
I don't know. I just
know what I'm told.

95
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,731
And we're not
supposed to leave.

96
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,087
Hey, Chuck.
New Greenie, huh?

97
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,091
How does it feel
to be promoted?

98
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,731
Feels great, Ben.

99
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,248
I thought no one
was allowed to leave.

100
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,209
I said we're not
allowed to leave.

101
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,850
They're different,
they're runners.

102
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,729
They know more about
the maze than anyone.

103
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,166
Wait, what?

104
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,600
What?

105
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,603
What? You just
said "maze."

106
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,611
I did?

107
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,761
Yeah.

108
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,127
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

109
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,441
I'm just gonna
take a look.

110
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,090
I told you,
you can't.

111
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,766
No one leaves,
especially not now.

112
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,086
It's not safe.

113
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,443
Okay, all right,
I'm not gonna go.

114
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Hey!

115
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,131
We gotta stop meeting
like this, Greenie.

116
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,520
Get off me!

117
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,726
All right!
Calm, calm, calm.

118
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,881
Don't touch me!

119
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,644
Whoa! Take it easy!

120
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,761
Just relax.

121
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,570
What the hell is
wrong with you guys?

122
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,767
Just calm down,
all right?

123
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,888
No, okay? Why won't you
tell me what's out there?

124
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,485
We're just trying to protect you.
It's for your own good.

125
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,641
You guys can't
just keep me here.

126
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,723
I can't let you leave.
Why not?

127
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,811
What the hell?

128
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,409
Next time,
I'm gonna
let you leave.

129
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,725
Welcome to the Glade.

130
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,241
Light him up!

131
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,882
Hell of a
first day, Greenie.

132
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,601
Here.

133
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,840
Put some hair
on your chest.

134
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,680
Oh!

135
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,841
Oh, my God!
What is that?

136
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,481
I don't
even know.

137
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,490
It's Gally's recipe.

138
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,680
It's a trade secret.

139
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,689
Yeah, well,
he's still an asshole.

140
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,329
He saved
your life today.

141
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,884
Trust me. The maze
is a dangerous place.

142
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,800
We're trapped here,
aren't we?

143
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,686
For the moment.

144
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,641
But...

145
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,687
you see those guys?

146
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,005
There, by the fire?

147
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,530
Those are the runners.

148
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,724
That guy in the middle
there, that's Minho.

149
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,250
He's the Keeper
of the Runners.

150
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,166
Every morning, when those doors
open, they run the maze...

151
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,288
mapping it,
memorizing it,

152
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,646
trying to
find a way out.

153
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,650
How long have
they been looking?

154
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,240
Three years.

155
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,685
And they haven't
found anything?

156
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,242
It's a lot
easier said than done.

157
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,161
Listen.

158
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,481
Hear that?

159
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,766
It's the maze,
changing.

160
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,731
It changes
every night.

161
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,848
How is that
even possible?

162
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,491
You can ask the people
who put us in here,

163
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,688
if you ever
meet the bastards.

164
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,881
Listen,
the truth is...

165
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,485
the runners
are the only ones

166
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,050
who really know
what's out there.

167
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,362
They are the strongest and
the fastest of us all.

168
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,441
And it's a good
thing, too...

169
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,648
because if they don't make it
back before those doors close...

170
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,723
then they are stuck out
there for the night.

171
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,251
And no one has ever survived
a night in the maze.

172
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,530
What happens
to them?

173
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,448
Well, we call
them Grievers.

174
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,805
Of course, no one's
ever seen one

175
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,370
and lived to
tell about it.

176
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,930
But they're out there.

177
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,807
Right, that's enough
questions for one night.

178
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,881
Come on.

179
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,566
You're supposed to
be the guest of honor.

180
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,409
Oh, no...
No! No, come on.

181
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,925
Let me show you around.

182
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,847
Come on.

183
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,042
Whoa!

184
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,690
And there
we got the builders.

185
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,560
They're very good
with their hands...

186
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,563
but not a lot
going on upstairs.

187
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,650
And then
we got Winston...

188
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,008
he's the Keeper
of the Slicers.

189
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,529
And we got two med-jacks,
Clint and Jeff.

190
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,250
Hey, what's up?
Yo, Newt.

191
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,411
They spend most of their time
bandaging up the slicers.

192
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,484
What if I want
to be a runner?

193
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,846
Have you listened to
a word I've just said?

194
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,564
No one wants
to be a runner.

195
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,848
And, besides,
you gotta get chosen.

196
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,047
Chosen by who?

197
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,531
Whoa!

198
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,681
What do you
say, Greenie?

199
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,490
Wanna see what
you're made of?

200
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,570
Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!

201
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,290
Okay. All right.

202
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,043
The rules are
simple, Greenie.

203
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,725
I try to push you
out of the circle...

204
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,728
you try to last more than five seconds.

205
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,800
- Take it easy on the Greenie.
- Ready?

206
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,606
Get up, boy.

207
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,967
Come on, Greenie.
We're not done yet.

208
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,726
Stop calling me Greenie.

209
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,360
Stop calling you that?

210
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,921
What do you wanna
be called? Shank?

211
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,926
What do you
think, boys?

212
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,490
Does he look
like a Shank?

213
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,880
Whoa!

214
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,007
Come on!

215
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,842
You know what? I think
I've settled on Shank.

216
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,881
Oh!

217
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,371
There you go,
Greenie!

218
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,806
Not bad for
a Greenie, huh?

219
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,361
Oh!

220
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,121
Thomas.

221
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,210
Thomas. Hey!

222
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,041
Thomas!

223
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,440
I remember my name.
I'm Thomas!

224
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,481
Thomas!

225
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,645
Welcome home, Thomas.

226
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,051
Good job... Thomas.

227
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,046
What the hell
was that?

228
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,884
That, my friend,
was a Griever.

229
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,211
Don't worry, you're
safe here with us.

230
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,049
Nothing gets
through those walls.

231
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,001
All right, guys-

232
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,168
Let's tuck it in for
the night. Come on.

233
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,651
It was a good night.

234
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,246
Good job, man.

235
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,841
<i>You're safe here with us.</i>

236
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,240
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

237
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,367
<i>What's out there?</i>

238
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,124
<i>Thomas, Thomas.</i>

239
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,566
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

240
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,205
<i>Everything is going to change.</i>

241
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,841
Thomas.

242
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,687
Shh.

243
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,000
Follow me.

244
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,604
It's peaceful, isn't it?

245
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,805
I know it's hard to believe,
but it wasn't always this way.

246
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,924
We had dark days.

247
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,767
We lost a lot of boys to fear.

248
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,571
To panic.

249
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,923
We've come
far since then.

250
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,005
Established
order...

251
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,286
made peace.

252
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,484
Yeah. Why are
you telling me this?

253
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,763
Because you're not
like the others.

254
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,205
You're curious.

255
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,689
But you're
one of us now.

256
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,808
You need to know
what that means.

257
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,044
What happened
to them?

258
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,325
Like I said...

259
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,570
dark days,
Thomas.

260
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,762
Has anyone tried
climbing to the top?

261
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,209
Tried it. The ivy doesn't
go all the way to the top.

262
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,562
And besides, where are
you gonna go from there?

263
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,727
And what
about the Box?

264
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,120
You know, next
time it comes up...

265
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,725
No, we tried that.

266
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,689
The Box won't go back
down with someone in it.

267
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,121
Okay, what if we...

268
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,406
No, we tried it,
all right?

269
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,766
Twice.

270
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,731
All right? Trust me. Anything you
think of, we've already tried.

271
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,367
The only way out of here
is through the maze.

272
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,363
Now, look,
you wanna be helpful?

273
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,921
Here.

274
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,923
Go dig us up
some more fertilizer.

275
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,080
"Just get the fertilizer,
Thomas."

276
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,250
"Are you sure, guys? I can't
help in any other way?"

277
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,528
"No, just get
the fertilizer.

278
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,371
"You know where it is. It's just
out in the middle of the woods."

279
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,201
Oh!

280
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,361
Uh...

281
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,441
You're Ben, right?

282
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,364
I don't know
if we ever...

283
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,361
Are you okay?

284
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,451
Get the hell off me!

285
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,485
It's your fault.

286
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,045
I saw you.

287
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,565
You did this.

288
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,085
I saw you!

289
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,011
Hey! Hey!

290
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,325
Hey!

291
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,964
Help!

292
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,568
Help! Help!

293
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,081
Help!

294
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,081
I'll kill you!

295
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,611
Hey!

296
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,331
Hold him down.

297
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,244
What are you doing?

298
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,401
Calm down, Ben.

299
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,761
What the hell happened?

300
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,921
He just attacked me!

301
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,041
Are you okay?

302
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,201
Calm down, Ben.

303
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,244
No. No.

304
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,525
All right,
lift his shirt.

305
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,648
Lift his shirt.
No! No!

306
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,002
No! No!
Please. Please.

307
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,491
He's been stung.

308
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,846
In the middle
of the day?

309
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,011
Help me, please.

310
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,400
Please.

311
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,970
Please, just help.

312
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,561
Put him in the pit.

313
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,160
Everybody, help.
Take him to the pit.

314
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,890
No!
Med-Jack!

315
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,371
Please don't do it!

316
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,207
Calm down, Ben.

317
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,521
Back down, Ben.

318
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,769
Listen to me! Please!

319
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,844
Please, stop, please!

320
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,565
He did this!

321
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,485
Please stop! No!
No, please! Help me!

322
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,165
<i>So what happened to him?</i>

323
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,928
It's called
"The Changing."

324
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,044
It's what happens
when someone gets stung.

325
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,001
Listen.

326
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,205
We haven't been able
to get a clear word

327
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,129
out of Ben
since it happened.

328
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,128
He's not making
any sense.

329
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,406
And it's only
gonna get worse.

330
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,642
The infection
is spreading.

331
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,529
He's dangerous.

332
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,128
What did
he say to you?

333
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,250
He said he saw me...

334
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,482
and that this
was all my fault.

335
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,042
How could this
be my fault?

336
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,771
Get some rest.

337
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,650
Alby?
Yeah.

338
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,565
What's gonna
happen to him?

339
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,088
Just listen to me.
Just, please, listen to me!

340
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,765
Please, Minho!

341
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,961
Alby!

342
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,128
No, please.
Please, don't.

343
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,486
Please, don't do it.

344
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,367
Poles!

345
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,966
Move in!

346
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,008
No, no, no! Please!

347
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,645
No, please!
Please, don't!

348
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,690
I can get better!
Please, just listen to me!

349
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,650
Please, stop, please!

350
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,925
Push him in!
Stop!

351
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,925
I'll get better!

352
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,443
He belongs
to the maze now.

353
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,083
Do you think he might make it?

354
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,050
Ben?

355
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,365
No.

356
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,411
No one survives
a night in the maze.

357
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,481
We just gotta
forget about him.

358
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,770
Thomas.

359
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,808
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

360
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,770
<i>Don't make it easy on them.</i>

361
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,967
Thomas.

362
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,805
<i>Everything is going to change.</i>

363
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,170
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

364
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,680
<i>This is gonna hurt</i> a <i>little.</i>

365
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,001
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

366
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,851
<i>Thomas, you have to choose.</i>

367
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,401
But why would
Alby go into the maze?

368
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,882
I mean,
he's not a runner.

369
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,530
Things
are different now.

370
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,007
Alby went to retrace Ben's
footsteps before sundown.

371
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,161
Are you gonna help?

372
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,400
So he's gonna go back to
where Ben was just stung...

373
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,686
Alby knows
what he's doing...

374
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,206
all right?

375
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,850
He knows better
than any of us.

376
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,364
What does
that mean?

377
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,327
Well, it's like
you have heard, yeah?

378
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,450
Every month, the Box
sends up a new arrival.

379
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,204
But someone had
to be first, right?

380
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,446
Someone had to have spent a whole
month in the Glade, alone.

381
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,963
That was Alby.

382
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,642
I mean,
it can't have been easy.

383
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,961
But when those
other boys started

384
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,644
coming up,
one after the other...

385
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,802
he saw the truth.

386
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,167
And he learned that the
most important thing...

387
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,203
is that we all
have each other.

388
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,328
Because we're all
in this together.

389
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,927
Yeah.

390
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,684
There you go,
Greenie.

391
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,688
They should be back by now.

392
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,289
What happens if
they don't make it?

393
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,610
They're gonna
make it.

394
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,764
What happens
if they don't?

395
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,450
They're gonna
make it.

396
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,640
Come on, guys, can't we
send someone after them?

397
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,131
That's against the rules.

398
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,161
Either they make it
back or they don't.

399
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,167
We can't risk
losing anyone else.

400
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,525
Oh, no.

401
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,681
There!

402
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,001
Wait,
something's wrong.

403
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,044
Come on, Minho,
you can do it!

404
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,282
Come on! Go!

405
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,204
Come on,
you can make it!

406
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,885
Minho, you gotta
leave him!

407
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,610
They're not
gonna make it.

408
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,848
You
gotta leave him!

409
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,206
Thomas, no!

410
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,526
Good job.

411
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,202
You just
killed yourself.

412
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,166
What?

413
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,250
What happened
to him?

414
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,080
What does it
look like?

415
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,929
He got stung.

416
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,924
What happened
to his head?

417
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,607
I did what
I had to do.

418
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,725
Okay. Okay,
help me get him up.

419
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,121
We gotta go. The maze
is already changing.

420
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,770
Hey, Minho!

421
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,768
We can't just
leave him here.

422
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,969
We gotta get him up.

423
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,445
Come on.

424
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,162
Just sit him down.
Sit him down.

425
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,561
This isn't going to work.
We gotta go.

426
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,767
We gotta go!

427
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,241
Wait, what are you talking about?
We gotta hide him.

428
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,526
Where?
I don't know.

429
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,365
Are you telling me there's not a
single place we could take him?

430
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,689
Listen to me,
shuck-face, all right.

431
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,322
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to go!

432
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,290
You don't get it.

433
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,446
We're already dead.

434
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,690
Two, three...

435
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,405
Two, three...

436
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,406
Okay-

437
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,325
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

438
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,401
What are you doing?

439
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,609
We gotta go.
We gotta go now!

440
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,604
No, no, just a little more
and we'll tie it off.

441
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,446
Minho, stay with me.

442
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,331
Stay with me, Minho.

443
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,000
Just a little more,
we're almost there.

444
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,645
I'm sorry, Greenie.
What?

445
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,801
Minho!

446
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,365
Okay-

447
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,165
Come on.

448
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,251
Whoa!

449
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,766
Oh!

450
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,765
Oh, shit!

451
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,166
Whoa!

452
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,521
Whoa!

453
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,563
You're a crazy
son of a bitch.

454
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,969
Come on, follow me.
Come on!

455
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,402
Okay, it's changing.
Come on, come on!

456
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,685
This section is closing.
Come on.

457
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,524
We can lose
it down here!

458
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,361
Thomas!

459
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,200
What are you waiting for?
Get out of there!

460
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,041
Come on!

461
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,646
Come on!

462
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,165
Come on, Thomas!
Don't look back!

463
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,041
Run!

464
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,050
Move it, Thomas! Go on!

465
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,967
Move your ass!
Let's go! Come on!

466
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,043
Come on, Greenie!
Let's go!

467
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,011
Thomas!

468
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,127
Guys, get up!

469
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,324
I told you, Chuck.

470
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,528
They're not coming back.

471
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,890
Let's go.

472
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,605
No way.

473
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,881
Yeah!

474
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,881
Yes!

475
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,521
Yeah!

476
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,571
l got him,
I got him, I got him.

477
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,609
Watch out. Easy.

478
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,640
What happened out there?
How did you guys make it out?

479
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,201
You saw a Griever?

480
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,603
Yeah, I saw one.

481
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,289
He didn't just see it.

482
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,442
He killed it.

483
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,044
Things are changing.

484
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,644
There's no denying that.

485
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,409
First, Ben gets
stung in broad daylight.

486
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,644
And then Alby.

487
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,242
And now our Greenie, here,
has taken it upon himself...

488
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,970
to go into the maze.

489
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,483
Which is a clear violation
of our rules here.

490
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,484
Yeah...
but he saved Alby's life.

491
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,766
Did he?

492
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,847
For 3 years, we have
coexisted with these things.

493
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,002
And now, you've killed
one of them.

494
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,081
Who knows what that
could mean for us.

495
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,082
What do you
suggest we do?

496
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,251
He has to
be punished.

497
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,011
Come on.
He killed a Griever!

498
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,161
Minho.

499
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,126
You were there with him.
What do you think?

500
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,524
I think...

501
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,604
in all the time
we've been here...

502
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,650
no one has ever
killed a Griever before.

503
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,841
When I turned
tail and ran...

504
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,288
this dumb shank stayed
behind to help Alby.

505
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,810
Look, I don't know
if he's brave or stupid.

506
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,521
But whatever it is,
we need more of it.

507
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,360
I say we make
him a runner.

508
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,642
A runner? What?

509
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,009
Minho, let's not
jump the gun, here.

510
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,050
Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!

511
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,203
If you want to throw the
newbie a parade, that's fine.

512
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,044
Go ahead.

513
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,851
But if there is one thing
I know about the maze...

514
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,246
it is that you do not...

515
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,845
Okay, wait.
I know that sound.

516
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,120
The Box.
It's coming back up.

517
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,207
It shouldn't be.

518
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,960
Newt, what do you see?

519
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,445
Do you see it?

520
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,441
It's a girl.

521
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,921
No way.

522
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,763
I think she's dead.

523
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,965
What's in her hand?

524
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,082
"She's the
last one... ever."

525
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,680
What the hell
does that mean?

526
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Whoa!

527
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,085
Thomas...

528
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,246
Do you still think
I'm overreacting?

529
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,600
Jeff, what's going on?

530
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,808
What's the matter with her?
Why won't she wake up?

531
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,964
Hey man, I got my job
the same way you did.

532
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,770
Do you
recognize her?

533
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,761
No.

534
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,044
Really? Because she
seemed to recognize you.

535
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,681
What about
the note?

536
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,046
We'll worry
about the note later.

537
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,521
I think you should
worry about it now.

538
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,328
We've got enough to
deal with at the moment.

539
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,209
He's right, Newt.

540
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,810
If the Box isn't
coming back up,

541
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,370
how long do you
think we can last?

542
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,043
No one said that.

543
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,847
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

544
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,601
We'll just wait until she wakes
up and see what she knows.

545
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,880
Somebody has gotta have
some answers around here.

546
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,681
Okay-

547
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,845
Where are you going?
Back into the maze.

548
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,721
Hey-

549
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,091
Hey, Thomas.

550
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,323
What is this with you, huh?
A death wish?

551
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,642
You just got out and
now you want back in?

552
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,848
Newt said that no one
has ever seen a Griever

553
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,843
and lived to tell
about it, right?

554
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,401
Minho, now we have one.

555
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,604
You're telling me you're not
even a little bit curious?

556
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,364
Not really, no.

557
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,605
So, what's the plan?

558
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,683
You're gonna go out and dissect
that thing all by yourself?

559
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,604
I will if I have to.

560
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,289
Have the other
runners left yet?

561
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,602
The other runners
quit this morning.

562
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,445
After Alby
got stung, they're not

563
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,124
in any hurry to
get back out there.

564
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,963
Why are you?

565
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,604
I think it's time we find out
what we're really up against.

566
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,765
All right.

567
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,127
But you're not going
back out there alone.

568
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,720
Meet me in the woods
in half-an-hour.

569
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,129
Will this be enough?

570
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,005
Okay-

571
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,650
Let's go.

572
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,480
Come on!

573
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,523
That's disgusting.

574
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,370
There's something
in there.

575
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,282
You mean, besides
a Griever pancake?

576
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,961
Whoa, what are
you doing?

577
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,401
Whoa!

578
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,042
I thought you
said it was dead.

579
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,606
Was it a reflex?

580
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,886
You hope.

581
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,168
Okay, come on. Let's
try and pull it out.

582
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,524
Everyone get a hand on it.
Come on.

583
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,404
All right, ready?
On three.

584
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,369
One, two, three!

585
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,649
Are you okay, Fry?
Yeah. Thanks, brother.

586
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,205
What the hell is that?

587
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,561
Interesting.

588
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,085
Okay, whatever it is...

589
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,169
can we take this up
back at the Glade?

590
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,851
Because I don't want to
meet this guy's friends.

591
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,525
He's right.

592
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,365
It's getting late.
Come on.

593
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,801
We found this.

594
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,887
It was inside a Griever.

595
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,646
These are the same letters we
get in our supplies. Yeah.

596
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,168
Whoever put us here obviously
made the Grievers.

597
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,765
This is the
first real clue,

598
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,524
the first anything, you've
found in over 3 years.

599
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,886
Right, Minho?

600
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,166
Right.

601
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,086
Newt, we gotta
go back out there.

602
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,171
Who knows where
this might lead us.

603
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,523
You see what he's
trying to do, right?

604
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,686
First he breaks
our rules...

605
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,491
and then he tries to convince
us to abandon them totally.

606
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,400
The rules are the only thing
that have ever held us together.

607
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,921
Why now are we
questioning that?

608
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,647
If Alby was here, you
know he'd agree with me.

609
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,003
This shank needs
to be punished.

610
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,046
You're right.

611
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,929
Thomas broke the rules.

612
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,851
One night in the pit,
and no food.

613
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,731
Come on, Newt!
One night in the pit?

614
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,240
Do you think that's gonna stop
him from going into the maze?

615
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,521
No.

616
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,250
And we can't just
have non-runners

617
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,322
running into the maze
whenever they feel like it.

618
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,685
So let's just
make this official.

619
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,241
Starting from tomorrow,
you're a runner.

620
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,401
Wow.

621
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,609
Gally...
No, Fry.

622
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,686
Thanks, Newt.

623
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,811
Hey, where
are we going?

624
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,042
You'll see.

625
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,004
It's the maze.

626
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,645
All of it.

627
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,883
What do you mean "all of it"? I
thought you were still mapping it.

628
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,804
There's nothing
left to map.

629
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,440
I've run every
inch of it myself.

630
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,765
Every cycle.

631
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,405
Every pattern.

632
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,561
If there was
a way out,

633
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,483
we would have
found it by now.

634
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,807
Why haven't you
told anyone this?

635
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,967
It was Alby's call.

636
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,010
People needed to believe we
had a chance of getting out.

637
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,006
But maybe now...

638
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,765
we have a real chance.

639
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,526
Take a look at this.

640
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,411
About a year ago, we started
exploring these outer sections.

641
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,610
We found these numbers
printed on the walls.

642
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,331
Sections 1 through 8.

643
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,766
See, the way it works,

644
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,281
is every night,
when the maze changes...

645
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,329
it opens up
a new section.

646
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,926
So today,
Section 6 was open.

647
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,766
Tomorrow, it will be 4,
then 8, then 3.

648
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,241
The pattern
always stays the same.

649
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,483
What's so
special about 7?

650
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,085
I don't know.

651
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,043
But last night, when you
killed that Griever...

652
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,683
Section 7 was open.

653
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,366
I think it must be
where it comes from.

654
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,440
Tomorrow, you and I are
gonna take a closer look.

655
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,481
Hey!

656
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,800
What are you guys doing?
You're not allowed in here.

657
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,171
Sorry,
it's just the, uh...

658
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,446
It's the girl.

659
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,091
Is she awake?

660
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,561
You could
say that.

661
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,243
Chuck, what's going on?

662
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,081
Girls are awesome.

663
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,400
Leave me alone!

664
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,483
Watch your head!

665
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,166
Hey, throw one more
of those things... Ow!

666
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,765
Go away!
We come in peace!

667
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,921
What happened?
Just duck!

668
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,525
I don't think she
likes us very much.

669
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,444
What do you want from me?
We just wanna talk.

670
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,761
I'm warning you!

671
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,490
Take cover, y'all!
Take cover!

672
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,922
Hey, it's Thomas!
It's Thomas!

673
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,768
I'm gonna
come up, okay?

674
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,481
Okay-

675
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,125
Just me.

676
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,645
I'm coming up.

677
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,490
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

678
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,641
Okay, just...

679
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,165
Easy, all right?

680
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,490
Where am l?

681
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,483
What is this place?

682
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,971
Why can't I remember anything?

683
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,885
This is all normal. Okay?
We've all been through this.

684
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,161
Okay?

685
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,400
Your name will come back to
you in a couple of days.

686
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,323
It's the one thing that...
Teresa.

687
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,801
What did you say?

688
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,166
My name.

689
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,803
It's Teresa.

690
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,244
Teresa, I'm Thomas.

691
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,209
But you already knew that,
though, l guess, huh?

692
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,324
They said I kept saying
your name in my sleep.

693
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,686
Who are you?

694
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,560
I don't know.

695
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,083
I can't remember.

696
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,244
None of us here can
remember anything.

697
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,682
We all woke up here
just like you did.

698
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,525
Hey, I promise...

699
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,444
I'm gonna take this.

700
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,521
Okay.

701
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,530
What's going on up there?

702
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,884
Is she coming down?

703
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,727
Um...

704
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,200
Hey, listen, you guys just
give us a second, okay?

705
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,641
All right.

706
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,281
Come on.

707
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,888
Is this what all
girls are like?

708
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,970
That girl is crazy.

709
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,609
"She's the last one."
What does that mean?

710
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,410
I'm not sure.

711
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,080
Ever since
you came up,

712
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,770
that Box hasn't
gone back down.

713
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,325
I just think it's got
everyone a little worried.

714
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,129
Especially Gally.

715
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,603
He thinks
it's my fault.

716
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,242
Are you sure you don't
remember anything else?

717
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,011
I remember water...

718
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,690
feeling like
I was drowning.

719
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,922
These faces
staring at me.

720
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,446
And this woman's voice saying
the same thing over and over.

721
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,806
"Wicked is good."

722
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,851
Ever since I've been here,
I've had these dreams.

723
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,128
Well, I thought
they were dreams.

724
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,161
You...

725
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,283
You were there.

726
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,881
You were there...

727
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,010
and you told me that
everything was gonna change.

728
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,964
What does it mean?

729
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,169
I don't know.
I just always get pieces.

730
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,481
And the others don't
remember anything?

731
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,641
No.

732
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,330
Why are we different?

733
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,162
These were in my
pocket when I came up.

734
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,601
"W.C.K.D."

735
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,688
"Wicked is good."

736
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,881
What if we were
sent here for a reason?

737
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Alby.

738
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,163
We don't even
know what this stuff is.

739
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,850
We don't know
who sent it.

740
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,690
Or why it came
up here with you.

741
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,810
For all we know, this
thing could kill him.

742
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,490
He's already dying.

743
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,521
Look at him.

744
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,364
How could this possibly
make it any worse?

745
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,887
Come on,
it's worth a try.

746
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,725
All right.

747
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,726
Do it.

748
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,201
Okay-

749
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,249
You shouldn't be here!
You shouldn't be here!

750
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,447
No!

751
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,371
Watch out!

752
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,723
Get the syringe! Let go!

753
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,249
Well, that worked.

754
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,006
Okay, from now on...

755
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,243
someone stays here and watches
him around the clock.

756
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,091
Hey-

757
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,844
Sundown, Greenie.
Time to go.

758
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,927
Hey, what is your
problem with me?

759
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,404
Everything started going wrong
the minute you showed up.

760
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,282
First Ben, then Alby...

761
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,411
and now the girl.

762
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,043
Everybody saw
she recognized you.

763
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,646
And I'm betting
you know who she is.

764
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,121
Gally...

765
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,763
you know we can't stay
here forever, right?

766
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,281
Who's there?

767
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,561
It's just me.

768
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,680
Sorry, Chuck.

769
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,126
Here.

770
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,482
You'll run better
on a full stomach.

771
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,090
Mmm...

772
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,446
Thanks, Chuck.

773
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,324
Hey, what do
you got there?

774
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,051
Wow, that came out
pretty damn good.

775
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,566
What's that for?

776
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,003
It's for my parents.

777
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,762
You remember
your parents?

778
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,005
No.

779
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,002
I mean, I know
I must have them.

780
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,048
And wherever they are,
I'm sure they miss me...

781
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,564
but I can't miss them because
I don't remember them.

782
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,409
What do you think you're gonna
find out there tomorrow?

783
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,251
Uh, I don't know.

784
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,205
But if there's
a way out, Chuck,

785
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,089
me and Minho
are gonna find it.

786
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,601
Here.

787
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,449
Chuck, why would
you give this to me?

788
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,923
I can't remember
them anyway.

789
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,250
But maybe if you
find a way out,

790
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,970
you can give it
to them for me.

791
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,410
I'll let you
get some sleep.

792
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,326
Hey, Chuck.

793
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,121
Come here.

794
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,165
<i>Put out your hand.</i>

795
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,482
I want you to give
that to them yourself.

796
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,965
We're gonna
get out of here.

797
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,481
All of us.

798
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,807
Okay?

799
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,970
I promise.

800
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,805
Yeah.
All right.

801
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,522
Good night.
Good night, buddy.

802
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,490
Big day, Greenie.

803
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,360
Are you sure you don't
wanna sit this one out?

804
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,360
Come on, man. Get me out of here.
All right.

805
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,961
Let's go!

806
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,888
This way. Not much further
to the inner ring.

807
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,371
Let's go!

808
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,801
Come on! This way.

809
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,769
That's strange.

810
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,881
What?

811
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,247
Seven is not supposed to
be open for another week.

812
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,405
What the
hell is this place?

813
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,164
We call them blades.

814
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,168
It's Ben's, isn't it?

815
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,731
Yeah.

816
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,121
A Griever must have
pulled him down here.

817
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,451
<i>Whoa, hey!</i>

818
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,363
I think it's
showing us the way.

819
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,567
Wait, wait, wait.
What, what?

820
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,729
This way. Come on.

821
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:29,045
Minho, you ever see
this place before?

822
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,851
No.

823
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,408
It's just another
dead end.

824
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,490
Are you sure
about this?

825
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,286
Nope.

826
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,805
Grievers.

827
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,290
What the
hell was that?

828
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,804
We gotta
get out of here.

829
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,803
Give me the key,
give me the key!

830
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,726
Move, move!

831
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,169
We gotta go!
Run, Thomas!

832
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,970
We're gonna
get trapped!

833
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,326
Go! Go!

834
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,961
Go, go, go!

835
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,121
Move!

836
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,161
Minho!

837
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,850
Come on!
Let's go, let's go!

838
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,801
Come on, move!

839
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,962
Keep going!
Keep going! Let's go!

840
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,645
Whoa!

841
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,365
Go, go, go!

842
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,841
Oh!

843
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,767
Go, go, go!

844
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,651
Whoa!

845
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,364
Come on!
Don't look back!

846
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,480
Come on!

847
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,724
Oh, shit!

848
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,401
There!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

849
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,401
Oh!

850
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,445
What the hell's
going on out there?

851
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,000
What the hell you
done now, Thomas?

852
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,530
We found something,
a new passage.

853
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,806
We think it
could be a way out.

854
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,724
Really?
It's true.

855
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,326
We opened a door, something
I'd never seen before.

856
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,084
I think it must be where the
Grievers go during the day.

857
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,441
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

858
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,762
You're saying you found
the Grievers' home?

859
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,126
And you want
us to go in?

860
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,880
Their way in could
be our way out, Chuck.

861
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,287
Yeah, or there could be a dozen
Grievers on the other side.

862
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,649
The truth is, Thomas doesn't
know what he has done, as usual.

863
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,529
Yeah, at least I did
something, Gally.

864
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,761
I mean, what
have you done?

865
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,962
Aside from hide behind
these walls all the time?

866
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,480
Let me tell you
something, Greenie.

867
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,166
You've been here 3 days, all right?
I've been here 3 years!

868
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,482
Yeah, you've been here 3 years
and you're still here, Gally!

869
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,761
What does
that tell you?

870
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,410
Maybe you should start doing
things a little differently.

871
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,642
Maybe you should be in
charge, what about that?

872
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,643
Hey, it's Alby!

873
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,122
He's awake.

874
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,486
Has he said anything?

875
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,801
No.

876
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,965
Alby...

877
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,204
Alby, are you all right?

878
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,568
Hey, Alby.

879
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,971
Alby, we might have just
found a way out of the maze.

880
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,924
Do you hear me? We could
be getting out of here.

881
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,883
We can't.

882
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,290
We can't leave.

883
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,522
They won't let us.

884
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,091
What are you
talking about?

885
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,366
I remember.

886
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,442
What do
you remember?

887
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,610
You.

888
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,088
You were always
their favorite, Thomas.

889
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,126
Always.

890
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,571
Why did you do this?

891
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,121
Why did you come here?

892
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,721
Winston,
what's going on?

893
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,962
It's the doors.
They aren't closing.

894
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,321
Chuck, go to
the Council Hall

895
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,044
and start barricading the doors.
Mmm-hmm.

896
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,929
Winston, you go with him.
Got it.

897
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,521
Get the others. Tell them to go
to the forest. Go hide, now!

898
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,088
Minho, I want you to grab
every weapon you can find.

899
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,368
I'll meet you at Council Hall.
Let's go.

900
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:39,051
Teresa, you and I are gonna go
get Alby, all right? Come on.

901
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,368
All right, everybody hide!

902
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,761
Teresa!

903
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,924
Come on! Run! Run!

904
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,201
Stay down!

905
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,681
Run!

906
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,005
Ahh!
Zart!

907
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,129
Help me!
Go! Get to the village!

908
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,610
Go, go, go!

909
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,770
Stay down,
stay down!

910
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,726
Gally! Let me in,
let me in!

911
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,204
- Alby!
- Are you okay?

912
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,361
What's going on?

913
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,088
They're here.
Grievers?

914
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,010
Thomas,
what do we do?

915
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,561
It's got me!

916
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,651
Everybody, run, run, run!

917
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,211
Jeff, come on, go, go, go!

918
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,762
Everyone,
go, go, go!

919
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,167
Keep moving!
Oh, shit!

920
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,486
Ahh!

921
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,925
Alby!

922
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,560
Get behind me!

923
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,410
Come on!

924
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,726
Over here, let's go!

925
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,486
Over here!
Let's go! Come on!

926
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,000
Over here, come on!

927
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,525
Winston!

928
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,841
Get Alby inside.

929
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,370
Chuck, get in! Go, go, go!

930
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,209
Lock down the doors!

931
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,164
Careful.

932
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,651
Whoa!

933
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,960
Stay back, guys.

934
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,440
Is everyone all right?

935
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,244
Help!

936
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,164
Hey, grab him!
Help!

937
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,400
Watch out!

938
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,041
Chuck!

939
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,364
- Chuck, no!
- Grab him!

940
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,601
Pull him back!

941
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,610
Help!
Chuck, don't let go!

942
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,364
No shit!

943
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,409
- Pull!
- Don't let him go!

944
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,051
Chuck, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

945
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,767
Thanks, Alby.

946
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,685
Alby! Watch out!

947
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,921
Grab him!

948
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,722
Thomas, get them out.

949
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:21,967
Alby!

950
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,726
- No!
- Thomas...

951
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,445
- Thomas!
- Don't go out there!

952
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,647
No, Thomas, wait!

953
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,445
Thomas, wait!

954
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,285
Where is everybody?

955
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,164
Who's that over there?

956
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,128
Gally...

957
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,651
This is all you, Thomas!
Look around!

958
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,450
Back off, Gally!
It's not Thomas' fault!

959
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,560
You heard
what Alby said!

960
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,960
- He's one of them!
- One of who?

961
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,883
He's one of them,
and they sent him here

962
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,843
to destroy everything,
and now he has!

963
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,760
Look around, Thomas!
Look around!

964
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:05,961
This is your fault!

965
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,804
Back off, Gally!
This is not Thomas' fault!

966
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,645
What are you talking about?
Calm down.

967
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,560
They sent him here,

968
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,886
and now he's destroyed
everything that we've built!

969
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,450
What are you
talking about?

970
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,124
Maybe he's right.

971
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,044
Thomas...

972
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,561
I need
to remember, Teresa.

973
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,484
Thomas...

974
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,688
Thomas!
No, don't!

975
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,367
Thomas!

976
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,806
Chuck, get
the other syringe!

977
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,490
It's okay.

978
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,369
Thomas, I'm here.

979
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,481
<i>Who put us here?</i>

980
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,526
<i>That we don't know.</i>

981
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,041
Teresa...

982
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,929
<i>why are we doing this?</i>

983
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,000
<i>Excellent, Thomas.</i>

984
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,207
Come with me.

985
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,763
- Wicked isn't good.
- Thomas...

986
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,445
Wicked is good.

987
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,767
<i>How could
this be my fault?</i>

988
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,001
<i>You did this!</i>

989
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,851
<i>I saw you!</i>

990
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,047
<i>I can't keep
watching them die.</i>

991
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,530
Hey.

992
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,530
Are you okay?

993
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,724
What the hell
were you thinking?

994
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,566
What happened?

995
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,730
Gally
has taken control.

996
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,770
He said we had a choice.
Either join him...

997
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,605
or get banished
at sundown with you.

998
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,241
And the others
agreed to that?

999
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,930
Gally has everyone
convinced that

1000
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,128
you're the reason
all this has happened.

1001
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,247
Well, he's been
right so far.

1002
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,404
What are you
talking about?

1003
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,084
This place...

1004
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,241
it's not what
we thought it was.

1005
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,241
It's not a prison,
it's a test.

1006
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,082
It all started
when we were kids.

1007
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,970
They would give us
these challenges.

1008
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,126
They were experimenting
on us.

1009
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:34,323
And then people
started disappearing.

1010
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,290
Every month, one after the
other, like clockwork.

1011
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,523
They were sending
them up into the maze.

1012
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,367
Yeah, but not all of us.

1013
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,684
What do you mean?

1014
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,610
Guys, I'm one of them.

1015
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,646
The people who put you
here, I worked with them.

1016
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,205
I watched
you guys for years.

1017
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,451
The entire time
you have been here...

1018
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,642
I was on the other
side of it.

1019
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,805
So were you.

1020
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,841
What?

1021
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,801
Teresa, we did this
to them.

1022
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,006
No.

1023
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,810
That can't be true.

1024
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,408
It is. I saw it.

1025
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,322
Why would they send us
up if we were with them?

1026
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,484
It doesn't matter.

1027
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,325
He's right.

1028
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,650
It doesn't matter.

1029
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,164
Any of it.

1030
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,325
Because the people we were before
the maze don't even exist anymore.

1031
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,562
These Creators
took care of that.

1032
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,401
But what does matter is who
we are now, and what we do...

1033
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,210
right now.

1034
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,891
You went into the maze
and you found a way out.

1035
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,363
Yeah, but if I hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.

1036
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,250
Maybe.

1037
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,365
But I know that
if he were here,

1038
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,728
he would be telling you
the exact same thing.

1039
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,123
Pick your ass up
and finish what you started.

1040
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,566
Because if we do nothing...

1041
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,889
then that means Alby died for
nothing, and I can't have that.

1042
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,925
Okay-

1043
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:38,008
Okay, but we gotta
get through Gally first.

1044
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,003
This is such a waste.

1045
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:15,966
Gally...

1046
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,768
It doesn't feel
right, man.

1047
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,366
Yeah, what if
Thomas is right?

1048
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,282
Maybe he can
lead us home.

1049
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,482
We are home.

1050
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,770
Okay?

1051
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,010
I don't wanna have to cross
any more names off that wall.

1052
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,491
You really think
banishing us

1053
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,847
is gonna solve
anything?

1054
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,971
No.

1055
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,122
But this isn't
a banishing.

1056
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,127
It's an offering.

1057
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,123
What? Wait!

1058
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,248
Gally, what are you doing?

1059
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,209
You really think
I'm gonna let Thomas

1060
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,089
back into the maze
after what he has done?

1061
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,524
Look around you!

1062
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,926
Look at our Glade!

1063
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:09,490
This is the only way.

1064
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,928
And when the Grievers get
what they came here for...

1065
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,648
everything goes back
to the way it was.

1066
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,040
Are you listening
to this?

1067
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,680
Why are you all just standing there?
He's crazy!

1068
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,728
You shut up.
If you stay here,

1069
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,046
the Grievers are
going to come back.

1070
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,163
They're gonna come back, and
they're gonna keep coming back...

1071
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,481
until you're all dead!

1072
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,483
Shut up! Tie him up!

1073
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,162
Do you hear me?
I said tie him up!

1074
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,804
You're full of surprises,
aren't you?

1075
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,204
You don't have to come with
us, but we are leaving.

1076
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,647
Anyone else who wants to come,
now is your last chance.

1077
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,365
Don't listen to him, he's
just trying to scare you.

1078
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,921
No, I'm not trying to scare you.
You're already scared.

1079
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,044
I'm scared.

1080
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,966
But I'd rather risk
my life out there

1081
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,724
than spending the rest
of it in here.

1082
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,082
We don't belong here.

1083
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,451
This place isn't our home.

1084
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,044
We were put here.

1085
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,010
We were trapped here.

1086
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,007
At least, out there
we have a choice.

1087
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,282
We can make it
out of here.

1088
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,567
I know that.

1089
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,445
I'm sorry.

1090
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,601
Gally, it's over.

1091
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,760
Just come with us.

1092
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,727
Good luck against
the Grievers.

1093
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,005
Everybody,
this way!

1094
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,043
Keep it up, guys,
we're almost there!

1095
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:19,045
Is it a Griever?
Yeah.

1096
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,286
Shit.

1097
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,200
You take this, Chuck.
Stay behind us.

1098
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,886
It's okay.
Just stick with me.

1099
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,485
Once we're through,
it will activate

1100
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,846
and the door will open.

1101
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,128
We stay close,
we stick together...

1102
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,561
we get through this.
We get out now...

1103
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,802
or we die trying.

1104
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,881
Ready?

1105
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,362
All right. Let's go!

1106
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,365
Get up, look out!

1107
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,361
Push it!

1108
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,881
Look out!

1109
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,166
The key!

1110
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,561
Chuck! Watch the edge!

1111
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,447
Oh, no.

1112
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,843
I got you, Chuck!
Pull me up!

1113
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,686
Come on!

1114
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,607
Thomas! Thomas!

1115
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,161
Chuck?

1116
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,691
We got more coming!

1117
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,282
Keep it steady, guys!

1118
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,601
It works!

1119
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,769
Teresa, go!

1120
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,961
Don't back down!
Keep pushing!
Stay together!

1121
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,445
There's gotta be
a way out! Come on!

1122
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,121
Watch it!

1123
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,482
It won't open!

1124
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,081
Thomas!
There's a code!

1125
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,327
Eight numbers!

1126
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,125
Eight sections
of the maze.

1127
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,244
Hey, Minho! What's the sequence?
What?

1128
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,163
The sections of the maze,
what's the sequence?

1129
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,010
Seven! One!

1130
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,164
Five! Two!

1131
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,163
Six! Four!
Heads up!

1132
01:32:58,840 --> 01:32:59,921
Minho!

1133
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,001
Minho!
Oh!

1134
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,765
Get off of me!

1135
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,806
Jeff!

1136
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,760
What's the sequence?
Come on!

1137
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,646
Six! Four! Eight!

1138
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,370
Three! You got it?

1139
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,531
Keep holding!

1140
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,926
Almost there, come on!

1141
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,121
The door opened!

1142
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,045
Oh!

1143
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,485
Seriously?

1144
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,685
What happened here?

1145
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,523
So they were watching us.

1146
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,370
This whole time.

1147
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,570
<i>Hello.</i>

1148
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,882
<i>My name is
Doctor Ava Paige.</i>

1149
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,805
<i>I'm Director
of Operations</i>

1150
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:58,282
<i>of the World Catastrophe
Killzone Department.</i>

1151
01:36:58,440 --> 01:36:59,851
<i>If you're watching this,
that means</i>

1152
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,924
<i>you have successfully
completed the Maze Trials.</i>

1153
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,529
<i>I wish I could be there in
person to congratulate you...</i>

1154
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:12,086
<i>but circumstances seem
to have prevented it.</i>

1155
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,766
<i>I'm sure by now, you must
all be very confused...</i>

1156
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,647
<i>angry...</i>

1157
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,290
<i>frightened.</i>

1158
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:21,603
<i>I can only assure you, that
everything that's happened to you...</i>

1159
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,046
<i>everything we've done
to you...</i>

1160
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,248
<i>it was all done
for a reason.</i>

1161
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,649
<i>You won't remember...</i>

1162
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,565
<i>but the Sun has
scorched our world.</i>

1163
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,880
<i>Billions of lives
lost to fire...</i>

1164
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,761
famine...

1165
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:42,250
<i>suffering
on a global scale.</i>

1166
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,404
<i>The fallout
was unimaginable.</i>

1167
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,811
<i>What came after was worse.</i>

1168
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,125
<i>We called it the Flare.</i>

1169
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,727
<i>A deadly virus that
attacks the brain.</i>

1170
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,723
<i>It is violent...</i>

1171
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:59,405
<i>unpredictable...</i>

1172
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,129
<i>incurable.</i>

1173
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,970
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

1174
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:09,007
<i>In time, a new
generation emerged</i>

1175
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,889
<i>that could survive
the virus.</i>

1176
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:14,567
<i>Suddenly, there was a
reason to hope for a cure.</i>

1177
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,491
<i>But finding it
would not be easy.</i>

1178
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,769
<i>The young would have to be
tested, even sacrificed...</i>

1179
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,282
<i>inside harsh environments...</i>

1180
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,488
<i>where their brain activity
could be studied.</i>

1181
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,970
<i>All in an effort
to understand.</i>

1182
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,282
<i>what makes them different...</i>

1183
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,324
<i>what makes you different.</i>

1184
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,608
<i>You may not realize</i> it...

1185
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,127
<i>but you're very important.</i>

1186
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:44,324
<i>Unfortunately, your trials
have only just begun.</i>

1187
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,522
<i>As you will no doubt
soon discover,</i>

1188
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,682
<i>not everyone agrees
with our methods.</i>

1189
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:52,003
<i>Progress is slow,
people are scared.</i>

1190
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,766
<i>It may be too late for us...</i>

1191
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,683
for me...

1192
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,205
<i>but not for you.</i>

1193
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,929
<i>The outside world awaits.</i>

1194
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,931
<i>Remember...</i>

1195
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,805
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

1196
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,085
Is it over?

1197
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,848
She said we were
important.

1198
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,528
What are we supposed to do now?

1199
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,764
I don't know.

1200
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,924
Let's get out of here.

1201
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,601
<i>No.</i>

1202
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:19,930
Gally?
Don't.

1203
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:22,849
He's been stung.

1204
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,771
We can't leave.

1205
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,802
We did.
Gally, we're out.

1206
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,206
We're free.

1207
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:43,726
Free?

1208
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,202
You think we're
free out there?

1209
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,641
No.

1210
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,087
No, there's no escape
from this place.

1211
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,725
Gally, listen to me.

1212
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,167
You're not
thinking straight.

1213
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,921
You're not.

1214
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,802
Now, we can help you.

1215
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,322
Just put down the gun.

1216
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,849
I belong to the maze.

1217
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,729
Just put down
the gun.

1218
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,165
We all do.

1219
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,331
Thomas...

1220
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,611
Chuck.

1221
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,123
Oh, shit. Shit.

1222
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:56,531
Look at me,
look at me!

1223
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:58,881
Oh, shit!

1224
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,530
Chuck,
look at me, all right?

1225
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,205
I got you, buddy.
Just hang on.

1226
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,211
It's okay.

1227
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,045
Thomas, Thomas...

1228
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,522
No, Chuck. You're gonna
give it to them yourself.

1229
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,681
Remember,
I told you that.

1230
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,040
Take it.

1231
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:17,846
No.

1232
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,401
Thank you.

1233
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,561
Thank you.

1234
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,040
No, Chuck,
you're gonna get...

1235
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,721
Chuck.

1236
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,084
Chuck? Hey.

1237
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,729
Hey, Chuck, come on!

1238
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,284
Come on, wake up!

1239
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,081
Damn it!

1240
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,963
We made it.
Come on.

1241
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,684
I'm sorry!

1242
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,251
God damn it!

1243
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,603
Damn it!

1244
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:17,761
- Thomas.
- Chuck!

1245
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:23,687
Get up, Chuck! Come on!

1246
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:37,921
Chuck!

1247
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,443
You can't just
leave him there!

1248
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,520
You guys all right?

1249
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,401
Don't worry.

1250
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,925
You're safe now.

1251
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,090
Relax, kid.

1252
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,801
Everything is gonna change.

1253
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,928
I think it's safe to say the Maze
Trials were a complete success.

1254
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,967
<i>I wasn't expecting
so many survivors, but...</i>

1255
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,240
<i>the more the merrier.</i>

1256
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,406
<i>Thomas continues to
surprise and impress.</i>

1257
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,526
<i>And for now, they seem
to have taken the bait.</i>

1258
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,563
<i>It's too soon to</i> say...

1259
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:50,402
<i>but they could be
the key to everything.</i>

1260
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,605
<i>So let's move forward.</i>

1261
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:59,443
It's time now
to begin Phase Two.

1261
01:46:00,305 --> 01:47:00,403
