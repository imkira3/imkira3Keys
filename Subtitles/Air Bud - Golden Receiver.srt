00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,137
HE MIGHT NEED SOME HELP.

00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,447

177
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,689
IF HE COULD
TAKE ME TO THE MOVIES.

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,338
YOU SHOULD
GO ON A DATE, MOM.

183
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,345

00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,508
I MUST BE
IN THE WRONG HOUSE.

207
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,279
I WAS EXPECTING JACKIE FRAMM,
NOT CINDY CRAWFORD.

208
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,881

YOU KNOW, I'M NOT JUST
THINKING ABOUT MYSELF.

212
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,297
I'M ALSO THINKING
ABOUT JOSH AND ANDREA.

213
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,200
MAYBE IT'S TOO SOON
FOR ME TO BE DATING.

214
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,468
DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO SOON?

215
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,808
MAYBE I'M JUST NOT MEANT
TO FALL IN LOVE AGAIN.

216
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,710
- OHH OHH!

225
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,202
BUD--BUDDY...

234
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,069

SO, UH, WHAT TIME

00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,408
NOW, WHEN DID YOU
BECOME THE MOM

238
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,609
AND ME THE ADOLESCENT?

239
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,845

I, UH, LEFT MY IRON

247
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,801

YOUR HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO.

248
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,938

PLAIN WHITE TRUCK,

280
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,387
NOT MUSICAL TRUCK.

281
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,389

00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,192
IT CAME WITH ALL
THE ICE CREAM YOU COULD EAT.

283
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,227

OHH. OOF!

295
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,963
IF HIS NUMBER'S BEEN
PROGRAMMED INTO YOUR SPEED DIAL,

296
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,166
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO SHOPPING

297
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,437
- AH.

298
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,473

299
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,608

303
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,487
HE'S TRYING TO BRIBE YOU.

304
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,124

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,367
NICE.

306
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,769

WRONG NUMBER.

316
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,643

318

319
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,313

333
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,414

LEAVE A MESSAGE
AFTER THE BEEP.

335
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,060

FOOTBALL PRACTICE?

336
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,768
- TOUCHDOWN.

337
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,471
- UHH!

338
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:39,906
- THAT'S IT, ON THE BREAK!

339
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,079
cheerleaders: WHEN I SAY
BOOGIE, YOU SAY DOWN!

340
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,784

341
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,725

- AH, HI.

350
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,506
- WE WERE WONDERING
IF YOU STILL GOT ROOM

351
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,741
FOR A COUPLE MORE PLAYERS?

352
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,576
- I ALWAYS GOT ROOM
FOR PLAYERS ON MY TEAM.

353
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,144
WHAT POSITIONS
DO YOU PLAY?

354
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,178
- I'M WIDE RECEPTOR.

355
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,913

356
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:21,914

00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,115
AND YOU?

358
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,784
- OH, WELL, I'M--
I MEAN, WHATEVER.

359
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:25,785
YOU KNOW, I COULD...

360
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:26,986
- HE'S A QUARTERBACK.

361
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,455
HE'S GOT A KILLER ARM.

362
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,122
LET'S SEE.

363
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,424

YOU, UH, PUT THIS ON.

366
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,128
GO AHEAD, GO DEEP.

367
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,431
TOWARD THE END ZONE, DEEP.

368
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,199
COME ON, LET'S SEE
THAT KILLER ARM.

369
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,534
- LOOK OUT.

370
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:43,002
ALL RIGHT, HURRY UP.

371
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,844

372
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,680

376
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,986
- YOU KNOW, I COULD USE
A BACKUP QUARTERBACK.

377
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:04,123
- YOU BACK UP
COLE POWERS OVER THERE.

378
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,659
HE'S THE HOTTEST QUARTERBACK
IN THE LEAGUE RIGHT NOW.

379
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,827
YOU MIGHT NOT GET
MUCH PLAYING TIME.

380
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,462
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

381
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,531
MY PRACTICES ARE NO PICNIC.

382
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:12,865
CAPISCE?

383
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,134

I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

384
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,168

385
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,804

398
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:03,683
OHH!

399
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,897
Andrea: WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME MORE TEA, BUDDY?

400
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,773
- WHEW.

401
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,146

00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,131
OHH!

408
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,269
- OW.

409
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:00,106
- YOU JOINED
THE FOOTBALL TEAM?

410
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,608

411
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,942
YEAH, I LOVE FOOTBALL.

412
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:07,079

417
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,188
OKAY.

418
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,190
- BRING DOWN YOUR PANTS TOO.

419
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,493

420
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,296
HEY, BOY.

421
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,198
OH, NOT NOW, BOY.

422
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:30,269
MY HEAD HURTS.

423
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,771
- IT'S OKAY.

424
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,775
- IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK,
TOM, I JUST KNOW IT.

425
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,545
- TRAVELING DOCTORS ARE WORSE
THAN TRAVELING SALESMEN.

426
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,713
HE'S PROBABLY GOT A WOMAN
AT EVERY PORT.

427
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:44,016
OKAY, WELL, JUST GO IN THERE

429
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,653
- WHAT SEEMS
TO BE THE TROUBLE?

430
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,588
- HIS HIP BONE.
- HIS TAIL BONE.

431
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:54,994
- H-HIS TAIL.

432
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,897
YOU KNOW...
THE BONE IN HIS TAIL.

433
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,231
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, HIS TAIL,

434
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,233
IT JUST HASN'T BEEN ITSELF
LATELY, YOU KNOW.

435
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,369
- MM, YOU KNOW, NO WAG.

436
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,807
- WELL, YEAH, I MEAN,

437
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,341
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE TAIL THAT DOESN'T WAG.

438
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,877
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

439
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,047
- YEAH, SO, UH...

440
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,316
OH, UM...

441
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,719
WELL, YOU SEE, TOM AND I
KIND OF FIGURED OUT

442
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,021
THAT--THAT IT ONLY WAGS
WHEN HE'S LYING DOWN AND...

443
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,691
- NOT WHEN HE'S STANDING,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

444
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,427
- HMM.

445
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,164
WELL, IT, UH,
LOOKS FINE TO ME.

446
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,100
BUT IF IT'LL MAKE YOU BOYS
FEEL BETTER,

447
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,603
WE'LL GET IT X-RAYED
JUST TO MAKE SURE.

448
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,605
- OH, GREAT.

449
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:41,073
- COME ON, BUDDY.

450
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,343
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

451
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,245
- THANK YOU.
- YEP.

452
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,950
- TOM, I DON'T FEEL
RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

453
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,885
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR, ANYWAYS?

454
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,087
- ANYTHING THAT'LL SHOW
THAT THIS GUY'S

455
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,989
A ROAMING ROMEO.

456
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,693

457
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,194
I MEAN,
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.

458
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,764
I MEAN, HE'S GONNA CATCH US.
LET'S GO, ALL RIGHT?

459
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,198
- WAIT, WAIT, WHOA.

460
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,266

660
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,741
COME ON.
IT AIN'T THE END OF THE WORLD.

661
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,809
COME ON, PUT ONE UP
ON THESE CLOWNS.

662
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,213
YOU'RE THE MAN, JOSH!

663
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,631
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S TRY B-52 AGAIN.

664
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:20,832
TRUST ME,
IT'LL WORK THIS TIME.

665
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:21,833
READY?

666
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,034
- BREAK!

667
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,976
- 52!

668
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,112
- SET! HIKE!

669
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,282
- HE'S OPEN!
HE'S OPEN!

670
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,217
Salter: JOSH IS GOING ON!

671
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,225
Salter: AND IT'S
A PERFECT PASS!

672
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,961
RIGHT TO...A DOG!

673
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,329
- BUDDY.

674
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:54,733
THERE IS A DOG
ON THE FIELD.

675
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:58,136
AND HE'S DOING A LOT BETTER
THAN THE TROJANS!

676
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,538
- UHH!

677
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:03,375
- UHH!

678
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:10,782
- UHH!

679
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,186
- WHOA!

680
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,988
Salter: AND TOUCHDOWN!

681
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,526
- YES!

682
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,835
- SO THAT'S THE FAMOUS
AIR BUD, HUH?

683
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,537
AMAZING DOG.

684
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,338
GREAT FORM.

685
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,607
HE REMINDS ME A LOT
OF FRED BILETNIKOFF.

686
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:37,476
EXCEPT HE'S BETTER LOOKING
THAN FRED.

687
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,214
YOU ALL RIGHT?

688
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,187
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT A GREAT ARM
ON YOU OUT THERE, SON,

689
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,122
BUT...IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE PLAYING

690
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,592
FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS.

691
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,927
FOOTBALL'S ALL ABOUT
HAVING FUN.

692
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:59,097
THAT'S GOT TO BE
YOUR BOTTOM LINE, JOSH.

693
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,766
COME ON.

694
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:02,300
SEE YA.

695
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:10,776
- I KNOW YOU WANT
TO PLAY ON THE TEAM, BOY.

696
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,445
BUT YOU JUST CAN'T,
YOU KNOW?

697
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:16,214
'CAUSE FOOTBALL'S
NOT LIKE BASKETBALL.

698
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,449
'CAUSE YOU MIGHT GET HURT,

699
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:19,384
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT, DO IT?

700
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,120
AND YOU GOT TO WEAR EQUIPMENT
AND A HELMET.

701
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,989
I KNOW IT'S NOT FAIR.

702
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,153
- HEY, BOY.

703
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:06,565
PERFECT.

704
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:18,877
BOY, TRY THIS ON.

705
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,912
UHH.

706
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:23,882
- COME ON, GUYS, COME ON.

707
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,050
GUY, COME ON, MOVE IT.

708
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,785
COME ON, GUYS,
MEET ME HALFWAY HERE.

709
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,054
STOP. WE GOT A LOT OF WORK
TO DO HERE.

710
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,298
- GOT A NEW WIDE RECEPTOR
FOR YOU.

711
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,700
- WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF A JOKE?

712
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:42,801
- WELL, NO.

713
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,002
I MEAN, LIKE YOU SAID,

714
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,136
THERE'S ALWAYS
ROOM ON YOUR TEAM

715
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,337
FOR A COUPLE MORE PLAYERS.

716
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,039
- COME ON,
DOGS DON'T PLAY FOOTBALL.

717
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,741
- YEAH, THEY DON'T PLAY
BASKETBALL EITHER, RIGHT?

718
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:51,076
- COME ON, COACH,

719
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:52,811
WE'LL BE THE LAUGHING STOCK
OF THE LEAGUE.

720
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,479
- HAVE YOU ALL FORGOTTEN
WE'VE BEEN THE LAUGHING STOCK

721
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,414
OF THE LEAGUE
FOR THE LAST DECADE?

722
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,750
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
FELLAS, FELLAS, FELLAS.

723
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:01,452
COME ON, WHOA, WHOA.
QUIET DOWN HERE, COME ON.

724
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,356
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS, JOSH?

725
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,926
- READY TO HAVE
SOME FUN, COACH.

726
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:11,262
BOTTOM LINE.

727
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,531
- ALL RIGHT.

728
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:16,935
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS POOCH
IS MADE OF.

729
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,269
- GO, SET!
HIKE, HIKE!

730
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:26,444
- UP, DOWN.
KICKERS TOO, JUAN.

731
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:29,581
NO KNEES, WEEBLE.
UP, DOW--

732
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:32,751
THAT'S THE WAY
TO DO IT, BOYS.

733
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,597
- YEAH!
- YEAH!

734
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,736
- I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING, BOYS.

735
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,303
THAT AIN'T
NO GOLDEN RETRIEVER.

736
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:55,040
THAT THERE
IS A GOLDEN RECEIVER.

737
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,242
HEY HEY, THERE HE IS.

738
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,544
SAY HELLO
TO YOUR NEW TEAMMATE, FELLAS.

739
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:07,653
* OR THE LAND

740
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:12,290
* OF THE FREE

741
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:16,227
* AND THE

742
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,797

743
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,233

00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:26,304

745
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:34,913
*

746
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,315
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON, NOW.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

747
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,449
COME ON.

748
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:40,819
- THAT'S IT.

749
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:42,620
GOOD BOY.

750
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:46,024
- RAMS!

751
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,526
- UHH!

752
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,962
WE'RE GONNA KICK
SOME RAM BUTT TODAY.

753
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,330
I CAN FEEL IT.

754
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:55,133
- AAH!

755
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,167
UHH!

756
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:00,605
- SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
MR. CONFIDENT?

757
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,108
- SINCE I GOT MY HANDS
ON A GENUINE

758
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,977
JERRY RICE NOSE SPREADER.

759
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:07,045
- COME ON, NOW.
HIT SOMEBODY OUT THERE.

760
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:08,546
- OKAY, COACH.
NO PROBLEM.

761
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,115
- I DON'T WANT TO SEE A GREEN
SHIRT STANDING, ALL RIGHT?

762
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,217
LET'S GO, OFFENSE!

763
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,285
ALL RIGHT, JOSH.
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

764
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,288
- HEY, BUDDY,
JUST LIKE WE PRACTICED.

765
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:18,389
LET'S GO.
COME ON.

766
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:19,390
Salter: KICK IT, GIRLS!

00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:20,726

NAVY BLUE AND GOLD!

772
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,309

00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,145
man: OH, THAT'S SO CUTE!

774
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,146

775
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,080

AWW!

808
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,923
- THAT IS ONE
TALENTED DOG.

809
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,593
YOU'RE DOING FINE TOO, JOSH,
YOU KNOW?

810
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:45,096
YOU JUST NEED TO...
FACE UP TO THE PRESSURE.

811
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,898
NOT DESERT THE POCKET
TOO EARLY.

812
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:52,837
- I FOUND THESE
IN YOUR OFFICE.

813
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,305
WHO ARE THEY?

814
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:01,679
- WELL...

815
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,747
THAT'S LAURA.

816
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,184
SHE LIVES IN SEATTLE.

817
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,386
AND THAT'S GAIL.
SHE'S IN SANTA FE.

818
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:11,189
AND THE PRETTY ONE
WITH THE RED HAIR,

819
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,590
THAT'S SHANNON MARIE.

820
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,591
SHE'S IN BOSTON.

821
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,393
- SO...

822
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,730
- AND THIS IS A PICTURE

823
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:21,199
OF THE WHOLE SULLIVAN CLAN.

824
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,767
SEE, THERE'S MOM AND DAD
AND ME AND...

825
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,303
- YOUR THREE SISTERS.

826
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:31,642
- YOU KNOW, JOSH,
I THINK WE COULD BE FRIENDS.

827
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,646
FIRST, WE GOT TO LEARN
TO TRUST EACH OTHER.

828
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,450
"BROKEN TAIL."

829
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,557
- OH, PATRICK,
THIS IS SO ROMANTIC.

830
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,293
- IF I DIDN'T HAVE
TO FIX THE ENGINE,

831
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:49,460
WE COULD HAVE BEEN...

832
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:51,296
- NO, I THINK
THIS IS PERFECT.

833
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:00,005
- WELL...

834
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:03,574
I'VE BEEN OFFERED
A PERMANENT JOB IN SAN DIEGO.

835
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:08,613
BUT...I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GOING TO ACCEPT IT.

836
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,482
- OH.

837
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:15,586
I-I DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATE
THINGS FOR YOU.

838
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,322
BUT I WILL,
IF YOU INSIST.

839
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,460
- I THINK JOSH WOULD BE
VERY HAPPY

840
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,195
TO SEE ME LEAVE TOWN.

841
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:31,636
- WELL, IN LIEU OF GROWING
FUR AND A TAIL,

842
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:35,840
FOR NOW...
JUST BE HIS FRIEND.

843
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,054
- ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME HANDS!
GIVE ME HANDS!

844
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,388
HOW WE GONNA PLAY?

845
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:51,622
- ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH!

846
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,724
- ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH!

847
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,460
- LET'S GET 'EM!

848
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:09,074
- UHH!

849
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:26,824
- 25! DOWN!

850
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:27,925
SET! HUT!

851
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,964
- YES!

852
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,113
- SO YOU RUN X-CURL,

853
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:50,448
AND BUDDY
IN THE DEEP FLY PATTERN.

854
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:51,616
STRAIGHT UP THE MIDDLE.

855
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:54,252
BETTER KNOWN
AS THE CANINE KNOCKOUT.

856
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,053
THIS IS THE ONE
FOR ALL THE MARBLES.

857
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:58,389
AFTER THAT, I WANT TO DO
A COUPLE OF MOTION THINGS.

858
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:42,233
- YES!

859
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:43,634
- YES! YES!

860
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,470
YES! YES!

861
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:50,441
COME HERE, PUDGY!

862
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:53,110
YEAH! WE DID IT,
LITTLE GUY, WE DID IT!

863
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:56,181
- WHEN JOSH THREW THAT PASS
TO BUDDY

864
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,748
AND HE SCORED THE HOMERUN,

865
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,650
THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HAVE A HEART ATTACK.

866
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:01,286
- TOUCHDOWN.
- OH, FOOTBALL IS SO DRAMATIC.

867
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:02,920
YEAH.

868
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,023
HMM.

869
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:09,126
- I'VE COME TO A DECISION
ABOUT THAT CONSULTING JOB

870
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,228
IN SAN DIEGO.

871
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,299
- YOU'RE GONNA ACCEPT IT.

872
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,237
- ONLY IF YOU DON'T
ACCEPT THIS.

873
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,174
OHH.

874
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,242
PATRICK.

875
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:30,114
OHH.

876
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,291
- NOTHING.

877
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:43,461
I MADE YOU A CAKE.
SHAPED LIKE A FOOTBALL.

878
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,563
ISN'T IT CUTE?

879
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:09,687
JOSH, PLEASE.

880
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:12,450
NO, BUDDY.
YOU CAN'T COME.

881
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:21,926
I MEAN IT, BUDDY, STAY.

882
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:03,668
- WAY TO GO, NATALYA!

883
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:08,773
*

884
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,722
- IT'S JACKIE FRAMM.

885
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:27,224
UH, JOSH HAS RUN AWAY.

886
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,826
IS HE THERE WITH YOU?

887
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,565
- JOSH ISN'T
AT TOM'S HOUSE.

888
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:37,635
UH, I'LL TRY
COACH FANELLI.

889
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,336
- THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

890
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,340
- TRAIN NUMBER 14
FROM PORTLAND

891
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:44,475
IS DELAYED 20 MINUTES

892
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,310
AND WILL BE ARRIVING
ON TRACK TWO.

893
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,579
THAT'S TRAIN NUMBER 14
FROM PORTLAND

894
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:51,582
ARRIVE 20 MINUTES LATE
ON TRACK TWO.

895
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:02,927
- YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE MOST
ABOUT TRAIN STATION FOOD?

896
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,929
THERE'S NOTHING
EVEN REMOTELY ITALIAN

897
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:06,497
ABOUT THE ITALIAN SUBS.

898
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:09,066
- OH, HI, COACH FANELLI.

899
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,602
YOU MIND IF I GRAB SOME WOOD?

900
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:13,771
- SURE.

901
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:18,909
- EH...I RAN AWAY
MORE THAN A FEW TIMES

902
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,511
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

903
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,179
USUALLY,
I GOT ABOUT THIS FAR.

904
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,614
- HMM.

905
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:25,282
I'M LEAVING.

906
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:28,719
- SAN FRANCISCO.

907
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:32,089
- BOY, MY STAR QUARTERBACK
IS WILLING TO PASS UP

908
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,024
THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
THIS AFTERNOON,

909
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,060
IT MUST SOMETHING
PRETTY SERIOUS.

910
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:38,429
- HMM.

911
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:39,930
- NOPE.

912
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,100
- IT WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

913
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:47,104
WITH THE NEW MAN IN YOUR MOM'S
LIFE, NOW, WOULD IT?

914
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,940
WOULD IT?

915
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:51,375
- HE'S NOT MY DAD,
ALL RIGHT?

916
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,712
- NO, I GUESS HE ISN'T.

917
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,847
AND YOU LOVED YOUR FATHER
VERY MUCH.

918
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:02,286
AHEM, SO...

919
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,088
SO WHERE YOU HEADING
AFTER FOOTBALL SEASON?

920
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:05,890
- I'M RUNNING AWAY,
REMEMBER?

921
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,658
- YEAH, I KNOW, WELL,
I MEAN, THEORETICALLY,

922
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:08,959
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WEREN'T
RUNNING AWAY,

923
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:11,261
WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING?

924
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:12,463
- I DON'T KNOW.

925
00:57:12,497 --> 00:57:14,431
PROBABLY PLAY BASKETBALL
OR SOMETHING.

926
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:15,933
- HMM.

927
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,167
WELL,
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

928
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,268
THE WAY YOU'VE
GOTTEN INTO FOOTBALL,

929
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,571
BASKETBALL WAS OUT.

930
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:22,272
- I NEVER SAID IT WAS OUT.

931
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:23,508
I STILL LOVE BASKETBALL.

932
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,942
IT'S JUST
THAT I LOVE FOOTBALL TOO.

933
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:28,813
- YOU CAN...

934
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:35,986
- YOU LIKE THIS GUY PATRICK,
JOSH?

935
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:39,990
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU GOT TO STOP

936
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,926
LOVING YOUR FATHER,
YOU KNOW.

937
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,530
YOUR MOM HASN'T.

938
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:47,264
- TRAIN NUMBER NINE
TO SAN FRANCISCO

939
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,000
WILL BE ARRIVING
IN FIVE MINUTES ON TRACK ONE.

940
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:52,770
- THAT'S ME.

941
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:56,273
- I GUESS THIS
IS ARRIVEDERCI HUH, JOSH?

942
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,975
GOOD LUCK, KID.

943
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,510
- OH, UM...

944
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:03,447
I KIND OF OVERHEARD
YOU AND MS. SALTER TALKING.

945
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,151
SHE SAID THAT THEY WERE GONNA
GET A NEW FOOTBALL COACH.

946
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:08,218
I'M SORRY.

947
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:09,620
- AH, DON'T SWEAT IT.

948
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:12,122
I ONLY COACH
'CAUSE I LOVE THE KIDS.

949
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,858
IF WINNING'S ALL
THEY'RE INTERESTED IN,

950
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:16,026
I'M NOT THE RIGHT GUY
ANYWAY.

951
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:20,931
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, KID.

952
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:27,838
- HEY, COACH...

953
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:29,006
UM...

954
00:58:31,776 --> 00:58:37,181
IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE, UM...

955
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:39,183
CAN I GET A RIDE HOME
WITH YOU?

956
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,352
- SURE, KID.
COME ON.

957
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,959
- DON'T MIND IF WE
STOP FOR A SLICE OF PIZZA?

958
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:11,448
- OH, GOD, JOSH.

959
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,618
JOSH.

960
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:15,620
OH, I WAS SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

961
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:16,921
- MOM.

962
00:59:16,954 --> 00:59:20,224
- PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER
DO THAT AGAIN, JOSH.

963
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:21,592
PROMISE ME.

964
00:59:21,626 --> 00:59:22,960

00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,798

WHERE'S PATRICK?
I GOTTA TALK TO HIM.

968
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:37,074
- PATRICK'S GONE, HONEY.

969
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:41,946
- HE'S TAKEN A JOB
IN SAN DIEGO.

970
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:45,149
HE'S LEAVING
ON HIS BOAT TOMORROW.

971
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:51,055
- IT WAS TOO SOON.

972
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,589
- I'M SORRY.

973
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:53,824
I'M SORRY.

974
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:02,967
- I THOUGHT HE WAS WITH YOU.

975
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,607
- BUDDY!

976
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:18,148
BUDDY!

977
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:26,356
BUDDY!

978
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:31,595
HE'S NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

979
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,263
HE'S NEVER RUN AWAY.

980
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,365
- BUDDY CAN TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF, HONEY.

981
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:36,667

984
01:00:49,046 --> 01:00:55,119

1058
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,229

1059
01:05:34,198 --> 01:05:35,932

IS GOING TO TRY TO PUT
SOME POINTS ON THE BOARD.

1073
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:10,934
THEY'RE GONNA GO

1074
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,136

Fred: NO, IT HIT
WEEBLE'S HELMET,

1078
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,175
AND IT'S WAY OFF

1079
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,777
WELL, I GUESS THAT WASN'T SUCH
A GOOD DECISION AFTER ALL,

1080
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,845
WAS IT, PHIL?

1081
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:23,280
- I'LL TELL YOU,
THAT COULD GIVE YOU

1082
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,848
SOME KIND OF HEADACHE.

1083
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,683
YOU KNOW, YOU GET HIT
WITH A...

1084
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:28,185

01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,983
IT'S INTERCEPTED.
NOWHERE NEAR RECEIVER.

1093

1097
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:11,428
HE'S--AH, BOY.

1098
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:13,563
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER SCORE FOR THE GIANTS.

1099
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:14,564
OH, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN--

1100
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:15,732

1108
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:30,747
I'VE GOT A NET!

1109
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,282
- NOT NOW, POPOV!
CAN'T YOU SEE I AM BUSY?

1110
01:07:32,316 --> 01:07:33,350

1115
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,024
NATALYA!

01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,859
AAH!

1117
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,295
NATALYA! AAH!

AAH!

1125

- WHY DON'T YOU
GET YOURSELF DOWN

1126
01:07:58,308 --> 01:08:00,277
AND CLEAN UP THIS MESS
THAT YOU HAVE CREATED?

1127
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,884
Fred: WELL, PHIL,

1128
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,587
COACH FANELLI
TAKES A HEAVY ANCHOR

1129
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,889
THROUGH THE HALFTIME
LOCKER ROOM.

1130
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,291
DOWN 24 TO NOTHING.

1131
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:16,793
DISAPPOINTED, DOWNTRODDEN...

1132
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:19,796
[marching band
playing on TV]

1133
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,132
*

1134
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,776
- HEY, COACH...

1135
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:34,411
ARE YOU GONNA TELL US
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR STORIES?

1136
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,513
- YOU BETTER BELIEVE I AM.

1137
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,350
- THIS IS THE STORY
OF A FOOTBALL TEAM.

1138
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:42,652
FROM THE BEGINNING,
THIS FOOTBALL TEAM

1139
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:44,521
HAD HEART AND ABILITY.

1140
01:08:44,554 --> 01:08:46,956
BUT THERE WAS ONE
BIG PROBLEM.

1141
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,292
THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE...

1142
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:50,527
THAT THEY COULD WIN.

1143
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,095
AND THEN THIS DOG
CAME ALONG.

1144
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,464
AND THIS DOG COULD DO
AMAZING THINGS.

1145
01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:58,268
AND SUDDENLY,
THE TEAM STARTED WINNING.

1146
01:08:58,302 --> 01:09:00,370
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

1147
01:09:00,404 --> 01:09:03,440
EVEN WITHOUT THE DOG,
THEY WERE WINNERS.

1148
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:07,177
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM.

1149
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:08,945
SO IF YOU BELIEVE

1150
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,481
THAT A DOG
CAN PLAY FOOTBALL,

1151
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:14,818
THEN YOU BETTER BELIEVE
THAT WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS GAME.

1152
01:09:20,724 --> 01:09:23,960
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
LET'S GET OUT THERE

1153
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,963
AND GIVE THEM SOME
OF THAT RAZZLE DAZZLE!

1154
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,632
ROUGH.

1155
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:29,633
ROUGH!

1156
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:30,667
all: ROUGH!

1157
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,302
ROUGH!

1158
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:33,803
ROUGH! ROUGH!

1159
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,972
ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH!

1160
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,707
ROUGH! ROUGH!
ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH!

1161
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,811
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.
WAY TO GO, MARCO.

1162
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:44,080
COME ON, BABY.

1163
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,982
IT WORKED, BUDDY.

1164
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,920
all, chanting:
TIMBERWOLVES! TIMBERWOLVES!

1165
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:53,357
TIMBERWOLVES!
TIMBERWOLVES!

1166
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,759
Fred: GIANTS
ON THE ATTACK AGAIN.

1167
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:58,262
HERE'S MARTIN, BACK TO PASS.

1168
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:00,029
HE'S LOOKING--
OH, AND HE GETS HIT

1169
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:01,498
JUST AT THE LAST MINUTE.

1170
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:02,499
TOOK A LITTLE OFF THAT BALL!

1171
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:03,900
GOOSE STEPS IN,
HE HAS IT!

1172
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,269
IT'S A INTERCEPTION.

1173
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:07,337
- GO, GOOSE! GO! GO!

1174
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:08,672
- THE 35!

1175
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,408
- GO! GO!
GO, GOOSE, GO!

1176
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:12,576
- UHH! OOF!

1177
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:13,943
Fred: WELL!

1178
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:15,912
THAT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE BIT
OF INSPIRATION

1179
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,381
FOR THE OLD TIMBERWOLVES,
DOESN'T IT?

1180
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:18,848
Phil: IT JUST PROVES
MY THEORY.

1181
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,216
Fred: WHAT IS THAT, PHIL?

1182
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:23,887
Phil: SCORE MORE POINTS
THAN THE OTHER TEAM,

1183
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,590
AND, BY GOLLY,
YOU'RE GONNA WIN!

1184
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:29,626
- ALL RIGHT! YEAH!

1185
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:31,127
- UH...

1186
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:35,732
- RIGHT, GO, GO.

1187
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:45,475
- UHH!

1188
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:49,979
- UHH!
- OOF!

1189
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:56,786
- RAAAHR!

1190
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:13,970
- YES! YEAH!

1191
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,305
- THAT'S GREAT.

1192
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,107
- UHH!

1193
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:19,142
MOTHER?

1194
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,780
AAH! THE ANIMALS!

- "FISH GUTS."

1196
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:34,958
OHH!

[Natalya and Popov
sputtering]

1198
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,969

1199
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:47,303
GET UP!

1200
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:53,142

- AAAAH!

1205

- NO!
- OHH!

1206
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:25,875
- GET THE VAN!

1207
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:28,512
IT'S GOT THE VAN!

1208
01:12:35,452 --> 01:12:37,521
- AAH!

1209
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58,608
- I DON'T KNOW.

1210
01:12:58,642 --> 01:12:59,909
- BUT THERE IS DOG.

1211

both: DOG!

1212
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:07,584
- AHH!

1213
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:29,372
NOW WE'VE GOT HIM.

1214
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,940
- YOU DID IT!

1215
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:32,375

IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

1222
01:13:58,034 --> 01:14:00,103
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU TOO.

1223
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:01,671
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN AT THE DOCKS?

1224
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:03,072
DON'T YOU HAVE
A GAME TO PLAY?

1225
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:04,508
HUH?

1226
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:05,975
COME ON.

[indistinct
police radio chatter]

- DO YOU HAVE
A PLAN "B"?

1229
01:14:13,717 --> 01:14:15,451
- WE ARE RUSSIAN CITIZENS!

1230
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:18,788
WE DEMAND YOU TAKE US
TO THE RUSSIAN IMBECILE!

1231
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:21,791
- IT'S EMBASSY, IMBECILE!

1232
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:24,460
- AAH!

1233

Fred: MARTIN DROPPING BACK.

1234

VOSS--OH, IS HE
IN THE CLEAR!

1235
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:36,940
THERE ISN'T A TIMBERWOLF
AROUND FOR 20 YARDS.

1236
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,107
TOUCHDOWN!

1237
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:40,877
LOOKS BAD NOW
FOR THE OLD TIMBERWOLVES.

1238
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,682
OOH, EEH.

1239
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,188
- NOW, COME ON, NOW,
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

ANCIENT HISTORY.

1241

JOSH, JOSH, COME HERE.
GET IN HERE.

1242

COME HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

WE'RE GONNA GET THEM
WITH A LITTLE DOUBLE TROUBLE.

1244
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,397
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S GO!

1245
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,132
BUT, COACH, WE'VE NEVER
DONE A DOUBLE TROUBLE

1246
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,333
WITHOUT BUDDY.

1247

- WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO IT WITHOUT BUDDY.

01:15:24,788 --> 01:15:26,089
LISTEN TO THAT AUDIENCE.

Fred: THE OLD AIR BUD
IS BACK IN THE GAME!

1260
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,173
- YEAH, THIS DISPELS
THAT RUMOR, HEH HEH.

1261

01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:11,434
DOUBLE TROUBLE!

1268

01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:16,606
HANDOFF, DOUBLE REVERSE.

1270
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,107
DOUBLE REVERSE AND...

01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:19,776
IT'S OFF TO AIR BUD!

1272
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:21,244
AND HE'S OFF!

1273
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:22,478
HE'S DOWNFIELD!

1274

CHASING HIM.

HAS SURE PUT THE TIMBER

1283
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:03,787
BACK IN THESE TIMBERWOLVES.

1289
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:37,854
Fred: ANOTHER SCORE!

1290
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:40,223
Phil: THAT IS JUST AMAZING.

1291
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:42,959
Fred: IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE
IN THE END ZONE

1292
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,728
WITH AIR BUD.

1293
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:46,062
- HE'S GOT FLEAS.

1294
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:47,130
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
HE DOESN'T HAVE FLEAS.

1295
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:49,365
- YAY, BUDDY!

1296
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:52,035
Fred: AIR BUD HAS CERTAINLY
TIGHTENED UP THIS GAME

1297
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:53,402
FOR THE TIMBERWOLVES.

1298
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:55,071
BUT THEY'RE GONNA NEED
ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN

1299
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:56,072
IN ORDER TO WIN.

1300
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:58,507
AND NOW...
THIS COULD BE IT!

1301
01:17:58,541 --> 01:17:59,843
- BUDDY!

1302
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:05,048
Fred: OHH, NO, 184-POUND
CRUSHING TACKLE BY TYLER.

1303
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:08,251
AND AIR BUD IS DOWN.

1304
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:11,087
TEAMMATES RUSHING
ONTO THE FIELD NOW, TRAINERS.

1305
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,856
AIR BUD, WE SEE MOVEMENT.

1306
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:14,758
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY, I'M ALL RIGHT.

1307
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,425
GET THE DOG.
- EXCUSE ME.

1308
01:18:16,459 --> 01:18:19,095
COMING THROUGH.

1309
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:21,597
- I DON'T KNOW.

1310
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,099
- JUST HANG ON.

1311
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:25,735
- HE'S NOT SURE YET.

1312
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:32,776
- HE'S GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT, JOSH.

1313
01:18:32,809 --> 01:18:34,043
WHY DON'T YOU GET OUT THERE
AND FINISH THE GAME.

1314
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:38,681
- IT'S OKAY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

1315
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,350
- GET UP, BUDDY, COME ON.

1316
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,086
- COME ON, JOSH.

1317
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:44,120
HE'LL BE OKAY.

1318
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:47,423
- JOSH, LET'S GO.

1319
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:48,724
- I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

1320
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:50,559
Fred: WELL, THIS CERTAINLY
IS A CRUSHING BLOW.

1321
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:53,262
POOR AIR BUD,
OUT OF THIS GAME.

1322
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:54,363
- OH, I JUST--

1323
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:55,598
- WELL, LET'S HOPE
THAT THESE GUYS

1324
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:57,934
CAN GO ON BY THEMSELVES.

1325
01:18:57,967 --> 01:19:00,970
- READY!

1326
01:19:01,004 --> 01:19:02,371
SET!

1327
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,372
HIKE, HIKE!

1328
01:19:05,008 --> 01:19:06,275
- UHH!

1329
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,712
- OH!

1330
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,580
- THIRD DOWN COMING UP.

1331
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:13,149
WHAT DO YOU THINK, PHIL?
- WELL, I THINK THAT--

1332
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:15,118
- THIRD DOWN,
HE'S BACK FOR ANOTHER PASS.

1333
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:16,953
Phil: HE'S GONNA PASS THERE.
THAT'S WHAT.

1334
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,455
- UHH!

1335
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:25,761
- YEAH!
- ALL RIGHT!

1336
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:27,964
Fred: WELL, IF THERE'S
A MIRACLE IN THE MAKING,

1337
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:29,933
IT BETTER
SHOW UP NOW, PHIL,

1338
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:31,500
BECAUSE THIS
IS THE LAST CHANCE.

1339
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:33,669
WE GOT TEN SECONDS
LEFT IN THIS GAME.

1340
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:37,506
- WELL, TEN IS ENOUGH
IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT.

1341
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:41,077
- SOMETIMES, YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO PLAY CARDS, YOU KNOW.

1342
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,311
- YEAH...

1343
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:45,014
- COME ON, TOM, GET UP.
WE GOT A GAME TO PLAY.

1344
01:19:45,048 --> 01:19:46,850
- I CAN'T FIND
MY NOSE SPREADER.

1345
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:48,184
- FORGET ABOUT
YOUR NOSE SPREADER, TOM.

1346
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:50,153
- BUT I CAN'T CATCH
WITHOUT IT.

1347
01:19:50,186 --> 01:19:52,355
- TRUST ME, TOM,
YOU DON'T NEED IT.

1348
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:55,558
- IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

1349
01:19:58,661 --> 01:19:59,628
- THIS IS OUR LAST SHOT,
JOSH.

1350
01:19:59,662 --> 01:20:01,030
- I KNOW.

1351
01:20:01,064 --> 01:20:03,199
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S DO B

1352
01:20:03,232 --> 01:20:04,600
CROSSING PATTERN.

1353
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,936
DEEP.

1354
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,337
- THAT'S 60 YARDS.

1355
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:10,439
YOU CAN'T THROW
60 YARDS.

1356
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:12,275
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

1357
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,143
- I'M POSITIVE--YOU GUYS
GOT TO TRUST ME, ALL RIGHT?

1358
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:16,112
- WE'RE WITH YOU, JOSH.
- YOU JUST RUN.

1359
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,713
ALL RIGHT, ON TWO.
READY...

1360
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,315
- BREAK!
- LET'S ROCK.

1361
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:21,550
- HEY, GUYS, LOOK!

1362
01:20:29,993 --> 01:20:32,795
- COME ON, GUYS, LET'S GO.
COME ON. PLAY.

1363
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,397
- WHAT ABOUT
MY NOSE SPREADER?

1364
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:00,523
- WHEW.

1365
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,735
- ALL RIGHT!
READY!

1366
01:21:12,768 --> 01:21:15,671
B-52!

1367
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,441
DOWN, SET,
HIKE, HIKE!

1368
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:21,377
- UHH!

1369
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,452
- GET OFF!

1370
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:46,435
- UHH!

1371
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:09,959
- YEAH!

1372
01:22:22,038 --> 01:22:23,072
- YES!

1373
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:02,645
- WHOO! ALL RIGHT!

1374
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:04,313
OH, HONEY,
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

1375
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:07,483
- CONGRATULATIONS, JOSH.

1376
01:23:12,021 --> 01:23:13,822
YOU GOT POTENTIAL.

1377
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:17,226
I GOT POTENTIAL!

1378
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,162
I GOT POTENTIAL!

1379
01:23:28,204 --> 01:23:31,240
I GOT POTENTIAL!

1380
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:32,675
- AAH!

1381
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,448
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

1382
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:17,920
- PATRICK!

1383
01:24:17,953 --> 01:24:20,256
PATRICK!

1384
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:21,924
PATRICK!

1385
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:25,594
PATRICK!

1386
01:25:02,298 --> 01:25:03,299
UM...

1387
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:14,410
- DON'T GO.

1388
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,611
PLEASE DON'T GO.

1389
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:51,046
- THIRD AND THREE.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO HERE?

1390
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:52,515
- HUH, LET ME SEE.

1391
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:55,218
I-I THINK I'D GO LONG
TO JOEY GALLOWAY.

1392
01:25:55,251 --> 01:25:56,952
- BLUE-38!

1393
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:57,953
- GOOD CALL.

1394
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,222
THEY'RE NOT EXPECTING THAT.

1395
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:00,556
- HMM.

1396
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:18,441
- OH, NO.
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

1397
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:36,725
*

1398
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:56,945
* WHEN I WAS ALONE

1399
01:26:56,979 --> 01:26:59,348
* AND FRIGHTENED

1400
01:26:59,382 --> 01:27:03,118
* I ALWAYS FELT LIKE

1401
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:06,389
* NO ONE WAS THERE

1402
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:09,758
* IT SEEMED HOPELESS

1403
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:13,429
* TO DREAM THAT SOMEONE

1404
01:27:13,462 --> 01:27:17,433
* WOULD EVER HOLD ME

1405
01:27:17,466 --> 01:27:21,270
* AGAIN

1406
01:27:21,304 --> 01:27:24,273
* ONE MOMENT

1407
01:27:24,307 --> 01:27:27,910
* WAS MORE THAN I NEEDED

1408
01:27:27,943 --> 01:27:31,580
* TO KNOW THAT I HAD

1409
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:34,283
* FALLEN FOR YOU

1410
01:27:34,317 --> 01:27:38,421
* OH, I SAW SOMETHING

1411
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:42,124
* THAT CHANGED ME FOREVER

1412
01:27:42,157 --> 01:27:45,461
* THE MOMENT I MET YOU

1413
01:27:45,494 --> 01:27:48,263
* I KNEW

1414
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:56,071
* WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES

1415
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,307
* ALL I SEE IS

1416
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:02,311
* THE MAGIC OF YOUR SMILE

1417
01:28:02,345 --> 01:28:09,685
* AND UP ACROSS THE SKY

1418
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:13,856
* WE WOULD TRAVEL
THE MOONLIGHT *

1419
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:17,125
* FOR MILES

1420
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:22,465
* I WANT IT TO LAST ME

1421
01:28:22,498 --> 01:28:28,704
* MY LIFETIME
AND THEN SOME *

1422
01:28:28,737 --> 01:28:34,643
* I NEED YOU TO WANT ME

1423
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:36,945
* LA DA DA DA

1424

1427
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:50,793
* JUST LIKE THAT

1428
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:54,463
* LOVE HAS SURPRISED ME

1429
01:28:54,497 --> 01:29:01,537
* AND TAKEN ME OUT
FOR THE RIDE OF MY LIFE *

1430
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:05,173
* AND IT SURE FEELS IT

1431
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:08,911
* WHENEVER YOU TOUCH ME

1432
01:29:08,944 --> 01:29:11,246
* PLEASE HOLD ME
TILL THE END *

1433
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:14,750
* OF MY LIFE

1434
01:29:14,783 --> 01:29:22,791
*

1435
01:29:36,439 --> 01:29:40,342
* WE WILL FOLLOW
THE MOONLIGHT *

1436
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,679

1437
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,615
