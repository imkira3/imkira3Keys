<i>If you have a fever and cough
or sore throat...</i>

3
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,897
<i>stay home.</i>

4
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,126
<i>I'd say 95% chance this is manufactured.
Came out of a laboratory.</i>

5
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,997
<i>The source of the virus was traced back...</i>

6
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,436
<i>to drug testing done at
Gen-Sys Laboratories in San Francisco.</i>

7
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,825
<i>The lab technician now known
as Patient Zero...</i>

8
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,730
<i>was accidentally exposed to
retrovirus ALZ-113...</i>

9
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,633
<i>an Alzheimer's trial drug
that was being tested on chimpanzees.</i>

10
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,934
<i>The infected chimps showed signs
of erratic and aggressive behavior...</i>

11
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,906
<i>that led to their escape from the facility.</i>

12
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,273
<i>The now-famous incident
on the Golden Gate Bridge...</i>

13
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,346
<i>a six-hour standoff with police...</i>

14
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,006
<i>ended with the apes disappearing
into Muir woods.</i>

15
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,757
<i>Emergency rooms are being overwhelmed
with patients showing signs...</i>

16
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,696
<i>of what's being dubbed
"The Simian Flu."</i>

17
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,018
<i>The CDC is projecting a fatality toll...</i>

18
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,526
<i>ranging from 5 million
to as many as 150 million...</i>

19
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,924
<i>in the next 6 to 8 months.</i>

20
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,466
<i>Anyone showing signs of a contagious illness
will receive special treatment here...</i>

21
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,103
<i>the airport's purpose-built
quarantine center.</i>

22
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,207
<i>Many of the new arrivals are children
who have lost contact with their parents.</i>

23
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,843
<i>The mandatory quarantines
have sparked civil unrest.</i>

24
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,876
<i>Families are being ripped apart.</i>

25
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,548
<i>Containment is not very likely.</i>

26
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,320
<i>Prepare your families.
Know your evacuation route.</i>

27
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,886
<i>The survival rate is now
approximately 1 in 500.</i>

28
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,125
<i>Violence erupted in the city center tonight.</i>

29
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,701
<i>The third incident in as many days.</i>

30
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,192
<i>Martial law has been declared in 28 nations...</i>

31
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,067
<i>including the U.S. and Canada.</i>

32
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,721
<i>The reactor is overheating.
We can't stop a meltdown.</i>

33
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,743
<i>Just a total collapse of anything
resembling civilian order.</i>

34
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,338
<i>Due to the extremity of the
Simian Flu crisis...</i>

35
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,238
<i>all regular government functions
have been suspended indefinitely.</i>

36
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,417
<i>Those who aren't killed by the virus...</i>

37
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,413
<i>will probably die in the fighting.</i>

38
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,646
<i>So, maybe this is it.</i>

39
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,858
<i>This is how it ends.</i>

40
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,559
<i>Pretty soon...</i>

41
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,705
<i>there won't be anyone left.</i>

42
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,531
Caesar...

43
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,206
They are close.

44
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,731
Koba!

45
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,824
Now, father?

46
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,861
Son, stay...

47
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,929
Thank you, Koba.

48
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,623
Think before you act, son.

49
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,261
Don't feel bad, Blue Eyes...

50
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,700
Scars make you strong.

51
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,798
Come meet your new brother.

52
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,198
Another son.

53
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,903
Makes me think how far we've come,
Maurice.

54
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,871
Seems long ago.

55
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,115
Still think about them?

56
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,538
Humans?

57
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,985
Sometimes.

58
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,729
Didn't know them like you did.

59
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,328
Only saw their bad side.

60
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,091
Good, bad... doesn't matter now.

61
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,898
Humans destroyed each other.

62
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,818
Apes fight too.

63
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,736
But we are family.

64
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,861
Wonder if they're really all gone.

65
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,314
Ten winters now...

66
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:19,086
Last two... no sign of them.

67
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,140
They must be gone.

68
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,874
That bear wouldn't get me Blue Eyes. I'm quick!

69
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,062
Shut up, Ash!

70
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,548
Oh, God.

71
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,422
It's okay.

72
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,131
It's okay. It's okay.

73
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,321
Freeze!

74
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,667
Stay!

75
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,108
Help!

76
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,282
Help!

77
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,438
No!

78
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,795
Hey!

79
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,355
Over here!

80
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,235
I shot him! I shot him.

81
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,904
They shot Ash! Shot my son!

82
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,071
Rocket, wait...

83
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,027
We don't mean any harm!

84
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,085
They're apes, man. You think
they understand what you're saying?

85
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,119
Do they look like just apes to you?

86
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,624
Dad.

87
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:07,635
Malcolm, what are you doing?

88
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,023
- Dad?
- Malcolm.

89
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,266
It's okay.

90
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,309
Put your guns down.

91
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,269
- You can't be serious.
- Do it.

92
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,111
Go!

93
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,052
Holy shit.

94
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,210
Holy shit.

95
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,315
Okay. Okay, we're going.

96
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,836
Go!

97
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,587
Slowly.
Go, go, go!

98
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,063
My bag!

99
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,225
Go!

100
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,095
Koba!

101
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,255
Follow!

102
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,268
Did you find it?

103
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,701
We need to talk.

104
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,776
What? What's wrong?

105
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,046
The dam is pretty much intact.

106
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,163
It could probably start generating
power for us within a week.

107
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,757
But there is a problem. Get in.

108
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,538
I shot him.

109
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,700
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.

110
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,707
Jesus Christ.
How many were there?

111
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,943
A lot. Like, 80.

112
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,279
- At least.
- Okay...

113
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:39,208
you're not hearing what he's saying.
They spoke!

114
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,824
That is not possible.

115
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,847
I'm telling you, Dreyfus,
they did and it was incredible.

116
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,724
Incredible? They're talking apes!

117
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,877
- With big-ass spears!
- Please!

118
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,867
I don't know exactly what you think
you saw or heard...

119
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,539
but you have to calm down, okay?

120
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,808
What about the virus, Ellie?
Any chance of contagion?

121
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,127
We're all genetically immune
or we would've been dead a long time ago.

122
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,530
You don't know that for sure.

123
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,074
She worked with the CDC.
She knows.

124
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,023
What are we gonna do?

125
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,845
I don't know.

126
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,881
We need that power.

127
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,022
He could've killed us, but he didn't.

128
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,704
Maybe he kept us alive,
so they could follow us.

129
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,861
They find out where we are,
and they kill us all!

130
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,280
What do you mean, "he"?

131
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,012
That's what we're trying to tell you.

132
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,986
It was unlike anything you've
ever seen before, and the leader...

133
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,630
He was remarkable.

134
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:26,882
Really?

135
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,146
- Is that what you thought?
- It's what we saw.

136
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,357
Yeah, it's what we all saw.

137
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,806
Not a word of this back at the colony,
you understand me?

138
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,778
Not a word
until we can figure out what to do.

139
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,393
- You gotta be kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

140
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,900
I don't want to create a panic.

141
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,372
How are you doing, pal?
Are you okay?

142
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,561
- I dropped my bag.
- I know.

143
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,721
- Was your sketchbook in there?
- It's gone.

144
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,094
Carver just told me we're not gonna tell
anybody what happened up there.

145
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,942
Not yet. No.

146
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,925
Must attack them now!

147
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,133
Before they attack us!

148
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,849
We don't know how many there are.

149
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,333
How many guns they have?

150
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,446
Or why they came up here?

151
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,351
They shot your son, Rocket!

152
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,333
Don't you want to fight?

153
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,323
I follow Caesar.

154
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,864
Koba's right!

155
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,829
They almost killed you, Ash!

156
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,241
No!

157
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,780
If we go to war...

158
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,622
We could lose all we've built...

159
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,386
Home.

160
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,957
Family.

161
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,595
Future.

162
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,214
I will decide by morning.

163
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,781
Caesar.

164
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,280
For years I was a prisoner in their lab...

165
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,270
They cut me...

166
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,700
Tortured me.

167
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,705
You freed me.

168
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,016
I would do anything you ask.

169
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,881
But we must show strength!

170
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,856
We will, Koba.

171
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,862
Coming through. Coming through.

172
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:52,301
That's a hell of a lot more than eighty!

173
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,151
Malcolm!

174
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,730
Apes...

175
00:23:56,568 --> 00:24:00,652
do not want war...

176
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,672
but will fight...

177
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,793
if we must.

178
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,605
Ape home.

179
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:49,372
Human home.

180
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,185
Do not come back.

181
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,435
Everyone!

182
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,103
Everyone, you have to calm down!

183
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,816
Everybody.

184
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,429
Everybody!

185
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:58,271
Please! We're all immune!

186
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:02,859
We're all immune,
or we wouldn't still be here!

187
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,484
How did they find us?

188
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:06,918
We found them.

189
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,487
- You knew they were out there!
- What if they come back?

190
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,431
Yeah!

191
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,265
If they come back...
If they come back...

192
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,499
they'll be sorry they ever did!

193
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,599
Now, this city may not have the
manpower it once did...

194
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,646
but it has the firepower.

195
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,283
Those stockpiles left behind...

196
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:31,047
by FEMA, the National Guard,
we have it all.

197
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,985
Look...

198
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,992
I know why you're scared.

199
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:41,481
I'm scared, too, believe me.

200
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,389
But I recognize the trust
you've all placed in me.

201
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,838
We've been through hell together.

202
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:54,335
But you all know
what we're up against.

203
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,103
We're almost out of fuel.

204
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,376
Which means no more power...

205
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,036
which means we could slip back
to the way things were.

206
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:11,218
That dam up there was the answer.

207
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,283
We just had no idea
they were up there, too.

208
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,445
So, what do we do now?

209
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,684
Yeah!

210
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,737
We find another way...

211
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,538
because that power...

212
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,405
is not just about keeping the lights on.

213
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,101
It's about giving us the tools...

214
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,613
to reconnect to the rest of the world.

215
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,651
To find out who else is out there...

216
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,052
so that we can start to rebuild...

217
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,810
and reclaim...

218
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,481
the world we lost.

219
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,785
That was a great speech.

220
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,843
There is no alternative power source.

221
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,972
That dam is the only option.

222
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,350
Well, then, we fight them.

223
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,306
We're two weeks away
from running out of fuel.

224
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,508
Maybe three, tops.

225
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,790
I know.

226
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,115
And once that happens...

227
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,849
I won't be able to go out
there with a bullhorn...

228
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,339
and calm everybody down.

229
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,798
We need that power
to get the radio transmitter working.

230
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,367
It's our only chance
of reaching the outside world.

231
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,502
We have to find other survivors.

232
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,675
Yeah. There's not that many of us left.

233
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,442
We can't afford any more casualties.

234
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,318
We founded this place...

235
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,805
- you and I...
- I know,

236
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,995
on the idea that power would lead us back
to the life we once had.

237
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,716
If we can't stick together,
maybe we can't survive.

238
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,303
I lost everything.

239
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:04,797
The idea of losing what little I have is...

240
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,964
I want to go back up there.

241
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,868
Listen to me. Give me three days.

242
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,031
Let me talk to him.
If it doesn't work, then we do it your way.

243
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,514
And what if it backfires?
What if he gets violent?

244
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,376
I mean, how do you know
that he'll even understand you?

245
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,419
He's more than just an ape.

246
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,848
I'm gonna take some men
up to Fort Point.

247
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,891
I'm gonna go through the armory.

248
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,723
I'm gonna see what's still working.

249
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,260
Three days.

250
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,725
You're not back in three days...

251
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:45,327
we're going up there,
and we're gonna kill every last one of them.

252
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,979
Carver is getting the trucks ready.

253
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,888
He'll be here with Foster and Kemp
any minute.

254
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,506
You're really taking Carver?
I mean, he shot one of them.

255
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,926
I don't really have any choice.

256
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,945
He used to work at the water department.
He's the only one who knows how the dam works.

257
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,914
Malcolm...

258
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:23,645
what are you gonna do up there?
What are you gonna say?

259
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,821
I'll tell him the truth.

260
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,825
Hope I catch him in a good mood.

261
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,025
You think I'm crazy.

262
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,866
I'm worried.

263
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,789
Yeah, so am I.

264
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,266
I've gone over it in my head...

265
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,596
and I think if I don't at least try this...

266
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,977
there's gonna be a war.

267
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,329
Take me with you.

268
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,807
What if someone gets hurt?
You'll need me there.

269
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,312
I love you.

270
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,573
But I need you to stay here.

271
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,919
I don't want Alexander to be alone.

272
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,355
I'm coming, too.

273
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,328
Son, it's not safe.

274
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,678
But I'm safer with you
than I am down here.

275
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,365
I'm coming.

276
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,822
Please.

277
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,467
No one gets out of the trucks.

278
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,384
No one.

279
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:24,353
If I'm not back in two hours,
you get everyone back to the city.

280
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,088
It's gonna be okay.

281
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,285
Please. Please. Please.

282
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,181
Please don't kill me.

283
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,703
Just hear what I have to say.

284
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,105
I know.

285
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,093
"Don't come back." I know.

286
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,309
I wouldn't be here unless it were...

287
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,267
Okay! Okay! Okay!

288
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,103
Okay, okay, okay.

289
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,378
I need to show you something.

290
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,653
It's not far.

291
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,228
Human lies!

292
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,715
No! No!

293
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,027
No, no, no. I swear.

294
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,895
If I could just show you,
then you'll understand.

295
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,623
Please.

296
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,565
Show me.

297
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,377
This is what we used to call
a "small hydro."

298
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,314
It was built to service
areas to the north of here...

299
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,648
but we've been working to
reroute the power lines to the city...

300
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,382
because the city used to run off nuclear power,
but that ran out years ago.

301
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,993
So, we've been using
diesel generators and gasifiers.

302
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,892
But if we can just
get this dam working...

303
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,365
then we have a shot
at restoring limited power.

304
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,421
Is any of this making any sense to you?

305
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,425
The... lights.

306
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,323
Yes.

307
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,488
The lights.

308
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,390
This is your home...

309
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,230
and I don't want to take it away from you,
I promise.

310
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:57,966
But if you can let us do our work here...

311
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,996
You brought others?

312
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,747
Just a few.

313
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,538
I'm not a threat.

314
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,152
If I am...

315
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,584
then I guess you can kill me.

316
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,862
Come on!

317
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:45,069
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Stop, stop.

318
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,715
We need to give them our guns.

319
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,922
That's the one condition.

320
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,565
What does that mean?

321
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,363
We can stay.

322
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,309
If they get power, they'll be more dangerous!

323
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,311
Why help them?!

324
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,658
They seem desperate...

325
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,096
If we make them go, they'll attack.

326
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,405
Let them.

327
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,997
We'll destroy them while they're weak.

328
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,036
And how many apes will die?

329
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,632
We have one chance for peace...

330
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,189
Let them do their human work. Then they'll go.

331
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,313
Human work?

332
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,877
Human work.

333
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:07,002
Human work.

334
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,262
Human work!

335
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,010
Koba say...

336
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,373
Apes should hate humans...

337
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,379
Enough!

338
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,033
From humans Koba learned hate...

339
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,967
But nothing else.

340
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,491
Hey.

341
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:13,997
You need to eat.

342
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,693
Okay.

343
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,033
That was brave, what you did today.

344
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,933
Malcolm.

345
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,767
I know everyone's depending on you...

346
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:34,607
I don't care about that.
I don't care about any of that.

347
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,777
I care about him.

348
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:42,960
He saw things that no kid should see,
and I'm not letting us go back to that.

349
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,559
I know.

350
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,964
I have been trying
to get closer to him.

351
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,042
But...

352
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,153
You will.

353
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,887
You know the scary thing about them?

354
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:17,329
They don't need power, lights.

355
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,022
Heat. Nothing.

356
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:21,887
Hey, pal.

357
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,596
That's their advantage.

358
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,055
That's what makes them stronger.

359
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,906
Malcolm, I'm thinking one of us
should stand guard tonight.

360
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,173
With what? They took our guns.

361
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,714
If they wanted us dead,
we would be dead already.

362
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,182
Maybe they're just taking their time.

363
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,953
They killed off half the planet already.

364
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,185
Come on.

365
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,277
What?

366
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,118
You can't honestly blame the apes.

367
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,922
Who the hell else am I going to blame?
It was the Simian Flu.

368
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,896
It was a virus created
by scientists in a lab.

369
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,626
The chimps they were testing on
didn't have a say in the matter.

370
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,530
Spare me the hippie-dippie bullshit.

371
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,854
You're telling me you don't get
sick to your stomach at the sight of them?

372
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,295
Didn't you have a little girl?

373
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,365
Carver, that's enough.

374
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,207
- How did she die?
- That's enough!

375
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,234
Or your wife, for that matter.

376
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,576
Carver, you better shut up...

377
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,584
before I kick your ass.

378
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,148
Okay.

379
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,588
I'm the asshole.

380
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,393
Are you okay?

381
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:48,118
You sound sick... You ok?

382
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,222
Just need rest.

383
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:02,897
You worry about the humans...

384
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,863
Where's Koba?

385
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:08,750
Still angry.

386
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,438
Said he was going hunting...

387
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,110
Look, humans below!

388
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,994
Why are we here?

389
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:41,197
Caesar trusts humans...

390
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,798
Koba does not.

391
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,195
Most of the arsenal seems functional.

392
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:48,139
Good.

393
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,973
We're testing them out back.

394
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,842
Hey!

395
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,113
Don't you move!

396
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,290
Don't move, do you understand me?

397
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,533
Terry!

398
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,359
Terry, get in here, quick!

399
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,129
Holy shit.

400
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,685
What do we do?
What do we do?

401
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,287
Where did he come from?

402
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,537
- Should we shoot him?
- Maybe. I don't know.

403
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,056
You are one ugly son of a bitch,
aren't you?

404
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,033
Whoa, man.

405
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,115
Dude, I think he's hungry.

406
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,590
He must have gotten separated
from the others.

407
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:45,853
You lost?

408
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,929
Trying to get home?

409
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,462
Go on! Get out of here, stupid monkey!

410
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,355
Go on. You heard him. Go!

411
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,703
Enough guns here to kill every ape...

412
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,198
Must warn Caesar.

413
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,516
Who knows what humans
are really doing up there?

414
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,768
We gotta clear this blockage.

415
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,629
I didn't know you had a daughter.

416
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,345
Yeah.

417
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,118
What was her name?

418
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,193
Sarah.

419
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,528
I'm really sorry.

420
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,473
Well, now I have you and your dad, so...

421
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,286
Yeah.

422
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,351
All right, you got that straight?

423
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,036
Whoa.

424
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,178
That's all the wire we got.

425
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,997
Brace yourselves.

426
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:50,313
Three, two, one.

427
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,325
- Dad!
- Malcolm!

428
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,661
Malcolm! Malcolm!

429
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,666
Dad?

430
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:08,655
I can't see Carver.

431
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,689
Don't!

432
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,843
- Leave it there.
- I got it.

433
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,360
It's not broken.

434
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:44,292
Let go. Good.

435
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,766
Thank you.

436
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,779
You saved our lives.

437
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,722
We've got a lot of debris to clear now.

438
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,093
We might need a bit more time.

439
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,913
How long?

440
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,394
Hey, buddy.

441
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,799
Hey... hey...

442
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,575
What are you doing? Are you finished?

443
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,542
What are you looking at?

444
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,725
Hey! Hey!

445
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,563
Hey, get out of there!

446
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,133
- Hey! I'll kill you!
- Carver, what're you doing?

447
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,093
Don't! Don't!

448
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,972
Caesar, no!

449
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,363
No.

450
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:49,423
Said no guns!

451
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,593
- No, don't.
- Please.

452
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,290
I didn't know.

453
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:38,736
Human leave now!

454
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,221
Man, we screwed now.

455
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,230
Malcolm?

456
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,980
Malcolm, where are you going?

457
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:33,999
Malcolm.

458
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:43,023
Please, please,
I just need to speak to him.

459
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:49,348
I'm sorry. That was all my fault.
But I will make him leave.

460
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,574
This my home.

461
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,020
You should not be here.

462
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:57,724
I understand.

463
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,873
Malcolm.

464
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,034
She's sick.

465
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,264
How long has she been this way?

466
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:20,006
I have medicine.

467
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,951
Antibiotics.

468
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,371
Maybe she can help.

469
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:32,612
Do not trust you.

470
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,957
I don't blame you.

471
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,731
But believe me...

472
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,518
we are not all like him.

473
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,229
Please.

474
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,858
Let us help you.

475
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,222
One day.

476
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:22,627
You stay one day.

477
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,989
Father, no...!

478
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,642
- We might need more time.
- One day!

479
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,080
Ape will help.

480
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:40,694
I will not help!

481
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,007
- This is bullshit, man!
- Get him out of here.

482
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,798
Move! That's enough.
Come on, get out of here.

483
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,701
Come on, man.

484
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:57,939
Okay?

485
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,847
Move, come on!

486
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,013
Get in!

487
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,122
See you tomorrow, asshole.

488
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:33,081
Just came from the city. Humans very dangerous!

489
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,504
Where is Caesar?

490
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,143
With the humans...

491
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,863
Yo, Alex.

492
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:52,092
This relay's busted.
See if there's another one.

493
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,223
Yeah.

494
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,611
Caesar.

495
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,253
Hey!

496
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,659
No! No, no, no, don't!

497
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,327
No! No! No!

498
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,960
Where Caesar? Want Caesar.

499
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,102
Caesar!

500
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:02,465
Humans attack your sons.

501
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,541
You let them stay!

502
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,675
Put apes in danger!

503
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,732
Caesar love humans more...

504
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,320
than apes!

505
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:23,974
More than your...

506
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,094
sons.

507
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,598
Ape...

508
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,273
not...

509
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,176
kill...

510
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:20,964
ape.

511
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,337
Forgive me.

512
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,712
You are my son...

513
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,642
I need you to listen...

514
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:47,434
You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?

515
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,720
Neither will you.

516
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:08,536
Your father doesn't trust me now.

517
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:12,513
You need to protect him.

518
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,614
His love for humans...

519
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,019
Makes him blind.

520
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,930
I know...

521
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:24,830
As long as they are here...

522
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:30,701
I fear for Caesar's life.

523
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,155
For yesterday.

524
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,953
Look. Look.

525
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,103
Watch.

526
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,289
Watch.

527
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,190
"It was Friday."

528
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,315
"A real nice afternoon."

529
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,548
"Warm."

530
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,998
"We were hanging..."

531
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,140
"We were hanging out..."

532
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:11,064
"at this kegger down
at the swimming hole."

533
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,978
Hanging out.

534
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,420
Hanging.

535
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,890
Here. You can read?

536
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,082
Now, this is the good stuff.

537
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,699
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

538
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:51,209
What the hell is wrong with you?
I thought we told you to go home!

539
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,154
No!

540
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,836
No! Go!

541
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,755
- He understood that, didn't he?
- Yeah.

542
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,760
Hey, hey, hey!

543
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,423
Hey, hey.

544
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:10,687
Hey.

545
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:13,865
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

546
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,944
I think he likes you.

547
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,547
Shut up.

548
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,444
All right, all right.

549
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,352
You want a drink, fugly?

550
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,580
Go on, give him some.

551
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,180
Give him some, man.
See what happens.

552
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:33,923
There you go.

553
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,859
Whoa, hey!

554
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,758
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

555
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,081
Shit!

556
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,134
That's good, huh?

557
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:51,812
Hey, hey, hey!

558
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,709
Okay. All right.

559
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:55,765
Easy.

560
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:56,634
Yeah.

561
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:57,945
- Easy.
- Easy.

562
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,098
All right...

563
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,598
Malcolm!

564
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:50,932
Malcolm!

565
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,621
What is it? What happened?

566
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:32,688
It worked.

567
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,629
At least here it did.

568
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,631
We'll know when
we get back to the city.

569
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,637
Trust.

570
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,332
Son of a bitch.

571
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,604
You son of a bitch!

572
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:06,120
The... lights.

573
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,780
Feeling better?

574
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,686
Mother...?

575
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,544
Human gun!

576
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,214
Run.

577
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:53,193
Humans kill Caesar!

578
01:12:57,906 --> 01:12:59,874
Burn ape home!

579
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,741
Go! Get them!

580
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,875
Apes must attack human city!

581
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,720
Fight back!

582
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:24,883
Come, fight for Caesar!

583
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,853
Females and young stay in woods...

584
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,454
We go to the city!

585
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,276
We will avenge your father's death!

586
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,292
Ellie! Ellie.

587
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:51,934
This is San Francisco
attempting contact.

588
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,331
If anyone is receiving this message...

589
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:57,599
we ask that you identify yourself
and your location. Over.

590
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,613
Move, move!

591
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:29,840
If you are receiving this signal,
please state your location. Over.

592
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:33,886
Repeat. This is San Francisco
attempting to establish contact.

593
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:35,148
If you are receiving this signal...

594
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:38,043
please state your identity
and your location. Over.

595
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:40,458
What is it?

596
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:41,989
The apes attacked the armory, sir.

597
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,715
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

598
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:26,762
Keep them off the walls!
Keep them off the walls!

599
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,595
Let's go! Get into position.

600
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,170
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

601
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:39,684
Good.

602
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,006
Listen to me.

603
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:45,784
We are survivors!

604
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,259
Now, they may have got their hands
on some of our guns...

605
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,694
but that does not make them men.

606
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,195
<i>They are animals!</i>

607
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:54,460
<i>We will push them back!</i>

608
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,133
<i>Drive them down!</i>

609
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:01,207
And they will not
get through these doors!

610
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,762
There! California Street!

611
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,405
Bring me the rocket launcher!

612
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:44,870
We have a beacon marking our location.

613
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,119
Please, we need help.
We are under attack.

614
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,842
<i>San Francisco. Repeat.</i>

615
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,678
Hello?

616
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,229
<i>Do you copy?</i>

617
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:20,460
Humans escaping! Capture them!

618
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,982
We must be getting close.

619
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,344
I think I see it. It's down here!

620
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,617
Dad!

621
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:17,204
Oh, my God. Malcolm!

622
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:18,818
Ellie, help me.

623
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,331
My...

624
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:35,328
son...

625
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,721
My...

626
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:42,103
family...

627
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:47,946
Where?

628
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:54,566
I don't know.

629
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,916
Try not to speak. You need to rest.

630
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,726
Hold.

631
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,648
He's lost a lot of blood.

632
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:31,439
Is he going to make it?

633
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,516
I don't understand.

634
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:36,791
Where did Carver get the gun?

635
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,088
Why would he do this?

636
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,427
Ape...

637
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,154
What?

638
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,664
Ape...

639
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,757
did...

640
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,141
this.

641
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:03,344
Get in the truck.

642
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,464
Followed the humans here. Hiding everywhere!

643
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:29,562
We must catch them all!

644
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:49,502
Kill him.

645
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:50,649
No, no, no.

646
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:58,428
Go ahead Ash...

647
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,667
...make humans pay.

648
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:08,485
Caesar wouldn't want this.

649
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:49,944
Caesar gone...

650
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:57,683
Apes follow...

651
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,862
Koba now.

652
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:24,280
Oh, my God.
Look, the colony's on fire.

653
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,399
Where are we going to go?

654
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:28,421
Caesar, what?

655
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:38,923
Is this it?
Are we close?

656
01:28:39,247 --> 01:28:40,578
Where is he taking us?

657
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:44,437
Malcolm, stop!

658
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:56,159
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

659
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,252
It doesn't matter.

660
01:28:57,432 --> 01:29:00,392
We just need a place to hide him
until we find out what's going on at home.

661
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,486
Go move the table.

662
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:12,633
Okay. Right here.

663
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:14,736
Okay.

664
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:20,417
Dad, look.

665
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,650
Look.

666
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,696
We need to operate.
I don't have anything.

667
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,449
There's a surgical kit
back at the place, but that's...

668
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:35,647
I'll go.

669
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:38,892
It's not safe.

670
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:42,008
He's the only one that can stop this.

671
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:46,174
Humans!

672
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:50,075
You ape prisoner now!

673
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:54,085
You will know life in cage.

674
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:57,769
More humans out there.

675
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:01,074
Go! Find them!

676
01:30:20,448 --> 01:30:22,416
Maurice...?

677
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:25,085
Koba said...

678
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,688
...we're too loyal to your father.

679
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:34,820
Protect yourself.

680
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:55,667
Shit!

681
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,404
Hey, wait.

682
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:10,272
Your father.

683
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:15,066
He's alive.

684
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:28,322
I got it.

685
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:30,053
How is he?

686
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:57,749
Your... mother.

687
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:01,632
Brother.

688
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:04,134
Safe?

689
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,566
For now.

690
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:17,129
No.

691
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:18,677
No.

692
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:24,346
Not human.

693
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:30,176
Koba.

694
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:35,023
Malcolm.

695
01:34:35,803 --> 01:34:37,236
Yeah.

696
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:40,237
Caesar.

697
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:44,025
We need to do this now.

698
01:34:48,049 --> 01:34:49,539
Son.

699
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:26,012
How is he?

700
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:29,836
We'll see.

701
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:33,337
He's very strong.

702
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,749
It's gonna be okay.

703
01:36:18,005 --> 01:36:20,064
I'm so sorry...

704
01:36:20,975 --> 01:36:22,556
For everything.

705
01:36:24,145 --> 01:36:25,635
No.

706
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,145
I...

707
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:32,850
am to blame.

708
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:37,506
But Koba betrayed you.

709
01:36:37,892 --> 01:36:39,143
I...

710
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:42,955
chose to trust him...

711
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:47,681
because he is ape.

712
01:36:48,903 --> 01:36:51,235
I always think...

713
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:55,674
ape better than human.

714
01:36:57,978 --> 01:37:00,071
I see now...

715
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:06,206
how much like them we are.

716
01:37:10,758 --> 01:37:13,090
Where Koba now?

717
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:17,293
On the human tower...

718
01:37:18,465 --> 01:37:20,581
Loyal apes around him.

719
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:24,192
And those who not follow?

720
01:37:24,738 --> 01:37:26,626
Prisoners.

721
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:29,340
Maurice.

722
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,409
Rocket.

723
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,981
Koba killed Ash.

724
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:46,484
Fear makes others follow.

725
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:50,792
But when they see you alive...

726
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:55,335
They will turn from Koba.

727
01:37:55,469 --> 01:37:57,232
Not if I am weak.

728
01:38:00,107 --> 01:38:04,396
Ape always seek strongest branch.

729
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:11,473
I must do something to stop him.

730
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:23,324
Father.

731
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,925
Let me help you.

732
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:23,180
Please, let us out of here!

733
01:41:42,896 --> 01:41:43,874
<i>Okay.</i>

734
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,918
<i>Caesar, look.</i>

735
01:41:46,867 --> 01:41:48,050
<i>Apple.</i>

736
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:49,827
<i>Apple.</i>

737
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:52,158
<i>Good.</i>

738
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,166
<i>Home.</i>

739
01:41:54,908 --> 01:41:56,273
<i>Home.</i>

740
01:41:58,412 --> 01:41:59,777
<i>Home.</i>

741
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:02,607
<i>Yes.</i>

742
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:06,406
<i>This is your home.</i>

743
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,376
<i>Your home.</i>

744
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,611
<i>Good. Good.</i>

745
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:15,174
<i>That's good.</i>

746
01:42:38,285 --> 01:42:39,775
Sorry.

747
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:42,069
I didn't mean to intrude.

748
01:42:46,093 --> 01:42:48,459
It's been two days.

749
01:42:54,535 --> 01:42:56,685
Your son is not back yet?

750
01:43:01,708 --> 01:43:03,676
Who was that?

751
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:06,693
On the video.

752
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:12,805
A good man.

753
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:18,021
Like you.

754
01:43:48,855 --> 01:43:50,775
They need to get to the tower
without being seen.

755
01:43:50,857 --> 01:43:52,791
I'm gonna take him through the subway.

756
01:43:53,594 --> 01:43:54,720
I love you.

757
01:43:55,295 --> 01:43:58,526
Koba sent for the females and young.

758
01:43:58,732 --> 01:44:01,246
They're on their way.

759
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:03,035
Mother too.

760
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:06,656
Must go. Now!

761
01:44:17,985 --> 01:44:19,145
Are you okay?

762
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:31,294
Who's there?

763
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:34,229
If you're human, you better say so!

764
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:36,221
It's me! It's Malcolm!

765
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:37,654
Don't shoot!

766
01:44:39,773 --> 01:44:40,990
Take the stairs.

767
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:43,334
They'll bring you around and
up under the street, okay?

768
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:44,489
Go.

769
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:49,570
Thank you.

770
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:52,170
Trust.

771
01:44:59,259 --> 01:45:01,147
All right, I'm coming out!

772
01:45:01,328 --> 01:45:03,023
Don't shoot!

773
01:45:20,847 --> 01:45:22,098
Hey!

774
01:45:22,282 --> 01:45:23,681
Look who I found.

775
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:25,943
I didn't know if you'd made it out.

776
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:27,131
Good to see you.

777
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:28,754
Don't worry.

778
01:45:28,922 --> 01:45:30,446
We're gonna turn all this around.

779
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,410
What do you mean? What's going on?

780
01:45:32,592 --> 01:45:34,287
The apes. They're all over the tower.

781
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:36,190
I lost the signal. It dropped out.

782
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:37,318
Keep trying.

783
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:38,987
Malcolm, look at this.

784
01:45:40,367 --> 01:45:43,632
C-4. Five-pound blocks.

785
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,364
We just started setting them.

786
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,997
They're gonna take down the whole tower.

787
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:53,543
Blast them all at once.

788
01:45:54,147 --> 01:45:56,035
We could use your help.

789
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:37,853
This is San Francisco attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

790
01:46:38,024 --> 01:46:41,084
we ask that you identify yourself and
your location. Over.

791
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:46,984
Here.
Come on.

792
01:46:47,167 --> 01:46:49,727
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

793
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:51,599
and your location. Over.

794
01:47:00,046 --> 01:47:01,206
This is San Francisco...

795
01:47:01,381 --> 01:47:03,599
attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

796
01:47:03,784 --> 01:47:06,685
we ask that you identify yourself
and your location.

797
01:47:09,222 --> 01:47:11,190
- Hey.
- Hey.

798
01:47:18,532 --> 01:47:21,285
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

799
01:47:21,468 --> 01:47:22,753
and your location. Over.

800
01:47:27,474 --> 01:47:28,566
Dreyfus.

801
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:34,235
- Can anybody hear me?
- Werner.

802
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:40,552
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do this.

803
01:47:41,822 --> 01:47:43,642
We need to give him a chance.

804
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:46,592
We need to give him some time.

805
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:48,989
He's up there right now.

806
01:47:51,598 --> 01:47:53,418
Who's up there?

807
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:35,794
Caesar has no place here.

808
01:48:37,777 --> 01:48:39,802
Apes follow...

809
01:48:40,914 --> 01:48:42,575
Koba now.

810
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:48,643
Follow Koba...

811
01:48:49,623 --> 01:48:50,635
to war.

812
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:53,505
Apes win war!

813
01:48:55,161 --> 01:48:58,460
Apes together strong!

814
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:05,036
Caesar...

815
01:49:06,506 --> 01:49:07,837
weak.

816
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:14,705
Koba weaker.

817
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:06,578
Are you out of your fucking mind?

818
01:50:07,367 --> 01:50:10,359
No, I've seen things.
I've seen the way they are.

819
01:50:11,204 --> 01:50:13,058
They want what we want, to survive.

820
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:14,331
They don't want a war.

821
01:50:14,507 --> 01:50:16,031
They're animals!

822
01:50:16,209 --> 01:50:17,426
They attacked us!

823
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:20,273
Because they thought we attacked them.
They think that he's dead, but he's not...

824
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:21,994
Sit down, Finney!

825
01:50:22,782 --> 01:50:24,215
Sit down!

826
01:50:47,574 --> 01:50:49,633
Trusted Koba like brother.

827
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:53,275
Caesar brother to human!

828
01:50:55,749 --> 01:50:58,411
Koba fight for ape!

829
01:50:58,752 --> 01:51:00,481
Free ape!

830
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:04,307
Kill ape.

831
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:06,072
Koba fight for Koba.

832
01:51:14,934 --> 01:51:16,265
Koba...

833
01:51:16,803 --> 01:51:20,489
belong in cage.

834
01:52:08,621 --> 01:52:10,600
I know how this must sound.

835
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:11,950
I don't think you have any...

836
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:19,555
Do you think stopping me will matter?

837
01:52:20,166 --> 01:52:21,827
They're coming.

838
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:25,391
Now, we made contact with a
military base up north.

839
01:52:26,372 --> 01:52:28,886
They're already on their way!

840
01:52:29,709 --> 01:52:30,835
It's true.

841
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:36,511
Dreyfus!

842
01:52:36,683 --> 01:52:38,139
What are you doing, man?

843
01:52:48,328 --> 01:52:50,148
I'm saving the human race.

844
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:51,160
No!

845
01:55:12,672 --> 01:55:13,855
Ape...

846
01:55:14,707 --> 01:55:16,675
not kill...

847
01:55:17,543 --> 01:55:18,828
ape.

848
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:46,554
You are...

849
01:55:48,374 --> 01:55:50,160
not ape.

850
01:55:54,047 --> 01:55:55,594
No!

851
01:57:09,956 --> 01:57:11,412
Leave him!

852
01:57:29,308 --> 01:57:31,003
You're not safe here.

853
01:57:31,644 --> 01:57:34,340
They made contact.
Other people are coming. Soldiers.

854
01:57:34,914 --> 01:57:36,939
You have to leave now. Everyone.

855
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:41,511
If you don't go,
it'll be all-out war.

856
01:57:41,687 --> 01:57:43,302
War...

857
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:45,582
has already...

858
01:57:46,692 --> 01:57:47,818
begun.

859
01:57:49,796 --> 01:57:52,549
Ape started war.

860
01:57:55,701 --> 01:57:57,396
And human...

861
01:57:59,806 --> 01:58:02,866
Human will not forgive.

862
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:09,833
You must go...

863
01:58:10,183 --> 01:58:13,869
before fighting begins.

864
01:58:15,721 --> 01:58:17,484
I am sorry...

865
01:58:19,992 --> 01:58:22,927
my friend.

866
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:30,567
I thought we had a chance.

867
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:36,568
I did, too.

868
01:58:37,305 --> 01:59:37,232
