1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,227
You move over.

2
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,605
Hey, this is Luke. This is my film.
Let me ask you a couple of questions.

3
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,274
Why do you dance?

4
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,943
Because it's like breathing,
it's like walking to me.

5
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,070
I'm not pretending.
When I dance I don't pretend.

6
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,240
I'm more myself when I dance
than any other moment of the day.

7
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,493
I dance to become someone else.

8
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,997
There are so many things in this world
that want to push down on you,

9
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,373
but when you dance you are free.

10
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,961
We started dancing at the age of seven
in our house, in the living room.

11
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,964
Just dancing, dancing,
copying Michael Jackson.

12
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,633
And I'm just like listening to the music
in the grocery store,

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,969
just like dancing through the aisles
and stuff like that,

14
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,096
and she's like,
"Contain yourself, calm down. "

15
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,932
And I'm like, "I can't stop,
I have to do it, I have to do it. "

16
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:44,437
After everybody went to sleep I would
open the garage and just practise.

17
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,316
That's pretty much when I knew
I loved it because I had never dedicated

18
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,610
so much time and effort
into something like that.

19
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,237
It's not us just jumping around.
Dance has vocabulary.

20
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,822
- Inglewood.
- I'm from Argentina.

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,032
I'm from northern Uganda.

22
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,700
- Miami, Florida.
- Koreatown, Los Angeles.

23
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,327
There's a lot of gangs and violence.

24
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,787
I couldn't be stuck there all my life.

25
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:01,746
My village was attacked.

26
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,581
My parents didn't even want me
around any more.

27
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,041
She actually kicked me out of the house.

28
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,876
- I had to go.
- Dance saved me.

29
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,419
Dance definitely saved me.

30
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,797
If it wasn't for dance,
I don't know what we'd be doing right now.

31
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,173
I didn't have anything,
I didn't have money.

32
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,259
I was living with $15 a week
in New York City.

33
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,179
Dance brought us together too,
all around the world. We're here.

34
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,181
Truth is everybody is a dancer inside.

35
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,307
We all have a heartbeat.

36
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,976
We all have a rhythm inside.
Boom-boom, boom-boom.

37
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,896
- What's that one thing you say?
- Yeah, what do you call us?

38
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,564
- Born from a boombox?
- Yes.

39
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,275
- Born from a boombox.
- That's pretty good.

40
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,485
Born from a boombox.

41
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,238
It sounds stupid,
but I do feeI like that.

42
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,906
And if we listen hard enough,

43
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,409
we realise that maybe we're all
plugged into the same song.

44
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,261
New York University freshmen,
welcome to Washington Square Park.

45
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,473
It's the central hub of our urban campus,
and to the right...

46
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,565
Mom? Dad? You guys can really go.

47
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,775
No! We're gonna take you
and Camille out for dinner.

48
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,443
We promised her parents we'd feed her.

49
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,404
We're already paying for our meal plans.
It's all good.

50
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,072
Yeah, we're fine, we really are, Mrs A.

51
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,866
- We should go.
- All right. One last picture.

52
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,200
OK. One last picture.

53
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,911
Get together, you're best friends,
you could drive a truck through you.

54
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,789
- We're close.
- Get closer! Put your arm around her.

55
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,332
- OK.
- Good boy.

56
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,668
All right. Ready? Say, "Mom is pretty. "

57
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,628
- Mom is pretty.
- Thank you.

58
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,297
Ready? And... Oop.

59
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:38,092
Oh. Look at this. Picture of a hat.
I got a hat with hair.

60
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,346
If my father could see me now saying
goodbye to my son, a future engineer...

61
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,224
I'm just so happy you're done
with that dance business, I can't tell you.

62
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,517
Oh, but you have...

63
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,645
- OK, all right. You make me proud.
- OK. This is it.

64
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,314
Could I get in your backpack? Come on.

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,774
- That's too tight. OK. All right.
- Come on.

66
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,902
I'll make you proud
if I could just go to orientation.

67
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,237
- No! You're my baby.
- Everybody left already.

68
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,948
- All right. OK.
- I'll call you when I get to the dorm.

69
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,034
- Wear deodorant, deodorant. Every day.
- Come on.

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,619
- OK, honey? It's important.
- Come on, honey.

71
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,746
- Cos you're a man now.
- Honey, we got to beat the traffic.

72
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,955
All right.

73
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,125
- Wow! They really...
- Are embarrassing.

74
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,836
- I was gonna say "love you".
- Sorry.

75
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,089
Hey, Cam, check those out.

76
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,134
Those are the limited edition
gunmetal Nike Dunks.

77
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,181
Uh-oh. I know that look. OK, Moose,
seriously, next on the tour, Union Square.

78
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:29,060
I just wanna get a closer look.
I'm gonna be right back. OK? Cover me.

79
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,645
I guess.

80
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,618
All right, let's go, who you got?

81
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,246
- I want 25 on Kid Darkness.
- 25 on Darkness, let's go, let's go.

82
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,920
- Give my money.
- Sorry, guy, I got you.

83
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,297
Oh, snap! Did you see that?

84
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,843
Yo, I want ten on the skinny kid.

85
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,639
Give me 20.

86
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,183
Give me that 20.

87
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,066
Yo, you see that?

88
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,567
Oh, whoo-hoo-hoo!

89
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,529
It's over, it's over, that's it!

90
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,406
Go home! Go home!

91
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,367
Come on, new kid, get in there!

92
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,995
Come on, let's see what you got.

93
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,288
I think we're done here.

94
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,999
He ain't got no flava.

95
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,835
- Yo, look at the kid!
- He moves pretty good for a geek.

96
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,629
Buddy, that kid is real!
Been holding out!

97
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,465
I didn't know that dude
could dance like that.

98
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,718
Let's go, new kid,
let's see what you got.

99
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,345
Hey, you give me five on that.
Give me five on that.

100
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,853
Let's go, Darkness!

101
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:04,947
Oh!

102
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,382
Buddy, that kid is real!

103
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,438
Oh!

104
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,779
Who's gonna pay for my balloons?
Hey, he's right here!

105
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,282
- Get this guy.
- Stop! Police! Hold it right there!

106
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,243
Come on, man. They're after you.
Go. Come on!

107
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,789
Come on, kid.

108
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,252
Come on, let's go.

109
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,879
All right, man, time-out. I can't.

110
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,881
We don't have time for that. Come on!

111
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,217
- Police!
- Get out of the way!

112
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,637
What are you doing? What are you doing?

113
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,430
Jump first, fear later.

114
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,518
Whoa.

115
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,104
- Get out of the way!
- Come on, come on!

116
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,980
Excuse me!

117
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,108
Out of the way! Out of the way, folks.

118
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,321
Oh. Ah.

119
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,617
My ribcage. I feel like
I just threw up in my mouth.

120
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,869
It's burning.

121
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,205
Where are you going?

122
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,581
Yo.

123
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,376
How did you just do that back there?

124
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,754
I mean, you were like freaking flying, man.
You're like a ninja.

125
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,090
- Luke.
- No, it's like this. You gotta blow it up.

126
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,261
Ah, come on.

127
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,264
How's that?

128
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,473
All right.

129
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,017
I'm Robert Alexander the Third,
by the way.

130
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,062
Just since you ask.

131
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,856
But you can just call me Moose.

132
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,650
- I haven't seen you around.
- I'm just starting at NYU.

133
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,319
- I'm actually an engineering major.
- But you're gonna be dancing too.

134
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,821
No, no, no, not any more.

135
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,283
I mean, dancing was cool in high school,
but it's time for me to face the real world.

136
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,828
You really have no idea
what you did back there, do you?

137
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,455
- You're B-FAB.
- What's a B-FAB?

138
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,499
Born from a boombox.

139
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,878
Like, some people learn to dance,
others are born to.

140
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,630
And you're in New York City,
the dance centre of the world.

141
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,216
Check this.

142
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,888
It's the biggest battle ever.
There's never been this kind of prize money.

143
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,223
And those guys in the park,
they're gearing up for this.

144
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,143
You're good enough.
You should be in this.

145
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,898
This your car?

146
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,901
Oh, my God, that's so sick!

147
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,903
Get in.

148
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,822
What you saw in the park today
is just the beginning.

149
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,712
This is it.

150
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,800
- What the heck is this place?
- Come on.

151
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,221
Welcome to my house.
The House of Pirates.

152
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,352
Nice place. It's a little small to live in.

153
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,482
My parents converted this place years ago.

154
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,194
We all live and train upstairs and run a club
downstairs to make ends meet.

155
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,864
Kinda like a secret hideout.
Right, this is it.

156
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,827
We call this the Vault.

157
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,962
Around here, dance is your identity.

158
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,756
We live together, work together,
battle together.

159
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,801
But unlike other crews,
we all have different styles.

160
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,847
I found all these guys out in the city.
Crazy talent but no place to go.

161
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,558
We've become kind of a pseudo family here

162
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,685
where we can be ourselves
and rules don't apply.

163
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,980
This place is off the chain.

164
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,066
Thing 1 and Thing 2 over there,
that's the Santiago twins.

165
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,403
You, man, you... We saw you dancing
at the park this morning. You were...

166
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,613
- Amazing!
- You are from another planet.

167
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,242
- Your own planet! You're amazing, man.
- I have a question...

168
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,579
No, no, no, guys. Come on. No questions.
I gotta show him around.

169
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,581
Got it! Come on.

170
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,665
You're great!

171
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,751
- Luke.
- Jacob!

172
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,502
What's up, brother?

173
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,880
- Meet Moose.
- Pleased to meet you, Moose.

174
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,299
This guy right here,
he's the captain of the ship.

175
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:19,261
More like the first mate. I heard you did
some impressive work in the park today.

176
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,596
How does everybody know that?

177
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,390
News travels fast when you beat someone
like Kid Darkness.

178
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,393
But, Luke, I need to borrow you
for one second. We've got some things...

179
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,937
- Can we wait? I've got to show him around.
- We'll take him.

180
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,147
Let us show him around.

181
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,024
- I don't know about that, guys.
- Please!

182
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,026
- Please. What would Jesus do?
- Come on.

183
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,528
- All right. Don't hurt him, all right?
- Promise.

184
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,864
Moose, this is the Ticks. Good luck.

185
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,744
This came from the bank today.

186
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,579
We're six months late on our payments.

187
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,165
- We paid them last month.
- What about the other five?

188
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,626
We're working on it.
The club's not making the money it used to.

189
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,087
The bank doesn't want to hear that.

190
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,590
If they don't get the money they're going
to put the Vault up for public auction.

191
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,093
Listen, don't I always have a plan?

192
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,971
This kid, Moose, he beat Kid Darkness
today, and he did it with style.

193
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,766
With a little bit of training,
he could be the spark that we need

194
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,353
to win the hundred grand from
the World Jam and pay back what we owe.

195
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,982
Jacob, we're not gonna lose the Vault,
all right? We won't let that happen.

196
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,403
You don't understand. Nobody ever
smoked Kid Darkness and got it on tape.

197
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,029
Whoo!

198
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,073
- That was serious.
- You're the man.

199
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,200
You think the Samurais
are gonna let you go like that?

200
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,577
They'll find you and they'll batter you again.

201
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,579
- Sam who?
- The House of Samurai.

202
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,456
The most cut-throat house in the city.

203
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,333
- Our fiercest rival.
- Yeah.

204
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,835
They're gonna find me?

205
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,004
They got technology out there,
like the bears with a little GPS inside.

206
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,340
Watch out, they're right behind you!

207
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,009
Come on, that's enough.
Don't let them freak you out.

208
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,637
- You're with us now.
- And nobody messes with us.

209
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,306
- Not even the Samurai.
- Not unless you want to get roasted!

210
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,895
Unless they want to get
a big patata in their traste!

211
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,277
- What?
- OK, you don't get it

212
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,654
but I know what I'm saying.

213
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,950
You got it.

214
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,870
- That's not boring.
- Losers.

215
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,668
She's back.
The one I've been telling you about.

216
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,839
Hey, Moose. Come on,
I'll show you round the club downstairs.

217
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,134
- Party pooper!
- Come on, Luke.

218
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,636
Come on, this way.

219
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,146
Oh!

220
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,773
What? What?

221
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,109
Watch out, they bite.

222
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,869
Crazy, right? Hang out, take a look around.
I'll be back in a second.

223
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,830
Nobody battles the Samurai just once.

224
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,084
Now it's time for the real battle.

225
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,880
Come on, now, you scared?

226
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,007
Come here, man.

227
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,561
Where do you think you're goin'?
This ain't over yet.

228
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,650
Get him, Baba, get him.

229
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,904
Ow!

230
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,572
Go get the kid!

231
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,867
I just want a few rounds with the kid.
We got some unfinished business.

232
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,286
You wanna get to him,
you gotta go through us.

233
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,915
Come on, Luke. Be a good sport.

234
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,459
- What are you doing here, Julien?
- Nice to see you, too.

235
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,503
Get your boys and get off our property.

236
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,923
Your property? It's not gonna be
your property for much longer.

237
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,843
And don't worry. When I buy this place,
I'll take good care of it.

238
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,555
When we win the World Jam, you and your
trust fund won't be able to touch us.

239
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,682
Whoa.

240
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,271
That's cute.
Your boy can't even finish his battles.

241
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,606
Bubbles and balloons? That's so amateur.

242
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,067
Enough, man. He will finish it
at the World Jam and so will we.

243
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,861
I don't even know what you just said.

244
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,321
Yo, man, stop being disrespectful
to my crew, yo.

245
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,580
Get off!

246
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,373
Hey.

247
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,211
Come on, I'll get you out of here.
Get off her, man.

248
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,092
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

249
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,012
Thank you.

250
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,639
I'm Luke.

251
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,184
I'm Natalie.

252
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,770
So, what's with the bags?

253
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:29,399
Oh. I'm supposed to be meeting my friend
here but I guess she's a no-show.

254
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,985
Well, what are you gonna do?

255
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,196
I don't know, I haven't figured that out yet.

256
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,281
You could stay here.

257
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,911
- What, in the club?
- No, I mean upstairs, in the living room.

258
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,248
You don't even know me.

259
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,211
Yeah, I do. Your name's Natalie
and you need a place to sleep.

260
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,050
OK. Sure, thank you.

261
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,219
OK. Grab your stuff.

262
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,817
Are you sure they won't mind?

263
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,945
Everyone here knows what it's like
to be a nomad.

264
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,699
- So where are you from?
- Here.

265
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,910
But I've been living in London
the last few years.

266
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,119
Wow.

267
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,498
Well, this place'll be a departure.

268
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,041
Thank you.

269
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,960
You're welcome.

270
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,881
So, are you ready?

271
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,174
For bed?

272
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,303
No, for the battle. The World Jam?
We could really use someone like you.

273
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,015
- Are you up for a little competition?
- It's what I live for.

274
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,476
- Been competing my whole life.
- Do you win?

275
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,978
I never lose.

276
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,813
Good.

277
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,193
I'll see you in the morning.
We have a lot of work to do.

278
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,623
Moose. Where were you yesterday?
I thought we had plans.

279
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,001
- I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

280
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:15,088
I had to eat dinner with my freakazoid
roommate who smells so badly.

281
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,508
And she would not stop yammering
about her pet rat's blog.

282
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,927
We should hook our roommates
up together.

283
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,805
Mine looks like a pet rat.
He's got the nose and everything,

284
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,933
he's got, like, the claws. Ugh!

285
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,394
Oh. There you go!

286
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,771
Now I need you to help me find
this engineering lab.

287
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,065
- Moose.
- What?

288
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,280
- What would I do without you?
- I don't know. I really don't.

289
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,286
Later, gator.

290
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,325
I see you've found the speaker room.

291
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,661
Yeah.

292
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,164
I built this myself when we could actually
find boomboxes in the city.

293
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,249
Impressive.

294
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,752
- You're up early.
- Already warmed up.

295
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:40,048
Good. Cos you're my new recruit.
It's my responsibility to get you up to speed.

296
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,677
- Then let's train.
- No, no, no. We're not training here.

297
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,095
OK. Then where?

298
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,888
Out there.

299
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,474
Just try to keep up.

300
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,618
Before we divide up into lab groups
and begin the work, though,

301
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,789
I wanna talk to you about,
well, what engineering means to me.

302
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,457
What's your name?

303
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,835
And what hopefully engineering
will mean to you.

304
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,129
Silence, that's my name.

305
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,090
- Silence during class.
- Second of all...

306
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,065
Go answer it, Mr Popular.

307
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,077
What?

308
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,457
Open up the cages, boys. Show these
newbies why we call this the Vault.

309
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,417
OK.
Hey.

310
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,919
Moose boy. How are you, my friend?

311
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,714
- Oh. What a beautiful senorita.
- Por favor.

312
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,049
Nice to meet you.

313
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,260
Can I give you two?

314
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,303
Come on.

315
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,555
- You gonna get mad at me?
- I'm not gonna get mad at you.

316
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,557
I'm just saying hi to her, man.

317
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,934
- I'm introducing myself.
- No, no, no.

318
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,188
You stopped me when I'm introducing
myself to this beautiful...

319
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,523
- Don't listen to him. Don't listen.
- You are so cute.

320
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,734
OK.

321
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:28,031
Ladies and gentlemen,
our most prized possessions.

322
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,790
Check it out.

323
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,585
If dance is our weapon,
then this is our armour.

324
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,879
These are the most beautiful shoes
in the world.

325
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:46,716
- The way they smell, the way they fit.
- You're sounding like a girl, man.

326
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,510
You're like, "I love the shoes. "

327
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:52,305
You gotta say, "I love the shoes,"
like a macho man. OK, bro.

328
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,058
Luke's lucky shoes? Smart boy.

329
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,812
OK, Moose, don't get too attached,
you gotta earn your kicks in this house.

330
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,899
And beyond door number two,
the Graffiti room.

331
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:03,942
Oh, what?

332
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,402
- Who's that guy?
- That? That's Jason.

333
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:10,657
He's our graffiti guru. I'm talking
electronic billboard hacks, LED lights,

334
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:11,991
anything to mark who we are.

335
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:16,246
Dudes! Excellent timing. I have been
working on a portable light tagging system

336
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,957
and I can't figure out how to get it to stick
to 12V batteries...

337
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,876
- You got any electrical tape?
- Yeah, there you go.

338
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,171
Tape it right there, wrap it round
and it creates a snug fit.

339
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,382
- You know lights?
- Yeah, I dabble.

340
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,467
Check it out.

341
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,596
You... Yes! Yes! I love this kid!

342
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,224
Fix the LED to the battery to the magnet.

343
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,144
They're beautiful.
Like neon fireflies.

344
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,980
- Neoflies.
- Yeah, neoflies.

345
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,940
Neoflies. I like it.

346
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,527
Cool. Check it out.

347
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,446
Yeah, we could do something with this.

348
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,366
Neoflies.

349
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,536
Listen up. World Jam
is right around the corner,

350
00:24:56,662 --> 00:25:00,081
but to get there, we got to get through
the two qualifying rounds, which means...

351
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,126
Which means
we got a lot of work cut out for us.

352
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,503
Moose, Natalie. Are you guys in?

353
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,674
Erm...

354
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,843
I don't know,
I mean, I have to go to school...

355
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,386
We'll figure something out.

356
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,306
Pirates... Pirates...

357
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:21,269
Pirates! Pirates! Pirates!

358
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,147
I can do one battle, guys.

359
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,857
All right, all right. Natalie?

360
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,150
House of Pirates!

361
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,527
Go, go, go, go, go.

362
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,619
Owww!

363
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,583
Whoo!

364
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,252
Yeah!

365
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,510
Whoo!

366
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,960
Whoo-hoo!

367
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,024
I'm more of myself when
I dance than any other moment of the day.

368
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,735
I dance to become someone else.

369
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,407
They always think that we are just
a bunch of kids with no direction,

370
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,744
but what we do is very hard.
We make it look easy.

371
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,164
You spin and your equilibrium is off
and you stand up,

372
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,834
and all you have to rely on
is how well you know your body

373
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,630
and you place your two feet on the floor,
finding your horizon within yourself.

374
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,507
- Wow.
- Hey.

375
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,467
- This is quite the setup.
- Thanks.

376
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,761
I collect footage of dancers who inspire me.

377
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,181
Clearly.

378
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,809
What are you gonna do with it all?

379
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,396
I don't know. Nothing.
I just play around with it.

380
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,153
Check this out... Check...

381
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,197
Check-check...

382
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,615
I dance... dance...

383
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,534
.. become someone else.

384
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,244
We were born...

385
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,037
b- b-born from a boombox.

386
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,082
- I had no idea.
- They're amazing, aren't they?

387
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,917
I mean you.

388
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,171
You're a film-maker.

389
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,591
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, I...

390
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,427
usually don't show people this stuff.

391
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,513
It's just me.

392
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,685
All right.

393
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,645
- You're gonna show me?
- Yeah.

394
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,772
OK.

395
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,025
- Promise not to laugh?
- Oh, I promise.

396
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,528
.. or to choose a hobby,
or something like that.

397
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,990
It's another thing for that thing
to choose you.

398
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,784
Jitterbug... Booty shake!

399
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,952
- Yes!
- OK, OK.

400
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,663
This is... This is our teacher in fifth grade.

401
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,790
- Face-lift!
- Yes!

402
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,876
Go. What are you?

403
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,253
- Raptor!
- Yes!

404
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,799
Whoo!

405
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,262
How do you guys even do that?

406
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,848
We can read each other's minds.

407
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,143
Aw, you guys are so cute.
How long have you been dating?

408
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,604
Oh. No, no, no. It's not like that.

409
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,939
We're just... friends.

410
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,232
No.

411
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:22,528
- Correction, everyone. We're best friends.
- Aw.

412
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,072
Anyway, sorry, guys,
I have to go, I'm in a rush.

413
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:28,951
- You're leaving? We just started.
- I'll call you later, though. Have fun.

414
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,453
You guys lost.

415
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,288
Whatever!

416
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,749
Uh... OK...

417
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,543
Gotcha.

418
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,384
Oh, wow. It's so obvious,
it makes so much sense now.

419
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,762
- What?
- You're totally in love with him, aren't you?

420
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,723
- No! No, no, no. It's...
- Yes, yes, yes.

421
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,517
.. not like that, we're just...

422
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:56,562
Like, one of those, we grew up together.
No, that would be really weird.

423
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,731
Um...

424
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,149
I think it's your turn.

425
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,317
- So...
- Me?

426
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,402
Yeah, you're up. You're up.

427
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,907
- OK.
- You go first.

428
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,120
Um... Squirrel. Kangaroo?

429
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,082
Keep trying.

430
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,006
Hey. Look who's up early now.

431
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,385
Actually, I haven't been to sleep yet.

432
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,888
- Can I join you?
- Sure.

433
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,725
- What are you looking at?
- I come out here to listen.

434
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,063
The river, the traffic, the birds.

435
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,234
Make me feel like
I'm part of something bigger.

436
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,280
Traffic makes you feel like
you're a part of something bigger?

437
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,073
That is deep.

438
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,659
Like I said, I've been up all night.

439
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:58,791
So I've been thinking about your video
from last night.

440
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,795
Like, I think you should finish it.
And you should show it to people.

441
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,341
- Yeah, I don't know about that.
- Clearly you love it, right?

442
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,470
Look at you, you've been up all night
and you're like...

443
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,724
I don't know,
you're glowing or something.

444
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,601
Glowing?

445
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,605
I see a glow.

446
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,532
We should get to Red Hook.

447
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,951
You're right.

448
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,090
Welcome to Red Hook!

449
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,427
The first round of World Jam!

450
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,725
Are y'all ready for battle?

451
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,894
Red Hook, are you ready?

452
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,606
Pirates, you ready?

453
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,609
Let's get 'em!

454
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,949
Yaaargh!

455
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,659
Back up.

456
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,328
And the winner is...

457
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,125
the Pirates!

458
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,880
The Pirates are now into the next round

459
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,716
of the World Jam!

460
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,096
Pirates! Pirates! Pirates!

461
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,980
No, no, no.
Yeah. Yeah!

462
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:17,234
Now it's time for you to be in front
of the camera, my good-looking Pirate.

463
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,278
Do you want some make-up, baby?

464
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,492
- So, Captain Luke...
- Gimme the camera.

465
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,287
- No, no, no.
- It's not that easy on this side, huh?

466
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,665
- It's uncomfortable.
- Yeah, why don't you keep walking?

467
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,209
Oh, look at this guy.

468
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,253
What do you love about dance?

469
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:41,508
I don't know. Dance music,
it's just always been there for me, I guess.

470
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,263
Is that it?

471
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,266
What?

472
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,268
I know you can do better than that.

473
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,270
- Come on.
- All right.

474
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,981
My parents used to be dancers.

475
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,026
And they started this place
for people like them,

476
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,820
but that didn't just want to be
backup dancers.

477
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:06,700
You know, do their own thing,
build their own respect.

478
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:11,705
I thought that was cool, so I wanted
to carry on the tradition, in my own way,

479
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,832
but for them, you know?

480
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:19,254
So what do they think of you
turning this place into a madhouse?

481
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,842
They never got to see it.

482
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,475
I'm so sorry.

483
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,103
No, don't be. It's OK.

484
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,481
So that's why you're
so devoted to this place,

485
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,149
carrying on what your parents wanted?

486
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,860
Family is family, you know?

487
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,488
The Vault used to be their life,
and now it's mine.

488
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,367
It's amazing what we do for family
sometimes.

489
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,160
So, tell me about your parents.

490
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,789
They split up a while back.

491
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:58,419
And me and my older brother, we were sort
of the dice that got rolled between them.

492
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,170
Where's your brother now?

493
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,632
We're still close.
I mean, he pretty much raised me.

494
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,218
So I owe him everything.

495
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:14,560
So, Tarantino, are you planning on
blackmailing us with all that footage?

496
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,103
No.

497
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,688
Just you.

498
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,328
Hi. So, I'm sorry for being late, OK?
I won't...

499
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,664
Oh! I'm so sorry.

500
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,083
I thought you were somebody else.
I'm sorry.

501
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,211
OK...

502
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,672
- Do you know that trick when they take...
- Really?

503
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,134
They kinda look alike,
I think they're twins.

504
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,054
Camille! What's going on?
I thought we had lunch.

505
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,680
Is it lunch time?

506
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,098
Whoa! Um...

507
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,435
Wow, we got so carried away
with the costumes, I lost track of time.

508
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,062
Costumes for what?

509
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:02,441
It's for the dorm Halloween party. People
plan their costumes like all semester.

510
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,902
All right. So what are we going to go as?

511
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,195
Oh, um...

512
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,821
Well, actually...

513
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,990
I tried calling you but you didn't pick up,

514
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,786
so Kristin and I are gonna be
the Olsen Twins.

515
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,290
Wait, wait, wait. Kristin?

516
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,335
Kristin?

517
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,545
Camille, Kristin?

518
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,673
What about Moose?

519
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,593
Go ahead, you guys.

520
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,598
You haven't exactly been around lately.

521
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,726
I mean, I couldn't wait forever.

522
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:42,106
OK, well, hey, Camille,
look, I'm here now.

523
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,152
Come on, what do you say?

524
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,489
You know you're gonna have
way more fun with me than...

525
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,740
Kristin.

526
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,536
Are you asking me to the dance?

527
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:04,753
Camillian? You know that I was born
to be the Ashley to your Mary-Kate.

528
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,172
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

529
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,926
OK, OK, fine.

530
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,428
- I'll cancel with Kristin.
- Yes!

531
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,389
I'll see you later.

532
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,891
Guess I'll see you later, then.
Get back to your frie...

533
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:22,062
- Hey, Kristin! In your face!
- Bye.

534
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,940
OK, you gotta stop complaining.
I'm sorry.

535
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:28,068
I just feel ridiculous holding this giant cup.

536
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:32,656
Whoever said it was OK to have a small,
medium, large and then ginormous?

537
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,116
Hey, look.

538
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,371
- That's you.
- What are you talking about?

539
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,582
- This guy looks exactly like you.
- He doesn't.

540
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,751
He's got a camera popping out of his head,
pretty little cheekbones.

541
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:48,380
It does not look like me, and I would not
be caught dead with those culture vultures.

542
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,633
I've seen your work,
and you don't fool me.

543
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,678
Yeah, but it's just for fun.
It's nothing professional.

544
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:58,056
Well, what if the Pirates
and the rivalry didn't exist?

545
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,101
Wouldn't you give your film-making a shot?

546
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,604
That film academy sounds amazing.

547
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,357
Yeah, but it's not an option,
so I don't think about it.

548
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,401
The World Jam's our main focus.

549
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,946
- OK, so, tell me, then, how do you do it?
- Do what?

550
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,365
Get all your amazing footage.

551
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,785
I don't know. I just try to see things
that people don't normally see.

552
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,456
Show me.

553
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,374
All right, come here.

554
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,419
Where are you taking me?

555
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,880
Just trust me. Come on.

556
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,341
- Hurry up.
- All right.

557
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,224
- Just wait for it.
- For what?

558
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,979
- What?
- Watch this.

559
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,529
How did you do that? I'm going to do it.

560
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:55,948
- OK.
- Try it.

561
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,282
OK.

562
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,163
See that? I did it!

563
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,628
There's Slurpee everywhere!

564
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,189
Oh, my God, my straw! I lost my straw!

565
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,903
I think it was just being in my living room,

566
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,116
and me and my brother
were just playing around together,

567
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:24,911
and I always tried to...

568
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,039
.. match him.

569
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:33,128
- Moose.
- Yo. Hey, what time is the battle, again?

570
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:36,340
- Eight o'clock. Why? You ready for it?
- Eight o'clock?

571
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:39,593
It all goes down in Chinatown.
This is the House of Gwai.

572
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,346
They're champions of Asia,
so I hope you're prepared.

573
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:46,516
- We've got a problem.
- No, this is round two. You gotta be there.

574
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,561
We can't have any missing links or we
could get eliminated from the World Jam.

575
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,315
I know, I know.
I have a test on the same exact day.

576
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,775
I don't know if I can...

577
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:59,071
Listen, we need you.
Do whatever you can to make it work.

578
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:08,497
I'm sure I don't need to
remind you how much this test counts.

579
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,583
This is worth 25 per cent of your grade.

580
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,711
Take your time. You may begin.

581
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,468
- Yo, where's Moose at?
- I don't know, man.

582
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,531
Show me something.

583
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,983
I'll go get a towel. I'll be right back.

584
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,446
Where you been, bro?
You just ruined the floor.

585
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:13,199
What? What?

586
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,703
You the man.

587
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,875
.. World Jam!

588
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:29,966
Whoo!

589
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,184
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

590
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,479
- Alone?
- Yeah, hold on.

591
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,361
Yo, hold up. Cut the music.

592
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:50,904
Cut the music.

593
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,031
You guys need to see this.

594
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,083
What is this?
Our entire routine.

595
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,627
It's online?
They know our whole set.

596
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:08,088
- Who would do that?
- Julien and the Samurai.

597
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:11,132
- How could they get our rehearsal footage?
- Does everyone have their DVDs?

598
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,009
- You have the DVD?
- Yeah, I put them in the room.

599
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:17,263
We're still in this, all right?
We just got to figure something out.

600
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,476
OK, see there? If you could just let go
of that spin, we can land this thing.

601
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:25,230
Those guys may have our tapes,
but that won't stop us. Trust me.

602
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:29,651
Luke, I don't know.
Maybe somebody else should do it.

603
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:34,114
If we pull this off, we'll kill it on stage.
Julien won't even know what hit him.

604
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,994
Whatever happened between you two?

605
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:42,038
Me and Julien?

606
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,625
He used to be a Pirate.
We used to be best friends back in the day.

607
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,752
But as time went on, things changed.

608
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,713
How do you mean, they changed?

609
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,464
We found out he had a gambling problem.

610
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,010
He wound up in debt. He bet against our
house and threw the battle to win the bet.

611
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,138
He threw a battle to win a bet?

612
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:02,058
The whole house was devastated,
so we had to kick him out.

613
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,018
He's been trying to take us down
ever since.

614
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:08,148
The crazy thing is, if we don't win
the World Jam he could actually do it.

615
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,815
Hey.

616
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,110
- Welcome home.
- You lied to me.

617
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,989
You told me Luke kicked you out
because he was jealous.

618
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,992
But it wasn't that, was it?
You threw a battle for a bet?

619
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,287
- Natalie...
- Don't! I went in there for you, Julien.

620
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,748
I can't believe you stole that DVD
and put it online.

621
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:09,834
What are you talking about?
What kind of BS did he say about me now?

622
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,338
Luke was jealous. He wanted to be
the leader, so he kicked me out.

623
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,465
He used me and he kicked me out.

624
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,681
I'm sorry.

625
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,309
We have to stick together,
Natalie, you know that.

626
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:28,812
I don't like to be lied to.

627
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:32,857
I just want our house
to win the World Jam. OK?

628
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,568
We have too much in this.
We've worked too hard.

629
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,947
Despite what Mom and Dad say,
it doesn't always have to be about winning.

630
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:43,117
You're starting to sound like him. You need
to remember whose side you're on.

631
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:44,869
Friggin' ridiculous!

632
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,913
Luke isn't some monster, Julien.

633
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,791
He's a good guy.
He takes care of the people that he loves.

634
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,418
Who are you going to believe?
Him or your family?

635
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,045
You're going to talk to me about family?

636
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,173
When Luke isn't even related to any of
those dancers, he would never lie to them.

637
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,052
Oh. I'm a liar? What about you?

638
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,137
How do you think your precious Luke

639
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:06,307
is going to feel when he finds out
that you have been playing him?

640
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,310
Actually, now that I think of it...

641
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,854
you should come clean.

642
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,523
That might be what I need
to throw his game off for World Jam.

643
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:16,401
Thanks, sis. You really helped me.

644
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:21,698
You're not putting him out on the streets
over some stupid rivalry.

645
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:26,286
I will not be part of it.

646
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:44,637
Jacob. You scared me.

647
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,223
You don't seem like a girl
that's easily scared.

648
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,271
Tell Luke I'm sorry.

649
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,112
You have a choice, you know?

650
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,825
It's not that easy.

651
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,995
The most important decisions in life
are never easy.

652
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,805
Dance can reveaI a lot
about a person,

653
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,642
the way they move,
the way they learn new steps.

654
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:35,146
I mean, if you're dancing for real, it comes
from the most truthfuI part of your souI.

655
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,732
I dance to express how I feel inside,

656
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,777
whether it's anger, happiness,

657
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,320
loneliness.

658
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,906
Once I found the Vault,
it was like coming home.

659
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:49,369
This is where I feel safe.
This is where I belong.

660
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,162
This is where my family is.

661
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,164
This place is special. It's our world.

662
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,626
I think, finally,
I had somewhere I could be myself.

663
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:00,046
People say that you don't
really choose your family. We did.

664
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,924
- If you are one of us, Luke will find you.
- Yeah.

665
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:51,180
- Luke.
- Why would she just leave like this?

666
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:55,226
I don't know. But for the moment,
we've got bigger problems than that.

667
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,271
The bank's put our house up for auction.

668
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,481
- What?
- They're selling it.

669
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,902
I'm going to deal with this, all right?

670
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,823
- What the hell, Walter?
- Hey, Luke. How are you? Sit down.

671
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,491
I don't want to sit down.

672
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,201
I understand how hard this must be.

673
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,704
If you can just wait a few days,
we'll have the money.

674
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,622
You're five months behind
on your mortgage.

675
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,332
Unless you catch up with your payments,

676
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,877
I'm afraid there's nothing more
I can do for you.

677
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,754
The warehouse sits on prime property.

678
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,256
The bank is well aware
what it's going to go for at auction.

679
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,551
- I need more time.
- I'll see if I can suspend the foreclosure.

680
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,803
But don't get your hopes up.

681
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,389
They could take
your warehouse today, Luke.

682
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,350
That's not gonna happen
cos it's not for sale.

683
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,898
Look what I just got from Natalie.

684
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,066
What does it mean?

685
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:46,319
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

686
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,575
- Come with me.
- Who, me?

687
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:55,244
- Yeah, I need you.
- I have a Halloween party tonight.

688
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,413
I mean, I would, but I can't miss it.

689
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,791
College parties start late.
I'll get you back in time.

690
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,168
I'm supposed to be Ashley Olsen, man.

691
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,377
Ashley Olsen?

692
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:06,506
Yeah. You know how long it takes
to straighten this hair?

693
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,633
Come on. You're my boy.

694
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:13,137
It's been a long day, man.
I need a good friend right now.

695
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,306
All right, I got your back.

696
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,272
Oh. Invitations, please.

697
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:27,902
- Invitations? I got one on my cellphone.
- No invite, no entry.

698
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,612
Can you guys push off, please?

699
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:32,573
- Just over there.
- My name's right there. It's Jeff Bernstein.

700
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,700
- Check... Mr Bernstein.
- You know what?

701
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,662
Thank you.

702
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,789
Hey, how are you doing?

703
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,792
There's got to be another way.

704
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,552
Let's go.

705
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:57,265
And now, the broken tango.

706
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,141
Take it away.

707
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:03,646
Look, at this place, Moose. Come on.
Where you going? Luke? Luke!

708
00:58:47,464 --> 00:58:49,465
- Luke.
- I got you.

709
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:03,330
Come with me.

710
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:20,347
Hey, Camille, we're all ready for the party.
You coming?

711
01:00:20,473 --> 01:00:23,642
I'm gonna meet you guys there.
Moose'll be here like any minute.

712
01:00:23,768 --> 01:00:26,854
Giddy up, girl! Yee-ha!

713
01:00:31,026 --> 01:00:33,027
I got something for you.

714
01:00:35,238 --> 01:00:36,614
I hope you like it.

715
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,407
Your film?

716
01:00:39,618 --> 01:00:41,410
- You did it?
- Yeah.

717
01:00:41,536 --> 01:00:42,661
Luke.

718
01:00:43,705 --> 01:00:45,664
I'm so happy you finished it.

719
01:00:54,925 --> 01:00:56,842
Let's get out of here.

720
01:00:56,968 --> 01:01:00,054
- No one can see us. We're fine.
- No, I mean let's leave.

721
01:01:00,847 --> 01:01:03,933
We could go anywhere. California, even.

722
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:06,810
Come on, you can go to film school.
We can start fresh.

723
01:01:13,777 --> 01:01:17,488
Luke. I'm so glad you made it.

724
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:23,369
You know, I was a little concerned
that you wouldn't get the invitation in time.

725
01:01:23,495 --> 01:01:26,413
- What are you doing here?
- Julien, you invited him?

726
01:01:26,539 --> 01:01:30,084
What? I just wanted to invite him
to come celebrate the birthday

727
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,836
of my amazing and lovely sister.

728
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:36,548
He's... He's joking, right?

729
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:38,300
Wow.

730
01:01:39,052 --> 01:01:41,345
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

731
01:01:41,471 --> 01:01:43,639
- This was all a lie, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.

732
01:01:43,765 --> 01:01:46,058
- Shut up, Julien.
- Why? It was.

733
01:01:46,685 --> 01:01:50,312
Listen, at first it was,
and then I got to know you, OK?

734
01:01:50,438 --> 01:01:52,064
And I...

735
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:53,649
I started to fall for you.

736
01:01:53,775 --> 01:01:56,193
And that was real,
that's why I had to leave.

737
01:01:57,696 --> 01:01:59,738
I'm... I'm so sorry.

738
01:01:59,864 --> 01:02:03,075
- Please tell me you believe me.
- Don't touch me.

739
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:05,953
Luke, you...

740
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:11,667
- You don't need to deal with...
- Don't, Julien!

741
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:14,211
Don't worry about him. He's a loser.

742
01:02:14,337 --> 01:02:17,297
Natalie, are you really
getting mad about that?

743
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,061
Camille.

744
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:34,898
- Camille, I thought that you...
- I'm over it.

745
01:02:35,025 --> 01:02:37,151
You clearly have better things to do.

746
01:02:37,277 --> 01:02:40,362
No, Camille, it's not like that.

747
01:02:40,488 --> 01:02:43,198
- Come on, I got caught up.
- Great. Thanks.

748
01:02:43,324 --> 01:02:46,035
I... I've been dancing.

749
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:52,499
Before school, during school and after.

750
01:02:54,044 --> 01:02:59,590
So you've been lying to me
and ditching me for some secret life?

751
01:03:01,676 --> 01:03:03,927
I mean, you could have at least told me.

752
01:03:05,638 --> 01:03:10,350
But I guess I'm not important enough
in your new cool life to know.

753
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:15,105
I should have just told you. I know.

754
01:03:15,231 --> 01:03:16,940
But I'm sorry, OK?

755
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:21,862
And it's all over now.

756
01:03:21,988 --> 01:03:25,157
You're right. It's over now.

757
01:03:43,218 --> 01:03:46,470
- Luke. Luke, Luke.
- What the hell?

758
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:49,098
- Hey, man, this is bullshit.
- We tried to stop them,

759
01:03:49,224 --> 01:03:50,933
but there was nothing we could do.

760
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:53,102
We gotta get in there!
They can't do this to us!

761
01:03:53,228 --> 01:03:55,270
Luke! Hey.

762
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:57,272
I grabbed as much as I could.

763
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,316
It's Julien.

764
01:03:59,442 --> 01:04:02,694
- Julien's trying to buy the house.
- So what are we going to do now?

765
01:04:02,821 --> 01:04:05,614
Can't you see? We're finished.

766
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:08,075
But the World Jam is just around the corner.

767
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:11,370
- But if we have nowhere to rehearse...
- We have nowhere to sleep.

768
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:15,165
We're fooling ourselves,
thinking this place was going to last.

769
01:04:16,209 --> 01:04:17,876
I'm out.

770
01:04:20,463 --> 01:04:22,464
Anyone else?

771
01:04:33,017 --> 01:04:37,020
Hey, it's not your fault.
Julien started this.

772
01:04:37,147 --> 01:04:39,148
You guys deserve better than this.

773
01:04:39,274 --> 01:04:42,109
There's nothing more I can do.
I screwed up.

774
01:04:42,235 --> 01:04:44,653
The Pirates are done.

775
01:05:07,177 --> 01:05:08,177
We tried.

776
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:06,295
Hi.

777
01:07:10,174 --> 01:07:12,175
So, on a scale of one to ten...

778
01:07:15,847 --> 01:07:17,681
how much do you hate me?

779
01:07:17,807 --> 01:07:19,808
I don't hate you, Moose.

780
01:07:21,227 --> 01:07:22,352
I miss you.

781
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:28,692
And what's worse,
feeling like you don't miss me at all.

782
01:07:28,818 --> 01:07:31,528
I don't even matter to you any more.

783
01:07:33,364 --> 01:07:37,034
We spent all senior year
talking about NYU,

784
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,954
the real world, facing it together.

785
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:44,958
What changed?

786
01:07:47,962 --> 01:07:51,340
You're my best friend
in the whole wide world, Camille.

787
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:56,345
And I never want to let that go.

788
01:08:03,102 --> 01:08:06,438
My mom just sent this in the mail.

789
01:08:13,404 --> 01:08:14,780
Oh, wow.

790
01:08:14,906 --> 01:08:16,490
That's priceless.

791
01:08:18,618 --> 01:08:20,619
Cam...

792
01:08:24,749 --> 01:08:26,750
I'm sorry.

793
01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:33,882
I missed dancing,

794
01:08:34,008 --> 01:08:36,009
but...

795
01:08:36,135 --> 01:08:38,428
I'm going to have to say
I miss you more.

796
01:08:39,389 --> 01:08:40,639
Really?

797
01:08:41,432 --> 01:08:42,891
Really, really.

798
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,230
- You hear that?
- What?

799
01:08:48,356 --> 01:08:50,315
- Do you hear that right now?
- What?

800
01:08:50,441 --> 01:08:52,859
- Come here.
- What?

801
01:08:52,985 --> 01:08:54,152
What?

802
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,448
Are you serious? No, back of the line.

803
01:08:58,574 --> 01:09:00,367
Just one second, little girl. One moment.

804
01:09:00,493 --> 01:09:02,494
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, can you turn that song up a bit?

805
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,704
Do I look like a jukebox to you, pal?

806
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:07,249
Um...

807
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,333
How about five bucks?

808
01:09:08,459 --> 01:09:11,586
- Give me that. I'll be right back.
- OK.

809
01:09:14,549 --> 01:09:16,341
- Oh, my gosh.
- MSA freshmen year. We met...

810
01:09:16,467 --> 01:09:17,717
To this song!

811
01:09:17,844 --> 01:09:20,512
- This is ridiculous.
- Remember the choreography?

812
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:23,849
- Step forward... Come on, let's try it.
- No, not a chance.

813
01:09:23,975 --> 01:09:25,892
Dance with him! Please!

814
01:09:26,018 --> 01:09:28,478
- Go.
- You heard the kid. Come on.

815
01:09:30,064 --> 01:09:32,065
All right.

816
01:09:35,611 --> 01:09:37,988
Moose, stop! Oh, my gosh!

817
01:09:39,907 --> 01:09:41,908
OK, not in public.

818
01:09:42,702 --> 01:09:44,619
I'm sorry.

819
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:46,746
I'm not doing this.

820
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:49,291
Whoa!

821
01:09:50,293 --> 01:09:52,294
Moose!

822
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:55,130
Hey!

823
01:09:55,256 --> 01:09:57,257
Give me my hat back!

824
01:10:20,406 --> 01:10:21,448
Whoo!

825
01:10:28,998 --> 01:10:31,500
What are you doing? Get out of here!

826
01:10:31,626 --> 01:10:34,294
Oh, man, you know what?
I'm gonna squirt you.

827
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,422
I'm gonna squirt you! Get out of here!

828
01:10:40,009 --> 01:10:41,927
- Get outta here!
- Hey!

829
01:10:42,053 --> 01:10:43,386
I'm sorry.

830
01:10:56,943 --> 01:10:58,860
Come on! Come on! Get outta here.

831
01:10:58,986 --> 01:11:02,531
- Come on, gimme your scooter, kid.
- Hey, that's my scooter!

832
01:11:03,491 --> 01:11:05,951
You dented it, you freak!

833
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:40,986
Oh, my gosh,
you have leaves all over you.

834
01:11:42,113 --> 01:11:43,405
Oh, wow.

835
01:11:46,534 --> 01:11:50,620
You can never give it up.
You were born to dance.

836
01:11:50,746 --> 01:11:53,707
Give it up. You suck!

837
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:55,750
Really?

838
01:11:56,627 --> 01:11:58,461
Don't listen to them.

839
01:11:59,797 --> 01:12:03,008
- I know, but you gave it up.
- Yeah, cos I'm not like you.

840
01:12:03,843 --> 01:12:07,012
I'm a good dancer,
but, Moose, you're a great dancer.

841
01:12:09,015 --> 01:12:13,768
- My parents gave up everything...
- So you wouldn't have to. I know, I know.

842
01:12:13,894 --> 01:12:15,395
We can figure this out.

843
01:12:15,521 --> 01:12:17,522
Together.

844
01:12:19,483 --> 01:12:20,525
OK.

845
01:12:23,362 --> 01:12:26,489
- OK.
- Come on. Like my new hat?

846
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:29,409
Hey, Vince,
I need a coffee on table eight.

847
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,578
Everything all right?

848
01:12:31,704 --> 01:12:33,705
What do I have to do to get a menu here?

849
01:12:33,831 --> 01:12:36,207
- What are you doing here?
- I have two things to say to you.

850
01:12:36,334 --> 01:12:37,876
I'll have an egg salad sandwich,

851
01:12:38,002 --> 01:12:40,295
and I still think we can win the World Jam
and get the house back.

852
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:42,380
I'm out of egg salad sandwiches
and you're out of your mind.

853
01:12:42,506 --> 01:12:45,550
- I thought that's why you liked me.
- You're crazy. We have nobody left.

854
01:12:45,676 --> 01:12:48,511
But I'm here. Means we got one back.

855
01:12:48,638 --> 01:12:53,516
Luke, you're the only one that can get
everybody back together to save your house.

856
01:12:53,643 --> 01:12:56,227
- The Pirates just need your leadership.
- They don't need me.

857
01:12:56,354 --> 01:12:58,313
I took what my parents gave me
and threw it away.

858
01:12:58,439 --> 01:12:59,814
You don't know what you've done.

859
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:03,610
Luke, you gave these people a place
where they can live out their dreams.

860
01:13:03,736 --> 01:13:05,904
- Sit down, man.
- Dude, I got tables to work.

861
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:07,989
No, no, no, just take a seat.

862
01:13:08,115 --> 01:13:11,785
- This better be quick.
- You never asked why I wanted to dance.

863
01:13:11,911 --> 01:13:13,620
You want to know why?

864
01:13:13,746 --> 01:13:16,373
I dance
because dance can change things.

865
01:13:17,917 --> 01:13:22,087
One move can set
a whole generation free, like Elvis.

866
01:13:23,464 --> 01:13:24,381
Uh-huh.

867
01:13:24,507 --> 01:13:27,759
One move can make you believe there's
something more. Remember this one?

868
01:13:31,347 --> 01:13:32,263
Ow!

869
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,724
Moose, sit down before
you make a fool out of both of us.

870
01:13:38,312 --> 01:13:40,939
And some moves...

871
01:13:41,065 --> 01:13:43,983
can give a skinny, curly-haired kid...

872
01:13:46,278 --> 01:13:48,780
that just wants to dance...

873
01:13:52,076 --> 01:13:54,244
some... some hope.

874
01:13:57,415 --> 01:13:59,416
Hope that he's actually special.

875
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:03,169
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello? Coffee?

876
01:14:03,295 --> 01:14:05,505
Decaf, don't want it. Regular.

877
01:14:06,882 --> 01:14:09,050
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do regular.

878
01:14:09,176 --> 01:14:11,219
I tried. It's just not me.

879
01:14:11,345 --> 01:14:15,515
- I've been waiting here for 30 minutes.
- Hey, he can't do regular, the man said.

880
01:14:15,641 --> 01:14:18,977
Great, Fred Astaire. I didn't pay
for a floorshow. I paid for some coffee.

881
01:14:19,687 --> 01:14:22,814
OK, that's cool, Moose, but how are we
going to get everyone together?

882
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,899
I had to get everybody here somehow.

883
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:29,279
Man, did I miss you guys!

884
01:14:29,405 --> 01:14:31,740
My mornings are way too quiet
without you guys yapping.

885
01:14:31,866 --> 01:14:36,411
- You see? I told you he would miss us.
- Yeah, OK, OK, you're right.

886
01:14:36,537 --> 01:14:40,165
Look, I know the odds are against us.
We have no house, no routine.

887
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:42,417
Hell, I don't even know
how we're going to do this.

888
01:14:42,543 --> 01:14:44,753
But I believe in us, and I know you do too.

889
01:14:44,879 --> 01:14:46,504
That's what I'm talking about.

890
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:51,259
We've come way too far to stop now.
I know we can win this.

891
01:14:51,385 --> 01:14:54,095
We be the Pirates!
We be the Pirates!

892
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:55,472
We be the Pirates!

893
01:14:55,598 --> 01:14:57,724
We still don't have a place to rehearse.

894
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:00,852
Don't worry about it.
Moose said he found us a place.

895
01:15:11,071 --> 01:15:12,447
Moose!

896
01:15:13,949 --> 01:15:17,535
- Kido!
- Doggone! There you are!

897
01:15:20,456 --> 01:15:22,832
- What's up?
- I miss you.

898
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:25,043
I miss you. Come here, give me a hug.

899
01:15:26,378 --> 01:15:30,423
Guys, hey, this is Kido.
We used to dance together in high school.

900
01:15:30,549 --> 01:15:34,761
Am I missing something? What do these
games have to do with the World Jam?

901
01:15:34,887 --> 01:15:38,264
You said you needed space, right?
I got you, brother.

902
01:15:39,308 --> 01:15:41,684
- Brother?
- Come on.

903
01:15:42,228 --> 01:15:44,354
Nice to meet you.

904
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:52,028
Come on. This way, watch your step.
You're gonna like this place.

905
01:15:52,154 --> 01:15:54,405
Just come.

906
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:56,491
Da-da!

907
01:15:56,617 --> 01:15:58,535
See, I told you.

908
01:15:58,661 --> 01:16:01,329
Whoo-hoo! OK, I like it, man.

909
01:16:01,455 --> 01:16:03,790
I used to love this game
when I was little.

910
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:05,917
Who do they belong to?

911
01:16:06,043 --> 01:16:09,879
Oh, me. I watch them after school
because their parents work here.

912
01:16:10,005 --> 01:16:12,340
I don't know.
Do you think this is gonna work?

913
01:16:12,466 --> 01:16:15,677
And there's so much junk. There's no room,
and we barely have any dancers.

914
01:16:15,803 --> 01:16:18,054
Yeah, and the Samurai,
they outnumber us two to one.

915
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,723
He has a point.

916
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:24,853
Hold that thought.

917
01:16:27,106 --> 01:16:29,107
Come on.

918
01:16:43,873 --> 01:16:46,791
Oh, my God! MSA Crew!
Long time, no see!

919
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:49,836
Kido! You ruined our slow-motion thing!

920
01:16:52,423 --> 01:16:54,507
Guys, I thought you might need
some extra dancers.

921
01:16:54,633 --> 01:16:56,843
Pirates, meet the MSA Crew.

922
01:16:56,969 --> 01:16:59,012
Hey, let's show them what we got.

923
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,890
A highly good idea, Kido.

924
01:17:02,016 --> 01:17:03,641
All right, so first up we got,

925
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:06,060
we got a floor master, Monster.

926
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:10,189
Yeah, that's tight.

927
01:17:10,983 --> 01:17:12,275
Whoo!

928
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:16,112
We got Cable, the man with no bones.

929
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,407
Whoo!

930
01:17:22,036 --> 01:17:24,621
Fly, Fly can groove and shake.

931
01:17:32,546 --> 01:17:34,672
The popping tapper, Hair.

932
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:43,097
Last but not least, Smiles,
ladies and gentlemen.

933
01:17:55,235 --> 01:17:56,986
All right, guys, I think this is gonna work.

934
01:17:57,112 --> 01:17:59,447
Work? We gonna kick some ass!

935
01:18:12,586 --> 01:18:15,296
Whoo!

936
01:19:02,761 --> 01:19:04,637
Will we win the World Jam?

937
01:19:08,976 --> 01:19:10,977
You may have...

938
01:19:11,854 --> 01:19:13,146
Hey.

939
01:19:13,272 --> 01:19:14,939
Hey, yo! Zoltan!

940
01:19:15,065 --> 01:19:17,525
Hey, machine!
Yo, give me my money back, man.

941
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:34,709
Hey, guys, check this out.
This is for the World Jam.

942
01:19:34,835 --> 01:19:36,753
Imagine these lights on this shirt.

943
01:19:36,879 --> 01:19:38,504
Oh! Oh!

944
01:19:39,423 --> 01:19:40,548
Oh God! Oh God!

945
01:19:45,512 --> 01:19:47,180
That didn't work.

946
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,989
Game over.

947
01:20:05,115 --> 01:20:09,410
- I like your dance moves.
- I like your accent.

948
01:20:09,536 --> 01:20:11,704
You like my accent? That's good.

949
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:13,956
I like yours.

950
01:20:15,084 --> 01:20:16,501
I don't have a accent.

951
01:20:36,688 --> 01:20:39,732
Carlos. I knew you'd come back.

952
01:20:39,858 --> 01:20:41,859
- We need you, man.
- You need me, huh?

953
01:20:41,985 --> 01:20:43,611
- Yeah.
- Well, check this out.

954
01:20:43,737 --> 01:20:45,613
I got a message from Julien.

955
01:20:45,739 --> 01:20:48,491
- I've been training with the Samurais, right?
- What?

956
01:20:48,617 --> 01:20:52,036
- They want to offer you a deal.
- Is this a joke?

957
01:20:52,162 --> 01:20:55,206
If you want the house back,
you can have it back, free and clear.

958
01:20:55,332 --> 01:20:58,042
- What's the catch?
- Throw the battle.

959
01:20:58,168 --> 01:21:00,086
- Throw the battle?
- Yeah.

960
01:21:00,212 --> 01:21:03,506
Can't you see? I'm trying to give you all
a chance to have what you want.

961
01:21:03,632 --> 01:21:06,217
- How could you do this?
- This is real life, Luke.

962
01:21:06,343 --> 01:21:09,345
When you gonna wake your ass up
and see that?

963
01:21:09,471 --> 01:21:13,266
It's time to grow up.
The Samurai will win at any cost.

964
01:21:13,392 --> 01:21:15,518
You need to leave now.

965
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:20,106
Think about it. The offer stands.

966
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:24,485
Or you can take your chances
at the battle.

967
01:21:48,177 --> 01:21:50,595
What's up, everybody?

968
01:21:50,721 --> 01:21:52,513
My name is Grandmaster Caz,

969
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,350
and I'd like to welcome you
to the biggest dance battle on Planet Earth.

970
01:21:56,476 --> 01:22:01,731
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the World Jam!

971
01:22:03,525 --> 01:22:04,650
Let's go!

972
01:22:32,137 --> 01:22:34,388
Coming up next, our main event,

973
01:22:34,514 --> 01:22:37,934
the World Jam Championship Matchup.

974
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:41,687
The House of Pirates
versus the House of Samurai.

975
01:22:41,813 --> 01:22:46,734
And this battle
is the battle you won't forget.

976
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:47,944
Stick around.

977
01:22:56,203 --> 01:22:57,954
Don't worry about those guys, we got this.

978
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,624
Yeah, baby!

979
01:23:02,334 --> 01:23:05,211
Yes! Are you all excited?

980
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:09,548
Luke.

981
01:23:12,052 --> 01:23:13,761
I'm so sorry.

982
01:23:13,887 --> 01:23:15,888
Look, I know I lied to you.

983
01:23:17,641 --> 01:23:21,477
But everything we had was real.

984
01:23:21,603 --> 01:23:23,646
I'm leaving tomorrow.

985
01:23:25,274 --> 01:23:27,275
I'm taking a train to California.

986
01:23:28,235 --> 01:23:30,987
And I wouldn't have the courage to do that
without you.

987
01:23:31,905 --> 01:23:33,864
I know you have dreams, too.

988
01:23:33,991 --> 01:23:36,325
This is crazy...

989
01:23:38,537 --> 01:23:40,162
but come with me.

990
01:23:42,582 --> 01:23:44,625
What makes you think
I would trust you again?

991
01:23:48,338 --> 01:23:51,549
Because that person
that I was only with you...

992
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,511
.. that's who I really am.

993
01:23:55,637 --> 01:23:59,140
Right about now,
Pirates to the stage!

994
01:24:00,017 --> 01:24:02,226
Let's hear it for the Pirates, y'all.

995
01:24:02,352 --> 01:24:04,270
Luke!

996
01:24:06,273 --> 01:24:07,815
Good luck today.

997
01:24:07,941 --> 01:24:10,651
Here they come.
Here they come. Here come the Pirates.

998
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:13,070
They look determined, they look ready.

999
01:24:13,196 --> 01:24:17,658
But is it enough
to upset the mighty Samurai?

1000
01:24:17,784 --> 01:24:20,202
Only time will tell.

1001
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:22,455
Samurai, to the stage!

1002
01:24:23,832 --> 01:24:27,126
And here they come,
in the black and gold, the Samurai!

1003
01:24:27,252 --> 01:24:30,504
Looks like they mean serious business.

1004
01:24:32,966 --> 01:24:35,718
Let's go!

1005
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,664
Pirates, come on.
First round, there it is.

1006
01:25:08,085 --> 01:25:11,212
Here come the Samurai.
Let's see what they're working with, people.

1007
01:25:47,624 --> 01:25:49,625
Uh-oh. This looks personal.

1008
01:26:44,306 --> 01:26:47,641
Walk. I'm feeling that.
That's old school. That's old school.

1009
01:26:51,897 --> 01:26:55,733
Oh, my God,
it's a freak show out there, people.

1010
01:28:25,991 --> 01:28:27,992
Look, Ma! No hands!

1011
01:28:34,749 --> 01:28:37,084
This is a massacre, people.

1012
01:28:48,096 --> 01:28:51,348
Samurai's wiping up the floor
with these guys.

1013
01:28:51,474 --> 01:28:55,352
It looks like it's over.
It looks like it's over, people.

1014
01:28:56,354 --> 01:29:01,025
- Hey, we can take 'em.
- You said so yourself, we're not ready.

1015
01:29:01,985 --> 01:29:03,694
You can trust me.

1016
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:07,990
It looks like it's over. There's no way
the Pirates can come back from this.

1017
01:29:10,368 --> 01:29:13,621
What's this?
The Pirates are answering back.

1018
01:29:14,205 --> 01:29:16,874
- Get off the stage.
- Get off me!

1019
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,542
- Stop it!
- What are you doing?

1020
01:29:18,668 --> 01:29:21,045
- You can't do this. You're Samurai.
- Not any more.

1021
01:29:21,171 --> 01:29:23,464
- What happened to family?
- This is my family, Julien.

1022
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:25,758
Get off me.

1023
01:29:25,884 --> 01:29:27,801
Let's get back to business, people.

1024
01:29:30,388 --> 01:29:32,598
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

1025
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:50,407
Yeah!

1026
01:30:08,301 --> 01:30:12,179
Oh, no! Here she comes!
Go, go, go!

1027
01:30:16,476 --> 01:30:21,105
Perfect landing, baby.
I give that a ten. I give that a ten.

1028
01:30:28,738 --> 01:30:31,407
All right, y'all, let's go.
What are they doing?

1029
01:30:31,533 --> 01:30:34,118
What are they trying now? It ain't over yet.

1030
01:30:35,662 --> 01:30:36,995
Whoa! Oh!

1031
01:30:37,122 --> 01:30:38,997
Are you kidding me?

1032
01:31:19,581 --> 01:31:22,082
You can't get those shoes
at Foot Locker, people.

1033
01:31:27,464 --> 01:31:29,465
It's getting tribal in here.

1034
01:32:07,962 --> 01:32:10,130
Now, here's the Pirate shorties!

1035
01:32:10,256 --> 01:32:12,257
Oh, my!

1036
01:32:37,158 --> 01:32:39,827
(♪ David Rush: Shooting Star

1037
01:32:46,543 --> 01:32:49,711
Boom! In your face!

1038
01:33:09,566 --> 01:33:12,359
That's it, that's it. It's a wrap.

1039
01:33:12,485 --> 01:33:14,570
And both of our finalists did their thing.

1040
01:33:14,696 --> 01:33:17,781
But now it's time for our judges to decide

1041
01:33:17,907 --> 01:33:20,993
who's going home
with this hundred thousand dollars.

1042
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:23,662
Judges, are you ready with your decision?

1043
01:33:23,788 --> 01:33:25,873
Whose flag you gonna raise?

1044
01:33:25,999 --> 01:33:27,916
Black and gold for the Samurai,

1045
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:30,335
or red and black for the Pirates?

1046
01:33:32,297 --> 01:33:35,132
Pirates! There it is!

1047
01:33:35,258 --> 01:33:38,093
The House... Oh, my God!

1048
01:33:38,219 --> 01:33:40,470
The House of Pirates
are the winners

1049
01:33:40,597 --> 01:33:46,226
of the first annual World Jam!

1050
01:33:46,352 --> 01:33:49,229
It's over. One hundred thousand dollars

1051
01:33:49,355 --> 01:33:53,066
to the House of Pirates!

1052
01:34:24,349 --> 01:34:27,768
Dear Luke, your film was so great,
I had to share it.

1053
01:34:27,894 --> 01:34:30,771
I hope you give yourself the chance
to live your dream.

1054
01:34:30,897 --> 01:34:33,398
Love, Natalie.

1055
01:34:41,407 --> 01:34:43,200
You can go to her if you want to.

1056
01:34:43,326 --> 01:34:47,079
I will take care of everything
until you get back.

1057
01:34:47,205 --> 01:34:50,123
You gave us the chance to live our dreams,

1058
01:34:50,249 --> 01:34:54,252
and now it is time for you to go
and live your dreams.

1059
01:35:01,803 --> 01:35:02,886
There it is! There it is!

1060
01:35:03,012 --> 01:35:06,890
The winners of the first annual World Jam

1061
01:35:07,016 --> 01:35:10,811
is the House of Pirates!

1062
01:35:14,148 --> 01:35:16,483
You know,
some famous guy once said,

1063
01:35:16,609 --> 01:35:19,361
"To traveI is better than to arrive. "

1064
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,281
And I was like, "What?"

1065
01:35:24,033 --> 01:35:26,702
Because I used to think that there is only

1066
01:35:26,828 --> 01:35:30,080
one path to take to where you want
to get to be in life.

1067
01:35:30,206 --> 01:35:31,707
But if you choose that one path,

1068
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:34,292
that doesn't mean you have to
abandon all the other ones.

1069
01:35:34,419 --> 01:35:39,381
I realise that it's actually what happens
along the way that counts.

1070
01:35:41,592 --> 01:35:43,677
The stumbles

1071
01:35:43,803 --> 01:35:46,513
and the falls

1072
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:49,099
and the friendships.

1073
01:35:49,225 --> 01:35:52,811
It's the journey, not the destination.

1074
01:35:54,522 --> 01:35:56,648
You just gotta, I guess,

1075
01:35:56,774 --> 01:36:00,485
trust that the future will work itself out
like it's supposed to.

1076
01:36:01,446 --> 01:36:05,323
I mean, I guess I'm asking the school
to kinda go freestyle with me here,

1077
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:06,783
but I'm ready to jump.

1078
01:36:06,909 --> 01:36:09,077
What you're asking for here

1079
01:36:09,203 --> 01:36:12,873
is a double major in engineering...

1080
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:15,584
and dance.

1081
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:17,294
Yeah.

1082
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:19,880
Well, it's certainly a first.

1083
01:36:30,808 --> 01:36:33,143
So?

1084
01:36:34,395 --> 01:36:38,648
Yeah, I mean, I...
I'm a double major, so...

1085
01:36:38,775 --> 01:36:42,652
No way, Moose! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! I can't believe it.

1086
01:36:42,779 --> 01:36:45,697
I can't believe it.
What do you mean, you can't believe it?

1087

Crazy. Don't listen to them, OK?

1105
01:38:51,449 --> 01:38:53,617
Oh.

1106
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:55,660

You're B-FAB. Remember that.

1113
01:39:24,857 --> 01:39:26,858
Take care of the house, guys.
