Ha-ha!

3
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,801
Whee!

4
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,927
<i>This story
begins in a secret place</i>

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,162
<i>hidden deep in a forest.</i>

6
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,049
Whoa, whoa!

7
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,884
<i>That is a Smurf.</i>

8
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,769
<i>We call him Clumsy.</i>

9
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,887
<i>And this is our village,</i>

10
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,407
<i>where there's a Smurf
for just about everything.</i>

11
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,925
<i>- Like Jokey.</i>

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,490
Hey, here's a present for you.

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,688
Ah!

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,969
Oh, Gullible Smurf, you're so gullible.

15
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,963
Actually, I meant to give you this one.

16
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,087
Wow! Thanks!

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,881
- 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
- Here's Hefty.

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,366
<i>And over here is...</i>

19
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,965
Now, for the one-fingered pushup.

20
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,644
One, two, three...

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,484
<i>Meet Nerdy Smurf.</i>

22
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,530
- Excuse me?
<i>- Sorry, Brainy. Just kidding.</i>

23
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,886
<i>Nosey.</i>

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,440
Hmm. Well, what's going on over there?

25
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,085
<i>Paranoid Smurf.</i>

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,441
<i>- Winner.</i>
- Hmm.

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,567
Loser.

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,846
<i>Karate Smurf.</i>

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,365
Hyah!

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,011
<i>Handy. Vanity. Farmer. Painter. Baker.</i>

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,321
<i>Magician. Scuba. Policeman. Therapist.</i>

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,811
Sometimes I just feel blue.

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,888
<i>There's even Table-Eating Smurf.</i>

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,041
Oh, hi.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,010
<i>- Yeah, we're not too sure
about him, either.</i>

36
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,526
<i>And then there's me, Papa Smurf.</i>

37
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,369
<i>I sort of run this place.</i>

38
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,727
<i>But this isn't a story about me.</i>

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,689
Whoa...

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,921
<i>Or Clumsy.</i>

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,162
<i>Or any of them.</i>

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,084
<i>It's about the only girl in our village.</i>

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,490
Smurfette.

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,766
Hi, Laundry Smurf.

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,729
- Howdy-do, Smurfette.
- Hey, guys.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,849
<i>But that's not the only thing
that's different about Smurfette.</i>

47
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,001
<i>She was created
by the evil wizard, Gargamel.</i>

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,650
<i>Using dark magic...</i>

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,608
<i>he made her from a lump of clay.</i>

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,049
Now, go and find Smurf Village.

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,763
<i>Luckily, I knew a little magic of my own.</i>

52
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,043
<i>But there was still one problem.</i>

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,363
<i>Smurfette's name doesn't tell us
anything about her.</i>

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,965
Okay, the physics are...

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,776
<i>It doesn't tell us who she is.</i>

56
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:44,312
Hyah!

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,328
- High heels.
<i>- Or what she does.</i>

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,010
<i>So, what exactly is a Smurfette?</i>

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,928
Well, let me be frank.
She's a rubbish baker.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,923
Let's see. Smurfette.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,082
Smurfette, Smurfette, Smurfette.

62
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,605
Huh. It's not here.

63
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,366
Well, Smurfette is a combination
of a Smurf and an Ette.

64
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,044
But what's an Ette?

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,164
Oh, uh, yeah.
Smurfette, well, she's...

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,844
She's the greatest.

67
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,324
The most wondrous creature on Earth.

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,368
Yes, you are.

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,930
Smurfette...

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,085
Um...

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,205
Oh! I got it.

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,604
This is one of those eternal questions
that we'll never, ever know the answer to.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,161
Huh? Wait, she is?

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,526
Do you think she heard me?

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,809
<i>So, what is a Smurfette?</i>

76
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,169
<i>No one wanted that answer
more than Smurfette herself.</i>

77
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,645
What are you doing?

78
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,846
Oh.

79
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,570
Hey, Grouchy, I was just...

80
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,483
Leaving?

81
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,961
- Um...
- This is my bench.

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,486
I come here same time every day, and I...

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,801
Ooh. Let me guess. "And grouch."

84
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,325
Exactly.

85
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,326
- I can do that.
- I can grouch.

86
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,605
Hi, Grouchy. Hi, Smurfette. Nice day, huh?

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,886
No, it's not.

88
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,883
It's gonna rain!

89
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,686
Which actually helps
the plants grow.

90
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,642
But also means it's gonna be cloudy,
so, chew on that.

91
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,848
Then again, there might be a rainbow.

92
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,048
But rainbows are dumb.

93
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,090
Just kidding. I love rainbows.

94
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,727
Ugh.

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,723
You're not very good at this, are ya?

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,246
Uh, no, I'm not.

97
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,926
In fact, you're actually kind of bad at it.

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,886
Yup.

99
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,364
But you're also bad at it.

100
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,771
That's a lie.

101
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,683
You're really, really good at it.

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,680
Hi, Brainy.

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,564
Ah. Smurfette. Thank goodness you're here.

104
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,971
I was... Whoa!

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,891
- Whoa.
- We're running trials on my new invention.

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,486
The Smurfy Thing Finder.

107
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,568
Test subject, Hefty Smurf.

108
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,051
Oh, hey, Smurfette!

109
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,724
I mean, uh...

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,644
- Hey, Smurfette.
- Oh, hey.

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,005
That thing's safe, right?

112
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,890
- Is it safe?
- Of course.

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,690
I'd get back here if I were you.

114
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,001
Snappy Bug.

115
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,201
Take this down.
Smurfy Thing Finder trial 1.03.

116
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,567
- Ready, Hefty?
- Roger that.

117
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,608
- Whoa!
- It works!

118
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,929
Wow. This thing really gets me.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,082
It's able to hone in on
Hefty's dominant trait.

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,571
Super strength.

121
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,086
Which I distill into this.

122
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,209
I call it Brainy's Super Smurfy Power Fuel.

123
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,089
Here, you can try it first.

124
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,283
All clear!

125
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,285
Yeah, you see, when you say things like
"all clear," it makes me not want to...

126
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,521
- Whoa!
- Hey, guys.

127
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,401
Hi, Clumsy.

128
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,324
You're just in time
to witness scientific history.

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,806
Oh. What's going on in here?

130
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,207
None of your business, Nosey.

131
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,042
Hmm. Well, all right.

132
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,971
Hey! If that vegetable hat
can tell us that Hefty is strong,

133
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,771
maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.

134
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,046
Power it up, Brainy.

135
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,440
Whoa.

136
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,760
Fascinating.

137
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,729
What happened?

138
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,407
Somehow, instead of sending energy out,
you absorbed it.

139
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,246
Probably something to do with the fact
that you're not a real...

140
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,961
A real Smurf? Go ahead, you can say it.

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,769
No, no, I just meant that

142
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,165
this machine wasn't built
for a Smurf of your, well, origins.

143
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,760
Yeah, it's okay. I get it.

144
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,006
Brainy.

145
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,363
Hey, you know what?
Let's all go have some fun.

146
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,805
Yeah!

147
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,848
- Pizza!
- Smurfboarding!

148
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,200
Smurfboarding!

149
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,964
It's almost ready, Azrael.

150
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,967
A pinch of newt poo.

151
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,204
A gram of calcified fungus
from between the toes of a yak.

152
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,045
And a piece of cheese
I left in my underpants last week.

153
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,161
That ought to do it.

154
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,247
Presto!

155
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,881
Twelve spherical petrification modules.

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,328
Or, as I like to call 'em, freeze balls.

157
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,966
You're welcome, Azrael. Dinner is served.

158
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,410
Ingrate.

159
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,882
Besides, these freeze balls
aren't for catching mice.

160
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,965
They're for capturing those elusive Smurfs.

161
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,371
My holy grail.

162
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
The gold at the end of my rainbow.

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,607
The most potent magical ingredient
in the world.

164
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,920
Next slide.

165
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,161
Imagine the power in 100 of them combined.

166
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,290
How I've searched high and low,
under every rock, it seems,

167
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,124
with no sign of them anywhere.

168
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,283
Not now, Azrael.
I'm in the middle of a lecture.

169
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,884
My plan is simple.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,130
Find Smurf Village, capture all the Smurfs,
drain them of their magic

171
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,843
and, finally, use that magic to become
the most powerful wizard in the world!

172
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,610
Oh, look at me with hair.

173
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,643
What?

174
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,166
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

175
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,766
Blue blazes!

176
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,569
I've spotted Smurfs in the forest!

177
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,088
Well, it's my telescope. Monty!

178
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,007
Come, my majestic eagle.

179
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,166
Your talons are digging into my shoulders.
Ow!

180
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,241
Oh, that's better.

181
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,322
Now, fly.

182
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,165
Go capture me some Smurfs.

183
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,810
No, no!

184
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,406
No, you're going the wrong way!

185
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,481
Ha-ha!

186
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,002
Ooh! Whoo!

187
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,686
Whoa! Huh!

188
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,524
Hyah! Yeah!

189
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,764
Ooh! Whoa.

190
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,568
Whoa!

191
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,521
Yeah!

192
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,286
Whoo-hoo!

193
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,921
Oh, no.

194
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,122
My turn!

195
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,850
Safety third.

196
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,246
Oh, boy.

197
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,125
Whoa!

198
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,924
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

199
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,361
Whoa!

200
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,086
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

201
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,164
Whoa! Yeah!

202
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,241
Wow!

203
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,527
Really takes your breath away, doesn't she?

204
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,328
This is incredible!

205
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,721
Whoa. Oh... Uh-oh.

206
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,408
Huh? Oh, no! She's getting way too close
to the Forbidden Forest.

207
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,403
She can't go over that wall. Come on.

208
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,847
Whoa! Oh!

209
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,602
No, no, no, wait. Don't go.

210
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,690
Wait. Wait, who are you? Don't be afraid.

211
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,245
Hey, you can't go in there.

212
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,649
- Smurfette!
- Smurfette!

213
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,121
- Smurfette, you okay?
- What happened? What happened?

214
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,090
I saw a Smurf.

215
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,406
- What?
- Who was it?

216
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,165
I don't know, but he was wearing this.

217
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,723
Smurfette! Code blue!

218
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,847
Guys, come on.

219
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,649
We've gotta get her.

220
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,961
I have a bad feeling about this.

221
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,201
Oh, do you?

222
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,365
Does it have to do with the giant vulture
carrying our friend off to Gargamel's lair?

223
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,641
Monty, my regal raptor.

224
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,609
You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.

225
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,806
Give me a kiss.

226
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,485
Finally, you bring me
what I've been asking for.

227
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,166
A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless... You!

228
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,131
Let me out of here,
you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.

229
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,808
Oh, is that any way to talk to the man
who brought you into this world?

230
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,090
I'd prefer it if you just called me "Papa."

231
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,645
- I would never call you that.
- Your loss.

232
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,562
What's this? What are you hiding?

233
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,847
Hand it over, you pseudo-Smurf.

234
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,526
Thank you, Azrael.

235
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,887
Hmm.

236
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,327
What do we have here? Hmm...

237
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,321
A different design?
Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.

238
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,084
Slightly before you did, in fact.

239
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,409
- Where did you get it?
- I'm not telling you anything.

240
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,403
- Tell me.
- No.

241
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,686
- Tell me!
- No!

242
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,171
- You better tell me.
- No!

243
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,210
- Fine. Don't tell me.
- I won't.

244
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,605
Stupid reverse psychology
never works.

245
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,763
Who cares?
You've already given me what I need.

246
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,524
Come along, Azrael.

247
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,442
Ah, where on earth
did I put those ingredients?

248
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,727
Oh, I know this. Go left, then right,
back handspring, stick the landing.

249
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,722
Is it a person, book or movie?

250
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,644
No one ever understands
your hand signals, Hefty.

251
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,327
Ah, never mind.
Just follow me and stay close.

252
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,125
Wart of worm and hair of cat.

253
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,330
Show me the home of this Smurf hat.

254
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,687
<i>Long have you searched
for these creatures of blue.</i>

255
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,923
<i>But this hat comes from somewhere new.</i>

256
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,082
Yes. Where? Where does it come from?

257
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,290
<i>A village of Smurfs,
where enchantment grows.</i>

258
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,603
Oh. An entire village. Good. Go on. Go on.

259
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,205
<i>The location of which...</i>

260
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,681
<i>- Yes?
- nobody knows.</i>

261
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,243
No! Just start with that.
Start with "I don't know."

262
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,810
Lousy cheap-o cauldron.

263
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,490
Ow!

264
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,483
<i>But here is a clue.</i>

265
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,440
Fascinating. But what is it?

266
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,560
Trees?

267
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,000
Must be a symbol for something, or a code.

268
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,801
Trees, trees, breeze, knees.
Babies crawl on their knees.

269
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,564
Check all the nurseries in the area!

270
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,408
We're going to need to
disguise ourselves as babies.

271
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,324
Now, where can I get a giant diaper?

272
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,370
Azrael, it's not your map.

273
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,922
You want your own map, we'll get you
your own map, but this is my...

274
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,805
Wait a minute. Look what I found.

275
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,086
Three tall trees, in the Forbidden Forest.

276
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,129
We've never searched there before.

277
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,801
I'm a genius.

278
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,241
Psst.

279
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,210
Azrael, it's time to take a road trip.

280
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,841
Shh.

281
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,206
Prepare my trail mix.

282
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,126
Oh, Smurfette, congratulations.

283
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,604
You've just led me
to an undiscovered population of Smurfs.

284
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,761
They have no idea we even exist.

285
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,002
I'll be like...

286
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,809
They'll be all like, "Oh, no!"

287
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,370
And I'll be like...

288
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,523
- And they'll be like...
- "Run! No! Run, run, run!"

289
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,170
You evil little genius.

290
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,131
The rotten apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree after all.

291
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,690
Does it?

292
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,530
Get your fur and feathers in gear, boys.
We leave at first light.

293
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,087
Right after breakfast, say 8:00, 8:30.
9:00 at the latest.

294
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,970
- Wait, Brainy, the map.
- I'm on it.

295
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,127
Fine, maybe 9:30.
Absolutely no later than 10:00, though.

296
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,201
What the...

297
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,367
- It's a jailbreak!
- Go, go, go!

298
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,330
They know my plans.
They'll ruin everything!

299
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,330
Is this safe?

300
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,847
Well, it's a giant crossbow,
so I'm gonna go with "no."

301
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,649
Don't let them escape.

302
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,004
Aah!

303
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,243
- Where are the seat belts?
- Get them! Get those Smurfs!

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,650
Fire in the hole!

305
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,164
Get those Smurfs!

306
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,050
Azrael's gaining on us.

307
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,804
Incoming bird!

308
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,246
- This might hurt.
- No!

309
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,681
Huh?

310
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,283
Come on. Smurf this way.

311
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,251
Run faster! Run faster!

312
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,482
Why are our legs so short?

313
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,642
Why are our feet so big?

314
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,167
- Why are my muscles so big?
- Really, man?

315
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,651
Guys! Guys! A little help here.

316
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,320
It's coming.

317
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,807
- Yes!
- All right!

318
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,522
Well, I know four Smurfs
who have some explaining to do.

319
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,284
- Oh, boy.
- Hi.

320
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,886
- Oh, my gosh.
- Papa, you will not believe it.

321
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:51,228
We ran into the
Forbidden Forest.

322
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,282
One at a time. One at a time.

323
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,966
Please. Please.

324
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,611
- Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.
- We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.

325
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,760
I've told you time and again,
the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.

326
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,050
And now you're talking about maps
and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.

327
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,724
None of this makes any sense,

328
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,883
and I really don't understand
why you can't follow simple rules.

329
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,281
You snuck out and it put you all in danger.

330
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,051
Seems to me the only way
I can keep you safe is if...

331
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,565
You're grounded.

332
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,766
- Grounded? No, not grounded!
- What? No way!

333
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,410
- But, Papa, but...
- Come on!

334
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,561
NO "buts-ll

335
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,369
None of you are to take one step
out of your mushrooms

336
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,329
without telling me where you're going.
Do you understand that?

337
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,289
- You're right, Papa.
- Huh? What?

338
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,203
- Huh?
- You're right.

339
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,406
I don't know what we were thinking.

340
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,087
Uh, good. Because, as I was saying,
you behaved completely irresponsibly.

341
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,562
Yes. Right. Exactly.
I couldn't agree more. Right, guys?

342
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,165
- Uh... Yeah, right.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

343
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,810
- What are you talking about, Smurfette?
- Okay.

344
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,962
Yes, so... And furthermore...

345
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,646
In fact, I think we should all
go to our rooms right now

346
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,085
and think about what we've done.

347
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,208
- Well, I think that's...
- Tough, but fair.

348
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,441
- Come on, guys.
- Okay, okay.

349
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,726
- Okay, I'm moving.
- What's your endgame here?

350
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,086
Did you get pecked
on the noggin, Smurfette?

351
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,083
- Actually, Smurfette...
- Don't worry, Papa.

352
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,050
We are certainly going to do
some thinking about what we did.

353
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,281
And so forth.

354
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,442
But we will definitely not be
leaving our rooms

355
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,284
until we've thought this whole thing out.

356
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,125
And then, just for good measure,
we'll think about it some more.

357
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,645
Yes, but...

358
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,926
Great talk, Papa.

359
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,607
Huh.

360
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,411
I have no idea what I'm doing.

361
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,807
<i>We go hide away in daylight</i>

362
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,647
<i>We go undercover, wait out the sun</i>

363
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,520
<i>Got a secret side in plain sight</i>

364
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,649
<i>Where the streets are empty,
that's where we run</i>

365
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,963
<i>Everyday people do everyday things</i>

366
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,402
<i>But I can't be one of them</i>

367
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,691
<i>I know you hear me now</i>

368
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,127
<i>We are a different kind</i>

369
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,931
<i>We can do anything</i>

370
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,050
<i>We could be heroes</i>

371
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,767
<i>We could be</i>

372
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,962
Hefty, I know that's you.

373
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,326
'Sup, Smurfette?

374
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,606
Brainy.

375
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,966
How did you do that?

376
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,883
And, I assume, Clumsy.

377
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,681
Whoa-oh!

378
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,888
- All good.
- What are you guys doing out here?

379
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,883
We knew you were up to something.

380
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,883
This is all my fault, Hefty.

381
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,045
But, Smurfette, the Forbidden Forest?
It's too dangerous.

382
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,885
I have to at least warn that lost village.

383
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,884
Well, we're Team Smurf,
and we stick together.

384
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,088
So, we're coming with you.

385
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,571
I can't ask you to do that.

386
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,211
- You didn't ask.
- We volunteered.

387
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,251
- Thanks, guys.
- First things first.

388
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,410
Wow! Bug technology. Cool.

389
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,448
According to my map, we should be standing

390
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,962
right in front of this
very large, tall stone wall.

391
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,331
Check.

392
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,366
One small step for four small Smurfs...

393
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,602
- Okay.
- Let us proceed.

394
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,005
Wow.

395
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,323
Wow, wow, wow.

396
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,922
Wow, wow, wow.

397
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,206
Wow.

398
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,491
Smurfette! You okay, Smurfette?

399
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,486
Nice flowers. Nice flowers.

400
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,722
Not nice flowers!

401
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,446
<i>Out till the sunup</i>

402
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,521
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

403
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,967
<i>Twisted and burn up, can't nobody stop us</i>

404
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,605
<i>We gone delirious</i>

405
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,245
<i>La la la la la</i>

406
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,288
<i>La la la la la la, gimme some of that</i>

407
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,361
Whoa!

408
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,005
<i>Gimme some of that</i>

409
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,161
<i>We gone delirious</i>

410
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,004
<i>La la la la la</i>

411
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,889
<i>La la la la la la</i>

412
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,961
<i>Come and take a ride</i>

413
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,041
Whoa!

414
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,168
<i>Take it all night, who cares?</i>

415
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,011
Whoa...

416
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,890
- Whoa!
- Aah!

417
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,211
<i>Gimme some of that, gimme some of that</i>

418
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,441
<i>Gimme some of that</i>

419
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,610
<i>La la la la</i> la...

420
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,007
Where's Clumsy?

421
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,889
Hey! We just met! I'm
not that kind of Smurf.

422
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,125
Watch out for the steep embankment.

423
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,528
Clumsy, you okay?

424
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,401
I'm seeing stars.

425
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,641
Whoa.

426
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,687
- Ooh.
- Wow.

427
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,884
Good work, Clumsy.

428
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,009
You may have discovered
a new subspecies of flying insectoid.

429
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,281
Amazing! A winged,
fire-breathing Anisoptera.

430
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,011
Mmm, let's see. How
should we classify this?

431
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,128
Hmm, maybe.

432
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,567
I mean, seems like an easy choice,
but I'm just not sure.

433
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,650
- Yeah, okay, let's go with "dragonfly."
- Hopefully more "fly" than "dragon."

434
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,923
Nope! Less "fly"! Less "fly"!

435
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,367
Whoa, guys!

436
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,846
Whoa...

437
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,731
Whoa.

438
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,121
I'm okay.

439
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,449
A little help here.

440
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,722
Monty, get off of me.

441
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,925
I hate nature.

442
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,487
How gaudy.

443
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,765
Hmm? Ow, ow!

444
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,248
Azrael, do something!

445
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,323
It's quite painful.

446
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,529
Stop laughing. This is not funny.

447
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,446
Watch it!

448
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,967
Let me go!

449
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,121
Ouch.

450
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,602
Hmm. These nests are made of some material
I've never seen before.

451
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,529
Whoa!

452
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,001
You know, I think I've had enough
of these flying Antipastos for one day.

453
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,085
Hey! What are you doing here?

454
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,447
Well, I was thinking of getting
a little place out here.

455
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,648
Just a quiet place in the forest.

456
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,088
It's a little breezy up on the hill.
What do you think I'm doing out here?

457
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,403
You are never going to find
that village, Gargamel.

458
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,404
Oh, Smurfette, if it wasn't for you,

459
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,642
I wouldn't even know
about those other Smurfs.

460
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,489
- Get 'em, boys.
- Smurfintine formation! Go!

461
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,407
- Hey!
- Smurfintine!

462
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,084
- Get 'em, Azrael!
- Smurfintine!

463
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,083
- Smurfintine!
- Smurfintine!

464
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,529
Ow!

465
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,001
Smurfintine!

466
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,447
Hey, you. You're the clumsy one, right?

467
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,601
- Huh?
- Think fast.

468
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,924
I caught it.

469
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,766
This isn't good.

470
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,840
- Clumsy, give 'em back their egg!
- Okay.

471
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,005
Oh, come on!

472
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,401
- Clumsy!
- I'm trying!

473
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,524
Whoa!

474
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,931
I'm really, really sorry, guys!

475
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,886
Over there!

476
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,962
I didn't mean to poach your egg.

477
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,041
Whoa!

478
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,362
Well, they're toast.

479
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,965
Ah, it doesn't matter.

480
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,724
What's a few worthless pennies

481
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,282
when there's a pot of gold
at the end of my rainbow?

482
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,047
Trust me, they're goners.

483
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,283
I'm telling you,
they've been fried to a blue crisp.

484
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,885
They're Smurf kabobs.

485
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,200
Smurfberry flambe.

486
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,850
Marshmallows.

487
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,843
Can it, fuzzball. They're dead.

488
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,729
Dead, I say!

489
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,566
Hello?

490
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,850
Smurfette?

491
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,169
Echo!

492
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,409
Darkness.
I don't do well in the darkness.

493
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,369
I have enough trouble in the daylight.

494
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,081
Hold on, everyone.
We need to find a way out of here.

495
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,290
That is good thinking, "Brainy."

496
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,203
- Guys?
- Darkness!

497
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,922
Don't be scared. Just...
Just think happy thoughts.

498
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,571
It's not really
happy times right now!

499
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,769
- Just stay in the light, Clumsy.
- Too late.

500
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,444
I'm walking into the darkness!

501
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,124
What are you... Why?

502
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,363
I'm really freaking out, you guys!

503
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,408
Stop, everyone.

504
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,008
Okay, go into your backpacks,
get out your emergency tunnel survival kit,

505
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,041
find the small glass vial marked "light,"
and shake it really hard.

506
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,808
Clumsy? How you doing?

507
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,405
Okay, I guess.

508
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,090
Just hang tight, Clumsy.

509
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,846
I'm not sure how long this will take
or how long we'll be down here,

510
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,608
so, everybody, whatever you do,
don't eat all your rations.

511
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,887
I just ate all my rations!

512
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,531
- Clumsy!
- I'm stress-eating!

513
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,011
I'm coming, Clumsy.

514
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,521
Follow the sound of my voice.

515
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,762
Wait! These tunnels are like a maze.

516
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,491
- We'll just get more lost.
- We gotta do something.

517
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,040
I'm with her. Time for some action.

518
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,122
We're doing this all wrong.

519
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,247
Smurfette!

520
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,448
I'm close, Clumsy.
Almost there.

521
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,205
That's just the echo
playing tricks on us.

522
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,248
- Anybody?
- I'm here.

523
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,846
I'm here right around this corner.

524
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,445
Hey, everybody?

525
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,002
My light is going out.

526
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,721
That is it! I'm punching us out of here.

527
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,206
It's collapsing.

528
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,841
Hefty! Put those fists away
before you get us killed!

529
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,002
At least I'm trying something.

530
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,566
- I'm gonna blow us out of here!
- No!

531
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,210
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't!

532
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,441
Too late!

533
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,362
Clumsy?

534
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,407
"Hmm?

535
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,684
- Hey, Smurfette.
- Clumsy!

536
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,483
Whoa!

537
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,840
Whoa!

538
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,122
Hang on. I'm coming, Clumsy bro.

539
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,806
I got you, little buddy.

540
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,040
Yeah! Yee-haw!

541
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,891
Stampede!

542
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,763
I think my rations are coming up.

543
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,161
Oh! Whoa, whoa.

544
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,246
What? What's so funny?

545
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,641
Now, that's what I call
"talking out of your butt."

546
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,166
Oh, boys.

547
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,926
Would anyone be interested in knowing
that we're in sight of three tall trees?

548
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,081
- All right.
- Yeah, we are.

549
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,164
And Bucky is gonna get us there extra fast.

550
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,447
- Bucky?
- Seems like a Bucky to me.

551
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,043
Hit it, Bucky!

552
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,001
Smurfette?

553
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,561
Before you say anything, just listen.

554
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,287
Now, I know yesterday I might have been
a bit tough on you and the boys,

555
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,204
and I know there are times
I'm a little overprotective.

556
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,369
Okay, a lot overprotective.

557
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,284
But you have to understand, you snuck out.

558
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,124
You have to be more careful.

559
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,763
Smurfette, I know lately
you may not realize,

560
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,923
and I may not say it enough, but you are...

561
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,565
You shine.

562
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,724
So, anyway, we're Smurfy?

563
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,923
I think you and the boys
have been grounded long enough.

564
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,926
Smurfette?

565
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,531
Okay. I'm opening the door.

566
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,286
And I'm walking in to talk more.

567
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,761
You there?

568
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,411
Smurfette.

569
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,286
Hefty!

570
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,441
Brainy!

571
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,526
Clumsy! Oh, that's not even convincing.

572
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,845
When I find those Smurfs, I will
ground them for a month of blue moons.

573
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,082
Oh, what's going on in here?

574
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,723
Hmm. Well, all right.

575
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,363
Wow. Have you ever seen
something so beautiful?

576
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,404
Every day, Smurfette. Every day.

577
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,642
- Don't be weird.
- You don't be weird.

578
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,725
We can camp here for the night.

579
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,040
I'll star': Us a fire.

580
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,766
Uh, fetch me some firewood,
would you, Hefty?

581
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,888
Um, a "please" would be nice.

582
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,082
Yes, it would, but I haven't
earned my manners badge,

583
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,571
so get me some firewood.

584
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,529
Clumsy? You okay?

585
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,080
Yeah, sure. It's been fun.

586
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,369
Well, not tons of fun,
but it's had its moments.

587
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,885
Kind of.

588
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,725
You know what I'm trying to say.

589
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,802
It hasn't been that much fun.

590
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,162
Well done, Hefty. Well done.

591
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,406
All right, step one,

592
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,643
the wood should be stacked
into a tepee-like structure.

593
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:48,711
Step two, I tap this
flint with a rock and...

594
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,208
You're not even blowing on it.
You're spitting on it.

595
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,411
Hmm. That's odd. Perhaps the wood
you collected was damp, Hefty.

596
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,528
According to my manual,
it should spark right up.

597
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,440
Hey, I've got an idea.

598
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,890
No, no, no. No, no!
No! No, no, no. No, no, no!

599
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,361
- Oh, oh, oh...
- You know, you're right, Brain Man.

600
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,970
Your little book does come in handy.

601
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,647
Shame. Shame on you.
We'd be lost without this book.

602
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,803
My name is Brainy. I'm super smart
I'm the smart Smurf.

603
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,530
But I can't start a fire.

604
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,323
Okay, the damage is minimal.
The binding's still intact.

605
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,243
It smells good.

606
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,085
Just think, guys.

607
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,730
After all this time,

608
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,844
while we've been going about
our Smurfy business back home,

609
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,049
there's been other Smurfs out there,
just like us.

610
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,249
Or they could be nothing like us.

611
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,006
He's right.
We should be prepared for whatever we find.

612
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,163
Those other Smurfs might not even be blue.

613
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,208
Maybe they'll be orange.

614
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,530
Ah. I like orange.

615
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,887
What if they all wear glasses?

616
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,042
Or have big, bushy mustaches.

617
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,011
What if they have scaly skin
and sharp teeth?

618
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,488
And giant claws.
And big, beady eyes.

619
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,484
What if they have hands?

620
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,960
Good one, bro.

621
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,166
Listen,
it doesn't matter what they look like.

622
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,765
We still have to warn them.

623
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,124
Gargamel's wrong about me.

624
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,043
It's not my purpose to help him.

625
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,726
I'm meant to save those Smurfs.

626
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,005
And we're gonna help you.

627
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,209
We're Team Smurf, and
we're in this together.

628
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,566
And by "together," I mean me and you.

629
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,166
And those guys. But mostly me and you.

630
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,846
Okay, everyone. Smurfy selfie time.

631
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,130
- Say, "Blue cheese."
- Blue cheese!

632
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,561
Whoa.

633
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,160
According to the map,
we should be arriving at a river.

634
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,127
Check.

635
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,924
- Wow.
- Whoa.

636
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,526
It's like a workout for my eyeballs.

637
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,524
Okay, Bucky, let's see
how fast you can swim.

638
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,601
Hyah!

639
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,886
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

640
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,371
Come on, boy.

641
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,366
You can do it.

642
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,286
What's a little water?

643
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,561
Hey.

644
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,441
Uh-huh.

645
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,366
What's that, Bucky?

646
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,887
The river's unsafe and full
of dangerous surprises at every bend?

647
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,764
No. I didn't get any of that.

648
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,489
Perhaps Glowbunnies don't swim.

649
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,961
That's too bad.
We'd get there so much faster.

650
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,441
Fear not, my intrepid Team Smurf.

651
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,610
I didn't earn this raft-building
merit badge for nothing.

652
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,082
- Boom! Nailed it.
- Impressive, Brainy.

653
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,685
Here.

654
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,447
Ooh.

655
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,522
Stylish and practical.

656
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,484
Now, let's launch this bad boy.

657
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,565
Wait. Remember, this strange river
may hold untold surprises.

658
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,166
- We must be cautious.
- Cautious. Good point.

659
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,844
- And heave...
- Wait.

660
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,730
The currents can be unpredictable.
We must be alert and vigilant.

661
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,723
Vigilance? Good call.

662
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,007
- Now, on three, two...
- Wait!

663
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,366
We must make sure we always...

664
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,209
Bark, bark, bing, bang!

665
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,123
- Pay attention to the...
- Bong, bong, bing, bang!

666
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,326
Rate of speed of the...

667
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,528
Berp, berp, bing, dang, bong, bong!

668
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,887
Okay, and we are off.

669
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,530
Heave-ho!

670
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,047
Whoa!

671
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,645
- Bye, Bucky.
- Thanks for your help.

672
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,609
- Don't worry, we'll be fine.
- Bye, little Bucky bro.

673
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,444
<i>- Hasta la</i> bunny.
- See you on the way back!

674
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,210
Hey. What is this thing?

675
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,044
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

676
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,324
Oh. Now all I want to do is touch it.

677
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,564
At this pace,
Gargamel doesn't stand a chance.

678
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,167
Look. If we follow this river,
we'll be right on course.

679
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,401
- Right on course.
- Huh?

680
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,811
To the end of our rainbow.

681
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,202
Smurfs? I thought I left you for dead.

682
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,850
Hang on, Smurf Crew.

683
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,841
Gun it!

684
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,881
What the...

685
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,080
No.

686
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,682
- Whoa!
- Stop ruining things.

687
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,842
Ruining things is my thing.

688
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,921
What?

689
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,684
Azrael, get me a bigger stick.

690
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,841
Whoa!

691
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,609
Oh, dear.

692
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,409
Clumsy, pull the lever!

693
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,165
Seriously? But you said not to.
Is this a trick?

694
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,526
Pull it now!

695
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,721
Oh, no.

696
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,291
Whoa!

697
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,566
Whoa, whoa...

698
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,210
Huh? What's this?

699
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,487
Aah! Azrael!

700
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,642
Do something. It's never gonna stop.

701
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,202
Make the log stop spinning.
This river is killing me.

702
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,964
Whoa, whoa!

703
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,326
Look out!

704
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,611
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

705
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,640
I love you two.

706
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,205
- Yes! We did it!
- We did it!

707
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,647
- See, I always believed we would do it.
- Take that!

708
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,007
Help! Help!

709
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,447
All right. We're still on course.

710
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,760
Double-time it, Hefty.

711
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,165
Help! I'm sinking!
Please. I'm afraid of turtles!

712
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,210
Uh, guys, what's he up to now?

713
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,009
- Help!
- Forget that guy.

714
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,684
My cat can't swim.

715
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,369
We gotta help him.

716
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,286
- Are you crazy? Why?
- Because it's what I do.

717
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,330
- Listen to him!
- But he's our sworn enemy.

718
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,129
He is literally a villain.

719
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,645
I can change!

720
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,849
And I literally wear my heart
on my sleeve, okay?

721
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,486
- That's your shoulder, not a sleeve.
- I like your tattoo!

722
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,450
- We're doing this.
- Smurfette, talk some sense into him.

723
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,165
Brainy, I hate Gargamel more than anyone,
but we're Smurfs.

724
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,811
- We do the right thing.
- Thank goodness for it!

725
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,211
And we have to save him.

726
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,090
I just want to go on record
that I'm decisively against this.

727
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,243
- Whatever. We're doing it.
- Sounds awesome!

728
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,128
- Use this.
- Grab on!

729
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,049
I don't know about this.

730
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,043
You won't regret it.

731
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,562
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Such a kind Smurf.

732
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,847
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I'm okay.

733
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,720
Wet, a little tired, kind of waterlogged.
Thanks for asking, but...

734
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,165
I'm still evil, so...

735
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,930
Enjoy drowning.

736
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,563
Hope you're better swimmers
than you are judges of wizards' character.

737
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,044
Whoa! Whoa!

738
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,007
Brainy. Hefty?

739
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,121
You okay?

740
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,601
Define "okay."

741
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,045
- Where's Clumsy?
- Clumsy!

742
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,690
- 'Clumsy! Clumsy!
- Clumsy!

743
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,970
I'm good.

744
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,886
- Run away! Run away!
- Hey. I think.

745
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,166
My pack! My manual!
No! No, no, no! No, no, no!

746
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,561
My Scout manual!

747
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,125
This is all your fault!

748
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,641
- What?
- Brainy, cut it out.

749
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,326
Oh, I'm sorry. Correction.
This is your fault, too.

750
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,447
Leave her out of this.

751
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,443
Hefty, I don't need you
to fight my fights for me.

752
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,329
Wait, now you're mad at me, too?

753
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,325
Smurfette, you're the one that got us
into this whole mess in the first place.

754
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,801
Hey, I was ready to do this on my own.

755
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,281
Great. So much for Team Smurf.

756
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,364
- I want to yell about something!
- Stay out of this, Clumsy.

757
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,250
That's it, Brain Man. It's time for
you to earn your manners badge.

758
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,481
Stop it!

759
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,046
Take cover!

760
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,881
Whoa!

761
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,047
Huh?

762
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,964
Who are you? What do you want?

763
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,087
Her.

764
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,441
Huh?

765
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,404
- Move.
- Smurfette!

766
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,051
- What should we do with her?
- Look at that hair.

767
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,400
- Where's she from?
- And that dress.

768
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,243
It's you.

769
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,004
You're a girl.

770
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,846
She's a girl.

771
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,401
Oh.

772
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,761
Oh.

773
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,290
Oh.

774
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,123
This is her.
This is the Smurf I was telling you about.

775
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,686
The one from the wall?

776
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,683
She's real?

777
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,926
I'm Smurflily.

778
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,129
Hi. I'm Smurfette.

779
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,771
Oh, my geez-to-petes! I'm Smurfblossom.

780
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,763
Nice to meet you. We
don't have a Smurfette.

781
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,121
But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover,

782
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,770
Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy,
Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...

783
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,966
Hey.

784
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,849
Oh, everyone can just
introduce themselves later.

785
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,446
Look at you. You're so different.

786
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,124
I mean, sorry, but it's true.

787
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,601
Do you know how to start a fire
with just rope and a stick?

788
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,809
I do. I can show you.
Actually, Smurfstorm can show you.

789
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,406
She's the best at that kind of thing.
Right, Stormy?

790
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,006
That means "yes."

791
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,481
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
What about a double rainbow?

792
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,484
What about an upside down rainbow?

793
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,641
So, is your favorite song...

794
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,202
<i>Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

795
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,726
'Cause mine is. Your dress is so pretty.

796
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,804
Smurfblossom, remember,
work on that filter, okay?

797
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,526
- Right. Filter, filter.
- What's your deal anyway?

798
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,484
Oh, well, we came to warn you
about Gargamel.

799
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,891
- Garga?
- Garga?

800
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,007
Garga-what?

801
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,606
He's a dangerous wizard
who wants to capture all Smurfs

802
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,603
and use them for his evil magic.

803
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,682
And he knows about your lost village.

804
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,205
"Lost village"?

805
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,762
You're the ones who are lost, not us.

806
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,606
We have to take you to Smurfy Grove.

807
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,968
What do we do with these blue blobs?

808
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,010
Oh, um...

809
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,161
Bring them along.

810
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,561
Come on, Smurfette.
I'm gonna show you my room.

811
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,529
You can tell me all about Gargasmell.

812
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,250
But first, do you want to hear
my favorite song again?

813
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,721
<i>Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

814
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,211
All right, move.

815
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,327
Dang!

816
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,563
- Girl Smurfs mean business.
- You got that right.

817
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,804
Open the gate!

818
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,130
The girls are back!

819
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,401
Ew! Where did they find them?

820
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,409
Is there something wrong with them?

821
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,687
- Are they sick?
- Are they food?

822
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,081
No, no, no. They're Smurfs, just like us.

823
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,811
Except, well, they're boy Smurfs.

824
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,602
"Boy." That's a funny word.
Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy.

825
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,445
Look at me.
I'm a boy Smurf.

826
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,001
- I like 'em.
- Where do they come from?

827
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,445
- What is that?
- Where is their hair?

828
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,726
- You can see their tails.
- Oh, look.

829
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,325
- Hey, watch it!
- Brainy's log, day two.

830
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,811
We've encountered a rare new life-form.

831
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,006
Are there more like you?

832
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,650
They are at times very intimidating.

833
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,246
- Are you gonna stay here?
- And they smell nice.

834
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,970
- Hello, boy.
- More on that later.

835
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,405
- Oh, I want one!
- Boundaries!

836
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,006
Okay, that...
That's enough of that!

837
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,050
They're my friends.
That's Hefty, Brainy and Clumsy.

838
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,885
- Hey, there!
- Hooptie, Berney, Klutzy. Got it.

839
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,166
We should do name tags.

840
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,481
Wait, where are your boys?

841
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,887
You won't find any boys here.

842
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,809
I am Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.

843
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,446
This is called an introduction.
So, now, you go.

844
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,529
- Uh, I, um...
- Don't get too close, Willow.

845
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,329
Something's not right here.

846
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,880
I promise we're only here to help.

847
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,890
We came to warn you
about the evil wizard, Gargamel.

848
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,407
He has a map with a landmark
leading him to three tall trees.

849
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,687
- Show 'em, Brainy.
- Snappy.

850
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,568
Don't try any funny stuff, bug.

851
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,488
I hate to break it to you,
but those aren't trees.

852
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,964
They're waterfalls.

853
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,883
Gargamel's going the wrong way.

854
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,649
And if he went there,
then that means the Swamp of No Return.

855
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,961
There's no way he could survive.

856
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,607
Aah! Help me! Help me!

857
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,724
There's no way I'll survive!

858
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,164
With all due respect,
you don't know Gargamel.

859
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,291
Yeah, well, with no due respect,
you don't know us.

860
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,249
Trust us, he's a goner.

861
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,120
Stormy, why don't you do a little recon?
Check things out.

862
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,489
And leave you here with these four?
No way. Look at that one.

863
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,130
- Huh?
- He can't be normal.

864
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,248
I think we'll be just fine here.

865
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,650
Spitfire!

866
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,211
Okay. So, what does this
Gargamel look like?

867
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,124
Oh, you know, he's your typical wizard.

868
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,602
Long black robe,
lives alone with his cat and his bird.

869
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,205
It's sad, really.

870
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,362
You're coming with me.
You can point him out.

871
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,841
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's no way he's getting on a...

872
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,681
I feel the need to remind you,
my name is Clumsy.

873
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,891
Clumsy!

874
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,247
Don't worry. Clumsy's in good hands.

875
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,608
Oh, Stormy is the sweetest, in her own way.

876
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,287
All right, girls, in the meantime,
our guests have had a long journey,

877
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,167
so let's show them some hospitality,
Smurfy Grove style.

878
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,881
Whoo-hoo!

879
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,283
<i>I'm blue Da Ba Dee, da Ba dye</i>

880
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,967
<i>Da Ba Dee, da Ba dye, da Ba Dee, da Ba dye</i>

881
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,007
Come on.

882
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,650
<i>Da Ba Dee, da Ba dye
Da Ba Dee, da Ba dye</i>

883
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,006
Huh?

884
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,127
Go.

885
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,090
<i>Da Ba Dee, da Ba dye, da Ba Dee, da Ba dye</i>

886
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,321
<i>I'm blue, da Ba Dee, da Ba dye</i>

887
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,121
<i>Da Ba Dee, da Ba dye, da Ba Dee, da Ba dye</i>

888
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,406
<i>Da Ba Dee, da Ba dye...</i>

889
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,443
Hey, Smurfette, check this out.

890
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,010
<i>Da Ba Dee, da Ba dye, da Ba Dee, da Ba dye</i>

891
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,601
Come on!

892
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,724
<i>I have a blue house with a blue window</i>

893
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,769
<i>Blue is the color of all that I wear</i>

894
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,049
<i>Blue are the streets and
all the trees are too</i>

895
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,047
<i>I have a girlfriend and she is so blue</i>

896
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,322
<i>Blue are the people here that walk around</i>

897
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,885
<i>Blue like my Corvette
It's standing outside</i>

898
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,087
<i>Blue are the words I say and what I think</i>

899
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,085
<i>Blue are the feelings
That live inside me</i>

900
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,406
<i>I'm blue, da Ba Dee, da Ba dye</i>

901
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,849
<i>Da Ba Dee, da Ba dye, da Ba Dee, da Ba dye</i>

902
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,003
<i>Da Ba Dee, da be dye</i>

903
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,211
Whoa!

904
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,086
Flap, Monty. Flap vigorously.

905
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,165
Use your mighty condor wings
to carry your master to safety.

906
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,402
Ouch! Oh! OW!

907
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,881
Sweet mercy, they're bottom feeders!

908
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,888
Devil fish!

909
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,243
Where is my lost Smurf village?

910
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,368
Huh?

911
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,360
What? Smurfs!

912
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,721
Why won't they just die?

913
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,121
Monty, retrieve them!

914
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,330
He exists, all right.
He and his stinky cat and his dodo bird.

915
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,131
They've been terrorizing us
the entire journey.

916
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,929
He didn't like us from the start

917
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,809
He never could find our village.

918
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,486
So then he made a plan to capture us all,

919
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,961
and that's when Gargamel created Smurfette.

920
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,405
- Anyways...
- Hold up.

921
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,404
Smurfette was created by this Gargamel?

922
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,529
Oh, yeah. From a lump of clay.
Really cool story, actually.

923
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,409
I knew I didn't trust her.

924
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,369
Oh, you'd like her if you get to know her.

925
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,922
She's just like you, but nice.

926
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,923
Hold on. We got a bogey coming in.

927
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,770
That's no bogey.
That's Gargamel's big dumb bird!

928
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,320
Here, you fly.

929
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,802
Uh, that's not a great idea.
Flying's not really my thing.

930
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,370
Have you ever flown before?

931
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,930
Well, no.

932
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,082
Well, then how do you know
it's not your thing?

933
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,888
He's coming back.

934
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,686
- Uh... Oh, what do I...
- Hurry!

935
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,886
What do I do now?

936
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,170
- Oh! Good move!
- Whoa, whoa!

937
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,090
- Now, do it again!
- Okay.

938
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,440
Thanks.

939
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,971
Hyah! Oh!

940
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,161
Whoa!

941
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,851
Yes. Wait a minute.

942
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,966
I don't recognize that other Smurf.

943
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,284
They found my lost Smurf village.

944
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,286
Hey, I've got an idea.

945
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,886
Spitfire, spit fire!

946
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,969
I like the way you think.

947
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,283
I guess I'm pretty good
with dragonflies after all.

948
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,400
Monty!

949
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,370
What have they done to you,
my glorious bird of prey?

950
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,530
Smurfs!

951
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,601
Hmm?

952
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,681
Hmm.

953
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,569
Shiatsu or Swedish?

954
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,521
Probably Swedish.

955
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,124
So, about all that stuff
I said back at the beach...

956
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,771
I guess I kind of overreacted.

957
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,081
Ow.

958
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,763
Yeah. Me, too.

959
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,921
So, uh, we good?

960
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,241
- Yeah, we're good.
- Hey, guys.

961
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,602
Isn't this place awesome?

962
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,484
Doesn't she look great?

963
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,483
It's like she's one of us now.

964
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,642
She should stay with us forever.

965
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,528
Uh, one, she always looks great.

966
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,047
And two, this is getting
a little out of hand, don't you think?

967
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,603
Sorry. I can't take you seriously
with that mask on your face.

968
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,970
Hey, Smurfette, we did
what we came here to do.

969
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,690
These Smurfs know about Gargamel.

970
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,684
So, come on, let's start
thinking about heading home.

971
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,761
Home?

972
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,161
But I... I...

973
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,486
It's time to go.

974
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,680
Smurfette?

975
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,524
Incoming!

976
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,686
Turns out I do do well with dragonflies.

977
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,970
They were right. This Gargamel character,
he's real, and he's headed this way.

978
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,883
Oh, no. See? I told you...

979
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,689
Put a cork in it, Smurfette.

980
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,082
The way I see it, you and your little
boyfriends led him straight to us.

981
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,640
But, of course,
that was your plan all along, wasn't it?

982
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,326
Smurfstorm, easy.

983
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,244
Little Miss Yellow Hair
isn't even a real Smurf.

984
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,800
She was created by Gargamel.

985
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,201
The Clumsy blob told me so himself.

986
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,481
What?

987
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,131
Smurfette, is that true?

988
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,368
It's not like that.

989
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,727
She was made to help him find Smurfs.

990
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,565
Smurfette came here to help you.
We all did.

991
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,610
It's okay, Hefty. This is all my fault.

992
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,730
Girls, protection mode.

993
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,890
Come on, bro, let's help.

994
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,325
Isn't this exciting?

995
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,561
Shh!

996
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,926
Hold.

997
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,521
Hold.

998
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,361
NOW!

999
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,045
Surrender, wizard.

1000
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,724
What? Wizard?

1001
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,371
Oh, he's so old.

1002
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,044
- Is he wearing a disguise?
- Look at his face.

1003
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,610
This is impossible.

1004
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,284
He doesn't seem so tough.

1005
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,682
Yeah, Gargamel! That's what you get
when you attack Smurfy Grove.

1006
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,401
- Gargamel? What are you talking about?
- No, no, no, wait. This is a mistake.

1007
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,641
- What?
- Smurfette?

1008
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,051
That's Papa.

1009
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,963
'Papa?
'Papa?

1010
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,644
There's another funny word.

1011
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,530
Papa. Papa. Papa!

1012
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,250
Smurfblossom, no.

1013
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,005
Breathe deep
and step away from the Papa-thing.

1014
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,686
Everyone, meet Papa Smurf.

1015
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,005
Hey.

1016
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,082
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm Smurfjade.

1017
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,845
Where are the boys?

1018
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,651
- 'Sup, Papa?
- Hello there.

1019
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,006
I rode a dragonfly!

1020
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,801
Well, thank goodness you're all okay.

1021
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,723
How did you find us?

1022
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,201
I wasn't born yesterday, you know.

1023
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,685
Yeah, that's clear.

1024
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,321
Look, you four are coming home with me.
Now.

1025
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,890
Not so fast, Papa-thing.

1026
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,043
"Papa-thing"?
Are you the one in charge here?

1027
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,442
That's right.
I'm Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.

1028
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,249
I'm afraid that's quite impossible,

1029
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,084
because I happen to be
the leader of the Smurfs.

1030
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,969
Whatever you say, Papa-thing.

1031
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,327
Excuse me, do you mind not calling me that?

1032
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,448
Well, if the thing fits...

1033
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,285
By the way, where'd you learn those moves?

1034
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,725
Self-taught, actually.

1035
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,040
Impressive.

1036
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,121
Thank you.

1037
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,202
You're quite welcome.

1038
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,726
Okay, not really sure
what's happening here,

1039
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,768
but, uh, what about Gargamel?

1040
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,491
What? What is all this talk about Garga...

1041
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,286
Gargamel!

1042
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,681
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

1043
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,047
- No!
- I hope so.

1044
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,730
- Everybody, run!
- Arm yourselves!

1045
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,326
Prepare for Garmageddon!

1046
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,327
This way!

1047
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,564
Spears, now!

1048
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,688
Gargamel says freeze!

1049
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,926
That's right. Smurf-tested,
Gargamel-approved,

1050
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,402
grade-A, first-class,
high-octane freeze balls.

1051
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,126
Freeze ball! Freeze ball!
Freeze ball! Freeze ball!

1052
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,281
Look out!

1053
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,483
Well, I assume they'll still work
if I don't shout "freeze ball,"

1054
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,289
but we'll never know.

1055
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,408
- Freeze ball!
- Smurfette!

1056
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,160
- Hefty.
- It's over, Smurfette.

1057
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,285
Monty, bag o' Smurfs. Ah!

1058
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,966
It's time for you to run.

1059
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,963
- No!
- Three more for pickup.

1060
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,803
Ah, Smurfette. My little creation.

1061
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,963
You finally did what you were made for.

1062
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,281
No. It's not true.

1063
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,561
Of course it is.

1064
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,483
Why do you think you led me here?

1065
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,803
Why do you think you saved me on the river?

1066
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,724
It was all part of the plan.

1067
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:26,407
No matter how hard you try,
you can't escape your destiny.

1068
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,927
And now, you're really
of no use to me anymore.

1069
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,490
Freeze ball!

1070
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:39,681
Ah, yes, these freeze balls
only work on real Smurfs.

1071
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,764
And you are nothing more
than a lump of clay.

1072
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,924
Thank you for everything.

1073
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,528
Smurfette? How could you do this to us?

1074
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,922
Because it was her purpose.

1075
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:43,044
<i>Smurfy Thing Finder for four small Smurfs.</i>

1076
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,530
Huh?

1077
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,409
I'm sorry, you guys.

1078
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,881
No, Snappy.
I've done too much damage already.

1079
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,884
<i>We're Team Smurf,
and we're in this together.</i>

1080
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,167
<i>We're Smurfs. We do the right thing.</i>

1081
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,048
I'm not even a real Smurf.

1082
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,886
I'm not a real Smurf.

1083
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,560
We need more power!

1084
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,568
Faster, Monty. Faster.

1085
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,880
Yes.

1086
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,564
The jiggler's jiggling.

1087
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,404
The spinny thing is spinning.

1088
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,720
The smoke is going up.

1089
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,484
The bubblers are bubbling.

1090
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,681
Hubbuda, hubbuda.

1091
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,761
Perfect!

1092
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,968
Oh, it's almost there.

1093
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,161
Just keep running, old bird.

1094
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,125
Here's what we're going to do.

1095
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,521
- I pick this lock.
- Yeah?

1096
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,967
- We swing to that shelf.
- Yeah?

1097
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,042
- Pick up something heavy.
- Yeah?

1098
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,407
And use it to kill the bird!

1099
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,766
- Yeah! What?
- Yeah! Wait.

1100
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,729
You want us to kill the bird?

1101
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,962
Fine. We'll just knock him unconscious.

1102
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,491
- Genius!
- All right, then.

1103
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,721
Let's do this.

1104
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,804
They have an escape plan,
but they're going to need our help.

1105
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,524
It's time to rock the cage.

1106
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,045
Don't be weird.

1107
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,885
Yes!

1108
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,165
Okay. Now!

1109
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,811
Stop that, Azrael.

1110
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,850
I can't calibrate my machine
with all your incessant yammering.

1111
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,610
Oh, yes, Azrael, listen to it.
It purrs like a kitten.

1112
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:40,166
Oh, look at that.
Everything is in sync. Yes, yes. Good.

1113
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,926
Sweet mercy!
It's another jailbreak!

1114
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,322
- No, Gargamel. No.
- Quiet down.

1115
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,249
You'll all get your turn.

1116
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,526
In you go!

1117
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,804
No!

1118
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,162
Yes, that's the stuff.

1119
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,891
<i>Oh, it's working
It's working, it's working</i>

1120
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,290
Oh, I can feel it. I can feel the power.

1121
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,047
Oh!

1122
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,520
Check out my wizard mane.

1123
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,045
Really, man?

1124
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,926
When I'm through with these Smurfs, I'll
have all the power I've ever dreamed of!

1125
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,487
Almost all the power.

1126
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:42,961
Huh?

1127
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,921
Smurfette.

1128
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,049
Smurfette, what a lovely surprise.

1129
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,441
Are you done crying in the woods?

1130
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,411
I've shed enough tears for those Smurfs.

1131
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,481
What's this?

1132
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,484
I'm done pretending to
be something I'm not.

1133
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,088
I've come to repledge my loyalty to you,
my true Papa.

1134
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,526
- Impossible.
- She can't be serious.

1135
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,204
No, no, no, she would never.

1136
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,489
Even if I did believe you, which I don't,

1137
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,564
what could you possibly offer me
that I don't already have?

1138
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,689
A tiny little massage
that I can't even feel?

1139
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,764
How about the rest of the Smurfs?

1140
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,002
Yeah, right. Wait, what?

1141
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,538
Just think of all the
power you'll have once

1142
01:12:28,563 --> 01:12:31,635
I reveal the location
of Smurf Village.

1143
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,081
Oh, let's see now.

1144
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,322
One hundred more Smurfs,
that's 10 times the power...

1145
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,687
No. If you carry the one...

1146
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,683
Whatever. It's a lot more power.

1147
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,730
Now, why are you doing this?

1148
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,525
I'm so tired of being good.

1149
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,446
Use your power to transform me
back to my evil self.

1150
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,202
Your loyalty has returned to you.

1151
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,282
So, do we have a deal?

1152
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,885
Smurfette, no!

1153
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,247
Quiet, you vile blue rats. I'm thinking.

1154
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,767
Okay, I'm done. Let's do it.

1155
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,367
One evil Smurfette coming right up!

1156
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,642
Wait. Of course!

1157
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,401
What? Oh, what's happening?

1158
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,642
No! No!

1159
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,046
What are you doing?

1160
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,928
- Yeah! Go, Smurfette!
- Whoo!

1161
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,324
Azrael, help! More power!

1162
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,921
What are we going to do?

1163
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,167
Bingo. We Smurfboard.

1164
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,808
Whoa!

1165
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,206
Team Smurf!

1166
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,805
Payback time.

1167
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,966
No!

1168
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,327
Smurfintine! Smurfintine!

1169
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,487
We're free!

1170
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,524
I'm okay. Yeah!

1171
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,650
I thought we were goners.

1172
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,404
All right. Everybody. Thank goodness.

1173
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,084
- All right!
- I'm okay!

1174
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,845
She did it! She did it!

1175
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,251
Where's Smurfette?

1176
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,161
Hey-

1177
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,441
Smurfette?

1178
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,926
What happened?

1179
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,682
This is what she once was.

1180
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,171
No. No, no, no.

1181
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,323
There's gotta be something I can do.
There's gotta be a spell.

1182
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,891
There's gotta be something.
I know there is.

1183
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,884
Where is it? What page? Must be here.

1184
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,123
"Alchemy, vanishing, lead into gold."
No, that's not it.

1185
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,202
- Papa.
- Which spell? Which spell?

1186
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,850
Papa.

1187
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,402
We won't find the answer to this in a book.

1188
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,810
Let's take her home.

1189
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,971
<i>I knew that I was different</i>

1190
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,169
<i>Didn't think you'd understand</i>

1191
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,164
<i>Nothing happens like you plan it</i>

1192
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,844
<i>Anyway</i>

1193
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,891
<i>Searching for a reason</i>

1194
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,406
<i>Guess I never really knew</i>

1195
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,171
<i>Where I belong</i>

1196
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,762
<i>I can see things clearly</i>

1197
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,844
<i>But it's time to say goodbye</i>

1198
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,446
<i>And it leaves me asking why</i>

1199
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,807
<i>It took so long</i>

1200
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,162
<i>I was always trying</i>

1201
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,130
<i>To find that special thing inside</i>

1202
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,841
<i>That made me strong</i>

1203
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,971
<i>Love is all I need</i>

1204
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,408
<i>It's where it all began</i>

1205
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,281
<i>You will always find</i> me

1206
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,850
<i>In your heart</i>

1207
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,811
<i>Oh</i>

1208
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:16,247
<i>I know that you can</i> see

1209
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,565
<i>Just who I really am</i>

1210
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,924
<i>And then you'll see</i>

1211
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,804
<i>I really do belong</i>

1212
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,166
She never thought she was a real Smurf.

1213
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,924
But she was the truest Smurf of all.

1214
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:34,324
Why is everyone crying?

1215
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,243
It's Smurfette.

1216
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,288
She's a lump of clay.

1217
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,682
No, Clumsy,
it's me. I'm right here.

1218
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,131
Smurfette?

1219
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,531
It's Smurfette. It's Smurfette!

1220
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,331
- Quiet, Clumsy.
- Let him be, Brainy.

1221
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,607
We all grieve in our own way.

1222
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,702
She's here!

1223
01:18:54,727 --> 01:18:57,470
Poor little bro. I know
how he feels.

1224
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,090
Yeah!

1225
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,321
Smurfette!

1226
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,324
Oh, Hefty, not you, too.

1227
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,970
You're all right!

1228
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,163
Don't ever do that to me again.

1229
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,527
I won't. I promise.

1230
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,445
Huh?

1231
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,925
Yes, yes, yes!

1232
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,405
You never cease to amaze me.

1233
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,324
<i>So, as for that burning question...</i>

1234
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,129
What's a Smurfette?

1235
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,283
Well, I don't need a book
to tell you she's...

1236
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,930
Right.

1237
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,243
Smurfette can't be defined
by just one word.

1238
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,845
She's many things.

1239
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,810
Oh, she doesn't know it yet,
but she's my new best friend.

1240
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,201
Smurfette is a bunny wrangler.

1241
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,805
She's tough.

1242
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,565
Not as tough as me, but tough enough.

1243
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:06,329
Smurfette can be anything she wants to be.

1244
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,327
<i>I talk with a mouth full, uh-huh</i>

1245
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,164
<i>But I couldn't be sweeter</i>

1246
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,243
<i>Yep, I'm a cutie in my own way</i>

1247
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,005
<i>I won't play follow the leader</i>

1248
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,161
<i>And I don't look like them</i>

1249
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,241
<i>But I ain't worried about it</i>

1250
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,401
<i>I don't talk like them</i>

1251
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,845
<i>But I ain't worried about it</i>

1252
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,400
<i>I know I'm a gem, I ain't worried about it</i>

1253
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,165
<i>I ain't worried about it, 'cause I'm a lady</i>

1254
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,050
<i>'Cause I'm a lady, hey!</i>

1255
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,727
<i>'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1256
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,808
<i>'Cause I'm a lady Come on</i>

1257
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,803
<i>I'm a, I'm a lady</i>

1258
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,211
<i>All my girls, show 'em you're a lady</i>

1259
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,771
<i>Tell the world</i>

1260
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,161
<i>Say you're proud to be a lady</i>

1261
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,487
<i>I know I laugh too loud</i>

1262
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,927
- What's going on in there?
- Goodbye!

1263
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,361
<i>To all those judgy eyes</i>

1264
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,488
<i>I got a whole lotta love</i>

1265
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,800
<i>'Cause I don't roll like them</i>

1266
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,325
<i>But I ain't worried about it</i>

1267
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,606
<i>I don't move like them</i>

1268
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,045
<i>But I ain't worried about it</i>

1269
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,485
<i>I know I'm a gem</i>

1270
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,806
<i>But I ain't worried about it</i>

1271
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,881
<i>I ain't worried about it</i>

1272
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,007
<i>'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1273
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,370
<i>'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1274
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,091
<i>- I'm a lady, yeah
- 'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1275
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,525
<i>'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1276
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,726
<i>Come on, come on</i>

1277
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,609
<i>I'm a, 'cause I'm a lady</i>

1278
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,921
<i>All my girls, show 'em you're a lady</i>

1279
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,606
<i>Tell the world, say
you're proud to be a lady</i>

1280
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,365
<i>All my girls, show 'em you're a lady</i>

1281
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,930
<i>Tell the world, say you're proud</i>

1282
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,411
<i>- To be a lady
- I'm a, I'm a lady</i>

1283
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,244
Say, "Blue cheese!"

1284
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,526
Blue cheese!

1285
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,602
<i>I talk with a mouth full, uh-huh</i>

1286
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,126
<i>But I couldn't be sweeter</i>

1287
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,362
<i>Yep, I'm a cutie in my own way</i>

1288
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,330
<i>I won't play follow the leader</i>

1289
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,481
<i>And I don't look like them</i>

1290
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,686
<i>But I ain't worried about it</i>

1291
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,040
<i>I don't talk like them</i>

1292
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,924
<i>I ain't worried about it</i>

1293
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,367
<i>I know I'm a gem, I ain't worried about it</i>

1294
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,091
<i>I ain't worried about it, 'cause I'm a lady</i>

1295
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,130
Hey!

1296
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,884
<i>'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1297
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,365
Come on!

1298
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,044
<i>I'm a, I'm a lady</i>

1299
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,681
<i>All my girls, show 'em you're a lady</i>

1300
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,321
<i>Tell the world, say
you're proud to be a lady</i>

1301
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,721
<i>I know I laugh too loud</i>

1302
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,804
<i>And I might cry too much, come on</i>

1303
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,531
<i>To all those judgy eyes</i>

1304
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,568
<i>I got a whole lotta love</i>

1305
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,926
<i>'Cause I don't roll like them</i>

1306
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,331
<i>But I ain't worried about it</i>

1307
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,731
<i>I don't move like them</i>

1308
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,001
<i>But I ain't worried about it</i>

1309
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,889
<i>I know I'm a gem</i>

1310
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,042
<i>I ain't worried about it
I ain't worried about it</i>

1311
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,849
<i>'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1312
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,410
<i>'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1313
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,284
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1314
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,489
<i>I'm a, 'cause I'm a lady</i>

1315
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,245
<i>All my girls, show 'em you're a lady</i>

1316
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,840
<i>Tell the world, say
you're proud to be a lady</i>

1317
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,526
<i>All my girls, show 'em you're a lady</i>

1318
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,886
<i>Tell the world, say you're proud</i>

1319
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,485
<i>I'm a lady</i>

1320
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,211
<i>And I'm pretty
I'm pretty cute and I'm pretty smart</i>

1321
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,931
<i>And when I break it down
It's a work of art</i>

1322
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,805
<i>And if you feel the same
Can you participate?</i>

1323
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,321
<i>I wanna see you shake
I wanna hear you say</i>

1324
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,051
<i>Say I'm pretty
I'm pretty cute and I'm pretty smart</i>

1325
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,930
<i>And when I break it down
It's a work of art</i>

1326
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,764
<i>'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1327
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,005
<i>'Cause I'm a lady</i>

1328
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:30,210
<i>Lady, lady, lady, lady</i>

1329
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,169
<i>I'm a, I'm a lady</i>

1330
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,891
<i>All my girls, show 'em you're a lady</i>

1331
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,486
<i>Tell the world, say
you're proud to be a lady</i>

1332
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,404
<i>All my girls, show 'em you're a lady</i>

1333
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,084
<i>Tell the world, say
you're proud to be a lady</i>

1334
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,611
<i>I'm a lady, lady</i>

1335
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,802
I was this close
to getting rid of the Smurfs,

1336
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,609
and you ruined everything.

1337
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,967
I knew I should have gotten a dog
from the shelter.

1338
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,922
I'm not saying this
to be cruel, okay?

1339
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,606
I'm saying it to be constructive.

1340
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,722
You're a useless feline.

1341
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,721
That's just mean. That's mean.
There was a line, and you crossed it.

1342
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:35,200
I was just jib-jabbing,
and you crossed that line, and that stung.

1343
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,645
I demand an apology.

1344
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,521
You were going to learn this
one way or another,

1345
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,649
but I am not your real father.

1346
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,725
But that doesn't matter now.
What matters is destroying the Smurfs.

1347
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,962
Any thoughts? I mean, I have thoughts.

1348
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,048
But I always like to spitball
off of your thoughts.

1349
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,246
Azrael, I'm not going to sugarcoat this.
Your ideas are terrible.

1350
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,282
I can't think with this music.

1351
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,170
Can someone please shut off the music?

1352
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:10,484
And what's with all these words
scrolling in front of me?

1353
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,683
Did the Smurfs do this
so that I would be distracted

1354
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,206
and not be able to destroy them as easily?

1355
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,644
"Matte painters"?
I don't even know what that means.

1356
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,210
Someone just made that up, right?

1357
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,891
I feel sorry for whoever "Matte" is.

1358
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,770
"Look development artists"?

1359
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,207
Oh, yes, of course, let's
develop some looks.

1360
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:35,047
Like maybe a really angry look,
because you two totally ruined my plans.

1361
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,204
Am I going mad, Azrael?

1362
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,329
For the last time,
get them to shut off this music!

1363
01:26:42,305 --> 01:27:42,293
