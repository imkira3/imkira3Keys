00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:14,679
No cigarettes, no sleep,
no light, no sound.

4
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:18,309
Nothing to eat...

5
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:21,304
No one to drink.

6
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:32,764
Sometimes all I need is the
air that I breathe and to love you.

7
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:38,554
All I need is the air that
I breathe and to love you.

8
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:40,713
All I need...

9
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:42,310
Watch where you're going, would ya?

10
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:54,995
Oh...

11
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:57,110
Hey!

12
00:02:58,663 --> 00:02:59,640
Hey!

13
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:05,306
Delta team, check in.

14
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:07,390
Delta team holding.

15
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:28,642
Maybe the source is wrong?

16
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:29,870
The source is good.

17
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:34,013
It's 10 after, the source
said 4 a.m. on the dot.

18
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,839
Wait!

19
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:41,649
Creedence.

20
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:45,424
It's probably just a radio station
someplace outside of the city.

21
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,972
No.

22
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:49,760
It's him.

23
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:12,444
Do we have to listen to the whole song,

24
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:15,740
all 7 minutes and 40 seconds of it?

25
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,194
Why do you insist on asking that every time?

26
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:21,726
Gum, I don't mess with your superstitions.

27
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:24,380
God knows we don't want to fluck with the formula.

28
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:26,444
But how about a new band?

29
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:31,882
Over the last six years we have listened to the
entire "Creedence Clearwater Revival" songbook

30
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:35,131
over and over and...

31
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:36,678
Hello?

32
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:37,657
Hi, Sweetie!

33
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:39,678
Why are you up so early?

34
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:41,962
What?

35
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:44,138
Which one?

36
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,772
Which one? Oh, the Care Bears book.

37
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,651
Oh, okay, I thought you were taking the even pages.

38
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:52,580
Oh, okay, I'm supposed to color the evens.

39
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,379
Oh, okay, well, I'll take my turn as soon as I get home.

40
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:58,888
Save the purple crayon for daddy.

41
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:03,514
Well, I told you, your daddy
has to work, but guess what?

42
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,800
When I get home I'm gonna make
you those... those happy-face pancakes

43
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:08,534
that you like so much, okay?

44
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,407
I love you, Baby.

45
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:12,433
Okay, big kiss.

46
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:17,885
Don't.

47
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,687
What?

48
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,761
Actually, you wouldn't understand.

49
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:23,162
About Care Bears?

50
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:24,722
Parenthood.

51
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:25,944
No, no, you're totally right.

52
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,955
Every father talks to his little
girl before he commits a class H felony.

53
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:32,510
Absolutely normal, so sweet.

54
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:35,214
Hoyt, it's late.

55
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:40,966
4 minutes - it's not late.

56
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:44,614
Sensors are reset in 20,
4 minutes less from 20 is 16.

57
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,515
2 to enter, 3 for the wall,

58
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:47,813
10 to drill...

59
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:51,874
That puts us inside of 15 minutes.
That's not enough cushion.

60
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:54,100
Let's call it.

61
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:57,500
Dude is runnin' 5 minutes behind.
He's probably just takin' a dump.

62
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:59,133
We're not callin' it, we're good.

63
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,412
This is an ace boon swipe dung.

64
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:04,195
There's not another one of these
in the headlights for a long while.

65
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:07,044
I don't know.

66
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,574
Suddenly I'm not feeling so good.

67
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:10,692
Well then, relax.

68
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:13,266
Put on a little "Bad Moon Rising."

69
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:15,021
This is a Diamond Dog.

70
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,056
I'm in the mainframe now.

71
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:18,722
The blouse is open.

72
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,796
Undoing the bra strap now.

73
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,052
Fire alarms are down.

74
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:24,670
<i>Seismics are down.</i>

75
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,645
<i>Killin' the cameras now.</i>

76
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,050
<i>Good to go when you are.</i>

77
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:30,421
<i>Go radio silent 'til I say.</i>

78
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:28,464
The van's leaving.

79
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:22,952
Okay, fellas, as ready to rock as Riley's Diaphragm.

80
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:24,822
Really, Hoyt?

81
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:26,226
Sorry, Sugar.

82
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:34,202
Sir, I've go seismics, sounds like it blew a wall.

83
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,335
We got 'em.

84
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,928
It doesn't make any sense, it's too easy.

85
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:44,951
This crew doesn't do too easy.

86
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:47,616
3 minutes, guys.

87
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:48,744
Okay, let's go.

88
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:49,983
Okay, get 'er up.

89
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:53,422
- That's 3! Let's go!
- Move it!

90
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,584
Dude! Come on!

91
00:08:56,504 --> 00:08:58,435
Okay, grab some extra stuff.

92
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,551
We're in tunnel now.

93
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,863
The proverbial hand is up the skirt,
headin' straight for the moose-knuckle.

94
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,858
Awesome.

95
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:29,796
That's why I love working with dudes.

96
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:33,545
It's all the clever variations you
can come up with for the word "vagina".

97
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,048
Vagina.

98
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:37,161
I need some air.

99
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:08,661
Drill's up. 3 minutes out.

100
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,438
They started drilling.

101
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:12,696
Wait... for my go.

102
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,306
Lock is out.

103
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:45,384
It's a go.

104
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:47,040
All right. We'll 'em.

105
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:08,291
Come on now, master at work.

106
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:18,323
You got 30 seconds.

107
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:19,846
Plenty of time.

108
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,951
Number 1's down.

109
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:27,885
You only got 15 seconds, come on.

110
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:30,767
Number 2, down.

111
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:34,781
Go!

112
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:40,589
- Clear!
- Clear!

113
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,485
What the hell's goin' on?

114
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:47,282
It doesn't make any sense.

115
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,013
They were casing this place for 3 weeks.

116
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:52,333
Seth! Get someone in that toy store!

117
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:53,706
Now!

118
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:58,077
We're in.

119
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,628
They're in the bank vault, Baby,
2 minutes until we're rich.

120
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:11,094
Jesus! Right!

121
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:14,179
It's like looking into heaven.

122
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,407
Stay focused!

123
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:18,924
Coming up on creepy toy store now.

124
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:20,966
<i>- Clear.
- Clear.</i>

125
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:22,033
<i>All clear.</i>

126
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:24,942
<i>Scary wall can't be now.</i>

127
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:29,469
<i>Common stage has not been breached.
Repeat, secondary the wall is intact.</i>

128
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:31,831
You know, I like bright, shiny things, Gummer.

129
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,519
This is the oldest and bright, shiny thing.

130
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:39,297
How much weight can you carry? Each one
of those bars weights 27 and a half pounds!

131
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:41,097
I played football

132
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,870
We got our 10 million right here.

133
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,988
Time!

134
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:53,805
Sir, I've got 500 meters of dark,
empty tunnel in front of me.

135
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,127
Somebody screwed up.

136
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,352
We're on the wrong block.

137
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:58,888
They're robbing the bank!

138
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:00,787
- Quick!
- Go! Go! Go!

139
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:19,130
Let's do it!

140
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,558
Bring that friggin' gear over here!

141
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,792
Get rid of the store!

142
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:51,453
Let's go! Let's go!

143
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:56,351
Go, go, go, go!!!

144
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:57,590
Open the door!

145
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,619
Let's go, Guys, c'mon, move it, let's go!

146
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,150
Go, go, go, go!!

147
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:13,739
...be in the vault!

148
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:22,135
Hey, what are you young fellas doing?

149
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:26,786
Just get moving!

150
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:30,748
- Did you have to hit him so hard?
- He saw our faces!

151
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:32,609
No. Put it down! No homicides!

152
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:34,579
No, I am not going back to prison, not again.

153
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:38,955
Fuck! In this bag for us to disappear,
no need for anymore jobs. Let's just go!

154
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:46,156
Come on, guys.
What the hell are they doing!

155
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,651
Damn!

156
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:52,901
I have been to prison, and I didn't like it.

157
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,881
In fact, I fuckin' hated it!

158
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:01,778
Oh, shit!

159
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:05,570
You shot me!

160
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:07,233
Let's find the back of this place.

161
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:10,976
Oh, my God!

162
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:12,948
Keep quiet!

163
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:14,883
What are you doing?

164
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:18,086
- What happened?
- Shawn shot me in the leg.

165
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:20,278
No, you shot me!

166
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:21,569
Oh, shit!

167
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,640
I left the money, I have to get the money!

168
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,614
What? No! We're heated!

169
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,488
Let's go, guys, come on, move it, let's go!

170
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:34,670
God!

171
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:36,009
This sucks!

172
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:42,322
I want this guy nailed!
Now everyone spread out!

173
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:49,680
- What the hell are you doing?
- He's on his own now, Baby.

174
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:50,998
No, Will!

175
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:52,980
Your rider's gone.

176
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,988
Hoyt! Hoyt!

177
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:04,619
Put your hands in the air!

178
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:08,818
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

179
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,439
All units, 217 on east side of Rampart.

180
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,938
Assault on 2 police officers.

181
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:41,864
Suspect has fled the scene of the police cruiser.

182
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:43,052
Oh, we got 'im!

183
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,400
There he is, straight ahead.

184
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:48,178
All units, Operaville and Burgundy.

185
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:11,376
On the upward ramp!

186
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:40,972
Shit!

187
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:45,568
God damn it!

188
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:12,067
Man! Don't shoot!

189
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:13,339
Get out of the way!

190
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:39,849
Bring out the money and yourself...slow.

191
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:41,870
Real slow.

192
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:52,982
Stop.
Turn around.

193
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:56,637
On your knees.

194
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:03,709
My wedding day.
The birth of my twins.

195
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:09,826
And now this.
Highlightsville. Fuckin' highlights.

196
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,617
Cuff him!

197
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:17,089
Hey! Where's the money?

198
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,961
Fletcher, you're doing well.

199
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,444
Hope you were raped every day.

200
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,312
Harlend wants to give you a lift.

201
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,855
He's not asking.

202
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:48,750
- Welcome home.
- Harlend.

203
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:55,625
- So, where to?
- Coronado and Prentiss.

204
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,230
So, how's the Federal penal system?

205
00:22:10,423 --> 00:22:11,969
Not as tough as they say, huh?

206
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:15,804
- How's the wife?
- She's good.

207
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,157
- I guess.
- She left you?

208
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,796
- Four years ago.
- I'm sorry.

209
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:27,720
You ought to be.

210
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:30,853
Why did you pick me up, Harlend?

211
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,692
I thought you might pick up
where you left off.

212
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:39,397
- Now that you're free as a bird.
- Well, that's all behind me now.

213
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:44,999
You can probably afford to retire now with that
sizable withdrawal from Parish Community you made.

214
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:48,571
You knew, you got caught with that money,
you'd be lookin' at an extra 10 years,

215
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:51,947
so you ditched it somewhere.
And now that you're out,

216
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:56,953
I thought you'd go and get that 10 mill.
Aren't you, Will?

217
00:22:57,066 --> 00:23:01,049
Much like a squirrel returning back to his
hoard after a long cold winter.

218
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:04,141
I'm not the squirrel playing
with his nuts here, Harlend.

219
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:06,449
I don't have the money.

220
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:09,599
You know that Vincent is dead, right?

221
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:16,215
I don't think he knows.
Do you, Agent Fletcher?

222
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:18,942
How does that make you feel?

223
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:23,279
He was my friend.

224
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,300
Yeah.

225
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:27,148
He had a tough time of it
after you left.

226
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:30,182
You being the brains behind the operation.

227
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,209
I guess he owed money to the wrong people.

228
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,100
Your ex-wife's place, huh?

229
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:46,846
- I'm not here for her.
- Do you really think your kid wants to see you?

230
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:49,969
I'm about to find out.

231
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:53,480
Grandma Harlend used to say,
"Love makes time pass,

232
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:55,704
but time is certain to make love pass."

233
00:23:57,707 --> 00:24:01,533
Can I enjoy my day now?
Thanks for the lift.

234
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:05,326
Oh, Happy Fat Tuesday, Will.

235
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:15,222
I'm starting to think you liked the guy.

236
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,760
Admiring someone doesn't
mean you like him.

237
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:19,668
Let's go, Fletcher.

238
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:31,817
- What are you doing? You scared me.
- I'm sorry. It's okay.

239
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,151
I'm sorry.

240
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,263
- When did you get out?
- This morning.

241
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:41,257
I know I should have called,
I didn't have the number.

242
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,753
You look like your mom.
She's not here, is she?

243
00:24:45,474 --> 00:24:46,829
She's in Shreveport.

244
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:50,228
- With Mr. Loeb?
- Yes, with David.

245
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:58,472
This came for you this morning,
it was just left on the mat.

246
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:00,665
Thanks. Can we talk?

247
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:03,619
- I really should get going.
- Just for a few minutes.

248
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:16,997
I have something for you, I saw it
on the way in, reminded me of you.

249
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:29,299
Cool.

250
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,823
No one sets-out to be a criminal.

251
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:37,518
But through...
But through...

252
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:44,002
I've had so many conversations with you,
now that you're...

253
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,181
sitting across from me,

254
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,094
it's like my mind's going blank.

255
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,378
No one sets-out to be a criminal, Alison.

256
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:09,134
But through circumstances,
bad choices, needs...

257
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:14,466
unfor... unforeseeable obstacles,
unreliable friends,

258
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:16,880
dishonesty, life intervenes.

259
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,506
I not trying to justify it,
I'm not making excuses for it.

260
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:27,445
I was a bad man,
but I've... I've had eight long years

261
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:29,787
to get rid of that man.

262
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:32,855
To ready myself.

263
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:36,467
To get to know you.

264
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,599
I have to go.

265
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:54,916
- Where are you going?
- I told you, I'm late.

266
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,447
- Late for what?
- My shrink session.

267
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:01,921
- I go every Tuesday.
- Really?

268
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:09,045
Yeah, apparently I have abandonment issues.
Go figure.

269
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:17,236
I meant what I said, Alison.

270
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,516
Keep it!
I'm not seven anymore.

271
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:41,793
-Alison.
- Just go, please.

272
00:28:18,853 --> 00:28:20,834
Thanks for the visual massage, Pete.

273
00:28:20,893 --> 00:28:25,149
Riley, you are just too damn fine, girl.
And you don't give me the time of day.

274
00:28:25,557 --> 00:28:28,182
How 'bout you call your wife and
see when you're available.

275
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:33,664
Ah, why do you gotta bring her up?
Talk about a buzz-kill. You have a good one.

276
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:35,118
You too.

277
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,867
How is it that after eight years
you have only gotten younger?

278
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:46,571
Oh, God, Will!
I can't believe it.

279
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,583
- When did you get out?
- This morning.

280
00:28:49,682 --> 00:28:51,679
You should have let me know,
I woulda come to pick you up.

281
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:54,560
It's all right, Agent Harlend was
kind enough to give me a lift.

282
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,422
You're kidding!
God, that guy needs to get laid like yesterday!

283
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:04,494
- Let me get you a drink. Tequila?
- Yes, ma'am.

284
00:29:05,764 --> 00:29:08,918
What the hell, Riley, you're
working in a cop bar?

285
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,825
Yeah, well, you know, it's a good way
to guarantee I don't go back to wrong.

286
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,377
"Back to wrong"?

287
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:17,449
Yeah, self-restraint was never my strong suit.

288
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,809
I'm honored to be your first stop.

289
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:30,262
- Actually I dropped by Alison's first.
- Ooh! And how is she?

290
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:34,267
Not as honored.

291
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:38,737
Don't worry, Will, she'll come 'round.
I missed you, Will.

292
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:42,307
You know, I never got to thank
you after all that with Vin.

293
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:43,346
Don't mention it.

294
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,611
I wasn't allowed to come visit,
my lawyer wouldn't let me, and um...

295
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:51,891
- Harlend never really stopped sniffing around.
- I know, I know.

296
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:56,263
But you not ratting us out,
really means something to me, Will.

297
00:29:57,303 --> 00:29:58,184
Like I said...

298
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:01,975
You coulda ratted-out Hoyt though,
that I wouldn't have minded.

299
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:06,017
Which... yeah, yeah,
I'm looking for that guy.

300
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,408
And I take it you heard about Vince?

301
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:14,592
- Yeah, it's terrible.
- Yeah, I mean he went really dark.

302
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:19,909
Well, I mean, do they know who killed him?

303
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:23,467
No, I don't think so, He was hangin'
out with a sketchy crowd, you know.

304
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:29,489
- Looking for the new "you" I suppose.
- It's good to see you again, Riley.

305
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:38,448
I think we woke-up your package.

306
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:45,499
Riley, give Jake a tap.

307
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,342
- Two beers.
- Be right back.

308
00:30:58,574 --> 00:30:59,266
Hello.

309
00:30:59,665 --> 00:31:01,998
<i>Hello, Will Montgomery.</i>

310
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:08,651
Who is this?

311
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:12,880
<i>You don't recognize my voice, Gum?</i>

312
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:15,450
<i>Yeah, I wanted to be
there for ya at the prison.</i>

313
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:16,401
Vincent?

314
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:20,379
<i>Give you a welcome you when you got out,
but you know how it is, time just slipped away.</i>

315
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:25,369
Well, Hallelujah, man, you're alive.
Shit! You know what?

316
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:27,168
Everybody's tellin' me you're dead.

317
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:31,462
<i>Well, that depends on how you're
interpretation of the word "dead".</i>

318
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:34,117
<i>I'm clearly not "living".</i>

319
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,346
Where are you, can we meet?
How are you?

320
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,474
The years you've been gone
have not been kind to me, Gum.

321
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,411
Constantly running from loan sharks, the Feds.

322
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:49,702
<i>Broker than a dead-dick dog
that couldn't get another swipe.</i>

323
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:53,796
- I AM sorry to hear about that.
- You listen to me, Gum.

324
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:58,151
- I have waited eight years for this.
- Go ahead.

325
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,886
I had to change my name,
erase everything.

326
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:03,815
And then, that little matter
of the bullet in my leg.

327
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,578
A constant, friendly reminder

328
00:32:05,605 --> 00:32:08,397
<i>of the partner who
ruined my life that night.</i>

329
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:11,083
Come on, man! Really, we gonna go back there?

330
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:13,195
- You did that to yourself.
- Semantics.

331
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:17,102
I want my share! I want MY share

332
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:18,793
<i>of the 10 million dollars</i>

333
00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:20,890
<i>that was going to
change our lives forever.</i>

334
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:22,956
Vinny, there is no cash.

335
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:29,054
I had a feeling you'd say that, Gum.

336
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:32,468
I burned it just before
Harlend got to me.

337
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,764
No. Stop it!

338
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:36,615
<i>It's true.</i>

339
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,996
- What's taking so long?
- Hold on.

340
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:42,201
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

341
00:32:42,204 --> 00:32:43,625
<i>Who... who..</i>

342
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,360
- that voice, who is that?
- That's right, you don't know.

343
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:48,674
I'm a cab driver now.

344
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,387
My fare is this sweet little girl
trying to get to her shrink's office

345
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:55,454
so she can discuss her "daddy issues"

346
00:32:55,495 --> 00:33:01,112
and how they have manifested into
an unhealthy disdain for the world at large.

347
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,401
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hold on, please, Gum.

348
00:33:05,747 --> 00:33:09,737
All right, Miss, terrible Fat Tuesday traffic.
Be there in a jiffy.

349
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,376
See how it lays?

350
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:19,635
<i>Now, Gum, it all depends on whether or not you're
gonna stick to your story about the burnt cash.</i>

351
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:23,530
You touch her and I'll take you down
the Levy and kick your fuckin' ass.

352
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:28,731
I don't know if you heard what I just said,
but this all depends on you.

353
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:31,331
VINCENT!

354
00:33:40,307 --> 00:33:41,303
He's on the move.

355
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:56,270
Where are we going?

356
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:10,524
- What are we doing, why are we in here?
- I hope you understand this is not my preference.

357
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:16,397
Help me! No! Help!

358
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:19,658
I'm considering your father
an elemental end to your suffering.

359
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:26,756
But you see, Alison,
I've got a sickness.

360
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:28,466
I'm not well.

361
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:33,395
Your father abandoned me in my time of need

362
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:37,871
so I know what it is to
to be in the position you're in.

363
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:43,667
Really, I do. I know what it is to be
left high and dry by Will Montgomery.

364
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:47,829
And you and me...we are kindred spirits.

365
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,893
And I am going to make him pay for the both of us.

366
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:05,031
Relax!

367
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:14,483
Where's Alison?

368
00:35:14,557 --> 00:35:17,565
Did you change your mind or are you
still sticking with that bullshit story?

369
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,573
Can I talk to her?

370
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,907
Alison.

371
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:23,510
She's waiting for you to decide
whether she's going to remain fine.

372
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:25,697
Vincent, don't do this.

373
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,145
I'm  hangin' up now.

374
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:32,328
No, no! Wait! Okay! Wait! I can get it.

375
00:35:32,794 --> 00:35:35,402
<i>I can get the money. I just need time.</i>

376
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:37,133
<i>It's not here.</i>

377
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:40,522
It's in Tuscaloosa, my lawyer has it.

378
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:43,674
In a truck, so I need 24 hours.

379
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:45,565
You got 12.

380
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:49,340
<i>A phone in your hand. I'll be
tracking you with it at all times.</i>

381
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,594
8 rings! 8 rings and you pick it up!

382
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:55,974
You miss a single phone call from me, Alison doesn't live.

383
00:35:55,975 --> 00:35:56,656
Vincent.

384
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,900
This is my last chance to
to dance, Buddy.

385
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,869
You haven't seen me recently.
Let's just say I've got 2 left feet.

386
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,879
<i>Hello. Vincent!</i>

387
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,413
Hello.

388
00:36:57,768 --> 00:37:01,209
- I need to get a phone.
- I'm sorry, Sir, you're gonna have to wait.

389
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:04,567
- Excuse me, Ma'am, I really need a phone.
- Sir, I will be with you in a moment.

390
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,852
- How much is this one?
- 29.99.

391
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,297
Want your change?

392
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:26,946
Passenger service to Tuscaloosa
now boarding platform 2.

393
00:38:25,823 --> 00:38:28,408
Help, get me out of here.

394
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:41,401
Fletcher, I can't hear you.

395
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:45,521
You lost him on his first morning out. Shit!

396
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:49,670
- Will Montgomery is here for you.
- Send him in.

397
00:38:52,072 --> 00:38:54,773
So your dead, former partner Vincent Kinsey

398
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,309
has kidnapped your daughter and
is holding her somewhere in New Orleans?

399
00:38:57,363 --> 00:38:59,880
- In a cab.
- The cab, yes, that's right. In the cab, yeah.

400
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:01,332
And what does he want in return?

401
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,939
- 10 Million dollars.
- 10 Million dollars.

402
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:10,801
- Remind me why that's a familiar figure.
- I burned the cash.

403
00:39:15,651 --> 00:39:20,946
Just before you grabbed me.
That's the God's honest truth.

404
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:23,871
'Cause I knew I'd get less
time if I ditched the money.

405
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:28,924
I don't have it but he has my daughter
and I need your help.

406
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:33,396
Why would I be here if I had the money?

407
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,433
I would just pay Vincent off and
get my little girl back.

408
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:36,957
This is how I see it, Will.

409
00:39:37,231 --> 00:39:41,780
You're a thief, a crook and a scumbag,
but you're also a very clever tree frog.

410
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:46,156
So you concoct this "Kinsey is alive and
has snatched my kid" fantasy

411
00:39:46,193 --> 00:39:50,828
so that A, you can show that you don't have the
money otherwise why wouldn't you pay the ransom,

412
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:56,743
or B, send us running around all over town
searching for your daughter and her abductor

413
00:39:56,836 --> 00:39:59,715
to afford you the time to dig-up the dough

414
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:03,214
and jump onto a cigarette boat
and zip-down to the Bahamas

415
00:40:03,293 --> 00:40:06,108
where you can sip rum for the rest of your days

416
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:09,127
and listen to classic rock

417
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:13,219
played by bands with muscular guitarists
and dead drummers.

418
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,025
Ah, my faithful buddy.

419
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:21,987
Couldn't find a couch in the living room.

420
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:25,748
This is Vincent's file.

421
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,703
The prints match as you can see.

422
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:31,689
They cut his body up before they burnt it.

423
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:36,207
We managed to get the prints of
a few fingers that survived the fire.

424
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:40,479
- We can visit his grave if you want.
- No, we can't

425
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:42,667
because he's alive. He faked his own death.

426
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:47,060
Please, Tim, I'm running out of time.

427
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,669
I'm not being played by you again, Will.

428
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,389
All right, let's go.

429
00:40:58,665 --> 00:40:59,971
Please help me.

430
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,529
Escort our pal out of the building, will ya?

431
00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:07,841
A little help, guys.

432
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:12,390
Will Montgomery, on behalf of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation

433
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:14,166
I'd like to thank you for stopping by today.

434
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:17,741
Hold up, hold up.

435
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:30,998
Harlend thinks you're some
kind of criminal mastermind.

436
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:32,291
A criminal mastermind?

437
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,213
I don't share this belief because criminal
masterminds don't go away for eight year jolts.

438
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:37,984
Or do they?

439
00:42:00,032 --> 00:42:01,209
One more, please.

440
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:05,563
Thank you.

441
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:13,322
We called Montgomery's ex home and cell.
Both voicemails say she's out of town.

442
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,134
Have you tried his
daughter's cell phone?

443
00:42:19,148 --> 00:42:22,680
Right, it says the account's been suspended
2 weeks per request of the stepfather.

444
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,607
I think I'll call local PD on it.

445
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:31,308
If she has been kidnapped,
we're FBI, we do something about it.

446
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,056
- You don't think he's telling the truth?
- No, I do not.

447
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:03,569
Hey! Is there anybody out there?

448
00:43:13,484 --> 00:43:14,370
Jacobs.

449
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:18,111
Crap.

450
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:30,390
We have a problem.

451
00:43:53,274 --> 00:43:56,506
That's good.
All right, well, keep trackin' 'im to Tuscaloosa.

452
00:43:56,648 --> 00:43:59,020
If he deviates from the route
let me know.

453
00:44:24,443 --> 00:44:28,651
You're are exactly the woman
I want to see in clothes that tight.

454
00:44:35,526 --> 00:44:39,936
The only thing with any balls to
cover this town was The Hurricane.

455
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:42,933
Get away from the car!

456
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:47,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, cab's off duty.

457
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:52,032
G'day, Mate, how ya doin'?
Look, look, I just gotta get to the...

458
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:53,357
The cab's off duty, man.

459
00:44:53,362 --> 00:44:56,739
Yeah, Mate?. I just gotta catch
up with these chicks that I met...

460
00:44:56,843 --> 00:44:57,512
Hey!

461
00:44:57,548 --> 00:45:01,026
Please? Good on ya, Mate.

462
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:05,501
Help.

463
00:45:11,236 --> 00:45:13,519
I haven't had my dong a dip since I got here, eh.

464
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:25,846
One of them was preg as heck.
Yeah, I know.

465
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:31,524
Mate, I better get of this blow.
This cabby's gonna chuck a wobbly.

466
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:36,177
All right, Mate, so, let me tell
you about those sheilas, eh.

467
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:39,838
So, the pregnant one is sayin
nice things to ya, I really don't know why.

468
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:42,986
But made me realize a guy that
was violent cab on a kit plant race.

469
00:45:43,883 --> 00:45:48,063
What the hell, the chicks are quite
different in New Orleans, eh, Mate?

470
00:45:48,156 --> 00:45:50,689
New Orleans, it all comes back.

471
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:55,010
Heard you kid by the name King Louis 15?

472
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,103
King Louis 15 he don't know all this.

473
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:03,715
- Frenchman to cross the ocean to visit.
- It wasn't happening.

474
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,735
So in order to get some use out of it

475
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:10,289
finally he starts shippin' over
boatloads of French prisoners.

476
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,856
That was coal up your ass, bugger.

477
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:19,472
Thieves, gamblers, prostitutes, murderers,
pirates, gypsies, pickpockets.

478
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:22,812
and psychopaths.

479
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,232
Is this me stop?

480
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:35,443
Those were the pioneers of this land.

481
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:40,980
And the forefathers of this town.

482
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:45,023
That you so casually dismissed.

483
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:14,030
All computers in this building are tracked.

484
00:47:14,113 --> 00:47:18,339
This is the page that corresponds to the
exact moment in the video where he stops.

485
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:26,253
This is Agent Harlend, I need an assault
team at Apartment 9, 23 St. Claude.

486
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,824
Ya hear me! Shut up, stupid, stupid dog.

487
00:47:48,114 --> 00:47:50,782
I'm gonna skin you and make
a pair of shoes out of you.

488
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:55,514
I hate you and your owner.
Shut up.

489
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:02,072
- Jesus, Will!
- Shut up. Drop the bag.

490
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:05,010
That's my lunch.

491
00:48:05,046 --> 00:48:08,720
- And that's my gun.
- Drop the bag.

492
00:48:15,116 --> 00:48:17,548
That's for the last ten years.

493
00:48:21,324 --> 00:48:24,684
- Where's Vincent?
- Vincent? Vincent's dead, man.

494
00:48:26,285 --> 00:48:29,397
- Try again.
- I swear, I swear on my life.

495
00:48:29,432 --> 00:48:30,160
I haven't seen Vincent...

496
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:33,239
Oh, that's right, I forgot, it's
not your brains you care about.

497
00:48:34,157 --> 00:48:38,282
A bullet to the stomach is the most painful.
And it takes hours to die.

498
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:41,260
Okay, look, look, look,
Mate, what do you want to know?

499
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:43,016
What does he have you doing?

500
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:46,949
Nothing, baby, gee, you know,
bags drops, recons, stuff like that.

501
00:48:46,994 --> 00:48:49,528
He told me to drop off the phone
for you so I dropped off the phone.

502
00:48:49,618 --> 00:48:52,285
And my daughter? My daughter?!?

503
00:48:52,826 --> 00:48:55,777
You know, the whole bottom fell out of
our operation when you went away, Will.

504
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:57,989
I mean, look around you, does it look
like I'm puttin' on the Ritz here?

505
00:48:58,077 --> 00:49:00,481
We want our share, just our share.

506
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:11,277
So help me God, Hoyt, you tell me where she is,
or I'll blow your lunch all over this carpet.

507
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:16,856
He's  drivin' around with her,
in the trunk of his cab.

508
00:49:17,117 --> 00:49:20,504
- In the trunk?
- And I gotta be honest with you, Will, 'cause

509
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,124
I didn't think the taking of
your daughter part was right.

510
00:49:23,286 --> 00:49:28,280
I mean, bad idea to steal from
America's greatest bank robber.

511
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:39,952
After he had lost the leg,
something changed in him, Will.

512
00:49:40,536 --> 00:49:44,173
He said he just felt numb to
everything, numb like a statue.

513
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:49,536
And he blames that on you, Will.
He blames the leg on you,

514
00:49:49,581 --> 00:49:52,983
so he also blames the numb on you.

515
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,545
Go.

516
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:45,110
Let the squirrels squabble,
then we'll go after their hoard.

517
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:54,579
Hold it!

518
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:10,119
Let's go!

519
00:51:22,351 --> 00:51:26,204
Will, stop.

520
00:52:05,142 --> 00:52:06,970
Street level! Go!.

521
00:52:18,645 --> 00:52:21,159
What the hell are you doing?

522
00:52:21,248 --> 00:52:23,577
Man, are you listening, tapioca?

523
00:52:24,143 --> 00:52:26,033
Just go, please.

524
00:52:27,503 --> 00:52:28,775
Medallion.

525
00:53:47,856 --> 00:53:50,822
License and registration, please.

526
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:54,436
Do you know why I pulled you over?

527
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,071
- I do not.
- Your brake light's out.

528
00:54:00,146 --> 00:54:02,365
- What's funny?
- Nothing, it's just...

529
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:06,058
it's Mardi Gras, and the streets
are filled with drunken lunatics

530
00:54:06,147 --> 00:54:09,587
and you pull me over for a broke, brake light.

531
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,450
Help.

532
00:54:12,114 --> 00:54:15,016
That reminds me of my father
who's dying of bone cancer.

533
00:54:15,145 --> 00:54:19,607
all day he'd bitch about the nick he
got on his chin from shaving that morning.

534
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:24,301
I know what you're thinking:
Why would a dying man shave?

535
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:28,700
No, I wasn't thinking that at all.

536
00:54:28,734 --> 00:54:31,849
Get this vehicle back to the barn
and get that light taken care of.

537
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,049
Please, can you hear me?

538
00:54:38,085 --> 00:54:40,471
Because he had tremendous vanity.

539
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:47,848
Sir, you mind coming around
here and open the trunk?

540
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:55,484
He did not go gently, my father.
He screamed a lot.

541
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:59,310
The pain was agonizing, searing.

542
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:05,053
- Eels squirming through his veins.
- Buddy, I don't really give a damn.

543
00:55:46,945 --> 00:55:52,085
Somebody help me.

544
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:54,934
Somebody please help me.

545
00:55:56,964 --> 00:56:00,326
C'mon, you look more like him than I thought.

546
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:02,688
- No.
- You don't remember me?

547
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,705
You were young, Princess,
and I did look a little different.

548
00:56:05,754 --> 00:56:09,163
I had all my fingers then and both legs.

549
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:13,628
Nice fingers, sweetie.

550
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:16,688
You know that the FBI, they use these
little lines in order to find people.

551
00:56:16,776 --> 00:56:18,567
Until they were looking for me, anyway.

552
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:22,122
But, one day, I came up with a plan.

553
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,004
Yeah, I dug up a body, see, it wasn't hard,
the resemblance was reasonable.

554
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:31,480
Then I cut him up into small pieces,
and added a little bit of myself to the mix.

555
00:56:31,566 --> 00:56:36,545
I was a Golden Boy, dollface,
now I'm a freakin' Picasso.

556
00:56:41,757 --> 00:56:44,211
And don't ever mess with my lights again.

557
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:53,044
What are you looking at, shrimp?

558
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:02,545
Listen, brother, take the cab, take the money and
take the cab, I don't give a crap, but don't take me.

559
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:03,885
- What is this?
- It's a meter.

560
00:57:03,964 --> 00:57:06,876
No, I know what a meter is, asshole.
Not that, this.

561
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,748
This, GPS, everyone has 'em,
in case the cars are stolen.

562
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,337
- Tells you their location?
- Within a few blocks, yes.

563
00:57:12,425 --> 00:57:14,215
Okay, call your dispatch.

564
00:57:15,549 --> 00:57:19,625
Man, you have got to clean out that backseat,
before you sign-off tonight.

565
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:24,084
Yesterday I had to put on a biohazard suit,
hip-waders, and rubber gloves

566
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:26,967
and I got the garden hoe and
scraped that crap outta there.

567
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:31,824
Looked like boogers or jalapeno jelly, asshole.

568
00:57:32,342 --> 00:57:35,017
- I got a question for you.
- 9 inches.

569
00:57:35,071 --> 00:57:37,713
And it can reload after 14 minutes and a tickle.

570
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:38,736
<i>What else do you want to know?</i>

571
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:40,163
About the driver.

572
00:57:40,215 --> 00:57:43,713
<i>Is this about me docking you pay
again on account that fender-bender,</i>

573
00:57:43,801 --> 00:57:46,914
the same policy applies for
everybody and I ain't lippin'

574
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:52,919
- No, it's not about that.
- A white guy with a fake leg.

575
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,252
- It is a white man with a fake leg.
- Maybe missing some fingers.

576
00:57:56,634 --> 00:57:58,176
- Really?
- Tell him.

577
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:00,006
And maybe missing some fingers.

578
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:03,292
Are you messin' with me today?

579
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:04,886
<i>Whatchya want him fo?</i>

580
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:06,460
He cuts me off at the light.

581
00:58:06,509 --> 00:58:08,085
<i>You think I give a snot, huh?</i>

582
00:58:08,134 --> 00:58:10,671
Tell him he's stealing money,
you saw him pocketing fares.

583
00:58:10,802 --> 00:58:14,090
- He's stealin' fares, pocketed.
- Wait!

584
00:58:14,134 --> 00:58:19,044
<i>Are you saying that this creepy, limpin' bastard
be runnin' around snitchin' my dough.</i>

585
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,757
- Get his location.
- Where is he right now?

586
00:58:21,842 --> 00:58:26,508
- Whatchya wanna know dat fo?
- I confront him for you, get the truth.

587
00:58:30,428 --> 00:58:34,211
- You would do that for me, Bertrand?
- You're a good boss.

588
00:58:37,678 --> 00:58:38,898
In the French Quarter,

589
00:58:39,092 --> 00:58:40,511
<i>Bugundy and St. Philip.</i>

590
00:58:40,722 --> 00:58:45,505
- Thank you.
- Well done, get his medallion number.

591
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:48,290
- And his medallion number.
- Man.

592
00:58:48,342 --> 00:58:52,123
He a freaky disk, dis guy, you best
be careful there, Berty Boy.

593
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:55,332
- Get out
- It's all yours, brother.

594
00:58:57,782 --> 00:59:00,563
<i>It's 5-KILO-2-0.</i>

595
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:02,626
Again, that's 5-K-20.

596
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:04,463
Thanks, pal.

597
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:09,842
Lookie here, did you just turn
white on me all of a sudden?

598
00:59:09,885 --> 00:59:11,377
Who dat is?

599
01:00:03,073 --> 01:00:07,422
Do you remember where we dropped off Montgomery?
His daughter's address.

600
01:00:07,513 --> 01:00:10,805
- Yeah, it's Coronado and something.
- Prentiss.

601
01:00:11,555 --> 01:00:16,194
Boss, we got a matching Montgomery's
description just jacked a cab 5 blocks from here.

602
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,666
Get this, the cabby said he was sweating about
a guy missing a leg and his fingers.

603
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:23,377
The tracking is throwing the
cab back into the Quarter.

604
01:01:53,348 --> 01:01:55,217
- Don't hurt me, man.
- Who's cab is this?

605
01:01:55,268 --> 01:01:58,349
It's mine, but that ain't my number.

606
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,592
Open the trunk.

607
01:02:03,392 --> 01:02:05,100
There he is, we got him.

608
01:02:07,518 --> 01:02:09,920
What, that's someone else's GPS.

609
01:02:11,726 --> 01:02:14,549
Montgomery!
Put your god damned knees on the ground.

610
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:17,723
Will Montgomery you are under
arrest for violation of parole,

611
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:21,970
illegally accessing confidential
FBI records, assaulting a federal agent,

612
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:23,800
and resisting arrest.

613
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:27,181
- We're bringin' him back now.
- You gotta listen to me.

614
01:02:27,226 --> 01:02:29,763
- No, we don't.
- He's going to kill her.

615
01:02:29,808 --> 01:02:33,970
Oh, it's a neat story, Vincent Kinsey
has come back from the dead. Yeah.

616
01:02:36,556 --> 01:02:39,889
Hey, if I were comin' back from the dead
it wouldn't be for daughter killin',

617
01:02:39,975 --> 01:02:43,757
it'd be to go to Rick's Cabaret
to see some naked ladies.

618
01:02:45,393 --> 01:02:48,092
- I gotta take that.
- Ah, ya want me to take a message?

619
01:02:48,187 --> 01:02:51,930
- I've got only eight rings to pick up that call.
- Hey, hey, sit back.

620
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,558
Hello?

621
01:03:34,226 --> 01:03:36,551
I'm here.

622
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:43,324
I'm here.

623
01:03:43,478 --> 01:03:46,221
You're really comin' down to the
wire on this one, eh, Gum?

624
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,636
We're gonna have trouble getting out of your pocket?

625
01:03:49,603 --> 01:03:52,599
I'm not, I just... I just...

626
01:03:52,687 --> 01:03:54,303
Sounds like you're out of breath.

627
01:03:54,476 --> 01:03:55,938
<i>Tell me something, Gum.</i>

628
01:03:56,021 --> 01:03:58,307
What's the scenery like down there in Tuscaloosa?

629
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,468
I always wanted to take that ride along the Gulf.

630
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:02,060
I don't have it.

631
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:06,227
And better yet, why don't you tell me how Hoyt's
doing since that's where you were anyway.

632
01:04:06,315 --> 01:04:07,855
I don't have the money.

633
01:04:08,856 --> 01:04:10,976
What did I say to you about lying to me?

634
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:13,814
I'm sorry, I just... I just...

635
01:04:13,855 --> 01:04:17,228
- Your daughter's dead.
- No, wait, wait!

636
01:04:18,895 --> 01:04:20,602
You really don't have it, do you?

637
01:04:22,188 --> 01:04:24,683
- I'll get you the money.
- Good.

638
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,349
May I ask how?

639
01:04:30,312 --> 01:04:32,220
We're going back to "wrong".

640
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:45,561
You got a real 40 went down the alley,
okay, we gotta set-up a perimeter.

641
01:04:45,897 --> 01:04:47,306
Move! Clear out!

642
01:05:32,858 --> 01:05:34,154
Hello?

643
01:06:26,317 --> 01:06:27,920
What's going on?
Where are the Feds at?

644
01:06:27,945 --> 01:06:32,475
- There's no time, Vincent's alive.
- What? What are you talking about?

645
01:06:32,564 --> 01:06:36,061
He wants 10 million dollars, he wants it
in 3 hours and he has Alison.

646
01:06:36,895 --> 01:06:38,331
Oh, my God!

647
01:06:39,568 --> 01:06:42,594
The bank we robbed that night,
there was something else in that vault,

648
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:46,022
a gold reserve, it must've been 100 million, easy.

649
01:06:46,065 --> 01:06:48,104
There's no way you can walk in there

650
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:52,056
and steal 10 million dollars worth of
gold bricks in the middle of the business day.

651
01:06:52,148 --> 01:06:54,475
That's why I need your help.

652
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:58,285
- I already told you, this isn't my life anymore.
- I know, I know.

653
01:06:58,357 --> 01:07:01,650
- And it's not yours either.
- He's going to kill her.

654
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:08,685
I can... I can hear it in his voice,
He's not the same person.

655
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:13,480
He's gonna kill my little girl.

656
01:07:40,402 --> 01:07:44,271
- Are you LeFleur?
- Yes, Sir, I am. LeFleur, yes, Sir.

657
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:47,195
A guy jacked your cab a little while ago,
he was looking for someone.

658
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,485
Well, he was looking fo dat Mog...
Jimmy Morgan, Sir.

659
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:52,984
Be a peach and show me his hack license, will ya.

660
01:07:53,072 --> 01:07:56,703
Yes, officer, Sir.
I'll look it up for you, Inspector.

661
01:07:56,797 --> 01:08:00,818
He been with us two years, never any problem.

662
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,399
Although...

663
01:08:02,524 --> 01:08:07,349
He do scare my kids when they come
to visit their daddy at work.

664
01:08:07,652 --> 01:08:10,023
More kids are in their twenties.

665
01:08:13,866 --> 01:08:15,486
That's him, Kinsey.

666
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:21,528
Much obliged. Let's go!

667
01:08:35,363 --> 01:08:38,192
Fat Tuesday, everybody go crazy.

668
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:19,103
We're 6 blocks away from the bank,
do you realize that?

669
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,687
Have a little faith.

670
01:09:24,258 --> 01:09:27,478
I considered doing this for the last eight years.

671
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:08,021
30 meters, then we go left.

672
01:11:17,618 --> 01:11:21,481
Montgomery doesn't have the money,
but he NEEDS the money.

673
01:11:21,574 --> 01:11:23,733
Which means he's got only one play to make.

674
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:27,737
Give me a list of every bank that he stepped
into in the City of New Orleans.

675
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:31,404
My guess is one of them is
going to step into the game.

676
01:11:43,118 --> 01:11:44,529
We're through.

677
01:11:46,284 --> 01:11:49,071
- 5 minutes 'til the alarm.
- Is that going to be enough?

678
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:59,451
Here it comes.

679
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:48,455
Fire alarm just went off
at Parrish Community Bank.

680
01:12:48,538 --> 01:12:50,407
That's him! Get up there now!

681
01:12:56,828 --> 01:12:58,620
Hurry up, boys!

682
01:13:17,536 --> 01:13:19,581
The alarm will have
triggered by now, we gotta go.

683
01:13:19,665 --> 01:13:22,203
Just wanna see if I can get
a little more gold out of it.

684
01:13:57,582 --> 01:13:59,452
Would you hurry up, Sir?

685
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:03,577
Come on, Will, we gotta go.

686
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:08,219
Come on!

687
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:25,008
What do you know.

688
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:08,935
So you worked all this out in the prison?

689
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:11,230
I was bored.

690
01:15:14,772 --> 01:15:16,243
Boss! Hey! Listen to this.

691
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:16,893
Say again.

692
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,339
<i>We have the key suspects.</i>

693
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:20,886
<i>They're in Riley's truck on North Peters
heading towards the ferry.</i>

694
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:23,052
Do not take them until
they're off the ferry,

695
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:25,977
<i>I repeat, do not take them
until they're off the ferry.</i>

696
01:15:26,141 --> 01:15:28,176
We take 'em now, we got 'em boxed in.

697
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:29,997
If you want to corner a weasel,
this is the one that got bit.

698
01:15:29,998 --> 01:15:31,710
Boss, I hope you
know what you're doing.

699
01:15:31,746 --> 01:15:33,618
Takes only eight minutes to get
across the river in that ferry.

700
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:35,732
Wait for "strength in numbers".

701
01:15:35,805 --> 01:15:39,316
And when we get Montgomery, he'll
be as red-handed as the boy who put

702
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:42,944
his palm on the gas stove to
see how hot it really was.

703
01:15:43,257 --> 01:15:44,240
Okay.

704
01:15:51,521 --> 01:15:55,346
Don't make a move until all 4 wheels
touch Louisiana soil.

705
01:15:55,429 --> 01:15:56,975
<i>Copy that.</i>

706
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:28,107
Hands in the air. In the air, now!

707
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:33,430
Happy Fat Tuesday, officer.

708
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:34,501
Come on, come on, come on, get up! Get out!

709
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,105
<i>Time's is up, good buddy.</i>

710
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,804
I've got it.

711
01:17:42,306 --> 01:17:43,845
I am impressed.

712
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:45,963
Do you listen to a little
Creedence before you went in?

713
01:17:46,317 --> 01:17:50,181
No, I didn't listen to CCR, that didn't
work out so well the last time, did it?

714
01:17:52,484 --> 01:17:55,682
- I missed you, old buddy.
- I want to talk to her.

715
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:57,827
No, you'll talk to her when I get me the money.

716
01:17:58,067 --> 01:18:00,125
I want to talk to my daughter NOW!

717
01:18:00,126 --> 01:18:02,184
<i>I want to hear her voice NOW!</i>

718
01:18:02,408 --> 01:18:04,745
- It's your father.
- Hello.

719
01:18:04,855 --> 01:18:08,528
- Allison, Alison, did he hurt you?
- No.

720
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:10,682
<i>But he scares me.</i>

721
01:18:11,068 --> 01:18:13,063
I gonna be there soon, honey,
I'm gonna get you out of this.

722
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,025
<i>This is my fault.</i>

723
01:18:16,106 --> 01:18:19,837
Get my money to the fairgrounds NOW!

724
01:18:34,907 --> 01:18:35,845
Sorry, boss.

725
01:18:35,942 --> 01:18:39,963
Finally thought I recognized the
skills of Will Montgomery, huh?

726
01:18:40,056 --> 01:18:42,153
Do you have those listings
from the cab's dispatcher.

727
01:18:42,346 --> 01:18:44,257
GPS breakdowns, why?

728
01:18:45,244 --> 01:18:48,553
I told you Kinsey ditched his GPS in the
back of the cab in the French Quarter.

729
01:18:48,734 --> 01:18:51,734
I'm not interested in today’s,
I want to see the last few weeks.

730
01:18:51,777 --> 01:18:53,270
Kinsey gonna get the money from Montgomery

731
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:57,478
then he's gonna have some kind of
neutral rendezvous, and if that's the case

732
01:18:57,569 --> 01:18:58,940
he's been casing it for weeks.

733
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:01,777
Uptown, Lakefront, Beauvoir, Broadmoor, West Bank.

734
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:04,858
Beauvoir? Isn't that the fairground?

735
01:19:04,943 --> 01:19:07,495
Yeah, I think so.
20 minutes from out of town.

736
01:19:08,488 --> 01:19:09,612
Doesn't sound like a cab ride to me.

737
01:19:09,631 --> 01:19:12,231
It's the dough, Boss,
we'll actually catch this prick.

738
01:19:50,154 --> 01:19:53,170
Where's Allison?

739
01:19:56,446 --> 01:19:59,135
In the trunk?

740
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:06,111
- You look good, Will. Same.
- Where is she?

741
01:20:06,809 --> 01:20:09,926
She's safe.

742
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:32,856
The money. Hand her over.

743
01:20:34,932 --> 01:20:38,080
I said hand her over!

744
01:20:38,689 --> 01:20:42,107
You got the money, you win!
Vincent!

745
01:20:42,143 --> 01:20:44,716
Over a janitor.

746
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:50,794
You piss away 14 years of friendship
over an old man janitor?

747
01:20:51,032 --> 01:20:53,838
We're not killers.

748
01:20:53,874 --> 01:20:58,442
- Well, maybe not then.
- None of this has anything to do with my daughter.

749
01:21:00,467 --> 01:21:04,873
But it does, Will, because you TRULY love Alison.

750
01:21:04,966 --> 01:21:09,505
And in that single act of
betrayal 8 years ago, YOU

751
01:21:09,594 --> 01:21:15,211
destroy the only thing I ever truly loved.

752
01:21:16,929 --> 01:21:18,799
Me.

753
01:21:24,926 --> 01:21:27,299
No! No!

754
01:21:29,803 --> 01:21:34,026
Daddy! Daddy, please!

755
01:21:40,012 --> 01:21:43,282
Get me out of here.

756
01:21:47,553 --> 01:21:50,420
Help.

757
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,432
Daddy, hurry, it's hot in here.

758
01:22:02,303 --> 01:22:04,684
Help.

759
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:15,641
No.

760
01:23:05,054 --> 01:23:07,824
Help.

761
01:24:15,015 --> 01:24:17,751
I got you, I got you.

762
01:24:57,057 --> 01:24:59,617
Forehead. You're bleeding.

763
01:25:03,642 --> 01:25:07,091
I don't know what to do.
What do I do?

764
01:25:10,226 --> 01:25:15,246
I don't want to be alone, so don't die.
Don't die, please.

765
01:25:18,894 --> 01:25:20,968
Somebody help us.

766
01:25:22,224 --> 01:25:24,716
No, you can't die.

767
01:25:25,727 --> 01:25:27,964
Just stay with me.

768
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:39,287
They're coming, they're coming, hang in there.
Over here! Over here!

769
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:42,091
There.

770
01:25:44,185 --> 01:25:46,916
It's gonna be okay.

771
01:26:05,478 --> 01:26:08,062
No, no, no, he can't die.
You gotta save him.

772
01:26:08,186 --> 01:26:10,556
Come on, let's get him out of here.

773
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:29,428
You gonna send him back to jail?

774
01:26:29,521 --> 01:26:34,687
Now, why would I do that? I'm sure that
Vincent Kinsey stole that gold. Take her up!

775
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:41,350
- Alison.
- I'm here, Dad.

776
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,016
Hi, Dad.

777
01:27:42,104 --> 01:27:43,563
I'll call a HAZMAT team.

778
01:27:43,605 --> 01:27:45,765
- Why?
- You're cooking again.

779
01:27:47,773 --> 01:27:49,977
Wake me up if something happens.

780
01:28:08,732 --> 01:28:10,767
You ever clean your truck?

781
01:28:15,105 --> 01:28:18,238
Honey, can you flip the shrimp in 3 minutes?

782
01:28:18,312 --> 01:28:22,269
- Let go of control, Dad, I got it.
- I'm letting go.

783
01:28:27,922 --> 01:28:30,873
Definitely north of 3 hundred thousand dollars.

784
01:28:31,397 --> 01:28:33,638
The house could use a new roof and kitchen...

785
01:28:33,983 --> 01:28:38,059
He's got it! He's got that missing 10 pounds of gold.
That's what they're talking about.

786
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:41,024
- That something enough for you?
- Yeah, that is something.

787
01:28:41,831 --> 01:28:45,357
<i>- Well, if you take that gold...
- I know, I know, they'll nail me.</i>

788
01:28:46,148 --> 01:28:47,019
I can't see his lips.

789
01:28:47,172 --> 01:28:50,279
<i>I'm gonna disappear it in... in the mud.</i>

790
01:28:53,003 --> 01:28:55,741
<i>There.</i>

791
01:28:56,899 --> 01:28:59,620
He's not going to throw it.

792
01:28:59,656 --> 01:29:02,014
He just might and if he does wink I'll jack 'im.

793
01:29:02,108 --> 01:29:03,931
- Don't throw it.
- Look.

794
01:29:04,412 --> 01:29:09,979
- Don't do it!
- Do it!

795
01:29:10,015 --> 01:29:13,318
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Do it!

796
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,558
Yeah, sure! Keep it!

797
01:29:20,661 --> 01:29:25,698
Sell it, get rich.
And then go back to jail.

798
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:32,178
No. All right.
Goin' in.

799
01:29:43,734 --> 01:29:50,061
Oh, thank you, Will.
I'll return to my life now.

800
01:29:51,305 --> 01:30:51,381
