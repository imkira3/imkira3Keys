1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,691
Game
three of the 1985 Series

3
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,942
is just underway.

4
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,820
Kansas City trailing by one.

5
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,239
First pitch by Rosenthal is hit

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,866
on the ground towards second base.

7
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,202
Wexler's got it!
Fires to first...

8
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:20,787
and we've quickly got one out.

9
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:24,333
In 1985 his average was
.250 for the season.

10
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,105
Mom?

11
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,066
- Hmm, hi, darling.

12
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:51,067
Hi.

13
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,239
This is for your tea party.

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
- Thank you.

15
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,497
- Go out and play now girls.

16
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,540
Mama's got work to do.

17
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,379
Ivy, go take your sister upstairs.

18
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,214
- Come on, Violet.

19
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,215
Okay.

20
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,425
Let's go get Joy.

21
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,729
- Would you like any tea Madelyn?

22
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,730
Okay.

23
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,817
Careful, it's hot.

24
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,818
Very hot.

25
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,989
There you go.

26
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,033
And a cookie.

27
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,203
- Can you play Joy?
- Mm-hmm, c'mon.

28
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,497
Okay.

29
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,417
- Oh, goodie, tea.

30
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,293
- You pour some more tea Violet.

31
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,798
Some milk.

32
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,516
- Your daddy's home, Joy.

33
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,727
There's gonna be fireworks.

34
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,486
- Catherine?

35
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,669
Honey?

36
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:17,959
Who the fuck are you?

37
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,128
Don't.

38
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,883
Look, man, I don't
wanna fight you, alright?

39
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,176
- Just get the hell out!

40
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:29,012
- Becca?

41
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,013
Go.

42
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:37,770
- Baby let me get you some ice for that.

43
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:42,358
Ivan, wait.

44
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,196
You don't understand.

45
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:48,948
Ivan, please, would you listen to me?

46
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,200
- How many others,
Rebecca, how many others?

47
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:54,495
Grocery boy, mailman, how many?

48
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:56,081
And at my house?

49
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,375
- You think that this is easy,

50
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:00,294
sneaking around your wife

51
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,588
and pretending that
there's nothing between us?

52
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,719
- Catherine.

53
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,014
You're home.

54
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:16,225
- How long

55
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,648
you've been sleeping with
my husband right here

56
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,776
in my own house?

57
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,071
Ivan, tell her to get out.

58
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,573
Ivan, tell her.

59
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:31,574
Ivan?

60
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,409
Ivan?

61
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,870
Where are you going?

62
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,246
Shh.

63
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,247
- Whore.

64
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,875
- I am not a whore.

65
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:42,752
- Then what are you?

66
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,379
- He told me what you
like between the sheets.

67
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,631
Is it any wonder he needs a woman?

68
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,008
- It's happening again.

69
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,803
- Oh, no.

70
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,431
- I will give you 20 minutes
to get out of this house

71
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,517
and if you're not gone,

72
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,186
I will call the police
and have you removed.

73
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,905
Violet, take Madelyn.

74
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,573
- Bye.

75
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,492
Bye.

76
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,537
I'll try to write to you.

77
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,043
Thanks.

78
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,057
May I help you?

79
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,270
- Ah, yes, um, is this
still the Greer's residence?

80
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,189
- Yes, it is.

81
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,940
- I'm here to see Joy.

82
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:31,153
- Mm-hmm, may I tell her who's calling?

83
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,045
- Violet?

84
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,631
Violet.

85
00:09:55,302 --> 00:10:00,348
I can't believe it's you.

86
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:04,268
I can't believe it's you.

87
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,230
- Oh, thank you, Mrs. B.

88
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,112
It's hard to believe
that it's been 11 years.

89
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,697
- Daddy refuses to believe

90
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,616
I'm not 10 years old anymore.

91
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:19,617
- Hmm.

92
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,377
Um, I just moved back here from Arizona.

93
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:32,630
Um, I thought maybe I'd get
a waitressing job part time,

94
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,799
and maybe start some summer school classes

95
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,884
at the junior college.

96
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,719
- That's wonderful.

97
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,139
Makes me long to be 20 again.

98
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,558
- Being 20 is hard.

99
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,769
Not as hard as being eight,

100
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:51,566
<i>but then life wasn't
meant to be easy, was it?</i>

101
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,695
- Have you found an apartment?

102
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,446
- Not yet, but, um,

103
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,532
I put my name up on the board at school.

104
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,200
- Why not stay here?

105
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,328
- I, I couldn't.

106
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,746
But we have so much room.

107
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:06,999
It's really not a problem.

108
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,419
- Joy, can I have a word with
you in the kitchen, please?

109
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:20,595
Come here, ya crap.

110
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:25,349
- Joy, having Violet stay
here is out of the question.

111
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,561
- Why?
- Well, for many reasons.

112
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,479
It's been a long time.

113
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,647
Things have changed.

114
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:34,358
- Dad, Violet was my best friend.

115
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,444
When she and Ivy were here,
it was like having sisters,

116
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,239
and seeing her today it was
like nothing had changed.

117
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,868
- I know that sweetheart,
but where is she gonna sleep?

118
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,078
- We have an extra bedroom.

119
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,044
- That was your mother's room, Joy.

120
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:57,798
- I know that Dad.

121
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,009
What do you think Mrs. B?

122
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,388
- Oh, maybe the girl
could use a helping hand.

123
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,308
If you know what I mean?

124
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,775
- I promised you would be home again.

125
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:01,612
Welcome home, Madelyn.

126

- Michael.

143
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,113
We're going to get married.

144
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,241
- Married?
- In the fall.

145
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:11,617
Daddy wants us to wait,

146
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,702
but Michael wants me to
apply for transfer to Yale

147
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,580
so we can be together next year.

148
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,915
- Yale?

149
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,875
Is that far away?

150
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,502
- Connecticut, silly.

151
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:24,004
Michael will be home
from school next week.

152
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,590
I can't wait for you to meet him.

153
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,760
- He's very good looking.

154
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,555
- Remember when we were little

155
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,724
and we used to dress
up like we were brides?

156
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:39,228
- You made a veil out of a petticoat.

157
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,982
- And you made one out of a
whole roll of toilet paper.

158
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,119
- What about your dad?

159
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,747
I mean, what's he gonna
do when you get married?

160
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,416
- I don't know.

161
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:04,587
Sometimes I'm afraid he'll end up alone.

162
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,297
- He doesn't date?

163
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,884
- There was a woman named
Gwen he talks about.

164
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,635
Mrs. B. And I keep hoping
he'll find the time

165
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,179
to ask her out.

166
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,391
- It wouldn't bother you if
he got serious or anything?

167
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,350
- Why should it?

168
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,352
He's been alone a long time.

169
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,147
He deserves to be with someone nice.

170
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,651
But I don't think he'll
ever get over my mother.

171
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,112
I mean, you've probably noticed

172
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:31,656
how her room is still the same.

173
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,326
After all of these years,

174
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,369
Dad still can't bring
himself to change it.

175
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,872
- You must really miss her too?

176
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,873
- I do.

177
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,795
A lot, I really need her sometimes.

178
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:23,582
Violet?

179
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,919
Hello?

180
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,173
Violet?

181
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,164
Connecticut?

182
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,298
- No, thank you, Mrs. B.

183
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:21,051
So, how's Yale this year Michael?

184
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,262
- Um, good sir.

185
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,973
I'm developing some
important relationships.

186
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,182
Good.

187
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:29,351
- Michael's fourth in his class this year.

188
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:31,353
That's very impressive for freshman year.

189
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:32,980
- That's very impressive for any year.

190
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,148
So Michael we're looking forward

191
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,233
to having you at the bank this summer.

192
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,359
Will we see you on Monday?

193
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,236
- Absolutely, I'm looking forward to it.

194
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,988
- Good, and you'll be pleased to know

195
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,656
that you've got the house
to yourselves tonight

196
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:44,324
because I...
- Got a meeting.

197
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,160
- Got a meeting, that's right.

198
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,578
- Goodnight, Dad.
- Goodnight.

199
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,539
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight, Michael.

200
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,751
- It's party time.

201
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:56,504
Michael, you should've been

202
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,088
at the club for drinks.

203
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,256
There's some new blood.

204
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,133
More of these hotties you can get to know.

205
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,217
Have a good time, my brother.

206
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:03,385
Yeah, I'll have a good time.

207
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:04,971
Scott, what's up?

208
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:07,222
How's Princeton?

209
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:08,850
A bitch.

210
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,768
The classes or the girls?

211
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,520
- To uncompromising women.

212
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:14,813
Here here.

213
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:16,774
So, I hear you're
tearing up the courts?

214
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,026
- Got my last Division
one tournament on Friday.

215
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,694
- Then it's hello Ivy League.

216
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,446
- If I win.

217
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,531
- No, ifs, you're in your prime.

218
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:26,158
Jaimie, am I right?

219
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,620
- We have lived on that court
for the past two months.

220
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,413
If she could eat and sleep out there,

221
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:32,957
that's where we'd be right now.

222
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,877
- You're Violet, right?

223
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,921
What are you doing this summer?

224
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,465
- She's taking classes
at the junior college.

225
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,550
- Ooh, the junior college.

226
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:45,803
My maid took English classes there.

227
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,889
- Is it a tough school to get into?

228
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,392
- Oh, no, they'll accept
just about anybody.

229
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:54,686
As long as your welfare
check doesn't bounce.

230
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:55,522

- Violet?

234
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,703
- No, I have to go to work.

235
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:12,704
- Right now?

236
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:16,750
- Yeah, I drew the late shift tonight.

237
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:18,753
You know, new kid on the block and all.

238

- You guys leave her alone.

242
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,727
She's had it pretty tough.

243
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:38,230
- What was she doing
here in the first place?

244
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,149
- Her mother was their maid.

245
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,735

Michael, stop it.

252
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:49,069
Dammit, Joy,
what's the matter now?

253
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,488
- I told you, I have a lot on my mind.

254
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,781
I have an early practice tomorrow.

255
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,075
I'm just not in the mood.

256
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,372
- Well if your mother was this uptight,

257
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,082
no wonder your dad fooled around.

258
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,419
- How dare you say that to me?

259
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:07,671
I confided in you about that.

260
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,799
I can't believe you
would throw in my face.

261
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,677
- Look, I'm sorry.

262
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,144
How about I come by after
your practice tomorrow, okay?

263
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:54,844
- Oh, my God.

264
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,722
- You think it was Daddy?

265
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,307
- You scared me half to death.

266
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,308
- Hmm.

267
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,208
- That's some, that's some outfit there.

268
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,752
Where did you say you worked again?

269
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:29,628
- Denny's.

270
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,588
In Hollywood.

271
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,300
It's, um, under new management.

272
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,721
- I, um, I guess I've
never eaten there before.

273
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,477
- Would you like to?

274
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:49,357
You should see the look on your face.

275
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,819
- Look, um, it's kinda late.

276
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,737
I gotta go.

277
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,407
- Mm, c'mon, it's a joke.

278
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:05,706
Look, I, um, I think we
got off to a bad start.

279
00:27:29,772 --> 00:27:33,651
Mm, I see we have a little
unfinished business.

280
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,372
Stock market's up.

281
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,378
Mm, and I see we're a major stockholder.

282
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,750
Just a minute.

283
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,217
Come in.

284
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,679
Oh, hi.

285
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Hi.

286
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:49,476
I wanted to apologize
for my friends tonight.

287
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,770
They can be pretty annoying sometimes.

288
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,812
- Don't worry about it.

289
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:54,397
It didn't bother me.

290
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,859
- Well, it bothered me, I'm sorry.

291
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,613
Can I talk to you about something?

292
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,948
- Sure.

293
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,620
- You never get urges or anything?

294
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,456
- I do, a lot,

295
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,918
but when it comes down to it,

296
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,756
I just get tense.

297
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,093
I don't even want him inside me.

298
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,721
I've never had an orgasm with him.

299
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,810
I've never even had an orgasm.

300
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,145
I think my mother was the same way.

301
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:36,774
I mean, she did sleep in
this room most of the time.

302
00:29:38,484 --> 00:29:39,735
What if I'm just like her?

303
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:47,201
- The first time I was
with a guy I was 13.

304
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:53,165
I was known as the school
slut by the time I was 14.

305
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,166
Then I got smart.

306
00:29:57,878 --> 00:29:59,130
I stopped going to school.

307
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,016
- Excuse me?

308
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,684
Where did you get that?

309
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,852
- This?

310
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,936
Why?

311
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:16,856
Well, that
doesn't belong to you.

312
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:19,399
- Now how would you know that?

313
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,485
- Because it belonged to Mrs. Greer.

314
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:23,821
- Well she's not using it.

315
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:26,197
Is she?

316
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:44,632
- Mm-hmm.

317
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,150
More coffee Mr. Greer?

318
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:45,735
- Ah, no, no.

319
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:48,321
Thank you, Mrs. B, thank you.
- Okay, then.

320
00:31:57,164 --> 00:31:59,249
- "Dearest Joy,

321
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,377
"I've kicked, I'm clean.

322
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:05,338
"I might even make amends for
all the hurt I've laid on you.

323
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:06,339
"Love, Michael.”

324
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:12,721
So, ole Micheal had a
little drug problem, did he?

325
00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:28,779

326
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:32,073
Is that honking for you?

327
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:33,283
- Yeah, it's Jaimie.

328
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,118
We've got a practice

329
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,201
doubles match.

330
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:36,536
- When will you be back?

331
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,288
- Probably late.

332
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,165
- I was kinda hoping we
could spend the day together.

333
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,624
- Oh, I've gotta practice.

334
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,210
The last division one tournament
is the day after tomorrow.

335
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,336
I gotta win.

336
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:47,338
- You don't gotta win Joy.

337
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,674
- Oh, yes I do.

338
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:52,844
- You know, you're
really hard on yourself.

339
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,346
You don't have to be perfect all the time.

340
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:56,639
- If I were perfect I wouldn't have

341
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,893
to work twice as hard as
everyone else, would I?

342
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:05,023
Hey, Jaimie and I will be
practicing here this afternoon.

343
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,066
You should come watch.

344
00:33:10,362 --> 00:33:11,405
- Oh, goodie.

345
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,041
What are you doing?

346
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:28,880
- Well, in case you hadn't noticed,

347
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:29,964
I am the housekeeper here.

348
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:31,132
This is what I do.

349
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:33,510
- Well, I would appreciate
it if from now on

350
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,888
you'd let me know when
you're gonna come in my room.

351
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:47,774
Hmm.

352
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,117
- Larry's been a naughty boy.

353
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,544
Hi, my time is your time.

354
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,004
Where do you wanna meet?

355
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:12,049
What are you in the mood for?

356
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,552
That'll cost extra you know?

357
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:17,595
Okay.

358
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:55,717
- Really?

359
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,468
They didn't tell me that.

360
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:59,387
I can't believe that happened.

361
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,722
That's crazy.
- You know, Jaimie,

362
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,348
I need play this set.
- Ah, hold on.

363
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:03,516
In a minute okay?

364
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:05,893
- Jaimie you're supposed
to be my training partner.

365
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:07,895
- Alright, alright, I'm coming.

366
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:09,147
I'm gonna go get a drink.

367
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,398
Do you want anything?

368
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,358
- Anything, just hurry up.

369
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:13,860
- Okay.

370
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,612
Listen, I have to go, okay?

371
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,363
No, really I have to go.

372
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:44,641
Hey.

373
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,642
- You guys look like you could use

374
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,018
something cold to drink.

375
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,019
- Excellent.

376
00:35:48,854 --> 00:35:51,189
Throw it in a
blender, add a little ice,

377
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,108
and you got yourself something tropical.

378
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,905
- A little extra kick never hurt.

379
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,906
- I suppose not.

380
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,015
Oops.

381
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:37,443
Oops.

382
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,667
- Jaimie, what did you put in those

383
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,751
drinks?

384
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:58,716
The tiniest
shot of rum.

385
00:37:00,342 --> 00:37:03,052
I swear, the tiniest.

386
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:04,596
- Play to win ladies.

387
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:34,083
- Joy, I don't believe it.

388
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:35,168
Come on Joy.

389
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,169
Joy sit up.

390
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,254
Joy?

391
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,300
- Hey there.

392
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,595
What's going on?

393
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,057
They're, they're both drunk.

394
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,476
- That's weird.

395
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,520
- When's Mr. Greer get home?

396
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:56,147
- Probably any minute, why?

397
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,774
- Are you kidding?

398
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,983
He's a total fascist.

399
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,027
If he sees Joy like this he'll freak.

400
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,613
C'mon, help me get her upstairs.

401
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,032
- I'll just tell him that
she's got a headache.

402
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,950
- Yeah, that won't be a lie.

403
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:08,993
We'll have to come back for here.

404
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,498
Michael I'm gonna be sick.

405
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,375
- Oh god, just hang on, okay?

406
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:23,175
- Wait, hold on a second.

407
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,302
- Are you crazy?

408
00:38:32,392 --> 00:38:33,392
Oh man.

409
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,232
Mr. Greer, how goes it?

410
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,817
- Where's Joy?

411
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,486
- Um, she went upstairs with a headache.

412
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,446
She was on the court all day

413
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,863
and I guess she overdid it.

414
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:46,740
- Well I better look in on her.

415
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,325
- No, I'll do it.

416
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:51,495
- Alright, Michael, thank you.

417
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:59,627
Man.

418
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,878
More record highs today

419
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:02,965
as the Moody Industrial gained 21 points.

420
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,717
Okay, get the lights.

421
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,053
Okay.

422
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,061
- That's fine, alright?
- Okay.

423
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:18,938
- Up you go.

424
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,949
I just don't understand
what Joy was thinking.

425
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,910
She knows she needs every
second of practice she can get.

426
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:34,412
This could screw up everything.

427
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,038
- Maybe that's what she wants?

428
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,039
- What?

429
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,292
- Never mind.

430
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,585
It's not my place.

431
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,087
- Did she say something to you?

432
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:45,339
- Well, the way she talks,

433
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,757
it sounds to me like she thinks things

434
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:48,217
are moving a little too fast.

435
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:50,386
I mean, getting married,
moving to Connecticut.

436
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:52,263
- But we already decided.

437
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,561
- She thinks maybe you're
pushing a little too hard.

438
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:02,189
She thinks maybe you guys
should try dating other people.

439
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,567
- What are you talking about?

440
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:06,485
Are you saying she's like
been seeing other people?

441
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:08,405
Like while I've been away or something?

442
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,948
Shit.

443
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:11,949
Who is it?

444
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:14,535
I can't believe it.

445
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:15,912
I can't believe she's cheated on me

446
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,122
after I've been faithful this whole time.

447
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:20,041
- Except for last night.

448
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,007
- Listen, you just stay
away from me, alright?

449
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,197
Hi.

450
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,283
You didn't have any dinner.

451
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:55,284
- Thank you so much, Violet.

452
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:56,411
That's so sweet.

453
00:40:57,996 --> 00:41:00,122
- What is this stuff?

454
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:01,750
- Oh, it's nothing, spreadsheets.

455
00:41:04,002 --> 00:41:05,379
- No wonder your eyes hurt.

456
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:08,297
Is all this stuff really part of your job?

457
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:09,216
- I'm afraid so Violet.

458
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,842
It keeps me out of trouble though.

459
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,095
- Maybe a little trouble
isn't such a bad thing.

460
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:14,930
- Excuse me?

461
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:18,892
- Well, it just seems to me
like you're avoiding something.

462
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,313
Joy told me that you've never really

463
00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:25,774
gotten over Catherine's death.

464
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,945
You know, there's nothing wrong

465
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,863
with having feelings Ivan.

466
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:34,408
I can call you Ivan?

467
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:41,123
If you feel something, go with it.

468
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:42,498
You know?

469
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:48,046
I mean, don't be afraid
to follow where it leads.

470
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:54,010
Otherwise, what would
be the point of living?

471
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,305
Spreadsheets.

472
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,517
Well, don't work too hard.

473
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,564
- Goodnight.

474
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,163
- Oh, my god.

475
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,206
Oh, my god.

476
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,757
- Where are you going?

477
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,885
Wait, wait don't leave yet.

478
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,303
Joy will be right back.

479
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:22,139
- Oh, my god.

480
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,140
Oh, my god.

481
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,278
- Do you always swim in the nude?

482
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,280
- Did you enjoy that?

483
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:21,366
- Not as much as you did, I bet.

484
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:27,414
- Actually, I didn't even
know you were still here.

485
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,919
- I'm not leaving till I
straighten things out with Joy.

486
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,922
- Have you decided what
you're gonna say to her?

487
00:44:36,923 --> 00:44:37,923
- Not exactly.

488
00:44:40,635 --> 00:44:41,927
- Maybe this will help.

489
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,392
- I don't do that anymore.

490
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,727
I've made a promise to Joy.

491
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,021
- Aren't you a good boy.

492
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,404
I just thought it might help.

493
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,522
I bet you've promised
yourself all sorts of things

494
00:45:35,523 --> 00:45:37,441
where Joy is concerned,

495
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:39,819
but promises were meant
to be broken Michael.

496
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,289
♪ I want you to stay ♪

497
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:56,210

- Look, this did not happen.

534
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:45,547
- Play to win Michael.

535
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:08,652
- You know, my old mother used to say,

536
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:12,448
that house guests and fish

537
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,410
start to smell after about three days.

538
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,412
- And what is that supposed to mean?

539
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,080
- Oh, nothing.

540
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:21,999
- You know, I was wondering,

541
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,211
the B, short for bitch?

542
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,263
- I feel like I've hit by a truck.

543
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,264
Drink this.

544
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,189
- Does my dad know?

545
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,565
- Actually, he thinks you went

546
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,109
to bed early with a headache.

547
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,487
- I can't believe Jaimie.

548
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,071
Getting drunk and then
splitting like that.

549
00:49:53,072 --> 00:49:55,157
I'm so angry at her.

550
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,909
- She seemed a little upset herself.

551
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,994
- I know, I'd like to strangle her.

552
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,747
I have exactly 21 hours
until the tournament.

553
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,457
I can't even see straight.

554
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,001
- Well, I'll keep the coffee coming.

555
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,002
- Joy?

556
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,089
Michael left his jacket in my den

557
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,758
and this fell out of it.

558
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,259
Now I can't allow this in my business

559
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,053
and I will not allow it in my family,

560
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,263
do you understand me Joy?

561
00:50:19,724 --> 00:50:21,850
- It's gotta be a mistake.

562
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:23,560
- The only mistake was me allowing you

563
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:24,770
to date him in the first place.

564
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,896
- Shouldn't we at least give him

565
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,482
a chance to explain himself?

566
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,944
- Now I know you'll do the right thing.

567
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:43,747
- He promised me never again.

568
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:44,832
He lied to me.

569
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,379
- Nothing's more important
than the truth Joy,

570
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,008
but I guess you can't
expect that from a druggie.

571
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:56,051
- He's not a druggie.

572
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:59,681
He's just, he's under a
lot of pressure, and...

573
00:51:04,185 --> 00:51:05,185
What am I gonna do?

574
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:12,443
- Listen, everything's gonna be okay.

575
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:16,531
Everything's gonna be just fine.

576
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:20,326
I promise.

577
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,665
- Jaimie doesn't wanna see me anymore,

578
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,709
and she said she doesn't
wanna be partners either.

579
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,420
- Hmm, I'm not surprised.

580
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,546
I knew from the minute I met her

581
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,757
she was only into you
for what she could get.

582
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,717
- You think so?

583
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,553
- She's nothing but a social climber.

584
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:46,143
It's Michael.

585
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,145
I'll go down and talk to him.

586
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,146
Thanks.

587
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:55,903
- I wanna talk to her Violet.

588
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,780
- You know, Michael,
you're really starting

589
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:00,574
to hurt my feelings.

590
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,409
- What are you talking about?

591
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,493
- You can't keep pretending

592
00:52:03,494 --> 00:52:06,413
like we're not sleeping together.

593
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,709
I mean, I thought we had
something special going.

594
00:52:12,378 --> 00:52:14,796
- You told her about
last night, didn't you?

595
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:16,089
You bitch.

596
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,967
- I didn't tell here anything Michael.

597
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,677
I didn't have to.

598
00:52:20,678 --> 00:52:22,722
You did this all by yourself.

599
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,241
His pupils were totally dilated.

600
00:52:43,242 --> 00:52:44,661
He wasn't making any sense.

601
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,788
He thinks the reason you won't talk to him

602
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,831
is because of me.

603
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,752
- It's just like him to
blame everyone but himself.

604
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,131
- Don't help him Joy.

605
00:52:58,299 --> 00:52:59,299
Fuck him.

606
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,469
- Right.

607
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,971
I have to stop making excuses for him.

608
00:53:04,972 --> 00:53:06,224
I have to be tough.

609
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,394
He has to take responsibility.

610
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:25,742
Michael just doesn't give up, doe he?

611
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:27,453
- They're not from Michael.

612
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:29,163
They're for Gwen,

613
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,664
your dad's date for tonight.

614
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,543
- He finally asked her out?
- Yes, he did.

615
00:53:43,928 --> 00:53:44,804
- How do I look Mrs. B?

616
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,056
- Oh, Mr. Greer, in my humble opinion

617
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:49,474
you are beyond handsome.

618
00:53:49,475 --> 00:53:51,977
Oh, thank you, Mrs. B.

619
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,229
Oh, could you get the flowers for me?

620
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,230
Thanks.

621
00:54:00,194 --> 00:54:01,319
Hi, honey.

622
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,320
- Hey Dad.

623
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,617
Well, very handsome.
- Thanks.

624
00:54:07,618 --> 00:54:08,869
Where are you off to?

625
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,454
- I'm meeting my coach to practice

626
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,039
one last time before the big tournament.

627
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,041
- Listen honey, with
everything happening around us,

628
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:16,960
I, I realize I haven't been
that supportive of you,

629
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:19,588
but I want you to know
there's no doubt in my mind

630
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,757
you're gonna win that tournament.

631
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:22,592
- Thanks, Dad.

632
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,217
I just hope I don't let you down.

633
00:54:24,218 --> 00:54:25,343
- You won't, you're a Greer.

634
00:54:25,344 --> 00:54:26,762
We deliver.

635
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,555
- Oh, here you go.
- Ah, Mrs. B.

636
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,307
Thank you so much.
- Oh, alright.

637
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,558
Oh, no, you got some lint there

638
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,559
right on your shoulder Mr. Greer.

639
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,643
Let me get my brush.

640
00:54:33,644 --> 00:54:35,395
- No, no, Mrs. B, that's
gonna have to stay.

641
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:36,605
I gotta pick up Gwen at 7:30.

642
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,647
I gotta get outta here.

643
00:54:37,648 --> 00:54:38,648
- Really?
- Yes.

644
00:54:38,649 --> 00:54:40,193
Come on Joy, let's go.
- Okay.

645
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,912
- Hello?
- Oh, hi, this is Gwen Randle.

646
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,246
Is this Ivan's daughter?

647
00:54:53,247 --> 00:54:54,165
- Yes it is.

648
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,374
Listen Joy,
has your dad left yet?

649
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:57,210
- Oh, yes.

650
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,544
Shoot, can you
get a message to him?

651
00:54:59,545 --> 00:55:00,712
- Oh, absolutely.

652
00:55:00,713 --> 00:55:01,547
Could you please tell him to

653
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,132
meet me outside the courthouse
and not at my office?

654
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:06,092
I'll be in front of kiosk.

655
00:55:06,093 --> 00:55:06,969
- You've got it.

656
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,970
Thanks Joy.

657
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:08,930
- No problem.
- Bye.

658
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,306
- Thanks, B-bye.

659
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,330
Hello, this
is the Greer residence.

660
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,667
Will you please leave a
message after the tone.

661
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,002
Ivan, what happened?

662
00:55:41,003 --> 00:55:43,630
I stood outside the
courthouse for nearly an hour.

663
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,466
To say I'm pissed off
would be an understatement.

664
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:49,970
In fact, do me a favor and lose my number.

665
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:13,244
- I love champagne.

666
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,338
- Darling you're not legal.

667
00:56:25,339 --> 00:56:27,550
- I won't tell if you won't.

668
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,177
Why are you so dressed up?

669
00:56:31,178 --> 00:56:32,178
- Party.

670
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,183
You're home early.

671
00:56:37,184 --> 00:56:38,184
Mm.

672
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,687
- She didn't like them?

673
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,064
- Actually, she stood me up.

674
00:56:43,065 --> 00:56:45,817
- I'm sorry.
- Mm, I'll live.

675
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:47,153
- You know, in all my life,

676
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:50,740
I don't think I've ever gotten flowers.

677
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:07,130
I just wanted to feel pretty tonight.

678
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:08,549
Maybe dance a little.

679
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:12,427
Laugh.

680
00:57:16,265 --> 00:57:17,265
Feel good.

681
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:23,939
I know that must seem silly.

682
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,940
I know.

683
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,660
Dance with me?

684
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:41,331
I'm not
much of a dancer Violet.

685
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,500

01:00:01,722 --> 01:00:03,348
- Don't do this to me.

710
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,114
I will win.

711
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,115
I will win.

Please let me win.

713
01:03:21,755 --> 01:03:22,715
Joy you're gonna have to speak

714
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:23,965
to me sooner or later.

715
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,884
- Michael will you leave me alone?

716
01:03:26,885 --> 01:03:28,261
That's not fair.

717
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:29,262
- Fair?

718
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,515
Michael, god, you're driving me crazy,

719
01:03:32,516 --> 01:03:33,725
and I've got the tournament this morning.

720
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,018
- I know.

721
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,103
I wanna be there for you.

722
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,147
I love you Joy.

723
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,274
- I don't know Michael.

724
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,275
- Joy?

725
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,161
- Alright, we'll talk.

726
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:55,204
After the tournament I'll meet you

727
01:03:55,205 --> 01:03:57,248
at the coffee house on campus.

728
01:03:57,249 --> 01:03:58,249
- Okay.

729
01:03:59,668 --> 01:04:00,710
- I gotta go.

730
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:01,711
- Hey?

731
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,422
Good luck.

732
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:05,882
- Thanks.

733
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,933
- Greer residence?

734
01:04:15,934 --> 01:04:17,935
Oh, hello Gwen.

735
01:04:17,936 --> 01:04:20,897
No, his daughter's at a tennis
tournament this morning,

736
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:23,232
but I'm sure he'll be
in his office later on.

737
01:04:23,233 --> 01:04:24,360
Can I take a message?

738
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,614
You did? How many messages did you leave?

739
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:31,866
I see.

740
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,495
Well, I can guarantee you

741
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,790
that he never received
any of your messages,

742
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:40,875
but I'm pretty sure who did.

743
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,840
- Going somewhere?

744
01:04:47,841 --> 01:04:49,050
- I don't know what you think

745
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,177
you're up to little girl or why,

746
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:53,554
but I'm gonna put a stop to it right now.

747
01:04:53,555 --> 01:04:55,014
- I don't think so.

748
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,278
You bitch.

749
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:10,530
I got a call from Greer's office

750
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,240
telling me not to report
to my job on Monday

751
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,409
because they found another intern.

752
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,745
You set me up, you got me
high, and you seduced me.

753
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:19,163
- If that's what you need to believe

754
01:05:19,164 --> 01:05:21,082
so you can live with yourself,

755
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,500
it's okay with me.

756
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,919
- You're setting them up
just like you set me up.

757
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,462
- They're my family.

758
01:05:26,463 --> 01:05:28,131
I would never do anything to harm them.

759
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:30,466
- They're not your family.

760
01:05:30,467 --> 01:05:31,467
Your family's dead.

761
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,470
Yeah, that's right.

762
01:05:34,471 --> 01:05:35,680
I did a little checking.

763
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,640
That junior college
never even heard of you.

764
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:39,058
Then I find out your sister Ivy

765
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:40,143
threw herself out of a window.

766
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:41,686
- Shut up.
- And let's not forget

767
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:42,687
about what happened to your mother.

768
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:43,814
- I said shut up.

769
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:48,110
- I bet you don't even
work at Denny's, do you?

770
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,156
- Now what?

771
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,616
- I'm gonna tell Joy what kind of a person

772
01:05:55,617 --> 01:05:56,826
she's really living with.

773
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,412
- So you're gonna tell
her you're fucking me?

774
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,330
- I'm gonna tell her truth.

775
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:03,791
Oh, that'll be an
interesting approach for you.

776
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:04,792
Think she'll buy it?

777
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,171
- I don't think it's gonna
be too hard to convince her.

778
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:10,923
Look, I'm gonna be meeting
her at two o'clock,

779
01:06:10,924 --> 01:06:13,468
so that'll still give you
enough time to get out.

780
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,428
- Well she won't be there.

781
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:17,597
She never planned to meet you.

782
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:19,056
- You're such a liar.

783
01:06:19,057 --> 01:06:22,518
- Really, then why did she
tell your good buddy Scott

784
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:24,438
to pick her up at the house at 1:30?

785
01:06:25,397 --> 01:06:26,397
Hmm?

786
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:32,737
Fuck you.

787
01:06:47,544 --> 01:06:49,296
- You're gonna be so sorry.

788
01:06:57,888 --> 01:06:58,888
- Joy?

789
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:11,151
Joy?

790
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,700
Joy?

791
01:07:22,746 --> 01:07:23,746
Mrs. B?

792
01:07:30,128 --> 01:07:31,128
Joy?

793
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:37,613
- Curiosity killed the cat.

794
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:41,074
Right now, Joy's sitting
somewhere waiting for you.

795
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,577
Guess you let her down again Michael.

796
01:08:53,086 --> 01:08:56,965
Hmm, do you know what
kind of people like pain?

797
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:04,222
Let's see, there's doctors and lawyers.

798
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:09,394
I even have a judge for
a client.

799
01:09:10,562 --> 01:09:13,690
But you know, it's not the
pain that gets them off,

800
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,028
it's the feeling of someone
else being in control.

801
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:24,409
I'm in control now Michael.

802
01:09:26,536 --> 01:09:28,205
You know this whole thing with Joy

803
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,999
is really just about Daddy's bank,

804
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:33,167
wasn't it?

805
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:40,217
I got a really good chuckle
out of your pathetic rambling.

806
01:09:44,429 --> 01:09:46,013
Kiss, Kiss.

807
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:54,355
You really should have
kept your promise to Joy.

808
01:09:56,858 --> 01:09:58,484
Stayed away from the drugs.

809
01:10:03,281 --> 01:10:06,535
This is the shit that
killed you.

810
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:15,836
I guarantee you've never felt
anything like this before.

811
01:10:29,766 --> 01:10:31,059
Bye-bye Michael.

812
01:10:51,496 --> 01:10:52,496
Joy?

813
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,504
You alright?

814
01:11:00,505 --> 01:11:03,758
- I played like I've never held
a racket before in my life.

815
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,344
I just, I couldn't concentrate, you know?

816
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:09,222
- It's Michael's fault.

817
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:12,683
He totally distracted you.

818
01:11:12,684 --> 01:11:13,894
- He didn't even show up.

819
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:16,896
He didn't call again, did he?

820
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:17,897
Come by?

821
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:19,732
- Been here all day.

822
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:24,570
- I wanted to teach Michael a lesson

823
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,114
and that would make him go away.

824
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,992
I made a mess of everything.

825
01:11:32,412 --> 01:11:33,996
- You don't see it.

826
01:11:33,997 --> 01:11:38,959
It's not you, it's them.

827
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,712
- But I want them to love me.

828
01:11:42,088 --> 01:11:43,464
- Do you think they care?

829
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,508
Well they never will.

830
01:11:47,135 --> 01:11:49,637
They'll just use you and throw you away.

831
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,264
It's the same for both of us Joy.

832
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:55,894
We're the same in so many ways.

833
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:01,982
Sometimes I just wish
the rest of the world

834
01:12:01,983 --> 01:12:02,983
would fade away.

835
01:12:06,112 --> 01:12:07,822
- Where did you get those?

836
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:08,948
Those are my mother's.

837
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:12,494
- I just came across them.

838
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,871
I didn't you'd mind if I borrowed them.

839
01:12:15,872 --> 01:12:17,456
- They were in her jewelry box

840
01:12:17,457 --> 01:12:18,834
in the back of her closet.

841
01:12:20,752 --> 01:12:22,628
Please put them back.

842
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:26,257
- Fine, it's not that big of a deal Joy.

843
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:28,300
- Yes it is Violet.

844
01:12:28,301 --> 01:12:29,301
I think maybe things are getting

845
01:12:29,302 --> 01:12:30,553
a little too intense around here.

846
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,430
- What are you trying to say?

847
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:37,434
- I think maybe it would be a good idea

848
01:12:37,435 --> 01:12:40,312
if you started thinking
about another place to live.

849
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,344
- It's alright baby.

850
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:15,389
I'll fix it.

851
01:13:18,476 --> 01:13:19,476
I promise.

852
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:46,838
- Oh, my god, he was here.

853
01:13:49,132 --> 01:13:50,424
She lied to me.

854
01:14:06,566 --> 01:14:07,566
Hi

855
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:11,904
- I, ah, I brought these for Joy.

856
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:13,364
I, I know she's feeling upset

857
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:16,033
about losing the tournament.

858
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,119
- Well, I'm sure she'll love them.

859
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:24,876
- I talked to Gwen today.

860
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,796
You pretended you were Joy, didn't you?

861
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,340
You didn't give me her messages.

862
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,529
- I didn't give you the messages

863
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,072
because I was jealous.

864
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,327
- Joy was wrong.

865
01:15:00,328 --> 01:15:01,328
- About what?

866
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:04,290
- It wasn't Catherine I couldn't get over.

867
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:06,834
It was your mother.

868
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,964
God, you look so much like her.

869
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:20,724
I told you, I just can't
do this with you Violet.

870
01:15:22,934 --> 01:15:24,811
- But you already have.

871
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,022
Only I'm not gonna let you turn away

872
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,565
from me like you did her.

873
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:45,415
- Hello?

874
01:16:05,393 --> 01:16:06,393
Dad?

875
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:18,865
Michael?

876
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:20,157
No, this is his father.

877
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:22,743
- Oh, Mr. Beckett, I was
just looking for Michael.

878
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,870
I'm afraid 1
have some bad news for you.

879
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:26,163
- What?

880
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:27,957
Michael's been found dead.

881
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:30,834
- What?

882
01:16:30,835 --> 01:16:31,795
Well,
they're not sure yet,

883
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:34,255
but it seems like he
might have been murdered.

884
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:37,592
- No.

885
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,720
Joy?

886
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:47,935
- Daddy?

887
01:16:55,026 --> 01:16:58,695
Oh, my god.

888
01:16:58,696 --> 01:16:59,531
Oh.

889
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:02,825
Untie me.

890
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:07,579
Joy?

891
01:17:09,332 --> 01:17:10,332
- Joy?
- Joy?

892
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,335
- Joy, please don't leave.

893
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,050
- Oh, god.

894
01:17:21,761 --> 01:17:25,222
Stop it, Violet.

895
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:28,601
- Ivan, everything's gonna be alright.

896
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,357
- I should have never taken
advantage of you Violet.

897
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,530
You've got to go and you've got to go now.

898
01:17:44,075 --> 01:17:45,075
- GO?

899
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,121
You fucked me,

900
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,917
and now you're throwing me out?

901
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,421
Just like my mother.

902
01:17:58,339 --> 01:17:59,924
You promised to take care of her

903
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:03,052
and that she would be provided for.

904
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:08,474
I told ya I wouldn't let
you turn away from me.

905
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:12,436
I meant it.

906
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:22,906
- Just get out.

907
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:08,408
If
you'd like to make a call,

908
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:09,993
please hangup and try again.

909
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:18,253
Violet, help me.

910
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:01,791
- Mrs. B?

911
01:22:10,341 --> 01:22:11,675
Mrs. B?

912
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:54,134
Mrs. B?

913
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,343
Mrs. B, I need to come in.

914
01:22:55,344 --> 01:22:57,012
The breaker box is in your closet.

915
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:27,936
Daddy?

916
01:24:27,937 --> 01:24:29,396
Daddy?

917
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,339
Violet?

918
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:52,270
Oh, my god.

919
01:26:04,283 --> 01:26:06,242
Where's my father?

920
01:26:06,243 --> 01:26:07,327
- He's gone.

921
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:08,788
- What have you done with him?

922
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:11,289
- He did it to himself.

923
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:13,124
- What are you talking about?

924
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:15,169
- Here, put this on.

925
01:26:17,296 --> 01:26:18,421
- I don't think I want to.

926
01:26:18,422 --> 01:26:19,507
- I want you to.

927
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:24,344
Besides, you can't go like that.

928
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,596
- Go, go where?

929
01:26:26,597 --> 01:26:27,682
- We're going together,

930
01:26:28,849 --> 01:26:30,393
but we have to be dressed up.

931
01:26:31,727 --> 01:26:34,647
So here, put it on.

932
01:26:36,899 --> 01:26:37,899
- Alright.

933
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:41,403
Okay.

934
01:26:48,035 --> 01:26:49,870
You're really freaking me out Violet.

935
01:26:50,871 --> 01:26:53,748
- Now sit and I'll pour tea.

936
01:26:53,749 --> 01:26:55,876
- I don't wanna sit Violet.

937
01:26:57,044 --> 01:26:58,337
I'm very scared.

938
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:00,381
- Don't be scared.

939
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:03,759
I told you I'll take care of everything

940
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:07,220
and I will,

941
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:08,806
but you have to trust me.

942
01:27:10,599 --> 01:27:13,394
Now, sit down.

943
01:27:15,312 --> 01:27:16,355
- Where's my father?

944
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:23,821
You killed Micheal, didn't you?

945
01:27:25,614 --> 01:27:27,450
- You're so lucky I'm your sister.

946
01:27:29,201 --> 01:27:31,870
Who else would have gone
through all the trouble for you?

947
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:33,622
They didn't want us to be together,

948
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:36,542
but now they can't stop us.

949
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:39,919
We'll be together forever.

950
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,546
- What do you mean?

951
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:42,673
- Here, hold this.

952
01:27:47,511 --> 01:27:48,511
Take it.

953
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:02,401
Now, all you have to do is drink.

954
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:06,739
You'll drink first,

955
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:11,702
and then I'll hold you
until you fall asleep.

956
01:28:12,703 --> 01:28:14,038
I'll have to hold you tight

957
01:28:14,955 --> 01:28:17,041
to stop you from thrashing around so much.

958
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:19,667
Then I'll drink,

959
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,880
and I'll lay down beside you

960
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:25,381
and hold your hand.

961
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:31,096
Now, drink.

962
01:28:40,105 --> 01:28:42,857
Oh, you bitch!

963
01:28:56,455 --> 01:28:58,374
I tried to make it easier for you,

964
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:04,337
but I guess we'll have to do it your way.

965
01:29:26,151 --> 01:29:27,194
Help!

966
01:29:40,165 --> 01:29:42,000
- Help.
- Grab my hand.
