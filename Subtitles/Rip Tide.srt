00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,892
Mom, I want to talk

36
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:20,414
to you about something.

37
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:21,707
Mom.

38
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,167
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, me, too, honey.

39
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,502
- I don't want to make you nervous,

40
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,838
But Morgana Ferzari is here.

41
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,840
- She wants to see how you do in the shoot.

42
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,341
Now, don't worry.

43
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:31,801
Just be professional, okay?

44
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:34,094
I was talking about college.

45
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,930
- Honey, we've been through this.
- Sofia.

46
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:37,328
Yeah, Madeline, wait over there

47
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,683
until Farriet is ready.

48
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,955
Right now we have exciting

49
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:41,185
things on the table...

50
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,811
A modeling contract most

51
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,396
girls can only dream of.

52
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,439
All our hard work

53
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
is gonna pay off.

54
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,442
Yeah, but I would still love to

55
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,402
apply, you know, have options.

56
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,758
Uh, lift it up.

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,072
Okay, turn to your right.

58
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,949
Stop. Okay.

59
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:58,118
This... will give you options.

60
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,079
- The latest proofs.

61
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,998
- Oh, excuse me.

62
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,521
Um, hey, you are

63
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:05,001
coming tomorrow, right?

64
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:08,546
Darling, we can't do everything.

65
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,464
Graduation's important.

66
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,737
I know, and so is a meeting

67
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:12,967
about your contract.

68
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,426
Yeah, she's ready.

69
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,970
- I'm ready.
- Let's go. I'm waiting.

70
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,809
Oh, this is futile!

71
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,061
None of this is gonna work.

72
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,269
Fashion Week is two weeks away.

73
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,105
Where are my others assistants?

74
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,360
Huh.

75
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:34,739
If you remove the wings,

76
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,407
you can let the simplicity of

77
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,034
the dress speak for itself.

78
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:41,579
And with this burnt rouge...

79
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,665
bring the eye from the hemline

80
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:46,083
through the bodice,

81
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,459
highlighting the neckline.

82
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:51,171
What a remarkable idea.

83
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,631
- No, I just...
- No, no, no, no.

84
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,216
Why stop at one outfit?

85
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,405
If I knew we had

86
00:02:55,406 --> 00:02:56,552
an expert in our midst,

87
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,429
- I would have relied on you earlier.

88
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,556
Morgana?

89
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:01,683
Cora Hamilton,

90
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:02,767
perhaps you should

91
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,539
just, uh, curate

92
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,270
the entire shoot.

93
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,375
Now, while I don't mind

94
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:08,439
letting Sofia's daughter

95
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,108
play dress-up,

96
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,609
- it might be stretching the friendship

97
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,279
Just a tad to give her my job.

98
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,615
Don't you think?

99
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,241
Cora?

100
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:20,826
Where are you going?

101
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,870
The dress.

102
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,330
<i>â™ª Ohh â™ª</i>

107
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,552

00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:39,700
Get away from me!

109
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,805
Stop!

112
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,570
Mom?

113
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,218
Um, Sofia wants to know

114
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,824
if you're all right.

115
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,366
Why can't she ask me herself?

116
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,994
She's on a call at the moment.

117
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,954
She's doing damage control.

118
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,497
Okay.

119
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,223
Happy 18th, Cora!

120
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,975
Sending you good vibes

121
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:27,685
from sunny Tea Tree.

122
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,520
Hope to see you soon.

123
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,313
All my love, Aunt Margot.

124
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,293
Did you see his shoes?

125
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,013
This is a general announcement.

126
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,473
Flight 1138 bound

127
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:48,891
for Sydney, Australia,

128
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,288
your departure gate

129
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:51,643
is now changed to gate 26.

130
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,841
What on Earth do you

131
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:01,946
think you're doing?

132
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,405
Do you think I wouldn't

133
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,823
notice a $7,000 charge

134
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,325
for plane tickets

135
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:07,785
to Australia?

136
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,578
- I have got a catastrophe on my hands

137
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,330
- That affects both of our reputations,

138
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,665
and you're running away.

139
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,834
Was this her idea?

140
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:15,960
- Aunt Margot's?

141
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,253
- Yeah, of course.
- I'm horrible.

142
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:19,338
She's the fun surfer aunt.

143
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,568
You know, I've barely heard

144
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:21,757
from her since Caleb died.

145
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,508
No, it wasn't her idea.

146
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,802
It was mine.

147
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,304
- She's always written and said

148
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,055
That I'm welcome to come stay whenever,

149
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,620
so I took her up

150
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:31,142
on the offer.

151
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,664
She said she'd

152
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:34,145
love to see me.

153
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,771
- What? Is that so surprising...

154
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,522
- Someone actually wanting to see me?

155
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,608
You know, taking a genuine

156
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,652
interest, asking them things,

157
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,654
- wondering what they think,
maybe listening to them?

158
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,884
I'm running New York's

159
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:46,073
top model agency,

160
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,116
one that will launch

161
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,117
you into a career

162
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,911
that will take care

163
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,662
of you your entire life.

164
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,163
Darling, I cannot give you

165
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,623
my attention all the time.

166
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,187
I don't want your attention

167
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:57,709
all of the time.

168
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,086
But maybe once, you could

169
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:00,420
have made an exception,

170
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,673
done something I wanted to do

171
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:04,883
that was important to me.

172
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,844
I missed most of my childhood,

173
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,595
missed my graduation

174
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,784
so I could be

175
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:10,931
where you wanted me,

176
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,309
when you wanted me there.

177
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,019
I've fit into your life,

178
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,729
and now I'm doing something

179
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,397
on my own terms.

180
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,648
Sweetie, I know

181
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:20,816
that you're upset,

182
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,464
but people like us

183
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:24,069
can't afford accidents.

184
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,863
- This was your chance to show Morgana

185
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,572
- And the industry, the
polished young woman

186
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,949
You've become,

187
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,327
not some melodramatic teen.

188
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:34,330
Why won't you listen to me?

189
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,789
- Even when your
daughter is plastered on

190
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,082
Every magazine in New York,

191
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,813
it's like you

192
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:40,502
still can't see me.

193
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,254
- Cora, you can't just always run away.

194
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,007
I am not running away.

195
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:46,988
I am running towards

196
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:48,927
something else, anything,

197
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,388
as long as it's not your idea.

198
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,912
Now, why don't you just go back

199
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:55,809
and do what you usually do...

200
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,374
Get on with your busy life

201
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,896
and forget about me?

202
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,409
<i>â™ª I got a little â™ª</i>

203
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,577
<i>â™ª secret in my heart â™ª</i>

204
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,787
Ladies and gentlemen,

205
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,498
this is your

206
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,166
first officer speaking.

207
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,001
- In a few minutes,
we will be commencing

208
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,503
Our descent into Sydney.

209
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,026
Cabin crew, prepare

210
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:26,506
the cabin for landing.

211
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,803
<i>â™ª Outside is black and white â™ª</i>

212
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,305
<i>â™ª We laying color on the floor â™ª</i>

213
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,369
That's her.

214
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,391
No way.

215
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:38,999
Good morning, miss.

216
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,104
We'll be landing soon,

217
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,563
so here's your next boarding pass.

218
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,358
It's gate 4.

219
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,944
Uh, I booked first class.

220
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,028
There's no first class

221
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,071
on a prop plane,

222
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,406
but I'm sure you'll have fun.

223
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,479
We'd better get out there.

224
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,064
It'll be smooth as glass.

225
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,954
You know, tai chi

226
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,685
is only beneficial

227
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,687
when you don't actively

228
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:05,647
work against it.

229
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,984
I'm not working against it.

230
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,778
It's working against me.

231
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,967
- It calms the mind.

232
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,741
Imagine how much calmer you'd be

233
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:17,326
if you did it really quickly,

234
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,619
finished, and could

235
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,870
do something else.

236
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,559
You seem to be

237
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,207
missing the point.

238
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,646
You used to hate

239
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:26,043
all this stuff.

240
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,732
The need for stillness

241
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,380
outweighed my ego.

242
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,424
Luckily, I don't have

243
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:33,425
that problem.

244
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:38,305
My life is a well-oiled machine.

245
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,849
All set to pick your

246
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,350
niece up this morning?

247
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:42,435
She doesn't get

248
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:43,477
in until tomorrow.

249
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,521
You said that yesterday,

250
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,481
and as its habit,

251
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:51,860
tomorrow is now today.

252
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,573
You've waited for 10 years

253
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:57,991
for her to come back,

254
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,910
and now you're gonna be late.

255
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,912
Breathe.

256
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,525
Cora?

257
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,278
Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

258
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,695
You're all grown up!

259
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,531
Sorry I'm late.

260
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,949
It's okay.

261
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,701
Oh, you're moving in, huh?

262
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,703
- Uh, got to be prepared for anything.

263
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,497
- All you'll need is your bathing suit.

264
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,874
Jump in.

265
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,669
You want to drive?

266
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,129
Oh.

267
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,361
Thanks for having me.

268
00:11:55,362 --> 00:11:56,716
Of course.

269
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,010
It was a wonderful surprise.

270
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,929
Last-minute trip, huh?

271
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,097
Yeah. You know, things

272
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,223
are so busy right now.

273
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,309
- If you get a chance for a
holiday, you got to take it.

274
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,686
Well, I'm glad you did.

275
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,272
So, what's the plan?

276
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:13,525
Oh, uh, no plan, really.

277
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,090
Just kind of gonna

278
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:16,612
see what happens.

279
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,009
What does your mom think

280
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,364
about you coming to stay?

281
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,762
Hey, you know, she thinks

282
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:22,117
it's a great idea.

283
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,329
Okay. Good.

284
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,747
How is your mom?

285
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,625
She's good. She's fine.

286
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:33,211
Just always working.

287
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,400
It's a shame she couldn't

288
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:35,547
come out last year.

289
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,761
I'm so sorry about Caleb.

290
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:45,474
Well, that's life.

291
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:46,725
I should call Sof anyway.

292
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:47,934
It's been too long.

293
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,811
Sof.

294
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,438
That's really nice, actually.

295
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,627
Nobody back home

296
00:12:52,628 --> 00:12:53,773
calls her that.

297
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,900
Old habits die hard.

298
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,031
You remember when you were

299
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:01,365
here last with your mom?

300
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,283
Yeah.

301
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,202
- Mom and I made a pact we'd come and visit

302
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,412
Every year after that trip,

303
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:11,500
but I guess life happened.

304
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,169
Well, you're here now.

305
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,651
<i>â™ª I had my cake â™ª</i>

306
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:19,090
<i>â™ª and you had your doubt â™ª</i>

307
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,510
<i>â™ª Long gone â™ª</i>

308
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:26,724
<i>â™ª My baby's gonna carry on â™ª</i>

309
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,184
<i>â™ª Long gone â™ª</i>

310
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:33,731
<i>â™ª My baby's gonna carry on â™ª</i>

311
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,985
Ohh.

312
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,738
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

313
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,619
- You better be the new paper boy, Owen.

314
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,288
Margs, I just need

315
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:50,914
you to hear me out, okay?

316
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,083
- I want to help you.
- Oh, do you hear that, Bee?

317
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,001
- Owen wants to help out.
- You can start with the bags,

318
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,712
- And then, you know, the lawn needs a mow.

319
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,838
- Sell me the surf school,
and I'll do you a good deal.

320
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,465
- You've only got one instructor left.

321
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,592
- The thing is just sitting there.

322
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,842
We had plenty of instructors

323
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,261
before you started stealing them.

324
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,137
And don't call me Margs. You
know how much I hate it.

325
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,598
Hello, little fish.

326
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,057
Cora, you remember

327
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,475
my mother-in-law, Bee?

328
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,851
Yes, of course.

329
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:12,977
It's very nice to see you.

330
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,438
You're all grown up.

331
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,106
- Listen, they
needed the work, okay?

332
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,775
Things have been drying up here for months,

333
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,735
and Tom's a good kid, but
you're wasting his talent

334
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:21,361
- on a handful of tourists.
- How many times

335
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,571
do we have to have this conversation?

336
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,030
- Let's get your luggage.
- Margs.

337
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:28,118
Margot.

338
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,994
- I'm just trying to help you.

339
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,204
Really?

340
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,207
Yeah. Really.

341
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,210
Because I do need help.

342
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,629
I'm overwhelmed.

343
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,921
I got all these surfboards,

344
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:40,985
and some of them

345
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:42,006
have a leg rope.

346
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,216
And I know it's called a leg rope,

347
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,301
but do I put it on my leg

348
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:45,343
or my ankle?

349
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,804
- And wet suits...
- I know they get wet,

350
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:47,929
But sometimes they're dry.

351
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,849
What does it all mean, Owen?

352
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,434
Right.

353
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,603
Okay. I'm done.

354
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,481
Everyone, I tried.

355
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,066
I'm done.

356
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,860
You have a nice visit, Cora.

357
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,320
- Hi.
- You're taller.

358
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,947
See you later, Bee.

359
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,345
I'm sorry, hon.

360
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:08,700
Just ignore him.

361
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,201
Ignore them both.

362
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,953
A heads up would have been nice.

363
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,247
- You don't have a mobile phone.
- What was I supposed to do?

364
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,583
Send a pigeon?

365
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,344
- I was gonna clean up today.

366
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,887
Oh.

367
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,765
Your place is very Boho-Chic.

368
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,433
It's not bad for

369
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,059
a couple of surfers, I guess.

370
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,228
Your aunt took out

371
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:37,354
the world championship

372
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,938
the year you were born.

373
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,398
- Really?
- Yeah.

374
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,150
And twice after that.

375
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,943
Margot is a world record holder.

376
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,278
I'm sure her mom has

377
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,571
bored her with that already.

378
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,947
Um, no, actually.

379
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,991
She has not.

380
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,035
I better get going.

381
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,411
This surf festival

382
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,746
is doing my nut.

383
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,914
All those geriatrics

384
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:57,040
organizing events.

385
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,667
- Someone is gonna pop their clogs.

386
00:15:58,709 --> 00:15:59,959
I'll leave you to it.

387
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,503
- Have fun.
- Okay.

388
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,629
Bye.

389
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,090
Uh, what's the festival?

390
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,488
Oh, well, surfing is

391
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:08,844
a way of life around here,

392
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,554
and this year is 100 years

393
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,680
since Bee's grandmother

394
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:12,764
paddled out

395
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,516
and surfed with the boys.

396
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,518
- Violet was a bit of a trailblazer.

397
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,396
So they're throwing her a party.

398
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,856
That's pretty cool.

399
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,128
Yeah. It is.

400
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,358
Now, come on.

401
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,609
- Let's get you to your room.

402
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,027
Uh, okay.

403
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,700
Nothing much has changed.

404
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:32,951
Your drawings are

405
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,160
still on the wall.

406
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,766
And I found some of

407
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,330
your kids' books.

408
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,207
- I better get that.

409
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,167
- Uh, the bathroom is down the hall.

410
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,419
The blue towels are yours.

411
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,628
Make yourself at home.

412
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,549
Hello?

413
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,009
How are you?

414
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,876
Why are you knocking?

415
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,461
You usually just walk in.

416
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,838
You have a guest.

417
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,714
- Well, should I ask what that is?

418
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,424
It's a welcome gift.

419
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,156
You know, the ocean, sunshine,

420
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:14,845
"Welcome to Australia."

421
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,826
You're gonna give a girl

422
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:18,765
from New York a dead fish?

423
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,059
Well, now it seems weird.

424
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,905
Oh! You're purdy.

425
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,740
- Owen dropped by this morning.

426
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,909
- Again?

427
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,035
Uh-huh.

428
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,474
Margot, you have a girl creeping

429
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:40,871
outside of your bathroom.

430
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,289
Oh, that's Chicka. She popped

431
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,665
in for lunch post-surf.

432
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,375
- 'Sup?
- Cora, this is Chicka,

433
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,418
who thinks my house is a hotel.

434
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,670
I ate your sandwich.

435
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,129
- Sorry.
- And this is Tom...

436
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,465
Blue Soul's surf instructor.

437
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,634
- How you going?

438
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,761
- H-How am I going where?

439
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,179
Did you want a coffee?

440
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,890
Yes, please.

441
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,812
Oh. Okay.

442
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:06,939
Belinda, no, no,

443
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,023
no, no, no.

444
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,067
No chickens in the kitchen.

445
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,317
Oh!

446
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,986
Honey, honey.

447
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,217
- Can you...? Thank you.

448
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:15,405
- N... uh.

449
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,489
Yeah.

450
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,532
- Okay, it's...

451
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,826
- So, what did Owen want?

452
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:20,077
Oh, the usual.

453
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,286
He wants to buy Blue Soul Surf,

454
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,331
the kit, you, our contracts.

455
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,562
And what did you say?

456
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:27,751
She said yes.

457
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,168
Owen's your father now.

458
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,588
I said no.

459
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,860
Cora, did you want to,

460
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,091
you know,

461
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,592
check out the rock pools?

462
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,301
- You used to love them
when you were a kid.

463
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,887
Oh, uh, thank you,

464
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,180
but I should actually

465
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:41,431
really check in back home.

466
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,474
Um, what's your Wi-Fi?

467
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,812
What?

468
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,314
Margot doesn't

469
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,774
have the Internet.

470
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,442
Doesn't have the Internet?

471
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,318
- Like, I-is that 'cause you
call it something else...

472
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,237
- Kangaroo line or something?

473
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,405
No, I'm just not great

474
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,531
with things like that.

475
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,076
Things like the 21st century?

476
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,119
It's nice not having

477
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
to be connected

478
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,122
to the rest of the world when I'm at home.

479
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,790
It helps my Zen.

480
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,083
Zen?

481
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,960
But Tom set up Wi-Fi at Blue Soul,

482
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,899
So you can, you know, pop down

483
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,797
there whenever you like.

484
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,006
Great. Yeah.

485
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,550
Uh, I'll just... I'll go change.

486
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,014
Are you gonna get changed, too?

487
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,475
'Cause I'm just gonna wear this.

488
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,023
Popping candy?

489
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,445
Every time I eat them, I just...

490
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,989
I imagine a bunch of guys

491
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,490
in suits in a boardroom

492
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,075
surrounded by takeaway boxes.

493
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,702
They're tired,

494
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,411
but then this one guy slams
his hand on the desk,

495
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,747
and he says,

496
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:30,040
"I got it!

497
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,332
A candy that when you eat it

498
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,834
makes the sound

499
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,293
of frying onions!"

500
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,129
Then the other guys are like, "Wow!

501
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,216
Yes! Good idea, Steve!"

502
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,446
Oh, I just... just

503
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:41,634
love popping candy.

504
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,057
So, who are you talking to?

505
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,600
I'm not talking to anyone.

506
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,144
Margot says you're

507
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:52,645
a bit of a fashionista.

508
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,043
Yeah, yeah,

509
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:55,398
I'm a model, actually.

510
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,316
Sweet.

511
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,443
I know a guy in New York.

512
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,947
His name's Patrick.

513
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,491
You know him?

514
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,764
There are over 8 million

515
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:07,994
people in New York.

516
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,662
Mm-hmm.

517
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,414
He always wears a hat.

518
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,170
No.

519
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,172
- I'll let you get back to your mates.

520
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,145
Hey, Mom.

521
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,918
I think I really focused up

522
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,648
on the plane here.

523
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,483
So, um...

524
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,452
I've just been...

525
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,162
I've been feeling...

526
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,831
I just...

527
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,437
Why don't you give me

528
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:57,001
a call when you get this?

529
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,836
You've reached the
office of Sofia Hamilton,

530
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,588
New York's premiere modeling agent.

531
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,257
Please leave a message.

532
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,804
Everything all right?

533
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:11,390
Yeah. Fine. Just tired.

534
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,609
Max... e-mail...

535
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,444
Is okay with your short
list for Wednesday's job.

536
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,925
- No response.

537
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:26,364
- Jennifer...

538
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,907
Cellphone voicemail... wants...

539
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,408
- Anything from Cora?

540
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,954
No. Nothing from Cora.

541
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,331
What else?

542
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,333
- Dobrovski...
- Cellphone text...

543
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,625
"Moved meeting to Tuesday morning."

544
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,377
You're free.

545
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,087
Book it in.

546
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,932
What's wrong?

547
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,059
Something's bothering Cora.

548
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,727
- I think a code coconut is in order.

549
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,522
Well...

550
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,982
We'll need helmets.

551
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,421
Chicka was definitely

552
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:03,818
concussed last time.

553
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,539
Batter up!

554
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,291
- They can't be serious.
- Come on!

555
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,583
- Whoo!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

556
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,752
You can't be serious!

557
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,463
Whoa!

558
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,090
What am I supposed to do?

559
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,383
You've got a bat, woman.

560
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,634
Hit it.

561
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,511
You could have killed me.

562
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,763
It's all right.

563
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:32,972
We've got helmets on.

564
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:37,060
Eye on the coconut.

565
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,103
- It'll make you feel better.
- I promise.

566
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,647
Aim to hit it from underneath.

567
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,148
- Better about what?

568
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,566
Better about whatever you need

569
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:44,942
to feel better about.

570
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,777
- Now, go low!
- She's gonna lollipop it!

571
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,614
- Go!
- Whoo!

572
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,492
Come on!

573
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,618
<i>â™ª You run â™ª</i>

574
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,747
<i>â™ª You run from me â™ª</i>

575
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,290
Whoo-hoo!

576
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,091
<i>â™ª You run from me â™ª</i>

577
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,842
<i>â™ª You run â™ª</i>

578
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:10,885
<i>â™ª You run â™ª</i>

579
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,803
<i>â™ª You run from me â™ª</i>

580
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:16,557
<i>â™ª You run from me â™ª</i>

581
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,808
<i>â™ª You run â™ª</i>

582
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,935
<i>â™ª You run â™ª</i>

583
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,312

584
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:45,253
<i>â™ª 'Cause I â™ª</i>

585
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,422
<i>â™ª 'Cause I know â™ª</i>

586
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,925
<i>â™ª You run, you run, â™ª
â™ª You run from me â™ª</i>

587
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,114
Come on.

588
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:53,261
It's time for the best part!

589
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,346
- Whoo!
- Catch you later!

590
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:58,682
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

591
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,559
Come on!

592
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,562
What about sharks or jellyfish?

593
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,482
- When's the last time you went swimming?

594
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,691
In the ocean?

595
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,026
As a kid.

596
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,987
- The last time I was here, probably.

597
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,196
Well, then, it's about time.

598
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,657
It's nice as!

599
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,311
The air's different here.

600
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,688
I mean, it's, like, perfume.

601
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,002
It's a bit different

602
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:30,274
from New York, huh?

603
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,026
Margot said you model.

604
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,320
Yeah, yeah.

605
00:27:33,321 --> 00:27:34,571
Teen fashion, mostly,

606
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,364
but Mom's been training me for editorial.

607
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,616
Training? How hard can it be?

608
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,950
- Chicka.
- What?

609
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,619
You just lie around in clothes.

610
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,558
I do that all the time.

611
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,456
I'm doing it right now.

612
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,041
Yeah, it's... it's okay.

613
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,667
A lot of people think it's easy.

614
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,440
It actually requires

615
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:52,171
a surprising amount of work.

616
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,319
Sof must be

617
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,424
very proud of you.

618
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,426
Yeah, well...

619
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,968
- I might take a break from...

620
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,513
Modeling soon, anyway.

621
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,473
Yeah, I don't blame you.

622
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,850
That video was pretty mean.

623
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,977
I mean...

624
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,854
It wasn't that bad.

625
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,255
Yeah, look, there are

626
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:14,611
a lot of people

627
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,154
who work really hard

628
00:28:16,155 --> 00:28:17,655
to get the cover shoot.

629
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,511
If you make one mistake,

630
00:28:19,512 --> 00:28:21,325
even if it's a little one,

631
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,327
it's the end of the world.

632
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,246
You know, it seems like you're

633
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,518
the most important person

634
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,748
in the room.

635
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,126
In actuality, you're nobody.

636
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,029
You can't be perfect

637
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,926
all the time.

638
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,886
- I know a thing or two
about making mistakes

639
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,639
in front of a critical audience.

640
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,806
Oh, yeah.

641
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:44,932
Like that time you wiped out

642
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,767
- in the Wahine's Women's Open.
- Chicka.

643
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,207
What? It was in the heats,

644
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,604
not even the final,

645
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,960
and she just, like,

646
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:52,273
completely ate it.

647
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:53,817
Thank you.

648
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:55,318
I forgot about that.

649
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,445
I did wipe out more than once.

650
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,696
Mm-hmm.

651
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,156
But every time I made a mistake,

652
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,658
I learned something...

653
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,576
Something about my technique

654
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,453
or my attitude,

655
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,455
who to trust.

656
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:08,831
Exactly.

657
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,894
And who cares what

658
00:29:09,895 --> 00:29:10,916
those fancy pantses

659
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,669
in New York think, anyway?

660
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,172
I know it sounds silly,

661
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,592
but where I come from,

662
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,136
the fashion that we wear,

663
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:22,637
it's... it's just art.

664
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,138
It's pure art.

665
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,369
You should see what

666
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,557
these designers do.

667
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,434
They don't just buy fabrics

668
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,269
and follow a pattern.

669
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,730
I mean, they're architects.

670
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,231
They... They research,

671
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,670
and they're always

672
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:37,067
hunting down new materials

673
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,800
and seeking out ways to make it

674
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:42,490
all come together, you know?

675
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:45,576
You sound very passionate.

676
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,641
Yeah, I mean, it's

677
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:49,664
just my observations.

678
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,187
Here's an idea... Why don't you

679
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:52,667
two go for a surf tomorrow?

680
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,503
It's gonna be a beautiful day.

681
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,692
Sweet.

682
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:57,838
Yeah, let's do it.

683
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,674
I can't surf.

684
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:01,258
Oh, well, that's all right.

685
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,468
Neither could I before

686
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,636
I went out the first time.

687
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,437
Up.

688
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,692
Upright. Okay.

689
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:18,901
Move this back foot.

690
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,737
Breathe in.

691
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:23,364
Feel the movement of the water.

692
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,241
You are a part of the sea.

693
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,909
You are the current.

694
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,370
You are a jellyfish.

695
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,914
You are at one with the ocean.

696
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,415
You're a dolphin.

697
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,916
I don't think this is working.

698
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,251
Oh, well, this is

699
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,544
how Margot taught me.

700
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,045
Yeah, speaking of Margot,

701
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,630
maybe she can come out with us next time.

702
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,069
Open your eyes!

703
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,466
And go, Cora! Go!

704
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,010
Paddle! Paddle!

705
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,849
- Yeah, girl!

706
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:59,858
Whoo! Go, Cora!

707
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,167
Hello?

708
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:17,876
- Margot.

709
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,087
Sof.

710
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,965
Hey, uh, how are you?

711
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,759
Fine.

712
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,177
Well, as fine as you can be

713
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,553
when your daughter skips town.

714
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,263
Oh, I thought as much.

715
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,723
Didn't seem like you to push

716
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,141
for a last-minute holiday.

717
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:35,666
I haven't heard

718
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:36,687
from you in a while.

719
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,522
I have tried to call.

720
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,359
- Did you get the flowers I sent for...

721
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,069
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

722
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,989
Thanks.

723
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,805
I meant to call back,

724
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:51,452
but, well, you know...

725
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,623
So, Cora grew up.

726
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,124
She's great, Sof.

727
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,835
She's... She's gorgeous.

728
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,691
Yeah, she is.

729
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:02,505
Is she all right?

730
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,131
Not getting in your way?

731
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,258
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

732
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,760
I mean, she was...

733
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,553
She was a bit out of
sorts when she arrived,

734
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,597
but actually, she's out surfing right now.

735
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,307
Wow. That sounds dangerous.

736
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:14,975
It's strange.

737
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,790
It's kind of like having

738
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,562
my teen sister back again.

739
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,147
How's your, uh...
How's your work?

740
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,649
Uh, busy. How about you?

741
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,422
Yeah, yeah, tied up

742
00:32:23,423 --> 00:32:25,152
with things here.

743
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:28,071
So, have you sold Blue Soul?

744
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,406
Why would I do that?

745
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,867
I thought it wasn't going so well.

746
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:32,243
You don't know how

747
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:33,577
it's going, actually.

748
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,787
It's just basic business principle.

749
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,038
It doesn't have to be personal.

750
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,748
Of course it's personal.

751
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,002
Isn't that why you deigned

752
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:42,169
to visit us last time?

753
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:43,754
Because you were struggling with work,

754
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,006
And you needed a break? Because
sometimes it's personal.

755
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,550
I'm sorry to cut this short,

756
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,593
But I'm being hassled

757
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:51,595
by my next appointment.

758
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,743
I just wanted to see

759
00:32:52,744 --> 00:32:53,848
if Cora was all right.

760
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,683
I'm glad she's okay and that

761
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:57,476
you're both having fun together.

762
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,061
I'll talk to you later.

763
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,105
Okay. Sof, I...

764
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:05,735
Sof?

765
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:14,451
Cora. You're doing well.

766
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,495
I think
Chicka's trying to kill me

767
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:18,121
and make it look like an accident.

768
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,916
I've seen worse first attempts.

769
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,041
Well, thanks.

770
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,861
Who are they?

771
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:29,049
- Wave Masters.

772
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,593
Only other surf school in Tea Tree.

773
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,261
- Come on, guys. Let's go.
- Come on.

774
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,512
All right, grab it now.

775
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:34,722
Now, let's move it, move it.

776
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,434
- Come on, guys. Follow me.
- We're heading down to the beach.

777
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,936
Let's go, go, go.

778
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,020
Hey, that guy was at
Margot's the other day.

779
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,647
Yeah, Owen.

780
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,003
He's been trying to get Margot

781
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:46,316
to sell for a while.

782
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,110
She's having none of it.

783
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,532
You want to boost my numbers?

784
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,034
Join my lesson tomorrow?

785
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,536
Tell you what, if Chicka

786
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:58,537
gets taken by a shark,

787
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,289
you will be my first call.

788
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,632
Before you say anything,

789
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:10,883
this wasn't my idea.

790
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:12,114
I didn't want to be the head

791
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:13,302
of the festival committee.

792
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,366
No, Frank, we are not having

793
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,389
a Guess Your Weight stand.

794
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,057
Why not?

795
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,978
Beryl, how much do you weigh?

796
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,667
- Excuse me.

797
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:25,314
- That's why.

798
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,983
I thought Dolores was
head of the committee.

799
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,234
Well, she was until she had

800
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:29,443
the nerve to jump ship.

801
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,611
Dolores has moved?

802
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:31,737
She's on holiday.

803
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,363
She's in Cairns.

804
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,865
The details are not important.

805
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,533
We just have to band together,

806
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,452
and if I'm stuck with them,
you're stuck with them.

807
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:39,912
What's wrong with your house?

808
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,163
Darling!

809
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,372
Wonderful!

810
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,708
We need your fashion eye.

811
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,585
This is the one I was talking about.

812
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,420
She works in fashion

813
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,213
in New York.

814
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,882
We are putting together

815
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:53,509
a vintage swimsuit display

816
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,803
that spans 100 years.

817
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:57,326
What do you think?

818
00:34:57,327 --> 00:34:58,806
We can't get it to work.

819
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,183
It's not supposed

820
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:01,517
to hang like a sack.

821
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,977
Yeah, uh, I don't

822
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:06,396
really do this, so...

823
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,065
I'll... I'll let you guys to it.

824
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,692
- No, no, no, no.

825
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,298
Don't you worry about

826
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:12,862
hurting our feelings.

827
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,780
What do you think?

828
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,826
I mean, honestly?

829
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:21,370
Yes, yes, darling.

830
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,666
Hmm.

831
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,480
Ready, Mommy?

832
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,838
To begin, I'm gonna need

833
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,276
a sewing machine.

834
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:59,199
Now, the idea is to show

835
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,242
different eras

836
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:01,243
of swim wear fashion,

837
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,161
but all ideas are welcome.

838
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:06,082
Aha! Here we go.

839
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:09,752
Ohh! Now...

840
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,837
this was Grandma Violet's,

841
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,797
given to me by my mother,

842
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,926
and now I'm giving it to you.

843
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,469
- Ohh! Ohh!

844
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,970
- Careful.

845
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,014
Have fun with it.

846
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,182
Go wild.

847
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:24,307
- Yeah.

848
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,143
No one's ever really asked

849
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,937
for my opinion before.

850
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,313
More fool them.

851
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,565
- Do you got it?
- Yeah.

852
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:33,525
- Shall I help?
- No. Arm day.

853
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,235
All right, I'll stand behind
you in case you drop it.

854
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,828
Ah, she's flying.

855
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,955
It's beautiful.

856
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:29,915
It's like a dance.

857
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,834
It's 'cause they're
working together...

858
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,585
Surfer and the sea.

859
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,087
Can't tell with the wave ends

860
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,546
and she begins.

861
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,326
First thing... We're gonna need

862
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:46,723
some awesome surfer girls.

863
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,100
Can you help me with that?

864
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:49,226
Yeah. You're looking

865
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:50,310
at one, sister.

866
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,063
Second...

867
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:56,192
Can you keep a secret?

868
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,734
Sealed.

869
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:05,742
<i>â™ª Yes, I'll come back to you â™ª</i>

870
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,308

874
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,924
<i>â™ª Then I'll ask, â™ª</i>

875
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,343

881
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,399

882
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,109

885
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,697

886
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:26,198

887
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,929

00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,618
<i>â™ª coming on the right side â™ª</i>

889
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,982
Thought this might get

890
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:22,504
the creative juices flowing.

891
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,155
These are really good.

892
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:49,614
Thank you.

893
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:50,657
Do you see them

894
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:51,658
in your head first

895
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,993
and then draw it,

896
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:54,286
or does it just happen?

897
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:56,288
Yeah, yeah, I see them in my head.

898
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,791
Well... Or I feel it, actually.

899
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,959
- Feel it?

900
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,085
- Yeah.

901
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,754
I imagine what it would feel

902
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:05,381
like if I was wearing it.

903
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:10,344
Hello?

904
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:13,430
Whoa! And goodbye.

905
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,849
Chicka, wait.

906
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:16,975
Come here.

907
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,397
I need you to be my model.

908
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,605
What?

909
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,400
Little, old me?

910
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,880
I thought you'd never ask.

911
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,782
It's, uh, nice.

912
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,743
It's not exactly what I was going for.

913
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,140
Hmm...

914
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:37,495
Maybe if I strike a pose.

915
00:41:38,852 --> 00:41:40,165
Ohh! Sorry!

916
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:41,750
We need functionality,

917
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,293
not just aesthetics.

918
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,837
I could skate down the runway.

919
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,256
Whoo!

920
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,590
- No!

921
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:49,883
- Aah!

922
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,855
Need a hand?

923
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,274
No.

924
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:31,151
Thank you.

925
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,198
We have a, uh...

926
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,283
A certain percentage of...

927
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,723
Of customers that will

928
00:43:40,724 --> 00:43:43,121
only seem to book once.

929
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:44,164
Is that a statement,

930
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,624
or do you want my opinion?

931
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,001
Well, you've never been one

932
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,794
to keep your opinion to yourself.

933
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:55,467
Well, in that case,

934
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:56,531
maybe you should stop

935
00:43:56,532 --> 00:43:57,553
running your lessons

936
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,492
like a military exercise

937
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:01,390
and let people have some fun.

938
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,870
That's all fun and games until

939
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:04,309
someone runs out of business.

940
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:10,899
- What is this?
- What is it?

941
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,650
This music...
I'm nearly falling asleep here.

942
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,027
It's the blues.

943
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,988
Yeah, I'll say. Shocking.

944
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,323
Oh, here we go.

945
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,867
You're gonna like this.

946
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:26,289
That's better.

947
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,874
We never have,

948
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,709
and we never will agree on music.

949
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,107
Mm-hmm.

950
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:32,462
Come on.

951
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:33,671
No. The '90s are over.

952
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,298
You need to let them go, Owen.

953
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,092
Come on.

954
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,757
We had some good times...

955
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,717
You, me, and Caleb.

956
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:20,969
Yeah.

957
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,805
We were pretty blessed.

958
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:27,725
Sometimes I feel like he's...

959
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,395
I feel like he's slipping away.

960
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:33,815
He's still out there, Margs.

961
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,066
I feel him every time

962
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,276
I paddle out.

963
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:18,901
Hold your horses, kiddo.

964
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,903
Oh, hey. Just gonna go catch up to Margot.

965
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,280
Why don't you put

966
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:23,615
these on instead?

967
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:25,241
We... I would, but she's...

968
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,806
Margot isn't gonna

969
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:28,328
go for a surf.

970
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,205
- Uh, she just walked down.
- I just saw her.

971
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,123
Well, that's true,

972
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:34,000
but she won't go out.

973
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:35,835
What's she doing, then?

974
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,504
The same thing she's done

975
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:39,130
every day for the last year.

976
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,653
She doesn't go

977
00:46:40,654 --> 00:46:42,133
in the water anymore.

978
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,989
Wait, she... she hasn't

979
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,803
surfed in a year?

980
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,847
I thought she was a pro surfer...
the trophies.

981
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,807
Well, she is, darling.

982
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:52,310
That... That doesn't make sense.

983
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,103
Sometimes when we're hurting,

984
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,397
The last thing we want to do

985
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:56,961
is what will make us

986
00:46:56,962 --> 00:46:58,483
feel better.

987
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,944
Is she scared because of

988
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:03,363
what happened to Caleb?

989
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:05,240
When I was a kid, we had this big,

990
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,824
old eucalyptus tree in the garden.

991
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,993
It was beautiful. It had
a little magpie in it,

992
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,203
And every morning,

993
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,371
it would warble away.

994
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,955
For five years, I was sent to school

995
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,415
To the sound of that

996
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:15,833
happy, little fellow.

997
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,628
One day, my father got an ax,

998
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,213
and he chopped the tree down.

999
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,673
I was devastated.

1000
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:22,862
No more branches to cast

1001
00:47:22,863 --> 00:47:24,008
shadows on the wall.

1002
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,595
No more Mr. Magpie.

1003
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,054
We got a pool...

1004
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:29,723
An above-ground monstrosity.

1005
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:31,412
Well, it was so hot

1006
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:33,059
the pavements were melting,

1007
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,394
and I still refused

1008
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:35,687
to get in it.

1009
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:37,021
Why did you hate the pool?

1010
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,732
Because if I'd got in the pool,

1011
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:40,129
it would be like I was okay

1012
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,484
with the tree being gone,

1013
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:42,903
and I wasn't.

1014
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:44,279
I was still angry.

1015
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,239
But I realized there were
things to be happy about,

1016
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,033
And that put the sad

1017
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,785
things into perspective.

1018
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,494
Things happen and they change us

1019
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:54,456
and we can't control that.

1020
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,228
What you can control

1021
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:57,959
is how they change you.

1022
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:02,046
I'm sorry about Caleb.

1023
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,298
And about your tree.

1024
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,341
Oh, don't be.

1025
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,655
Now, 4:00 p.m. tomorrow,

1026
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:07,927
Chicka says

1027
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,262
she's lined up some girls

1028
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:10,555
for the fitting.

1029
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,724
Oh, yeah. Uh...

1030
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:14,122
You'll be fine.

1031
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:15,477
Walk this way.

1032
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,811
Now... Now, come over

1033
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:18,104
here to me,

1034
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,897
- and you see up here?
- That's what I'm doing.

1035
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,399
You just nip those off.

1036
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:35,705
- Cora! Whoo!

1037
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,248
- Hey.
- Hey!

1038
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,666
Yeah!

1039
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,042
- Okay.

1040
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:42,838
Ooh, check it out, girls.

1041
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:45,632
I thought we were

1042
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:46,800
getting bikinis.

1043
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:48,406
No, uh, bikinis weren't

1044
00:48:48,407 --> 00:48:49,969
invented until the '40s.

1045
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,283
Your outfit is inspired

1046
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:52,555
by the Edwardian Era.

1047
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:07,821
Ta-da!

1048
00:49:07,863 --> 00:49:09,489
What are you doing?

1049
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:10,845
It's heaps better.

1050
00:49:10,846 --> 00:49:12,158
Now you can see my legs.

1051
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,870
Oh, is it? Is it heaps better?

1052
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:16,225
Well, is there anything else

1053
00:49:16,226 --> 00:49:17,539
you'd like to make heaps better?

1054
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,956
No. What? No.

1055
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,500
I didn't realize Tea Tree Beach was home

1056
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:22,168
to such a fashion expert.

1057
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,837
Uh, I just thought that...

1058
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:25,005
Why don't you take over

1059
00:49:25,006 --> 00:49:26,130
and design the whole thing?

1060
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,569
Come on, Cora.

1061
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,966
She didn't mean to upset you.

1062
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,886
Dressing up is supposed to be fun.

1063
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:32,846
You think this is just dress-up?

1064
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:37,517
What's her problem?

1065
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,645
Ah!

1066
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,856
What's going on in there?

1067
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:44,816
She ruined my design.

1068
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:46,067
And talking to her like

1069
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:47,276
that's gonna fix it?

1070
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,070
She hacked it to pieces.

1071
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,217
Well, I don't know.

1072
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:51,322
Does she have a point?

1073
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:53,074
- A point?
- It's like you people

1074
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,304
Don't know anything

1075
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:55,493
about beauty or design.

1076
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:57,412
"You people."

1077
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,788
It's these people that have embraced you

1078
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,186
And asked you to help out

1079
00:50:00,187 --> 00:50:01,541
with their festival.

1080
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,376
What have your people done for you, Cora?

1081
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,003
Pushed you around,

1082
00:50:05,004 --> 00:50:06,588
spread rumors about you?

1083
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,506
You're right. My people

1084
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:10,383
are nothing like your people.

1085
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,928
And I'm fine with that.

1086
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,589
Thanks,

1087
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:29,861
but I'm not hungry.

1088
00:50:29,903 --> 00:50:31,738
Well, I'll just leave

1089
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:33,573
it here, then.

1090
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:35,367
Aunt Margot, did you

1091
00:50:35,368 --> 00:50:37,118
and Caleb ever fight?

1092
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:43,040
Never.

1093
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,627
Yes.

1094
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,587
Oh, all the time.

1095
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:49,527
Blue Soul nearly killed us

1096
00:50:49,528 --> 00:50:51,424
more than once.

1097
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:53,114
Why do you keep

1098
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:54,761
running it, then?

1099
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:58,055
It's all I have left of him.

1100
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:00,558
Is that why you hate Owen?

1101
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,728
I don't hate Owen.

1102
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,730
The three of us were great friends.

1103
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:09,839
Owen was there surfing

1104
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,903
with Caleb the day that he died.

1105
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,199
I heard the fitting didn't go so well.

1106
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,494
Ugh! Yeah.

1107
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,766
I kind of lost it.

1108
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:21,997
You're passionate.

1109
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:23,623
Don't apologize for that.

1110
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:27,002
You just need a bit of patience.

1111
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:31,547
I don't know.

1112
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,195
I-I constantly just feel like

1113
00:51:33,196 --> 00:51:34,801
I'm saying the wrong thing.

1114
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:36,636
It takes courage

1115
00:51:36,637 --> 00:51:38,429
to speak your mind.

1116
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,202
Our family makes strong women,

1117
00:51:40,203 --> 00:51:41,933
and you're one of them.

1118
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:44,727
Be proud of that.

1119
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,355
That chicken.

1120
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,065
Belinda! No!

1121
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,400
Out, out, out,

1122
00:51:50,401 --> 00:51:51,693
or I will cook you!

1123
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:14,841
Chicka. Hey.

1124
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:17,927
I owe you an apology.

1125
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,971
I'm sorry about yesterday.

1126
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:21,639
You were real mad.

1127
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:23,266
I thought you might explode

1128
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:24,851
into a thousand pieces.

1129
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:26,352
I know.

1130
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:27,791
Do you think the others

1131
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,188
might forgive me?

1132
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,440
We're going out to surf
soon if you want to join.

1133
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,693
Yeah, I'd love to.

1134
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:35,194
You looking for Tom?

1135
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,030
He's on the beach. And don't worry.

1136
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:38,198
He's not one to

1137
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:39,323
bear grudges, either.

1138
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:43,411
Here.

1139
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,831
Thank you.

1140
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,555
Hey.

1141
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,640
Hey.

1142
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,186
They won't hurt you.

1143
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,316
Whoo.

1144
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,131
They're beautiful.

1145
00:53:16,132 --> 00:53:17,904
Whose are they?

1146
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:20,406
Don't know.

1147
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,787
Hey, listen, I was thinking,

1148
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,726
and I might bring out

1149
00:53:27,727 --> 00:53:29,624
a line of bikinis, after all.

1150
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,167
That's a shame.

1151
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,794
Kind of liked the knee-length look.

1152
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:56,711
Hello?

1153
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,537
Hey.

1154
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:32,705
Hey.

1155
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,540
This place is incredible.

1156
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:38,294
These boards are amazing.

1157
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,566
Margot really wouldn't

1158
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:40,796
like you being in here.

1159
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,174
This is so beautiful.

1160
00:55:43,216 --> 00:55:45,593
I almost thought

1161
00:55:45,594 --> 00:55:47,970
it would have a heartbeat.

1162
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,889
It's not finished.

1163
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:52,433
I need to, um...

1164
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,060
It needs to be finished.

1165
00:55:54,102 --> 00:55:56,145
Wait, is this place yours?

1166
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:59,023
This was Caleb's workshop.

1167
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:01,442
Those are his boards.

1168
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,569
This one is mine.

1169
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:08,407
Wait, you design boards?

1170
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,701
You never asked.

1171
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:14,330
So, how come you haven't

1172
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:15,706
finished it, then?

1173
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:19,794
Can we come out of here?

1174
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,548
Yeah.

1175
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,853
Nice to have you home.

1176
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,939
Mm-hmm.

1177
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:42,566
It's good to be back.

1178
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,777
Are you sure?

1179
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:46,321
Sometimes I think

1180
00:56:46,322 --> 00:56:47,822
you prefer touring.

1181
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,617
Are you fishing

1182
00:56:50,618 --> 00:56:51,993
for something?

1183
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:56,580
I'm proud of you.

1184
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,748
Those waves in Indo...

1185
00:56:57,749 --> 00:56:58,874
They were big.

1186
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,459
Mm.

1187
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:04,046
And to be honest...

1188
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,841
I was really worried about you.

1189
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,092
You know if it's up to me,

1190
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:11,846
I will always come home.

1191
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,056
My wife,

1192
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:17,768
out taming monster waves.

1193
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,657
I love you.

1194
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,849
Ow! Belinda!

1195
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:00,144
No, no, no.

1196
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,159
Oh, no,

1197
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,285
you're not doing that today.

1198
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:17,870
Chicka, I really want to.

1199
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,580
Oh, but the surf's too good!

1200
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,083
And everyone's out.

1201
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,001
Even some by the name of Thomas.

1202
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,090
Hmm...

1203
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,426
Well, we better get going, then.

1204
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:33,094
Let's go.

1205
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:40,035
Um, this is very isolated.

1206
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,496
Should I be worried?

1207
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:43,143
No. It is a bit weird

1208
00:59:43,144 --> 00:59:44,748
around here, though.

1209
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,208
When I was a kid, I thought

1210
00:59:46,209 --> 00:59:47,626
a witch lived in these rocks.

1211
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:48,794
My brothers told me

1212
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:49,920
stories about her...

1213
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,839
How she drowned sailors

1214
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,945
and rode whales

1215
00:59:53,946 --> 00:59:56,010
to the bottom of the sea.

1216
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,970
Have you told me that before?

1217
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:00,264
Don't think so.

1218
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,187
It's cool, huh?

1219
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,483
Cora Hamilton!

1220
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,654
So, you still want

1221
01:00:14,655 --> 01:00:16,197
to make boards?

1222
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,969
Sort of forgotten

1223
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,700
about them, to be honest.

1224
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,556
I haven't been in the workshop

1225
01:00:21,557 --> 01:00:23,371
for about a year.

1226
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:24,830
Do you miss it?

1227
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:28,209
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1228
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,794
I love starting with nothing

1229
01:00:29,795 --> 01:00:31,337
and seeing it sort of reveal...

1230
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:34,382
Reveal itself to you.

1231
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:38,177
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

1232
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,514
I don't know.

1233
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:42,724
It kind of seemed

1234
01:00:42,725 --> 01:00:43,891
like he was in there

1235
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,976
waiting to be finished.

1236
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:47,124
- Who?

1237
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,229
- Your unfinished board.

1238
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,897
It's like he was just in there,

1239
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,169
waiting for you to come back

1240
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:52,400
in and finish him up.

1241
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:53,609
It's a "he," is he?

1242
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,694
Well, yeah.

1243
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:56,758
Well, a woman wouldn't

1244
01:00:56,759 --> 01:00:57,779
wait around like that.

1245
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:05,413
You did that.

1246
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,872
What?

1247
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:10,251
You don't remember, do you?

1248
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,253
Wait, that was you?

1249
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,795
You were that annoying boy

1250
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,423
that I used to chase around?

1251
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:18,426
Yes!

1252
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:20,177
- So I have been here before.
- Mm-hmm.

1253
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:22,137
And you've told me that story before.

1254
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,306
You tried to scare me

1255
01:01:23,307 --> 01:01:24,432
with the witch.

1256
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:26,058
Bet you can't catch me anymore.

1257
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:31,855
Okay.

1258
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:37,653
Huh.

1259
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,821
So a guy can wait around, then.

1260
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,261
I wasn't waiting for

1261
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:42,658
you to come back,

1262
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,701
but I'm glad you did.

1263
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:14,482
Hello, you've reached 1955.

1264
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,171
There's no Internet

1265
01:02:16,172 --> 01:02:17,818
but great gas prices.

1266
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,820
Darling, it's me.

1267
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,426
- Mom?

1268
01:02:21,427 --> 01:02:22,990
How are you?

1269
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,950
- Good. Great.
- That's good.

1270
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:26,244
It's lovely

1271
01:02:26,245 --> 01:02:27,495
to hear your voice.

1272
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:29,455
Yeah. Yours, too.

1273
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:30,665
I have to say the apartment

1274
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,291
is very quiet without you.

1275
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,563
But I have some

1276
01:02:33,564 --> 01:02:34,793
very exciting news.

1277
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,253
What's up?

1278
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:38,005
Well, I've been working like a dog

1279
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,423
to get you that contract,

1280
01:02:39,424 --> 01:02:40,799
and guess what.

1281
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:42,426
Morgana wants you to launch her

1282
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:44,512
upcoming New York campaign.

1283
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:47,828
So, uh, wait,

1284
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:49,016
what does this mean?

1285
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,184
This means

1286
01:02:50,185 --> 01:02:51,310
you have a new chance,

1287
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:53,061
and I think your trip to Australia has

1288
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,376
actually been a good thing

1289
01:02:54,377 --> 01:02:55,648
for both of us...

1290
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,066
A new perspective, some time

1291
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:58,442
away to work things out.

1292
01:02:58,484 --> 01:02:59,610
But you'll need to come home

1293
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:00,736
as soon as possible.

1294
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,778
Lily is booking flights

1295
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:02,779
as we speak.

1296
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,198
We can get you on a plane tonight.

1297
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,116
Wh... Tonight?

1298
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:09,203
Th... That's so soon. I-I can't.

1299
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,475
Morgana wants

1300
01:03:10,476 --> 01:03:11,706
to see you on Tuesday.

1301
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:12,769
Look, I'm sure

1302
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:13,790
the schedule is tight,

1303
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:16,711
but there's this festival...

1304
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:19,296
This is a chance for
you to wipe your slate clean,

1305
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:21,465
and I want to help you do that.

1306
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:22,508
Lily will send through

1307
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:23,509
the flight details.

1308
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:25,010
Oh, my appointment's here. I got to run.

1309
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,554
Call me on your way to the airport.

1310
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:29,056
Bye, darling.

1311
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:51,119
I can't believe this.

1312
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,829
What?

1313
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,314
That I actually thought that

1314
01:03:57,315 --> 01:03:59,545
I could stay here, have this.

1315
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:02,964
Have what?

1316
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,966
That was my mom.

1317
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,761
My modeling contract's back on,

1318
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:08,179
so I have to go

1319
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,555
back to New York.

1320
01:04:09,597 --> 01:04:12,266
You're leaving?

1321
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,893
I was always gonna have

1322
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:17,479
to leave eventually.

1323
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:18,772
You... You get some

1324
01:04:18,773 --> 01:04:20,023
modeling thing and you...

1325
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,316
You go?

1326
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,151
It's not just some modeling thing.

1327
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,424
I mean, it's...

1328
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:25,654
It's a really big contract.

1329
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:26,905
You know...

1330
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:30,075
If that's what you want.

1331
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,660
I've worked years for this.

1332
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:33,203
I thought modeling made you unhappy.

1333
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:35,831
It does. Sometimes. But...

1334
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:36,978
But what?

1335
01:04:36,979 --> 01:04:38,083
- I'm not like you.

1336
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,272
I can't just give up

1337
01:04:39,273 --> 01:04:40,419
a good opportunity

1338
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:43,338
because it got too hard.

1339
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,006
What does that mean?

1340
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:51,952
It means the keys

1341
01:04:51,953 --> 01:04:54,141
aren't locked up, Tom.

1342
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,017
Okay, nothing is stopping
you from going in there

1343
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,687
And finishing that board.

1344
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,190
Tom.

1345
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,782
Hey. What's wrong?

1346
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,599
I got the contract

1347
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,037
with Morgana Ferzari.

1348
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,081
Well, congratulations.

1349
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:24,004
But what about design?

1350
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,276
I'm really sick of people

1351
01:05:25,277 --> 01:05:26,507
telling me what is

1352
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:27,737
and is not my dream,

1353
01:05:27,738 --> 01:05:28,925
especially when no one here

1354
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,385
has the courage to actually
do what they love.

1355
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:31,887
I'm just saying don't be afraid

1356
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,305
to do the thing that's
gonna make you happy.

1357
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:35,140
Yeah, says the pro surfer

1358
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:36,933
who doesn't even surf.

1359
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,081
Look, I walk around

1360
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:39,186
this place and Blue Soul,

1361
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:41,000
and it's like I can

1362
01:05:41,001 --> 01:05:42,773
almost still feel Caleb.

1363
01:05:42,815 --> 01:05:44,713
But it's this dark

1364
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:46,610
and sad version of him.

1365
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:48,987
It's so heavy. No wonder you're
afraid to get in the water.

1366
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,614
You'll probably sink.

1367
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,157
I lost my husband.

1368
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:53,513
Yeah, you don't want

1369
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,827
to sell the school,

1370
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:56,161
but you don't want to run it.

1371
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:57,579
You don't want Tom to work with Owen,

1372
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:58,768
But you don't want him

1373
01:05:58,769 --> 01:05:59,915
to work for you.

1374
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,709
It's like you're stuck.

1375
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,461
Why don't you look around

1376
01:06:04,462 --> 01:06:05,962
and see all of the people

1377
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,964
who are willing to be stuck with you?

1378
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:34,282
Whoa. Sorry, miss.

1379
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,284
This is way too heavy. You can't take this.

1380
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:37,619
We got to go.

1381
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:38,954
Miss, we've a storm front coming in.

1382
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,164
Are you on or off?

1383
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,875
What do you want?

1384
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,047
Margot!

1385
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,258
Margot?

1386
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:36,971
Margot!

1387
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:50,400
Wait, Tom.

1388
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:52,068
I couldn't do it.

1389
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,320
I couldn't go.

1390
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:54,738
I'm so scared

1391
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,406
because I feel like

1392
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:58,012
I may have just ruined

1393
01:07:58,013 --> 01:07:59,576
the best things I've ever had.

1394
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:06,124
You haven't ruined it.

1395
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,012
I've got to go check the boats.

1396
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,305
There's a storm coming.

1397
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:22,182
Can you find Margot, tell her
I'll meet her at Blue Soul?

1398
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,059
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm?

1399
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:37,531
Margot.

1400
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:43,161
Her board.

1401
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:16,528
I love you.

1402
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,183
Caleb.

1403
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,792
Margot!

1404
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,760
Margot!

1405
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,855
Margot!

1406

Are you sure?

1407
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:08,637
So she didn't even

1408
01:12:08,638 --> 01:12:09,826
board the plane?

1409
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:15,290
Yeah, I see.

1410
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:18,085
Yes, I will notify Morgana.

1411
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,628
Yeah, good night.

1412
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:38,063
Ready, mommy?

1413
01:12:38,064 --> 01:12:39,189
We're ready.

1414
01:12:42,276 --> 01:12:44,152
It's going to be my new party dress.

1415
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:45,445
Wow, darling,

1416
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:46,696
it's certainly unique.

1417
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:47,989
It's wonderful.

1418
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:50,075
You're so creative, Cora.

1419
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:51,952
Is that sticky tape?

1420
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:54,412
Yep, and I used staples, too.

1421
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:56,331
It's perfect.

1422
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:57,707
Can you make me one?

1423
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:59,042
But you're a giant.

1424
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:00,752
Now, come on, model it

1425
01:13:00,753 --> 01:13:02,420
for us. Come on, darling.

1426
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:03,860
Keep your shoulders

1427
01:13:03,861 --> 01:13:05,257
back and chin up.

1428
01:13:05,299 --> 01:13:07,508
- Chin up.
- Look like you're having fun.

1429
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,552
Smile, Cora. Smile.

1430
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:10,929
You beam when you smile.

1431
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:12,160
I just wanted to show

1432
01:13:12,161 --> 01:13:13,348
you what I made.

1433
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,682
And it's fabulous.

1434
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,144
Sof, I don't think she wants to.

1435
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:18,561
Do it properly.

1436
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,396
Cora, do it like we practiced.

1437
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,065
Walk like this.

1438
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:23,441
Here. Copy me.

1439
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:24,609
Good girl.

1440
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,820
Oh, you pretty girl.

1441
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,906
I don't want to do it anymore.

1442
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,246
I didn't think I would ever

1443
01:13:56,247 --> 01:13:59,311
be ready to say goodbye.

1444
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:01,376

And I'm gonna be okay.

1449
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,451
So I'm letting you go, honey.

1450
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:42,330
Okay, girls,

- Chicka, boards sorted?
- Yes.

- And no one saw you?
- None.

What are you doing here?

1530
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:10,955
I came to apologize.

1531
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:12,812
For not listening to you

1532
01:19:12,813 --> 01:19:14,626
when you needed to be heard.

1533
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:16,816
Mom, my heart isn't

1534
01:19:16,817 --> 01:19:18,963
in modeling anymore.

1535
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:20,632
But that doesn't mean that I don't love you

1536
01:19:20,674 --> 01:19:22,217
and appreciate everything

1537
01:19:22,218 --> 01:19:23,759
you've done for me.

1540
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,410
rather than getting on a plane

1541

to fame and fortune,

1542
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:30,975
I guess they're trying

1543
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:31,976
to tell you something.

1544
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:36,606
I'm so proud of you.

1545
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:47,972
Deep down, I think I knew

1546
01:19:47,973 --> 01:19:49,661
modeling wasn't your first love.

1547
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:52,330
But you're my first love.

1548
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,374
And I wanted you to be as
close to me as possible

You know, designing's

1551
01:19:58,421 --> 01:19:59,462
no walk in the park.

1552
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:01,110
You've just jumped from

1553

the frying pan into the fire.

1554

My friend Patrick liked

1558

your designs on Instagram!

1559
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:12,099
Wait, Patrick Delamore?!

1560
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,644
Yeah! Yeah, I told you.

1561
01:20:14,686 --> 01:20:17,980
He's one of the most iconic fashion
photographers of our time.

1562
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,482
Oh, so you do know Patty Cakes?

1563
01:20:19,524 --> 01:20:20,983
Hey, I'll give you his number.

1564
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:22,694
Maybe he'll post some of your clothes.

1565

What are they doing?

1568
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:53,725
Something they
should have done ages ago.

1569

Margot's selling Blue Soul?

1570
01:20:55,226 --> 01:20:58,229
No. They're gonna join forces.

1571
01:20:58,271 --> 01:20:59,460
Margot's starting a pro

1572

surf school for women,

1573
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,316

1574
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:04,048
