Lai Lai Zhen,
abandoned at birth and left for dead:

144

At 17, she was killing
for the Triads

145
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,797
and has grown up to become
the number one hitter

An outstanding athlete,

151
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,115
he lives for the thrill of the hunt:

152
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,951
Silent, stealthy, smart--

153
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,320
a lethal option:

154
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,522

155
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,359
Yuri Petrov,

156
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,492
An incredible all-rounder
armed to the teeth:

157
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,833
Fists, feet, bullets, bombs--

158
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,429
utterly merciless,
he has it all:

159
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,839
Miles Slade, the crazy Texan kid:

160
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,347
An outside bet,

161
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,646
but he's mad enough
to rise the ranks:

162
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,845
Reckless, ruthless, wild,

163
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,013
but guaranteed great entertainment:

164
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,683
This is one guy
who truly loves his job:

165
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,361
And if you thought
it couldn't get any better,

166
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,193
we have a dramatic late entrant--

167
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,791
a returning champion
who I'm sure

168
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,964
will add something very
personal to the proceedings:

169
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,062
Seven years ago,

170
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,370
Joshua Harlow took
the Tournament by storm

171
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,807
and retired as a champion:

172
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,572
But this year he's back:

173
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,136
For one reason,
and one reason only--

174
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,176
revenge:

175
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,713
Joshua's wife was brutally murdered

176
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,583
in their Miami home
four months ago,

177
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,150
and the person who killed her

178
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,214
is one of this year's players!

179
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,888
Joshua Harlow is our
favorite at 2 to 1 :

180
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,557
[applause]

181
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,657
Activate tracking devices:

182
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,759
overlaying and synching positions:

183
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,862
- Tracking bugs online:
- Prepare to go hot:

184
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,167
Hotter than me in a swimsuit:

185
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,269
Cue:

186
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,777
As ever, each assassin

187
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,177
is implanted with a tracking device,

188
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,509
so we can find them,

189
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,311
and they can find each other:

190
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,218
But this year we've added
an extra pinch of spice:

191
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,916
If we don't have a winner
within 24 hours,

192
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,083
our contestants will discover

193
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,456
that their tracking device

194
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,927
isn't just a tracking device:

195
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,155
Well, I know you're all very busy men:

196
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,500
30 contestants:::

197
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,439
24 hours:::

198
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,565
one rule--

199
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,666
kill or die:

200
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,940
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets:

201
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,345
The Tournament has begun:

202

Rob:
Suck me sideways:

209
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,325
I would kill
for a piece of that pie:

210
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,631
Yeah, right:

211
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,332
You'd be fucking dead
before you could lick your lips:

212
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,036
Besides, somebody upstairs
has designs on her:

213
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,510
oh, yeah?
Is that so?

214
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,137
Uh-huh:
Yeah, kinda:

215
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,273
They go way back:
He nurtured her or something:

216
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,976
[beeping]

217
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,143
Tech: oh, oh, oh:

218
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,483
All right, it is showtime:

219
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,215
Rob: Holy shit:
Can you do that?

220
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,848
- Wow:
- He just killed an innocent guy!

221
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,085
Tech: Fuck! I love this shit:

222
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,093
- Fuck!
- Keep on him:

223
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,685
I'm locked on him:
Nowhere to hide:

224
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,355
Miss Hunter, it is showtime:

225
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,661
We have Tomko versus Zhen:

226
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,701
That is England v. China!

227
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,259
Good:
Patch it through:

228
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,032
Sir, we're off:

229
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,665
It's Steve Tomko and Lai Lai Zhen:

230
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,609
What the fuck are you up to?

231
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,747
[knock on door]

Who is it?

234
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,052
Room service:

235
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,284
Breakfast, madam:

236
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,583
[grunting]

237
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,486
You like that, bitch?
Huh?

238
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,362
[clicks]

239
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,502
I just want you to know,
after I kill you,

240
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,511
I'm going to fuck you:

241
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,779
[screaming]

242
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,793
[laughing]

243
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,727
Hey, welcome
to the tournament, Rob:

244
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,905
You fucking bitch!

245
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,265
Host:
First blood to Lai Lai Zhen:

246
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,462
[cheers and applause]

247
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,440
Her odds move to 7 to 1 :

248
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,474
Man: Yeah!

249
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,384
Man:

250
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,978
to the lvy House Hotel room 107.

251
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,216
Delta:
We're on our way.

252
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,315
Rob:
I still would:

253
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,586
- [alarm beeping]
- Confirm one body...

254
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,560
oh, okay, party time:

255
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,859
We have the Frenchman
Anton Bogart

256
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,831
heading into a cluster

257
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,390
- developing on the high street:
- Shit:

258
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,902
Activating all street security cams:

259
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,169
Picking it up on one,
two, three police cameras:

260
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,904
- The cameras live?
- Cameras are live:

261
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,741
We are in on the Gypsy:

262

00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,101
Fuck:
The Frenchman's gone cold:

266
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,233
I didn't see a fight:
You see him get killed?

267
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,538
no, I didn't see a fucking fight:

268
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,805
Doing a signal sweep:

269
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,039
Check his body heat sensor now:

270
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,102
I'm on it:

271
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,752
Tech: He's back:
What did you do?

272
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,053
Must've been a blip:

273
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,254
Run a complete diagnostic:
I don't like blips:

274
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,761
Top you off?

275
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,869
- Coffee?
- no:

276
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:41,900
Top you off?

277
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,878
There you go:

[cell phone rings]

00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,188
Yes:

280
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,518
No:

281
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,887

You planning to pay for that?

Yeah: Yes:

285
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,268
Credit card?

286
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,337
Here, Father:
Allow me:

287
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,305
Enjoy your coffee:

288
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,539
Au revoir.

Sorry I haven't been around:

I've been busy:
How's your mom doing?

296
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,819
She died, Father:

297
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,830
I-I'm sorry:

298
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,661
Todd:
She was asking after you:

299
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,260
Is there anything I can do,
like help with the funeral?

300
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,031
That's okay:
I've got it all sorted:

- Rob: oh, fuck:
- What?

304
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,245
I think we have another blip:

Shooter on the rooftop just went cold:

306
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,982
No one near her:

307
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,808
We've got a moving signal
but no Frenchman:

308
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,811
What the hell is going on?

309
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,506
- Come on:
- I'm looking, I'm looking:

00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,606
I fucking hate blips!

00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,946
Hail Mary, full of grace:

313
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,114
The Lord is with thee:

314
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,282
Blessed art thou amongst women,

315
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,121
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus:

316
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,128
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

317
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,664
now and in the hour
of our death, amen:

318
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,239
oh, please,
Blessed Virgin, hear me:

319
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,346
I want to be a good man:

320
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,521
I want to be a strong man:

321
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,018
But I look inside my heart
and there is nothing there:

322
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,024
There's nothing there:

323
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,061
oh, Blessed Virgin,
please give me hope:

324
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,879
I know:

325
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,922
What?

326
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,551
Whatever this is,
please, please:::

327
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,993
What's wrong with you?

328
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,429
What's wrong with me?

329
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,398
Please, hear me--

330
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,298
Why aren't you
defending yourself?

331
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,427
I don't have any money,
please:

332
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,471
- I don't have any money:
- Shut up:

333
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,200
I'm just a--
I'm just a priest:

334

[priest panting]

336
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,095
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,

337
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,660
goodbye:

338

[speaking Russian]

340
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,241
I'm going to enjoy this:

341
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,737
Priest:
Stop!

342
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,374
Stop:

343
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,142
Stop!

344
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,516
Please, don't struggle:

345
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,789
So much easier
when they don't struggle:

346
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,193
Priest:
What are you doing?

347
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,753
Just let her go!

348
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,264
I've got a gun!

349
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,301
I've got a gun and I'll use it:

350
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,838
- [cracks]
- Aah!

oh:::

352
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,412
Don't move:

353
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,576
or what?

354
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,247
Just-- just stay right there:

355
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,619
Stay back!

356
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,183
[clicks]

357
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,391
You need one in the chamber:

358
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,534
- Who are you?
- I'm a priest!

359
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,095
If you lie to me,
I break your neck:

360
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,697
I'm not:
I'm not!

361
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,936
Where are your weapons?
Who do you work for?

362
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,568
Where do you receive
your orders from?

363
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,612
Rome!

364
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,673
No scar:

365
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,411
I don't know
what you're talking about:

[beeping]

367
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,487
You're bleeping:

368
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,999
You really don't know
what I'm talking about, do you?

369
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,069
You really are a priest:

370
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,729
Father Macavoy:

371
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:21,309
This is--
was my church:

372
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,407
Well, Father,
welcome to the Tournament:

373
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,618
Thank you:

374
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,889
[cheers and applause]

375
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,880
[cheers and applause]

376
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,153
They found the blip:

377
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,161
What is it?

378
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,663
It's our Frenchman:

379
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,791
- Anton Bogart?
- It seems he managed

380
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,334
to cut out his tracking device,

381
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,461
and it's ended up inside that priest:

382
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,834
I see:

383
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,669
We now have one of our favorites

384
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,107
running around virtually invisible?

385
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,667
I'm sorry:
What shall I tell them to do?

386
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,839
I suggest you shorten his odds

387
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,507
and follow him:

388
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,550
Yes, sir:

389
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,345
Tech: okay, maintain
visual contact with Bogart:

390
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,685
Don't lose sight of that
slippery little bastard:

391
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,818
Tracking manually:
Damn, Bogart's quick:

392
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,987
Man:
Go to camera two. Quick, go.

393
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,291
Just got to reconfigure:

394
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,355

397
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,371
- It's him:
- You sure?

398
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,373
oh, there are gonna be fireworks:

399
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,705
All right, Miss Hunter,
we have Harlow:

400
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,574
We have Harlow for you.

401
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,409
May I have your attention?

402
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,380
You wanted
the greatest show on Earth:

403
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,215
out for revenge,

404
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,188

oh, shit:

- What are you doing here?
- I need information:

410
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,421
What have you heard?

411
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,152
I heard someone
came for you:

[tires screech]

Eddy:
I heard it got a bit messy:

414
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,200
And I heard about your wife:

415
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,397
Joshua:
What did you hear? Who told you?

416
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,271
The crazy American kid, Miles:

417
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,604
He's your one:

Miles Slade, the finger guy?

There's a good dog:
Yeah, that's a good dog:

That's a good dog:

Hey, what is this?

What is that, huh?

Yeah, hold on:
I'll just put you through:

00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,898
Just spoke to Lai Lai Zhen:

You tell her you wanted
to eat her pie?

- Excuse me, Senator:
- All right:

00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,564
It's Lai Lai:

458
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,737
Make sure that redneck
settles his marker

459
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,777
before he has another coronary:

460
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:49,807
Speak:

461
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,974
Lai Lai:
We have a situation with a civilian.

462
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,778
Macavoy:
Who are you talking to, the police?

463
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,251
Quiet:
I know you can see what's going on:

464
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,254
Host:
You know the rules, Lai Lai.

465
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,187
It's kill or be killed.

466
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,158
You're like a child
running back to Daddy

467
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,091
telling me how
the big boy stole your ball:

468
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,029
You're on the battlefield.
There is no going back.

469
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,363
And he's just one of those famous
innocent bystanders you hear about:

470
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,459
- Let me speak to him:
- no, stop it:

471
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,334
- This is Father Macavoy:
- I'll kill you myself:

472
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,101
- Let me speak to him:
- It's not right: He's just a priest:

473
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,110
Host:
Personally, I find it kind of apt.

474
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,942
Back in the day we used to throw
Christians to the lions.

475
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,847
Seems that history
is repeating itself.

476
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,111
Carry him or kill him,

477
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,676
but don't call back:

478
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,651
What's happened?
Are the police coming?

479
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,625

We have to get out of here now:

Woman:
Help me with the seatbelt:

491
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,592
- It's jammed:
- Don't let me die!

Come here: Come here:

Wrong day to be
a good Samaritan:

494

When I say "move it",
move it!

495
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,634
- Come on!
- What's going on?

496
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,009
You've got a bug inside you:
They think you're a hitter:

This is a competition for assassins:

00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,077
A game where people
kill each other?

500
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,211
Yes, we have to get
the tracker out of you,

501
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,256
otherwise you're a target:

502
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,416
Why don't we go to the police?

503
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,754
Eh? You and l:

504
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,623
You acted in self-defense:
I'll speak for you:

505
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,890
Is it my accent?
Do I stutter? Is that it?

506
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,454
The people who run this,

507
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,397
they are more powerful
than the police:

508
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,458
- Man: Somebody:::
- They will get you anywhere:

509
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,561
- :::do something!
- But the bodies:::

510
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,662
people will see the bodies:

511
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,331
There will be an explanation:

512
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,002
It won't be the truth,
but it will be what people will buy:

513
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,068
A madman with a gun,
a terrorist attack,

514
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,773
a natural disaster,
a car crash:

515
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,576
That's how the Tournament
remains a secret!

516
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,241
It's insane:

517
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,411
Don't you watch TV, Father?

518
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,454
The whole world is insane:

519
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,619
now move it!
Come on!

520
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:50,795
[cheering]

521
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,662
[cheering]

522
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,064
Tech: Sir.

523
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,431
Sir, can we just reconfirm?

524
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,231
You want to make
the priest a player?

525
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,771
You want him on the system?

526
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,932
Was I unclear, Mr: Hamilton?

527
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:08,104
no: no, sir:
It's ready: It's ready:

528
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,875
- This is bullshit:
- Shut up and do it:

529
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,251
Ladies and gentlemen,
a man of the cloth

530
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,723
has stepped out
from the sidelines:

531
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,625
If any of you good people
would like to take a long shot

532
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,356
on a man with a dog collar,

533
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,261
we'll take that action:

534
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,765
[laughter, applause]

535
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,301
[sirens]

536
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,176
Lai Lai:
Will you hurry up?

537
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,306
Macavoy:
It's not coming up:

538
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,647
How do you know
I've even swallowed this thing?

539
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,310
How else could it
be inside you?

540
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,945
[gagging]

541
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,520
Fuck! Fuck!

542
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,356
Everybody thinks I'm an assassin!

543
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,057
Everybody wants me dead!

544
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,998
- Yes:
- oh, fuck!

545
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,263
I don't wanna die:

546
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,132
- It's okay:
- I don't wanna die:

547
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,202
I don't wanna die:

548
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:17,213
- I don't know how to cope with this:
- You'll be okay:

549
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,909
[sirens approaching]

550
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,884
Trust me:

551
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,715
okay:

552
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,587
oh, thank God:
Thank God:

553
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,827
oh, officer,
thank goodness you're here:

554
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,293
- nice outfit, Father:
- [high-pitched whine]

555
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,631
Get down!

556
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,779
Come on!

557
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,011
What's happening?

558
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,575
I'm not sure,
but we have to get out of here now:

559
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,252
Macavoy:
A policeman's been killed:

560
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,848
- He's a player:
- A player?

561
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,224
Why would anybody want
to take part in this madness?

562
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,287
Cash prize, revenge,
title, excitement:

563
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,195
So what's your reason?

564
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,386
Macavoy:
I've seen him before:

565
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,447
- In the cafe this morning:
- Are you sure?

566
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,720
- Positive:
- He cut it out:

567
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,069
Hold on!

568
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,617
Fuck:

569
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,218
Miles:
Whoo! Here we go:

570
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,859
[chuckles]

571
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,128
Yeah: Hi, ladies!

572
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,473
[thunder rumbling]

573
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,047
[thunder clap]

574
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,340
Hurry back:

575
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,872
I love you, baby:

576
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,311
Enjoy your life together:

577
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,426
Where were you?

578
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:28,187
- [phone ringing]

Host on speaker:
Joshua,

580
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,695
I'm deeply sorry about your loss,

581
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,261
but I may have some information

582
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,830
about the person
that came after you.

583
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,001
I may know where
you can find them.

584
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:54,358
[thunder clap]

Rob:
oh, shit:

589
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,952
We got another one
of those cluster things:

590
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,044
Hamilton:
Jesus fucking Christ:

591
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,715
That's not a cluster:
That is a war zone:

592
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,849
Angel's titty bar?
Are you kidding me?

593
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,325
There's nine shooters in there:

594
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,656
Why aren't they
attacking each other?

595
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,162
Probably so many people
in the place

596
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,663
they don't know who is who:

597
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,825
All right, we got ourselves
a situation here:

598
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,664
We have nine players
in one location:

599
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,298
Repeat, nine players
in one shithole location:

600
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,069
Ladies and gentlemen,

601
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,010
we have a bloodbath
about to take place:

602
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,068
[crowd cheers]

603

Come on, bitches!

606
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,321
Yeah!

607
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,658
Fuck yeah!

608
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:45,926
Come on, boys!

609
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:46,970
Whoo-hoo!

610
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:52,742
Yeah!

611
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,210
no, you don't!

612
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,870
[Miles laughing]

613
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,848
I see you, bud!

[woman whimpering]

00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,123
Thanks, sweetheart:

617
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,359
They're going down fast:
Still taking bets:

Come on, boys!

619
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,468
Whoo-hoo!

620
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,951
Yeah!

00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:45,890
[laughing]

You fucking son of a bitch:

Whoo!

624
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,071
- Ho, ho, ho!
- This is fucked up:

oh!

626
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,743
That's Van de Ven out of the game:

Whoo!

636
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,677
Was it you, Miles?

637
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,150
Did you come after me?

638
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:51,449
- Stay still, honey:
- Did you murder my wife?

639
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,113
What the fuck you talking about?

640
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,055

Good night, sugar:

644
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,947
Dispatcher:
We're experiencing problems
with transmitting.

645
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,152
All units,
we have reports of gunfire...

Sorry, we're completely swamped here.

What the hell's going on today?

[radio chatter continues]

649
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,433
God, I need a drink:

650
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,569
You drink too much

651
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,305
and your eyes give you away:

652
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,574
You damage your liver:

653
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,082
That's just perfect:
That's just exactly what I need,

654
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,711
health advice from a hit man:

655
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,985
What are we going to do?

656
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,619
We have to wait until it passes
through your system:

657
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,993
The further out of town we go,
the less accurate the tracker:

658
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,623
It will buy us some time:

659
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,634
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

660
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,101
Why are you here?

661
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,331
Why are you playing?

662
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,499
Why all the questions?

663
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,600
Why do you drink so much?

664
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:24,306
Why were you sobbing
like a child this morning?

665
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,576
Because I'm lost:

666
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,188
You're lost?

667
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,690
Try to be me:

668
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,423
It must be tough playing God
with people's lives:

669
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,497
I don't play God:

670
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,761
If I don't do it,
somebody else will:

671
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:49,533
It's just a job:
nothing more:

672
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,698
I don't believe you:

673
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,704
otherwise,
why didn't you just kill me?

674
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,076
I don't kill the innocent:

675
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,748
I'm so happy:

676
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:10,484
Did you feel that?

677
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,061
Please!

678
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,257
Where were you?

679
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,539
[gasps]

680
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,770
Miles:
Can you hold that for me, buddy?

681
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,005
Huh: Howdy:

682
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,548
[Miles laughs]

683
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:37,854
Look at you:

684
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,421
Joshua Harlow,

685
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,221
greatest assassin there ever was:

686
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,152
Well, I shit ya,

687
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,858
you're well past your best, ain't ya?

688
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,697
But, hey, look at the bright side--

689
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,227
at least you fell at the hands
of this year's champion:

690
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,365
[Miles laughing]

691
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,107
Look at what I did to that guy:

692
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,944
What the fuck was I thinking?

693
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,780
Jesus, Miles,
you're a fucking maniac:

694
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,149
Thanks:

695
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,122
Have a drink, legend:

696
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,390
Trying to quit:

697
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:21,960
[groans]

698
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,125
Just to be clear, old-timer,

699
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,169
these are the last few
moments of your life

700
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,965
you're experiencing right now:

701
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,303
You might as well
have a drink with me:

702
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,205
Maybe later:

703
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,070
Suit yourself, superstar:

704
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,944
Go on, now, tell me:::

705
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,875
how many kills?

706
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,485
See, I love killing:

707
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,524
Just the smell of it:

708
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,386
Why Mary?

709
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:53,628
Mary?

710
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,062
Yeah:

711
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,998
Mary who?
I killed a fucking million Marys:

712
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,501
You know who:

713
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,662
Miami, four months ago:

714
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,864
I wasn't home:

715
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,407
It was me you wanted:
Why did you kill her?

716
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,909
[laughing]

717

[giggles]

719
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,817
Give me a second:

720
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,945
Hey, man, let me help you:

721
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:24,961
[grunts]

722
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,732
[thuds]

723
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,235
Whoa:

724
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,729
That's some nasty shit:

725
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:40,710
Now where were we?

726
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,134
My wife:

727
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,010
Yeah: Why weren't you there?

728
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,175
You left her all alone:

729
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,242
If I were you:::

730
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,648
I'd blame myself:

731
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,319
[chuckles]

732
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,721
Bad news, superstar:

733
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,595
This is really going to fuck you off:

734
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,770
It wasn't me:

735
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,607
Don't lie to me, kid:

736
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,779
I am not:::

737
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,745
- a kid!

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

740
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,558
I got me a $10 million trigger finger:

741
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,826
That's as close as you'll ever come,

742
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,027
you fucking amateur:

743
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,935
Here, let me help you with that:

- [sizzling]

I really wish it was me:

746
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,608
Shit, I really do:

747
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,204
But I wouldn't go take credit
for other people's work:

748
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,007
That'd just be wrong:

749
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,643
Don't you pass out on me, legend:

750
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,885
I'm going to tell you
who killed your wife:

751
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,160
It gives me great pleasure

752
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,721
to know:::

753
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,528
that you know who did it

754
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,832
and that you can't do
a fucking thing about it:

755
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,936
Lai Lai Zhen came after you:

Lai Lai Zhen:

00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:25,510
Heh:
She killed your wife:

759
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,408
You're a liar:

760
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,179
Am l?

761
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,824
I think I'll have that drink now:

762
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,519
That's the spirit:

763

Toast the new champion:

764
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,365

We say goodbye

772
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:07,575
I die a little

Every time we say goodbye

774
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:19,428
I wonder why a little

775
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:24,092
Why the gods above me

776
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:29,764
Who must be in the know

777
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:35,945
Think so little of me

778
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:41,450
They allow you to go?

779
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,453
When you're near

780
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:50,960
There's such an air

781

of spring about it

782
00:58:55,698 --> 00:59:02,797
I can hear a lark somewhere

There's no love song finer

all just a bad dream:

01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,779
He said what?

834
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,079
It's the right thing:

835
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:16,318

[whimpering]

837
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:21,154
What is it?

838
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,424
What is it?

839
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:24,591
[beeping faster]

840
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:25,725
No!

841
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,394
What is it?

842
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,370
Aah!

843
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,442
[telephone rings]

01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,779
[ringing continues]

845
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,621
[ringing]

846
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,302
Hello?
Mill's service station:

847
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,602
It's, um--

848
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,141
it's for you:

849
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,781
Hello?

850
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,511
Father Macavoy,

851
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:17,780
we haven't met,

852
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,789
but I feel I know you intimately:

853
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,792
So you're the sick fucker
that's running all this, are ya?

854
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,125
Such profanity
from a man of the cloth:

855
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,458
[crowd chuckles]

856
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,623
now I suggest you listen to me

857
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,328
very, very carefully:

858
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,461
Since you deemed it
necessary to interrupt

859
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,063
what could have been
a spectacular kill,

860
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,974
I feel I should clarify the rules a little.

861
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,808
There's a time limit
you really should take note of.

862
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,475
Time limit?
What are you talking about?

863
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,983
It's very simple.

864
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,316
You need to start killing
if you want to stay alive.

865
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,753
I'm not going to kill anyone:

866
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,814
We shall wait and see:

867
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,883
It will be your faith

868
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,428
against your desire to live:

869
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,987
That device inside you
is so much more than a tracker,

870
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,555
as you've just witnessed:

871
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,330
There's only four hours
left of the game, Father.

872
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,667
If there's more than
one player still alive

873
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,673
when the clock hits zero,

874
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,504
everyone will meet
the same fate

875
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,170
as your American friend.

876
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,373
So let's see if you have any real guts:

877
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,547
It's kill or be killed:

878
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,018
Four hours, Father,

879
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,749
and the clock is ticking:

880
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,290
[laughing]

881
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,223
[dial tone]

882
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,459
Thank you:

883
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,859
[laughs]

884
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:43,303
Well, that's perfect:

885
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:44,573
Hamilton: Let's bring a replay
of that up on one:

886
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,507
Hamilton: Let's bring a replay
of that up on one:

887
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:48,543
Rob: Jesus:

888
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,135
We have to do that to all of them

889
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,201
if the time runs out?

890
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,544
no, it takes them out automatically:

891
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,208
What's the priest doing?

892
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,378
If the sat imagery is correct,

893
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,617
he is trying to sort his shit out:

894
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,716
Lai Lai:
Anything yet?

895
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,557
Macavoy:
nothing's happening: I'm too tense:

896
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,223
It's got to come out
one end or the other:

897
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,424
[sighs]

898
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,558
Can you not wait outside?

899
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,071
I'm staying put:
now concentrate:

900
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,298
You're putting me off:

901
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,742
Can you whistle or something?

902
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,480
okay, who's Joshua's wife?

903
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,350
It doesn't matter:

904
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,389
okay:

905
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,322
I thought the way you reacted
when you heard--

906
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,622
Will you just leave it alone?

907
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,964
Bit of a confession
in here, really, eh?

908
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,106
Confession can be incredibly hard:

909
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,613
It's painful to admit our sins

910
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:02,014
and trust ourselves in God's care:

911
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,988
But it helps:

912
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,120
It helps:::

913
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,662
sometimes:

914
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,691
Why don't you tell me
why you're here?

915
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,327
Hmm?

916
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,166
What's it got to do
with Joshua's wife?

917
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,821
The last thing you see
in a target's eyes:::

918
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,016
is understanding:

919
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,928
Somewhere,
deep inside of them,

920
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,225
they've been expecting it:

921
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,927
Mary Harlow didn't have that look:

922
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,534
She just stared at me,

923
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,201
Iike you did this morning--

924
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,448
petrified, scared:::

925
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,352
bewildered:

926
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,660
I saw in her eyes

927
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,423
that something was wrong:

928
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,800
Please!

929
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,661
My instincts told me to stop:

930
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,197
Please!

931
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,139
But I pulled the trigger anyway:

932
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:41,715
[Lai Lai crying]

933
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,218
I didn't know it until afterwards,

934
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,449
but she was pregnant:

935
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,085
It's haunted me ever since:

936
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,525
That's why I have
to win this tournament:::

937
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,465
so I can get enough
money to vanish:

938
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,603
And if I don't win:::

939
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:13,604
then I get what's coming:

940
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,924
okay, Miss Hunter,
the final few players

941
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,429
seem to be converging
on the motorway:

942
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,828
We got Harlow on the move,

943
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,594
we're tracking Bogart nearby,

944
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,431
and the long shot, Topuzov,
is closing in fast:

945
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:38,200
Lai Lai Zhen and the priest
are sitting ducks:

[door opens]

947
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,711
We have to get out of here now:

948
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:54,813
- I haven't--
- Now:

949
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,414
okay:

950
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,562
Shit:

951
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,339
Quick, get to the car:

01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,142

Come on!

What's going on?

959
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,457
- I'm taking your bus:
- What?

960
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,126
I'm taking your bus:
