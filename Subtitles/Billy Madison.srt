1
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,672
~ Suntan lotion is good for me

2
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,549
~ You protect me

3
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,384
~ Tee-hee-hee

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,140
Oh, the sun tries to burn me,
but you won't let it, will ya?

5
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:03,146
Ultraviolet rays - bad. Lotion - good.

6
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,315
(blows raspberries )

7
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,528
Smiley.

8
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,915
There's something important
I was supposed to do today.

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,418
Have five daiquiris?

10
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,462
No, you remembered to do that.

11
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,259
Man, why did I have so many drinks?
I can't remember.

12
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,597
- What's today?
- October?

13
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,309
It's nudie-magazine day!

14
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,270
Yeah!

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,324
Watch out, butler!

16
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,492
Ooh, you're a quick one.

17
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,215
Nudie-magazine day!
Nudie-magazine day!

18
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,051
Nudie-magazine day! Nudie...

19
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,261
Agh! Ooh!

20
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,744
Ooh.

21
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,371
Eee...

22
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,501
Ah!

23
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,754
Oh!

24
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,552
(squawking )

25
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,432
Holy jeez!

26
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,646
Lookee what we got here.
That silly penguin is back again.

27
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,400
No, Mr Madison, there no penguin.
You got too much sun today.

28
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,361
- There no penguin!
- (squawks )

29
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:19,199
It's too damn hot for a penguin
to be just walkin' around here.

30
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,037
I gotta send him back to the South Pole.

31
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,833
No!

32
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:41,180
Penguin! Don't you dare run away!

33
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,184
Come here, Mr Penguin!

34
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,729
I'm one of the good guys, penguin.

35
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,857
Don't run! Oh. Oh...

36
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,204
Don't run!

37
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,165
Don't run from me!

38
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,375
Penguin!

39
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:15,881
Penguin.

40
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,599
You're a bad penguin.

41
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,726
Whee-hee!

42
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,728
Call the zoo!

43
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:38,195
All the people at the zoo
are very nice, penguin.

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,823
They'll treat you real respectable, like.

45
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:46,411
There's nothing to worry about, big fella.

46
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,207
Here I come!

47
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,261
Right this way, gentlemen.
Mr Madison is expecting you.

48
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,474
Leg.

49
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:15,274
Billy! You shouldn't pull that crap in front
of your father's business associates.

50
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,152
Now you get yourself upstairs
and get ready. Dinner's in 15 minutes.

51
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,613
- Yeah, yeah.
- Don't ''yeah, yeah'' me, boy.

52
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,908
This is a very important dinner.
You best be there.

53
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,161
I will. Thank you, Juanita.

54
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:32,374
You gotta dress yourself up
and look nice, too.

55
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,170
Oh, that boy's a fine
piece of work all right.

56
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,299
He's a fine piece of ass though, too.

57
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,975
Where the hell is he? I'm starvin'.

58
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,396
I ate some Triscuit crackers in the car.
You should've had some.

59
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,399
If you'd told me
there were Triscuit crackers,...

60
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,110
- ..I could've enjoyed them with you.
- I'm sorry.

61
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,906
Sorry doesn't put the Triscuit crackers
in my stomach, does it, Carl?

62
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,743
Gentlemen?
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

63
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,873
Have you all met?
Eric Gordon, my executive vice president.

64
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:17,711
And our operations manager Carl Alphonse.
Sit down, gentlemen, sit down.

65
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,838
Beautiful table.

66
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,007
Good seeing you, sir.

67
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,888
Where's Billy?

68
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,100
Juanita said he'd be down
in a few minutes.

69
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,062
I'm sure you'll all be very impressed.

70
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:39,900
Shampoo is better.
I go on first and clean the hair.

71
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,361
Conditioner is better.

72
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,864
I leave the hair silky and smooth.

73
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,450
Oh, really, fool? Really!

74
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,665
Stop looking at me, swan.

75
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,220
(slurps )

76
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,442
- Hey, Carl, what's up?
- Nothing much, Billy.

77
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,945
- I see you got a little sun today.
- You think so?

78
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:29,950
- I fell asleep by the pool for a few hours.
- Did you fall asleep or did you pass out?

79
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,204
Shut up!

80
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:38,834
That's enough, Billy. Because you took
your sweet-ass time coming down here,...

81
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,170
..these gentlemen will miss their flights.

82
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,174
Well, this guy can stay in my room,
I'll tell you that much.

83
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,349
Billy? Eat your soup.

84
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,768
It's good soup.

85
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,315
Gentlemen, I can't thank you enough
for coming this evening.

86
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,901
(yells gibberish )

87
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,404
Please, Billy, please,
no gibberish tonight, please. I beg you.

88
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,573
Sorry, Daddy.

89
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:14,536
This is a big night for me tonight, gents.
I have an important announcement.

90
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,955
(fast gibberish )

91
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,209
That's it, Billy! Get the hell outta here!

92
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,755
(slow gibberish )

93
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,975
- Nice talkin' to you, Billy.
- (singsong gibberish )

94
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,937
(yells )

95
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,448
Right. One, two, three!

96
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,995
Hey, Billy, how come
you ain't poundin' any tonight?

97
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,416
I don't know. My dad was yellin' at me.
I'm just not in the mood.

98
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:08,549
Hey, Billy, who would you rather bone,
Meg Ryan or Jack Nicholson?

99
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,511
Jack Nicholson now, or 197 4?

100
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,680
'7 4.

101
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,308
- Meg Ryan.
- Go.

102
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,311
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

103
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,733
Oh, my God! I am the winner!

104
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,487
- Billy is not an idiot.
- I'm not saying he's an idiot.

105
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:35,242
I just think he might not be mature
enough to run a Fortune 500 company.

106
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,162
My late wife Emily and I
started this company...

107
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,416
..with a 15-unit motel
in Patchogue, Long Island.

108
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,043
We built it into 650 hotels.

109
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,048
Our dream was to one day
turn it over to our only son Billy.

110
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,677
- How many people work for Madison?
- 61,000 and change.

111
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:59,600
How long will they have jobs once Billy
has the hotel operator speaking gibberish?

112
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,192
Oh, Billy, Billy boy.

113
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:12,070
When are you gonna find
whatever it is you're lookin' for?

114
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,656
Here's a nice piece of shit.

115
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,666
My, oh, my. Wait till old man Clemens
realises it's a bag of shit.

116
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,878
He's gonna shit when he realises it's shit.

117
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,589
Who got the lighter?

118
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,758
Come on.

119
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,268
Light it.

120
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,650
(rings doorbell)

121
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,696
Oh, my God! Old man Clemens hates shit!

122
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,448
Shh. Here he comes!

123
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,784
Who the hell is it? What do you want?

124
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:01,745
Judas Priest, Barbara!
One of those flaming bags again!

125
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,581
(Barbara ) Don't put it out
with your boots, Ted.

126
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,042
Don't tell me my business, devil woman.

127
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,921
Call the fire department.
This one's outta control(!)

128
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,094
(sniffs )

129
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,598
It's poop again!

130
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,184
He called the shit ''poop''!

131
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,021
This is the best night of my life!

132
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:33,026
I'll get you damn kids for this!
You're all gonna die!

133
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,657
Billy, could you step in here
for a moment?

134
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,076
I have big news.

135
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:45,164
Eric is pregnant! Congratulations, Dippy!

136
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,917
Feel those kicks!
He's gonna be a soccer player. He is.

137
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,670
He is.

138
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,801
All right, what's up?

139
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:00,470
I've had to face
some hard truths tonight, Billy.

140
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,182
Do we have to do this
with Captain Dipshit here?

141
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:07,269
You were brought up with
every advantage. I bought you everything.

142
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,272
Toys, cars, vacations, clothes...

143
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,858
Actually, I stole this shirt from Frank.

144
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:17,070
Yeah, well, whatever.
It's all my fault. I made a mistake.

145
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,991
Jeez, what...?
Are you some damned moron?

146
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,577
Can't you just stop for two seconds?

147
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:27,039
I'm trying to tell you that I'm retiring,
and Eric, not you,...

148
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,833
- ..is gonna take over Madison Hotels.
- Eric?!

149
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:34,254
You're gonna give the company to Eric?
He is a bad, bad man!

150
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,301
What do you care, Billy? What do you care
who I appoint to run the company, huh?

151
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,889
I mean, I'm doin' you a favour.
You don't ever have to look for a job.

152
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:49,102
You can sit around all day, goofing off,
sipping drinks, chasing invisible penguins.

153
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,898
Is that it, Dad?
Did the penguin tell you to do this?

154
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,150
- Penguin?
- What an idiot.

155
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,153
You know, I could help Billy
until he gets the hang of it.

156
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,950
I think crazy Carl is right. I mean,
I can do this if I set my mind to it.

157
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,536
High school was a pain in the ass,
but I graduated.

158
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,705
Because I paid your teachers
to give you decent grades.

159
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,875
I've regretted it every day since.
I thought at the time...

160
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,546
..if you could get good grades,
you might get into a good college...

161
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,715
- ..and straighten yourself out.
- I don't believe that.

162
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,177
Well, what do you believe?
That you were an honours student?

163
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:27,683
How could I hand over my company to someone who
couldn't even get through school on his own?

164
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,311
I don't know. Don't think about it.
Just hand it over.

165
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,399
Forget it.

166
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,988
Well, listen, don't you think you better
go to bed? Big day tomorrow.

167
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:45,868
A day filled with daiquiris
and Nintendos and jack-off magazines...

169
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,708
Yeah, what?

170
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,669
Give me one more chance.
I'll prove I can take over.

171
00:13:55,794 --> 00:14:00,382
I'll do anything it takes. I'll go back
to high school and take the exams again.

172
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:05,637
- I'll get my diploma all by myself.
- Billy, Billy, it wasn't just high school.

173
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,473
Remember that spelling bee
you won in the first grade?

174
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,518
- No, you didn't.
- Rock.

175
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,021
R-o-k.

176
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,899
Yeah? So what's your point?

177
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:20,444
- R-o-c-k!
- The C is silent.

178
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,906
OK, all right.

179
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:28,619
All right, you got it. First grade
through 12th grade all over again.

180
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:34,124
I'll do each grade in two weeks,
take the tests, regraduate,...

181
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:40,047
..prove to you I'm not an idiot, and then
I get to take over Madison Hotels.

182
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,216
That's some idea.

183
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,803
- You just think of that?
- Yeah, I did. It's pretty good, huh?

184
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,183
Brian, don't you think
the future of Madison Hotels...

185
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:56,021
..and its 61,000 employees is too
important to gamble on a game like this?

186
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,190
No.

187
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,361
You're on.
Carl, you make the arrangements.

188
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:08,784
You pass every grade before June 15
and you take over instead of Eric.

189
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:14,748
Have a nice weekend, son.
You start school on Monday.

190

Oh!

Give 'em hell, Bill.

The part of the story I don't like...

264
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,741
..is that the little boy gave up
looking for Happy after an hour.

265
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:45,704
He didn't put posters up. He just sat
on the porch like a goon and waited.

266
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:50,292
That little boy's gotta think:
you got a pet, you got a responsibility.

267
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,129
If your dog gets lost, you don't look
for an hour then call it quits.

00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:53,785
I ride the bus for the city
and watch the bus drivers.

311
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,872
This programme to make sure
they turn the wheels right...

312
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,249
Billy, you forgot your stuff.

313
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,965
Come on, honey.

314
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,551
Thank you very much, Miss Lippy!

315
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,557
- (phone rings )
- Yes.

316
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:20,020
- (secretary ) Brian Madison for you.
- Tell him I'm out to lunch.

317
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,272
Billy Madison.

318
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:28,237
A buffoon. And yet a threat
to my eventual takeover of this company.

319
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:31,740
A menace.
And what do we do with a menace?

320
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:36,286
We eliminate it.
We eliminate Billy Madison.

321
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,914
- Tricia Labonte?
- Here.

322
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,876
- Scotty Logan?
- Here.

323
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,964
- Billy Madison?
- (blows raspberry )

324
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,050
(laughing )

325
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:00,936
Hm...

326
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,505
Hey. Look at all this milk.

327
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,885
- You want some of this milk?
- That milk belongs to that classroom.

328
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,722
Oh. They don't gots to know about it.
It could be our milk.

329
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:39,725
No milk will ever be our milk.

330
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,644
Ooh. That wasn't very nice.

331
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,190
How 'bout you, sideburns?
You want some of this milk?

332
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:47,941
Rather have a beer.

333
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:24,394
I drew the duck blue because
I've never seen a blue duck before...

334
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,606
..and, to be honest with ya,
I wanted to see a blue duck.

335
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,984
Well, it's an excellent blue duck.

336
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:35,072
Congratulations.
You just passed the first grade.

337
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,950
Oh, Miss Lippy, that's so great.

338
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,202
What do you think of that, Mr Blue Duck?

339
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,788
That's quack-tastic!

340
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,627
Wow! Look at all that candy!

341
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,296
Rolex!

342
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:58,428
- Thanks for the watch, Billy.
- You're welcome, buddy.

343
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:04,393
This is great. When I graduated first grade
all my father did was tell me to get a job.

344
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:05,519
(braying )

345
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:09,523
Hey, you wanna feed that donkey
some beer, get it all messed up?

346
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:13,443
- Maybe later.
- I'll go put some beer in a bucket.

347
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:17,072
- OK.
- Hey there, Mr Graduate. How's it goin'?

348
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,241
(Eric ) Go!

349
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:25,247
Come on, kid! Get up! Get up!

350
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:27,958
You're humiliating yourself! Get up!

351
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:32,588
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

352
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,384
Aaah!

353
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:57,237
So he's passed first grade and
he's moved on to second. Whoop-de-do.

354
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,698
Any more information, Rollo?

355
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:06,246
Billy likes to drink soda.

356
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,669
Miss Lippy's car is green.

357
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,717
And now we have just two students left.

358
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,554
Bath.

359
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,057
Bath.

360
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:29,645
B-a-t-h.

361
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,980
- Bath.
- Correct!

362
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:36,360
Bath - that's a little easy.
Why don't you just give her the trophy?

363
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,154
Cheese.

364
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,199
Cheese.

365
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:49,456
C-h-e-e-s-e.

366
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,875
- Cheese.
- Correct.

367
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,630
- Couch.
- Couch.

368
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,175
C...

369
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,554
C-o...

370
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,974
- W?
- No!

371
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,185
No, I'm sorry, that's not right.

372
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,979
(laughs )

373
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:16,066
Well, Billy, if you spell this correctly,
you pass second grade.

374
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:19,778
Couch.

375
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,947
C...

376
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:24,324
Cou...

377
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,326
Cou...

378
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:29,454
C-o...

379
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,668
R... Are you going to the mall later?
That's what I'm asking.

380
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:38,380
No, I am not going to the mall.
Keep spelling, mister.

381
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,425
C-o-u...

382
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,345
..c-h?

383
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,473
Correct!

384
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,685
I am the smartest man alive!

385
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,647
(squealing )

386
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:01,278
Is he gonna have a stupid party
every time he passes a grade?

387
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,364
(Carl) Everybody's having
a good time but you.

388
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,950
Spoilt snot. Get outta here.

389
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:12,956
Let me ask you something, Carl.
You started here, what, 25 years ago?

390
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,667
Night bellboy at the Philadelphia Madison?

391
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:21,381
After all your hard work, how would you
feel working for some punk kid like Billy?

392
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:23,884
Could be worse.

393
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,555
That's nice.

394
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:34,228
Man, I'm so nervous.
First and second grade were easy,...

395
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:38,398
..but social studies, division?
This is gonna be tough.

396
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,195
Man, I'm so nervous.
First and second grade were easy,...

397
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,198
..but social studies, division?
This is gonna be tough.

398
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,534
Relax, dude.

399
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,119
Jackpot.

400
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:55,624
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning, Miss Vaughn.

401
00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:00,921
We're gonna start today by reading
a short story entitled ''My Sister Fanny''.

402
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,006
Quiet.

403
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:07,386
OK, so let's all open up
our Reading is Fun books to page 69.

404
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:09,555
69!

405
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:15,102
Class, say hello to Billy Madison.

406
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:18,564
Hello, Billy Madison.

407
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:21,608
Billy is a nuisance.
He will be gone in two weeks.

408
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,820
I apologise for this inconvenience.

409
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,866
- Jeez! What's up her butt?
- What was that, Billy?

410
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:32,077
I said ''Reading is good.''

411
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,663
Can we start the story now?

412
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,084
Dan, you may begin.

413
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,628
''O... o... once...

414
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,631
..th... th... there w... was...

415
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:47,301
..a g... g... girl...

416
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,511
..who w...''

417
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,847
- He can't even read.
- Cut it out, dude.

418
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,433
You're gonna get us in trouble.

419
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,853
''..p... p... p... p...''

420
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,063
T... t... t... today, junior!

421
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,285
Ow! You're tearing my ear off!

422
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:18,248
Making fun of a kid for trying to read.
Are you psycho? Do you not have a soul?

423
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:21,919
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
I've been physically abused in the ear.

424
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:27,007
Keep your mouth shut for the next two
weeks or I'm gonna fail you. End of story.

425
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:31,887
I see your lips movin', but I can't
make out your words. I'm deaf.

426
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:36,892
Oh, Veronica Vaughn. So hot.

427
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,228
Want to touch the heinie.

428
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,230
(howls )

429
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:45,150
So that girlie I've been chasin'?
Turns out she's my third-grade teacher.

430
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,820
First thing she does
is kick me out of her class.

431
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:50,864
Maybe she feels she has
to make an example of you.

432
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:54,076
- Or she's got somethin' up her ass.
- That's what I said.

433
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,703
- Poor Billy.
- I'm so depressed.

434
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,165
- Want me to take my shirt off for you?
- No, thank you.

435
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,961
OK, baby. But remember,
the offer is on the table.

436
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:09,633
Oh, yes. Oh, my.

437
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,844
Oh, God, yes.

438
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:14,221
- Lordy.
- Billy Madison.

439
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,472
Uh-huh?

440
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:19,852
Would you like to try writing some words
in cursive on the blackboard today?

441
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:22,020
OK. Sure.

442
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:30,988
OK, how about the word ''dugout''?

443
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,876
OK, good. How about ''bunt''?

444
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:56,305
Bunt. B-u-n-t.

445
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,893
In perfect cursive.
Any more brain-busters?

446
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,313
Rizzuto.

447
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:13,113
Z... Z...

448
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:23,749
Rirruto?

449
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,127
Those are Zs.

450
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,171
They look like Rs to me.

451
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:34,635
That's not fair! Rizzuto is not a word.
He's a baseball player. You're cheating.

452
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,137
Would you like to try the word ''buzz''?

453
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,264
(children laugh )

454
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:42,226
I hate cursive and I hate all of you!

455
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:44,853
I'm never comin' back to school! Never!

456
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,272
(children laugh )

457
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,445
(Juanita ) Billy!

458
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:04,206
I swear, I'm sick. I can't go to school.

459
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:08,836
If you're gonna stay home today,
you could help me shave my armpits.

460
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:11,880
Oh, my God! I'll go to school.

461
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,678
O'Doyle rules!

462
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:29,439
- What's goin' on?
- Miss Vaughn's sick.

463
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,818
(teacher claps )

464
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,612
Please take your seats.

465
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:40,450
- Who's that guy?
- Principal Anderson.

466
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:48,709
As you can tell, Miss Vaughn is not feeling
well today, so I'll be taking her place.

467
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:52,004
But don't get your hopes up,
because I plan on teaching,...

468
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:54,715
..so I hope you plan on learning.

469
00:36:55,382 --> 00:37:00,304
Now, who can tell me where we are
in our social-studies reader?

470
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,431
Yes?

471
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:04,141
Michael?

472
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,311
Excuse me. What's that in your hand?

473
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,940
Bring that note up to me.

474
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,401
(class ) Ooh.

475
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:21,950
Now let's see what couldn't wait
till after class.

476
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:31,752
''We're so lucky to have
Principal Anderson substituting.''

477
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:38,175
''Now we have the privilege of staring
at that tub of lard all day long''?

478
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:44,431
''If I were him, I would walk my fat ass
right into oncoming traffic.''

479
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:51,480
Oh, man, Billy,
I just thought of the funniest thing.

480
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:54,274
Billy?

481
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:59,613
- Where's Billy?
- He's in school, man.

482
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:00,989
Oh, yeah.

483
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,305
(~ 'I'm Not the One' by the Cars )

484
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,516
~ I'm not the one

485
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:31,270
~ That you'll be shootin' for

486
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:33,438
~ I'm not the one

487
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,984
~ Who's coming back for more

488
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,529
~ You know why

489
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:42,990
~ We've been through this too many times

490
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:45,993
~ You know why

491
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:49,580
~ It's never clear it's pantomime

492
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:56,712
I don't wanna sound like a weirdo,
but I kinda missed Miss Vaughn today.

493
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,756
- Why? Do you like her or something?
- No!

494
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:02,926
- Why? Did she say she likes me?
- Not to me.

495
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,721
Well, let's find out.

496
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:20,277
Uh, hello?

497
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,529
Um, is this Miss Vaughn?

498
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,573
Oh, hi. It's Ernie from class.

499
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:27,618
(whispers ) Ask her if she has a boyfriend.

500
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:31,246
Uh, Miss Vaughn, do you have a boyfriend?

501
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:35,125
(whispers ) No.

502
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,419
- Ask her...
- Shh!

503
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:41,757
Ask her if she likes anybody from class,
like, more than a friend.

504
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:47,262
Uh, Miss Vaughn, do you like
anybody in class more than a friend?

505
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,061
(whispers ) No.

506
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:58,273
Ask her if she would ever
go out with somebody from class.

507
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,359
- No!
- Just do it!

508
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:06,490
Um, Miss Vaughn, would you ever
go out with anybody from class?

509
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,243
Uh-huh.

510
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,162
Uh-huh.

511
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:15,624
You see, Ernie, grown-ups like
to go out with other grown-ups.

512
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:19,044
- What about Billy?
- You're more of a grown-up than Billy.

513
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:21,713
- I'll give you a grown-up.
- What was that, Ernie?

514
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,093
(high-pitched) Nothing.
See you tomorrow in class, Miss Vaughn.

515
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,262
You blew it!

516
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:38,564
Hey, I dare you to throw
your sandwich at the bus driver.

517
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:42,025
(children ) Do it. Come on.

518
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:45,904
Hey!

519
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:48,490
Hey, who threw that?

520
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:52,995
I'll turn this damn bus around.

521
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,916
That'll end your precious little
field trip pretty damn quick, huh?

522
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,211
Bullshit.

523
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:12,181
Hey, I'm tryin' to score points with
the teacher today. Don't screw it up!

524
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:15,434
I dare you to touch her boobs.

525
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:18,645
Touch her boobs? That's assault, brother.

526
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,027
Ya double-dare me?

527
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:34,495
Miss Vaughn, how long till we get there?

528
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,373
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Probably about two minutes.

529
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:42,669
Sorry about that.
Damn guy drives like an animal.

530
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,049
That's all right, Billy.
Why don't you go back and sit down now?

531
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,384
- OK.
- I double-dare you.

532
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,095
Da... I... Accident...

533
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,348
Mistake... Tit...

534
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,934
- Go sit down now.
- Yes.

535
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:59,102
(children giggle )

536
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:07,778
Yeah, here we go again.
Another treat from the road.

537
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:11,698
Grand, ripe banana.
Trick of the day. Great...

538
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:19,540
(woman ) What is a horseshoe?
What does a horseshoe do?

539
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:21,875
Are there any horse socks?

540
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,044
Is anybody listening to me?

541
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:27,047
Anyways, I am sorry about
what happened back there,...

542
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:30,467
..but you have to admit,
I've been tryin' to be good lately.

543
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,929
Well, you're not the first person
that's tried to grab my chest.

544
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:37,766
I'm trying not to hold you to a higher
standard than the rest of the students.

545
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:40,644
Although maybe I should.
You are, what, 50?

546
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:45,774
No, but the other kids look up to me.
I don't want them to think I'm a coward.

547
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:50,737
Don't worry about it. Next week you're
gonna have another teacher to annoy.

548
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:55,534
I don't want to annoy another teacher,
Miss Vaughn. I want to annoy you.

549
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:59,621
- Miss Vaughn!
- Somebody stole all our lunches.

550
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:02,708
Who would steal 30 bagged lunches?

551
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:13,051
I'll tell you who took those lunches.

552
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:15,429
That damn sasquatch.

553
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:20,726
Well, I guess that's it.
OK, everybody! Back on the bus!

554
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:24,771
- Hey, what's with Ernie?
- I don't know. I'll be right back.

555
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:29,318
Hey, Ernie, what's up?

556
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:32,446
Nothing.

557
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:37,075
You fallen in love
with the wall or somethin'?

558
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:40,287
- I had an accident.
- An accident. What does that mean?

559
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:41,705
Ooh!

560
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:44,333
Oh, I know. OK. Uh...

561
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,590
Don't worry, buddy. You hang tight.
I'll be right back.

562
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:02,267
Hey, look, everybody! Billy peed his pants!

563
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:07,231
Of course I peed my pants. Everybody
my age pees their pants. It's the coolest.

564
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:09,149
- Really?
- Yes!

565
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:13,111
You ain't cool unless you pee your pants.

566
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:16,657
- Wow.
- Hey, man, Ernie peed his pants too.

567
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,785
All right!

568
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:28,252
If peeing your pants is cool,
consider me Miles Davis.

569
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:29,628
Oh!

570
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:34,508
That was the grossest thing
I've ever heard in my life! Let's go!

571
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:36,927
Get on the bus here.

572
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:39,179
Move it. Get up there, Kyle.

573
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,431
One, two, five, seven.

574
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:45,143
Move it or lose it. Get on the b...

575
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:47,729
Hi, Miss Vaughn. Nice to see ya.

576
00:44:55,529 --> 00:45:00,909
That Veronica Vaughn is one piece of ass.

577
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:06,373
I know from experience, dude,
if you know what I mean.

578
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:08,458
No, you don't.

579
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:13,297
Well, not me personally, but a guy I know.
Him and her got it on.

580
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:15,465
Whoo-ee!

581
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:18,343
No, they didn't.

582
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,929
No, no, no, they didn't.

583
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:24,975
But you can imagine
what it'd be like if they did, right? Huh?

584
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:35,360
Everybody on?
Good, great, grand, wonderful!

585
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:39,448
No yelling on the bus!

586
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:43,410
~ Billy passed the third grade

587
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:47,539
~ Oh, what a glorious day

588
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:51,335
~ Oh, passin' third grade

589
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:55,422
~ The Billy Madison way

590
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:57,341
Yeah!

591
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:59,676
Rock on! Yes!

592
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,481
(boy ) Stop it.

593
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:18,153
Who are you? I don't even know you.
Go away, mister. Stop it.

594
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,322
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

595
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:27,704
- Look! She came!
- And she came too.

596
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:47,558
The mucus queen is yours.

597
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:50,185
Thanks.

598
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,354
Hi!

599
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:56,859
Oh, gosh. Oh, thank you.

600
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:02,781
Oh, my God!

601
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:06,326
Snack Pack! You're the coolest!

602
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:10,330
- Those should last you the weekend.
- Thank you very much.

603
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:13,458
- Billy is on the right track.
- He's on track all right.

604
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:16,253
He's headed right down the toilet.

605
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:20,007
Easy.

606
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:23,594
You still don't think he's gonna make it?

607
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,056
Trust me, Carl, baby.
I know he's not gonna make it.

608
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:30,642
Would you excuse me for a second?

609
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:36,148
Who will help me destroy Billy Madison?

610
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:38,317
Who?

611
00:47:56,126 --> 00:48:00,047
You know, that was really sweet,
the way you helped Ernie out yesterday.

612
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:03,300
He would have done the same for me.

613
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:06,386
So what's it like being back in school?

614
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:09,056
I don't know. I kinda feel
like an idiot sometimes.

615
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:12,309
Although I am an idiot,
so it kinda works out.

616
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:16,772
Is it just you and your dad in here?

617
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:21,693
Well, actually, no. There's Juanita,
and some maids and butlers and stuff.

618
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:24,947
And people who work for my dad
are always stoppin' by.

619
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:29,493
And my friends are always sleepin' over,
even when I didn't ask 'em to.

620
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:32,704
- Sounds like a hotel.
- It kinda is. It can be distracting.

621
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:35,332
That's why I moved out here.

622
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:49,137
Wow.

623
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:52,266
This is where I've been spending
most of my time lately.

624
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:54,893
Not exactly roughing it, are you?

625
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:03,777
Those are, uh...
They come with the tent, so...

626
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:13,495
Oh, wow. A Tale of Two Cities.
I don't think we're up to that one yet.

627
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,124
I can understand nine words
in that book now.

628
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:24,256
So, it's, um... the last day of third grade.

629
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:29,219
And you have the teacher,
alone, in your tent.

630
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:32,598
What do you wanna do?

631
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:37,811
Well, I can think of three things
I'd like to do.

632
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:42,232
One would involve some ice cubes
and a nine-iron.

633
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,820
- Two would include a buffalo.
- Really?

634
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:52,326
Live or stuffed.
Preferably stuffed, for safety's sake.

635
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:55,454
Three: we'd bring back
some of those ice cubes,...

636
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:58,707
..but switch it over to a pitching wedge.

637
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,960
How you guys doin'?

638
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,090
Hey! Carl! Good to see you!

639
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:12,471
This is Veronica, my teacher. That's Carl.

640
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:16,391
Very pleased to meet you.
Bill, I think Eric is up to something.

641
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:19,311
- Who's Eric?
- He works for my dad too.

642
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:22,356
He gets the company if I screw up.
He's a douchebag.

643
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:26,985
He made some menacing comments to me,
and then he did that little weasel laugh.

644
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:31,281
- Yeah. How does that laugh go again?
- You know. (laughs )

645
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:34,868
- Very good. It sounded just like him.
- Thanks.

646
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:37,996
Well, I'm sure he's got
something up his sleeve.

647
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,748
- Thanks, buddy.
- No problem.

648
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:42,376
(~ 'ABC' by the Jackson 5)

649
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:46,755
~ You went to school to learn, girl

650
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,800
~ Things you never, never knew before...

651
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:54,847
(teacher ) The most densely populated part
of the US is along the eastern seaboard.

652
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:59,142
We're gonna talk about why that is
over the next few minutes.

653
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:03,522
We all know what a census is, don't we?
That's like taking a census...

654
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:09,987
You know, yeah. Pick it up and gimme...

655
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:12,072
You want some of this?

656
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,700
Oh, my dear Lord!

657
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:18,412
You never leave me open, son,
cos I'm gonna hit it every time.

658
00:51:18,537 --> 00:51:21,290
You want some more of that?
I didn't think so!

659
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:26,461
~ Reading, writing, arithmetic
are the branches of the learning tree

660
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:29,882
~ But without the roots
of love every day, girl

661
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:32,384
~ Your education ain't complete

662
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:34,887
~ Teacher's gonna show you

663
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:37,014
~ How to get an A

664
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:40,142
~ How to spell 'me', 'you'
and add the two

665
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:42,603
~ Listen to me, baby,
that's all you gotta do

666
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,229
~ ABC

667
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:46,773
~ It's easy as 1-2-3

668
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:50,444
~ As simple as do-re-mi, ABC...

669
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,392
(belches the alphabet )

670
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,982
All right, stop before I throw up.

671
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:32,486
Hey, Billy, you wanna go
play soccer with us after school?

672
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:35,864
No, I got a test on Friday.
I'll play with you guys next week.

673
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:39,076
- Next week you'll be in ninth grade.
- Yeah, high school.

674
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,327
Oh, yeah.

675
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:45,207
You aren't gonna wanna hang round with
a bunch of dumb elementary-school kids.

676
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:48,961
That's not true. I'll come
and visit you guys all the time.

677
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:51,255
Yeah, to see your girlfriend.

678
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:53,298
(boys ) Whooo!

679
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:56,552
(cackling )

680
00:52:56,718 --> 00:53:00,389
Have some more Sloppy Joes.

681
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:05,018
I made 'em extra sloppy for yous.

682
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:11,483
I know how yous kids like 'em sloppy.

683
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:15,028
Lady, you're scarin' us.

684
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:46,059
- Do you know where the bathroom is?
- Second door on the left.

685
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:53,400
Hey, tubby, how about
a little bathroom reading?

686
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:57,196
I have the August 1983 issue
of Wrestling World here.

687
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:02,659
There's a terrific article about
a wrestler named the Revolting Blob.

688
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:08,540
Gee, you know somethin'?
He kinda looks like someone I know.

689
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,669
- Where'd you get that?
- I have a subscription.

690
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:18,425
Bad guy. He threw one opponent out of
the ring and hit a bunch of senior citizens.

691
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:22,971
Boy, this wacko looks familiar.

692
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:26,767
What do I care about some
stupid phoney wrestling guy?

693
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:28,894
My God.

694
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:33,816
In June 1983 he sat on
some guy's head and killed him.

695
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:36,109
It was just a stunt!

696
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:39,655
He was supposed to pinch my leg
if he was running short of air.

697
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:44,451
With this guy sitting on everyone's head,
I wonder how he got his teaching degree?

698
00:54:44,618 --> 00:54:46,328
No!

699
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:50,499
No, you can't do that to me.
Those kids are my whole life!

700
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:55,504
So you wouldn't want anything to happen
that would make 'em think less of you?

701
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:57,297
Max?

702
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:00,092
Max?

703
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:02,427
You ready to cooperate with me?

704
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:04,471
Yes.

705
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,307
Then Madison Hotels is as good as mine!

706
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:21,697
(rock music from car )

707
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,138
(laughter )

708
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,100
- (student ) Nice shirt.
- Yeah. Yep.

709
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:52,269
(bell rings )

710
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:03,489
Now the cell's happy. But other molecules
are saying ''We'd like some energy too.''

711
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:09,620
And it uses its own pigment molecule,
chlorophyll, to carry out the action.

712
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:13,081
This does not make the ribosomes happy.

713
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:17,252
And poor chlorophyll is caught
in the middle of this.

714
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:21,006
Chlorophyll? More like ''bore-ophyll''!

715
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,468
Right?

716
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:31,517
- Jeez, a little bit stuffy in here, huh?
- Don't talk to me.

717
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:34,353
- And why is that?
- Because you're a loser.

718
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,649
(teacher ) ..from these ribosomes.
And chlorophyll helps the chloroplast...

719
00:56:38,774 --> 00:56:41,068
No, I will not make out with you!

720
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,781
Did you hear that? This girl wants to
make out with me in the middle of class!

721
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:49,034
You got ''chlorophyll man'' up there
talkin' about God knows what.

722
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:54,248
All she's talking about is makin' out with
me. I'm here to learn, not to make out.

723
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:56,625
Go on with the chlorophyll.

724
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:03,131
O'Doyle rules.

725
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:06,718
Thanks a lot, O'Doyle. Nice meetin' you.

726
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:09,763
(giggling )

727
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:14,142
- Wait till they start with the wedgies.
- Yeah.

728
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:18,522
You oughta start cutting your underwear
before you get to school. So it rips easier.

729
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:20,691
I see. Who are you guys?

730
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:23,777
The guys everybody used to pick on
before you started here.

731
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:28,782
No, they ain't pickin' on me. They're givin'
me a hard time cos I'm the new guy.

732
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:30,868
A little first-day hazing.

733
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:35,664
- Are you in loser denial or something?
- I had a bad case of loser denial myself.

734
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:38,792
Till the lacrosse team stuck
a parking cone up my ass.

735
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:43,338
Loser? I ain't no loser.
I was the king of this high school.

736
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:46,758
A hundred friends, a million parties...

737
00:57:46,925 --> 00:57:49,219
You guys are losers, not me.

738
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:54,266
And that is what a prime number is.

739
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:56,602
(children ) Billy!

740
00:57:56,768 --> 00:58:00,063
I figured I got fourth period off,
I'd shoot down and say hi.

741
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:03,066
- How's high school, Billy?
- Yeah, how's high school?

742
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:07,196
High school is great.
I mean, I'm learning a lot.

743
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:11,867
And all the kids are treating me
very nice. It's great.

744
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:15,037
Gee, I can't wait till I go to high school.

745
00:58:16,497 --> 00:58:18,749
Don't you say that.

746
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:21,627
Don't you ever say that.

747
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:23,879
Stay here.

748
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:26,965
Stay as long as you can.

749
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,469
For the love of God, cherish it.

750
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:33,096
(Veronica ) Jennifer,
why don't you read out loud?

751
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:35,974
You gotta cherish it.

752
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:38,185
You do.

753
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,937
Hm.

754
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:45,984
I don't understand it.

755
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:50,364
I mean, ten years ago high school
was the greatest. I had so much fun.

756
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:53,492
I guess a little too much fun,
since you've gotta do it again.

757
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:59,331
I know. It's just that classes are so hard,
and all the kids treat me like I'm a goof.

758
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:02,417
Well, you are a goof.

759
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:06,004
Suck it up. Eight more weeks
and you're all set.

760
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,799
Yeah, you're right. You're so smart.

761
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:13,887
- I gotta go, OK?
- OK.

762
00:59:14,805 --> 00:59:16,431
Billy, wait.

763
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:20,269
It doesn't feel so great
to be called a loser, does it?

764
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:21,478
No.

765
00:59:21,603 --> 00:59:24,148
Maybe the first time
you went to high school,...

766
00:59:24,273 --> 00:59:28,902
..you weren't as nice to the kids
that you thought were losers.

767
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:32,322
I know what you're sayin'.
You're so smart.

768
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:44,376
(phone rings )

769
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:48,255
Hello?

770
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:51,633
- Hi. Is this Danny McGrath?
- Yeah.

771
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:55,262
The Danny McGrath that graduated
from Knibb High School in 1984?

772
00:59:55,971 --> 01:00:00,267
- Uh, yeah. Who's this?

You probably don't remember me,
but I went to high school with you.

774
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,232
I kinda gave you a hard time back then,...

775
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:11,069
..and I did some things that
I thought were funny at the time,...

776
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:14,573
..but now I realise they
were just mean and stupid.

777
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:18,327
And I just wanted to apologise,
and I hope you forgive me.

778

Yeah, sure. Don't worry about it.

Wow! That's great!

780

Well, I am sorry, and maybe
we can get together some time...

781
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,963
..and have coffee or somethin'.

782
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:33,884

Billy Madison was enrolled there.

During that time
Mr Madison was disruptive.

794
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:55,382
The only reason he passed was that
he offered me a bribe of $5,000,...

- You seriously don't believe me?

in my home without parental supervision.

surprise me like this at my home, but I...

that you said didn't happen.

Oh, well, listen, kids.

anything about this Max guy?

911

No, sir. He's vanished.

Things were going along great until
this wrestling freak messed things up.

915
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:30,397
Billy should get
another shot at high school.

916
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:35,903
Hey, rules are rules. Billy was supposed to
finish each grade within the two weeks...

917
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:38,822
..or I get the company.
He didn't finish ninth grade.

918
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:41,950
Eric, certainly there are
extenuating circumstances.

919
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:46,246
Extenuating, exschmenuating.
We had a deal. A signed, written deal.

920
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:48,790
Each grade, two weeks,
or I get the company.

921
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:51,710
Well, technically you're right, but...

922
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:55,172
Oh, shut up, Brian. I've had
to listen to your jawing for too long.

''Well, technically...''

01:10:57,591 --> 01:11:02,346
Just shut up! Are you ready
to hand the company over to me now?

925
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:05,849
- No.
- Then I'll see your ass in court.

Good.

927
01:11:08,602 --> 01:11:11,146
Nice talkin' to ya, shitheads.

928
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:14,900
Hey, Eric, how would you like
to settle this now, no lawyers?

929
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:17,277
You and me, mano y mano.

930
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:20,280
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?

931
01:11:20,405 --> 01:11:23,325
- Carl, what does that mean?
- Uh... I don't know.

932
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:30,207
It means an academic decathlon.

933
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:34,253
One day, ten events, testing all the
knowledge one would gain in high school.

934
01:11:34,378 --> 01:11:36,839
Me versus you.

935
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:41,051
- You're joking, right?
- Let's take it a little easy here, Billy.

936
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:45,139
No, I'm serious. Let's do it.
Let's do it on Friday.

937
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:48,517
- Let's do it.
- Is that all right with you, Daddy?

938
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:50,894
Well, if you think you can beat him.

939
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:54,815
Oh, I can. And I will.

940
01:11:55,524 --> 01:11:58,610
- It's a deal.
- (whispers ) I know it was you.

941
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:03,532
You broke my heart.

942
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:08,620
Here are the trigonometry hand-outs.

943
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:11,331
Last year's physics notes.
Best I could do.

944
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:14,793
Thanks a lot, fellas. You're saving my life.

945
01:12:19,214 --> 01:12:20,757
O'Doyle rules.

946
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:24,761
O'Doyle, I got a feeling
your whole family's goin' down.

947
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,139
But for now I gotta study.

948
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:32,728
(Veronica ) Norman invasion of England.

949
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:35,063
1066.

950
01:12:36,648 --> 01:12:38,692
That is correct.

951
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:43,572
The Magna Carta.

952
01:12:46,074 --> 01:12:49,411
1215?

953
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:53,332
Yes.

954
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:58,462
Spanish Armada.

955
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:05,844
1466?

956
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:09,223
'67? 1469?

957
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:11,558
1514?

958
01:13:11,683 --> 01:13:14,937
1981? 1986?

959
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:20,442
Please do not do that. Come on, I swear...
Just hang in there one second.

960
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:23,362
Please, God, give me the answer!

961
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:28,492
Buenos dias.

962
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:30,953
Buenas tardes.

963
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:32,621
Buenas noches.

964
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:35,499
(speaks French very quickly )

965
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:42,422
Slow down.

966
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:45,217
(speaks French very quickly )

967
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:50,681
Oh(!)

968
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:57,521
Spanish Armada...

969
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,274
1588.

970
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:02,442
That is correct.

971
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:17,332
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to
a generous donation by Mr Madison...

972
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:21,962
..to the Knibb High School library, I have
been able to arrange for ten teachers...

973
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:26,258
..to administer this academic decathlon
in various courses of study.

974
01:14:26,383 --> 01:14:30,387
However, if there is any attempt
by either contestant to cheat,...

975
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:37,269
..especially with my wife, who is a dirty,
dirty tramp, I am just gonna snap.

976
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:40,397
Do I make myself clear?

977
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:41,732
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

978
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:45,569
All right, then.
Let the academic decathlon begin.

979
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:15,474
(Billy laughs )

980
01:15:34,952 --> 01:15:37,913
Second team, all-American, Harvard track.

981
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:41,124
Is that right?

982
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:46,839
Oh, gross! Did you see that guy's balls?

983
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:49,424
Yeah, they were weird-lookin'.

984
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:56,557
Whoa!

985
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:12,781
(tuneful melody )

986
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,884
(squeaking )

987
01:16:34,428 --> 01:16:35,888
He's good.

988
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:39,433
To be, or not to be:

989
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:42,811
that is the question:

990
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:46,356
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

991
01:16:46,482 --> 01:16:50,611
The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

992
01:16:50,736 --> 01:16:56,325
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

993
01:16:56,450 --> 01:17:00,370
And by opposing end them?

994
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:05,209
To die: to sleep;

995
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:07,377
No more.

996
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,880
(boy ) Billy!

997
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,342
Hey, hey, hey. Who rules?

998
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:15,260
O'Doyle rules!

999
01:17:15,886 --> 01:17:16,887
O'Doyle rules!

1000
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:18,514
O'Doyle rules!

1001
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:20,224
O'Doyle rules!

1002
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:22,059
O'Doyle rules!

1003
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:23,268
O'Doyle rules!

1004
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:25,020
O'Doyle rules!

1005
01:17:25,687 --> 01:17:27,314
O'Doyle rules!

1006
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:29,483
(explosion )

1007
01:17:42,246 --> 01:17:43,997
Good afternoon, students.

1008
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:47,793
You've been invited here today
to witness the tenth and final event...

1009
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:53,340
..in the competition between
Mr Eric Gordon and Mr Billy Madison.

1010
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:03,851
As of this moment, Mr Madison
is ahead by one point.

1011
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:09,648
Each competitor will select
the final category for his opponent.

1012
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:14,278
Mr Madison will go first.
Mr Gordon, choose the topic.

1013
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:17,698
English Literature.

1014
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:20,159
US Presidents.

1015
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:22,744
My Wife, the Tramp.

1016
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:26,582
Burning Dog Poo
and the Human Response.

1017
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:29,334
Reflections of Society in Literature.

1018
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:32,796
Reflections of Society in Literature.

1019
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:35,757
Good luck, schmuck.

1020
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:39,178
Mr Madison.

1021
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:43,432
The Industrial Revolution changed
the face of the modern novel for ever.

1022
01:18:43,557 --> 01:18:47,060
Discuss, citing specific examples.

1023
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,815
(yelling )

1024
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,984
(clears throat )

1025
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:57,863
Uh...

1026
01:18:57,988 --> 01:18:58,989
Come on!

1027
01:19:05,037 --> 01:19:06,914
OK.

1028
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:10,417
The Industrial Revolution, to me,
is just like a story I know...

1029
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:13,837
..called The Puppy Who Lost His Way.

1030
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:18,509
The world was changing...

1031
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:22,971
..and the puppy was getting... bigger.

1032
01:19:23,597 --> 01:19:28,477
So, you see, the puppy was like industry,...

1033
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:32,940
..in that they were both
lost in the woods,...

1034
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:40,531
..and nobody, especially the little boy -
society - knew where to find them.

1035
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:47,454
Except that the puppy... was a dog.

1036
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:51,834
But the industry, my friends,...

1037
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:54,419
..that was a revolution.

1038
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,300
Knibb High football rules!

1039
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:17,067
Mr Madison, what you've just said...

1040
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:21,280
..is one of the most insanely
idiotic things I have ever heard.

1041
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:25,909
At no point in your rambling,
incoherent response...

1042
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:31,081
..were you even close to anything that
could be considered a rational thought.

1043
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:36,211
Everyone in this room is now dumber
for having listened to it.

1044
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:41,300
I award you no points,
and may God have mercy on your soul.

1045
01:20:42,426 --> 01:20:45,554
OK. A simple ''wrong''
would have done just fine, but...

1046
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,015
You remain one point ahead.

1047
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:52,394
Mr Gordon, it is your turn.
Mr Madison, choose the topic.

1048
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:02,070
I choose Business Ethics.

1049
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:10,329
Mr Gordon. The American business
environment has fundamentally changed...

1050
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:14,291
..following the insider trading
and savings and loan scandals.

1051
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:18,545
Explain business ethics,
and how they are applied today.

1052
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,309
The, uh, ethics of, uh, business...

1053
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:34,895
..can be summarised in...

1054
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,400
Yeah, um...

1055
01:21:40,526 --> 01:21:42,152
See...

1056
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:44,112
Ethics are, uh...

1057
01:21:45,197 --> 01:21:48,367
You know, the... the thing about ethics...

1058
01:21:48,492 --> 01:21:50,536
Aagh!

1059
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:56,792
That question was not fair!
That was not in the reading.

1060
01:21:56,917 --> 01:22:00,420
- I demand a new question.
- Take it easy, psycho.

1061
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:03,340
You blew it. You lose.

1062
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:05,843
I oughta blow you away, you miserable...

1063
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:08,554
Well, go ahead and do it.

1064
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:10,222
Yikes!

1065
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:15,352
No!

1066
01:22:16,603 --> 01:22:18,647
(Eric ) Get off me!

1067
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:25,654
No!

1068
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:35,914
Man, I'm glad I called that guy.

1069
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:44,298
- Max, are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK.

1070
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:45,424
OK.

1071
01:22:45,549 --> 01:22:49,261
A little confused, kinda sweaty,...

1072
01:22:49,386 --> 01:22:51,263
..a little hungry,...

1073
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:54,141
..but all in all I'm OK.

1074
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:08,864
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much. Thank you.

1075
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:14,369
Well, what can I say? I graduated.
It's over. I did it.

1076
01:23:14,495 --> 01:23:19,124
I know most of you are sayin'
''Hey, any idiot could do that.''

1077
01:23:19,249 --> 01:23:23,170
Well, it was tough for me, so back off!

1078
01:23:24,213 --> 01:23:29,885
- Sorry. Sorry about that.
- Yahoo, Billy! Billy's number one! Yahoo!

1079
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,555
(Billy ) That's nice, buddy.

1080
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,265
Yahoo!

1081
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,476
Yahoo for school!

1082
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:39,645
Yahoo for me!

1083
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:45,734
Anyways, this hotel stuff
really isn't for me,...

1084
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:50,948
..so I decided to step down
as chairman of Madison Hotels...

1085
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:53,742
..and give the company to Carl.

1086
01:23:58,622 --> 01:24:02,125
I'm gonna go to college.
I'm gonna be a teacher.

1087
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:08,215
- Peace! I'm outta here!
- (cheering )

1088
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:09,842
Daddy.

1089
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:13,178
What can I say? I saved the day, I guess.

1090
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:16,181
I mean, Eric doesn't
take over the company.

1091
01:24:16,306 --> 01:24:18,684
Are you sure this is what you wanna do?

1092
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:21,687
I'm sure, Dad. Thanks for everything.

1093
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:27,818
Max! What can I say, buddy?
You saved my life.

1094
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:31,446
You don't have to say anything.
I'm so proud of you.

1095
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:34,449
But I'm still horny.

1096
01:24:35,492 --> 01:24:38,162
All right, man. You're hurting me.

1097
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:44,793
You think he's horny.

1098
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:46,962
Come here.
