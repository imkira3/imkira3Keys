Nah, I just go here to dream.

496
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,842
Check out that classy chassis.

497
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:23,179
Whoa! Look at the junk in her trunk, eh?

498

Booyah! Big time.

499
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:29,268
I should not have eaten

Yeah, neck deep!

It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade out here, Jimmy J.

538
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:08,909
You hired me from a want ad
in the <i>Dakota Penny Ledger.</i>

539
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,370
Think that comes with a superpower?

You want to go to federal prison?

No, no, I don't want to go to any prison.

- Did I tell you that?
- Yes, that's what you said.

we all die.

this cannot and will not be the end.

To save Earth and her people,

2274
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:02,399
we are going to steal Quintessa's staff.

2275

Only you, Viviane, can take it back.

2276
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:10,407
I will lead the way into her chamber.
