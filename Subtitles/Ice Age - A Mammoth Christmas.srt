1
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,165
Okay, Ellie, I got her.

2
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:26,067
The Christmas rock.

3
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:27,552
Just got her
out of storage.

4
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,320
I wanted to surprise Peaches.

5
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:31,689
Where is our sweet
little angel? Huh?

6
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:34,242
Incoming!

7
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:37,129
There's your
sweet little angel.

8
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:38,179
Sorry, Dad.

9
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:40,599
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
It's on!

10
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,718
You guys need
to chill out.

11
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:47,956
ELLIE: Peaches.

12
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,808
The Christmas rock!

13
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,927
I love it! I love it!
I love it! I love it!
I love it!

14
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,979
No, no, no, don't.
Too late.

15
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:56,347
I'm stuck.

16
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:01,252
This is the same
Christmas rock I had
when I was a kid.

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,489
It's an heirloom
that's been in our
family for generations.

18
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,757
Tonight when
Santa comes by
with his presents,

19
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:11,563
he'll see this rock and
know that a very special
little girl lives here.

20
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,665
Oh, Christmas rock,
oh, Christmas rock

21
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,986
You're 30 tons of granite
And every...

22
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:20,988
You know you're singing
to a rock, right?

23
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,458
It's a Christmas
tradition for the kids.

24
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:25,493
Don't sabers have
Christmas traditions?

25
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,295
Oh, yeah!

26
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:30,331
Every year my dad
would bring home the biggest,
fattest gazelles he could find

27
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,900
and then we'd
all rip into their...

28
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:36,137
...our presents.

29
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:37,772
And we'd play games
with the gazelles

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,458
and dance with them
and not eat them.
The end.

31
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,927
Merry Christmas,
my mammals.

32
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:46,565
Wow!
That's some crazy rock.

33
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:47,915
Step away from the stone.

34
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:49,517
Why?
You'll break it.

35
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:51,620
Sid can't break a rock.

36
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,187
Don't tempt him.

37
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:55,824
Uncle Sid, we need this
so that Santa can
find us tonight.

38
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,326
What, this?
Oh, pfft.

39
00:02:58,393 --> 00:03:00,295
He could
go right past it.

40
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:03,348
You need something
bigger, taller, sparklier.

41
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:05,483
Something with a pizzazz.

42
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,135
Um, a tree!

43
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,254
A Christmas tree?

44
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:11,789
Do you know
how ridiculous that sounds?

45
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:13,491
There's millions of
trees out there, Sid.

46
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,260
How would anyone
notice this one?

47
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,595
Well, we could
decorate it.

48
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:18,446
Crash, Eddie.

49
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:19,997
Whoo-hoo!

50
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:26,971
Sweet!

51
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,664
And,  voila!

52
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,067
It does look pretty good.

53
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,801
Ah, it'll never catch on.

54
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,169
It's beautiful.

55
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:45,457
Hmm. It needs
a certain razzle-dazzle
on top.

56
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,592
Something that says Sid.

57
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,498
Ooh.

58
00:03:56,635 --> 00:04:00,338
And just like that,
a tradition is born.

59
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,790
Huh?

60
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,376
Hey!

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,199
Seriously, what did
you think was gonna...

62
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,501
Yep. That says
Sid, all right.

63
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:22,343
Okay, okay. Let's just
keep it together.

64
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:25,363
It really is about
the spirit of Christmas,
isn't it?

65
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,065
You're about to be
a spirit of Christmas, Sid!

66
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,284
Manny, please.
I'm so sorry.

67
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,836
You know what, Sid,
I'm the least of your worries.

68
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,672
You gotta answer to Santa.

69
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,957
Santa? Santa Claus?

70
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,143
He is never gonna
forgive this.

71
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,562
You just got
yourself on Santa's...

72
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,749
Uh, ah,
Santa's Naughty List.

73
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,485
Santa has a Naughty List?

74
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:48,986
Yeah! Yeah!

75
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:52,056
And if you're not good,
then he puts your name on it.

76
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:53,491
We're never good.

77
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,759
Then why start now?

78
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,462
Well, if your name's
on the Naughty List,

79
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,265
you don't get Christmas.

80
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,703
But no! Why me?

81
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,322
Besides the fact
that it's my fault.

82
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,558
The Naughty List?
Where did you
come up with that?

83
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:13,594
Relax. Sid's gullible
but he's not that gullible.

84
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,830
He knows this Santa
stuff is just for kids.

85
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,499
What? You don't
believe in Santa?

86
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,251
Um, I, well...

87
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,919
Of course, he believes.

88
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:24,322
That's the magic
of Christmas.

89
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,408
If anyone deserves
to be on the Naughty List,
Dad, it's you!

90
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,195
She sure told you,
didn't she?

91
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:32,297
Well, too bad,
I'm a grown-up.

92
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,532
Grown-ups don't believe
in the Naughty List.

93
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,903
I'm not getting Christmas.

94
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:42,523
Don't cry, Sid.

95
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,791
Why not?

96
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:45,359
Your tears are
freezing solid.

97
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:46,527
Huh?

98
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,896
Why am I on
Santa's Naughty List?

99
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,281
Why? Why?

100
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:59,517
My guess,
because he doesn't
have a loser list.

101
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,336
Well, thanks for
trying to cheer me up.

102
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:02,770
I still feel terrible.

103
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,172
Pull it together,
Uncle Sid.

104
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,573
We've got work to do.

105
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,807
But I'm still sulking.

106
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,143
No time.
We're going to the Pole.

107
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,128
The North one?

108
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,529
Yep. We're gonna
find Santa

109
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,698
so I can prove to my dad
that he's real.

110
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,800
And we're gonna
get you off that list.

111
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:16,968
And us, too!

112
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,670
We may be naughty
but we still want Christmas.

113
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,006
Peaches, honey,
you can't come with us.

114
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,875
This is a very
dangerous journey.

115
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:27,979
The North Pole
is a desolate land
of ice and snow.

116
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,216
This isn't exactly Miami.

117
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,333
Come on, Uncle Sid,

118
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,320
I want us all to have
Christmas together.

119
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:36,788
Hmm. I don't know.

120
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:39,490
It's wildly
irresponsible and impulsive
but let's do it!

121
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:40,725
Northward, ho!

122
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:41,959
CRASH AND EDDIE:
Ho ho ho!

123
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:46,130
Uh, guys,
let's follow
the northern lights.

124
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,315
North. Get it?

125
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:50,467
Northward ho!
Santa ho!

126
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,169
Ho ho ho!

127
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,225
SID:
On the ninth day
of Christmas

128
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:00,761
My true love gave to me
Nine fleas a-biting

129
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:02,380
Eight pounds of ear wax

130
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:03,931
Seven frosty fingers

131
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,666
Six frosty fingers

132
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,801
ALL:
Five rotten...

133
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:08,986
SID: Eggs?

134
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:12,173
Huh. I think we just
marched off the Earth.

135
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,574
No, it's a white-out.

136
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,343
We'll be safe
as long as we all...

137
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:17,678
stay together.

138
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:20,448
Peaches, where are you?

139
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:22,166
Uncle Sid?
Peaches?

140
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:23,868
Uncle Sid?
Peaches?

141
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,270
Huh?

142
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:29,240
Eddie?
Where are you, Eddie?
Oh, wait. I'm Eddie.

143
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:38,399
Okay, everyone,
grab hold of your
buddy and follow me.

144
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,903
I have an excellent
sense of direction.

145
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:44,105
Wait.

146
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,142
Bless you.
Thank you.

147
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,759
Ha! Did you see
what I just did there?

148
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:05,860
Pa-pow!

149
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:07,328
You're a reindeer.

150
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:08,195
Yeah, I know.

151
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:09,997
You can fly!

152
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:10,865
I know!

153
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,683
You're amazing!
I know!

154
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:17,088
Check it out, Sauerkraut.
I can hover, roll and zing.

155
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,039
Zing?
Zing! Bam!

156
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:23,010
What's your name?

157
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:24,929
My name is, um,
uh, Prancer.

158
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,030
Prancer?

159
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:28,882
It's a family name.

160
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,318
Oh, don't listen to them.

161
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:32,820
You saved our lives
and we'll never forget you.

162
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,321
Have a merry Christmas.

163
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,723
Are you sure you
don't need my help?

164
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,575
Oh, no thank you.
You've done
more than enough.

165
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,077
Look, we'll take
it from here.

166
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,496
The reindeer
comes with us.

167
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,115
Uh, what do you think?

168
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:49,136
You want an honest answer
or a Christmas answer?

169
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:51,138
Uh, Christmas answer.

170
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:53,074
It's gorgeous.

171
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:54,525
ELLIE: Manny?
Huh?

172
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,677
Have you seen Peaches?
I can't find her anywhere.

173
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,930
And Sid, Crash and
Eddie are gone, too!

174
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,464
Last I saw them,
they were trying
to figure out

175
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:01,966
how to get off
Santa's Naughty List.

176
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:04,134
What Naughty List?
I made it up!

177
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,202
We gotta find them.

178
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,438
Diego, can you pick
up Sid's scent?

179
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:09,340
I can but it makes
my eyes burn.

180
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,375
BOTH: Do it!

181
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:14,762
Got it.

182
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,953
So, Prancer, how long
will it take us to get
to the, uh, North Pole?

183
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,155
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You can't walk
to the North Pole.

184
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:25,523
It's too far.

185
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,410
But I can fly you there.
No sweat, on Air Prancer.

186
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:30,778
Oh, oh, no,
we couldn't.

187
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:32,629
No, no, no, no.
My family raised me

188
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,866
to be good to strangers
and there's really no one
stranger than you guys.

189
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:36,867
Huh?

190
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:38,252
Shotgun!

191
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:42,389
We've run into
a little turbulence, folks.

192
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:44,358
Please fasten
your seatbelts.

193
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,210
I'm not too heavy, am I?

194
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,012
No, no. You're light
as a feather.

195
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,214
A 788 pound feather.

196
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:53,084
Do you come
equipped with barf bags?

197
00:10:56,472 --> 00:11:00,424
Peaches! Peaches!

198
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:01,976
Manny, where's Diego?

199
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:06,080
Diego! Buddy, are you okay?

200
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:10,451
Glad you didn't kiss me?

201
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:14,388
Are you sure this is North?

202
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,389
I don't know. I...

203
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,958
I'm all scrambled.

204
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:19,660
Wait, tracks!

205
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:21,295
Uh, Diego?

206
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,915
The geomagnetic whatever,

207
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,851
it's messing with
my sense of direction.

208
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,402
Oh, well,
that's just great!

209
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,739
We're completely lost,
my little girl is
missing and...

210
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,424
Manny, honey,
everything's gonna be fine.

211
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:35,559
How?

212
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,495
Just believe in
the magic of Christmas.

213
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,013
Oh, this is silly.

214
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,581
Just try it.
It's not gonna work.

215
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,183
Do it for Peaches.

216
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,419
I believe.

217
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,021
I believe.

218
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:52,292
Manny, look!
The northern lights!

219
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,461
North. Get it?

220
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,564
Um, that was just
a coincidence, right?

221
00:11:57,632 --> 00:12:00,184
Who cares?
I'll take it. Let's go.

222
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:09,927
We must be getting close.

223
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,912
Sugar plums!

224
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:13,980
Peppermint bark!

225
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:17,101
Yellow snow, my favorite!

226
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,636
Don't, just don't.

227
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,722
HEAD MINI SLOTH:
Halt! None shall pass.

228
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:27,011
Oh. Oh, hi, little guy.
So, who are you?

229
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:28,746
We are the Santourage.

230
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:32,550
We keep intruders out
so Santa can do his work
without interruption.

231
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,919
I knew he was real!
You've gotta let us see him.

232
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,387
It is forbidden!

233
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,524
Turn back,
I command you.
Bye!

234
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,993
Oh, yeah?
You and what army?

235
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:47,798
Oh, that army.

236
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,500
Hasta luego.
Feliz Navidad.

237
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:52,036
But you gotta let me in.
I'm on the list!

238
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,238
He must not be disturbed
or we won't get presents.

239
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:58,508
You have been warned.
Unleash heck!

240
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:06,350
Bring it on,
you little fleabags!

241
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:09,187
You're no match
for the power of...

242
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:10,421
flight.

243
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:14,158
Everybody, grab a leg
and pull!

244
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:17,962
Ow! Huh?

245
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,007
Huh? Uh...

246
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:33,878
Run!

247
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:45,256
You better watch out
You better not cry

248
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,259
Better not pout
I'm telling you why

249
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:52,362
I am coming to town

250
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,664
Yes!

251
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,101
Oh, I'm making a list
And checking it twice

252
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,143
Ah, nutmeg!

253
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,928
Ho ho, no!

254
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:19,707
Oh.

255
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:21,608
Sid?

256
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,610
Sid, where's Peaches?

257
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,378
Peaches!
Peaches!

258
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,781
SID: Where are you?

259
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,231
Over here!

260
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,484
Wait, wait.
The reindeer
fly up here?

261
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:31,969
This one does, cuz.

262
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,255
Peaches!
Daddy!

263
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:38,575
Oh, baby, we were so worried
about you.

264
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:41,127
Oh, you...

265
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:43,630
You are so grounded!

266
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:44,882
Sorry, Daddy.

267
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:46,450
I'm talking to Sid.

268
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,301
Sorry, Daddy.

269
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:49,303
SANTA:
Frolicking fruitcake!

270
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:52,723
It's Santa!

271
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,092
Just 'cause
there's a fat guy,
doesn't make him Santa.

272
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:59,230
I'm not fat!
It's this suit,
it's very poofy.

273
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,148
Manny, it is Santa!

274
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,817
And he's just as
old and decrepit
as I imagined.

275
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:05,052
And, oh, so jolly.

276
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,286
Oh, look at this mess.

277
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:08,939
Two hours to Christmas
and everything's ruined!

278
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:12,459
My toys, my sleigh!
All my hard work.

279
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:15,762
Um, would this be
a good time to talk about
getting off the Naughty List?

280
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,380
Sid, there's no such thing.

281
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,784
There is now, Manfred.
Thanks for the idea.

282
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,854
Wait, wait!
How do you know my...

283
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:26,924
...name?

284
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,726
Santa?

285
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:30,327
Hey, what did we do?

286
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,962
Ahem.

287
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,865
Oh, right.
Destroyed Christmas.

288
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,900
Peaches, you were...
I mean, I mean, I was...

289
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:39,437
That's Santa!
Standing right there.

290
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:40,871
He's real!

291
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,239
Duh!

292
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,342
There's gonna be
a lot of disappointed kids
tomorrow morning.

293
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:47,494
Ow!

294
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:54,718
There's gotta be
a way to fix this.

295
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:58,072
Dad, it's impossible!
There's only eight of us.

296
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:01,191
And 800 of them!

297
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:03,427
Wait, us?
You mean, as in, us?

298
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,446
You never thought
to give the old fat boy
a hand, huh?

299
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:07,681
Come on, Peach.

300
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,950
You taught me to believe.
What do you say?

301
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:13,921
Hit it! Ow! Not me!

302
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:18,142
Dead moss and rock weed

303
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:19,226
BOTH:
Fa-la-la-la-la

304
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:20,560
BOTH: What's a hall?

305
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,362
Tis the season...
What's a season?

306
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,497
Fa-la-la-la-la

307
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:24,832
Just play along.

308
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,733
I can fix this, Mr. Santa

309
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:28,652
We can
fa-la-la-la-la-along

310
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,887
Give a sloth a chance
Now, can't you?

311
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:33,607
Too many "la's"
are in this song

312
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,945
I have no idea
why I just did that.

313
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:41,832
That's a toy!
And that's a toy!

314
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,335
And this?
This is no good
for anything.

315
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:47,571
Sid has got
the proper spirit

316
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,489
Fa-la-la-la-la

317
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:49,523
Hey, not too bad.

318
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,725
Beautiful!
Don't let Sid near it.

319
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:52,693
Fa-la-la-la-la

320
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,044
Come on now, Dad.

321
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,912
We can do it
If we hurry

322
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,914
Lend a claw
Lend a paw

323
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:57,948
Everyone

324
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,284
Even if you're
small and furry

325
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:02,703
All together
we can get it done

326
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:05,222
A ball of twine?
Who's gonna want that?

327
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:08,425
Whoo! All right!

328
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:09,660
What do we do with this?

329
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,579
Oh, why don't
we put it here.

330
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:12,646
Hey!

331
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,581
Something about
that mistletoe...

332
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,700
This shall go
down in the annals

333
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:17,667
Fa-la-la-la-la

334
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:19,136
And we're not through

335
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,787
Peace and goodwill
towards all mammals

336
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,889
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Just for you.

337
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:29,096
Things were looking
grim and tragic

338
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:31,098
But we got busy
and pulled it off

339
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,484
Now we found
some Christmas magic

340
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,803
All because of
each and every sloth

341
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:39,590
"All because of
each and every sloth"?

342
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:41,242
All because of each

343
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:46,547
And everyone

344
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,867
I can't believe it.
These presents!

345
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,137
The decorations!
This sleigh!

346
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:54,888
Ain't she fly?

347
00:17:55,056 --> 00:18:00,427
I bet the mini sloths
could help you make presents
every year! Right, guys?

348
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,062
Well, we're gonna
need hats.

349
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,780
Cute hats.

350
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:07,234
In fact, it looks like
you got enough toys
for every child on Earth.

351
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:09,636
Every child?
Around the world?

352
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:12,105
I wish I could,
but I don't see how.

353
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:15,726
Santa,
I'm giving you the biggest
Christmas gift of all.

354
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,262
Me! You're flying
Air Prancer tonight.

355
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,232
Oh, that's the spirit,
Prancy boy!

356
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,585
Time to put this
deer in high gear.

357
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:26,070
Vroom, vroom!

358
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,238
Um...

359
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:29,390
Up, up and away!

360
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:30,757
Come on!

361
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,626
Saving Christmas
here we go!

362
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,095
Anytime you're ready.

363
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,563
I can't believe it!

364
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,398
I failed.

365
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:41,035
Huh?

366
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:43,921
This family doesn't
give up that easy.

367
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,221
All right, Dad!

368
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:47,575
Come on, Prancer.
We have to keep trying.

369
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:49,443
You're the only flying
reindeer we've got.

370
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,578
Unless you know
10 others.

371
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:53,864
You're right.
I can't do this alone.

372
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,601
Wait, where you going?

373
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,370
Perfect.

374
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,505
Wow! Heck of a day,
eh, Santa?

375
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,208
Come on! Ho ho ho.

376
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,977
Oh. Still on the
Naughty List, huh?

377
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:15,168
Okay, so we traveled
about 30 feet so far.

378
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:17,721
If we keep up this pace,
we should make it around
the world in what?

379
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,823
Let's say just under
8000 years?

380
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,409
Bah, humbug!

381
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:24,244
Hey, guys!
Manny's right!

382
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:26,747
Nothing's impossible
if you pull together.

383
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,882
Meet my family.

384
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:33,020
Dasher, Dancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner...

385
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:34,188
Whoa!

386
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:35,406
PRANCER:
...and Blitzen.

387
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:37,591
Blitzen?

388
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,259
And I thought
Prancer was bad!

389
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:44,731
Nice name.

390
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,966
It suits you.

391
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:49,720
Thanks, Prancer.

392
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,271
I thought I was
such a hotshot,

393
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,290
but sometimes you
gotta have a little help.

394
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,658
That's what this herd
has taught me...

395
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:56,227
Stay.

396
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,030
...among other things.

397
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:01,565
Now, let's do this.

398
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,241
Ha-ha! Yeah!

399
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:18,499
Hey, Manfred, nice job!

400
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:29,359
I got Christmas!

401
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,528
See what happens
when you believe, Dad?

402
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,064
I gotta say,
I'm kinda digging
the holiday magic.

403
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,100
Merry Christmas, you two.

404
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,267
SANTA: Ho ho ho!

405
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:38,368
All right! Whoo-hoo!

406
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:39,319
Yeah!

407
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:42,422
Merry Christmas!
