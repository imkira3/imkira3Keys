1
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,029
Fuck.

2
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,776
Fucking fuck!

3
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,486
Watch it, old man.

4
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,705
What the fuck? You're doing it wrong!

5
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,625
Needle is doing what the needle does.

6
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,836
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

7
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,005
The irezumi does not hide the skin.

8
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,758
The tattoo reveals
the nature of the man...

9
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,845
...and illuminates the four noble
professions in The Book of Five Rings:

10
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,183
The warrior, the artist, the merchant
and the farmer.

11
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,811
If there is a conflict
between the needle and the skin...

12
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,605
...between the mark and the man...

13
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,943
...then perhaps the path you've chosen
is not the path for which you're suited.

14
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,154
What did you just say, old man?

15
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,489
Huh?

16
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,367
I know you didn't just disrespect me,
did you?

17
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,452
You that fucking stupid?

18
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,039
You disrespect me and I'll tattoo
the ceiling with your fucking brains.

19
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,378
No disrespect.

20
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,297
You're lucky.

21
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,343
I can't kill you
until you finish this thing. Bang.

22
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,887
Give me that mirror.

23
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,056
Let's see how it's looking.

24
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,766
Not bad, not bad.

25
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,893
Hey, boss. This just came for you.

26
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,437
- What is it?
- A letter.

27
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,314
So open it, dumbass.

28
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,487
What?

29
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,949
- What is it?
- It looks like sand.

30
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,661
Yep. Sand.

31
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,997
- Black sand.
- No.

32
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,293
You know what this is?

33
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,379
You wanna let us in on the joke?

34
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:57,092
Years ago I watched a man
open an envelope like that one.

35
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,428
There were many with him.

36
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,557
And they laughed as you laugh now.

37
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,519
And then it came from the shadows...

38
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,023
...and their laughter
was drowned in blood.

39
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,944
What came out of the shadows?

40
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,946
I cannot say the word.

41
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,948
What word?

42
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,120
That night...

43
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,165
...one of their blades struck here.

44
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,210
I should have died
but for an accident of birth.

45
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:36,256
My heart is here, on the other side.

46
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,636
The fuck is that?

47
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,305
It looks like a ninja, boss.

48
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,933
A ninja?

49
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,062
Are you kidding me? That's the word
you're afraid to say? Ninja?

50
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,149
Ninja, ninja, ninja.
Yeah, you old fuck.

51
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,902
Yeah, you had me going.

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,657
- Ninja. That's some good shit.
- Ninja.

53
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,848
Wanna fuck with me, huh?

54
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,645
Wanna fuck with me?

55
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:19,276
Look, you don't have to do this.

56
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,946
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.

57
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,406
I'll triple it.

58
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,074
You hear me?

59
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,076
I'll pay you whatever you want.

60
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,746
You cannot bargain with it,
you cannot reason with it...

61
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,041
...because it is not a human being.

62
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,085
It is a demon sent straight from hell.

63
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,879
You shut your face, old man!

64
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,964
I'll blow your fuck--

65
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,322
For 57 years, I've told your story.

66
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,952
No one ever believed me,
but you are real, aren't you?

67
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,807
Is all that for the Delgata case?

68
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,726
This is Delgata.

69
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,270
- And the rest?
- Evidence.

70
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,980
For?

71
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,191
Oh, no, not again, Mika, please.

72
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,902
What is the problem?
You've trusted my research before.

73
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,030
Here's a question. Which of these
does not belong in this sentence:

74
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:51,118
Laptop, space shuttle,
nanotechnology, ninja.

75
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,913
All I'm asking for is an hour.
That's all.

76
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,751
Why do I think I'm gonna regret this?

77
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,628
Remember the Eulmi incident?

78
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,673
Korean queen, late 1800s,
killed by one of these ninja clans.

79
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,716
Ozunu, I think.

80
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,554
Now, I've been going through
the original transcripts of the trial...

81
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,930
...of Kunitomo Shigeaki.

82
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,935
The prosecutor questioned Shigeaki
about a payment of 100 pounds of gold.

83
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,439
Shigeaki answered that he didn't know
what the prosecutor was talking about.

84
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,357
The question
was never brought up again.

85
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,985
But what pinged for me was the amount.

86
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,238
The exact same amount rumored
to have been paid to the Ozunu Clan...

87
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,783
...for the yakuza massacre that happened
last week in Osaka.

88
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,952
So you wonder,
in this ever-changing world...

89
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,204
...if the cost of a man's life
remains the same.

90
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,208
Exactly. I mean, I figure these clans
are like, what, a thousand years old?

91
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,710
They probably don't change.

92
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,922
So I started looking at
international wire transfers...

93
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,510
...targeting banks in the regions
of several high-profile assassinations.

94
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,054
And bingo.
Russian Prime Minister Zhukov.

95
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,307
The day before the assassination...

96
00:07:55,475 --> 00:08:00,395
...$1,555,999 and 90 cents...

97
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,148
...was transferred
from the Bank of Shanghai.

98
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,860
That is the exact market equivalent
of 100 pounds of gold.

99
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,282
- Okay, you got me, this is interesting.
- The clans are real, Ryan.

100
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,619
They steal children
and turn them into assassins.

101
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,163
Look, Mika, no one's denying
the historical facts...

102
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,749
...but this thing doesn't make sense
in a modern world.

103
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,377
They're real. You can call them spooks
or assassins or whatever you want...

104
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:28,757
...if it makes you feel better, but they are
out there and they are killing people.

105
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,092
And nobody is doing a damn thing
to stop them.

106
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,685
Hi. Excuse me.

107
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,270
Would you mind?

108
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,941
If it's not too much trouble,
could you help me with this?

109
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,708
What clan are you from?

110
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,962
What are you doing in Berlin?

111
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,547
I don't understand.

112
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,821
What is going on?

113
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,671
You found something?

114
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,341
I was digging around trying to see
what I could come up with and I found this.

115
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,011
A report. A friend of mine in Moscow
tipped me to it.

116
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,054
It was written during the Cold War...

117
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,891
...by a high-ranking KGB agent
named Alexi Sabatin.

118
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,312
He raises the possibility that
a number of political assassinations...

119
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,189
...were conducted by an ancient
but sophisticated network...

120
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,859
...he calls the Nine Clans.

121
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,988
- Mind you, he doesn't call them ninjas.
- What happened to him?

122
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,866
Same thing that's gonna happen to me
if I hang around with you.

123
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,453
Kicked out of the service
for mental instability.

124
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,164
You believe it now, don't you?

125
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,083
Ninjas.

126
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,378
- You gotta be joking.
- Well, then why are you doing all this?

127
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
I don't know.

128
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,300
But I can guarantee you
it has nothing to do with the fact...

129
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,678
...that you're the most attractive
researcher I have ever worked with.

130
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,067
Oh, Mr. Nan.

131
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,485
Good, you are back.

132
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,072
We had a heating problem,
and I had to go into your apartment.

133
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,451
- Is it all right?
- It's all fixed.

134
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,953
You keep it very dark and spare in there.

135
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,415
And forgive me, but I couldn't help
noticing your suitcases.

136
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,754
I told you,
my father was a very sick man.

137
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,589
Do you have to leave Berlin soon?

138
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,509
Not yet, but I am expecting a phone call.

139
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,761
I'm sorry to hear that.

140
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:24,057
One day, death will come for us all.

141
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,577
Wherever you are...

142
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,081
...wherever you may go...

143
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,755
...you must never forget who you are...

144
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,675
...how you came to be.

145
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,261
You are Ozunu.

146
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,139
You are part of me...

147
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,766
...as I am part of you.

148
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,478
This is the truth of your lives...

149
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,107
...and it will remain true after death.

150
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,153
This is my new son.

151
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,407
I have given him the name Raizo.

152
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,410
Welcome him as your brother.

153
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,037
Welcome, Raizo.

154
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,853
The body must obey the will.

155
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,813
Hunger and thirst...

156
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:58,151
...even the blood in your veins,
are the body's weakness.

157
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,494
Master them...

158
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,915
...and you master the self.

159
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:22,050
This is the power of the Ozunu Clan.

160
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,886
This is the way of the ninja.

161
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,725
Eat tonight and you work
twice as hard tomorrow.

162
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,962
What is the lesson?

163
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,756
Look at your brother.

164
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,259
Life is combat.

165
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,262
You know this truth.

166
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,265
Abandoned by your parents...

167
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,102
...without a home,
without people to care for you...

168
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,688
...you should have died.

169
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,773
But instead you fought.

170
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:23,528
As you did here today,
you fought and you won.

171
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:29,367
In combat, you face the enemy
without doubt, without pity or remorse.

172
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,121
To survive, you must learn
to fear nothing at all.

173
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,568
Pain breeds weakness.

174
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,325
Remember, suffering exists...

175
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,329
...only because weakness exists.

176
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,683
You must hate all weakness.

177
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:39,812
Hate it in others,
but most of all, hate it in yourself.

178
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,635
- Mrs. Sabatin?
- Yeah.

179
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,139
I'm Mika Coretti with Europol.
We spoke on the phone.

180
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,603
You said you read
my husband's report, yes?

181
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,812
Yes.

182
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,942
I understand the report caused some
problems for him within the KGB.

183
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,237
The report caused problems
for Alexi's career...

184
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:58,201
...the way Moses caused problems
for the Pharaoh. Very unpleasant.

185
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,494
What happened?

186
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,829
About two years ago...

187
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,499
...after the assassination of Zhukov...

188
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,002
...the report drew attention.

189
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,962
After that...

190
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,464
...everything was different.

191
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:17,637
Alexi hired men to change all the locks
and put in more of them.

192
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,598
Locks on the windows,
locks on the doors, locks on the locks.

193
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,184
He put in cameras and motion sensors...

194
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,771
...and lights. Everywhere, lights.

195
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,024
"There can be no shadows," he said.

196
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,819
"No shadows."

197
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,365
Then one day, a man came to the door.

198
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,660
They talked in Alexi's study
for some time, and then...

199
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,579
...the young man left.

200
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,541
My husband was a soldier.

201
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,502
Member of Russian intelligence.

202
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,838
He was not a man to frighten easily.

203
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:57,385
But when I came to the door,
in his eyes I saw fear.

204
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,054
And then he stood up...

205
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,392
...he kissed me and told me
that he loved me very much.

206
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,396
He said...

207
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,234
...I should always remember that.

208
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,904
Do you know what they talked about?

209
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,867
No. He said it was safer that way.

210
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,828
Can I ask how he died?

211
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,708
The lights went out.

212
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,552
You are the first person who has
taken my husband's work seriously.

213
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:45,266
It would be good to know
that he did not die without cause.

214
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,403
He would want you to have this.

215
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,919
Who are you?

216
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,871
Hiyah!

217
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,120
Did Takeshi's blow hurt you?

218
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,623
You think this is pain.

219
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,458
You are mistaken.

220
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,977
That is true pain.

221
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,814
Here is your test, Raizo.

222
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,649
Survive the night.

223
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,712
Very good, Raizo.

224
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,839
Very good.

225
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,020
Boy, you're like a dog with a bone
on that computer, aren't you?

226
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,229
Excuse me?

227
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,565
Agent Zabranski...

228
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,734
...internal Affairs.

229
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,403
Need to ask you a couple of questions.

230
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,615
- You're Mika Coretti, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

231
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,117
Forensic researcher.

232
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,661
You work a lot with Agent Maslow,
that right?

233
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,997
A few cases, yeah.

234
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,917
You have something
of a social relationship.

235
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:06,587
- Excuse me?
- You had lunch with him on the 13th...

236
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,756
...and again on the 18th.

237
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,257
How do you know that?

238
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,011
- Isn't it true?
- I'm not sure.

239
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,516
We do have lunch together sometimes,
but that's usually when we're working.

240
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,186
Has Agent Maslow seemed different
to you lately in any way?

241
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,940
I mean, has he said or done anything
that struck you as unusual?

242
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,609
No. Why?

243
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,819
Has Agent Maslow done something?

244
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,531
Just routine.

245
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,450
The agency cares about
its field operatives.

246
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,204
We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue...

247
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,705
...mental exhaustion.

248
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,209
Agent Maslow has a serious caseload.

249
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,423
That much work can wear on a man.

250
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,056
- Zabranski came to my office.
- Yeah, I got a surprise visit too.

251
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,642
- He made it real clear, Ryan.
- They're watching us.

252
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,815
I don't get the full picture quite yet,
but I know a warning when I see one.

253
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,859
- But why?
- Why? It's obvious.

254
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,946
If this little fantasy of yours
has any chance of being real...

255
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,866
...then these clans are gonna have
some pretty major juice protecting them.

256
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,743
So, what are you gonna do?

257
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,998
We are gonna tiptoe very carefully
from here on in, you understand?

258
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,625
You do nothing without
checking with me first.

259
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,878
- Got it?
- Got it.

260
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:57,323
A 14th-century scroll refers to
one of the oldest of the Nine Clans...

261
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,658
...as the Clan of Black Sand.

262
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,539
The Islamic explorer Ibn Battuta
journeyed with a group of orphans...

263
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,459
...that were being taken
to a remote shido...

264
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,045
...hidden among snow capped mountains.

265
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,465
Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner...

266
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,468
...followed by a display of martial skill.

267
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,805
The combatants were children,
neither beyond the age of 10.

268
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:27,394
His hosts explained that a man's life
must be made meaningless...

269
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,688
...compared to the life of the clan.

270
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,149
Own the meaning of a man's life...

271
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,735
...and you own his heart.

272
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:10,145
You shouldn't do that. It's against
the rules. If they catch you...

273
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,023
- Then they catch me.
- They'll put you in the box.

274
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:18,112
I believe the heart of the tree
knows which way it needs to grow.

275
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,409
- Trees don't have hearts.
- Everything has a heart.

276
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,787
I don't.

277
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,455
Really?

278
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,374
Let me see.

279
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,255
Hello?

280
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,136
It's saying hello back...

281
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,973
...and that it's happy to meet me,
but it misses you.

282
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,977
- Liar.
- I'm not lying.

283
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,604
Listen to mine.

284
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,406
For an entire year, you shall live
without one of your senses...

285
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,368
...beginning with the sense
you rely on the most.

286
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,058
You must see with more than your eyes.

287
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,619
Cut him, Kiriko.

288
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,538
All failure must be sown into the flesh.

289
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,792
Cut him.

290
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,852
You know the law.

291
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,265
I told you.

292
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,642
I tried to warn you.

293
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,353
Yes.

294
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,981
You did.

295
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,108
Why, Kiriko?

296
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,487
Why?

297
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,658
Why am I in here...

298
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,454
...or why are you out there?

299
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,052
Kiriko!

300
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,388
Why are you doing this?

301
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,974
I have to.

302
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,562
You know the law.
He will cut your heart from your chest.

303
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,523
No.

304
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,692
He can never touch my heart.

305
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,755
Come with me.

306
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,050
Where? What is out there?

307
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,344
Life.

308
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,643
My life is here.

309
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,458
Shh.

310
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,293
Fucking Christ, Ryan.

311
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:39,839
I'm sorry I couldn't talk earlier, Mika.
They're watching me. Get in.

312
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,808
Where have you been?
I've been calling your office.

313
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,643
Now I know how Sabatin must have felt.

314
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,103
What's happened?

315
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,064
Right now I've got
Internal Affairs, Homeland Security...

316
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,192
...the CIA and for all I know
the Martian military in my office...

317
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,777
...tearing the place apart.

318
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,988
What are we gonna do?

319
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,365
You are gonna pack your bags,
go on holiday.

320
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,533
No way.

321
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,910
Don't argue.
I trusted you, you gotta trust me.

322
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,538
I'm sorry, I can't let you lose
your job because of me.

323
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,791
I'm not talking about losing my job.
Take this.

324
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,044
It's clean, untraceable, no serial number.

325
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,214
- Ryan?
- Yeah, I know.

326
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,552
I've investigated world bank organizations,
drug cartels, arms dealers.

327
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,096
I've never faced this kind of heat.

328
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,391
For ninjas. It's fucking unbelievable.

329
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,646
Excuse me.

330
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,233
- Hey.
- Hi.

331
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,402
So, what's going on?

332
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:47,907
Power's out. Us, the building behind us,
and that one across the street.

333
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,910
It seems like every few months,
boom, the light's out.

334
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,289
Okay.

335
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,333
Thanks.

336
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,355
Ah!

337
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,389
- More will come.
- What?

338
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,433
They won't stop until you're dead.

339
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,393
Oh, God.

340
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,729
A gun won't help you.

341
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,981
Well, I don't have
a lot of options, okay?

342
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,441
I once took a Tae Bo class...

343
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,569
...but that is the extent
of my kung-fu abilities, all right?

344
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,198
I can help you, but you have to trust me.

345
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,787
Okay.

346
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,096
Do you know me?

347
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,309
How?

348
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,607
Security camera in New York
recorded you fighting one of them.

349
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,858
You know about them?

350
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,611
A little.

351
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,364
Well, there are these clans.

352
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:19,077
And, apparently, they've been
supplying assassins to governments...

353
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,412
...or anyone who has
100 pounds of gold...

354
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,457
...for the last thousand years.

355
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,793
His name was Jin.

356
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,713
Wait, you knew him?

357
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,133
- He was not born an assassin.
- You're from his clan.

358
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,929
- They why did you stop him?
- They're coming.

359
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,306
Who?

360
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:51,818
It was him, the traitor, Raizo. Murderer.

361
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,322
- Fresh kill.
- He's with the girl.

362
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,824
Still close.

363
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,410
Very close.

364
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,126
Run, little brother, run.

365
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,839
Weakness compels strength.

366
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,508
Betrayal begets blood.

367
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,094
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

368
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,304
Ah!

369
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,376
We have been betrayed.

370
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:54,881
A child of mine, my daughter,
betrayed us.

371
00:43:55,049 --> 00:44:00,094
She refused my gifts, rejected our clan.

372
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:05,058
Her shame can only be purged
with blood.

373
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,060
You.

374
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:15,526
You, my son, who returned her
shall have this honor.

375
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,809
Ah!

376
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,867
- Where are we going?
- Doesn't matter.

377
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,287
You think they're following us?

378
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,081
I know they're following us.

379
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,625
I don't see anything back there.

380
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,794
They have our scent.

381
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,255
Following our scent? Like dogs?

382
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,091
No. Like wolves.

383
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,721
My name's Mika, by the way.

384
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,768
Raizo is the name I was given.

385
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,979
So you're an orphan?

386
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:40,611
If it's okay with you, I'm gonna try
and fill in some of the blanks here.

387
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:45,992
So you must have been taken by
the Ozunu Clan, trained to be an assassin...

388
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,829
...but something happened and you
decided to opt out of the program.

389
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,665
Now, I don't imagine
that went over so well.

390
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,501
Since they're after me
for just peeking through the keyhole...

391
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,754
...they must be after you
in, like, a major way.

392
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,174
But you're also after them,
which is why you're in Berlin.

393
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,051
Because Sabatin is one of the few people
pursuing the clans...

394
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,179
...which is why they took him out.

395
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,183
But here's a question I can't answer.

396
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,352
Why did you save me?

397
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,326
Your entire life has brought you
to this moment.

398
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,370
Do not fail yourself.

399
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,040
Do not fail your family.

400
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,045
He's wearing a gold watch.

401
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,714
Bring it to me.

402
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,588
That kind of tickled.

403
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,266
It's gonna take more than a knitting needle
to fuck me up, boy!

404
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,556
Ah!

405
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,696
Keep it.

406
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,531
It will remind you that...

407
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,661
...every moment of your life
is a gift I have given you.

408
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,708
You have made me proud, my son.

409
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,796
Now the time has come
for you to prove...

410
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,507
...you are true Ozunu.

411
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,557
She tried to run from us...

412
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,519
...from our family.

413
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:48,943
Takeshi caught her
and returned her to us.

414
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,531
Weakness compels strength.

415
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,033
Betrayal begets blood.

416
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,423
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

417
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,815
Hiyah!

418
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,362
Kill him!

419
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,132
You need protection.

420
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:40,137
No. I want Ozunu,
and I need your help to get him.

421
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,016
Exit here.

422
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:55,444
- You are a size 36?
- What?

423
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,363
No, size 34.

424
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,411
If you leave while I'm gone...

425
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,789
...they'll hunt you and kill you.

426
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,833
Do you understand?

427
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:28,936
Get undressed.

428
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,648
Shower, but do not use soap.
Do you smoke?

429
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,235
Put your clothes in here.

430
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,657
These jeans are a little tight.

431
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,994
You said 34.

432
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:51,417
Yeah, well, it's German sizes.
They must run a little small, I guess.

433
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,258
This is for our scent. Right?

434
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,011
Let's go.

435
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,892
- Yeah?
- Ryan, it's me.

436
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,645
- Mika, I've been calling you for hours.
- I know, I'm in a bit of trouble.

437
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,606
You miss jury service, you're in trouble.

438
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,816
You're in the deepest shit
you've ever been in.

439
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,776
At least I'm not down here by myself.

440
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,070
Sabatin's guy from the tape?
Is he with you?

441
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,739
He's on our side, Ryan.

442
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,283
He wants Ozunu,
but he needs the agency's help.

443
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,119
- Be careful, Mika.
- I trust him.

444
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:31,415
All right, look, I can't make any promises,
but if he cooperates, I'll do what I can.

445
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,459
- Can you meet us?
- Where?

446
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,544
How about the usual?

447
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,386
There he is.

448
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,350
Now, it's all right. He's a good guy.

449
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,020
- Mika, are you okay?
- Yeah.

450
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,855
Thanks to him.

451
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,900
- Why have you done this?
- Done what?

452
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,610
People will die.

453
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,987
- Now!
- No!

454
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,073
Don't move!

455
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,830
This is wrong! No! No!

456
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,666
Charlie 2, do you read me?

457
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,168
Move him!

458
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,004
What the fuck are you doing?

459
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,881
Following orders.

460
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,512
- Prisoner is secure, sir.
- Right.

461
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,265
Sure doesn't look like
a killing machine to me, sir.

462
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,684
Looks like he belongs in a boy band.

463
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,189
He couldn't have heard that. Could he?

464
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,442
- Sir?
- Ryan? This is wrong.

465
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,444
I mean, it can't be legal.

466
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,990
What is this place?
Your own private Guantanamo?

467
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,910
It's an old GDR safe house.
Jamison wants this off the grid.

468
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,705
You're making a huge mistake.

469
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,540
I don't think so.

470
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:58,377
I got reports from London, Washington
and Osaka, all tagging your boy.

471
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,046
The only problem we have
is where to extradite him first.

472
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,382
Two weeks ago,
there's no such thing as ninja...

473
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,011
...and now every city in the world
has a warrant for one?

474
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,346
- He is not the enemy.
- He's a killer, Mika.

475
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,682
Weren't you telling me
it was our job to stop him?

476
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,893
- You're not even listening.
- You're not saying anything worth hearing.

477
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,605
Wanna do the insubordination tango?
Let's go. But not in front of the children.

478
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,653
Boys, get out.

479
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,989
Come on, let's go!

480
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,159
Damn it, I am just trying to--

481
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,661
Shut up and listen to me.
We don't have much time.

482
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,830
Now I don't know
what we've stumbled into...

483
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,249
...but somebody's pulling
some major strings inside.

484
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:41,754
They want him dead.
He's been fighting them for years.

485
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,089
I believe you.

486
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,884
I've been in this business too long
not to smell a setup...

487
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,428
...but we have to be very careful
how we handle this...

488
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,765
...and I cannot risk
you going AWOL on me again.

489
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,558
Now, if you get into trouble...

490
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,770
...you switch this on...

491
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,939
...and no matter where you are,
I'll find you.

492
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,296
Hey.

493
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,802
You looked thirsty.

494
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,458
I'm sorry,
I didn't know about any of this.

495
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,837
- I know.
- You do?

496
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,507
The only time you lied to me
was when you told me your size.

497
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,470
How did you know that?

498
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,099
Your heart. It is special.

499
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:27,025
- Maslow's on our side.
- He's gonna try to help you.

500
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,570
It's too late.

501
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,197
No one goes here.

502
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,283
Ryan? Ryan, can I talk to you?

503
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,452
Do we have to do this again, Coretti?

504
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,871
I just...

505
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:42,082
I have reason to believe a group
of ninja may be on their way.

506
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,003
I think these gentlemen can handle a few
wackjobs wearing pajamas, am I right?

507
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,214
- You see?
- Yeah, but the situation we discussed...

508
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,382
I'm working on that.

509
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,593
- You have to give me time.
- We don't have time.

510
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,762
- They're not here now, are they?
- They'll be here soon.

511
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:56,972
How soon?

512
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,060
Raizo.

513
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,731
- Mika! Go with her, secure the prisoner.
- Go, go, go.

514
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,693
Team two, we're
on our way down to the holding cell.

515
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:10,903
What's your 20?

516
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,739
We're just now entering section four.

517
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,428
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

518
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,680
- Good way to get killed.
- I need that cell open.

519
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,266
- We're moving the prisoner.
- Those are not my orders.

520
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,310
- Mika! Get out of here!
- Not without you!

521
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,313
Then we all die together.

522
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,959
Open fire! Multiple targets!

523
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,808
- Open that gate.
- I can't do that.

524
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,269
Go to infrared, boys.

525
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,021
They're already in the room.

526
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,072
Open fire!

527
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,492
We're under attack! Unknown number!

528
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,254
Shit.

529
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,390
Oh, Mika, Mika.

530
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,600
Shh.

531
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,228
I like you more and more.

532
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,773
Okay, all right.

533
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,778
Shit.

534
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,619
- Mika, hurry.
- Okay.

535
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:28,040
Mika, I don't wanna sound critical...

536
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,459
Look, I'm doing the best I can here.

537
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,381
- We don't have much time!
- Shit!

538
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,722
Let's go.

539
01:00:58,905 --> 01:00:59,946
Oh, God.

540
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,784
We are heavily
engaged with the enemy, I repea--

541
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,581
Wait here.

542
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,285
Let's go.

543
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,749
We got two men over on the side!

544
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,962
Get down, get down!

545
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,922
Look out!

546
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,946
The car's upstairs. Go.

547
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,409
- Go now.
- Okay.

548
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,998
Murderer.

549
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,917
Traitor. So long, brother.

550
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:41,548
Vengeance, betrayal begets blood,
brother. Murderer.

551
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:46,011
- Death. Kill. Murderer. Kill him.
- Just. Vengeance.

552
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,223
Little brother.

553
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,725
Come on, Raizo.

554
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,462
Raizo, where are you?

555
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,012
Shit.

556
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:19,975
Ah!

557
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,064
Fuck!

558
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,235
Shit. Oh, my God. Okay.

559
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,489
Okay.

560
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,037
Oh, my God!

561
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,486
Come on!

562
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,326
Watch it! Help!

563
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:40,573
Ah!

564
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,178
Goodbye, little brother.

565
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,723
Get in!

566
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,697
I can't believe I found you.

567
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,116
I was waiting for you.

568
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,586
- Ugh!
- Oh, God.

569
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,755
I have to get you to a hospital.

570
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,091
No. Not a hospital.

571
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,803
Just keep moving.

572
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,559
- Mika, where are you?
- He told me to keep moving.

573
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,895
- Is he still alive?
- After a fashion.

574
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,606
Jesus Christ.
Listen, I'm gonna bring you in.

575
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,775
- No, not this time.
- There are too many people involved.

576
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,778
- It's just a matter of time.
- I don't think we have much time.

577
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,323
Mika.

578
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:04,908
Shit.

579
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:52,372
I know you can't hear me...

580
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,292
...so I'm sure this doesn't matter...

581
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,962
...but I'm gonna say it anyway.

582
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,676
I'm just a forensic researcher.

583
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:10,890
It's like a fancy way of saying
I'm a librarian.

584
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,354
By myself, I can't do anything
to help you.

585
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,403
I wanted to thank you for saving my life.

586
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,209
And I hope you can forgive me for this.

587
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:41,337
- Agent Maslow! The tracking device.
- Yeah?

588
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:44,257
- You got a lock?
- Triangulating her position now.

589
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:48,594
I want the International Task Force
mobilized and ready to go in five minutes.

590
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,736
At last.

591
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,404
Kill him.

592
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,739
Slit his throat.

593
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,073
No.

594
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:12,577
Our father should have the honor.

595
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:16,247
- Take him to Father.
- Bring him to Father.

596
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:34,640
- Clear.
- Clear.

597
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,611
They took him 10 minutes ago.

598
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:49,697
He's gone.

599
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:20,645
You are Ozunu.

600
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:26,484
You are part of me, as I am part of you.

601
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,988
This is the truth of your lives.

602
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:36,953
And it will remain true after death.

603
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:28,212
My child.

604
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:32,592
It is good to see you again.

605
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:40,933
Do you know there was a time...

606
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:44,896
...when I looked at you...

607
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:47,023
...I felt such pride.

608
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:53,488
No child ever showed more promise.

609
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:58,576
You are the son I was waiting for...

610
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,703
...the one to take my place.

611
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:10,338
And now, do you know
what you have done?

612
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:14,759
How you have shamed my family?

613
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,970
How you have hurt me?

614
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:24,435
Why do you think I did it?

615
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,400
Get this thing...

616
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:33,778
...out of my sight.

617
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:49,460
Tonight we avenge
our brothers and sisters.

618
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,091
Tonight we avenge our honor.

619
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:03,849
Let this death be remembered
for a thousand years.

620
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:17,113
Weakness compels strength.

621
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:26,080
Betrayal begets blood.

622
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,916
Ah!

623
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,923
You are getting weak...

624
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:38,551
...old man.

625
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,762
Ah!

626
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:57,361
Father!

627
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,130
Move it!

628
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,191
Shit!

629
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,823
- What took you?
- You knew I'd come?

630
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,285
Just because I was asleep
doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.

631
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,412
And I forgive you.

632
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,499
Mika!

633
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,339
Come, this way.

634
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,944
You swore to me
you'd stay inside the APC.

635
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,780
- I thought we were too late.
- First team is ready, sir!

636
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,533
- Hit it!
- Go!

637
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,125
Stay here.

638
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:50,808
You two, with me!

639
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,334
Come, little brother.

640
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:20,212
Let us play like old times.

641
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:32,683
Ah!

642
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:41,358
Ah!

643
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,215
Ah!

644
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,219
My turn.

645
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,846
Watch the roof!

646
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,279
Do you still think about her?

647
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,950
Do you remember the sound she made
when I stuck her?

648
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:15,911
Ah!

649
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,433
Ugh!

650
01:21:44,774 --> 01:21:46,483
Ah!

651
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:48,611
Ah!

652
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:55,409
Watch the roof!

653
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,788
- Three o'clock!
- I need a solid perimeter on the left, now!

654
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,393
You remember...

655
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:23,646
...all I taught you.

656
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:44,208
You are still Ozunu.

657
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:58,055
Come. Beg your father for forgiveness.

658
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,400
Ah!

659
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,334
Your heart is weak.

660
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,612
Raizo!

661
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:33,484
All this loss, this waste...

662
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:38,989
...because you put yourself
before your family.

663
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:43,660
This is not my family.

664
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:48,999
You are not my father.

665
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:52,503
And the breath I take after I kill you...

666
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:54,963
...will be the first breath of my life.

667
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:06,535
Ah!

668
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,510
- Mika, run!
- Where is he?

669
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:25,179
Where is he?

670
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,097
Get away!

671
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:29,099
Mika!

672
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:31,810
No!

673
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,276
Most children are disappointments...

674
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:43,238
...not worth the effort to raise.

675
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:25,739
Ah!

676
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,984
Mika.

677
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,804
Jesus Christ, what happened?

678
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:32,681
She saved my life.

679
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:36,727
Medic!

680
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:40,147
Medic!

681
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:47,654
She'll be all right.

682
01:28:48,781 --> 01:28:50,532
Her heart is special.

683
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,578
I need a medic here now!

684
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:04,212
- Is she gonna be all right?
- I don't understand.

685
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,674
She's got a hole
right through her heart, but--

686
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,177
My heart is over here.

687
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:09,611
Come with me.
