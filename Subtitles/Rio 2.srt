00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:07,765
I'm just not inspired.

327
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,475
Carnival is
right around the corner

328
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
and our reputations
are on the line.

329
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,437
Copy that. We need something
that can make us wiggle.

330
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,914
Something that'll
make us jiggle.

331
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,148
We need something that pops.

332
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,608
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!

333
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,652
You know what "pop" is
backwards? Pop!

It's okay, Luiz.
Good to see you, too. Ugh.

337
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,746
Listen, Blu, we are
looking for a singer,

338
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,473
a dancer, the whole package.

339
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,667
Yeah, and you're more
of a mumbler-shuffler.

340
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,268
You catch my drift?

341
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,437
Oh. No, no, no, no, no,
I'm not here to audition.

342
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:39,838
Uh, I've got news.

343
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:42,800
I am going to the Amazon.

344
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,301
Yay.

345
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:48,264
The Amazon?
Wow, that's wild.

346
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,016
Yeah, yeah, Jewel thinks
it'll be good for us.

347
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,309
Uh, how wild?

348
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,602
Real wild.

349
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:56,163
They got mosquitoes that suck
your blood like Slurpees.

...eat flesh.

355
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,507
Oh, great, that sounds
really nice. I'm not going.

357
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,843
Blu, you have nothing
to worry about.

358
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,996
All those stories
are highly exaggerated.

359
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,831
You think so?
Of course!

360
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,850
If this is important
to Jewel, just do it.

361
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,979
Happy wife, happy life.
Remember that.

362
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,006
Okay, yeah, you're right.

363
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,816
You know,
a little family vacation

364
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,009
might actually be fun.

365
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,552
Plus, it's not like
it's forever.

366

That's the spirit.

Yeah. Okay.

Hey, Dad, look at this.

00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,187
Did you know
the Amazon has snakes

383
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,380
that can swallow you whole?

384
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,257
Actually, Bia, all those stories

385
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,859
are highly exaggerated.

386
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,235

Yeah.

00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,371
Linda gave it to me.
I need it for the GPS.

Oh, where's the GPS?

Enough with that GPS, really.

1470
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:40,704
The whole tribe's gathering
to watch the sunset. Come on.

1471
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,156
Oh, no, no. Hang on.
No, I just found

1472
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:43,636
Linda and Tulio's
coordinates. Hmm.

1473
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:45,321
They are just on
the other side of the grove.

1474
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:46,781
Look, they're really close.

1475
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:48,324
Oh.
Yeah.

1476
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:50,284
Now, I know your dad
doesn't totally trust humans

1477
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,620
but I'm sure if he met them,
he would change his mind.

1478
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:54,247
They can help keep
this place safe.

1479
01:02:54,272 --> 01:02:55,456
Yeah, Blu...

1480
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:57,358
My dad knows what he's doing.

1481
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:00,628
And can't you just
forget Linda and Tulio

1482
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:02,655
for one minute
and enjoy a sunset?

1483

01:03:08,536 --> 01:03:12,582
You know, maybe some places
shouldn't be found.

1487
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,976
Maybe they should
just be left alone.

She ate a bug. A bug!

1491
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:23,676
Blu, Blu, Blu! Calm down.

1492
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,528
Calm down? We had a plan.

1493
01:03:25,553 --> 01:03:27,763
Help Linda and Tulio find
the flock and get home.

1494
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,031
But when I mentioned it to her,

1495
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:30,176
she completely shut me down.

1496
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,410
Oh! Oh, oh, oh...
And her father?

1497
01:03:32,435 --> 01:03:33,911
Mmm, total nut job.

1498
01:03:33,936 --> 01:03:35,705
He's got this weird
thing about humans.

1499
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,957
He's got this weird
thing about humans!

1500
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:39,942
He loves them. He's a pet!

1501
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:41,752
A bet?

1502
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,029
He called me a pet.

1503
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:45,548
I can't believe he used
the P word to my face.

1504
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:47,341
It's like he thinks
I'm the enemy or something.

1505
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:50,720
He's not one of us, Roberto.
Keep an eye on him.

1506
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:53,181
Oh, and that Roberto?
He is always watching.

1507
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:55,141
He is always
hovering around Jewel.

1508
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:56,851
He is always singing something.

1509
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,085
I can't compete with that.

1510

You gotta bird up, bird!

You gotta emancipate yourself
from domestication.

1512
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:03,674
Try to see this place
through her eyes.

1513
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:06,527
Taste the flavors she's tasting.

1514
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:08,154
Ooh, so I should eat a bug?

1515
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:09,697
Ew, that's just nasty,
thinking about it.

1516
01:04:09,722 --> 01:04:11,265
Glitter. Where
is my glitter?

1517
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:12,992
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1518
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:15,453
I don't want apologies.
I want glitter.

1519

absolutely essential...
