The Ministry of Health, Labor

that these deaths may have been
caused by an unknown pathogen.

are all criminals or suspects...

it is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.

He's the talk of the net.

73
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,544
I think it's very likely that Kira exists.

74
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,383
He definitely exists.

75
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,289
They're all criminals, right?

76
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:09,124
I think it's way too extreme.

77
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,426
Criminals should die anyway.

78
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:15,423
Kill my parents, too.
Just kidding!

79
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,671
We interrupt our program
for this news.

80

The suspect who broke into
a consumer finance company in Tokyo...

81
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,441
has been identified.

82
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,007
His name is Hiromichi Imaizumi,
age 45.

83
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,579
The police say
that he is deeply in debt...

84
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,718
which could be the motive for
this armed robbery.

85
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,786
We give you live report
from the scene.

Three employees have been killed,
and five hostages remain.

89
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,639
We can hear the suspect shouting.

90
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:07,051
Five hours have passed since
the holdup began, but still no sign of...

91
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,953
I see people coming out.

92
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,221
A riot squad is
entering the building.

93
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,129
The suspect is still inside.

94
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,029
The hostages are coming out.
They're all safe!

95
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,472
We've just received news
that the suspect is dead.

96
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,579
According to the employees
held hostage...

97
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:42,987
Imaizumi suddenly
clutched his chest and collapsed.

98
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,115
Another mysterious death.

99
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,352
Is that it?

100
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,327
I can't think of anything else.

101
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,696
It's Kira. He did it.

102
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,896
Unbelievable!

103
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,335
Here.

104
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,964
Up the middle.

105
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,680
Yeah!

106
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,064
Excellent!

107
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,125
Show off.

108
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,638
It's your fault.

109
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,066
You're impossible.

110
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,009
You thief.

111
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,516
Future Superintendent, betting?

112
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,817
I'll buy you lunch.

113
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,756
That money's not clean.

114
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,419
I worked hard for it.

115
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,622
I wanted to celebrate.

116
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,494
Celebrate what?

117
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,862
The notice board.

118
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,628
You've passed the Bar Exam.

119
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:48,280
I'm the one who wanted
to be a district attorney.

120
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,273
You don't have to rush it, Shiori.

121
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,515
I just want to catch up with you.

122
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,317
I support Kira.

123
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,914
He's our savior.

124
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,224
But he just ignores civil rights
and false charges.

125
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,093
I can't approve of him.

126
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,364
Does studying law help?

127
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,699
Kira helps.

128
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,465
Hear hear!

129
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,398
Let's do a research on Kira.

130
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,275
They're all talking about Kira.

131
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,774
He's the god of justice.

132
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,841
That sounds too arrogant.

133
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,648
Oh really?

134
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,588
All criminals should be
punished by the law.

135
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:35,287
I might do the same
if I had his special powers.

136
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,988
Never.

137
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,796
You have your own way of
changing the world with law.

138
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,701
The law has its limits.

139
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,069
There are limits to everything.

140
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:55,004
Last month, I hacked into the database
of the Police Agency.

141
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,481
I needed to find out...

142
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,979
whether the criminals were
receiving adequate punishment.

143
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:17,669
But what I saw was the limit
to the justice I believed in.

144
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,837
This can't be...

145
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,105
"Wanted"

146
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,270
"Case Dropped"

147
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,576
"Unsolved"

148
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:37,278
Many criminals were
never captured for some reason.

149
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,086
The secret data showed
they were free from punishment.

150
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:44,353
"Takuo Shibuimaru"

151
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,296
"Case Dropped"

152
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:51,668
We were kept in the dark about that
to avoid confusion.

153
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,834
Is that really... possible?

154
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,866
I couldn't believe it, either.

155
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:03,508
A MONTH AGO
That's why I needed to
see for myself.

156
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,797
You got away with murder.

157
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,733
Is that fair?

158
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:26,704
I get carried away sometimes.

159
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,764
And then...

160
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,800
I hear this voice.

161
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,571
What does it say?

162
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,082
"Kill him!"

163
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,621
Just kidding.

164
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,625
You've taken years off my life.

165
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,964
Did you hear it?

166
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,095
The cry of the parent whose kid I killed
when they heard the verdict.

167
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,403
"Bring back my child!"

168
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,884
What're you looking at?

169
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,514
A relative of the kid?

170
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,390
This reminds me.

171
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,633
How it felt as the knife
slipped into the flesh...

172
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,869
and cut through his heart.

173
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:42,241
Why am I here?

174
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,841
I don't remember.

175
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,847
No one can put me behind bars.

176
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,062
Why did you go there?

177
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,437
It's dangerous.

178
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:13,002
Shiori, do you still
disapprove of Kira?

179
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:18,244
Do you honestly believe
they'll be punished by the law?

180
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,057
I will not tell her the rest.

181
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,357
No one will know my secret.

"Whoever's name is written on

184
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:30,518
The trial of the high school girl
murder case was held today.

185
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:35,721
The alleged killer, Kaonuma
showed no sign of remorse...

186
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,754
making the victim's family
even angrier.

187
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:49,196
Yosuke Kaonuma allegedly kidnapped
Tae Taeyama in Nagano...

188
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:49,969
and dragged her into a public toilet
where he stabbed her to death.

189
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,639
"KAONUMA"

190
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:03,751
He sent a letter to the papers
admitting his deeds.

191
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:08,954
The police are searching thoroughly
for other charges.

192
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,033
Don't forget your handkerchief.

193
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,101
Got it.

194
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,874
Then off you go.

You're up at last.
I envy college students.

196
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,646
Be careful of strangers.

197
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,450
I will. Bye.

198
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,922
Bye.

199
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,091
Light, hurry and eat up your breakfast.

200
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,596

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,137

Are you alright?

209
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,408
Help!

210
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,609
Hey!

211
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,880
What's wrong?

212
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,727
Wake up.

213
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:03,758
Takuo!

214
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,497
He's dead.

215
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,506
What's happening?

216
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,472
Shit!

217
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,523
Glad you like it.

218
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,179
What's the matter?

219
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,621
Can't you believe your eyes?

220
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:14,834
So, the god of death pays me a visit.

221
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,536
I dropped the notebook.

222
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,813
Are you taking it away from me?

223
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,981
Finders keepers. It's all yours.

224
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:39,128
Do I have to give you my life
in return?

225
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:52,342
Don't worry. If you don't want it
pass it on to someone else.

226
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:57,679
In which case, I'll erase
your memory of the "Death Note".

227
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,383
Is that all?

228
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:10,353
You may experience agony and fear
that only the user will come to know.

229
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:14,695
Well, that might not concern you.

230
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:29,841
Can other people... see you, too?

231
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:36,445
Only the people
who touch the "Death Note".

232
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,080
Tell me your name.

233
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,489
Curious?

234
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,622
Call me "Ryuk".

235
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,595
Ryuk...

236
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,535
FOUR MONTHS LATER
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

237
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,575
It's impossible.
We can't make this case.

238
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:15,190
The victims are criminals and
are scattered all over the world.

239
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,196
We see no connection whatsoever.

240
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,458
Chief.

241
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:24,458
This may be caused by
some unknown virus after all.

242
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,303
Want to throw it over to
the Ministry of Health?

243
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:35,136
I'm convinced
that this is a massacre.

244
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,675
I will not tolerate it;
the way he carries out his crimes.

245
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,585
We must get the bastard.

246
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:49,220
We're with you all the way, Chief.

247
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:53,362
I have to see the Commissioner.

248
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,097
THE NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

249
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,675
I'm here, Sir.

250
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:16,219
Matsubara, when did you come back?

251
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,551
Yesterday.

252
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:23,152
The ICPO have concluded
that the culprit is in Japan.

253
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,493
How did they conclude that?

254
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,398
The first death occurred in Japan.

255
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,393
So the culprit must be here.
That's what "L" says.

256
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,928
"L"?

257
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,532
Oh him.

258
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:43,810
He's cracked many unsolved cases
all over the world.

259
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:48,313
He's our last chance.

260
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,519
Watari.

261
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:02,324
We can contact "L"
only through Watari.

262
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:07,464
I've been asked to present
this message from "L".

263
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:22,142
Hello everyone. I am L.

264
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:28,893
The unexplainable deaths that
have occurred around the world...

265
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:36,163
is most likely caused by a single genius;
a slaughter by a vicious human being.

266
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:47,310
This data shows the deaths in Asia
caused by the Micrwa virus...

267
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:54,183
along with the distinctions of sex
age and nationality of the deceased.

268
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,852
A distribution chart.

269
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:03,885
A natural occurrence would show
a gentle slope like this.

270
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,897
Now, this is the chart of
the unexplainable deaths.

271
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,899
I see.

272
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:20,571
Are you suggesting that
the deaths are unnatural?

273
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,102
Yes.

274
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,116
I will call the culprit,
"Kira" for now.

275
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:30,679
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that he did it alone.

276
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:38,651
This shows the number of people
and the success rates of the crime.

277
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:43,530
Group crimes are much less
successful.

278
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:51,133
If we assume
that this is a group crime...

279
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:58,207
he would have to have at least
80 accomplices around the world.

280
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:05,554
With 80 accomplices,
the success rate would drop enormously.

281
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:11,460
This indicates that it is being done
by an individual.

282
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:17,435
Then how do you explain
all the killings at the same time?

283
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,699
Your theory won't work.

284
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:27,577
I could narrow the profile down and
prove to you, how he executes his plan.

285
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,670
How?

286
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,109
This is all for now.
Until then, good-bye.

287
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:46,628
You don't agree with him?

288
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:51,568
It's not a matter of agreeing,
we have no other choice.

289
00:27:56,074 --> 00:28:01,535
I will make Yagami the leader of
the Investigation Team.

290
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,915
Yes, Sir.

291
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,054
"Kira"

292
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,687
Look Ryuk.

293
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:21,790
They're all talking about him
on the net.

294
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:27,198
The world can feel
that justice indeed exists.

295
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,172
"Kira", that's me.

296
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,112
Feeling good, huh?

297
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:42,950
They all know that the bad guys
are being eliminated.

298
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:50,359
The good will rejoice
and the bad will tremble in fear.

299
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,023
History is about to change.

300
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:58,399
"Death Note" will help make
a crime-free world.

301
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,133
The future is in my hands.

302
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:05,040
What a hero!

303
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:16,781
They've sent me news about Kira.

304
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,016
"A news flash"

305
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:35,939
We bring you live report...

306
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,839
Who's he?

307
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:43,405
From the International
Criminal Police Organization.

308
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:51,683
"My name is Lind L. Tailor,
known as L."

309
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:58,788
"I have been asked by the ICPO
to help find the serial killer."

310
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,700
"This is one of the most
brutal crimes in history."

311
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:11,471
"The mastermind behind this,
known as Kira..."

312
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:16,742
"has an extraordinary ego,
and is a vile and immature criminal."

313
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:20,547
"Immature" is right.

314
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:29,186
"I, L will assure you that
Kira will be arrested at all cost."

315
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,319
Be my guest.

316
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:34,991
"Kira, I can easily read
your moves..."

317
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,593
"because of your immaturity."

318
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,162
"You are not allowed
to exist in this world."

319
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:47,304
"You are far lower than
the criminals you've eliminated."

320
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,745
You are, too.

321
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,246
I'll let the world know.

322
00:30:54,485 --> 00:31:00,390
"However, there are many
who support Kira."

323
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:04,828
"He has taken the law
into his hands."

324
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:10,497
It's a pity I can't play games
with you anymore.

325
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:17,705
"But if we allow people
to be judged this way..."

326
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:24,113
"our civilization will revert to
a world of brutality."

327
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,753
40 seconds...

328
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,501
Call an ambulance!

329
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,784
Impressive.

330
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:13,695
So, Kira...

331
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,824
you can kill people
without lifting a finger.

332
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,405
Hear this, Kira.

333
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:27,241
The man you've just killed
is a convict on death row.

334
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,716
It was hidden from the media, and
his arrest was strictly confidential.

335
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:38,785
We made him appear as me.

336
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,523
The real L is still alive.

337
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,197
Kill me if you dare!

338
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,772
You can't, can you?

339
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,342
And Kira...

340
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,781
I have new piece of information.

341
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,955
You are now around Tokyo area.

342
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:18,086
We've made you think it was worldwide

343
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,326
but the broadcast was restricted.

344
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,703
The first crime occurred in Japan,
so we knew you were here somewhere.

345
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:34,702
But now, we're sure.

346
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,213
Awesome!

347
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,340
This isn't a game!

348
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,907
Watch your mouth.

349
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,643
Sorry.

350
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:49,924
The police are right behind you.

351
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:54,421
Kira.

352
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,229
We will solve every mystery
and hunt you down without fail.

353
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:01,136
Your penalty is death!

354
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,007
My penalty?

355
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,308
I am justice!

356
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:17,778
No, I am justice.

357
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,385
Savior of the weak
and god of the new world.

358
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:26,761
The ones who disobey are evil.

359
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:32,762
You kill in the name of justice.
Humans are fun!

360
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:39,935
I've gotta see who wins.

361
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,776
Right.

362
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,247
Chief, I've confirmed.

363
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:52,184
The fake L on TV has actually died.

364
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:58,127
L actually narrowed the culprit down.

365
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:02,428
They've sacrificed the life of a convict.

366
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,861
That makes them no different
from Kira.

367
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,475
"L Vs Kira"

368
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,414
"Convict Killed On Air"

369
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,642
"Kira, the Killer"

370
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,281
"A Full Investigation"

371
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,655
"Detective L Vs Kira"

"Heart Attack, Lind L. Tailor"

00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,263
"Kira Kills Convict"

374
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,096
At first I thought it was
"Candid Camera".

375
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,332
What do you think of Kira?

376
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,202
He should leave it to the police.

377
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,105
And the court.

378
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,135
What?

379
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,804
Did you see the news?

380
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,642
Oh that.

381
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,204
Come in.

382
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,580
Sayu!

383
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,455
They let a person die on TV.

384
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,863
I thought it was a dirty trick
using a convict.

385
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,964
I knew you'd be on Kira's side.

386
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,798
He's far better than L.

387
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:21,605
Kira is a murderer.
What he's doing isn't justice.

388
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,376
But the crime rate is dropping.

389
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,906
He's just holding us down with fear.

390
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,751
Think of it as a revolution.

391
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,019
Revolutions have betrayed us.

392
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:39,052
What a fighter!

393
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,358
Shut up.

394
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,729
Huh?

395
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,327
Nothing. Let's go outside.

396
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,391
Wanna try it, too?

397
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,300
Why not.

398
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:32,311
I can't... with people around.

399
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,315
Not unless it were our last kiss.

400
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:45,221
What if she were to discover
that you are Kira?

401
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:51,167
I believe Shiori would understand
someday.

402
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,800
L, here's a report from
the Investigation Team.

403
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,312
Please begin.

404
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:09,847
This chart as requested by L,
shows the victims' times of deaths.

405
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,648
I see nothing special here.

406
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:18,321
Have you heard of?
The Law of Large Numbers?

407
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,330
Large Numbers?

408
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:26,962
It's a theorem Bernoulli created
in observing nature.

409
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,939
Is L watching this?

410
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,706
It's connected to L's computer.

411
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:44,018
We split this seemingly random data
into seven sections.

412
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,455
Is L doing that?

413
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,219
I guess.

414
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,296
What is that?

415
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,362
It looks familiar.

416
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,941
A timetable.

417
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,239
A college students' schedule.

418
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,477
Mondays start from third period.

419
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,484
Tuesdays have early starts.

420
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:24,656
College student Kira,
who doesn't kill during class.

421
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,525
You're in a good mood.

422
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,834
Huh, am I?

423
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,137
You've promised to tell me
how things are going with Shiori.

424
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,938
No, I haven't.

425
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,681
I'm curious, too.
What's going on with you and her?

426
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,251
Father's home.

427
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,719
Don't run away from me!

428
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:52,551
You're back.

429
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,579
Welcome home.

430
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,091
Light and Shiori are...

431
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,991
Blabbermouth.

432
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,621
What about him?

433
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,633
Here you are.

434
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,694
It's nice drinking at home.

435
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,332
I knew you were exhausted.

436
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,208
Why?

437
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,874
You're in charge of Kira's case.

438
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,350
Why would I be?

439
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,218
Seems like there's a lot on your mind.

440
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:29,089
Father, I want to help you.

441
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,321
Light.

442
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:35,662
I know you've helped us
several times before.

443
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,999
You have a sharp mind.

444
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,905
And I'm very proud of you.

445
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,774
I'm proud, too.

446
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,506
That's right.

447
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:56,043
But this time, we're dealing with
a dangerous killer.

448
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:03,283
He's a devil that kills
without doing anything himself.

449
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,127
I can't have you involved.

450
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,029
But I could...

451
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,695
No.

452
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,775
This is my case.

453
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:24,244
Your time will come
5 or 10 years from now.

454
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:29,116
Save your strength for then.

455
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,448
Don't rush it.

456
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,824
I understand.

457
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,326
I'll go study.

458
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,658
For 10 years from now.

459
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,195
Father.

460
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:50,137
But if something were to
happen to you...

461
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:55,339
I'd send Kira to the gallows.

462
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:16,589
Can you believe that your father
was in charge of the case?

463
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,202
Police's database?

464
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:30,407
This is today's report on
the investigation.

465
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,842
They know Kira is a student.

466
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:47,061
24 criminals are dying per day!

467
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:50,294
Precisely one per hour.

468
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,268
What does this mean?

469
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,238
Kira isn't a student after all

470
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:59,431
That's not what he's telling us.

471
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,501
Then what?

472
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,912
He can manipulate the times of death.

473
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:09,249
Manipulate the times of death?

474
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,686
And one more thing.

475
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:16,352
Our information has been
leaking out to Kira.

476
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:23,529
It was three days ago
that we discovered he was a student.

477
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:27,025
From the next day,
the time became irregular.

478
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,766
Which means...

479
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:35,678
Kira is telling the police
that he is amongst us.

480
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:46,754
Don't you think it's a quiet afternoon
for a revolution?

481
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:54,031
The crime rate is dropping
thanks to Kira.

482
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:59,267
We're getting closer to
a crime-free world.

483
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,673
Who could have imagined
such a future was possible?

484
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,842
What's the matter, Ryuk?
Tired of apples?

485
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,688
There's no one...

486
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,277
I'm being followed. Since when?

487
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,040
The day before yesterday.

488
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,945
Why didn't you tell me?

489
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:49,180
I'm not on your side nor L's.

490
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,353
Police, right?

491
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:57,918
No, they can't be onto me yet.

492
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,054
Who can he be?

493
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:22,179
Light.

494
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,245
We, gods of death survive on
the years of human lives.

495
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,847
What do you mean?

496
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:32,385
People who die because of the book,
leave behind the years...

497
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:37,526
You take away the years
they were supposed to live, right?

498
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:43,498
How do you think
we've come to know your names?

499
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,877
You can see them.

500
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:53,345
Uh-huh.

501
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,544
Your names and the years you'll live.

502
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,354
You can see the years I have left

503
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,755
and his name, too?

504
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,689
Don't you want to see like me?

505
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,461
I might.

506
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:16,434
What do I give you in return?

507
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:20,136
Half the years of your life.

508
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,210
No way.

509
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:26,774
Then how will you get his name?

510
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,627
Chief, three others died in jail.

511
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,696
Shirami cut his fingers

512
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,674
and drew a large star on the wall.

513
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:57,043
Yadanaka left a suicide note.

514
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,915
And Tobe escaped from his cell
and ran into the lavatory...

515
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,750
where he died of heart attack.

516
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:12,391
Mr. Yagami.

517
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,796
Tell the press that it was
nothing more than a heart attack.

518
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,394
Why?

519
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:23,463
It seems like Kira is trying to
test something with these deaths.

520
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,722
See?

521
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:44,318
It's all here; the information
they didn't give in their statement.

522
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:50,658
The killings were carried out
just as I'd written.

523
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,032
What a surprise!

524
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:58,839
Today in Kanagawa?
at 2:40 in the afternoon...

525
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:03,711
here was a robbery at Teikai Bank
which left three employees dead.

526
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:07,239
Three men disappeared with
5 million yen.

527
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:12,813
Later, two of them were captured,
but one is still on the run.

528
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:18,183
He is Kiichiro Osoreda, age 36.

529
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,628
His past convictions were...

530
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,154
Ryuk.

531
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,030
Huh?

532
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:28,902
People who touch the "Death Note"
can see you, right?

533
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,566
So what?

534
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,683
The bus is starting.

535
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,030
The bus is a nice change.

536
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:43,568
There's someone following me
for the past three days.

537
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,452
Why are you following me?

538
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,689
Are you someone from
the inquiry agency?

539
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,021
I don't know
what you're talking about.

540
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,669
What is this?

541
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,865
If you wanna live, do as I say.

542
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,498
Shut up! Be quiet!

543
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,271
Light...

544
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,517
Call the company.

545
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:02,691
This is Sasaki on bus 124.

546
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,526
This bus is mine!

547
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,963
If you want the hostages alive,
get me 100 million.

548
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,966
"I'll find a chance and grab him."

549
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,812
Don't. It's too risky.

550
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,682
You must leave it to me.

551
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:33,917
How could I trust you?
I am the son of a cop.

552
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,619
Let me go.

553
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,393
Wait.

554
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,162
I can save you from him.

555
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:50,105
How will I know
that you're not an accomplice?

556
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,104
Accomplice?

557
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:57,239
In most cases, they team up
and one of them works as a lookout.

558
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,582
Alright

559
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,521
The FBI?

560
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:15,725
His name... Raye Iwamatsu.

561
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,332
Hey!

562
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,967
What're you up to?

563
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:38,281
Kid, you have some nerve.

564
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:44,750
What in the hell are you?

565
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:49,128
Can you see me?

566
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,135
Where did you come from?

567
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:59,266
I see. A piece of the "Death Note".

568
00:52:59,309 --> 00:52:59,832
You monster!

569
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,207
Get down!

570
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,848
Too bad.

571
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:14,948
I'm the god of death
so I don't die easily.

572
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,801
Stop!

573
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,496
Stop the bus!

574
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,490
Kiichiro Osoreda, car accident.

575
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,897
On March 29th, 2006...

576
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:04,700
he gets on the 10:12 Kyonan bus
bound for the Okukawa Garage.

577
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:12,580
He carries a gun with 8 bullets,
and tries to rob the bus...

578
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:20,780
but sees a horrifying phantom
and starts to fire at it.

579
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:25,887
With no bullets left,
he hurries off the bus and...

580
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,989
You.

581
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,796
If you have questions,
come to me directly.

582
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,429
I won't run or hide.

583
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:35,563
Let's go.

584
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,068
Your mother's coming.

585
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,804
And the busjacker?

586
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,573
Died instantly.

587
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:21,448
Serves him right.
The police are all over the place.

588
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,515
We should...

589
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,519
It's okay.

590
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,650
I've already told the police
about what we saw.

591
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:35,928
So lie down and rest.

592
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,827
Promise me you'll never
do it again.

593
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:47,206
If something were to happen to you,
I don't know what I'd do.

594
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,070
Shiori...

595
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,667
You're back.

596
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,342
Hi.

597
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,284
Is something the matter?

598
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,911
It's nothing.

599
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:46,730
"He which made them at the beginning
made them male and female."

600
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:53,403
"A man shall leave father and mother,
and cleave to his wife."

601
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:59,713
"And they twain shall be one flesh."

602
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,547
The Bible.

603
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:09,484
When are we going to church
to meet with the priest?

604
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,619
Is Saturday okay?

605
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,288
Fine.

606
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:19,429
Raye, you must be very careful.
You're dealing with Kira.

607
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:26,064
Who used to go on
dangerous missions for L?

608
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,839
You've changed me.

609
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,508
The new victim left a note.

610
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,094
"L, DID YOU KNOW?"

611
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:57,672
"THE GOD OF DEATH, EATS..."

612
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,675
"NOTHING BUT APPLES"!

613
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,276
Sorry.

614
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:12,915
There can't be only one FBI agent.

615
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:17,120
Suspecting that Kira was someone
within the authority...

616
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,097
L must have had the FBI
secretly follow me.

617
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:27,569
That would mean he's not
the only agent in Japan.

618
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,440
If I kill him, I'll be suspected.

619
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:41,014
But what if all the FBI agents
on this case were to die?

620
00:58:42,111 --> 00:58:44,944
Hey, Light.

621
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,881
The FBI aren't criminals.

622
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,554
Killing them anyway?

623
00:58:57,226 --> 00:59:00,093
"Minami-Aoyama Catholic Church"

624
00:59:06,602 --> 00:59:07,694
Raye.

625
00:59:07,736 --> 00:59:10,296
I'm sorry, Naomi.

626
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:13,467
I just got a call.
I'll join you later.

627
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:16,171
But Father made time for us.

628
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:17,610
Patch things up for me.

629
01:00:53,475 --> 01:01:00,108
"Raye Iwamatsu. I am Kira.
Use the transceiver inside."

630
01:01:00,149 --> 01:01:03,949
"I will talk to you directly."

631
01:01:21,036 --> 01:01:23,766
Hello, I am Kira.

632
01:01:24,773 --> 01:01:27,298
I am watching your every move.

633
01:01:28,077 --> 01:01:30,807
Do not look around. Face forward.

634
01:01:32,414 --> 01:01:35,850
Remember, I can always kill you.

635
01:01:40,055 --> 01:01:42,888
How will I know you're not a fake?

636
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:46,355
I'll show you.
See the man sitting next to you

637
01:01:46,395 --> 01:01:51,526
His name is Taruhito Ozaki,
arrested for rape two years ago.

638
01:01:51,567 --> 01:02:00,202
But the victims feared revenge,
and did not press charges against him.

639
01:02:00,242 --> 01:02:05,771
He deserves to be punished.

640
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:10,448
Taruhito Ozaki heart attack

641
01:02:10,486 --> 01:02:13,284
Taruhito Ozaki sits on
the right hand side of the train.

642
01:02:13,322 --> 01:02:16,086
After it leaves Akasakabashi Station,

643
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:21,085
he will die quietly from a heart attack.

644
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:25,261
Stay calm.

645
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:32,804
Now quietly, see if he's dead and
make him look like he's sleeping.

646
01:02:55,931 --> 01:02:59,298
Do you believe I'm Kira now?
You killed him just to prove that?

647
01:03:00,302 --> 01:03:03,829
Just answer my questions.

648
01:03:03,872 --> 01:03:11,938
Tell me how many people from the FBI
are here in Japan.

649
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:20,021
If you refuse, I'll start killing
the passengers one by one.

650
01:03:29,198 --> 01:03:34,295
There are 11 people besides myself.

651
01:03:36,872 --> 01:03:40,399
Do you know
all their names and faces?

652
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,468
No.

653
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,875
I'm telling you the truth.

654
01:03:49,384 --> 01:03:56,256
But surely, you must know
who your leader is, don't you?

655
01:03:57,726 --> 01:03:59,421
I do.

656
01:03:59,928 --> 01:04:03,489
You'll find five pieces of paper.

657
01:04:11,273 --> 01:04:17,041
Write down the name of your leader
inside the blank of the first page.

658
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:19,240
Accurately.

659
01:04:19,281 --> 01:04:23,217
If you make it up,
I'll know immediately.

660
01:04:23,252 --> 01:04:25,743
I wouldn't dare if I were you.

661
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:50,144
Cut on the computer.

662
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:55,115
You'll soon get all 12 IDs of
the FBI from your leader.

663
01:04:55,584 --> 01:04:57,211
"Free Access Available"

664
01:05:28,817 --> 01:05:30,512
I've got it.

665
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:33,479
Open it.

666
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:46,732
Look at the pictures of the agents
attached to their IDs...

667
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:52,172
and fill in their names accurately
inside the rest of the blanks.

668
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:44,123
Done.

669
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,159
Now, put them back in the envelope,
and place it on the rack.

670
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:21,490
Get off at Shinagawa Park Station.

671
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:25,099
And leave the transceiver behind.

672
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,390
Raye.

673
01:08:03,939 --> 01:08:05,429
Naomi?

674
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:31,589
Raye!

675
01:08:34,035 --> 01:08:36,094
Raye...

676
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:39,097
Raye!

677
01:09:51,346 --> 01:09:54,713
Raye Iwamatsu, heart attack.

678
01:09:57,218 --> 01:10:03,418
Cancels all schedule, and
rides the train from Akasakabashi.

679
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:07,121
Gets on the 10:14 train

680
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,790
from the last door of the fourth car.

681
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:13,395
He takes the manila envelope...

682
01:10:15,604 --> 01:10:19,199
and dies three seconds after
getting off.

683
01:10:27,549 --> 01:10:29,449
Five in Tokyo, three in Kanagawa,

684
01:10:29,484 --> 01:10:31,509
and four others.

685
01:10:31,553 --> 01:10:34,317
They all died of heart attacks.

686
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:40,818
Their leader in Washington is said
to have died at the same hour.

687
01:10:41,229 --> 01:10:43,220
FBI agents?

688
01:10:43,264 --> 01:10:50,693
They were instructed by L
to secretly investigate the case.

689
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:54,573
By L? Did you know about this?

690
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:57,840
It's all out of the blue.

691
01:11:01,082 --> 01:11:03,846
"A Report on FBI Activities"

692
01:11:04,452 --> 01:11:09,446
The FBI agents that were
investigating the case died.

693
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:13,622
All heart attacks.

694
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:20,334
Kira is now killing people
besides criminals.

695
01:11:23,438 --> 01:11:28,307
It is possible that
we may all become targets.

696
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:30,237
You should think carefully...

697
01:11:30,278 --> 01:11:37,377
about your families
and your loved ones.

698
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:43,452
You are free to drop out of
this investigation.

699
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:49,926
I guarantee that you will not
be demoted or punished for doing so.

700
01:11:50,632 --> 01:11:56,867
Those of you who are not afraid to
risk everything can stay.

701
01:11:59,574 --> 01:12:06,343
Lastly, I thank those
who fought with us till this day.

702
01:12:56,397 --> 01:12:59,127
There's only six of us.

703
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:02,432
Watari and I are with you.

704
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:07,100
I have faith in people who have
a strong sense of justice.

705
01:13:07,142 --> 01:13:09,303
L.

706
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:13,974
I'm sorry but
it's getting hard to trust you.

707
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:19,851
You give us orders from a safe place,
keeping yourself hidden at all times.

708
01:13:19,888 --> 01:13:22,482
How can you expect us to trust you?

709
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:25,493
We can't have you working with us.

710
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:27,552
He's right.

711
01:13:27,595 --> 01:13:32,430
To tell the truth,
I've also had doubts about you.

712
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:37,603
You tend to take drastic measures.

713
01:13:40,775 --> 01:13:48,238
However, your cooperation is
essential to finding Kira.

714
01:13:48,283 --> 01:13:55,212
If you want to work with us,
why don't you show yourself?

715
01:13:57,492 --> 01:14:01,519
And then we could fight together.

716
01:14:02,297 --> 01:14:03,457
Fine.

717
01:14:03,498 --> 01:14:04,760
Watari.

718
01:14:11,706 --> 01:14:15,699
I will take you to L.

719
01:15:23,613 --> 01:15:26,207
How do you do, I'm L.

720
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,954
I am Yagami.

721
01:15:39,996 --> 01:15:40,621
Ukita.

722
01:15:40,663 --> 01:15:41,288
Aizawa.

723
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:41,887
Mogi.

724
01:15:41,931 --> 01:15:42,625
Sanami.

725
01:15:42,665 --> 01:15:43,359
Matsuda.

726
01:15:47,436 --> 01:15:49,097
Hey you!

727
01:15:49,138 --> 01:15:54,371
If I were Kira, you'd be dead by now.

728
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:56,207
What do you mean?

729
01:15:56,245 --> 01:15:58,338
From what we know so far...

730
01:15:58,381 --> 01:16:00,645
Kira needs the names and features

731
01:16:00,683 --> 01:16:02,844
of the targets in order to kill them.

732
01:16:02,885 --> 01:16:07,288
From now on, do not
give out your real names.

733
01:16:07,323 --> 01:16:11,726
As for myself, call me Ryuzaki.

734
01:16:13,329 --> 01:16:14,591
Alright.

735
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:23,333
Kira can also manipulate
one's behavior before death.

736
01:16:24,674 --> 01:16:31,307
The suicide notes written in jail
were probably Kira's experiment.

737
01:16:31,347 --> 01:16:32,644
Experiment?

738
01:16:32,682 --> 01:16:34,707
He tested them to see how accurately

739
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:38,743
he could kill the FBI agents.

740
01:16:38,788 --> 01:16:42,622
He's sent a message to me
through their suicide notes.

741
01:16:42,658 --> 01:16:44,922
Did Kira do that, too?

742
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,454
The agents died eight days after
this experiment.

743
01:16:49,498 --> 01:16:52,831
During that time, he somehow got

744
01:16:52,868 --> 01:16:56,531
the names from one particular agent.

745
01:16:56,972 --> 01:17:00,203
Kira is someone
within the authority...

746
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:03,678
marked by the FBI,
before the experiment.

747
01:17:03,713 --> 01:17:05,510
Exactly.

748
01:17:05,548 --> 01:17:08,949
That should be easy to narrow down.

749
01:17:08,984 --> 01:17:10,076
Sure.

750
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:18,722
Gathering from Kira's behavior,
he is very immature and hates to lose.

751
01:17:20,062 --> 01:17:21,962
Just like me.

752
01:17:22,565 --> 01:17:26,558
I've been losing up till now
but things are going to change.

753
01:17:26,602 --> 01:17:32,097
Let's win this together.

754
01:17:32,141 --> 01:17:33,938
Ryuzaki.

755
01:17:33,976 --> 01:17:39,573
This isn't a game,
this is an investigation.

756
01:17:39,615 --> 01:17:42,880
Our purpose is no different.

757
01:17:51,527 --> 01:17:56,055
"Busjacker Killed in Accident"

758
01:18:16,685 --> 01:18:21,213
"11 a.m. Kyonan Bus"

759
01:18:28,697 --> 01:18:32,428
"Investigation Closed"

760
01:18:43,245 --> 01:18:45,975
I've collected all the tapes.

761
01:18:48,784 --> 01:18:52,311
The ones from the security camera.

762
01:18:52,354 --> 01:18:53,844
Thanks for the trouble.

763
01:19:29,692 --> 01:19:31,125
This is him.

764
01:19:33,896 --> 01:19:35,761
Oh yes, he was sitting at the back.

765
01:19:35,798 --> 01:19:37,095
I remember.

766
01:19:37,132 --> 01:19:40,260
He was quarreling with a young man
when the robber came on the bus.

767
01:19:40,302 --> 01:19:42,668
What did this young man look like?

768
01:19:42,705 --> 01:19:48,769
Handsome.
Not that I have a thing for boys.

769
01:19:48,811 --> 01:19:54,716
Brave too. He didn't seem afraid
when the gun was pointed at him.

770
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,412
Was he questioned by the police?

771
01:19:57,453 --> 01:20:01,446
No. Actually, he disappeared.

772
01:20:03,025 --> 01:20:05,892
Maybe he didn't want to be involved, either.

773
01:20:07,396 --> 01:20:09,125
Here.

774
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:12,892
And this...

775
01:21:20,703 --> 01:21:23,900
You've narrowed down the list?

776
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:25,566
Yes.

777
01:21:25,607 --> 01:21:27,199
Who's on it?

778
01:21:41,623 --> 01:21:44,353
The Chief's and Deputy Chief's families.

779
01:21:45,127 --> 01:21:48,324
Why don't you explain?

780
01:21:50,032 --> 01:21:55,334
This is the moment of
Agent Iwamatsu's death.

781
01:21:55,371 --> 01:21:59,501
As you can see,
he is pointing towards the train.

782
01:22:00,342 --> 01:22:02,105
Someone was on it?

783
01:22:02,144 --> 01:22:04,237
Presumably Kira.

784
01:22:12,287 --> 01:22:13,948
Who is she?

785
01:22:13,989 --> 01:22:16,116
Iwamatsu's fiancé.

786
01:22:17,459 --> 01:22:23,591
She was a talented FBI agent
who used to work under me.

787
01:22:24,266 --> 01:22:31,035
She probably noticed something unusual
and decided to follow him.

788
01:22:31,073 --> 01:22:34,065
Let's contact her right away.

789
01:22:34,109 --> 01:22:37,670
She's disappeared since his death.

790
01:22:37,713 --> 01:22:41,877
He must have been onto somebody.

791
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:44,852
And we are one of them.

792
01:22:44,887 --> 01:22:49,085
With a probability of
less than three percent.

793
01:22:49,124 --> 01:22:50,557
Questioning us?

794
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:52,082
No.

795
01:22:52,127 --> 01:22:59,124
We'll set up cameras and bugs
in both your houses.

796
01:22:59,168 --> 01:23:03,002
We cannot allow
this kind of outrage!

797
01:23:03,038 --> 01:23:05,336
If this comes out, we're all fired.

798
01:23:05,374 --> 01:23:08,832
I thought we weren't afraid
to risk everything.

799
01:23:12,981 --> 01:23:15,916
Fine. Let's do it.

800
01:23:15,951 --> 01:23:17,145
Chief!

801
01:23:17,186 --> 01:23:20,883
Check for any blind spots,
and do it thoroughly.

802
01:23:20,923 --> 01:23:23,483
What about your wife and daughter?

803
01:23:23,525 --> 01:23:28,224
I'm aware!

804
01:23:28,263 --> 01:23:30,959
But we'll never clear ourselves
if we avoid this.

805
01:23:30,999 --> 01:23:37,700
We'll set the cameras and bugs for,
shall we say, seven days.

806
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:43,109
Why don't we have Chief
watch his own family then?

807
01:23:43,145 --> 01:23:44,942
Alright.

808
01:23:46,548 --> 01:23:50,211
Mr. Yagami and I will watch his house.

809
01:23:50,252 --> 01:23:54,120
Rest of you take turns
and watch Mr. Kitamura's.

810
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:20,141
This man...

811
01:24:20,182 --> 01:24:21,979
Recognize him?

812
01:24:23,485 --> 01:24:25,919
He was following Light.

813
01:24:26,989 --> 01:24:28,923
Something the matter?

814
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,187
He died.

815
01:24:36,231 --> 01:24:41,294
He was killed by Kira
while investigating the case.

816
01:24:46,575 --> 01:24:50,170
Hey, Light.

817
01:24:50,212 --> 01:24:52,180
Why are you scheduling deaths
for weeks ahead?

818
01:24:52,214 --> 01:24:59,382
So as not to be suspected, in case
I'm hospitalized or tied up somehow.

819
01:25:00,155 --> 01:25:02,214
You think of everything.

820
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:05,722
Welcome to my show...

821
01:25:05,761 --> 01:25:09,162
"Misamisa's Happy Sweets"

822
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:13,464
Here's what I'm making today.

823
01:25:14,203 --> 01:25:15,830
Can't wait!

824
01:25:15,871 --> 01:25:19,329
Fatten your friends with
croissant-pudding!

825
01:25:24,279 --> 01:25:25,871
What is it?

826
01:25:26,815 --> 01:25:28,442
Nothing.

827
01:25:33,255 --> 01:25:38,056
You can fatten your rival in love
as much as five kilos.

828
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:43,129
My rival would be?
the pop star, Ai Otsuka.

829
01:25:43,565 --> 01:25:49,197
But I ended up getting fat instead!

830
01:25:49,238 --> 01:25:51,297
Now who's the devil?

831
01:25:52,741 --> 01:25:55,938
Croissant-pudding completed.

832
01:25:55,978 --> 01:25:59,414
Let's make pigs out of our rivals in love!

833
01:25:59,448 --> 01:26:00,847
Excellent!

834
01:26:01,617 --> 01:26:04,677
Who do you respect the most?

835
01:26:06,722 --> 01:26:08,622
Kira.

836
01:26:08,657 --> 01:26:11,091
A follower of Kira, too?

837
01:26:11,126 --> 01:26:15,426
He's so cool being
the executioner and all.

838
01:26:15,464 --> 01:26:18,490
The youngsters should agree.

839
01:26:19,334 --> 01:26:24,203
Actually, Kira saved me.

840
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,433
What do you mean?

841
01:26:25,474 --> 01:26:29,240
Misa, I've told you
not to talk about Kira.

842
01:26:29,278 --> 01:26:31,337
Why can't I?

843
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:34,975
Please cut the bit about Kira.

844
01:26:35,851 --> 01:26:38,319
Where's my freedom?

845
01:26:40,088 --> 01:26:42,955
I can't ask about her private life?

846
01:26:42,991 --> 01:26:46,586
You can, but not on this subject.

847
01:26:46,628 --> 01:26:50,064
Everyone's talking about Kira.

848
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:53,896
Thank you all!

849
01:26:53,935 --> 01:26:56,426
Bye!

850
01:27:15,624 --> 01:27:17,057
Light.

851
01:27:27,569 --> 01:27:30,868
This is Ms. Maki.

852
01:27:30,906 --> 01:27:34,205
She wants to ask you something.

853
01:27:36,345 --> 01:27:37,869
How do you do?

854
01:27:37,913 --> 01:27:39,039
Hello.

855
01:27:40,115 --> 01:27:42,948
I'm doing an article on Kira's case.

856
01:27:42,984 --> 01:27:47,148
I've heard you met Raye Iwamatsu.

857
01:27:48,457 --> 01:27:52,723
Remember the man on the bus
from the FBI?

858
01:27:53,729 --> 01:27:55,253
Oh him.

859
01:27:55,297 --> 01:28:00,291
He was killed by Kira
while investigating the case.

860
01:28:00,335 --> 01:28:02,462
I didn't know.

861
01:28:02,504 --> 01:28:03,596
You didn't?

862
01:28:03,638 --> 01:28:08,302
He was the one following Light.

863
01:28:09,344 --> 01:28:11,335
That's right.

864
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:14,645
Because he suspected you were Kira.

865
01:28:14,683 --> 01:28:19,586
Are you trying to say I killed him?

866
01:28:19,621 --> 01:28:22,419
Kira can kill with a name.

867
01:28:22,457 --> 01:28:26,985
You've used the busjack to
find out Raye's name.

868
01:28:27,996 --> 01:28:30,624
That's funny.

869
01:28:30,665 --> 01:28:33,532
Did Raye die immediately afterwards?

870
01:28:33,568 --> 01:28:35,297
Three days later.

871
01:28:35,337 --> 01:28:42,766
If I were Kira, I would've killed him
as soon as I discovered his name.

872
01:28:42,811 --> 01:28:47,145
Light can't be Kira.

873
01:28:47,182 --> 01:28:49,309
You're wrong.

874
01:28:49,351 --> 01:28:51,546
And rude.

875
01:28:51,586 --> 01:28:53,747
I may sue you
so I'm putting down your words.

876
01:28:55,624 --> 01:28:58,616
Other agents died, too.

877
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:04,098
But if you killed Raye first,
you thought you would be suspected.

878
01:29:04,132 --> 01:29:07,192
That's why he wasn't killed
right away.

879
01:29:07,235 --> 01:29:09,135
Am I wrong?

880
01:29:09,171 --> 01:29:11,731
All the agents died?

881
01:29:11,773 --> 01:29:14,105
I never heard that on the news.

882
01:29:14,142 --> 01:29:16,076
It was kept a secret.

883
01:29:18,246 --> 01:29:20,976
You're making it up.

884
01:29:21,383 --> 01:29:24,784
I didn't know she was such a person.

885
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:26,913
On the subway...

886
01:29:26,955 --> 01:29:31,153
you somehow found out the names

887
01:29:31,193 --> 01:29:33,024
of the agents and killed them all.

888
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,863
This is a waste of time. Let's go.

889
01:29:46,074 --> 01:29:48,008
Light Yagami.

890
01:29:48,944 --> 01:29:54,814
You can't kill me.
I've given you my false name.

891
01:29:57,085 --> 01:29:59,246
Go away.

892
01:30:00,288 --> 01:30:02,756
Raye was my fiancé.

893
01:30:04,025 --> 01:30:09,895
I'll hunt Kira down and won't stop
till I put him behind bars.

894
01:30:12,534 --> 01:30:14,627
What was that?

895
01:30:14,669 --> 01:30:16,637
She's crazy.

896
01:30:17,939 --> 01:30:19,839
False name, huh?

897
01:30:28,216 --> 01:30:32,380
Another one's on your tail.

898
01:30:34,322 --> 01:30:37,689
Sure you don't want my eyes?

899
01:30:40,161 --> 01:30:43,221
You're in deep shit.

900
01:31:27,008 --> 01:31:34,881
The people who set-up the cameras told me
that Light checked for signs of entry.

901
01:31:37,218 --> 01:31:42,155
Other than that, we found
nothing suspicious in his room.

902
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:45,682
Were all those cameras necessary?

903
01:31:45,727 --> 01:31:51,893
Light's characteristics,
his IQ and lifestyle...

904
01:31:51,933 --> 01:31:54,959
they all fit the profile.

905
01:31:55,003 --> 01:31:58,166
This is a waste of time.

906
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:04,039
If there's even a speck of doubt,
we must continue.

907
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:08,106
Without that determination,
we'll never catch Kira.

908
01:32:15,223 --> 01:32:20,126
Hey Light, talk to me.
No one's watching.

909
01:32:22,664 --> 01:32:24,791
Give me an apple.

910
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:27,825
I demand one!

911
01:32:30,338 --> 01:32:32,898
Come on!

912
01:32:41,816 --> 01:32:43,306
Apples?

913
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:51,921
What's wrong?

914
01:32:53,862 --> 01:32:58,060
L's onto me completely.

915
01:32:58,099 --> 01:33:00,795
Someone's been in my room.
I smell it.

916
01:33:00,835 --> 01:33:06,398
There are cameras and bugs
hidden everywhere.

917
01:33:10,845 --> 01:33:15,578
L wasn't so easy to deal with after all.

918
01:33:15,617 --> 01:33:19,986
As long as I'm being watched,
there are no apples for you.

919
01:33:20,388 --> 01:33:22,481
What?!

920
01:33:23,224 --> 01:33:27,558
Let's look for the cameras
and find a blind spot.

921
01:34:00,495 --> 01:34:06,525
Your son is a hard worker.
You must be very proud.

922
01:34:09,237 --> 01:34:12,434
He wishes to join the Police Agency.

923
01:34:14,409 --> 01:34:18,368
How will my son be cleared?

924
01:34:18,413 --> 01:34:21,678
If he does nothing suspicious,

925
01:34:21,716 --> 01:34:25,049
and there's a murder by Kira.

926
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:29,356
You want us to wait for a murder?

927
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:31,415
It seems so.

928
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:37,225
Have one.

929
01:34:46,941 --> 01:34:49,876
DAY THREE

930
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:55,340
It's dinnertime!

931
01:35:08,029 --> 01:35:09,860
I'm taking a break.

932
01:35:22,343 --> 01:35:26,245
Chief, you must rest.

933
01:35:26,281 --> 01:35:29,307
You haven't slept in three days.

934
01:35:30,351 --> 01:35:35,220
How could I,
when my family are being suspected.

935
01:35:44,999 --> 01:35:47,126
Yes? Understood.

936
01:35:53,508 --> 01:35:58,138
We have confirmed the deaths of...

937
01:35:58,179 --> 01:36:03,139
three killers that were on the run,
and two convicts on death row.

938
01:36:03,184 --> 01:36:05,209
Is that so?

939
01:36:06,454 --> 01:36:08,422
Not too fast.

940
01:36:10,024 --> 01:36:14,427
Have you forgotten
that Kira can manipulate time?

941
01:36:16,097 --> 01:36:22,332
We won't know for sure
until a new crime is reported.

942
01:36:36,551 --> 01:36:40,920
DAY FIVE

943
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:23,957
DAY SEVEN

944
01:37:23,998 --> 01:37:26,466
Aren't you worried?

945
01:37:26,501 --> 01:37:28,969
Dad hasn't come home in a week.

946
01:37:29,003 --> 01:37:30,800
I'm used to it.

947
01:37:31,706 --> 01:37:34,675
Father's hard at work.
You should be, too.

948
01:37:34,709 --> 01:37:36,199
Okay.

949
01:37:38,446 --> 01:37:42,473
Eating chips after dinner
You're gonna get fat.

950
01:37:42,517 --> 01:37:46,954
I'll be up all night studying.
I need my strength.

951
01:37:46,988 --> 01:37:48,216
Thanks for dinner.

952
01:37:51,726 --> 01:37:53,057
Wow!

953
01:38:19,988 --> 01:38:26,120
Trading ended
with a recovery of 10,800 dollars.

954
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:29,789
This morning, crude oil price
had declined to...

955
01:38:29,831 --> 01:38:34,495
60 dollars per barrel.

956
01:38:38,139 --> 01:38:42,735
We have just received
new information.

957
01:38:42,777 --> 01:38:47,407
The suspect accused of kidnapping
a five-year-old girl in Edogawa...

958
01:38:47,448 --> 01:38:50,178
has been arrested.

959
01:38:50,218 --> 01:38:57,715
Toru Kashimayama, age 29,
allegedly kidnapped Kasumi Miuchizawa.

960
01:38:57,759 --> 01:39:02,662
Her body was found buried
under the floor of his apartment.

961
01:39:02,697 --> 01:39:07,760
On the 28th of last month, Kasumi was
playing in a park near her home...

962
01:39:07,802 --> 01:39:17,473
where she was last seen
climbing into a red car.

963
01:39:17,512 --> 01:39:20,379
He's not watching the news.

964
01:39:49,377 --> 01:39:53,814
Something seems to have happened
at the scene.

965
01:39:53,848 --> 01:39:55,372
Mr. Murai

966
01:39:55,416 --> 01:39:57,646
Live from Funabori.

967
01:39:57,685 --> 01:40:02,315
Kashimayama has just died.

968
01:40:02,356 --> 01:40:05,052
According to information...

969
01:40:05,093 --> 01:40:10,156
Kashimayama was said to have been
in the middle of an interrogation...

970
01:40:10,198 --> 01:40:14,294
when he suddenly died of
heart attack.

971
01:40:14,335 --> 01:40:16,803
Mr. Murai?

972
01:40:16,838 --> 01:40:20,330
Do you suspect Kira?

973
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:26,711
The cause of death is still unknown,
but there is that possibility.

974
01:40:26,747 --> 01:40:28,977
This is Kira's latest crime.

975
01:40:29,016 --> 01:40:31,814
Light is no longer under suspicion.

976
01:40:32,753 --> 01:40:35,916
Isn't that enough?

977
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:39,122
Ryuzaki!

978
01:41:10,224 --> 01:41:14,524
"TORU KASHIMAYAMA"

979
01:41:14,795 --> 01:41:18,390
The Chief's and Deputy Chief's families
are cleared.

980
01:41:19,967 --> 01:41:24,336
Ryuzaki, aren't you satisfied?

981
01:41:26,407 --> 01:41:28,307
Watari.

982
01:41:28,342 --> 01:41:32,870
Recover all the bugs and cameras
from their houses.

983
01:41:32,914 --> 01:41:34,745
Understood.

984
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:38,350
You must be relieved, Chief.

985
01:41:38,386 --> 01:41:40,650
It'll be a fresh start.

986
01:41:58,839 --> 01:42:02,900
Light, the cameras are all gone.

987
01:42:24,765 --> 01:42:28,201
There's nothing like
eating apples...

988
01:42:28,236 --> 01:42:30,295
free from the public eye.

989
01:42:34,141 --> 01:42:36,974
But Light.

990
01:42:37,011 --> 01:42:41,914
What if your sister had taken
that bag of chips?

991
01:42:43,584 --> 01:42:47,714
I'm the only one
who likes consommé flavor.

992
01:43:17,084 --> 01:43:21,384
A phone call from Naomi Misora.

993
01:43:24,859 --> 01:43:26,486
It's been a while.

994
01:43:27,194 --> 01:43:28,752
L.

995
01:43:29,897 --> 01:43:35,631
As of now, I will prove to you
that Light Yagami is Kira...

996
01:43:36,604 --> 01:43:38,697
by risking my life.

997
01:43:49,483 --> 01:43:53,146
"Shiori"

998
01:43:54,322 --> 01:43:56,051
Hello?

999
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:58,490
Can we meet?

1000
01:43:58,526 --> 01:43:59,618
Where?

1001
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:00,922
The art gallery.

1002
01:44:00,961 --> 01:44:03,930
I was just thinking about you.

1003
01:44:05,299 --> 01:44:07,358
When can you come?

1004
01:44:08,436 --> 01:44:12,770
I can leave right now so...
in 30 minutes.

1005
01:44:13,841 --> 01:44:15,570
Light...

1006
01:44:16,644 --> 01:44:18,635
You sound strange.

1007
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,311
Shiori?

1008
01:44:39,133 --> 01:44:43,069
We're monitoring the art gallery.

1009
01:44:43,104 --> 01:44:45,004
Let me see it.

1010
01:44:57,718 --> 01:44:59,379
I'm at the entrance.

1011
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:01,285
Come inside.

1012
01:45:01,322 --> 01:45:05,725
I'll be by Ekusuhso Kenak's
"Mask and Death".

1013
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,250
Alright.

1014
01:45:11,665 --> 01:45:14,429
We can see how Kira kills?

1015
01:45:14,468 --> 01:45:17,403
What do you mean by that?

1016
01:45:26,747 --> 01:45:28,374
Light?

1017
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:32,813
I knew it. Kira is Light.

1018
01:45:35,923 --> 01:45:39,256
Is my son still a suspect?

1019
01:45:52,406 --> 01:45:53,600
Shiori.

1020
01:45:53,641 --> 01:45:55,108
Light!

1021
01:45:55,776 --> 01:45:57,801
Forgive me.

1022
01:45:57,845 --> 01:45:59,540
Light Yagami.

1023
01:46:00,714 --> 01:46:05,913
If you want to see her alive,
confess right now.

1024
01:46:07,455 --> 01:46:09,423
That you've killed Raye.

1025
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:12,857
And that you are Kira!

1026
01:46:16,664 --> 01:46:18,131
Get some cops in there!

1027
01:46:22,036 --> 01:46:24,402
You've got it all wrong.

1028
01:46:24,438 --> 01:46:25,905
I'm not Kira.

1029
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:28,408
If you keep on lying...

1030
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:31,372
I'll kill her.

1031
01:46:31,412 --> 01:46:32,936
No!

1032
01:46:33,514 --> 01:46:36,915
Even if I were,
she has nothing to do with it.

1033
01:46:36,951 --> 01:46:39,351
Kill me instead!

1034
01:46:39,386 --> 01:46:44,221
I'll teach you the pain of
losing your loved one.

1035
01:46:44,258 --> 01:46:45,885
Don't do it!

1036
01:46:46,794 --> 01:46:48,853
Please, not Shiori.

1037
01:46:48,896 --> 01:46:50,295
Light...

1038
01:46:51,632 --> 01:46:53,827
How miserable you are!

1039
01:46:54,869 --> 01:47:01,035
The almighty Kira,
begging for his girlfriend's life.

1040
01:47:01,075 --> 01:47:04,374
I'm telling you, I'm not Kira!

1041
01:47:04,411 --> 01:47:06,174
You can't kill without a name.

1042
01:47:06,213 --> 01:47:07,942
I'll tell you mine.

1043
01:47:11,752 --> 01:47:14,380
Naomi Misora.

1044
01:47:15,623 --> 01:47:25,521
Naomi is in katakana characters,
and Misora, Chinese ones.

1045
01:47:26,567 --> 01:47:33,564
Now that you know my name,
go ahead and kill me!

1046
01:47:40,447 --> 01:47:42,540
Naomi Misora...

1047
01:47:45,686 --> 01:47:46,414
The police?

1048
01:47:46,453 --> 01:47:47,943
They're almost there.

1049
01:47:47,988 --> 01:47:50,923
No, hold them back a little longer.

1050
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:52,289
What?

1051
01:47:52,326 --> 01:47:54,021
Here's the good part.

1052
01:47:54,061 --> 01:47:58,088
How dare you! This isn't a show.

1053
01:47:58,832 --> 01:48:01,528
You want to save her?

1054
01:48:01,569 --> 01:48:03,764
Then kill me.

1055
01:48:04,605 --> 01:48:07,165
Like you did Raye.

1056
01:48:07,207 --> 01:48:10,768
Like all the criminals
you've executed.

1057
01:48:10,811 --> 01:48:15,680
Go on and kill
without laying a hand on me!

1058
01:48:15,716 --> 01:48:18,514
But I'm not Kira!

1059
01:49:12,606 --> 01:49:13,698
Shiori!

1060
01:49:14,642 --> 01:49:17,110
Please... no.

1061
01:49:17,811 --> 01:49:19,642
Shiori...

1062
01:49:20,981 --> 01:49:24,075
This can't be happening!

1063
01:49:25,052 --> 01:49:25,848
Shiori?

1064
01:49:36,597 --> 01:49:38,087
She's armed.

1065
01:49:38,465 --> 01:49:42,299
Shiori, hang in there.

1066
01:49:42,336 --> 01:49:44,600
Shiori.

1067
01:49:44,638 --> 01:49:46,230
Light...

1068
01:49:46,907 --> 01:49:48,272
Shiori...

1069
01:49:59,019 --> 01:50:03,581
That was... our last kiss.

1070
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:20,973
Why?!

1071
01:50:22,209 --> 01:50:24,507
Why did you shoot her?

1072
01:50:25,412 --> 01:50:29,405
Tell me!

1073
01:50:38,959 --> 01:50:40,290
Stop!

1074
01:50:50,804 --> 01:50:54,934
This was a miscalculation.

1075
01:50:55,476 --> 01:51:02,439
Naomi Misora's miscalculation was
that I saw her.

1076
01:51:02,483 --> 01:51:08,319
She also shouldn't have told me
she was Raye's fiancé.

1077
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:12,048
Nobody uses false names on weddings.

1078
01:51:12,860 --> 01:51:15,920
The church is open to everyone,

1079
01:51:16,530 --> 01:51:20,796
so it was easy to find out her name.

1080
01:51:27,474 --> 01:51:30,602
Naomi Misora, suicide.

1081
01:51:31,345 --> 01:51:37,113
Arranges to meet with
her fiancé's killer.

1082
01:51:37,151 --> 01:51:43,750
Takes his girlfriend hostage
at the Omei Art Gallery.

1083
01:51:43,791 --> 01:51:49,889
She makes the girlfriend call him
on April 15th, 14:15.

1084
01:51:51,298 --> 01:51:57,362
She then contacts a third party;
the Investigation Team...

1085
01:51:57,404 --> 01:52:03,434
and tries to make the killer confess
as they watch.

1086
01:52:04,178 --> 01:52:10,742
At 14:55, she stops
the hostage from running away...

1087
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:19,055
but in a moment of madness,
ends up shooting herself.

1088
01:52:40,247 --> 01:52:41,839
I'm sorry.

1089
01:52:43,717 --> 01:52:47,084
If only we'd gotten here earlier.

1090
01:52:52,726 --> 01:52:55,058
I'll send for a car.

1091
01:53:01,869 --> 01:53:06,499
Didn't expect Shiori to die,
did you?

1092
01:53:15,015 --> 01:53:20,282
I'm the one who killed Shiori.

1093
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,810
Huh?

1094
01:53:22,556 --> 01:53:25,889
With the help of "Death Note".

1095
01:53:25,926 --> 01:53:28,588
But how?

1096
01:53:29,129 --> 01:53:34,761
Naomi ended up killing Shiori,
but you can't make people kill.

1097
01:53:35,569 --> 01:53:40,939
If you write their names,
they'd all die of heart attacks.

1098
01:53:41,375 --> 01:53:43,866
I know.

1099
01:53:45,178 --> 01:53:52,016
That's why I wrote Shiori's name
on the page next to Naomi's.

1100
01:54:01,628 --> 01:54:06,497
Shiori Akino,
killed by a third person.

1101
01:54:08,035 --> 01:54:12,301
Get's kidnapped
at the Omei Art Gallery.

1102
01:54:12,339 --> 01:54:20,269
On April 15th, 14:15, she is
forced to call up her boyfriend.

1103
01:54:21,315 --> 01:54:25,684
She gets away
as the police break in.

1104
01:54:25,719 --> 01:54:27,311
But at 14:55,
a warning shot hits her...

1105
01:54:27,354 --> 01:54:35,591
and she dies trying to protect
her boyfriend.

1106
01:54:38,465 --> 01:54:41,832
It didn't have to say anything about
Naomi shooting Shiori or vice versa.

1107
01:54:42,402 --> 01:54:45,894
It didn't have to say anything about
Naomi shooting Shiori or vice versa.

1108
01:54:45,939 --> 01:54:51,138
Does that mean,
Naomi just happened to kill Shiori?

1109
01:54:51,178 --> 01:54:53,646
A coincidence?

1110
01:54:54,815 --> 01:55:00,811
That's hardly a perfect scheme
for killing Shiori.

1111
01:55:01,521 --> 01:55:05,821
It was no coincidence.
I planned everything.

1112
01:55:07,494 --> 01:55:14,024
All I wrote was that
Shiori would be killed by a gunshot.

1113
01:55:14,067 --> 01:55:19,767
And that Naomi would carry a gun
in order to shoot herself.

1114
01:55:19,806 --> 01:55:24,209
No one carries a gun around
in Japan...

1115
01:55:24,244 --> 01:55:30,376
which means that the gun Naomi has,
would be shot at Shiori.

1116
01:55:32,853 --> 01:55:35,083
Hear this.

1117
01:55:35,122 --> 01:55:41,027
"Death Note" changes our destinies
in the most natural way.

1118
01:55:41,995 --> 01:55:45,522
So even though it wasn't written,

1119
01:55:46,233 --> 01:55:49,202
everything went according to my plan.

1120
01:55:49,236 --> 01:55:53,468
You're a devil in disguise.

1121
01:55:58,645 --> 01:56:02,877
My girlfriend was killed
before my eyes.

1122
01:56:02,916 --> 01:56:08,479
If I tell them I want to
join the team and capture Kira...

1123
01:56:08,522 --> 01:56:14,222
everyone would sympathize and
believe me without a doubt.

1124
01:56:25,238 --> 01:56:27,172
Light, you know what?

1125
01:56:27,207 --> 01:56:34,113
You're far worse than god of death.

1126
01:56:36,883 --> 01:56:41,081
Shiori truly loved you.

1127
01:56:42,689 --> 01:56:47,388
Didn't you love her at all?

1128
01:56:51,965 --> 01:56:54,525
I don't know.

1129
01:57:03,577 --> 01:57:07,069
Misa, I know you're lonely.

1130
01:57:07,114 --> 01:57:09,514
Don't come close to me!

1131
01:57:09,549 --> 01:57:13,417
You're the one who said
you wanted to die.

1132
01:57:13,453 --> 01:57:15,717
I didn't say such a thing.

1133
01:57:15,755 --> 01:57:19,156
Let's go to heaven.
Your parents are waiting.

1134
01:57:19,192 --> 01:57:21,057
We'll go together.

1135
01:57:24,397 --> 01:57:27,389
You're an assistant director.

1136
01:57:28,235 --> 01:57:32,331
I'll tell, and you'll lose
your job forever!

1137
01:57:32,806 --> 01:57:38,108
I've been watching you
at the studio, in the hallway.

1138
01:57:38,745 --> 01:57:42,181
We'll die together.
I'm giving you my life.

1139
01:57:43,216 --> 01:57:45,207
That's my destiny.

1140
01:57:45,252 --> 01:57:46,685
Moron!

1141
01:57:47,521 --> 01:57:52,584
Who said I want to go to heaven
or to hell?

1142
01:57:59,533 --> 01:58:03,367
Don't worry. It won't hurt a bit.

1143
01:58:04,104 --> 01:58:06,072
No...

1144
01:58:07,674 --> 01:58:11,474
Somebody! Help me!

1145
01:59:19,145 --> 01:59:22,239
Light, your car's here.

1146
01:59:25,785 --> 01:59:28,549
Let's get you home.

1147
01:59:28,588 --> 01:59:32,615
Father, I have a request.

1148
01:59:32,659 --> 01:59:34,354
What is it?

1149
01:59:35,095 --> 01:59:38,121
Let me on the team.

1150
01:59:40,467 --> 01:59:44,369
Shiori was killed because of Kira.

1151
01:59:45,739 --> 01:59:48,469
I'll never forgive him.

1152
01:59:48,508 --> 01:59:52,740
So please put me on the team.

1153
01:59:55,348 --> 01:59:57,077
We welcome you!

1154
02:00:06,092 --> 02:00:09,186
We meet at last.

1155
02:00:11,898 --> 02:00:13,889
I am L.

1156
02:00:17,404 --> 02:00:19,736
Lend us your brain.

1157
02:00:23,076 --> 02:00:26,045
We'll capture Kira together.

1158
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:45,494
First, apologize.

1159
02:00:46,305 --> 02:01:46,619
