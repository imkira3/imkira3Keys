2
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,160
Mrs. Peterson!

3
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,579
Ramon, hey! How's it goin'?

4
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,998
How you doin'?

5
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,125
There it is,
right there on the desk.

6
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,545
- Where's she headed?
- She's snowbound, Ramon.

7
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,302
- See you went with the pink.
- Yeah, yeah.

8
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,513
It's kind of a pink day today.

9
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,474
I'm gonna have another pickup
for you on Thursday.

10
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,726
- All right. We'll see you then.
- All right. Thanks, Ramon.

11
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,639
Peterson! Peterson!

12
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,059
Peterson.

13
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,314
- Mr. Cowboy, da?
- Da.

14
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,864
Mmm, it's pretty.

15
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,033
Mmm. It's from my wife.

16
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,519
Time...

17
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,938
rules over us without mercy...

18
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,775
not caring if we're healthy or ill,
hungry or drunk...

19
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,487
Russian, American,
beings from Mars.

20
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,490
It's like a fire.
It could either destroy us or keep us warm.

21
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,243
That's why every FedEx office
has a clock.

22
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,162
Because we live or we die
by the clock.

23
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,164
We never turn our back on it.

24
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,291
And we never, ever
allow ourselves...

25
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,670
the sin of losing track
of time!

26
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,839
Locally, it's 1:56.

27
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,759
That means we've got
three hours and four minutes...

28
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,761
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.

29
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,014
That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have...

30
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,185
before this pulsating, accursed,
relentless taskmaster...

31
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,855
tries to put us
out of business.

32
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,024
Hey, Nicolai. Hey.
Nicolai, good to see you.

33
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,985
How are you, kid?
Look what you did.

34
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,195
You just delivered
your very first FedEx package.

35
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,866
That deserves something special,
like a Snickers bar...

36
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,785
and a C.D. player.

37
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,787
And something to listen to...
a C.D. There.

38
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,665
Elvis Presley. Fifty million fans
can't be wrong.

39
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,667
You all recognize this,
don't you?

40
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,461
I took the liberty
of sending this to myself.

41
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:24,508
I FedEx'd it
before I left Memphis.

42
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,719
You're probably wondering
what could be in here.

43
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,138
What could it possibly be?
Is it architectural plans?

44
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,140
Maybe technical drawings?

45
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,976
Is this the new wallpaper
for the... for the bathroom?

46
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,814
It is... a clock...

47
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,816
which I started
at absolute zero...

48
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:45,863
and is now at 87 hours,
22 minutes and 17 seconds.

49
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:50,826
From Memphis, America
to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.

50
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,121
Eighty-seven hours
is a shameful outrage.

51
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,249
This is just an egg timer!

52
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,085
What if it had been something else?
Like your paycheck?

53
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,734
Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?

54
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,424
Eighty-seven hours
is an eternity.

55
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,468
The cosmos was created
in less time!

56
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,346
Wars have been fought and
nations toppled in 87 hours!

57
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,348
Fortunes made and squandered.

58
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,479
What?

59
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,481
What are you saying about me?

60
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,483
I tell them,
what do they expect?

61
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,278
This man, when his truck broke down, he
stole a boy's bicycle to do his delivery.

62
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,073
I borrowed it!
I borrowed a kid's bike.

63
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,742
And I got my packages
delivered, and that is

64
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,326
what you people are gonna
have to start doing.

65
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,955
You have to start doing whatever it takes,
because in three hours and two minutes...

66
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,124
every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck...

67
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,126
and on its way to the airport.

68
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,754
Fifteen minutes!

69
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,132
- Crunch time! Crunch time!
- Crunch time!

70
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,469
Let's go! Every package
on the airport truck.

71
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,638
Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch!

72
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,640
- We have a big problem.
- What?

73
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,434
- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What do you mean?

74
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,145
- It's stuck.
- Stuck how? In snow? In ice?

75
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,732
It's stuck! The most important truck...
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.

76
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,078
All right, all right, all right.
Let's put the table right here.

77
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,080
We'll just do the sort.

78
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,333
Ah, yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

79
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,003
Let's go. Unload...
Get him out of there.

80
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,630
Right here.
Two lines, two lines.

81
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,591
One to the airport truck,
one to the Moscow truck.

82
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,343
Got it?

83
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,014
C.D.G., F.E., M.E, Memphis on the airport
truck. Everything else right there.

84
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,766
Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Four minutes.

85
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,688
- Hi, this is Kelly.
- If you're calling for Chuck, press one.

86
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,940
Otherwise leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.

87
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,026
Hello, Kelly. Are you there?

88
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,611
Pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up. You're not there.

89
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,698
You're not gonna believe this. I'm doin'
the sorts in the middle of Red Square...

90
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,700
in the shadow of Lenin's tomb.

91
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,749
I'm outta here in two minutes and I'm
pickin' up the sweep through Paris...

92
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,418
so I should be back in Memphis
about 18 hours or so.

93
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,628
That's the good news.
The bad news is...

94
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,630
I gotta go to
the dentist this week.

95
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,674
I got something in there
that's hurtin'.

96
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,552
I love you and I'm gonna see you soon,
and you know what that means.

97
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,305
Bye-bye. Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock!

98
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,826
I absolutely, positively have
to get to Memphis tonight.

99
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,953
Can't help you. Try U.P.S.

100
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,706
With this extra head wind, are we gonna
be able to push it and make the sort?

101
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,167
- We'll do our best.
- "Our best," huh?

102
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,378
Gwen, is there something
wrong with our doctors

103
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,505
that Jack keeps getting
certified to fly?

104
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,924
- Aren't you concerned?
- I'm terrified.

105
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,967
But a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

106
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,929
That's the spirit.
Relentless is our goal. Relentless!

107
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,182
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle...

108
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,601
- when his truck broke down?
- I borrowed it.

109
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,812
But I love that
the kid's now crippled.

110
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,397
So you missed the last truck
by two minutes?

111
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,359
Two minutes.
Actually, it was less than that.

112
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,362
The plane wasn't that heavy.
You could've added some fuel...

113
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,364
picked up the speed
and made up the time.

114
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,617
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

115
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,703
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late, and
then six minutes and eight minutes late.

116
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,791
- Next thing you know, we're the U.S. Mail.
- Yeah, well...

117
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,377
All I'm sayin' is, if you'd gotten
all those trucks on the plane...

118
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,213
those Russkies would be
walking on water right now.

119
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,757
Hey, don't...
Don't gimme that look.

120
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,301
- It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,471
It's like a 1992
full-bodied grape juice.

122
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,807
I see no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.

123
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,227
We'd offer you some but, you know,
somebody's got to fly the plane.

124
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,772
Yeah, well,
I "just say no," right?

125
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,650
Listen, Stan,
I've been meaning to ask you.

126
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,777
How's Mary?

127
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,156
Oh. Uh, well...

128
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,325
- we really don't know anything yet.
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,289
Uh, she went to the doctor yesterday,
and, uh...

130
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,168
it hasn't meta...
metastasized...

131
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,212
as far as they
can tell right now.

132
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,215
It's just kind of wait and see.

133
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,509
I'm so sorry.

134
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,804
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

135
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,183
I want you to know, Stan, we are
all thinking about her and you.

136
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,977
- And just blessings.
- Thank you, Gwen.

137
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,688
Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.

138
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,691
Otherwise, leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.

139
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,657
Stan.

140
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,202
Listen.
Uh, I heard about this...

141
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,165
I heard about this doctor
down in Emory, in Atlanta.

142
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,167
Uh, he's supposed to be
the absolute best.

143
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,336
He worked on
Frank Toretta's wife.

144
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,338
Frank Toretta is
a systems analyst.

145
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,882
He played center field for us.
You know him.

146
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,635
In the softball tournament
last Labor Day.

147
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,553
Anyway, beside the point.

148
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:06,225
Uh, what I was thinking is,
is that I could get his number...

149
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,894
the doctor... and, uh...

150
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,480
you know,
put you all together and...

151
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,400
You know, you could
get this thing fixed.

152
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,444
You could beat it.

153
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,697
Thanks, Chuck.

154
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,242
So, I'll get his number.

155
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,559
- Is Kelly Frears around?
- She's copying her dissertation.

156
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,427
- You're home.
- Home indeed.

157
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,429
I love that you're home.

158
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,992
Just days before Santa

159
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,577
departs on his annual
gift-giving venture...

160
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,580
he's been declared
physically fit to fly.

161
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,500
Santa got checked out by doctors
at the V.A. Hospital in Augusta, Georgia.

162
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,420
After they declared
the jolly old elf in tiptop shape...

163
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,007
Santa Claus took off into the wild
blue yonder for an early start.

164
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,593
In Sarajevo,
he spent the day with children...

165
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,512
handing out presents and
even helping them decorate...

166
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,556
the special Christmas tree.

167
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,063
Santa and a sea of elves
took over the floor...

168
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,065
at the Hong Kong
Futures Exchange.

169
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,525
Market traders
bought Santa hats, donating...

170
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,050
The turkey's a little dry,
isn't it?

171
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,636
- No.
- The turkey is perfect.

172
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,726
- How many did you do last night?
- Last night? 2.9 million.

173
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,397
Now you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.

174
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,898
Here you go.

175
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,942
2.9 has got to be the record.

176
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,944
Look at those marshmallows.

177
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,029
When I was there,
we did two million.

178
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,615
- We thought that was a big deal.
- The glory days.

179
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,243
- What'd they do the first night?
- The very first night?

180
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,245
- Twelve.
- Twelve thousand?

181
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,997
- Hell, no. Twelve.
- That's right.

182
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,834
And they did the sort
right there on a card table.

183
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,628
And Fred Smith had
that card table bronzed.

184
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,423
I've been hearing that
for five years.

185
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,592
It's in his office today.

186
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,677
They go from that to the
new hub up in Anchorage.

187
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,679
It's state of the art...
a perfect marriage...

188
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,223
between technology
and systems management.

189
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,059
Speaking of marriage, Chuck, when are you
gonna make an honest woman out of Kelly?

190
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,314
- How long?
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.

191
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,651
- You won. I owe you $5.
- So I win.

192
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,736
- Way before the pie.
- I told him on the way up.

193
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,948
Right about the time the pie
came out, the marriage...

194
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,034
Kelly is still recovering from her failed
relationship with that parolee.

195
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,287
He was a lawyer.

196
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,622
I knew it had something to do
with raising your right hand...

197
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,624
and swearing to tell the truth.

198
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,252
Remember when he fell
on the sidewalk and

199
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,794
broke his shoulder at
the wedding reception?

200
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,630
He tripped on a curb
holding a door open for me.

201
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,050
- Aunt Kelly was married before?
- It's not even worth remembering.

202
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,012
So since her failed marriage
to the parolee...

203
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,598
Oh, my God.

204
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,100
Kelly can't see being with a
man who wears a pager to bed.

205
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,144
What're you gonna
attach it to, Hoss?

206
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,105
When you wear it to bed, I hope
you got one of those things...

207
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,024
that go vibratin'.

208
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,526
Watch it.
I'm not touching that.

209
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,988
Oh, did you hit an olive pit?

210
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,326
- I thought I took all of them out.
- No, no, it's not that.

211
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,938
- Okay, I'll cancel Saturday.
- No, don't.

212
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,940
If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, well...

213
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,942
- then I am.
- It's cancelled.

214
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,944
But you gotta be here
New Year's Eve.

215
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,446
Malaysia can't be that bad.
I'll be here New Year's Eve.

216
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,990
- When are you defending your dissertation?
- January 12.

217
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:18,495
I'm gonna have to switch
over the South America thing.

218
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,914
If I do that
on the third or fourth...

219
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,916
I'm gonna have to head
back out on the 13th.

220
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,210
So long as you're here
New Year's Eve.

221
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,296
I will be here New Year's Eve.
I promise.

222
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,782
What?

223
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:35,971
What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.

224
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,184
We have to do it in the car.

225
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,568
I'd just like a minute
over here, all right? Thanks.

226
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,493
Two minutes, okay?

227
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,121
Two more minutes. Thanks. Hey!

228
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,665
- Merry Christmas.
- I thought you were gonna stiff me.

229
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,146
No.

230
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,543
- What is the ribbon?
Is it a thousand-pound...

231
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,963
- test fishing line or something?
- Here's your fancy thing.

232
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,799
Thanks.

233
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,846
I love the wrapping.

234
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,474
- And I love the box.
- Good.

235
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:28,231
Oh. Oh, my.

236
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,276
Oh, that is terrific.

237
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,862
My grandaddy used it
on the Southern Pacific.

238
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,535
Hey, I took this. This is
my favorite picture of you.

239
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,081
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm always gonna keep this...

240
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,876
on Memphis time.

241
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,631
Kelly time.

242
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,758
Hmm.

243
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,801
You haven't said anything about
your presents. Is there a problem?

244
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,970
I'm sorry, no! I love 'em.

245
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,264
Look at my journal. Ah!

246
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:05,101
- What about the pager?
- Real leather. The pages have gold on 'em.

247
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,228
- Did you like the pager or not?
- Yes.

248
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,066
I love it. Look at him in
his little blue Russian house.

249
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,027
- It's from Russia.
- My God.

250
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,572
- It's not one of those loud ones?
- No. You can program it so it vibrates...

251
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,241
and lights up
and see it in the dark.

252
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,371
It seems like
a real nice pager.

253
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,290
Sorry about the hand towels.
You're hard to shop for.

254
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,124
No, no. I love 'em.

255
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,231
Every time I wash my hands,
I will think of you.

256
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:32,253
All right, I gotta go.

257
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,257
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

258
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,259
- I love you.
- I love you too.

259
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,603
Chuck! Keys!

260
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,658
- Thank you.
- That reminds me. I almost forgot.

261
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,161
I have one more present
for you.

262
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:10,375
Only this isn't an "open in the car"
kind of present...

263
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,377
like, say, hand towels.

264
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,921
Which were a joke, by the way.

265
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,678
I'm terrified.

266
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,848
Just take it and hold onto it,
and you can open it...

267
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,559
on New Year's Eve.

268
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,602
And I love you.

269
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,151
I'll be right back.

270
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,614
Hey, Al, where are we?

271
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,657
Somewhere over
the Pacific Ocean.

272
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,285
Ha, ha, ha!
You pilots, you're funny.

273

Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

274
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,582
Position Jenna at 1526...

275
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,627
Is all this turbulence from Santa
and those eight tiny reindeer?

276
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,296
Tamara at 1620.

277
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,632
Erick is next.

278
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,343
Fuel: niner-five-decimal-five.

279
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,678
Blaine, tell them we're
deviating south for weather.

280
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,139
Make another position plot
on your deviation left.

281

Tahiti Control,

282
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,394
Position Jenna at 1526.

283
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,855
- Flight level 350.
- I got us plotted.

284
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,858
We're 200 miles south
of our original course.

285
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,653
Continue plotting,
and check contingency procedures.

How do you read?

288
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,701
I've never been
out of comm this long.

289
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,830
Did you try the higher
H.F. frequency?

Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

291
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,377
Better buckle up, Chuck.
It's gonna get bumpy.

293
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,465

Flight level 350.

297
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,149
Expecting Tamara at 1...

298
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,402
Fire! Explosion!

299
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,404
Let's get a hose!

300
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,327
Hold on to it! Come on!

301
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,664
Seat belt!

302
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,840
We may have to ditch!

303
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,393
Okay?

304
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,812
Fire in the hold!

305
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,898
We're goin' down!

306
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,359
Mayday! Mayday!

307
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,205
Bringing it down and out!

308
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,291
Ten thousand feet! Masks off!

309
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,710
Masks off!

310
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,049
Chuck! Life vest!

311
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,834
Chuck! Chuck, stay there!

312
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,795
Where's your life vest?

313
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,446
Ditching switch on!

314
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,254
I've got visual!

315
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,802
Brace for impact!

316
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,295
Hello!

317
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,107
Hello!

318
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,109
Anybody!

319
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,789
Anybody!

320
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:58,090
Help!

321
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,927
What is that?

322
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,558
Hey!

323
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,071
Hey!

324
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,740
Anybody?

325
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,452
Hello?

326
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,314
Get! Go, go. Go! Go!

327
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,208
"Albert R. Miller."

328
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,503
Not Alan. Albert.

329
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,294
So, that's it.

330
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,305
Hey! A ship!

331
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:08,643
Hey! Hey!

332
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,104
A ship! Over here!

333
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,440
Hey! Hey!

334
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,318
Over here! Over here!

335
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,784
Over here!

336
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,454
Over here! Over here!

337
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,124
Help me! Help!
Right here! Right here!

338
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,126
Help! Look here!
Look, look, look!

339
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:38,172
S... O... S! Please!

340
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:41,134
Help! Come on!

341
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,927
Help!

342
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,512
"Happy birthday."

343
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:52,643
"The most beautiful thing in the world is,
of course, the world itself.

344
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,855
Johnny, have the happiest birthday ever.
Score. Your Grandpa."

345
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,016
Ew.

346
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,254
Come on.

347
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:14,011
Come on. Come on.

348
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,909
You wouldn't have a match...
by any chance, would you?

349
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,166
Oh, oh, oh!

350
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,600
The air got to it.

351
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,602
The air got to it!

352
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,689
Come on, come on. Come on.

353
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,822
I did it. I did it.

354
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,994
Fire!

355
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,205
There you go!

356
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,332
Light it up! Come on!

357
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:24,673
Ouch!

358
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:41,940
Here you go! Here you go!

359
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,276
It's a signal fire!

360
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,780
And it spells out S.O.S!

361
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,740
Whoa!

362
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,202
It's a meteor shower!

363
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,204
Fireflies! Go! Run!

364
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,207
You're free! You're free!
Ouch! Ouch!

365
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,209
Yeah!

366
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,545
Yes!

367
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,089
Look what I have created!

368
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:08,341
I have made fire!

369
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:11,803
I... have made fire!

370
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:25,692
Mmm!

371
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,576
You gotta love crab.

372
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,705
In the nick of time too.

373
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,710
I couldn't take much more
of those coconuts.

374
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,879
Coconut milk's
a natural laxative.

375
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,842
Things that Gilligan
never told us.

376
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,844
Oh.

377
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,108
Pretty well-made fire,
huh, Wilson?

378
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,453
So... Wilson.

379
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,789
We were en route...

380
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:24,960
from Memphis
for 11 and a half hours.

381
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:29,005
About 475 miles an hour.

382
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:33,051
So they think that
we are right here.

383
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,053
But...

384
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:38,223
we went out of radio contact...

385
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:42,644
and flew around that storm
for about an hour.

386
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:45,605
So that's a distance
of what, 400 miles?

387
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,275
Four hundred miles squared.

388
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:53,279
That's 160,000...

389
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:57,033
times pi... 3.14.

390
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:04,457
Five hundred and two thousand,
four...

391
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:08,420
That's a search area
of 500,000 square miles.

392
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,133
That's twice the size of Texas.

393
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,512
They may never find us.

394
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,415
This tooth is just killing me.

395
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,001
It started out just hurting
when I bit down...

396
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:51,713
but now it just hurts
all the time.

397
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,466
All the time.

398
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,218
It's-It's a good thing there's
not much to eat around here...

399
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,471
because I don't think
I could chew it.

400
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:04,851
Just keep sucking on all that coconut
and all that crab.

401
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:09,230
And just think...

402
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,775
I used to avoid
going to the dentist...

403
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:15,028
like the plague.

404
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:18,740
I put it off every single chance I got.
But now...

405
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:22,744
oh, what I wouldn't give...

406
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:25,955
to have a-a dentist
right here in this cave.

407
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,546
In fact,
I wish you were a dentist.

408
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,262
Yeah.

409
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,264
Dr. Wilson.

410
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,568
You wanna hear something funny?

411
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:00,240
Back home in Memphis...

412
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:04,202
my dentist's name is
Dr. James Spaulding.

413
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,975
She's much prettier
in real life.

414
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,110
Shut up!

415
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:54,051
"Bakersfield"?

416
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,058
Bakersfield!

417
01:23:57,991 --> 01:23:59,951
This could work.

418
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,371
This could work.

419
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:40,992
Twenty-two...
Forty-four lashings.

420
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,954
Forty-four lashings. So...

421
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:49,333
We have to make rope again.

422
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,673
Wilson, we're gonna have to make
a hell of a lot of rope.

423
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:04,765
Eight lashings
of these structurals.

424
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,768
That's 24 apiece.

425
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:11,272
That'll be 100... 160.

426
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,524
Here we are today.

427
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:18,237
That gives us another month and a half
until we're into March and April...

428
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:21,616
which is our best chances for the
high tides and the offshore breezes.

429
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:28,581
We need... We need 424 feet...

430
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:32,209
of good rope, plus another 50 feet,
say, for miscellaneous.

431
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:36,672
Round that off to
475 feet of good rope.

432
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:40,926
Now, if we average
15 feet a day...

433
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:45,306
Plus, we have to build it...

434
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:49,060
we have to stock it,
we have to launch it.

435
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:53,814
That's gonna be tight.

436
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,858
That is not much time.

437
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,153
But we...

438
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:01,906
We live and we die by time,
don't we?

439
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:07,995
Now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

440
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:18,589
I know.

441
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,860
This is it.

442
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:45,366
That's all that's left.

443
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,536
I checked over the whole island,
and that is all that's left.

444
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,579
So we're gonna be short.

445
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,793
Short.

446
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,885
We'll just have to make some more
out of the videotape.

447
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:08,889
Yes. No, we have time.

448
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:10,891
We do. We have time. Look!

449
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:13,185
The wind's still blowing in
from the west.

450
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:22,278
I know!

451
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:25,489
Yeah, I know... I know where
there's 30 feet of extra rope!

452
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:28,909
But... But I'm not
going back up there.

453
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:44,235
There, there.
There, you see? Huh?

454
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,904
There. Are you happy?

455
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:57,498
Do you have to keep bringing that up?
Can't you just forget it?

456
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,959
Huh? You were right.

457
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,629
You were right. It was a good thing
that we did a test...

458
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:07,174
'cause it wasn't gonna be
just a quick little snap.

459
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,344
I would have landed
on the rocks.

460
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:15,140
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.
Bled to death.

461
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:17,935
But it was the only option I had
at the time though, okay?

462
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,563
It was what, a year ago?

463
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:22,606
So let's just forget it.

464
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,113
And what is your point?

465
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:33,492
Well...

466
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:35,494
we might just make it.

467
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,538
Did that thought
ever cross your brain?

468
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:43,085
Well, regardless, I would rather
take my chance out there on the ocean...

469
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:46,171
than to stay here and die
on this shithole island...

470
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:51,552
spending the rest of my life talking
to a goddamn volleyball!

471
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,684
Shut you up.

472
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:09,111
Wilson! Wilson!

473
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:17,953
Wilson!

474
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:23,417
Wilson!

475
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,088
Wilson.

476
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:32,009
Wilson!

477
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:37,806
Oh, God! Wilson!

478
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,850
Wilson!

479
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:47,316
Oh! Oh!

480
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,611
Never again.
Never again, never again.

481
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:53,864
You're okay. You okay? Yeah.

482
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:14,969
Yeah, I know you.

483
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:17,471
I know you. I know you.

484
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:25,688
So, we okay?

485
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:29,191
Okay?

486
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:33,404
Okay.

487
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,669
You still awake?

488
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,299
Me too.

489
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:26,850
You scared?

490
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:32,022
Me too.

491
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,728
Okay. Here we go, Wilson.

492
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:56,023
You don't have to worry
about anything.

493
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:58,275
I'll do all the paddling.

494
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:00,277
You just hang on.

495
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:49,493
Not yet! Hold on!

496
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:03,423
Not yet! Not yet!

497
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,760
Not yet!

498
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,475
Stand by, Wilson!

499
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:16,353
Hold on! Hold on, Wilson!

500
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:36,873
I think we did it!

501
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:41,128
I think we did it!

502
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:43,171
Wilson!

503
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:47,384
I think we did it!

504
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:22,933
Oh! They're gone!

505
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:30,065
I don't know why!

506
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:55,191
Where's Wilson?

507
01:41:57,153 --> 01:42:00,030
Where's Wilson?

508
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:02,032
Wilson, where are you?

509
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:05,619
Wilson!

510
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:13,376
Wilson!

511
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:42,489
Wilson!

512
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:45,033
I'm comin'!

513
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:48,745
Wilson!

514
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,267
Wilson!

515
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:13,770
Wilson...

516
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:21,111
Wilson!

517
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,536
Wilson! Wilson!

518
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:43,883
Wilson!

519
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:49,305
Wilson!

520
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:51,725
I'm sorry!

521
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:55,437
I'm sorry, Wilson!

522
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:58,106
Wilson, I'm sorry!

523
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:01,693
I'm sorry!

524
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:03,903
Wilson!

525
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:06,072
I can't!

526
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:08,116
Wilson!

527
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:11,828
Wilson!

528
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:52,076
I'm... I'm sorry.

529
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:56,998
I'm sorry.

530
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:01,795
I'm sorry.

531
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:04,709
Kelly.

532
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:12,091
Kelly.

533
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:15,470
Kelly.

534
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:24,270
Hello? Oh, how are you?

535
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,149
Okay.

536
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:12,318
Forty-five minutes.

537
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:15,113
One Dr. Pepper.

538
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:17,365
Two cups of ice.

539
01:48:17,449 --> 01:48:19,409
I like ice.

540
01:48:22,246 --> 01:48:23,997
Well, here's the drill.

541
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:27,041
Um, plane pulls in,
we get off...

542
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:29,919
and there's a little ceremony
right there in the hangar.

543
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:33,589
Fred Smith
will say a few words.

544
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:37,135
All you have to do is smile
and say "thank you."

545
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:40,680
Then we'll take you over
to see Kelly.

546
01:48:43,267 --> 01:48:45,226
She's actually gonna
be there, huh?

547
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:48,896
Well, that's what
we have arranged.

548
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:50,732
I mean, if you're sure
you wanna do that.

549
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,942
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes.

550
01:48:57,114 --> 01:48:59,282
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to her.

551
01:49:00,826 --> 01:49:03,036
What in the world
am I gonna say to her?

552
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:10,293
Chuck, Kelly had to let you go.

553
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:12,545
You know?

554
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:15,381
She thought you were dead.

555
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:17,508
And we buried you.

556
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:23,306
We had a funeral and a coffin
and a gravestone.

557
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:25,349
The whole thing.

558
01:49:26,602 --> 01:49:28,519
You had a coffin?

559
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:33,191
What was in it?

560
01:49:34,485 --> 01:49:37,236
Well, everybody put
something in.

561
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:42,075
You know, just a cell phone
or a beeper, some pictures.

562
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:44,243
I put in some Elvis CDs.

563
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:49,123
So you had my funeral...

564
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:54,170
and then you had
Mary's funeral.

565
01:49:59,009 --> 01:50:02,678
Stan, I'm so sorry
I wasn't around when Mary died.

566
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:08,893
I should've been there for you,
and I wasn't.

567
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:15,233
I'm so sorry.

568
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:17,777
Four years ago...

569
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:21,906
the FedEx family lost
five of our sons.

570
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:25,076
That was a terrible
and tragic day.

571
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:29,288
But today, one of those sons...

572
01:50:29,373 --> 01:50:33,251
Chuck Noland,
has been returned to us.

573
01:50:33,335 --> 01:50:35,461
Chuck, welcome home.

574
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:49,142
Just moments ago,
Fred Smith welcomed home Chuck Noland.

575
01:50:49,226 --> 01:50:50,915
How about it, Michelle?

576
01:50:50,916 --> 01:50:52,603
It's such an incredible
and amazing story...

577
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:54,523
to come back from the dead.

578
01:50:54,524 --> 01:50:56,357
Well, it's so amazing that
Smith himself welcomed him back.

579
01:50:56,441 --> 01:51:00,069
And Fred acknowledged that,
"While time waits for no man...

580
01:51:00,154 --> 01:51:03,072
we take time to pause
to honor one of our own."

581
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:05,408
Now, that's an expensive pause.

582
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:15,501
I'm-I'm sorry.
I must be in the wrong place.

583
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:18,337
No, you're in the right place.

584
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:22,758
You probably don't remember me. I actually
did root canal on you about five years ago.

585
01:51:22,843 --> 01:51:25,011
Jim Spaulding referred you.

586
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:28,890
Oh, yeah, yeah.

587
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:35,730
I'm Kelly's husband.

588
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:39,859
Jerry Lovett.

589
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:43,029
Kelly wanted...

590
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:45,031
Kelly wanted to be here...

591
01:51:47,618 --> 01:51:51,537
Look, this is very hard
for everyone.

592
01:51:51,622 --> 01:51:54,207
I can't even imagine
how hard it is for you.

593
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:00,963
Kelly, uh...

594
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:05,509
She's had it rough.

595
01:52:05,594 --> 01:52:08,262
First when she thought
she lost you...

596
01:52:08,347 --> 01:52:10,264
and now dealing
with all of this.

597
01:52:10,349 --> 01:52:13,726
It's-It's confusing.
It's very emotional for her.

598
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:15,728
She's...

599
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:20,942
She's... sort of lost.

600
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:25,613
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

601
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:33,537
Anyway, uh...

602
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:35,539
I'm sorry that...

603
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,849
Okay, people, let's go.

604
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:37,226
Party's over. Let's go home.
Let's go home.

605
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:39,854
You're definitely gonna
have to go down to the DMV.

606
01:53:39,938 --> 01:53:42,481
Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

607
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:44,267
I have to brief this man
on his meetings tomorrow...

608
01:53:44,268 --> 01:53:44,647
I know.

609
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:46,569
With the accountants
and the attorneys, all right?

610
01:53:46,653 --> 01:53:49,155
I will see you bright and early
in the morning.

611
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:53,492
- Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
- Becca, I need to speak to you.

612
01:53:53,577 --> 01:53:57,204
You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.

613
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:59,248
Take care.

614
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:04,295
- Good night.
- Good night.

615
01:54:07,424 --> 01:54:09,842
You got everything
you need? Okay.

616
01:54:09,926 --> 01:54:11,844
Well, if you need anything,
just sign for it...

617
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:14,180
and I'll see you
in the morning.

618
01:54:14,264 --> 01:54:17,058
Get some sleep, okay?
We got another big day tomorrow.

619
01:54:17,142 --> 01:54:19,602
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

620
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:24,523
- Bring you back to life, man.
- Bye, Chuck.

621
01:54:24,608 --> 01:54:26,859
- Take care, now.
- Tomorrow.

622
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:29,153
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

623
01:56:14,009 --> 01:56:15,926
How long are you gonna be, man?

624
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:21,182
Well...

625
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:24,393
- how long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

626
01:56:48,585 --> 01:56:50,628
I'm awake.

627
01:56:50,712 --> 01:56:52,755
I saw your taxi drive up.

628
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:57,259
Get in here out of the rain.

629
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:06,519
I saw you
down at the hub today...

630
01:57:06,603 --> 01:57:08,938
so I know you were down there.

631
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:29,208
Let me get you a towel.

632
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:43,097
They're sleeping.

633
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,061
If you come in,
I'll make you some coffee.

634
01:58:02,534 --> 01:58:04,451
It's a nice house.

635
01:58:04,536 --> 01:58:06,495
Yeah, we got
a nice mortgage too.

636
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:16,922
What's your daughter's name?

637
01:58:17,007 --> 01:58:21,594
Katie.

638
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:28,017
- She's a beautiful little girl.
- She's a handful.

639
01:58:42,324 --> 01:58:44,241
Just let me get
one thing straight here.

640
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:57,463
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

641
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:08,140
Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.
They used to be in Houston.

642
01:59:08,224 --> 01:59:12,353
First they were the Oilers,
and now they're the Titans.

643
01:59:12,437 --> 01:59:15,105
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans?

644
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:17,107
Yeah.

645
01:59:17,192 --> 01:59:19,109
But that's not all.

646
01:59:19,194 --> 01:59:22,154
They went to the Super Bowl
last year.

647
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:24,823
- And I missed that.
- You would've died. It was so exciting.

648
01:59:24,908 --> 01:59:28,452
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard right at the end.

649
01:59:30,872 --> 01:59:34,166
I got whole milk,
2% and nonfat.

650
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:36,502
I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.

651
01:59:37,754 --> 01:59:39,713
That'll do fine.

652
01:59:52,769 --> 01:59:55,020
What happened to you
becoming a professor?

653
01:59:57,023 --> 02:00:00,818
You're not
Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?

654
02:00:03,988 --> 02:00:06,448
When you, um...

655
02:00:06,533 --> 02:00:09,368
When your plane went down...

656
02:00:09,452 --> 02:00:11,704
everything just sort of
got put on hold.

657
02:00:14,582 --> 02:00:17,042
I think about
taking it up again, though.

658
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:31,140
I came out here
to give you this.

659
02:00:32,851 --> 02:00:34,810
Oh, my God.

660
02:00:36,855 --> 02:00:38,814
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

661
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:43,152
And I, uh, I kept the picture.

662
02:00:44,446 --> 02:00:46,447
It was all faded anyway.

663
02:00:47,824 --> 02:00:50,617
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

664
02:00:50,702 --> 02:00:53,787
That's a family heirloom,
and it should stay in your family.

665
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:06,633
That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.

666
02:01:08,845 --> 02:01:11,346
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

667
02:01:11,431 --> 02:01:15,017
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

668
02:01:19,355 --> 02:01:21,690
So here's where
that ship found you.

669
02:01:23,026 --> 02:01:26,195
You drifted about 500 miles.

670
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:28,489
This is where
your island was...

671
02:01:28,573 --> 02:01:31,909
about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.

672
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:35,746
And these are the search grids.

673
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:38,707
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

674
02:01:47,759 --> 02:01:49,885
I never should've
gotten on that plane.

675
02:01:52,222 --> 02:01:54,723
I never should've
gotten out of the car.

676
02:01:58,561 --> 02:02:00,479
I wanna show you something.

677
02:02:02,565 --> 02:02:04,525
Come here.

678
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:16,078
This is... This is our car.

679
02:02:18,456 --> 02:02:20,415
You kept our car.

680
02:02:22,585 --> 02:02:25,879
All right, now, this is weird.

681
02:02:34,347 --> 02:02:36,515
It's a good car.

682
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:38,892
Had a lot of memories
in this car.

683
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:41,603
Two very nice memories.

684
02:02:41,688 --> 02:02:43,772
Oh, that trip
down to the Gulf, yeah.

685
02:02:46,317 --> 02:02:48,235
So, can I drive it?

686
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:50,279
It's your car.

687
02:02:57,954 --> 02:03:01,123
That's good, 'cause my...
my taxi's gone.

688
02:03:07,255 --> 02:03:09,590
Um...

689
02:03:09,674 --> 02:03:11,633
Let me get some stuff
out of the back.

690
02:03:34,115 --> 02:03:36,533
You think you're gonna
have more kids?

691
02:03:36,618 --> 02:03:38,535
I don't know.

692
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:41,455
It's kind of confusing
right now.

693
02:03:41,539 --> 02:03:44,249
Well, you should.

694
02:03:44,334 --> 02:03:46,335
I mean, really, you should.

695
02:03:48,755 --> 02:03:50,672
I would.

696
02:03:52,842 --> 02:03:54,760
So, what now?

697
02:03:57,805 --> 02:03:59,723
I don't know.

698
02:04:02,226 --> 02:04:04,186
I really don't know.

699
02:04:16,866 --> 02:04:18,825
You said you'd be right back.

700
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,958
I'm so sorry.

701
02:04:27,877 --> 02:04:29,836
Me too.

702
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:40,657
Chuck!

703
02:05:44,537 --> 02:05:49,291
Chuck!

704
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:08,477
I always knew you were alive.

705
02:06:08,561 --> 02:06:11,229
I knew it.

706
02:06:11,314 --> 02:06:13,440
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that...

707
02:06:13,524 --> 02:06:15,567
that I had to let you go.

708
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:19,863
I love you.

709
02:06:19,947 --> 02:06:21,823
You're the love of my life.

710
02:06:24,368 --> 02:06:26,328
I love you too, Kelly.

711
02:06:27,914 --> 02:06:29,831
More than you'll ever know.

712
02:07:30,852 --> 02:07:32,769
Chuck?

713
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:42,487
You have to go home.

714
02:08:30,786 --> 02:08:32,829
We both had done
the math, and...

715
02:08:35,249 --> 02:08:37,626
Kelly added it all up.

716
02:08:39,295 --> 02:08:41,213
She knew she had to let me go.

717
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:45,675
I added it up, knew that I'd...

718
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:47,677
I'd lost her.

719
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:51,806
'Cause I was never gonna
get off that island.

720
02:08:54,810 --> 02:08:57,395
I was gonna die there...

721
02:08:57,480 --> 02:08:59,439
totally alone.

722
02:09:05,821 --> 02:09:08,698
I mean, I was gonna get sick or I was
gonna get injured or something.

723
02:09:12,828 --> 02:09:14,788
The only choice I had...

724
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:19,751
the only thing
I could control...

725
02:09:21,837 --> 02:09:25,298
was when and how...

726
02:09:25,383 --> 02:09:27,300
and where
that was gonna happen.

727
02:09:27,385 --> 02:09:31,888
So... I made a rope.

728
02:09:34,934 --> 02:09:37,852
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

729
02:09:41,399 --> 02:09:43,525
But I had to test it, you know?

730
02:09:43,609 --> 02:09:46,528
Of course. You know me.

731
02:09:48,489 --> 02:09:50,407
And the weight of the log...

732
02:09:50,491 --> 02:09:53,785
snapped the limb of the tree.

733
02:09:53,869 --> 02:09:55,787
So I-I...

734
02:09:55,871 --> 02:09:58,498
I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

735
02:09:58,582 --> 02:10:01,543
I had power over nothing.

736
02:10:10,011 --> 02:10:13,555
And that's when this feeling came over me
like a warm blanket.

737
02:10:17,601 --> 02:10:19,644
I knew...

738
02:10:19,729 --> 02:10:22,022
somehow...

739
02:10:22,106 --> 02:10:24,441
that I had to stay alive.

740
02:10:26,068 --> 02:10:27,986
Somehow.

741
02:10:29,071 --> 02:10:31,364
I had to keep breathing...

742
02:10:33,909 --> 02:10:35,994
even though there was
no reason to hope.

743
02:10:38,122 --> 02:10:41,833
And all my logic said that I would never
see this place again.

744
02:10:46,672 --> 02:10:49,507
So that's what I did.

745
02:10:49,592 --> 02:10:52,135
I stayed alive.

746
02:10:52,219 --> 02:10:54,137
I kept breathing.

747
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:58,641
And then one day
that logic was proven all wrong...

748
02:10:58,726 --> 02:11:00,643
because the tide...

749
02:11:02,772 --> 02:11:05,273
came in, gave me a sail.

750
02:11:09,945 --> 02:11:11,905
And now, here I am.

751
02:11:15,242 --> 02:11:18,203
I'm back...

752
02:11:18,287 --> 02:11:20,789
in Memphis, talking to you.

753
02:11:22,917 --> 02:11:25,460
I have ice in my glass.

754
02:11:32,134 --> 02:11:34,511
And I've lost her
all over again.

755
02:11:42,311 --> 02:11:44,771
I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly.

756
02:11:49,902 --> 02:11:53,321
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

757
02:12:00,496 --> 02:12:02,622
And I know
what I have to do now.

758
02:12:05,501 --> 02:12:07,585
I gotta keep breathing.

759
02:12:10,214 --> 02:12:12,715
Because tomorrow,
the sun will rise.

760
02:12:13,968 --> 02:12:16,469
Who knows what the tide
could bring?

761
02:13:22,077 --> 02:13:24,037
Hello!

762
02:13:28,417 --> 02:13:30,376
Hello!

763
02:13:38,093 --> 02:13:40,261
FedEx!

764
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:50,957
- You look lost.
- I do?

765
02:14:51,041 --> 02:14:53,334
Where are you headed?

766
02:14:57,006 --> 02:14:58,965
Well, I was just about
to figure that out.

767
02:15:00,634 --> 02:15:02,927
Well, that's 83 South.

768
02:15:03,012 --> 02:15:07,056
And this road here will
hook you up with I-40 East.

769
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:09,392
If you turn right...

770
02:15:09,476 --> 02:15:13,146
that'll take you to
Amarillo, Flagstaff...

771
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:15,189
California.

772
02:15:16,358 --> 02:15:18,276
And if you head back
that direction...

773
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:21,362
you'll find a whole lotta nothin'
all the way to Canada.

774
02:15:23,407 --> 02:15:25,325
I got it.

775
02:15:25,409 --> 02:15:27,619
All right, then.

776
02:15:30,164 --> 02:15:32,081
Good luck, cowboy.

777
02:15:32,166 --> 02:15:34,000
Thank you.
