00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

6
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,500
Kohza!

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,790
Toto-ojisan!

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,780
Vivi!

9
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,030
Oi!

10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,440
Pell!

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,530
Hey, Pell.

12
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,350
Yes?

13
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,550
Why do you practice fencing everyday?

14
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,200
Because I'm a guardian.

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,850
In order to protect this country,

16
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,220
I need to become stronger.

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,220
Who are you going to fight?

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,180
Well...

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,800
It's more about protecting than fighting.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,180
Is it different?

21
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,680
The intention is different.

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,810
That's strange.

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,250
Papa.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,090
Soon I will reach the country.

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,660
Don't be deceived.

26
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,520
That man is not the country's hero.

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,240
He's trying to steal Arabasta.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,410
Please don't do anything rash!

29
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,700
What?

30
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,540
What is it?

31
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,950
Okama (gay) way

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,150
We caught an Okama!

33
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,350
What're you doing to Carue?!

34
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,440
There's no bait left...

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,560
You just ate a while ago, didn't you?!!

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,050
But...

37
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,940
Really, swan, swan...

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,960
To think, I was rescued by a pirate crew that I don't even know.

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,230
This favor, I shall never forget it.

40
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,850
We didn't catch you on purpose.

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,130
What're you doing in a place like this?

42
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,770
It's a long story.

43
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,630
Then, never mind.

44
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,920
Huh?

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,130
You're so cute!

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,170
I really like you.

47
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,130
Weird man.

48
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,530
Even so, at the moment I fell into the sea,

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,450
I thought I was done for.

50
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,740
You can't swim?

51
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,400
That's right, I'm a hammer.

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,290
Are you a Devil's Fruit user?

53
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,100
That's correct.

54
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,270
I'm a rarity in this world.

55
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,950
I ate the Devil's Fruit!

56
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,930
What's that, not very surprised...

57
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,430
You're nothing unusual.

58
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,590
You're so full of yourself.

59
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,580
There are abilities which you might not know.

60
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,560
Bastard! What you want is to provoke Nami-san, right?!

61
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,080
Since I've already seen so many, there's nothing that can surprise me now.

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,140
Fine, then.

63
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,200
I'll show you my amusing way of thanking.

64
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,160
Alright! Alright! Showâ€¦ usâ€¦

65
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,080
Oi!

66
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,800
What're you...

67
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,620
No way.

68
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,840
Hey you! What're you doing?!

69
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,480
Wait.

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,390
I told you it was amusing.

71
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,350
It's no joke.

72
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,430
It's me!

73
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,360
Do I look like you?

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,270
Surprised?

75
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,400
This is the ability of the mane mane fruit I ate.

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,400
mane: mimicry

77
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,320
Amazing!

78
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,780
But if I touch myself with my left handâ€¦

79
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,700
Look! I'm back to normal.

80
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,900
The voice too...

81
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,050
Even the complexion...

82
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,970
To be honest.

83
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,710
The truth is...

84
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,580
It isn't really necessary to hit...

85
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,320
Don't touch me.

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,040
Well, it's okay.

87
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,170
But if I...

88
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,220
With my right hand...

89
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,880
Touch the face of my partner...

90
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,800
Like this, I can...

91
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,250
Imitate anyone.

92
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,370
My body too.

93
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,240
Stop it!

94
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,110
Ouch!

95
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,410
You're amazing!

96
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,320
Amazing!

97
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,280
Furthermore, I can use my memory ability.

98
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,670
The faces...

99
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,630
I touched...

100
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,730
Before...

101
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,790
I definitely...

102
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,860
Won't...

103
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,750
Forget.

104
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,910
How is it?

105
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,580
My hidden talent.

106
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,100
So cool!

107
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,000
It's no joke!

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
Do whatever you want...

109
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,230
Hey, isn't that your ship?

110
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,300
Oh? Time to part already?

111
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,480
Don't be sad!

112
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,770
Farewells are natural things.

113
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,400
But, just don't forget this...

114
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,120
In friendship...

115
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,860
The time we've known each other doesn't matter!

116
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,570
Let's meet again!

117
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,620
Well, let's go guys!

118
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,280
Yes! Bon Kurei-sama!

119
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,280
Bon: Festival of the Dead; Kure: Year End

120
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,740
Eh?!

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,080
Bon Kurei?

122
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:13,950
Vivi?

123
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,160
Crocodile's subordinate!

124
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,460
Didn't you recognize his face?

125
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,920
I've never met him until now.

126
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,680
When he looked back into his memory,

127
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
My father's face was there.

128
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,160
Why my father's face...

129
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,920
For example, if you disguise yourself as a kingâ€¦

130
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,890
You can do some bad thingsâ€¦

131
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,810
Dance powderâ€¦ that guyâ€¦

132
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,570
What is that?

133
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,910
A powder that can make artificial rainfall.

134
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,260
The World Government prohibited its production.

135
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,140
That's a useful powderâ€¦

136
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,140
Why not use it?

137
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,280
Dance powder, right?

138
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,680
It makes clouds that aren't ready for rainfallâ€¦

139
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,940
Artificially grow into maturity in order to make it rain.

140
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,600
It steals the rain from neighboring countries.

141
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,800
And because of the frequent disputes between themâ€¦

142
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,720
The World Government had to prohibit it, huh?

143
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,530
2 years ago,

144
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,310
A large quantity of dance powder arrived to the port city of Arabasta, Nanohana.

145
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,660
At that time, except for Alubarna where the king lives,

146
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,590
Abnormal incidents of rain not falling occurred.

147
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,030
So they got suspicious of the king.

148
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,700
As if he used that powder to posses the rain.

149
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,540
Vivi!

150
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,730
Then, your father is a bad guy!

151
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,740
Idiot! He was framed!

152
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,600
Vivi's father wouldn't do such a thing.

153
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,180
He wouldn't.

154
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,020
He wouldn't.

155
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,990
It's as Sanji-san says.

156
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,710
My father isn't an egoistical person, so something must have happened.

157
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,140
At the port, the appearance of the person receiving the cargo was witnessed,

158
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,550
And judging by the hat he was wearing...

159
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,420
The identity of the man who was transporting the dance powder to the palace is now very clear.

160
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,260
I see, that guy was disguised as the king.

161
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,100
We let such a troublesome guy get away.

162
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,190
Everything was the plan of Crocodile, his organization's boss.

163
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,190
As he expected, it caused rebellion.

164
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,400
I see.

165
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,170
Make the royal army and the rebel army clash,

166
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,570
So when both are weakened, he'll steal the throne.

167
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,330
He disguises himself as the country's hero.

168
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,440
He stole the royal family's trust, the rain,

169
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,330
Even people's lives, and created disorder in Arabasta!

170
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,130
That's Crocodile!

171
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,050
Amazing!

172
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,000
Crocodile! Crocodile!

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,850
Sir Crocodile!

174
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,620
The Protector God of Arabasta!

175
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,680
The King of the Desert!

176
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,280
Crocodile! Crocodile!

177
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,410
Shut up, you ignorant fools!

178
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,510
Even if you say that, you always come and rescue us.

179
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,870
He's fantastic!

180
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,280
Well, call it whatever you want.

181
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,110
Your Majesty, Crocodile-sama has arrived.

182
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,930
It's a present, Mr. Cobra.

183
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,640
We always receive your help.

184
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,540
It's fine.

185
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,540
The royal army takes care of the rebel army. I take care of pirates.

186
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,980
Well, I'll leave the disposal of this trash to you.

187
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,690
By the way,

188
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,250
I heard the rebel army was making a disturbance.

189
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,450
What do you plan to do?

190
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,210
The country is the people.

191
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,910
If they intend to come and attack us, there's nothing to do.

192
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,850
I see.

193
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,480
We'll meet again before long.

194
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,630
Anyway, this time there will be too many enigmas.

195
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,260
I see.

196
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,720
If we use this, there's no reason to distrust our nakama.

197
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,070
Using a double mark, huh?

198
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,410
It's a very clever strategy.

199
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,110
Could it be that you're the okama bastard?

200
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,790
I'll slice you up! Bastard!

201
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,720
Oh, it's Zoro.

202
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,770
So it's Zoro...

203
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,230
Yosh!

204
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,670
From now on, if anything happens,

205
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,540
Show this on your left arm!

206
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,070
Yeah!

207
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,260
It's the mark of nakama!

208
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,120
Let's land!

209
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,120
At Arabasta!

210
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,830
Yeah!

211
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,050
Papa.

212
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll definitely stop the rebel army.

213
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,980
Episode of Arabasta

214
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,980
The Desert Princess and the Pirates.

215
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,630
I'm thirsty...

216
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,220
You sure are evil...

217
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,620
Stealing our precious water and food.

218
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,270
Soon we'll arrive at the rebel army headquarters in Yuba.

219
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,630
But, will we really be okay?

220
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,430
A lot of blood is going to my head...

221
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,040
It's alright.

222
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,380
We'll surely manage to persuade them.

223
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,650
This is horrible.

224
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,440
It's covered with sand...

225
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,050
Where's the water?

226
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,180
Hey, water.

227
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,810
Wasn't there an oasis here?

228
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,810
Where are you water?

229
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,260
Water...

230
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,770
The sand has covered the earth...

231
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,720
Someone's there.

232
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,020
Eh? Really?

233
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,930
Travelers, right?

234
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,500
A journey in the desert is tiring, isn't it?

235
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,360
Sorry, this town is all dried up.

236
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,330
Um...

237
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,180
We heard the rebel army was in this town so...

238
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
You!

239
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,790
Could it be that you people want to join the rebel army!

240
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,400
They're no longer in this town.

241
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,040
No way!

242
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,500
What's going on, Vivi?

243
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,970
You just said Vivi...

244
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,970
Umm...I...

245
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,080
Oi, Ossan!

246
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,640
Vivi is not the princess!

247
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,910
Don't say it!

248
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,250
Is that you Vivi-chan?

249
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,740
Am I right?

250
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,900
You're alive, I'm glad!

251
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,750
It's me.

252
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,120
Don't you recognize me?

253
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,370
Toto-ojisan?

254
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,030
That's right!

255
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,750
No way!

256
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,900
You've becomeâ€¦ so thinâ€¦

257
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,420
What? It's no big deal.

258
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,200
I still believe in Vivi-chan and His Majesty.

259
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,920
That man is definitely not the type that will betray the country.

260
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,770
Am I right?

261
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,320
I'm counting on you, Toto.

262
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,880
I'll make sure Yuba becomes a prosperous town with abundant greenery.

263
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,100
We'll build an amazing town,

264
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,350
And make this country much more prosperous.

265
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,360
See you, Vivi.

266
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,340
Don't forget the pride of the Suna Suna Clan you got as sub-leader, and become a fine princess!

267
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,340
Suna: Sand

268
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,730
Yes, Leader.

269
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,730
It's a promise!

270
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,710
See ya!

271
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,240
Rebellion is such a foolish thing.

272
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,730
I tried to stop him many times, and yet...

273
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,250
When they heard a rumor that the royal army was being used to invade...

274
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,530
They went towards Nanohana.

275
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,910
The royal army is in Nanohana?

276
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,660
Toto-ojisan, when was that?

277
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,170
About 5 hours ago.

278
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,000
We're too late.

279
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,640
What a terrible situation.

280
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,180
But, where'd the royal army go?

281
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,300
We came here hoping we might encounter them...

282
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,370
This isn't the time to talk.

283
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,020
Let's help everyone in town.

284
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,000
Stay calm.

285
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,860
Don't push the ones in front.

286
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,430
To the west side of town!

287
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,570
Run into the wind!

288
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,340
Hang in there.

289
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,610
There's still more to save.

290
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:51,950
Be strong.

291
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,790
The king... ordered to... burn the town...

292
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,910
Don't talk!

293
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,880
Oi! Kid, are you alright?

294
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,140
Damn! Even the kids!

295
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,110
Damn Cobra!

296
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,760
His degradation has gone this far.

297
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,720
At this rate, only death awaits Arabasta!

298
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,700
Kohza!

299
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,610
Contact everyone...

300
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,290
Kohza, then...

301
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,420
Yeah.

302
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,060
We'll finish this country.

303
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,970
The current Arabasta is already dead!

304
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,610
This is the last battle!

305
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,270
We'll invade Alubarna!

306
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,620
Operation Utopia.

307
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,880
The first step was completed nicely but,

308
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,870
The arrival of Princess Vivi and the Strawhats to this place was not part of the calculations.

309
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,760
But, that's not a big problem.

310
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:55,010
Now, we have to prevent the princess and the young leader of the rebel army, Kohza, from making contact.

311
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,180
Then, we'll move on to the second step.

312
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,140
Good luck.

313
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,060
It's almost time.

314
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,390
By tomorrow, the Kingdom of Arabasta will be mine.

315
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,280
We'll change it into our Utopia.

316
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,980
The world's most terrifying ancient weapon...

317
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,950
Once I have Pluton in my hands, this will become a great military country.

318
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,770
Kohza and the others are already at their limits...

319
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,870
They're even ready to die.

320
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,130
I beg you Vivi-chan, please stop those fools.

321
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,590
Toto-ojisan, don't worry.

322
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,090
Vivi-chan.

323
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,680
We'll definitely stop the rebellion.

324
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,350
Vivi...

325
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,870
Well then, we are leaving, Toto-ojisan.

326
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,490
Yes.

327
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,200
Please, take this with you.

328
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,240
Oh! Water!

329
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,210
Water!

330
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,470
Can there really be water in such a dried up place?

331
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,810
Yes, after all, Yuba won't lose to some sand.

332
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,780
I excavated it yesterday after one week of trying.

333
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,950
It's genuine Yuba water.

334
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,460
Such precious water.

335
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Thank you!

336
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,880
I will treasure it.

337
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,810
See ya!

338
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,870
Dried up-ossan.

339
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,820
What's wrong, Luffy?

340
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,090
Luffy-san?

341
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,030
I quit.

342
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,980
What do you mean by "I quit"?

343
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,570
You know, we have no time for your jokes.

344
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,110
We're going to stop the rebel army, right?

345
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,750
Of course.

346
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,550
It's pointless.

347
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,450
What was that?!

348
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,900
Vivi.

349
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,580
I'm gonna kick Crocodile's ass.

350
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,200
If we stop the rebels, will Crocodile stop?

351
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,670
Well...

352
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,770
This guy... once in a while has a point.

353
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,760
Even though it's Luffy.

354
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,550
You don't want anyone to die in this battle.

355
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,020
The country's people, us, everyone.

356
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,180
Aren't you being too naÃ¯ve?

357
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,440
Shouldn't I think that way?

358
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,370
What's wrong with not wanting people to die?

359
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,610
People die.

360
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,240
Stop talking that way!

361
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,180
If you say it again, I won't forgive you!

362
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,080
The royal army, the rebel army, and the people of this country haven't done anything bad.

363
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,790
Why can't I wish for people not to die?

364
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,000
Then, why are you risking your life?!

365
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,210
Oi! You're over doing it!

366
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,210
Bastard!

367
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,980
After seeing this country, we know what's the most important thing to do...

368
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,710
What is it?!

369
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,060
We all know!

370
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,430
Do you think that risking your life is enough?

371
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,690
Then, what else shall I risk?!

372
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,580
Is there anything else...?

373
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,710
Is there anything else I can risk?!

374
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,660
I don't have anything...

375
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,240
Try risking our lives together!

376
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,790
We're nakama!

377
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,690
Whatâ€¦ the tears came out.

378
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,150
The truth is, if you're the one suffering the most.

379
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,110
I will kick those guys' asses.

380
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,790
Show us.

381
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,020
Crocodile's whereabouts.

382
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,160
The royal army burnt down Nanohana?

383
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Such order was never given.

384
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,920
It might be a trap from the rebel army.

385
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,950
Assemble the entire army at once.

386
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,380
Chaka, gather the officers.

387
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,190
Assemble a battle formation.

388
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,080
Pell, fly and inspect the enemy formation.

389
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,840
Is that clear?

390
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,800
We'll attack the rebel army.

391
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,760
Resist to the very end!

392
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,940
What're you doing?

393
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,890
Yes!

394
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,590
With this, they'll be confused.

395
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,560
Mission accomplished.

396
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,480
Amazing, so fast!

397
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,830
Matsuge: Eyelashes

398
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,830
Matsuge says that, since he was born in this area, he has a lot of friends around here.

399
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,950
T-thank you, Matsuge.

400
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,720
Luffy-san.

401
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,130
Thank you.  I don't know how to repay you for helping me make this important decision.

402
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,780
Is that so?

403
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,340
Give me food.

404
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,880
If I beat Crocodile, give me some food to die for.

405
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,340
Yes.

406
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,640
Just you wait.

407
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,860
Cro-co-di-le!

408
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,580
What's this?

409
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,980
Stop Chopper!

410
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,600
Got it.

411
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,300
Vivi!

412
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,460
Did you call for me, Strawhat Luffy?

413
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,460
Get away from Vivi!

414
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,850
Alright!

415
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,670
So you're Crocodile?!

416
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,590
Don't shout.

417
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,720
Vivi-sama, why're you here?

418
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,180
Pell!

419
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,740
Bastard!

420
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,160
What did you do?!

421
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,900
Seis Fleur.

422
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,900
Seis Fleur: Six Flower

423
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,410
Clutch.

424
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,290
Pell!

425
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,120
The kingdom's best warrior isn't a big deal.

426
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,580
What are these guys?

427
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,800
It's useless.

428
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,030
The party has already begun.

429
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,630
Isn't that right, Miss All Sunday?

430
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,340
Yes.

431
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,800
It can't be...

432
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,260
To Alubarna!

433
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,370
The rebel army got weapons from a merchant ship in Nanohana...

434
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,730
And with those, they began the attack.

435
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,660
And so, the royal army intends to start a full scale attack.

436
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,030
We will protect Arabasta!

437
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,990
Doesn't it make you cry?

438
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,450
Their love for this country will be the thing that destroys it.

439
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,920
It's not too late yet...

440
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,450
If I manage to get to the palace at Alubarna before the rebel army...

441
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,420
We might stop this conflict.

442
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,170
What a guy...

443
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,020
The word "traitor" describes this guy perfectly.

444
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,640
Where's Luffy?

445
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,640
Zoro!

446
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,610
You guys go ahead.

447
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,200
I'll take care of this!

448
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,110
Strawhat...

449
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,530
Hurry up and leave!

450
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,260
Chopper.

451
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,990
Go, hurry!

452
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,580
Are you stupid?

453
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,180
Like I'll let you leave without...

454
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,580
Your opponent is over here!

455
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,790
Brat...

456
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,840
So they escaped after all.

457
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,190
Luffy-san!

458
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,850
Vivi, he'll be fine.

459
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,350
So far, once Luffy picks his opponent, there's no one that has gotten away unharmed.

460
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,240
Listen, Vivi.

461
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,810
He will keep Crocodile busy.

462
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,360
Gomu Gomu no

463
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,110
Pistol

464
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,190
Crocodile will be defeated by him.

465
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,260
The instant the rebel army started to advance...

466
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,600
This country's time limit had been decided.

467
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,120
And if you are the only hope for stopping them...

468
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,290
We'll keep you alive no matter what.

469
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,750
Gatling

470
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,210
From here on, anything that happens to anyone here...

471
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,590
Doesn't matter.

472
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,590
Bazooka

473
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,560
It's like the marimo says.

474
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,180
You won't have to think of fighting alone anymore.

475
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,150
Vi-Vi-Vivivi... you don't have to worry...

476
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,040
Y-you can count on me...

477
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,430
Luffy-san.

478
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,350
I'll be waiting in Alubarna.

479
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,010
Damn it...

480
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,640
I can't hit him at all.

481
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,100
He keeps dissolving!

482
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,820
Our pirate levels are too different, Strawhat Luffy.

483
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,750
Play time is over.

484
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,370
Desert Espada

485
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,370
Espada: Sword

486
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,090
Eh? The desert was cut?!

487
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,880
Impressive, you saw through it.

488
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,580
Desert Girasol

489
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,580
Girasol: Sunflower

490
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,720
What? What? What?

491
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,010
Haven't you heard of quicksand?

492
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,020
There's no need for a gravestone, it's a desert coffin.

493
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,280
You're now being dragged into an underground waterway.

494
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,940
There's no one in this world that can match me in a desert battle.

495
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,100
Like I'm gonna get buried alive by some sand.

496
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,860
Gomu Gomu no

497
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,910
Bazooka

498
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,990
Gomu Gomu no

499
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,220
Stamp

500
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,200
It's no use.

501
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,040
Barehand.

502
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,550
My leg turned into a mummy!

503
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,340
It's because the sand has absorbed your moisture.

504
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,190
You gotta be kidding.

505
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,550
That's right!

506
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,260
Restored!

507
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,340
Useless.

508
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,510
It's not useless!

509
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,150
The dried up-ossan dug this water, it's very precious water!

510
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,650
Ossan said so!

511
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,150
Yuba won't lose to just some sand!

512
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,830
Who do you think I am?

513
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,470
There are many rookies like youâ€¦

514
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,250
There're many of them, Strawhat Luffy...

515
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,680
On this Grand Line.

516
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,660
It can't be...

517
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,610
He's still alive...

518
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,950
It's painful, isn't it?

519
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,000
But, you'll soon be at peace.

520
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,030
What a waste of time.

521
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,790
Princess Vivi is heading to Alubarna,

522
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,540
Contact the agents.

523
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,170
I understand.

524
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,090
Why do you fight?

525
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,570
You people who hold the name "D"...

526
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,640
Vivi, how much further until we reach the palace?

527
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,810
Maybe about 50 km.

528
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,150
Still that much?

529
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,850
We're not gonna make it...

530
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,240
Can't we speed up, Hasami-kun?

531
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,240
Hasami: Scissors

532
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,770
That's right!

533
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,280
Hasami really likes dancers.

534
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,460
Is this fine?

535
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,880
He's looking this way.

536
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,760
We accelerated!

537
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,770
Pervert Power!

538
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,530
Nami-swan!

539
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,220
Controlling two idiots with the same trick.

540
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,140
If we keep going this fast, we might be able to do something.

541
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,700
However, don't get too confident yet.

542
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,350
Yeah.

543
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,190
The king disappeared, you say?!

544
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,700
I looked all over the palace, but he's nowhere!

545
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,580
Besides, we've confirmed the rebel army, about 20 km to the south.

546
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,500
Defend all the gates!

547
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,570
Don't let them take even one step into this town.

548
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:10,790
Yes!

549
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,640
Since they're coming here from Yuba...

550
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,510
If we stick to the west gate, there's no way we won't notice them.

551
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,080
They plan on getting here before the rebel army.

552
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,450
Do they think they can stop them?

553
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,470
Geez.

554
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,570
They.. are... coming...

555
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,570
What?

556
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,880
Say it faster! You slow daruma!

557
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,880
daruma: Japanese tumbling doll

558
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,030
My hip!

559
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,110
A moving crab...

560
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,770
W-with six people!

561
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,030
Don't bother with the others, our target is only Vivi.

562
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,410
"Only" you say?

563
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,490
Then you...

564
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,450
Which one is Vivi, I can't tell the difference.

565
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,270
These guys...

566
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,210
They're using the same mantle!

567
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,160
This is so confusing!

568
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,680
We'll take care of those two!

569
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,100
Let's go Mr. 4!

570
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,750
Y-e-s...

571
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,570
They split again!

572
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,920
They're planning on getting inside separately.

573
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,680
After them.

574
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,050
Then I...

575
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,680
Un... Deux...

576
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,650
You're not getting away!

577
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,820
Thank you, everyone.

578
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,410
Is it okay that you came all this way?

579
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,540
You guys made the correct choice,

580
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,260
I'm Princess Vivi.

581
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,470
What're you saying...

582
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,390
I told you.

583
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,630
I'm the real Vivi!

584
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,800
Good job on getting this far.

585
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,260
Now, let's show them our true face!

586
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,280
It's a shame...

587
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,530
You fail!

588
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,430
The Princess Vivi...

589
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,140
Where'd she go?!

590
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,600
I'll kill you!

591
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,730
I'm sorry!

592
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,160
The rebel army should be coming soon.

593
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,570
Leader...

594
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,100
Listen to what I have to say...

595
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,610
Everyone!

596
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,380
Just a little more to break through the south gate!

597
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,040
Next, we will attack from inside the front gate.

598
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,320
Get ready!

599
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,230
Please stop!

600
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,240
Rebel army!

601
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,130
This battle was planned!

602
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,270
What was that?

603
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,700
With this, the visibility...

604
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,850
What a foolish thing to do...

605
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,100
The royal army?

606
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,200
I haven't given the order to fire yet!

607
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,930
I-I'm really sorry...

608
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,520
My hand slipped...

609
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,480
Don't act on your own!

610
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,540
Do not falter! Advance!

611
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,700
It's just sand dust!

612
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,800
Stop!

613
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,150
Everyone! Wait!

614
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,380
We're doing this for the country!

615
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,140
The king won't be forgiven!

616
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,810
Leader!

617
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,620
Was it my imagination?

618
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,700
Leader?

619
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,020
Chaka-sama, your orders!

620
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,560
Open fire!

621
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,810
Shoot!

622
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,610
Don't let them get inside!

623
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,330
Don't falter!

624
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,860
Attack Alubarna!

625
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,490
Reinforce the protection of the south gate.

626
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:43,890
Carue!

627
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,440
You covered me.

628
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,070
I'm sorry...

629
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,240
Even thought we got here, the rebellion started.

630
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,860
But I'll stop them.

631
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,490
No matter how many times I get rejected.

632
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,820
Just like I learned on the ship, I can't give up.

633
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,840
Usopp!

634
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,170
Santouryuu

635
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,230
Ushibari

636
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,230
Ushibari: Bull Horns

637
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,610
Stinger

638
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,000
Step

639
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,470
At this rate, we won't settle it.

640
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,160
I got it now!

641
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,660
I'm gonna get really serious now!

642
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,540
Try it.

643
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,740
Are you really alright?

644
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,590
Okay, but don't push yourself.

645
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,060
We can't search for Kohza within this fray.

646
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,620
The fight has only started in this place...

647
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,550
Let's go to the palace to see Chaka!

648
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,910
Carue?!

649
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,040
Carue!

650
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,470
I understand.

651
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,350
You are...

652
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,730
Please take care of Carue!

653
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,210
That idio-! Is he your captain?!

654
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,180
He was killed by the Boss.

655
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,310
He's no pirate king.

656
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,830
Geez, I'm glad he's dead.

657
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,160
He was an idiot that didn't know who he was dealing with.

658
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,580
You'll die too, Long-nose!

659
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,670
Listen, Chopper!

660
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,070
For a man!

661
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,260
Mogurazuka Highway

662
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,260
Mogurazuka: Molehill

663
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,030
4 Ton Bat position!

664
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,730
Here we go,

665
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,770
Mogurazuka...

666
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,330
Yonban Kousaten!

667
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,330
Yonban Kousaten: Intersection No. 4

668
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,980
Usopp!

669
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,360
Bastards!

670
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,020
You...!

671
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,770
No matter who the enemy is...

672
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,810
There's a time when you must fight...

673
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,880
You still...!

674
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,290
That time is... when someone makes fun of the dream of a nakama.

675
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,960
Luffy can't be dead.

676
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,010
Because he'll definitely become the Pirate King!

677
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,720
Don't you dare make fun of that!

678
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,860
One more time.

679
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,630
Take position!

680
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,690
Like I'd let you do that!

681
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,420
Chopper, get behind me!

682
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,230
Got it!

683
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,360
Take this!

684
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,880
Hissatsu!

685
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:24,680
Here we go

686
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,590
Mogurazuka

687
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,180
Kemuri Boshi

688
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,180
Kemuri Boshi: Smoke Star

689
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:33,010
I'll leave it to you, Chopper!

690
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,750
That kid took off his shoes!

691
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,950
What?!

692
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,710
Mogurazuka Yonban Kousaten!

693
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,490
W-wait! It's me!

694
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,080
Idio-! Sto...

695
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,910
Hissatsu

696
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,120
UsoCho

697
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,110
UsoCho: Usopp & Chopper

698
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,330
Hammer Comet

699
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,260
Even you doubt Papa, Leader?

700
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,570
Go back, someone will hear you.

701
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,350
Wait.

702
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,810
I'll definitely prove it to you.

703
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,780
So please, stop the fight!

704
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,740
Vivi!

705
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,530
Are you alright, Kohza?

706
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,370
Now, I will enter the palace to demand Cobra's surrender.

707
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,890
Don't be foolish.

708
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,750
The royal army's main force is surrounding the palace.

709
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,470
It isn't necessary for you to go there alone!

710
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,720
It's too late...

711
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,430
Cover me.

712
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,140
Oi! Kohza!

713
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,990
You!

714
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,100
The townspeople must hurry up and take refuge.

715
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,780
Leave this town at once!

716
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,020
Are you listening, woman?

717
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,170
Vivi-sama?

718
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,190
Vivi-sama!

719
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,680
Please take me to where Chaka is.

720
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,400
There's something I need to discuss with him.

721
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,420
Make them retreat!

722
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,960
Fight them back!

723
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,220
Don't falter!

724
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,920
Advance!

725
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:03,850
You seem to be nothing more than words, right?

726
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,060
You... damn... okama bastard...

727
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,320
Stop messing...

728
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
Around.

729
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,360
Damn... so cute...

730
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,080
But, this country is really hot...

731
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,410
I feel like getting rid of these clothes

732
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,260
Need a hand?!

733
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,370
Okama Chop

734
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,000
My eyes!

735
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,310
It's about time...

736
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,100
To end this!

737
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,300
Okama Kenpou

738
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,370
That day of summer...

739
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,770
Memories

740
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,390
You... could it be...

741
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,650
Joue

742
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,650
Joue: Cheek

743
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,200
Shot

744
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,860
I've seen through the mane mane fruit.

745
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,400
What?

746
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,740
In the moment before you attack me, you're forced to turn back into an okama.

747
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,950
As long as you're Nami-san, you can't use your kenpou, right?

748
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,960
Sign: Bull's-eye

749
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,040
Eh? I can't hear you at all!

750
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,420
I got the correct answer, didn't I?

751
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,020
So what?!

752
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,840
Let me show you, the okama kenpou...

753
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,370
Prima!

754
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,970
Un...

755
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,110
Deux...

756
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,180
Longe.

757
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,180
Longe: Loin

758
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,460
Tendron.

759
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,460
Tendron: Collar

760
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,800
Cuisseau

761
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,800
Cuisseau: Thigh

762
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,270
Un... Deux... Trois

763
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,700
Jarret

764
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,700
Jarret: Shank

765
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,080
Un... Deux... Trois

766
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,500
Bombardier Arabesque

767
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,490
Veau Shot

768
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,490
Veau: Veal

769
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,550
There's quite a number of broken bones again.

770
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,520
Protect Alubarna!

771
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,360
Capture Sir Crocodile?

772
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,730
If only everyone could see me for a few seconds...

773
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,740
I might be able to do something.

774
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,240
Destroy...

775
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,990
This palace!

776
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,020
What're you saying, Princess?

777
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,770
Have you lost your mind?

778
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,110
Vivi-sama, if we do something like that...

779
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,870
If we do something like that, what?

780
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,380
This country will be finished?

781
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,420
You're wrong.

782
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,970
They said,

783
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,190
This is only the beginning...

784
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:14,970
Of the country!

785
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:17,930
Listen...

786
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,060
The country is the people.

787
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,870
Vivi-sama.

788
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,760
As you wish.

789
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,390
Soldiers.

790
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,200
Set all the gathered gunpowder around the palace base!

791
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,450
Impossible.

792
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,480
They actually intend to do it...

793
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,010
A royal palace that has 4000 years of history.

794
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,030
If we don't gain something from this solution...

795
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,780
It's okay, I'm aware of it.

796
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,920
You won't have any other way to counter the rebel army.

797
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,630
I'm sorry, the country is in an emergency situation.

798
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,550
However, it isn't over yet.

799
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,490
Even if we manage to stop this rebellion,

800
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,910
As long as Crocodile is alive, this country will not have peace.

801
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,740
This bothers me.

802
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,690
Isn't this a dangerous thing to do?

803
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,590
Soon this place will become my house.

804
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,400
Crocodile!

805
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,820
Well, well, if it isn't the princess.

806
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,240
Papa!

807
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,910
Your Majesty!

808
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,920
Vivi, why're you here?

809
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,450
Well?

810
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,260
Have you resigned?

811
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,180
That would be you!

812
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,510
Thunderbolt Tempo

813
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,920
Sparkling Deity

814
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,020
Blow away.

815
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,400
Unforgivable.

816
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,500
Sea Urchin

817
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,070
Stinger

818
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,680
This doesn't hurt... even a bit...

819
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,340
Can you understand her pain?

820
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,230
Compared to that...

821
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,930
1, 2, or 3 legs...

822
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,060
Don't matter!

823
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,530
Tornado Tempo

824
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,730
What? What? What?!

825
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,710
Why...?

826
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,000
Why are you here?!

827
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,330
Where's Luffy-san?!

828
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,040
He died.

829
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,200
You're lying!

830
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,380
There's no way Luffy-san would get killed by you!

831
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,780
You think so?

832
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:44,140
The door just!

833
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,540
Go back to the palace.

834
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,720
Open the gate!

835
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,230
DiecisÃ©is Fleur

836
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,230
DiecisÃ©is Fleur: Sixteen Flowers

837
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:50,930
What?

838
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:51,980
Hands?

839
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,020
Why you... Crocodile!

840
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,840
Idiots should be quiet.

841
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,320
Cobra, I have just one question for you.

842
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,860
Because this is my ultimate goal,

843
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,040
Where's Pluton?

844
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,890
Spiral Hollow

845
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,420
I... am not at his level...

846
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,340
Spar Break

847
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,490
Bastard!

848
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,790
What the hell did you do?

849
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,120
Just getting hit with that technique...

850
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,720
I can hear it.

851
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,880
His iron's breathing...

852
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,990
Fine.

853
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:46,800
With the next strike, I'll totally stop your breathing.

854
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,720
Don't think that you can stop my technique with just one katana.

855
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,470
It's okay.

856
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,190
I won't get hit anymore.

857
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,340
You seem prepared...

858
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,650
Fine then!

859
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,910
Ittouryuu Iai

860
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,910
Ittouryuu Iai: One Sword Style Sword Draw

861
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,610
Shishi Sonson

862
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,610
Shishi Sonson: Lion Song

863
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,870
Atomic Spurt

864
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,890
I thank you.

865
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,310
Idiot...

866
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,930
Why're you crying?

867
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,680
Because that mole-hag said...

868
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,900
Luffy is dead.

869
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:42,610
I wonder if it's true.

870
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,940
You guys believe that?

871
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,070
Like I'm gonna believe it! You idiot!

872
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:48,880
Me neither!

873
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,400
I definitely don't believe it!

874
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,830
In that case, we need to hurry and catch up with everyone.

875
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,840
Wipe your nose.

876
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,090
This bloodshed must be stopped.

877
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,050
Finally got it.

878
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,940
Where's Pluton?

879
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,400
Bastard... how do you know that name...?

880
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,570
Such a thing is... in this country...?

881
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,280
The secret passed down with the throne succession...

882
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:36,390
If I have it, I can build the greatest military country.

883
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:40,200
A country with the power to even surpass that of the World Government.

884
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,300
I don't know where you heard the name of Pluton, but...

885
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,660
Even I don't know its whereabouts.

886
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,920
I'm not sure if that thing even exists.

887
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,500
I see...

888
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,390
By the way, the plaza where the royal army is gathered...

889
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,090
Today at 4:30 p.m., in other words,

890
00:47:56,090 --> 00:48:00,810
In 15 minutes, a powerful bomb will be shot according to the plan.

891
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,850
Are you insane, bastard?!

892
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,910
Its explosion will cover 5 km in diameter.

893
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,400
From this place, we could have a nice view of the change in the landscape.

894
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,380
If you do such a thing...!

895
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,170
Aren't you happy?

896
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,990
When both armies die, this rebellion will finally end.

897
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,730
What have they ever done to you!

898
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,400
Vivi-sama.

899
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,740
How can you do such a thing?!

900
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,960
Well then, Mr. Cobra, back to the question.

901
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,760
The poneglyph that has been passed down for generations by the royal family...

902
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,880
Where is it?

903
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,800
If I take you to that place...

904
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,590
No,

905
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,010
I'll guide you... to the Hall of Burials.

906
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,280
You're a wise ruler, Cobra.

907
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,470
Accompany him to the Hall of Burials, Nico Robin.

908
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,510
Understood.

909
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,760
Papa!

910
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,310
Hey,

911
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,950
Who said you could go?

912
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,260
Get your hands off Vivi-sama, traitor!

913
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:06,420
Oh? Zoan type.

914
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,830
Inu inu fruit, model jackal.

915
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,830
Inu: Dog

916
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,060
Nari Kiba

917
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,060
Nari Kiba: Roaring Fang

918
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:17,380
Chaka...

919
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,060
You also intend to die for the sake of a stranger...?

920
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,600
Vivi!

921
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:22,610
Kohza!

922
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:24,550
Are my eyes deceiving me?

923
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,400
The rebel army leader shouldn't show up in this place!

924
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,090
Kohza...

925
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,850
Hang in there, Kohza!

926
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:39,740
I came to... try to persuade the royal army... but...

927
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,840
Everything was...

928
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:45,830
My doing...

929
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,120
Kohza.

930
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,010
Zoro! Zoro!

931
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:53,210
Wake up!

932
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,070
This place has become very violent.

933
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:58,630
Let's hurry!

934
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,920
Without the king or the leader of the rebellion...

935
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,600
This has already become lizards with their heads ripped off killing each other.

936
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,630
A sudden sandstorm...

937
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,010
I can't see what's in front.

938
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,710
Don't falter!

939
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:19,610
Hit them!

940
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,080
What's with this storm?

941
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:24,720
Don't lose formation!

942
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,790
Fire back! Royal army!

943
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,760
I...

944
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,680
Can't give up.

945
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:47,850
If we stop the explosion, we can decrease the number of victims.

946
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,010
If I do this I can stop the rebellion.

947
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,560
If I do that I can stop the rebellion.

948
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:55,280
Your pathetic idealism disgusts me.

949
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,490
I don't care if it disgusts you...

950
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,990
I won't abandon my ideals...

951
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:00,950
A very devoted woman you are.

952
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,140
In the end, you couldn't stop anything.

953
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,920
The only thing your attachment to your idealism caused was an increase in the number of innocent victims!

954
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,910
I already told you!

955
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,490
You can't save this country!

956
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,340
Vivi...

957
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,300
Vivi!

958
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,260
VIVI!

959
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,720
Luffy... san.

960
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,540
Don't...

961
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,690
GIVE UP YET!

962
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,190
Luffy-san!

963
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,270
Just in time.

964
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,010
Luffy-san... Pell...

965
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,060
My voice won't reach anyone anymore...

966
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:48,950
Don't worry.

967
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,970
We can hear your voice.

968
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,080
Zoro.

969
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,250
Look at that! Over there!

970
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,050
Luffy is alive! Vivi too!

971
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,250
Didn't I tell you?!

972
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,180
I knew it all along!

973
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,140
Is that the look of a guy who knew?

974
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,150
Wait for me, Vivi-chan!

975
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,450
Let's hurry up, Zoro!

976
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:11,710
It's evident my wounds are more serious.

977
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,100
My feet are hurt, I can't stand up!

978
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,100
Liar.

979
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,700
You can read the poneglyph?

980
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,510
Yes.

981
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,850
That's the main reason I associated with Crocodile.

982
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,570
That's why he won't kill me.

983
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,530
I see.

984
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,250
The location of Pluton... as I thought is...

985
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,700
Is there any other?

986
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,090
Is this the only one in this country?

987
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,130
Are you disappointed...?

988
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,670
I kept my promise...

989
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,670
Why?!

990
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,410
What I seek isn't here either...

991
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,340
Was it as he said, Nico Robin?

992
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,670
That was fast.

993
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,450
Did you managed to decipher it?

994
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:51,810
Yes.

995
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,880
In that case, hurry up and tell me Pluton's whereabo...

996
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,710
It's not written here.

997
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,270
What?

998
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,730
Nothing more than history is written here.

999
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:03,340
Nothing like the word Pluton appears here.

1000
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,950
I see, it's a shame.

1001
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,660
You have been an excellent partner but,

1002
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,950
You're going to die right here.

1003
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,850
I'm putting an end to all this!

1004
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:16,010
Yes!

1005
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,330
Vivi!

1006
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,890
Vivi-chan!

1007
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:20,790
Are you alright?

1008
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,340
Vivi!

1009
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,800
We're also here!

1010
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,760
Everyone is safe...

1011
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,430
Are you alright, Luffy-kun?

1012
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:35,720
Yeah...

1013
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,350
What you see below is the Hall of Burials.

1014
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,680
I see.

1015
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,080
Just you wait...!

1016
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,150
Croc!

1017
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,240
Just 5 minutes to search for the bombardiers?

1018
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,230
Crocodile created this sandstorm in order to...

1019
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:03,210
Hide the bomb that is going to be fired at the plaza, so the bombardiers must be nearby.

1020
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,670
Then, high places should be suspected.

1021
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,130
High places?

1022
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:12,040
It's gonna be a 5 km in diameter blast, so that's the most probable thing to do.

1023
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,100
Besides, it's more reliable to shoot down from above than from the ground.

1024
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,060
Amazing, Usopp!

1025
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,140
I'm a sniper after all.

1026
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,270
That's enough information.

1027
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:20,860
Let's hurry.

1028
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,140
Oi!

1029
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,140
Yes!

1030
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,910
I was born a talented genius...

1031
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,620
Equal parts natural ability and heredity...

1032
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,240
Huh? Wait...

1033
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,950
Water?

1034
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,910
But it's meaningless if you can't hit me.

1035
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,700
I forgive everything, Nico Robin.

1036
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,790
Because I...

1037
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,250
From the very beginning...

1038
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,710
Didn't trust anyone!

1039
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:48,670
I can tell by Cobra's reaction that Pluton really exists.

1040
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,530
I'll just search for it myself.

1041
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:54,350
When this country falls into my hands, it'll be just a matter of time.

1042
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,290
It's still too soon for the bombardment on the plaza.

1043
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:05,940
You?!

1044
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,150
This Hall of Burials was designed to collapse upon the removal of a single stone.

1045
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:15,330
Under the name of the twelfth king in the Nefertari dynasty.

1046
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,080
I won't let you have this country of sand.

1047
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,190
So you want to bury me alive in this place.

1048
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,040
You're such a devoted king.

1049
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,250
But, I can't be killed.

1050
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,520
If I turn everything into sand I can get out.

1051
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,490
You'll die in vain, Mr. Cobra.

1052
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,890
Found you, croc.

1053
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:44,970
You.

1054
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,520
How did you escape from that quicksand...?

1055
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,480
Why're you alive?

1056
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,880
Why do you keep standing in my way?!

1057
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,160
Eh?! Strawhat!

1058
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,950
You haven't returned it yet...

1059
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,420
What you stole.

1060
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,320
What I stole?

1061
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,290
Money?

1062
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:07,750
Fame?

1063
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:09,210
Trust?

1064
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,670
Lives?

1065
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,130
Rain?

1066
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,250
The country!

1067
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,320
Impossible...

1068
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,530
Crocodile!

1069
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,070
You... it can't be...

1070
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,600
When I was stuck in the desert...

1071
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,020
I realized it when your hand touched Yuba's water.

1072
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,260
If you touch water, you can't turn into sand.

1073
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,330
But, blood is the same, isn't it?

1074
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:49,860
Fine then.

1075
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:54,550
I'll let you see hell one more time as a reward for your tenacity in challenging me.

1076
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,970
As a pirate.

1077
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,090
What's that?

1078
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,100
Poison needle.

1079
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:01,390
I see.

1080
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:05,850
A pirate's duel is a survival battle in which you put your life on the line.

1081
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,810
Words such as "unfair" don't exist in it.

1082
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,530
This is the last one.

1083
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:14,490
Let's finish this once and for...

1084
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:15,490
All!

1085
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,170
What're you doing?!

1086
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,610
Thinking like Crocodile...

1087
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:20,830
Shut up and keep searching!

1088
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,530
Chopper!

1089
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,250
Can't you find it using your nose?

1090
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:25,270
Impossible.

1091
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,460
The whole town is filled with the smell of gunpowder.

1092
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,420
Then, follow the scent of whatever is aiming at the plaza...

1093
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,920
What smell is that?!

1094
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,990
Anyway, it's a huge bomb.

1095
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,880
And it also needs room to shoot out of the cannon and fall down.

1096
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,180
There's no time left.

1097
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:51,730
Oi!

1098
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:52,310
What's wrong, Vivi?

1099
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,910
Why didn't I realize it...

1100
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:57,810
It has to be there, a spacious place people wouldn't notice.

1101
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,370
The place where I used to play when I was little.

1102
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:01,090
Vivi, if we don't hurry...

1103
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:01,820
Vivi! Usopp!

1104
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,050
Did you find it?

1105
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:03,780
Well, no, that...

1106
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,470
Usopp-san, I got it!

1107
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:06,180
Really?

1108
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,210
Then, I'll call everyone.

1109
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,790
So, where is it?

1110
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,260
Over there!

1111
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,360
It's impossible in 1 minute.

1112
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,430
Nami-san!

1113
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,890
Vivi-chan!

1114
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,350
You guys, did you find the bombardiers?

1115
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,830
Why in the world are you up there?!

1116
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,140
Huh? I unintentionally...

1117
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,780
Usopp! Hurry, we're out of time!

1118
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,860
T-that's right.

1119
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,810
Honestly, there's no way we can make it in time.

1120
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,320
If only Pell came...

1121
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,080
The bombardiers are above the clock tower!

1122
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,100
You guys jump to the clock place!

1123
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,780
Don't talk nonsense!

1124
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:45,230
Use your legs or katana, but do something!

1125
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:45,740
That's it!

1126
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,090
Gero, gero, gero, geroâ€¦

1127
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,090
Gero gero: The sound a frog makes

1128
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:02,300
Gero, gero, gero, the trophy from before sure was big.

1129
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:03,790
That's right.

1130
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,690
Gero, gero, gero, gero, but,

1131
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,610
This time I think it'll be even bigger.

1132
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,400
That's right.

1133
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,030
We just have to shoot this huge cannonball into the middle of the crowd.

1134
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,920
Isn't it good?

1135
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,070
Gomu Gomu no

1136
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,060
Soon the poison will take effect.

1137
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,220
The battle is over.

1138
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,690
So what?!

1139
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,070
You don't understand anything at all.

1140
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:42,530
What...

1141
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,950
Understand?

1142
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,340
Gomu Gomu no

1143
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,420
Gatling

1144
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,580
Don't you understand?

1145
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:18,270
You're already dead.

1146
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,750
The poison already entered through your wound.

1147
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,990
It's over.

1148
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:38,840
What?

1149
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:46,970
Why?

1150
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,460
Why do you go that far?!

1151
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:52,860
Your goal isn't in this country!

1152
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,930
Will you die for such a thing?!

1153
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,230
You all are so stupid.

1154
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:59,400
Vivi...

1155
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,220
She tells other people not to die..

1156
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:07,470
But she's always the first one to throw away her life in order to save other people.

1157
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:10,360
If we leave her alone, she'll die.

1158
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:13,130
Yes, as you just said, I sent her to the next world...

1159
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,330
Idiot!

1160
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,260
Vivi is safe.

1161
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,630
There's no way I'll let her die.

1162
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:19,850
I don't...

1163
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:22,010
I don't want her to die...!

1164
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:24,290
We're nakama!

1165
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,760
That's why, as long as she doesn't give up on the country,

1166
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,890
We won't stop fighting!

1167
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,850
Even if you die?

1168
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,330
When I die... that will be...

1169
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:38,770
That...

1170
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,780
It doesn't matter how much you shout.

1171
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:53,030
Eventually your body will stop responding to you.

1172
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,990
It doesn't matter how much you and your nakama struggle...

1173
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,910
It doesn't matter how many times you stand up to thwart my plan...

1174
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,040
Everything...

1175
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:05,000
Rests on whether you can defeat me.

1176
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,960
Gero, it's about time Mr.7.

1177
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,930
Preparing to ignite.

1178
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,040
Gero, gero, ignite!

1179
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,640
Oi! Nami! What're you trying to do?!

1180
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:22,680
Shut up!

1181
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,570
Just be quiet and stand there.

1182
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:25,690
I'm calculating right now.

1183
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,450
Even if you say stand there,

1184
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:28,690
I can't understand the meaning of this posture.

1185
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:30,040
If I do it, you'll understand.

1186
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,180
Here I go!

1187
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,320
The weather is typhoon!

1188
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,310
Cyclone Tempo

1189
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,430
O-oi!

1190
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:40,190
Cyclone tempo is just an instrument to have fun at parties...

1191
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,280
The objective is the clock tower.

1192
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,120
Chopper!

1193
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,540
Jump to where Sanji-kun is!

1194
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,050
Could it be that, the plan is...

1195
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:51,300
To keep flying until we reach the top?

1196
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,670
Sanji-kun!

1197
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:53,760
You know the rest, right?

1198
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,260
There's no time!

1199
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,480
I can somewhat tell what Nami-san's intentions are...

1200
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:58,930
Yosh!

1201
01:03:58,930 --> 01:03:59,720
There's nothing but to do it!

1202
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,030
There's no time to think about it.

1203
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,230
Please, Tony-kun.

1204
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,610
Yosh!

1205
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,730
Hang on tight!

1206
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:07,940
I see.

1207
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:09,480
Sanji!

1208
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,540
Get onto my right leg!

1209
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:13,280
There they go, Zoro!

1210
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,240
Yosh, as I thought!

1211
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,790
Zoro!

1212
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,280
Leave it to me.

1213
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,380
Katana?!

1214
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:27,770
Don't be scared.

1215
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:29,420
I'm using the back of the swords.

1216
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,440
Got it!

1217
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,380
Fly!

1218
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,230
Go!

1219
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,000
Gero?

1220
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,230
Here we go, Vivi!

1221
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,470
Please, give it all you got!

1222
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:43,480
Go!

1223
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:46,270
Kujakki String

1224
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:46,270
Kujakki: Peacock

1225
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,350
Slasher

1226
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,670
Gero, gero, it's a shame.

1227
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:53,570
You missed.

1228
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,280
Run back.

1229
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,780
Alright!

1230
01:04:59,220 --> 01:04:59,740
Sorry.

1231
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,220
It's over!

1232
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,150
D-did she stop it?

1233
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,350
How long are you planning on staying there...!

1234
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,470
What happened?

1235
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,390
Vivi hasn't come out.

1236
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:42,830
It can't be...

1237
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:45,790
What a cowardly act!

1238
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,820
That's what you call being careful in an assault.

1239
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,750
Mr. Cobra.

1240
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,720
You should make preparations for every possible accident in the plan.

1241
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,930
The difference is 2 minutes.

1242
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,300
This can't be...

1243
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,820
The bomb has a timer!

1244
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:07,480
At this rate, it will blow up!

1245
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,780
What did you say?!

1246
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:18,860
Preventing the destruction of the plaza was impossible from the beginning?

1247
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,710
How long are you going to make fun of people...

1248
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,080
You can't save the country.

1249
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:30,830
How long until you're satisfied with ridiculing the people?

1250
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,640
There's no way...

1251
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:58,990
You can defeat me!

1252
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,950
Are these the only words you can squeeze out?

1253
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:05,660
What you just blabbed sounded like the bluff of a loser.

1254
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,620
Without support.

1255
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:08,580
I am...

1256
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,190
The man who will become the Pirate King!

1257
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,840
I already told you!

1258
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:20,470
There are many rookies like you in this sea!

1259
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:24,510
The more you get to know the level of this sea...

1260
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,140
The more you lose sight of those dreams!

1261
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,570
I am...

1262
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,630
The man...

1263
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,030
Who will surpass you!

1264
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,000
It's a nostalgic place, isn't it?

1265
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,630
The Suna Suna Clan secret base.

1266
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:50,750
Pell!

1267
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:53,720
The bomb has a timer.

1268
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,720
It'll blow up any minute now!

1269
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,220
I no longer...

1270
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,300
Vivi-sama...

1271
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,050
I'm really proud from the bottom of my heart...

1272
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:13,000
To have served the Nefertari family.

1273
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:25,330
Pell!

1274
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,750
I am...

1275
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,760
The Guardian of Arabasta!

1276
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,490
The Falcon!

1277
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,280
The one who destroys...

1278
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,520
The royal family's enemies!

1279
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,080
Hey, Pell.

1280
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:26,660
Yes?

1281
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:29,740
Why do you practice fencing everyday?

1282
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,250
Because I'm a guardian.

1283
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,560
In order to protect this country,

1284
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,160
I need to become stronger.

1285
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,090
Who are you going to fight?

1286
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:37,970
Well...

1287
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:40,520
It's more about protecting than fighting.

1288
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,060
Is it different?

1289
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,760
The intention is different.

1290
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,110
That's strange.

1291
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:49,490
Pell...

1292
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,210
That bastard...

1293
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:53,050
He protected the country.

1294
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,160
Oi.

1295
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,460
No way.

1296
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,230
Why don't they stop?

1297
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,430
Please stop!

1298
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:34,450
PLEASE, STOP FIGHTING!

1299
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:38,200
PLEASE, STOP FIGHTING!

1300
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,880
Please, stop fighting!

1301
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:43,130
Vivi...

1302
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:46,350
PLEASE, STOP FIGHTING!

1303
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:49,300
Please, stop fighting!

1304
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,710
You idiot...

1305
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,970
What're you just standing there for?!

1306
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:57,480
Punch them, kick them, and stop the rebellion!

1307
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:01,810
The scorpion's venom, without a doubt, has already taken effect.

1308
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,530
Where does this kid get his power from...?

1309
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,990
Who do you think I am?!

1310
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,200
I don't care who the hell you are!

1311
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,010
I...!

1312
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:18,910
Will...!

1313
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:21,370
Surpass you!

1314
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,210
Bastard!

1315
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,510
Sables Pesado

1316
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,510
Sables Pesado: Heavy Sabers

1317
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,990
Gomu Gomu no

1318
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,830
Desert

1319
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,450
Storm!

1320
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,030
La Espada

1321
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:36,990
Oi! Look at that!

1322
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:48,590
Crocodile!

1323
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,740
Luffy... san...

1324
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,520
Oi, you!

1325
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,520
Even when there's no enemy...

1326
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:15,080
Are you alright?

1327
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,250
This is...

1328
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:27,710
Please, don't shed more blood.

1329
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:34,400
Please... STOP FIGHTING!

1330
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,600
Rain...

1331
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,150
It rained!

1332
01:13:55,910 --> 01:14:00,370
Just like it's raining now, it will rain again like it did before.

1333
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:03,160
Vivi's voice reached them.

1334
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,000
It's Vivi-sama.

1335
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:06,830
Vivi-sama...

1336
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:13,000
The nightmare has ended.

1337
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,960
I thank you.

1338
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,600
Don't mention it.

1339
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,670
Armies, drop your weapons!

1340
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,710
Chaka-sama!

1341
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:35,900
Kohza-san!

1342
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:39,960
This battle was being manipulated from the beginning!

1343
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,490
By Crocodile!

1344
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,760
Everyone... where are you?

1345
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,500
He came.

1346
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:04,300
You guys are...?

1347
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:07,760
Thanks for bringing that guy you've got on your back.

1348
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,270
He's one of ours.

1349
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,520
The one in charge.

1350
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,010
Everyone!

1351
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:12,910
Papa?

1352
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:13,740
It's Vivi!

1353
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:14,770
Vivi...

1354
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:18,190
I see, so you're the ones who brought Vivi...

1355
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,000
He's the one who saved us.

1356
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,910
After fighting Crocodile, even with that wounded body of his, he carried two people out to the exit.

1357
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:28,120
What impressive will power...

1358
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,880
Let's hurry and treat his wounds.

1359
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,750
You guys too.

1360
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,920
Anyway, Vivi, you should hurry back to the plaza.

1361
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:39,190
At long last, after stopping the country's rebellion, a speech from the king and the princess...

1362
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,330
Is to be expected.

1363
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:41,930
Then, everyone also...

1364
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,900
You understand, right?

1365
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:49,770
We're just common people, we have nothing to do with this country or anything.

1366
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:51,520
I'm hungry.

1367
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,940
You can go to the palace if you want.

1368
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,310
I'm exhausted.

1369
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,000
Yes.

1370
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:08,330
Lamenting is natural.

1371
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,700
The thoughts of regret are also natural.

1372
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:13,920
The losses are many, the winnings are not.

1373
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:16,160
King.

1374
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,840
However, this is the time to move forward.

1375
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:21,280
No matter who the enemy we fought was...

1376
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,470
The battle that occurred here, is over now.

1377
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:29,310
No one can change what happened in the past!

1378
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:32,890
Let's stand above this war and show that we can keep existing!

1379
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:36,500
Kingdom of Arabasta!

1380
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:48,210
Look, Kohza.

1381
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:49,740
It rained.

1382
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:53,490
Just 3 years...

1383
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:55,730
It just took that time...

1384
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,510
Right?

1385
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:59,000
Rain...

1386
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,930
You are still awake, Vivi?

1387
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:23,530
Papa...

1388
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:25,490
You can't sleep?

1389
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:28,730
It's just that I don't want to sleep yet.

1390
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:33,260
I want to look at this rain a little more...

1391
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:38,470
Already the rain that wasn't forced to fall...

1392
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:42,760
For three days that rain hasn't stopped falling on this kingdom.

1393
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:48,340
What a great nap!

1394
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:49,980
Luffy!

1395
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,870
Ah! Where's my hat?

1396
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:58,380
Hat...

1397
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,470
I'm hungry!

1398
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:00,080
Where's breakfast?

1399
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:00,670
Where's my hat?

1400
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:02,110
I'm hungry!

1401
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:02,610
What a nice nap.

1402
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:03,290
I'm hungry.

1403
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:04,060
I'm hungry.

1404
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:04,950
What a nice nap.

1405
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,070
I'm glad!

1406
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,120
Luffy-san is fully recovered.

1407
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,570
Ah! My hat!

1408
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,430
Oh! Thank goodness!

1409
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,190
Vivi, it's been a while!

1410
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:16,560
Ah? A while?

1411
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,620
Well, you slept for 3 days, so that means you're recovered, right?

1412
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,310
3 days?!

1413
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:23,880
That means I missed 15 meals?

1414
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,740
How come you're so fast calculating that?

1415
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:29,050
Although, you calculated 5 meals per day.

1416
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:32,430
If you want to eat, just say so anytime you want.

1417
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,690
That's dirty!

1418
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:45,370
Ah! Luffy, you got my plate!

1419
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,820
Oi, oi.

1420
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,090
There's still plenty...

1421
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:51,250
Are you Wapol?!

1422
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:54,990
Everyone, big trouble!

1423
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,710
A-a marine fleet is coming towards the country.

1424
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:05,170
Already?

1425
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,790
We'll... there's no reason to keep staying.

1426
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,880
The captain already woke up.

1427
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,930
The marines should be coming soon.

1428
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,810
Luffy, you decide.

1429
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:17,060
Yosh! We'll eat Arabasta food one more time and then leave.

1430
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,890
We're leaving sooner! You idiot!

1431
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:24,320
Hey, everyone...

1432
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:25,910
Vivi...

1433
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,050
I...

1434
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:28,770
What shall I do?

1435
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,010
Come with us, Vivi.

1436
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,990
Definitely come! Come now!

1437
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:41,340
Vivi, tomorrow at 12:00 p.m., we'll come by the eastern harbor one last time.

1438
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:44,070
If you want to keep traveling with us, please come.

1439
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,950
Then we'll have a welcome party.

1440
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,500
As pirates though.

1441
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,490
You're the princess of a country so,

1442
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,510
That's the best offer we can make.

1443
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:57,750
Carue...

1444
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:00,430
What would you want?

1445
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:02,950
I...

1446
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:08,400
I've been saved twice by two who hold the name "D"...

1447
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,860
Monkey D. Luffy and...

1448
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:14,240
Yosh! Let's go up!

1449
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,990
I no longer have a reason to keep living.

1450
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,570
Please, put me down!

1451
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:25,370
Why should I listen to what you say?

1452
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,500
Jaguar D. Saul...

1453
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:32,720
Someday, without a doubt, you'll find your nakama.

1454
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:34,580
There's nothing as absurd as...

1455
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:38,430
Being born into this world to be alone!

1456
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:42,510
My dream has too many enemies.

1457
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,390
Dereshishishi...

1458
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:46,820
Dereshishishi...

1459
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:49,380
They're definitely waiting for you somewhere in this sea...

1460
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:52,320
Go meet your nakama, Robin!

1461
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:00,470
The plaza is full of people already.

1462
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:01,510
Really?

1463
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:05,770
It was announced that Vivi-sama's speech would began at 12:00 p.m.

1464
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:08,830
Originally, it was going to take place when you were 14 years old...

1465
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,130
Your coming of age ceremony.

1466
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:13,140
Today, everyone is expecting it.

1467
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,750
I'm coming in, Vivi.

1468
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,850
Sit down, Papa.

1469
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:25,500
No... Father.

1470
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,940
I have something important to tell you.

1471
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:45,900
Look! It's Vivi-sama!

1472
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,290
Vivi-sama!

1473
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,140
We've been waiting!

1474
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:50,750
Princess!

1475
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,270
You've grown!

1476
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,310
I went on an adventure just for a while.

1477
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,270
Well... it's nothing to be alarmed about.

1478
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,370
Kohza! It started already!

1479
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:13,230
With something as big as that, it can be heard across the whole country.

1480
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,040
It started as a journey full of despair across a dark sea.

1481
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,200
On my dark journey...

1482
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:24,870
Inside a storm, I found one small ship.

1483
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:28,370
The ship pushed my back, saying...

1484
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:32,430
Can't you see that light?

1485
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:38,880
Without losing it's course within the darkness, that ship...

1486
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,250
Surpassed the big waves as if it were dancing.

1487
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:46,090
Never opposing the sea, always going forward!

1488
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:48,600
Then, a finger raised.

1489
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,470
Look, a light appeared.

1490
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:56,990
History, before long, will call this an illusion, but...

1491
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,600
To me, that's the only truth!

1492
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,710
Did you hear the speech just now?

1493
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:11,380
Without a doubt it's Vivi's voice.

1494
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:12,320
Vivi...

1495
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,160
It might be a voice similar to Vivi's.

1496
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,170
It's a ceremony being broadcast from Alubarna.

1497
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:17,830
She already decided not to come.

1498
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,460
Let's go, it's past 12:00 p.m..

1499
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,670
There's no way she won't come.

1500
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:22,780
Let's get out and search.

1501
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,020
She must be nearby.

1502
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,500
This is bad.

1503
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,270
The marine fleet is coming.

1504
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:28,060
They already came?!

1505
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,580
Prepare the ship.

1506
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,480
Give it up, Luffy.

1507
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,760
Vivi-chan is a princess.

1508
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,110
What the hell is going on?!

1509
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:39,070
Show your face, fake princess!

1510
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:41,730
Where's the real Vivi-sama?!

1511
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,120
Vivi-sama must now be...

1512
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:51,080
Everyone!

1513
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:52,310
Vivi!

1514
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:54,380
Carue!

1515
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,090
Everyone!

1516
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:58,900
See?! She came!

1517
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,450
Vivi!

1518
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:01,300
Yosh! I'm turning back the ship!

1519
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,150
She came after all!

1520
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:06,380
Oi! Hurry up and turn back the ship.

1521
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:07,770
I came...

1522
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,330
To say goodbye!

1523
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,440
What did... she say just now?

1524
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,120
I can't go with you!

1525
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,110
Who is she shouting to?

1526
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:26,240
Really, thank you for everything until now!

1527
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,310
I want to keep going on adventures but, after all I...

1528
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:34,750
Love this country!

1529
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:46,740
So, I can't go...

1530
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,660
I see.

1531
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:54,780
I...

1532
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,030
I'm... staying here but...

1533
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,000
If someday...

1534
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,490
We meet again...

1535
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:08,820
Will you one more time...

1536
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:13,730
Call me Nakama?!

1537
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,800
We'll always be naka...!

1538
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,650
Don't answer!

1539
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:24,760
The marines are nearby.

1540
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:27,890
If they find out that we have something to do with Vivi...

1541
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:30,100
Vivi will also become a criminal.

1542
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,250
This will have to be a silent farewell.

1543
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,000
From now on, if anything happens,

1544
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,720
Show this on your left arm!

1545
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,290
It's the mark of nakama!

1546
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,130
Depart!

1547
01:26:56,870 --> 01:27:02,220
Mamoritai mono ga aru

1548
01:26:56,870 --> 01:27:02,220
There's something I want to protect

1549
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:08,200
Kono basho de tsuyoku naru kara

1550
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:08,200
In this place where I became strong

1551
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:18,410
Nigirishimeta kobushi wo mata nigirishimeta

1552
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:18,410
This fist I once clenched tightly, I clenched again

1553
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:29,860
Hontou ni daiji na koto wa kotoba dewa tsutawaranai

1554
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:29,860
The important thing is to convey it in words

1555
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:34,780
Yukkuri to yukkuri to ima

1556
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:34,780
Slowly slowly now

1557
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:41,220
Sono senaka wo mitsumete itanda

1558
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:41,220
I was gazing at that back

1559
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:51,200
Dou ikiru ka wa jibun de kimeru koto da to wakatta

1560
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:51,200
Now I know the way to live is something you decide by yourself

1561
01:27:51,200 --> 01:28:00,790
Hontou no yuuki wa kitto yasashisa dattanda ne

1562
01:27:51,200 --> 01:28:00,790
True courage was definitely graceful, wasn't it?

1563
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:11,800
Nakanai koto wo kimeta hazu na no ni namida afurete tomaranakatta yo

1564
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:11,800
Although I decided not to cry, I couldn't stop the tears from overflowing

1565
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:17,170
Samishiin janai kanashiin janai

1566
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:17,170
It isn't lonely, it isn't sad

1567
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:22,360
Yuuki wo kureta kara nanda

1568
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:22,360
Because I've been given courage

1569
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:36,170
Tabidachi wo kimeta asa tomeru koto dekinakatta yo

1570
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:36,170
The morning you decided to set out, I couldn't do anything to stop you

1571
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:47,840
Michi no tsuzuki chigau keredo shinjiteru yo

1572
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:47,840
Though our paths have diverged, I believe in you

1573
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:57,750
Daremo ga kodoku no kazu dake kokoro itame tsuke au darou

1574
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:57,750
Anyone destined only for solitude is bound to have a heartache, it seems

1575
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:11,710
Kizuna wo wasurenaide

1576
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:11,710
I'll never forget our bonds

1577
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:16,860
What's this?

1578
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,210
This?

1579
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:19,660
It's a nakama mark.

1580
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,770
Nakama?

1581
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:21,780
Yes.

1582
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:24,560
The mark of very important nakama.

1583
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:30,740
Everyone, are you doing well?

1584
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,740
Right now, where are you traveling to?

1585
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:38,820
Sometimes I remember the memories of back then and come here.

1586
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:42,000
Because, I...

1587
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:44,020
We...

1588
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:47,730
Will always be nakama!

1589
01:29:50,305 --> 01:30:50,467
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
