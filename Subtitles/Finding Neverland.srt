00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,753
- (man) Lights up!
- (man #2) Beginners, please!

5
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,047
- (man #3) Your five-minute call, sir.
- (man #1) Places.

6
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,466
(man #2) Places. Everyone to their places.

7
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,051
(man #1) Sh. Quiet, everyone.

8
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,553
(man) Opening nights?
I love opening nights.

9
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:30,930
(laughter)

10
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,557
- How are you? Good to see you.
- (man #2) Good evening, Charles.

11
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,142
- (Charles) Sir Herbert, how are you?
- This is my wife.

12
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:37,353
- Oh, Lady Herbert.
- How do you do?

13
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:38,145
May I give you a peck?

14
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:40,105
(Herbert) One of Mr Barrie's finest?

15
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,857
(Charles) Oh, that genius Scotsman
has done it again.

16
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,235
It's the best thing I've produced
in 25 years.

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,029
I already have investors interested
back home in New York.

18
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:50,741
- (Herbert) See you on Broadway!
- (laughter)

19
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:07,341
(man) First positions, people.

20
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:11,262
(man #2) Standing by, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:13,848
If you could take
your opening positions, please.

22
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:21,939
Beginners, please take
your opening positions.

23
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,359
Audience are coming in. Standing by.

24
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,218
- Good audience.
- Sorry?

25
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,949
Good audience tonight.

26
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,368
OK. That's great, thank you.
How much longer?

27
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:36,662
Um, ten minutes, sir.

28
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:41,334
(Charles) I love opening nights.

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,836
I want to dance with your wife
at the after-party.

30
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:45,838
- Oh, my goodness.
- Good evening, Mr Frohman.

31
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,505
- How are you, John?
- V ery well.

32
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:50,259
(Charles) It's the best thing
that I've produced in 25 years.

33
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,470
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Healthy and wealthy, I see.

34
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:54,430
(Charles) You've rearranged a holiday
for me and I won't forget it.

35
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:55,931
- For you, Charles, anything.
- You won't regret it.

36
00:01:55,973 --> 00:01:56,932
(John) I'm sure.

37
00:01:57,308 --> 00:02:00,061
- Have you got the tickets?
- They're in my pocket.

38
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,939
- There's Mrs Barrie.
- Oh, Mr and Mrs Snow.

39
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:08,653
We were so hoping to speak
with your husband before the show.

40
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:12,239
- (Mr Snow) Have you seen him?
- I'm not sure where he is, actually.

41
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,458
(audience murmurs)

42
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:35,512
(Mrs Snow) We do miss seeing you
on stage. You were so wonderful.

43
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:39,850
Yes, well, it's been some time now.
Are you right to find your seat?

44
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:42,269
Oh, yes, yes.

45
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:45,356
See you at the party, then.

46
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:46,857
Excuse me. Could you find Mr Barrie

47
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:50,152
and remind him that they're doing his play
this evening.

48
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:52,863
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

49
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:14,844
(Charles) Let's close the doors.

50
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:48,961
(applause)

51
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:58,637
(actor) Really, I mustn't
inconvenience you in this way.

52
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:00,931
I can wait quite well in the shop.

53
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:05,561
'Tis no inconvenience.
The shop is chilly. And there is a fire here.

54
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:06,937
(actor #1) Really,
you are uncommonly good.

55
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:09,565
Sorry, sir.

56
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:12,735
Mrs Barrie wanted me to remind you
that the play's begun.

57
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,175
- Though I imagine you know that.
- They hate it.

58
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:19,241
- Sir?
- It's like a dentist's office out there. Why?

59
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:25,456
- I wouldn't say they hate it, sir.
- What do you think? Do you like it?

60
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,042
- I've just been hired here, sir.
- Yes or no? I'm not bothered.

61
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:32,463
- I'm not really qualified to...
- Do you like it? Is it crap?

62
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:34,840
- Crap, sir?
- Go on, say it. Just say it.

63
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,550
It's shite, isn't it? Go on. Say it.

64
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:39,553
- Don't know if I'm...
- "It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie." Go on, say it.

65
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:41,055
- It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie.
- I knew it.

66
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:45,351
- No, I haven't even seen it.
- I knew it. Thank you.

67
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,561
Thank you very much.

68
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:53,567
(actor) Might I knock a tune, milord,
for a moment?

69
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,570
(rumble of thunder)

70
00:04:57,571 --> 00:04:58,864
- I'm an old man...
- (snoring)

71
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,158
...and I've seen few of the sights.

72
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,970
(man) Absolute rubbish from start to finish.

73
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,887
(man #2) Yes, I found it fearfully dull.

74
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:24,849
(man #3) Say goodbye to your investment,
old boy.

75
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,351
Good to see you. My apologies.

76
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,893
We'll get them with the next one, Charles,
I promise.

77
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:32,356
- Of course we will, James.
- I know you put a lot into this one.

78
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,360
A fortune, James, but I am fortunate
because I can afford to lose a fortune.

79
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:39,030
- Can you?
- No, I can't. How are you?

80
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:41,657
- Arthur.
- James.

81
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,451
You were sorely missed
at the last club meeting.

82
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:44,660
Was I?

83
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:48,748
We were beginning to wonder
which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

84
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,541
You wanted to speak with Mr Barrie,
didn't you?

85
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,669
Oh, yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them,
should we?

86
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,755
I don't see why not.

87
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,258
If you ask me, the problem
lies in our batting order.

88
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,052
- James.
- Hello, darling.

89
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,845
You remember Mr and Mrs Snow,
don't you?

90
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,847
- Mrs Snow.
- Mr Barrie.

91
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,057
Mr Snow.

92
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,934
The Snows have been waiting
to meet with you all evening.

93
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,354
- (Mrs Snow) Oh, yes.
- Is that right?

94
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,151
Your play this evening,
it was remarkable, wasn't it?

95
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,862
Was it?

96
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:25,743
Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.
I'm glad you liked it.

97
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:29,747
How did you feel it went?

98
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:32,667
- I think I can do better.
- Really?

99
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,839
(ringing)

100
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,269
- Mary? Hello?
- (distant) Yes, James?

101
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:57,149
I'm headed off for the park if you'd
like to join me. It's a beautiful morning.

102
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,652
You'll be working, won't you?

103
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,030
Perhaps, yes.

104
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,033
I'll let you to your work then.

105
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:16,836
- Morning, Mr Barrie.
- Morning, Emma.

106
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,549
- Have a good day, sir.
- And you.

107
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,554
That's it. Go on, boy. Go get it, boy.

108
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:31,434
That's right. Good boy. Grab it. Good.

109
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:01,004
(woman laughs)

110
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:04,467
Who do you belong to?
Come on, boy. Come on.

111
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:12,141
Excuse me, sir,
you're standing on my sleeve.

112
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:14,852
Am I? So sorry.

113
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:18,230
I might point out
you're lying under my bench.

114
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:20,607
I have to, I'm afraid.

115
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:25,071
I've been put in a dungeon
by the evil Prince George.

116
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,365
I'm sorry if it bothers you.

117
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,535
Well, if you're trapped in the dungeon,
there isn't much to be done now, is there?

118
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:33,454
Perhaps I could slide a key to you
through the bars.

119
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:39,460
I wouldn't risk it, sir. The evil
Prince George has tortured many men.

120
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:41,378
I'm sorry. Is he bothering you, sir?

121
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:45,758
My brother can be
an extremely irritating sort of person.

122
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,635
Aha, Prince George, I gather.

123
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:52,348
I understand you are the horrible tyrant
who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch.

124
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:56,352
I'm not horrible really, but a firm ruler, yes.
Kind and tolerant.

125
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:59,855
And what precisely is...
What did you say your name was?

126
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:02,858
- Michael.
- What precisely is Michael's crime?

127
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,736
- He's my younger brother.
- Ah.

128
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:11,158
- Fair enough. Sorry, lad. Cannot free you.
- That's all right.

129
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,160
- Do you mind us playing with your dog?
- No. Go on.

130
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:17,456
This is Jack, second in line to the throne
and that one's Michael. He's only five.

131
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,835
And I'm in prison for it.

132
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:25,256
- I'm so sorry. Are my boys bothering you?
- (Michael) We're not bothering him, Mum.

133
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,258
Michael, darling,
come out from under there.

134
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,135
I can't. I'm in prison.

135
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:31,762
Oh, I see.

136
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:33,972
JM Barrie. Pleased to meet you.

137
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,560
JM Barrie, the author? A pleasure.
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.

138
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,353
- (Jack) Are you a writer?
- I am.

139
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:42,732
He's a playwright, Jack.
Quite a famous one, at that.

140
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:45,067
- I apologize. I imagine you're writing.
- No. Not at all.

141
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:48,571
- Where's Peter?
- What have you written, Mr Barrie?

142
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:55,369
Well, currently, I make my living
entertaining princes and their courts

143
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,830
with my trained bear, Porthos.

144
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:59,706
If you command your brother,
Peter, to join us,

145
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:03,044
I am willing, Prince George,
to give you just such a performance

146
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:06,464
in exchange for the freedom
of this prisoner, of course.

147
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:08,049
- V ery well.
- V ery well.

148
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:10,592
Now...

149
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:14,930
I want you to pay particular attention
to the teeth.

150
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:17,807
(Porthos whines)

151
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:22,563
Some unscrupulous trainers will show you
a bear whose teeth have all been pulled,

152
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:27,151
while other cowards
will force the brute into a muzzle.

153
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:33,449
Only the true master would attempt these
tricks without either measure of safety.

154
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:38,954
- What did you bring me over here for?
- (whispers) Peter.

155
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:41,832
This is absurd. It's just a dog.

156
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,337
Come on, darling.

157
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:50,633
- "Just a dog"? "Just"?
- (Porthos whines)

158
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,760
Porthos, don't listen to him.

159
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,762
Porthos dreams of being a bear

160
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:59,558
and you want to dash those dreams
by saying he's "just a dog"? (tuts)

161
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,644
What a horrible, candle-snuffing word.

162
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:05,940
That's like saying, "He can't climb
that mountain, he's just a man."

163
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:10,653
Or, "That's not a diamond, it's just a rock."

164
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,156
"Just."

165
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:21,247
Fine then. Turn him into a bear. If you can.

166
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,081
Peter, where are your manners?

167
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:27,962
With those eyes, my bonny lad,
I'm afraid you'd never see it.

168
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:33,759
However, with just a wee bit of imagination,

169
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:37,930
I can turn around right now and see...

170
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,057
the great bear, Porthos.

171
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:43,644
Dance with me.

172
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:46,439
(laughter)

173
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,154
(bear snarls)

174
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:56,032
(applause)

175
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,760
(crowd gasps and laughs)

176
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:49,168
Thank you. I don't think I've ever seen
a performance quite like it.

177
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:53,339
We're here every day, and the bear
is always more than happy to perform.

178
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,549
(Sylvia) Well, perhaps we'll see you here
tomorrow then.

179
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:57,843
Perhaps.

180
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,846
- Peter, jump up please, darling. Quick.
- (children) Bye.

181
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:03,265
Bye.

182
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:06,769
- Peter, didn't you enjoy that?
- I've seen better.

183
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:09,730
Well, Michael wanted the bear
kept prisoner with him,

184
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:12,858
and Peter insisted
that Michael was hardly a prisoner

185
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:15,945
and Porthos simply wasn't a bear at all.

186
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:20,157
I do very much hope to see them tomorrow.

187
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:23,744
- What's her name?
- Sylvia. Um...

188
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:27,665
Mrs... something Davies.

189
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,960
Llewelyn Davies?

190
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:35,339
- You know her?
- I know who she is, of course.

191
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:38,091
Why, she's a du Maurier,
for heaven's sake.

192
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:44,348
Her father was the artist.
Her brother's the actor.

193
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:49,437
And there was something... tragic
that happened with her husband.

194
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:52,565
Oh, yes. He died.

195
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:56,152
Cancer of the jaw, I believe.

196
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,737
That's horrible.

197
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:04,243
Yes. Apparently, he left her with four boys
and no income to speak of.

198
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:08,539
If it wasn't for her mother's help...

199
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:15,046
James.

200
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:20,468
- We should have them to dinner.
- Should we?

201
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:25,118
Absolutely. I've always wanted
to meet Madam du Maurier.

202
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:29,435
Why, she knows practically
everyone there is worth knowing.

203
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,369
- What are you writing about?
- Oh.

204
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,038
Nothing of any great consequence.

205
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,833
I can't write.

206
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,836
Have you ever kept a journal?

207
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,840
Ever tried your hand at writing a play?

208
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,968
Well, then how do you know?

209
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:07,139
I know. That's all.

210
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:11,644
I see. Where's your mother today
and the rest of the boys?

211
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,648
Home. Mother's got a bit of a chest cold.

212
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:22,238
I'm sure everyone would be happy
to see you though. One afternoon.

213
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:27,159
I should leave you to your writing.

214
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:33,707
Peter.

215
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,960
I'll see you later then.

216
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:49,118
Why didn't you tell me, Charles?
You knew it wasn't any good.

217
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:52,643
Why didn't you tell me, James?
You knew it wasn't any good. Hm?

218
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:57,356
I took an extended lease on the theater,
keeping the actors on.

219
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,569
- I don't have another play.
- I'm sure you will.

220
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,365
- Won't you?
- We'll see.

221
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,368
I need you to sign for the storage,
Mr Frohman.

222
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:14,248
- (man) Lower.
- (man #2) Easy does it. Take your time.

223
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,466
It was never meant to be taken seriously.

224
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:27,261
You know what happened, James?
They changed it.

225
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:32,141
- They changed what?
- The critics.

226
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:36,354
They made it important.

227
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:42,652
Hm?

228
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:44,862
What's it called?

229
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,971
What's it called?

230
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:52,662
- "Play."
- "Play."

231
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:04,589
(whip crack)

232
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,759
(boys) Bang, bang, bang!

233
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:08,844
Bang!

234
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:13,140
Return the boy to us, you nasty Injun.

235
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:16,435
Our people teach boy Indian ways,
make him great warrior.

236
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:20,648
Our chief, Running Nose, never let him go.

237
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:22,942
Bang, bang, bang!

238
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:28,864
Me wounded, Peter. Time's short.

239
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,327
You go. Spread wings
and soar like eagle above enemy.

240
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:37,665
Fly back to our chief.
Tell her of my brave defeat.

241
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:40,334
That's crazy. Indians can't fly.

242
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:42,502
Of course they can. Go on, go on, go on.

243
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:45,047
Listen to us, boy.
This Injun kidnapped you.

244
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:49,592
Not true. We kidnap no one. You lost boy.

245
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:54,348
I teach you ways of the brave.
I take you as my own son.

246
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,143
You are not my father.

247
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:01,147
(boys) Bang, bang, bang, bang!

248
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,940
- I've got him!
- Let me go!

249
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:05,443
- (George) Stop it, you two.
- Ooh, we are awful, aren't we?

250
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:07,570
- I'm warning you.
- Oh, I'm scared.

251
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:09,447
Of course, you had a bit of fun
for a change.

252
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,366
- (George) Stop it, you two. Get off!
- (Peter) Don't.

253
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,368
- Jack!
- (George) Stop it!

254
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,455
- (Jack) Get off, George!
- (Sylvia) Peter.

255
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:23,836
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it wasn't your fault.

256
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,755
I'm afraid it might have been.

257
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,842
To be honest, I'm just happy you got him
to join in the game.

258
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,470
Oh, yes, I was a tremendous success.

259
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,265
Mr Barrie, it's more
than I've been able to achieve.

260
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:40,269
Peter's a different boy since his father died.

261
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:44,273
You know, I don't think
he's even had a good cry about it.

262
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:48,069
Well, grief affects us all in different ways,
doesn't it?

263
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,570
Yes, it does.

264
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:56,160
Oh, by the way, my wife would like
to invite you and the boys over to dinner.

265
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:59,330
Your mother as well.

266
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,248
Oh.

267
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:05,169
How kind. That would be lovely.

268
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:08,964
Well...

269
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:12,175
Don't you all look lovely in your little suits?

270
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:17,932
And, Mrs du Maurier, what a shame it is
that we've not met until this evening.

271
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,100
How kind of you to say so.

272
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:24,563
Not at all. I can't tell you how many times
I've been to a charity or a social event

273
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:28,359
and seen your name listed
among the organizers.

274
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:35,449
It's the very thing I would love to do myself

275
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,785
- if I could just find the time.
- (boys snigger)

276
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:42,665
My problem is in finding the time
to do everything else.

277
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,792
At the moment I am running
two households.

278
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,170
Sylvia believes she can get by
without a housekeeper.

279
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:49,338
Mother.

280
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,257
My house is quite large enough for us all,

281
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:55,553
- but the idea of living with me seems...
- Not now, please, mother.

282
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,848
- We help her keep the house in order.
- Don't interrupt, George.

283
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:02,475
- Where did you get your manners?
- Sorry, Grandmother.

284
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:07,940
Mr Barrie, I understand you've become
playmates of my grandchildren.

285
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,070
- Oh, they indulge me, really.
- On the contrary.

286
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:18,242
The other day we took to an exploration
of darkest Africa in our garden.

287
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:23,831
But Mr Barrie was taken ill
by the bite of a... What was it?

288
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:26,334
Tsetse fly. Quite horrible.

289
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:29,045
Yes, and he swelled to the size
of a hippopotamus.

290
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:30,463
Fingers like sausages.

291
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:33,966
And we had to float in him down the river
like he was a great bloated raft.

292
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:37,845
(Jack) But the fishing was good, wasn't it?

293
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,434
James.

294
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,230
- Please.
- (boys snigger and laugh)

295
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:51,067
- (James) Bye.
- (Mrs du Maurier) Thank you so much.

296
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:52,735
- (Mary) Lovely evening.
- (Peter) Thank you. Bye.

297
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,530
- (Mary) Good night.
- (George) Good night.

298
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:03,537
Well, that was a disaster.

299
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,959
(Mrs du Maurier) Painful.
Utterly painful to see.

300
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,837
I don't know what you mean.
I had a lovely time.

301
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,089
Oh, James, please.

302
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,469
"My problem is in finding
the time to do everything else."

303
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:23,140
- I never felt so judged in my life.
- Judged? How do you mean?

304
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:25,434
(Mrs du Maurier) A grown man,
for heaven's sake,

305
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:28,354
playing all day long with children?

306
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:33,150
In any case, I hardly think they'll be
the social contact we'd hoped for.

307
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:37,530
I hadn't really thought of them that way.
I just enjoy their company.

308
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:41,033
He's been a good friend to us, Mother.

309
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:44,870
Yes. But what does that mean? Hm?

310
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:45,830
Surely you don't intend...

311
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:51,335
...to keep spending your afternoons
with those children, do you?

312
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,966
And so today, ladies and gentlemen,

313
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:01,053
using only the wind
and his own physical strength,

314
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:04,640
George Llewelyn Davies shall test
the very limits of the atmosphere

315
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:07,100
using his tethered craft. Go on, boy.

316
00:22:07,101 --> 00:22:09,770
- (Jack) Go on, George.
- (Peter) You're going to break it, George.

317
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:12,064
- George, stop!
- I just need a bit more speed.

318
00:22:12,106 --> 00:22:13,858
(Michael) I want to do it.

319
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:16,861
Hold off a bit, George.
I think it's in need of a tail.

320
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:18,738
(Sylvia) Oh, wait.

321
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,407
- Here. James, this will do.
- That's a good idea.

322
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,535
- (George) No, it's not heavy enough.
- (Michael) I want to do it.

323
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:28,539
- You coming, Peter?
- (James whistles) Porthos!

324
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:30,750
Lt'll work this time.

325
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,753
Porthos, give us your bell. That's good.

326
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:34,878
- Michael?
- Yeah?

327
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:38,341
- Now, would you like to give it a go?
- Yes, please.

328
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:41,844
- (Jack) Oh, he can't run fast enough.
- Of course he can.

329
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:44,764
- Let him try, Jack.
- (James) Now, George, you hold the kite.

330
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:45,805
George.

331
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:49,644
Come on, boys, let's go back up to the top.
Come on, Peter.

332
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:55,066
Right, George, hold it up. Darling,
you've got to run now. Ready? Ready?

333
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:58,069
- Run! Run, Michael!
- Run!

334
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:02,740
- Oh, I told you this wasn't going to work.
- I don't think he's fast enough.

335
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:04,742
It's not going to work
if no one believes in him.

336
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:07,244
- Now, give him a chance.
- Michael, go back to your starting position.

337
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:09,664
- Come on, darling, try again.
- George, you take the kite.

338
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:15,836
Now this time, I don't want a flea's breath
of doubt. We must get that kite in the air.

339
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,131
(Sylvia) Right. Look, I think I feel a bit
more breeze. Are you ready, Michael?

340
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:22,134
- You can do it, Michael.
- You've got to run. Run, Michael, run.

341
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,053
- (all) Run!
- (James) That's it!

342
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:28,098
(George) Yes! He did it!

343
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:31,352
(Jack) Keep running! Keep running!

344
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:36,357
(bells tinkles)

345
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,342
What are you writing about now?

346
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,636
Oh, just making notes.

347
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:10,141
I'm never really certain what they're about
until I've read them over later.

348
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:12,935
Something about the kite?

349
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,149
Now, why do you ask that?

350
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,736
I don't know.

351
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:26,741
If I were a writer I think I could tell
a whole story about flying the kite today.

352
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:31,620
Perhaps you should then. That's
a fantastic idea. Why not give it a try?

353
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:36,334
I hope you haven't been talking about
anything too serious with this one.

354
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:40,629
No. Talking a bit of silliness really.

355
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,349
Can we have him for supper?

356
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,768
Have him to stay for supper, Michael.
We're not cannibals.

357
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,269
You are welcome, you know.

358
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,855
(laughter)

359
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,420
Sylvia. Mr Barrie.

360
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:02,943
Where have you been?

361
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:04,862
Flying a kite, Mother,
and having a wonderful time.

362
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:06,947
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were coming this evening.

363
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:10,200
No? Well, apparently you forgot then.

364
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:13,245
- I brought some supper along for us all.
- You didn't need to do that.

365
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,831
Well, there's no food in the house, is there?

366
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:18,042
Really. You don't need to wait
till the cupboard is bare.

367
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,001
Please, Mother. Come on, darlings.

368
00:25:20,002 --> 00:25:23,130
Wipe feet. There's been
enough tracking round here.

369
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:26,634
George, I thought you said you were going
to help your mother take care of the house.

370
00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:28,844
Coat, Michael, please. Yes.

371
00:25:29,303 --> 00:25:33,557
- And... coat hanger. Good.
- (Michael) Will we see you tomorrow?

372
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:36,644
No. You're going to be helping
round the house tomorrow.

373
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:39,438
Mother, there is absolutely no need for this.

374
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,149
You can't do everything yourself.

375
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,530
Look at you. You're horribly flush.
You're wearing yourself out.

376
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:50,950
Thank you for a lovely day, James.
Excuse me, Mother.

377
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,039
So from tomorrow, we're going to have
some discipline around here.

378
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,669
And not one of you will escape.

379
00:26:06,674 --> 00:26:08,467
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Sarah.

380
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:12,638
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Emma.

381
00:26:20,771 --> 00:26:22,732
You missed supper.

382
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:27,570
Perhaps I'll have something later.
I have a bit of writing I wanted to do.

383
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:31,657
Are you sure? It was a lovely meal. Duck.

384
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:35,745
Sarah let Emma cook this evening.

385
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:40,166
Is that right? Listen, what would you think
of loaning Emma out to the Davies

386
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:41,834
for the occasional evening?

387
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:44,253
They don't actually have a cook.

388
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:48,549
I take it Mrs Davies enjoyed the meal
that she had here?

389
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:55,139
I imagine she could use an extra hand
now and again. That's all.

390
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,850
That's very charitable of you.

391
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:02,063
Perhaps we can send over
some of the silver as well.

392
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,481
And what about linen?

393
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:07,443
I wouldn't be surprised if some of hers
was looking a bit shabby.

394
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:09,737
Please, Mary, stop.

395
00:27:10,905 --> 00:27:14,950
Maybe she can send over
some of the things we've run short on.

396
00:27:14,951 --> 00:27:17,662
My husband, for example.

397
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:21,749
We rarely see him in this house.

398
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,752
That hasn't seemed to bother you
for some time now.

399
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:27,463
(clatter)

400
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:30,633
(rumble of thunder)

401
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:07,545
(carriage draws up, horses whinny)

402
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:15,761
(James) Lords and ladies, His Royal
Highness, King Michael the Benevolent,

403
00:28:15,803 --> 00:28:18,305
protector of the realm.

404
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:21,142
(Peter) That scepter's made of wood.

405
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:24,270
Yes, well, we dream on a budget here,
don't we?

406
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:29,859
No, I mean, everyone thinks it's made
of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

407
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,153
The means to an end, Peter.

408
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:36,157
What we've done is taken
an old hunk of wood

409
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:40,453
and transformed it for all the world to see
into the most magnificent gold.

410
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:45,166
- There you go.
- What's this?

411
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:50,755
All great writers begin with a good
leather binding and a respectable title.

412
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,549
Open it.

413
00:28:56,594 --> 00:28:58,554
"The Boy Castaways."

414
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:03,142
"Being a record of the terrible adventures
of the brothers Davies,

415
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:08,104
faithfully set forth by...
Peter Llewelyn Davies."

416
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:11,067
Kipling would swallow his own ear
for a title like that.

417
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:14,153
Stab him, George. You can do it.

418
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:17,239
I still have no idea what to write.

419
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:20,034
Write about anything.
Write about your family.

420
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:23,037
- Write about the talking whale.
- What whale?

421
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:29,168
The one that's trapped in your imagination
and desperate to get out. Come sit down.

422
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,342
I have actually begun writing about the
adventures of the Davies brothers myself.

423
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,637
- A play?
- A play indeed, yes.

424
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:42,348
And I would be extremely honored

425
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,852
if you would allow me the use of your name
for one of the characters.

426
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:49,647
I don't know what to say.

427
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:51,440
Say yes.

428
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:54,401
Good man.

429
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:56,445
Porthos! That's mine. Let go.

430
00:29:56,779 --> 00:29:59,572
(Michael) I won't go to bed. I won't, I won't.

431
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:04,453
You should have been in bed
half an hour ago, young man.

432
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,748
I'm afraid I've grown hopelessly lax
in my discipline.

433
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:11,043
Nonsense. Young boys
should never be sent to bed.

434
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,255
They always wake up a day older.

435
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:18,467
And then, before you know it,
they're grown.

436
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:20,510
Their father would have been horrified.

437
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:22,638
Of course, he never would have allowed
a dog in the house either.

438
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,558
He'd have tied him up in the yard.

439
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,437
Right! Last one in bed's a hairy toad.

440
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:22,531
You mean a lot to my boys, you know.

441
00:31:24,075 --> 00:31:26,869
Especially Peter.

442
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:31,666
It seems to me
that Peter's trying to grow up too fast.

443
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:39,256
I imagine he thinks that grown-ups don't
hurt as deeply as children do when they...

444
00:31:39,257 --> 00:31:41,634
when they lose someone.

445
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:49,433
I lost my elder brother, David,
when I was just Peter's age.

446
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,561
And it nearly destroyed my mother.

447
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:56,065
James, I'm so sorry.

448
00:31:57,108 --> 00:32:00,945
Your poor mother.
I can't imagine losing a child.

449
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:03,030
Aye.

450
00:32:04,073 --> 00:32:06,450
She didn't get out of bed for months.

451
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:09,161
She wouldn't eat.

452
00:32:09,412 --> 00:32:12,540
I tried everything to make her happy, but...

453
00:32:13,874 --> 00:32:16,252
she only wanted David.

454
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:17,962
So...

455
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:20,131
one day...

456
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,260
I dressed myself in David's clothing

457
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,097
and I went to her.

458
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:32,268
You must have frightened her to death.

459
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:38,232
I think it was the first time
she ever actually... looked at me.

460
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:45,948
And that was the end of the boy James.

461
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:51,245
I used to say to myself
he'd gone to Neverland.

462
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:53,331
Where?

463
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,959
Neverland. It's a wonderful place.

464
00:33:06,886 --> 00:33:10,264
I've not spoken about this before
to anyone.

465
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,767
Ever.

466
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:26,656
What's it like... Neverland?

467
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:32,244
One day I'll take you there.

468
00:33:33,788 --> 00:33:35,456
(Charles) Wait a minute, James.
He's a fairy?

469
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,460
Er, no. He's the irrepressible
spirit of youth. Tinker Bell is the fairy.

470
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:42,546
- Tinker Bell is a woman?
- She's not a woman. She's a fairy.

471
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:45,758
He is a boy who stays young forever.

472
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,135
James, how does anyone
stay young forever? It doesn't work.

473
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:50,930
He just believes, Charles.
He imagines life the way he wants it to be,

474
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:56,435
and he believes in it long enough and hard
enough that it all appears before him, see?

475
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:58,938
James, I'm your friend.
You're coming off a flop.

476
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:03,567
- You have a man who is a fairy.
- No, a boy who has a fairy.

477
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:05,236
And this girl calls herself Tinker.

478
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:09,448
And you have a pirate ship on stage
surrounded by tons and tons of water.

479
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,491
- That's a lot of water.
- It's a lot of water.

480
00:34:11,492 --> 00:34:15,246
- Yes, and that's a lot of money.
- It is, but we can fake the water.

481
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:18,249
Oh, well, if we can fake the water
then I'm sure your play will be a hit.

482
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:21,836
You know what I think I'll do? I think
I'll imagine life the way I want it to be...

483
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:22,837
Long enough and hard enough?

484
00:34:23,004 --> 00:34:27,341
Yes, and then the money for the play
will appear magically before me.

485
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:29,260
- That's right. That's it.
- Yes.

486
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,346
How does the clock wind up
inside the crocodile?

487
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,640
- He swallows it.
- Ah, of course he does.

488
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,269
(men) Out!

489
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:42,105
How was he?

490
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:43,941
- Well done.
- (woman) Good show!

491
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,237
I finally get the courage
to invite the boys to a game

492
00:34:48,238 --> 00:34:51,240
and we have to suffer
this grave humiliation.

493
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,199
It's perfect actually.

494
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,453
Spend a good deal of time with them,
don't you?

495
00:34:55,703 --> 00:34:57,955
Every moment I can spare, in fact.

496
00:34:58,205 --> 00:35:00,333
I'm glad for you.

497
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:04,253
And Mrs Davies seems to be
having a good time of it as well.

498
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:08,841
You should be aware though, James,
what some people have been saying.

499
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,054
Mind you, I wouldn't bring it up
if I thought the rumors would pass.

500
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:16,057
I'm not surprised. What are they saying?

501
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:19,309
V ery well.

502
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,730
That you spend much more time with Mrs
Davies than you do with your own wife.

503
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:25,441
She's a widow. And...

504
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,153
And a friend. That's it. Nothing more.

505
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:35,159
There have also been questions about
how you spend your time with those boys.

506
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:37,453
And why.

507
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:42,541
That's outrageous. How could anyone
think something so evil?

508
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:47,254
They're children.
They're innocent children.

509
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:50,549
You find a glimmer of happiness
in this world,

510
00:35:50,591 --> 00:35:52,969
there's always someone
who wants to destroy it.

511
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:59,433
No. Thank you, Arthur, but I don't think
many will give credence to such nonsense.

512
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,061
Then why is no one sitting with them?

513
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:06,065
Once you get a bit of notoriety, James,

514
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:12,363
people watch you and they will
look for ways to drag you down.

515
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:18,744
(Sylvia) Are you sure your wife doesn't
object to us taking over your cottage

516
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:19,870
for the summer, James?

517
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,331
- She doesn't go there anymore.
- Really?

518
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:25,251
It's such a relief to get away.
You'll come and visit, I hope?

519
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:28,254
- Of course. Are we in?
- Everyone in?

520
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:31,340
- Can I drive, Uncle Jim?
- Er, no.

521
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:32,466
(laughter)

522
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:37,054
(horn)

523
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,566
Out of the way
or I'll make haggis out of you.

524
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:51,152
(Michael) Get the sheep out the way.

525
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:54,155
(horn)

526
00:37:08,502 --> 00:37:12,131
- (Peter) Are we there yet?
- (James) Almost. Almost there.

527
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:15,468
(George) I can see the cottage!

528
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:36,238
- (Jack) Shall we explore, Michael?
- Don't tear your clothes, please.

529
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,241
- Come on. Follow me.
- (Sylvia) Be careful of stinging nettles.

530
00:37:39,283 --> 00:37:40,242
(Jack) Hurry up, everyone.

531
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,960
- Would you like to see the rest of it?
- Mm. Yes.

532
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:13,400
'Ello!

533
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:16,362
Thought you could escape
from Captain Swarthy, eh?

534
00:38:16,404 --> 00:38:20,449
Off to the ship with you, then.
Off to the ship, son!

535
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:27,039
So now you can either choose
to become a pirate with the rest of us,

536
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:30,042
or we'll toss you to the sharks.

537
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:35,464
- (Michael) How marvelous.
- Well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?

538
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:38,968
- No one's escaped, Captain.
- Excellent work, matey.

539
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:39,969
Now then.

540
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:43,431
Now is your only chance to speak.

541
00:38:43,597 --> 00:38:46,934
Who amongst you is ready
to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

542
00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:49,353
- I am!
- Not finished yet.

543
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:52,732
To enter upon
the most dangerous chapter

544
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:56,235
in your young
and soon-to-be-wasted lives?

545
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:57,361
(giggling)

546
00:38:57,611 --> 00:38:59,530
What did you say? What are doing, son?

547
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:02,742
Are you giggling? On my ship?
Giggling? What did you say?

548
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:05,244
- I said I'm ready, Captain.
- What's your name, boy?

549
00:39:05,578 --> 00:39:08,456
I'm Curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

550
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:10,833
Cut him loose, matey.

551
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:15,254
Welcome aboard, Curly.
Your job will be to mop the deck.

552
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:18,341
And who be you, young squire?

553
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:23,929
My name be Nibs the Cut-throat. Feared
by men and greatly desired by the ladies.

554
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:24,847
Jack!

555
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:29,268
Welcome aboard, Nibs.
You shall polish all wood surfaces.

556
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,562
Grab a hold of that rigging.

557
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:35,066
- And you, lad?
- I'm Peter.

558
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:39,862
That's not a pirate name.
What about Dastardly Jim, eh?

559
00:39:39,987 --> 00:39:42,427
No. Just Peter.

560
00:39:42,428 --> 00:39:44,867
I like my name.

561
00:39:45,993 --> 00:39:48,245
V ery well.

562
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:54,168
In punishment for lack of an interesting
pirate name, Peter shall walk the plank.

563
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:56,337
Cut him loose.

564
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:21,362
- What are you playing again?
- The boy.

565
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:22,863
What have you got...? Excuse me.

566
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:26,367
Mr Barrie, sir?

567
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:29,662
There's been a mistake here, sir.
It says here I'm to play the nanny.

568
00:40:29,996 --> 00:40:35,167
- I don't imagine I quite fit that part, eh?
- You're not actually the nanny.

569
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:37,044
You're a dog.

570
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:39,504
- What?
- A Newfoundland.

571
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:41,841
We'll put you in a great big fluffy dog suit.

572
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,468
Rrr.

573
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,638
Oh, right.

574
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:53,060
Actually, we don't have a Tinker Bell cast,
do we? He could play Tinker Bell.

575
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:57,440
Heavens, no. Tinker Bell's a light.
It moves around the stage.

576
00:40:57,441 --> 00:41:00,067
Just a wee light
that moves around the stage.

577
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:05,031
Bit worried about this.

578
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:09,035
(Charles, under his breath) Let's see.
We've got John Darling, Michael Darling,

579
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:12,038
Tiger Lily, Smee, Skylights.

580
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:16,542
It's a play for puppets.
Tootles, Nibs, Curly.

581
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:19,545
All these names are absurd
when you see them all together.

582
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:21,630
Captain Hook, S...

583
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:25,551
(under his breath) Oh, hello, James.

584
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,471
You're out of your mind.

585
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:31,265
(door opens and closes)

586
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:43,235
How were rehearsals?

587
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:48,949
Fine. Great. They're going... quite well.

588
00:41:48,991 --> 00:41:52,370
- Good.
- Yes. Thank you.

589
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:20,731
(coughs)

590
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:24,360
(car approaches)

591
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:33,869
- Hello.
- Hello.

592
00:42:34,495 --> 00:42:38,749
- How was your journey?
- It was quite long. I'm exhausted.

593
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:42,962
- Let's get you some tea.
- That'd be nice. Thanks.

594
00:42:44,088 --> 00:42:49,009
- Can you come to the playhouse?
- In a moment, Michael. He's just arrived.

595
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,931
But I said I'd get him. They always
send Peter to do things. I said I'll do it.

596
00:42:54,307 --> 00:42:58,310
- It will spoil the surprise.
- What surprise, darling?

597
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:02,940
It's a great surprise. We've taken
most of the day preparing for it.

598
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:07,485
- Everybody's waiting for you.
- Then we mustn't keep them waiting.

599
00:43:07,486 --> 00:43:11,866
(gasps) Please don't tell them
that I told you the surprise. I said I wouldn't.

600
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,868
Oh, well, you didn't really tell us
anything about it, did you?

601
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:17,747
- Yes I did. It's a play.
- It's a play?

602
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,334
(medieval music)

603
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,637
(Peter) "The Lamentable Tale
of Lady Ursula."

604
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:35,931
"A play in one act
by Peter Llewelyn Davies."

605
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:42,855
- This is just a bit of silliness, really.
- I should hope so. Go on.

606
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,441
I just wanted to take a stab at writing,
you know.

607
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:48,152
Well, the others do
a good job with it anyway.

608
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:50,363
Well, let's see it then.

609
00:43:52,573 --> 00:43:56,160
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

610
00:43:56,577 --> 00:43:58,578
"One morning, just after sunrise,

611
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:02,166
Lady Ursula, the most beautiful daughter
of Lord and Lady Dubon,

612
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:07,630
made her way up the steps of the great
cathedral to pray to her blessed saint."

613
00:44:08,005 --> 00:44:10,737
"Suddenly, as she reached
the cathedral doors,

614
00:44:10,738 --> 00:44:13,469
the gargoyle that guarded
the sacred structure

615
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:16,347
came to life and swooped down upon her."

616
00:44:16,472 --> 00:44:18,557
(Sylvia coughs)

617
00:44:18,808 --> 00:44:20,935
"The people of the village all ran to safety,

618
00:44:20,977 --> 00:44:23,770
but Lady Ursula slipped
on the cathedral steps

619
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:27,942
and the gargoyle descended upon her,
wrapping her in its huge wings

620
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:32,530
and taking her high up into the spires
of the cathedral."

621
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,158
- Go on, Peter.
- "Not long after this sorrowful event,

622
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:40,955
a young knight named JM Barnaby
came into the city."

623
00:44:41,706 --> 00:44:43,958
Sylvia.

624
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:46,669
- Do you want some water?
- Mother?

625
00:44:46,794 --> 00:44:50,256
- No, James.
- Let's get her back to the house. Go on.

626
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:57,930
She won't discuss it with me at all.
She claims it was nothing.

627
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,890
I tell you, Doctor, she couldn't breathe.

628
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:04,437
You can't very well treat a patient
who won't admit there's anything wrong.

629
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,357
Well, you'll have to make her understand
that something is.

630
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:12,153
- I'll try and do my best.
- Great. Just there.

631
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:45,269
Get your hand flat like that.

632
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:48,356
Ow.

633
00:45:49,398 --> 00:45:51,651
Then... Like that.

634
00:46:16,092 --> 00:46:18,135
(knock at door)

635
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:20,262
Come in.

636
00:46:29,188 --> 00:46:32,858
The good doctor didn't feel
up to the challenge on this one.

637
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:36,654
He thinks you need to go to hospital
for further tests.

638
00:46:36,696 --> 00:46:40,157
Nonsense.
When would I have time for that?

639
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:44,453
Besides, this family's
had enough of hospitals.

640
00:46:45,705 --> 00:46:49,250
- Perhaps they can help you.
- I know what they can do for me.

641
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:52,711
I saw what they did for my husband.

642
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:55,965
No, James. I've no interest in hospitals.

643
00:46:57,174 --> 00:46:59,760
I'm keenly interested
in having some supper.

644
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:04,265
(banging and crashing)

645
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:34,045
What did you and Mother decide
to tell us this time? "It's only a chest cold"?

646
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:36,964
- We hadn't decided anything.
- Stop lying to me!

647
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:40,051
I'm sick of grown-ups lying to me.

648
00:47:40,384 --> 00:47:43,303
I'm not lying to you.
I don't know what's wrong.

649
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:47,767
"Father might take us fishing,"
that's what she said. "In just a few weeks."

650
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,519
And he died the next morning.

651
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,938
That wasn't a lie, Peter.

652
00:47:53,272 --> 00:47:54,272
That was your mother's hope.

653
00:47:54,273 --> 00:47:58,653
He barely moved for a week,
but I started planning our fishing trip.

654
00:47:58,903 --> 00:48:02,865
I will never lie to you. I promise you that.

655
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:06,535
No, all you'll do is teach me
to make up stupid stories

656
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:11,332
and pretend that things
aren't happening until...

657
00:48:14,877 --> 00:48:17,254
I won't! I'm not blind.

658
00:48:17,505 --> 00:48:19,966
I won't be made a fool.

659
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,844
What's this? Peter.

660
00:48:24,178 --> 00:48:26,263
The play.

661
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:30,059
Darling, I wanted to see the rest of it.

662
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:35,231
Magic's gone out of it a bit now,
hasn't it?

663
00:48:35,773 --> 00:48:38,442
All because of a silly chest cold.

664
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:11,267
(speak in low voices)

665
00:49:22,778 --> 00:49:24,655
James.

666
00:49:26,782 --> 00:49:29,160
Well, you remember Gilbert Cannan,
don't you?

667
00:49:29,285 --> 00:49:30,285
Good evening.

668
00:49:30,286 --> 00:49:36,459
Mr Cannan has been working on the
committee to fight government censorship.

669
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:39,253
I know how involved you've been as well.

670
00:49:39,295 --> 00:49:44,550
He wanted to speak to you.
I did think you'd be home so much sooner.

671
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,345
It's been a long evening, Mary.

672
00:49:48,304 --> 00:49:50,264
Yes.

673
00:49:50,306 --> 00:49:52,807
Well, if I'd realized how late it was,
of course.

674
00:49:52,808 --> 00:49:56,062
I should perhaps talk to you
at another time? Not so late?

675
00:49:56,312 --> 00:49:58,356
That will be fine.

676
00:50:00,775 --> 00:50:02,776
We'll talk then.

677
00:50:02,777 --> 00:50:05,655
Thank you for your patience, Mrs Barrie.

678
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,531
Mr Barrie.

679
00:50:07,782 --> 00:50:09,950
- Good night.
- Night.

680
00:50:27,009 --> 00:50:30,033
Well, aren't you going to speak?

681
00:50:30,034 --> 00:50:33,057
What would you like me to say?

682
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:37,269
"Curious how late Mr Cannan stayed,"
I suppose.

683
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:40,856
And then, let's see. What comes next?

684
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,861
"No later than you were out, James."

685
00:50:45,903 --> 00:50:48,656
"And how is Mrs Davies this evening?"

686
00:50:49,573 --> 00:50:51,951
Oh, yes, I would have a great answer
for that one, wouldn't I?

687
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:53,661
How dare you.

688
00:50:56,205 --> 00:50:58,541
This isn't one of your plays.

689
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:02,461
I know that, Mary. It's quite serious.

690
00:51:05,006 --> 00:51:08,134
But I'm not ready for this conversation,
wherever it may lead.

691
00:51:08,509 --> 00:51:13,347
Perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
Good night then.

692
00:51:20,479 --> 00:51:22,565
(door shuts)

693
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:40,810
Mr Barrie. Don't you agree
this is a little bit tight?

694
00:52:40,811 --> 00:52:45,231
- No. No, in fact I think it's quite... baggy.
- Baggy?

695
00:52:45,398 --> 00:52:48,067
Quite frumpy. I'd bring it right in just there.

696
00:52:48,192 --> 00:52:49,735
That's very tight.

697
00:52:50,194 --> 00:52:52,655
And put maybe a plank of wood there
to straighten him up.

698
00:52:52,697 --> 00:52:54,657
- Oh, aye. Yes, Mr Barrie.
- Plank of wood?

699
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:57,034
Some wood there on the shoulders as well.

700
00:52:57,201 --> 00:53:01,038
- Otherwise, it's marvelous.
- Right, sir.

701
00:53:01,998 --> 00:53:03,833
(Porthos barks)

702
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,259
(gasps)

703
00:53:13,384 --> 00:53:16,262
- You'll be sick tomorrow.
- I'll be sick tonight.

704
00:53:16,387 --> 00:53:19,140
(quacking)

705
00:53:20,308 --> 00:53:22,643
James.

706
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:26,564
We're just having some tea.
You remember my mother, of course.

707
00:53:26,772 --> 00:53:29,942
Yes. Of course. How do you do?

708
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:36,157
- May I take your hat?
- (Mrs du Maurier) That's enough, boys.

709
00:53:39,577 --> 00:53:42,038
Boys, please don't run in the house.
You'll break something.

710
00:53:42,371 --> 00:53:44,332
Come away from that door.
Come on, come on.

711
00:53:44,498 --> 00:53:47,668
(Mrs du Maurier) I'd like a word with you,
Mr Barrie, before you go.

712
00:53:47,669 --> 00:53:49,754
We'll only be a few minutes.

713
00:53:50,212 --> 00:53:52,465
Boys, why don't you go
and play in the garden? Go on.

714
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:54,050
- Is he in trouble?
- Sh.

715
00:53:54,508 --> 00:53:58,346
Because I've been alone with Grandmother
and I know what it's like.

716
00:53:58,512 --> 00:54:02,558
- Should we retire into the study?
- Why don't you join them, dear?

717
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,268
V ery well.

718
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:09,857
- I do apologize for interrupting.
- Would you close the door, please?

719
00:54:10,107 --> 00:54:11,608
Certainly.

720
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:16,656
Sylvia has told me you have offered her
the services of your household staff.

721
00:54:16,657 --> 00:54:20,868
- Well, not exactly.
- That won't be necessary.

722
00:54:21,202 --> 00:54:23,371
I'll leave that to Sylvia, of course.

723
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,206
You'll leave that to me, Mr Barrie.

724
00:54:26,207 --> 00:54:29,209
You see, I'm moving in here from now on.

725
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:33,839
- You're moving in?
- I'm going where I'm most needed.

726
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:36,759
And I can certainly see to it
that this house is managed

727
00:54:37,009 --> 00:54:39,261
without resorting to your charity.

728
00:54:39,387 --> 00:54:44,266
It isn't charity, Mrs du Maurier.
I was only trying to help, as a friend.

729
00:54:44,308 --> 00:54:48,562
Have you no idea how much your
friendship has already cost my daughter?

730
00:54:48,771 --> 00:54:51,440
Or are you really that selfish?

731
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:54,235
I beg your pardon?

732
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:58,656
Don't you see what a visit
to the summer cottage of a married man

733
00:54:58,657 --> 00:55:01,742
does for a widow's future prospects?

734
00:55:03,411 --> 00:55:07,331
Sylvia needs to find someone.
The boys need a father.

735
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:14,755
And you are destroying any hope this
family has of pulling itself together again.

736
00:55:14,797 --> 00:55:18,551
I have only wanted good things
for this family, Mrs du Maurier.

737
00:55:18,552 --> 00:55:21,053
I'll look after them.

738
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:25,266
You have your own family
to concern yourself with.

739
00:55:25,308 --> 00:55:27,059
What are you suggesting?

740
00:55:27,101 --> 00:55:31,063
I'm suggesting that you protect
what you have, Mr Barrie.

741
00:55:31,397 --> 00:55:35,151
That is precisely what I am doing.

742
00:55:57,298 --> 00:56:00,968
I was so certain what I would find in this.

743
00:56:01,385 --> 00:56:06,140
Some little confession
would leak out onto the page.

744
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,768
I don't write love notes in my journal.

745
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:11,270
No.

746
00:56:11,395 --> 00:56:14,857
Still, you knew who I meant, didn't you?

747
00:56:14,899 --> 00:56:17,652
That's some comfort, actually.

748
00:56:18,486 --> 00:56:21,155
It means I know you just a little after all.

749
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,950
You needn't steal my journal
to get to know me, Mary.

750
00:56:25,076 --> 00:56:29,538
No. I suppose I could just go see the plays.

751
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:36,754
I was hopelessly naive when I married you.

752
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:43,344
I imagined that brilliant people
disappeared to some secret place

753
00:56:43,345 --> 00:56:47,348
where good ideas floated around
like leaves in autumn.

754
00:56:47,974 --> 00:56:52,645
And I hoped, at least once...

755
00:56:54,105 --> 00:56:56,941
you would take me there with you.

756
00:56:57,108 --> 00:57:00,069
There is no such place.

757
00:57:01,487 --> 00:57:03,531
Yes, there is.

758
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,243
Neverland.

759
00:57:09,704 --> 00:57:12,288
It's the best you've written, James.

760
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:16,335
And I'm sure the Davies will adore
the world you've created for them.

761
00:57:16,794 --> 00:57:19,839
I only wish I were part of it.

762
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,343
I've wanted you to be. I've tried.

763
00:57:27,972 --> 00:57:29,472
Mary.

764
00:57:29,473 --> 00:57:34,353
I always imagined us going off on
great adventures once we were together.

765
00:57:34,478 --> 00:57:38,065
But we moved into this house
and you started, I don't know,

766
00:57:38,607 --> 00:57:42,361
- you started rearranging the furniture.
- What was I supposed to do, James?

767
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:43,821
You were always gone.

768
00:57:43,822 --> 00:57:45,031
I was right here.

769
00:57:45,573 --> 00:57:52,538
Sitting in your parlor, staring off
into other worlds as though I didn't exist.

770
00:57:53,497 --> 00:57:56,042
Look. Just give me bit more time
to finish up the play.

771
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,169
To spend with your muse?

772
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:03,758
No, I'm tired of waiting, James.
I'm tired of looking like a fool.

773
00:58:05,092 --> 00:58:08,346
Well, I can't very well give up the play.

774
00:58:09,472 --> 00:58:12,141
Of course not.

775
00:58:12,475 --> 00:58:17,938
Just come home to me at the end of
the day. Rehearse and be home for dinner.

776
00:58:18,189 --> 00:58:23,069
No more trips to the country,
no more long afternoons in the park.

777
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:27,239
If you can't give us that much of a chance,

778
00:58:27,698 --> 00:58:30,660
then we must end this.

779
00:58:31,494 --> 00:58:34,330
And I will.

780
00:58:39,377 --> 00:58:41,837
Pitiful display.

781
00:58:45,883 --> 00:58:46,968
(whistle)

782
00:58:47,385 --> 00:58:49,553
(James) Nanny. Nanny.

783
00:58:49,554 --> 00:58:51,931
What?

784
00:58:54,392 --> 00:58:57,770
First you get the pajamas,
then you make the bed.

785
00:58:57,771 --> 00:58:59,730
With my paws?

786
00:59:00,189 --> 00:59:04,214
You make the bed with your paws.
The pajamas you get with your teeth.

787
00:59:04,215 --> 00:59:08,239
Because in fact, being a dog,
you haven't any proper digits, have you?

788
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:11,742
Well, I don't have any teeth, either.

789
00:59:11,784 --> 00:59:14,245
I mean, I can't see. I can't breathe.

790
00:59:14,578 --> 00:59:17,748
All I've got is this rubbery snout.

791
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:24,630
- Can we get him some teeth?
- He can have mine.

792
00:59:24,672 --> 00:59:26,841
We'll get you teeth.

793
00:59:27,174 --> 00:59:30,553
- Let's have a wee break, shall we?
- Right.

794
00:59:33,472 --> 00:59:34,849
- I thought you were wonderful.
- You were marvelous.

795
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:37,351
I think you're better on four legs
than you are on two.

796
00:59:37,393 --> 00:59:39,854
- Oh, give it a rest.
- I do.

797
00:59:41,397 --> 00:59:44,358
- Just say it, Charles, go on.
- Well, you picture it, James.

798
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,070
Opening night, doctors, lawyers,
businessmen and their wives,

799
00:59:48,404 --> 00:59:49,864
all dressed to the nines.

800
00:59:49,905 --> 00:59:54,535
They've paid good money, they're
expecting theater, what we call theater.

801
00:59:54,536 --> 00:59:59,165
The curtain opens and it's crocodiles
and fairies and pirates and Indians.

802
00:59:59,373 --> 01:00:02,752
I don't even know what it is.

803
01:00:02,877 --> 01:00:07,131
But you did know, Charles. You're
an absolute genius, Charles. That's it.

804
01:00:07,381 --> 01:00:09,258
Oh, don't patronize me, James.

805
01:00:09,383 --> 01:00:12,345
You know how much money I put into
this show that I haven't even found yet?

806
01:00:12,678 --> 01:00:15,848
Listen, listen. Opening night,
I want 25 seats set aside.

807
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:17,682
- Set aside? 25?
- 25 seats.

808
01:00:17,683 --> 01:00:20,353
Scattered throughout the theater.
Two here, two there, three up there.

809
01:00:20,686 --> 01:00:22,647
- Are they paying for it?
- They're filled.

810
01:00:22,688 --> 01:00:25,066
- No, no, no. I'm asking...
- The seats are filled.

811
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:27,735
- Uncle Jim?
- Hello, boys.

812
01:00:28,194 --> 01:00:29,445
Could I speak to you for a moment,
please?

813
01:00:29,446 --> 01:00:30,863
Certainly.

814
01:00:31,197 --> 01:00:34,158
25 seats, Charles. It'll be great.
It'll be fantastic.

815
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,743
25 scattered seats?
Who's paying for them?

816
01:00:35,744 --> 01:00:36,661
Throughout the theater.

817
01:00:37,203 --> 01:00:40,665
- Who's paying for these 25 seats?
- They're filled-up seats, Charles.

818
01:00:40,706 --> 01:00:42,707
Whoa. Look.

819
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:45,461
This is great. I'm flying.

820
01:00:45,586 --> 01:00:49,840
We don't need to use much pull at all, see?
As long as we've got the balance down.

821
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:52,635
Mother asked me to take the boys out
for the afternoon.

822
01:00:52,802 --> 01:00:55,303
She said she only wanted a bit of quiet,

823
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:59,642
but she was trembling so badly
she couldn't even finish her tea.

824
01:00:59,684 --> 01:01:02,853
I'm not a fool, Uncle James.
I deserve to know the truth.

825
01:01:03,104 --> 01:01:06,440
I don't know the truth.
She won't talk about it.

826
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:08,859
But you think it's serious?

827
01:01:10,987 --> 01:01:13,739
It could be. The doctor felt
she should go and have some tests.

828
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:15,741
Then you'll have to convince her
to go then.

829
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:18,369
I've tried. She won't listen to me.

830
01:01:19,578 --> 01:01:20,578
And lately, to be quite honest,

831
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:25,251
it seems that all my best intentions for
your family have come to nothing but harm.

832
01:01:25,584 --> 01:01:27,753
Apparently I've made
quite a mess of things.

833
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:31,257
It's Grandmother, isn't it?
She's run you off, hasn't she?

834
01:01:31,299 --> 01:01:36,470
Oh, she's absolutely tried with great effort.
And perhaps with good reason.

835
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:39,849
It isn't you, Uncle Jim. She just...

836
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:44,145
She just doesn't want
to see Mother hurt anymore.

837
01:01:47,773 --> 01:01:50,651
Look at that.

838
01:01:50,776 --> 01:01:53,362
How magnificent.

839
01:01:54,488 --> 01:01:56,532
The boy's gone.

840
01:01:58,993 --> 01:02:03,476
Somewhere during the last 30 seconds,
you've become a grown-up.

841
01:02:03,477 --> 01:02:07,960
Right then. I think you should be the one
to talk to her, George.

842
01:02:08,294 --> 01:02:14,050
- But I wouldn't know what to say.
- You'll do fine. You'll do just fine.

843
01:02:14,091 --> 01:02:17,093
Mr Barrie, sir. Sorry to interrupt.

844
01:02:17,094 --> 01:02:21,265
- It's Nana, he's expired backstage.
- What's happened?

845
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,352
I think his costume is too tight.

846
01:02:24,602 --> 01:02:29,940
It's not possible, too tight.
George, give me a minute, I'll be back.

847
01:02:30,107 --> 01:02:32,568
(laughter from the boys)

848
01:02:33,402 --> 01:02:38,032
(stage manager) Pull that one tight.
Here, last one.

849
01:02:39,909 --> 01:02:42,036
OK. Flap those wings.

850
01:02:42,037 --> 01:02:44,163
- There you go.
- Whoa!

851
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:47,458
- Can I have a go?
- Yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

852
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,960
Give that a tug. Go on.

853
01:02:49,001 --> 01:02:51,337
- Just give it a little pull.
- (Michael) Can I have a go?

854
01:02:51,504 --> 01:02:52,838
- In a minute. In a minute.
- Can I have a go?

855
01:02:53,005 --> 01:02:54,966
- Jack. Pull me higher.
- I have to concentrate.

856
01:02:55,007 --> 01:02:56,634
- Stop it now, boys.
- No, Michael.

857
01:02:56,884 --> 01:02:58,344
Stop mucking about, boys. Come on now.

858
01:02:58,386 --> 01:03:00,262
- I want to do it now.
- No, don't go down there.

859
01:03:00,805 --> 01:03:01,931
What are you...?

860
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:06,268
Ow!

861
01:03:10,481 --> 01:03:12,733
(stage manager) Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

862
01:03:12,775 --> 01:03:15,861
- I'm so sorry.
- (Jack) George?

863
01:03:22,076 --> 01:03:23,452
Mr Barrie?

864
01:03:23,577 --> 01:03:27,164
Mrs Davies would like a word with you.

865
01:03:27,498 --> 01:03:29,750
No, just Mr Barrie.

866
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:51,355
- Did you encourage this?
- Encourage what?

867
01:03:51,397 --> 01:03:55,568
Oh, James, please.
You know perfectly well what.

868
01:03:56,402 --> 01:04:02,658
George won't allow them to set his arm
unless I submit to an examination.

869
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:07,246
I see. Well, I suppose you'll have to then,

870
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:12,752
because he's quite a stubborn young man
when he sets his mind to it.

871
01:04:12,877 --> 01:04:17,632
This is absurd.
They won't tell me anything different.

872
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:19,842
Different?

873
01:04:20,009 --> 01:04:22,470
So you've already spoken to a doctor then?

874
01:04:23,012 --> 01:04:25,640
That is not your concern.

875
01:04:31,312 --> 01:04:35,566
(Sylvia, quietly) My understanding
is that my condition may be quite serious.

876
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:40,655
However... my wish is that
life should go on as normal.

877
01:04:41,572 --> 01:04:43,032
So,

878
01:04:43,574 --> 01:04:46,076
I'll have the examination,

879
01:04:46,077 --> 01:04:49,163
and I'll take whatever medications
they advise.

880
01:04:49,164 --> 01:04:51,832
But I don't want to know what they're for.

881
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:56,170
And I don't want you inquiring into it
any further.

882
01:04:57,088 --> 01:04:59,465
Wouldn't dream of it.

883
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:03,260
(clock strikes three)

884
01:05:18,192 --> 01:05:20,236
Mary?

885
01:05:22,196 --> 01:05:24,448
Mary? (knocks)

886
01:05:45,594 --> 01:05:48,431
Peter, could you help George
to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?

887
01:05:48,681 --> 01:05:51,934
- They're in the linen cupboard. Darling?
- Yes, Mother.

888
01:05:51,935 --> 01:05:55,730
Jack, how do you manage
to always come untucked?

889
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,149
Would you check your shirt-tails
in the intermission, please?

890
01:05:58,482 --> 01:05:59,650
Yes, Mother.

891
01:05:59,984 --> 01:06:02,445
You're not planning on attending
any after-theater events, are you?

892
01:06:02,486 --> 01:06:06,157
Only for a short time if we do. The tickets!

893
01:06:06,198 --> 01:06:08,199
- With the children?
- George!

894
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,432
Um, possibly. Would you see
if George has the tickets, please?

895
01:06:11,433 --> 01:06:14,665
- I'll just check the dressing table.
- Sylvia, there's a...

896
01:06:15,207 --> 01:06:19,754
Mother, please see if George has
the tickets. Michael, where are your socks?

897
01:06:19,755 --> 01:06:22,048
Wait here, don't move.

898
01:06:22,882 --> 01:06:25,259
(coughs)

899
01:06:28,512 --> 01:06:30,556
(coughs)

900
01:06:42,693 --> 01:06:45,237
(orchestra warms up)

901
01:06:56,707 --> 01:06:59,543
Take her feet, George.

902
01:07:01,712 --> 01:07:04,048
We'll need some more blankets.

903
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:08,260
Oh, take Michael with you, would you?

904
01:07:10,805 --> 01:07:15,059
She looks much worse
than when we were at the cottage.

905
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:18,311
(George, whispering) Sh, Michael.

906
01:07:18,312 --> 01:07:21,232
- Those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?
- No, sir. Not yet.

907
01:07:21,273 --> 01:07:23,734
Precisely. Have there been
many people asking for seats?

908
01:07:24,402 --> 01:07:25,236
- Yes, sir.
- (James) Charles.

909
01:07:25,403 --> 01:07:27,363
I suggest you start selling them.
Yes, James?

910
01:07:27,488 --> 01:07:29,240
Have you seen any of the Davies family
yet this evening?

911
01:07:29,241 --> 01:07:30,241
The 25 seats, are they filled?

912
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:32,159
- It's taken care of.
- Yes. Yes.

913
01:07:32,493 --> 01:07:35,538
Who did you invite? Because obviously
whoever you invited decided not to come.

914
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:38,165
- The seats will be filled, I promise.
- Yes. You've been promising me all...

915
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:39,667
- Charles?
- Hello, Mr Stanley.

916
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:41,752
Have you seen the Davies family
this evening?

917
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:42,545
No, sir.

918
01:07:43,504 --> 01:07:46,632
- Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.
- Oh, no, Mother. I don't need a doctor.

919
01:07:46,633 --> 01:07:48,551
Yes, you do, dear.

920
01:07:50,511 --> 01:07:53,431
I think I'll get some camomile
to help you relax.

921
01:07:53,472 --> 01:07:57,435
Peter will be here if you need anything.

922
01:08:03,482 --> 01:08:05,067
Peter.

923
01:08:05,484 --> 01:08:07,445
Peter.

924
01:08:15,494 --> 01:08:17,830
Can I do anything, Mother?

925
01:08:17,997 --> 01:08:20,041
No, darling.

926
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,836
You must go to the play.

927
01:08:25,004 --> 01:08:29,050
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

928
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:31,552
I need you to.

929
01:08:31,886 --> 01:08:36,641
I need you to come back tonight
and tell me every bit of it.

930
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:38,391
Please.

931
01:08:38,392 --> 01:08:41,354
It's only a play, Mother.

932
01:08:41,395 --> 01:08:44,231
It doesn't matter.

933
01:08:48,778 --> 01:08:50,946
What do you want?

934
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,033
(Sylvia) Take it out.

935
01:08:56,285 --> 01:08:58,955
Open it.

936
01:09:08,089 --> 01:09:11,467
I've never been so proud of you.

937
01:09:24,772 --> 01:09:27,650
Last call, please, ladies and gentlemen.
Last call.

938
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:30,569
Yes, yes, yes. It's all right. They know.

939
01:09:30,778 --> 01:09:34,532
We had time to sell those 25 seats.
The play's starting.

940
01:09:46,877 --> 01:09:47,837
- Charles.
- What?

941
01:09:47,878 --> 01:09:51,757
- They're here.
- Who's here?

942
01:09:54,885 --> 01:09:58,431
Do forgive them being a bit late -
short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

943
01:09:58,432 --> 01:10:00,558
I'm not clear what they're doing here.

944
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:02,435
- They've come to see the play.
- Mm-hm.

945
01:10:02,436 --> 01:10:04,270
- That's the 25 seats.
- Mm.

946
01:10:04,395 --> 01:10:08,441
25 seats given to orphans. Right.
Now my nightmare is complete.

947
01:10:08,899 --> 01:10:10,860
You can start your play now.

948
01:10:10,901 --> 01:10:12,862
Your play.

949
01:10:17,908 --> 01:10:20,870
(Charles) Get them in the scattered seats.

950
01:10:29,503 --> 01:10:31,964
(overture plays)

951
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:39,138
(usher, whispering) Just there, boys.

952
01:11:10,586 --> 01:11:13,631
(usher) Excuse me, sir. This way.

953
01:11:13,632 --> 01:11:15,633
(Peter) Thank you.

954
01:11:16,092 --> 01:11:19,136
Looks like we got
one of the better-dressed ones.

955
01:11:19,595 --> 01:11:24,058
I just want you to know,
I think you're a wonderful dog.

956
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,352
Thanks.

957
01:11:59,677 --> 01:12:02,430
(barks)

958
01:12:04,598 --> 01:12:07,059
(giggling)

959
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:20,948
(children laugh)

960
01:12:22,491 --> 01:12:24,452
(Nana barks)

961
01:12:25,995 --> 01:12:29,957
- I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.
- (Nana barks)

962
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:31,334
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.

963
01:12:31,876 --> 01:12:34,170
- Two minutes more.
- (Nana growls)

964
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:36,339
Please. One minute more.

965
01:12:36,797 --> 01:12:41,552
Nana, I will not be bathed.
I tell you, I will not be bathed.

966
01:12:41,553 --> 01:12:43,929
(Nana barks, she squeaks)

967
01:12:46,599 --> 01:12:49,143
(actress) Who are you?

968
01:12:55,775 --> 01:13:00,446
No one there. Yet I feel sure I saw a face.

969
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,658
My children.

970
01:13:04,992 --> 01:13:08,245
- How is she?
- She's resting.

971
01:13:08,496 --> 01:13:10,372
- May I see her?
- No, Mr Barrie.

972
01:13:10,373 --> 01:13:13,334
I don't think we need to include you in
everything that goes on in this household.

973
01:13:13,709 --> 01:13:15,753
- But she'd want to see him.
- Be quiet, George.

974
01:13:15,754 --> 01:13:16,963
And since, as I've discovered,

975
01:13:17,004 --> 01:13:20,841
you've seen fit to conceal certain facts
about my daughter's condition from me,

976
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,261
I feel no remorse at excluding you
from my home.

977
01:13:24,262 --> 01:13:25,137
But you can't...

978
01:13:25,596 --> 01:13:29,058
- Go upstairs, George, now.
- Stop ordering me about.

979
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,268
This isn't your home. It's our home.

980
01:13:31,602 --> 01:13:33,562
Just cos Mother's
needed your help recently

981
01:13:33,604 --> 01:13:35,856
doesn't give you the right
to rule over her existence.

982
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:38,234
She's not a child anymore,
and neither am I.

983
01:13:38,609 --> 01:13:40,945
If she wants to see Uncle Jim,
she can see Uncle Jim.

984
01:13:40,946 --> 01:13:43,948
There's nothing you can do about it.

985
01:13:45,408 --> 01:13:47,451
(coughs)

986
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:50,830
- Mother?
- Yes, darling?

987
01:13:53,374 --> 01:13:55,875
James.

988
01:13:55,876 --> 01:13:58,546
No. Your play.

989
01:14:01,382 --> 01:14:04,343
Look at all this.

990
01:14:04,385 --> 01:14:06,637
I'd have come tonight, it's just...

991
01:14:06,887 --> 01:14:09,932
- Mother, you need to rest.
...I still have things to do here.

992
01:14:10,891 --> 01:14:13,893
See? This needs mending.

993
01:14:13,894 --> 01:14:17,440
Four boys, no end of patches.

994
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:20,234
Can't seem to keep up.

995
01:14:21,402 --> 01:14:24,155
I haven't the time for all this.

996
01:14:24,989 --> 01:14:30,870
Don't look at me like that, James.
You make me feel so utterly exposed.

997
01:14:32,705 --> 01:14:38,169
Boys, would you give me a moment
with your mother, please? Thank you.

998
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:00,650
(James) They can see it, you know.

999
01:15:01,984 --> 01:15:04,362
You can't go on just pretending.

1000
01:15:05,488 --> 01:15:08,366
"Just pretending"?

1001
01:15:10,493 --> 01:15:14,330
You brought pretending
into this family, James.

1002
01:15:15,998 --> 01:15:18,960
You showed us we can change things
by simply believing them to be different.

1003
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:21,462
A lot of things, Sylvia, not everything.

1004
01:15:21,504 --> 01:15:24,632
But the things that matter.

1005
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:32,264
We've pretended for some time now
that you're a part of this family, haven't we?

1006
01:15:37,311 --> 01:15:44,360
You've come to mean so much to us all
that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

1007
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:50,157
And even if it isn't true,

1008
01:15:50,992 --> 01:15:53,953
even if that can never be...

1009
01:15:56,497 --> 01:15:59,458
I need to go on pretending.

1010
01:16:01,502 --> 01:16:03,671
Until the end.

1011
01:16:06,007 --> 01:16:08,050
With you.

1012
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:13,347
- (actress) Oh, I am sweet.
- (actor) How do you do it?

1013
01:16:13,681 --> 01:16:18,269
You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts
and they lift you up in the air.

1014
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:21,147
(gasps)

1015
01:16:21,188 --> 01:16:26,652
You are so nippy at it.
Couldn't you do it very slowly once?

1016
01:16:30,573 --> 01:16:34,452
- Yes, I've got it now, Wendy.
- (audience laughs)

1017
01:16:34,577 --> 01:16:37,830
I must blow fairy dust on you first.

1018
01:16:46,088 --> 01:16:47,131
(spits)

1019
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:50,051
Now try. Try it from the beds.

1020
01:16:50,676 --> 01:16:54,555
Just wriggle your shoulders like this
and then let go.

1021
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,140
(she gasps, audience gasps)

1022
01:16:56,307 --> 01:16:59,352
- I flew!
- How ripping!

1023
01:16:59,977 --> 01:17:01,937
Now join hands.

1024
01:17:05,983 --> 01:17:08,861
- Look at me!
- (Michael) I do like it!

1025
01:17:10,988 --> 01:17:14,241
- (man in audience) Bravo!
- (Peter Pan) Let's go out.

1026
01:17:14,575 --> 01:17:18,454
Second on the right
and straight on till morning.

1027
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:20,831
Genius.

1028
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:29,548
- (James) Sylvia, don't move.
- I feel a little better.

1029
01:17:29,674 --> 01:17:33,344
(she sighs) It's been a bad day, that's all.

1030
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:37,640
Now I want you to go back to the theater.

1031
01:17:37,682 --> 01:17:40,267
Find Peter.

1032
01:17:40,309 --> 01:17:44,230
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1033
01:17:47,775 --> 01:17:51,862
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can do for you?

1034
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:54,865
No.

1035
01:17:56,784 --> 01:17:58,285
Well,

1036
01:17:58,286 --> 01:18:01,455
I have always wanted to go to Neverland.

1037
01:18:01,872 --> 01:18:04,959
You did promise to tell me about it,
you know.

1038
01:18:05,501 --> 01:18:08,462
Aye. That I did.

1039
01:18:09,672 --> 01:18:13,050
It's a bit late for it tonight though, I'm afraid.

1040
01:18:14,677 --> 01:18:18,139
Perhaps some time soon though?

1041
01:18:25,104 --> 01:18:27,605
Most definitely.

1042
01:18:27,606 --> 01:18:32,737
- D'you mean we shall both be drowned?
- (Peter Pan) Look how the water is rising.

1043
01:18:36,073 --> 01:18:39,576
It must be the tail of the kite
we made for Michael.

1044
01:18:39,577 --> 01:18:44,832
You remember. It tore itself
out of his hands and floated away.

1045
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:50,630
- The kite. Why shouldn't it carry you?
- Both of us.

1046
01:18:51,589 --> 01:18:54,967
It can't lift two. Michael and Curly tried.

1047
01:18:54,968 --> 01:18:57,637
I won't go without you, Peter.

1048
01:18:58,095 --> 01:19:00,640
Let us draw lots which is to stay behind.

1049
01:19:00,641 --> 01:19:03,559
And you a lady? Never.

1050
01:19:06,604 --> 01:19:08,147
- Ready, Wendy?
- (gust of wind)

1051
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:10,066
Peter!

1052
01:19:10,107 --> 01:19:12,568
Don't let go, Wendy.

1053
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:15,071
Peter, I'm frightened.

1054
01:19:15,112 --> 01:19:17,948
Hang on, Wendy!

1055
01:19:19,575 --> 01:19:21,201
Peter!

1056
01:19:21,202 --> 01:19:24,956
To die will be an awfully big adventure.

1057
01:19:41,389 --> 01:19:43,933
- I'm glad you came.
- Well...

1058
01:19:45,393 --> 01:19:49,063
I've never missed an opening.

1059
01:19:49,064 --> 01:19:50,940
So I...

1060
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:54,944
assume you heard about Gilbert and I.

1061
01:19:54,945 --> 01:19:56,737
Yes.

1062
01:19:57,905 --> 01:20:00,241
Quite the scandal, so I'm told.

1063
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:10,668
How are you?

1064
01:20:15,006 --> 01:20:17,758
I'm all right.

1065
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:20,344
How are you?

1066
01:20:21,512 --> 01:20:24,140
I'm sorry.

1067
01:20:26,976 --> 01:20:29,645
Don't be.

1068
01:20:29,979 --> 01:20:35,067
Without that family, you could
never have written anything like this.

1069
01:20:35,068 --> 01:20:37,570
You need them.

1070
01:20:38,988 --> 01:20:42,533
(applause and cheering)

1071
01:20:44,493 --> 01:20:47,246
Goodbye.

1072
01:20:58,591 --> 01:21:00,843
- Mr Barrie.
- Mrs Snow.

1073
01:21:01,594 --> 01:21:05,431
Thank you. That was quite the nicest
evening I've ever spent in the theater.

1074
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:08,643
V ery kind of you to say. Thank you.
Where's Mr Snow this evening?

1075
01:21:09,101 --> 01:21:10,101
Oh.

1076
01:21:10,102 --> 01:21:12,938
I'm afraid he's left us.

1077
01:21:13,105 --> 01:21:16,067
And he would so have loved this evening.

1078
01:21:16,108 --> 01:21:18,569
The pirates and the Indians.

1079
01:21:19,111 --> 01:21:22,948
He was really just a boy himself, you know.

1080
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:25,368
To the very end.

1081
01:21:25,576 --> 01:21:28,829
I'm terribly sorry. How are you doing?

1082
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:32,999
I'm doing well enough now, thank you.

1083
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,255
I suppose it's all the work
of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?

1084
01:21:38,798 --> 01:21:43,552
Time is chasing after all of us.
Isn't that right?

1085
01:21:44,595 --> 01:21:47,556
- That's right, Mrs Snow.
- Aunt Rose, your drink.

1086
01:21:47,598 --> 01:21:50,935
Thank you. I mustn't keep you.
You've a lot of friends here.

1087
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:54,563
Well, it's lovely to see you.
I'm terribly sorry, once again.

1088
01:21:56,107 --> 01:21:59,860
- Was that Mr Barrie?
- That was Mr Barrie.

1089
01:22:00,111 --> 01:22:02,863
Well done, Mr Barrie.

1090
01:22:03,072 --> 01:22:05,866
- Good show.
- Well done.

1091
01:22:09,287 --> 01:22:12,039
Psst.

1092
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,333
What did you think?

1093
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:17,837
- It's about our summer together, isn't it?
- It is.

1094
01:22:17,878 --> 01:22:20,047
- About all of us.
- That's right.

1095
01:22:21,882 --> 01:22:24,552
Did you like it?

1096
01:22:24,885 --> 01:22:27,555
It's magical. Thank you.

1097
01:22:27,888 --> 01:22:30,266
Oh, thank you.

1098
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:32,143
Thank you, Peter.

1099
01:22:32,393 --> 01:22:36,439
- This is Peter Pan! How wonderful.
- (man) Really?

1100
01:22:36,897 --> 01:22:40,359
You're Peter Pan? Why, you must be
quite the little adventurer.

1101
01:22:40,401 --> 01:22:43,571
(woman) Look, it's true.
He has no shadow.

1102
01:22:44,905 --> 01:22:47,366
But I'm not Peter Pan.

1103
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:49,952
- He is.
- (laughter)

1104
01:23:00,379 --> 01:23:05,051
(man) And there's been no improvement
since my last visit?

1105
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:06,969
(Sylvia) No.

1106
01:23:12,308 --> 01:23:15,770
Has James been by at all today, Mother?

1107
01:23:16,812 --> 01:23:17,730
(knock)

1108
01:23:18,272 --> 01:23:20,441
Dr Brighton. May I have a word?

1109
01:23:22,193 --> 01:23:24,862
Excuse me a moment.

1110
01:23:29,283 --> 01:23:32,745
You haven't been keeping him from me,
have you?

1111
01:23:32,912 --> 01:23:35,039
As a matter of fact,
I actually hoped he might come.

1112
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,833
Would have proved me wrong about him.

1113
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:39,752
Of course, with the success of his play,

1114
01:23:40,211 --> 01:23:44,131
the whole of London
must be knocking at his door.

1115
01:23:47,885 --> 01:23:49,971
I'm sorry, dear.

1116
01:23:53,891 --> 01:23:56,893
- What is it?
- (Michael) It's a secret.

1117
01:23:56,894 --> 01:23:59,855
- (Jack) Quiet, Michael.
- I didn't say anything.

1118
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:02,566
Mother, could you come downstairs
for a moment?

1119
01:24:03,109 --> 01:24:05,861
Oh, she can't come downstairs.
What are you thinking of, George?

1120
01:24:05,903 --> 01:24:10,449
Actually, I think a trip downstairs
might do her good, ma'am.

1121
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:13,160
(coughs)

1122
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:23,170
- (whispers) What have you been up to?
- (Peter) Just wait and see.

1123
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,596
It's a play.

1124
01:24:33,597 --> 01:24:37,435
It's not just a play, Michael. It's the play.

1125
01:24:38,686 --> 01:24:41,939
Of course, we'll have to make do
with a few compromises.

1126
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:44,691
Much of it will have to be imagined.

1127
01:24:44,692 --> 01:24:47,945
- (Peter) As it should be.
- As it should be, that's right.

1128
01:24:55,995 --> 01:24:59,332
(Peter) Michael, come and sit here,
next to Mum.

1129
01:25:03,294 --> 01:25:05,880
When you're ready.

1130
01:25:05,881 --> 01:25:08,466
(overture begins)

1131
01:25:18,392 --> 01:25:21,062
(laughter)

1132
01:25:24,398 --> 01:25:26,359
(Porthos barks, Nana growls back)

1133
01:25:28,903 --> 01:25:30,863
(Porthos whines)

1134
01:25:31,781 --> 01:25:34,367
- I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.
- (Nana barks)

1135
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:39,956
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.
Two minutes more. Please.

1136
01:25:39,997 --> 01:25:43,668
- You know fairies, Peter?
- Yes.

1137
01:25:44,502 --> 01:25:46,837
But they're nearly all dead now.

1138
01:25:47,004 --> 01:25:51,634
You see, Wendy, when the first baby
laughed for the first time,

1139
01:25:52,009 --> 01:25:56,055
the laugh broke into a thousand pieces
and they all went skipping about

1140
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:58,181
and that was the beginning of fairies.

1141
01:25:58,182 --> 01:26:03,646
And now when every new baby is born,
its first laugh becomes a fairy.

1142
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:07,066
So there ought to be one fairy
for every boy and girl.

1143
01:26:07,274 --> 01:26:10,361
- Ought to be? Isn't there?
- Oh, no.

1144
01:26:10,403 --> 01:26:14,949
Children know such a lot now.
Soon, they don't believe in fairies.

1145
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:18,536
And every time a child says,
"I don't believe in fairies,"

1146
01:26:18,911 --> 01:26:22,039
there's a fairy somewhere
that falls down dead.

1147
01:26:22,873 --> 01:26:25,709
(tinkling sound)

1148
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:28,754
- Who is that?
- (tinkling)

1149
01:26:30,298 --> 01:26:32,842
The redskins were defeated?

1150
01:26:33,384 --> 01:26:37,346
Wendy and the boys
captured by the pirates?

1151
01:26:37,471 --> 01:26:40,349
I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her!

1152
01:26:42,476 --> 01:26:45,271
- Oh, that's just my medicine.
- (tinkling)

1153
01:26:45,688 --> 01:26:49,650
Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?

1154
01:26:49,775 --> 01:26:51,569
(tinkling)

1155
01:26:51,777 --> 01:26:55,448
Why, Tink. You've drunk my medicine.

1156
01:26:55,781 --> 01:26:57,574
(tinkling)

1157
01:26:57,575 --> 01:27:00,536
It was poisoned.

1158
01:27:01,579 --> 01:27:04,832
And you drank it to save my life?

1159
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:08,961
Tink.

1160
01:27:10,296 --> 01:27:13,132
Are you dying?

1161
01:27:17,178 --> 01:27:19,555
Her light is growing faint.

1162
01:27:21,182 --> 01:27:25,144
If it goes out, that means she's dead.

1163
01:27:27,396 --> 01:27:31,067
Her voice is so low I can scarcely hear
what she's saying.

1164
01:27:31,068 --> 01:27:34,737
She says she thinks
she could get well again

1165
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:37,531
if children believed in fairies.

1166
01:27:44,288 --> 01:27:47,166
Do you believe in fairies?

1167
01:27:48,709 --> 01:27:51,963
Say quick that you believe.

1168
01:27:54,674 --> 01:27:57,760
If you believe, clap your hands.

1169
01:27:59,387 --> 01:28:02,556
Clap louder.

1170
01:28:07,603 --> 01:28:10,648
Thank you. Thank you.

1171
01:28:53,899 --> 01:28:56,569
(whispers) That is Neverland.

1172
01:30:20,111 --> 01:30:22,863
(James) So many perfect days.

1173
01:30:24,073 --> 01:30:28,661
I really began to believe
we'd go on like that forever.

1174
01:30:29,078 --> 01:30:31,247
Oh, stop it.

1175
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:34,458
She wasn't going to stay with you forever.

1176
01:30:35,293 --> 01:30:38,712
She had a husband. My father.

1177
01:30:38,713 --> 01:30:42,258
She never cared for you
the way she did for him.

1178
01:30:43,384 --> 01:30:46,470
I'm not trying to replace your father, Peter.

1179
01:30:47,013 --> 01:30:49,849
I could never do that.

1180
01:30:57,189 --> 01:30:59,150
You'd best let him go.

1181
01:31:01,902 --> 01:31:07,033
George, would you take the boys back
to the house? I'll be with you in a moment.

1182
01:31:07,408 --> 01:31:09,452
Go on, dear.

1183
01:31:17,001 --> 01:31:19,045
I'm terribly sorry.

1184
01:31:20,004 --> 01:31:23,341
I've ruined everything I've touched
in this family.

1185
01:31:23,507 --> 01:31:26,009
Stop giving yourself so much credit.

1186
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:30,264
Peter's grieving.
It has nothing to do with you.

1187
01:31:31,474 --> 01:31:33,851
Perhaps if I just had
a bit more time with him.

1188
01:31:33,976 --> 01:31:37,146
No, Mr Barrie. That won't be good enough.

1189
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:43,736
If "a bit more time" is all you can provide,
you'd better leave him alone.

1190
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:49,033
I know you don't much care for me,
Mrs du Maurier, and I respect that,

1191
01:31:49,283 --> 01:31:52,870
but I loved your daughter very much.

1192
01:31:53,287 --> 01:31:55,539
And I love those boys.

1193
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:57,750
And I think they need me right now.

1194
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,793
Is that so?

1195
01:31:59,794 --> 01:32:01,963
And for how long after?

1196
01:32:03,297 --> 01:32:05,173
Meaning what?

1197
01:32:05,174 --> 01:32:10,554
Sylvia has requested a co-guardianship
for the boys in her will.

1198
01:32:10,805 --> 01:32:15,267
You, Mr Barrie, and myself.

1199
01:32:17,812 --> 01:32:23,150
- And what do you have to say about that?
- I shall respect my daughter's wishes.

1200
01:32:23,151 --> 01:32:27,863
Something I should have done more of
while she was alive.

1201
01:32:29,573 --> 01:32:31,534
But if you feel you're not ready
for such a commitment,

1202
01:32:31,575 --> 01:32:36,956
I assure you I can certainly
look after the boys by myself.

1203
01:32:37,081 --> 01:32:40,167
Do you think I could abandon those boys?

1204
01:32:49,593 --> 01:32:51,762
Sit down, Peter.

1205
01:33:12,074 --> 01:33:15,536
Mother pasted it back together

1206
01:33:15,537 --> 01:33:17,663
after I ruined it.

1207
01:33:18,873 --> 01:33:20,874
And then I saw the play.

1208
01:33:20,875 --> 01:33:25,755
I just started writing
and I haven't been able to stop.

1209
01:33:27,381 --> 01:33:30,635
She would be very pleased to know that.

1210
01:33:34,388 --> 01:33:38,643
Listen. I've just spoken
with your grandmother

1211
01:33:39,894 --> 01:33:42,063
and I'm staying.

1212
01:33:42,064 --> 01:33:44,857
For good.

1213
01:33:47,401 --> 01:33:49,946
I'm sorry I was so horrible.

1214
01:33:51,197 --> 01:33:53,157
Don't worry.

1215
01:33:56,702 --> 01:33:59,664
It's just...

1216
01:33:59,705 --> 01:34:02,959
I thought she'd always be here.

1217
01:34:04,877 --> 01:34:06,837
So did I.

1218
01:34:08,881 --> 01:34:11,050
But, in fact...

1219
01:34:13,678 --> 01:34:16,096
she is.

1220
01:34:16,097 --> 01:34:21,268
Because she's on every page
of your imagination.

1221
01:34:22,687 --> 01:34:25,856
You'll always have her there. Always.

1222
01:34:31,612 --> 01:34:35,241
But why did she have to die?

1223
01:34:42,373 --> 01:34:44,667
I don't know, boy.

1224
01:34:49,171 --> 01:34:51,632
When I think of your mother...

1225
01:34:52,675 --> 01:34:55,636
I will always remember
how happy she looked

1226
01:34:55,678 --> 01:34:57,847
sitting there in the parlor,

1227
01:34:57,972 --> 01:35:00,850
watching a play about her family.

1228
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:04,854
About her boys that never grew up.

1229
01:35:08,607 --> 01:35:11,068
She went to Neverland.

1230
01:35:13,112 --> 01:35:17,950
And you can visit her any time you like

1231
01:35:18,075 --> 01:35:20,953
if you just go there yourself.

1232
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:26,082
How?

1233
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:29,253
By believing, Peter.

1234
01:35:29,254 --> 01:35:31,547
Just believe.

1235
01:35:44,977 --> 01:35:47,355
(whispers) I can see her.
