325
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,529
What's the point of it all?

326
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,125
Look.

327
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,291
This is Glenn Arias,
an arms dealer.

328
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,488
His deals on the black
market are so shady...

329
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,246
they landed him on a certain
government's hit list.

330
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,249
<i>A smart bomb was dropped
on his wedding.</i>

331
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,131
<i>He lost his family and his wife.</i>

332
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,681
<i>And now he's got a grudge.</i>

333
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,121
<i>After the attack, he
went underground...</i>

334
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,489
<i>but now he's back with B.O.W.s
and a score to settle.</i>

335
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,690
<i>Here's the kicker, he said his
products have targeting capabilities.</i>

336
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,123
<i>From what I've seen,
I believe him.</i>

337
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,207
So you got an arms
dealer on one side...

338
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,050
and on the other...

339

- Arias!

With everything that's going on, you just
sit here and feel sorry for yourself.

345
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,284

We don't need to look for some new virus
that Arias is infecting people with.

354
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,166
The virus is lying dormant
inside of everyone.

355

Even you.

356
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,045
What we need to find
is the trigger.

357
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,081
Something activates the latent virus
and only Arias knows what it is.

358
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,730
But until we find that out...

359
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,602
everyone, living and dead,
are his potential weapons.

360

If we don't figure
this out now...

I created a vaccine. And I tried
it on myself and it works.

364
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,207
But until we find out how
Arias triggers the virus...

<i>It seems under certain
rare conditions...</i>

483
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,884
<i>the latent virus can activate
without the trigger virus.</i>

484
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,449
Speaking of, the trigger virus is
probably distributed through the air...

485
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,604
<i>by a gas.</i>

486
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,364
By themselves, these viruses
either have no potency...

487
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,966
or they run the risk of
activating on their own.

488
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,360
But when combined...

489
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,289
they become an effective,
controllable bioweapon.

490
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,086

to control where it goes or who gets it.

494
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,721
So then Arias has to be
using some type of vaccine.

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,004
He vaccinates anyone he
doesn't want infected first.

498
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,528
Which makes for a more
accurate weapon. See?

It wasn't hard for me to
engineer a test cure.
