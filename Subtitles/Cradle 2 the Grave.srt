Every aircraft that takes off...

793

And this is the answer.

A unique, man-made element.
In its present state it's completely inert.

One small fragment easily transformed

radioactive isotope...

...requires altering the atomic structure
of the original material.

Normally this is accomplished
by adding neutrons.

Here, we're using electromagnetic
distillation to strip away protons.

In the process, the fragment's potential
yield is increasing exponentially.

We're now reaching the yield level
of a sidewinder missile.

Guess I'll be spending some time in jail.

934
01:35:30,601 --> 01:35:31,644
Jail?

935
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:36,273
Come on, man. He just saved the planet,
man. Can't he at least get probation?

936
01:35:36,482 --> 01:35:37,650
I'll do what I can.

937
01:35:37,817 --> 01:35:38,984
- Thanks.
ARCHIE: Great.

938
01:35:39,151 --> 01:35:42,321
Because we make a hell of a team,
am I right? Except for you.

939
01:35:42,488 --> 01:35:45,157
You're law enforcement.
But we gotta stick together.

940
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:47,493
And a white guy comes in handy.

941
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:51,455
You wanna rip off a country club,
or somebody needs to hail a cab. Right?

942
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:53,874
- So, what percentage are we talking?
- None.

943
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:55,793
That low, huh?

944
01:35:57,837 --> 01:36:00,214
It's about time I got my shit together.

945
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:03,843
- About time we all did.
- I'm with you, T.

946
01:36:04,844 --> 01:36:07,596
Come on, buddy, it's just getting fun.

947
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:10,766
Well, I mean, you know,
it's not that fun...

948
01:36:14,979 --> 01:36:17,189
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

949
01:36:19,483 --> 01:36:20,568
Faith.

950
01:36:20,776 --> 01:36:21,819
Faith.

951
01:36:22,987 --> 01:36:25,906
Faith.

952
01:36:26,323 --> 01:36:27,616
Faith.

953
01:37:32,515 --> 01:37:34,934
So you guys are all just gonna
up and go straight?

954
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,353
Yeah. You ought to try it yourself, man.

955
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,980
I could do it. I've had straight jobs
Have you?

956
01:37:40,147 --> 01:37:43,067
- I've had plenty of straight jobs
- Really? Name one.

957
01:37:44,235 --> 01:37:45,778
I sold Avon.

958
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:49,532
- You were an Avon lady?
- I was an Avon man. All right?

959
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:51,951
- You got a problem with that?
- No, it's fair.

960
01:37:52,117 --> 01:37:54,203
- Why you looking at me like that?
- It's okay.

961
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:56,664
TOMMY:
All right. All right.

962
01:37:56,914 --> 01:38:01,835
I'm just fucking with you. But my mama
sold Avon. Don't be disrespecting her.

963
01:38:02,002 --> 01:38:04,672
- I know her. Remember the party?
- She whipped your ass.

964
01:38:04,838 --> 01:38:06,382
No, she sucker-punched me.

965
01:38:06,549 --> 01:38:09,677
That ain't the first time you
been sucker-punched by a big woman.

966
01:38:09,843 --> 01:38:12,429
You know, I think
I got kind of a fetish.

967
01:38:12,638 --> 01:38:15,140
Did you just say my mama had a fat ass?

968
01:38:15,307 --> 01:38:19,103
No, I said I have a kind
of a fetish for big women.

969
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:22,481
- Oh. But she do got a fat ass though.
- Yeah, she does have a fat ass.

970
01:38:22,648 --> 01:38:25,150
You can see it when she's sitting
on your head.

971
01:38:25,317 --> 01:38:28,946
I've seen it. I had to rub that ass
naked when I was a teenager.

972
01:38:29,113 --> 01:38:32,366
You know, you look a lot like her.
Except her hair is different.

973
01:38:32,533 --> 01:38:36,245
Yeah. I shave my beard,
she keeps hers growing.

974
01:38:36,412 --> 01:38:38,497
- Yeah. You know what?
- What?

975
01:38:38,664 --> 01:38:43,502
I'm gonna write a movie about the shit
we got through. I've been taking notes.

976
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:46,755
It's gonna make a lot of money.
I'm calling it <i>Sidekicks.</i>

977
01:38:46,922 --> 01:38:49,883
We're the real stars of this.
We shot down the damn helicopter.

978
01:38:50,050 --> 01:38:52,928
- Who's playing you?
- I've been thinking about that.

979
01:38:53,095 --> 01:38:56,390
I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger,
then I saw him at the gas station--

980
01:38:56,557 --> 01:38:57,933
- Midget.
- He's like 5'6...

981
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,977
- Midget.
- Got a terrible lisp.

982
01:39:00,144 --> 01:39:02,688
So I'll go with Mel Gibson.
We have similar features.

983
01:39:02,855 --> 01:39:04,565
Right. I see the forehead.

984
01:39:04,732 --> 01:39:07,026
- Yeah. And you? Guess.
- Denzel!

985
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:08,277
Denzel!

986
01:39:08,444 --> 01:39:11,864
- You noticed I've been cutting it down.
- And he's been beefing up.

987
01:39:12,031 --> 01:39:16,744
- I try to get down to Denzel's weight.
- Know who'll be your girlfriend? Oprah.

988
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,912
- Big Oprah or little Oprah?
- Medium Oprah.

989
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:21,248
That's the one I like.
The eyes are straight.

990
01:39:21,415 --> 01:39:23,542
- This is about reality.
- Right. Realism.

991
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:25,878
- Yeah. So you know who's my girlfriend?
- Who?

992
01:39:26,045 --> 01:39:29,882
Halle Berry. And let me tell you why.
It'll add a whole different element.

993
01:39:30,049 --> 01:39:32,885
This is an interracial couple.
She's never done that before.

994
01:39:33,177 --> 01:39:34,261
- Uh-huh.
- Also, Fait.

995
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:37,890
I've been thinking about
that a lot. I'll go with Shaquille O'Neal.

996
01:39:38,057 --> 01:39:41,352
The most dominating player ever
in the NBA. You saw Kazaam.

997
01:39:41,518 --> 01:39:43,646
- Right
- It wasn't the right material.

998
01:39:43,812 --> 01:39:47,566
He's gonna kill with this stuff.
And Su, I've been thinking about him.

999
01:39:47,733 --> 01:39:50,402
<i>- Remember the movie Sixteen Candles?
- Yeah.</i>

1000
01:39:50,569 --> 01:39:52,905
- Who am I thinking about?
- Molly Ringwald?

1001
01:39:53,072 --> 01:39:55,074
- No, the Donger!
- Oh! Okay!

1002
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:57,826
How funny was that guy?
What happened to him?

1003
01:39:57,993 --> 01:40:00,329
- He waiting tables someplace.
- He was funny!

1004
01:40:00,496 --> 01:40:04,583
- Yeah, he was. Hey, Daria.
- Daria? Who you got?

1005
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:07,503
- Winona Ryder.
- Yeah, she's good. She'd be good.

1006
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:09,922
- Yeah, she's good.
- She'd play a thief.

1007
01:40:10,089 --> 01:40:13,300
She'd play a thief. She a good actress.
The whole elbow thing.

1008
01:40:13,467 --> 01:40:16,929
Remember when she's going to court
and hit the one elbow, broke that elbow.

1009
01:40:17,096 --> 01:40:20,933
- Electricity went through her body.
- She's a ventriloquist with the elbows.

1010
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:23,352
Now who do we get to direct this thing?

1011
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:25,104
You know what?

1012
01:40:25,354 --> 01:40:29,608
<i>We should get the dude that directed
Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds.</i>

1013
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:32,361
- The director, the Pole, Polack.
- The Polack?

1014
01:40:32,528 --> 01:40:35,280
Yeah, we'll get him in there.
<i>Exit</i> Wounds, did you see that?

1015
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:37,032
- I saw that.
- The best part--

1016
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,283
- The end.
- The very end.

1017
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:42,579
- Over the credits. The rest sucked.
- Can't have the movie without the end.

1018
01:40:42,746 --> 01:40:45,833
- There's no movie.
- Whatever happened with those guys?

1019
01:40:45,999 --> 01:40:47,167
I heard they're gay.

1020
01:40:48,544 --> 01:40:50,754
Yeah, of course. Hollywood.

1021
