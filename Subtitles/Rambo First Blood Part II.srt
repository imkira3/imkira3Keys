2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,083
Let's keep those hammers working.

3
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,063
Rambo!

4
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,901
Let's go.

5
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,092
How are you, Johnny?

6
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,218
Good.

7
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,971
That's all.

8
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,269
John, I'm sorry they sent you
to such a hellhole.

9
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,690
- I've seen worse.
- Yeah, you have, haven't you?

10
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,277
John, I told you
that I'd help you when I could.

11
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,530
You interested?

12
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:01,203
You can't possibly want to stay here
for another five years.

13
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,295
In here, at least I know where I stand.

14
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,506
Yeah, just hear me out first.

15
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,593
A covert operation's
gearing up in the Far East.

16
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:21,682
Your name was dug out as one of three
most able to complete the mission.

17
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,478
- Mission?
- Recon for POWs in Nam.

18
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,443
Why now? Why me?

19
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,490
Prison camp you escaped from
in '71 is a target area.

20
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,410
Nobody knows that terrain
better than you do.

21
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,497
The risk factor's very high.
You'd be temporarily reinstated.

22
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:50,085
If the mission's successful,
there may be a presidential pardon.

23
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,547
You interested?

24
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,097
Yeah.

25
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,808
Good. Good.

26
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,352
I'll get the necessary clearance.

27
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,732
Next we'll meet with a Special Ops
designate who haunts the operation.

28
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,275
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,694
- All clear?
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,198
I want you to know I did what I could
to keep you outta here.

31
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,825
I know.

32
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,744
- Yeah.
- Sir?

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,539
Do we get to win this time?

34
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,460
This time, it's up to you.

35
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:59,613
[RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART II]

36
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,137
That'll be all.

37
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,682
How you doing, Rambo?
I'm Ericson.

38
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,602
Why don't we make it
over to the hangar?

39
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,148
So, you're the chosen one, huh?

40
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:02,110
You made a hell of a rep
for yourself in Nam.

41
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,905
Anyway, I'm glad to be
working with you.

42
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,992
It may not be heaven,
but at least you're outta the joint.

43
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,707
He's here.

44
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,796
- Morning, John.
- Sir.

45
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,091
Murdock's in charge of Special Ops
from Washington.

46
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,469
Thank you. Rambo,
been looking forward to meeting you.

47
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,721
- Problems on your trip?
- No.

48
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,141
Except for the damn heat, right?
Never felt anything like it.

49
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,894
Come on in.
Let's get down to business.

50
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,565
I was glancing over your files.

51
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,653
Makes for some pretty interesting reading.

52
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:55,080
"Rambo, John J., born 7/6/47, Bowie,
Arizona, of Indian-German descent."

53
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,165
That's a hell of a combination.

54
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,712
"Joined the army 8/6/64. Accepted Special
Forces. Specialization - light weapons.

55
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,424
"Medic. Helicopter, language-qualified.

56
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,177
"59 confirmed kills, two Silver Stars,
four Bronze, four Purple Hearts,

57
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,098
Distinguished Service Cross,
the Medal of Honor."

58
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,351
You got around, didn't ya?
That's incredible.

59
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,856
You're probably aware
that almost 2500 Americans

60
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,108
are still MIA in Southeast Asia.

61
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,445
Most are presumed killed,
but to the League of Families,

62
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,782
Congress and lots of Americans,
it's still a very emotional issue.

63
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,076
Give me something cold, please.

64
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:37,289
Rambo, you certainly don't know
as much about me as I do you.

65
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:41,585
I honched with the 2nd Battalion
3rd Marines in Kon Tum in '66.

66
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,172
I lost a lot of good men,
so I know what you and every vet feels.

67
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:50,677
Maybe the government and certain
segments of the population didn't care.

68
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,137
My committee cares.

69
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,307
What it needs is proof
that Americans are being held.

70
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,934
Once done, we'll get our men back.

71
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,854
If there's any of our men
at this POW target camp,

72
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,566
you're to confirm their presence
by taking photographs.

73
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,651
- Photographs?
- Photographs.

74
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,739
Under no circumstances
are you to engage the enemy.

75
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,994
- I'm supposed to leave 'em there?
- I repeat, do not engage the enemy.

76
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,039
Phase two Delta Force assault
led by Colonel Trautman

77
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,917
will handle the extraction.

78
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,251
OK?

79
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,758
I'd like to say
that I feel with your participation,

80
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,260
this mission has
a better-than-average chance

81
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,055
to succeed where others have failed.

82
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,934
I'll meet you both
in the operations center in one hour.

83
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,038
Thailand across Laos into
the mountains of Vietnam to the drop zone.

84
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,542
You'll be flying a ceiling of 250 feet
when you bail out.

85
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,920
- Think you can you handle it?
- Try.

86
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:11,550
Since you're going in solo, you'll rely
on more equipment than ever before.

87
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,762
And use it.
Don't try the blood-and-guts routine.

88
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,890
Let technology do most of the work.

89
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,435
I want you to try to forget the war.
Remember the mission.

90
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,816
- The old Vietnam's dead.
- Sir, if I'm alive, it's still alive, isn't it?

91
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,080
You may find this hard to believe,
but all this is for you.

92
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,332
Impressed?

93
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,418
Besides monitoring devices,

94
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:50,880
you'll get all the ultramodern equipment
we have to insure your safety.

95
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:56,469
You can feel totally safe. We have the
world's most advanced weapons available.

96
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,265
I've always believed
the mind is the best weapon.

97
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,393
- Times change.
- For some people.

98
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,521
Don't let me interrupt.

99
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,316
Upon insertion,
call into base camp on Transat,

100
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,111
then proceed to Hawk September
to rendezvous with your contact,

101
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,447
indigenous agent Co Bao.

102
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,824
Is he listening?

103
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,160
Indigenous agent Co Bao.

104
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,964
Colonel. Are you sure he's still
not unbalanced from the war?

105
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:37,135
We can't have somebody who might
crack under pressure in that hell.

106
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,970
Pressure?

107
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,973
Rambo is the best combat vet
I've ever seen,

108
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,645
a pure fighting machine who only desires
to win a war that someone else lost.

109
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:51,274
And if winning means he has to die,
he'll die - no fear, no regrets.

110
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,653
And one more thing.

111
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,658
What you choose to call hell,
he calls home.

112
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,580
Stand by to start APU.

113
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,398
T minus 20.

114
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,422
Switching now.

115
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,548
Analyze.

116
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,931
T minus 5.

117
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,241
You've got 36 hours
to get the hell in and out.

118
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,703
- So don't stop and smell the roses, OK?
- Yeah.

119
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:31,291
Run into trouble, try to get to the hilltop
extraction site marked on your map.

120
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,376
Ready to roll, Colonel.

121
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,508
- Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

122
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,594
Let's go.

123
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:49,350
Murdock said he was with 2nd battalion
3rd Marines at Kon Tum in '66.

124
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,602
Yeah.

125
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,146
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.

126
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,941
You're the only one I trust.

127
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,154
- Think he'll find someone?
- POWs? Doubtful.

128
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:48,284
But there's people to satisfy,
questions that have to be answered.

129
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,080
- You don't sound too emotional about it.
- Wasn't my war.

130
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,749
I'm just here to clean up the mess.

131
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,712
AWACS 25 has arrived.
Holding time line.

132
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,507
- Insertion minus one.
- Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.

133
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,294
Back in the badlands, my man.

134
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,088
Stand by your position.

135
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,549
Insertion minus 15 seconds.

136
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,635
Party time.

137
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,776
Five seconds. 4, 3, 2...

138
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,986
Jumper away.

139
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,003
- What's happening?
- Turbulence! He's hung up!

140
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,966
He'll be torn apart.

141
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,051
Condition red. He's hung up.

142
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,761
- What?
- What happened?

143
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,389
He's being dragged.

144
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,935
- Lifer, cut him loose.
- I can't free him!

145
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,625
- Ericson, abort mission. Pull out.
- He'll be torn apart.

146
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,006
He's cutting away his equipment.

147
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,602
He's out!

148
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,105
This is Dragonfly 1.
Do you read? Over.

149
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,274
Dragonfly 1, come in.
I read you.

150
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,609
- Any visual by flares?
- Negative.

151
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,695
We didn't see anything.

152
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,956
Maybe it's smart to abort
before there's any more complications.

153
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,083
Who could have survived that?

154
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,252
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

155
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:31,299
He's got 36 hours to complete the mission
and reach the extraction point.

156
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,218
- We owe him that.
- Well, of course we do.

157
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,223
But understand something now.
In 36 hours, we pull out.

158
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,580
Rambo!

159
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,096
Did not expect a woman, no?

160
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,100
We'd better go.

161
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,189
Go to river.

162
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,649
How come you so late?

163
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,735
Got hung up.

164
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,618
I have arranged boat to take us down river.

165
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,703
Old ways not safe.

166
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,790
You come a long way, Rambo,
to see empty camp.

167
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,428
You're using pirates?

168
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:08,432
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.

169
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,515
What about patrol boats?

170
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,455
Russian.

171
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,318
Rambo.

172
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,404
Want to eat?

173
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,615
Maybe later.

174
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,419
How you get into this?

175
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,589
- It's a long story.
- Long ride.

176
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:52,012
Well, after I left the Special Forces,

177
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,306
I moved around a lot.

178
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,601
Why you leave army?

179
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,480
When I... came back to the States,

180
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,734
I found there was
another war going on.

181
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,863
What war?

182
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,908
Kind of like a quiet war,

183
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,205
a war against...
all the soldiers returning.

184
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,041
That's the kind of war you don't win.

185
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,798
It's... it's my problem.

186
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,468
How about you?
How'd you get into it?

187
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,721
My father worked for intelligence agency.

188
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,726
He killed, and I take his place.

189
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,480
It's too much death here.

190
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,857
Death everywhere.

191
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,404
Just want to live, Rambo.

192
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,159
Maybe go America.

193
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,244
Live the quiet life.

194
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,791
What you want?

195
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,253
Well, to win.

196
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,672
To survive.

197
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:13,302
Not so easy to survive. Still war here.

198
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,471
To survive a war,

199
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,848
you gotta become war.

200
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,477
That why they pick you?
'Cause you like to fight?

201
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,648
No, I'm...

202
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,484
I'm expendable.

203
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,070
Expendable.

204
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,781
What mean "expendable"?

205
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:39,578
It's like if someone invites you to a party,

206
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,998
and you don't show up,

207
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,084
doesn't really matter.

208
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,718
What is this?

209
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,137
It bring me good luck.

210
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,641
What bring you good luck?

211
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,484
I guess this.

212
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,911
- No further reports.
- I wanna go out with the extraction team.

213
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,038
- Denied.
- Denied?

214
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,749
- Unnecessary risk.
- We have a schedule to keep.

215
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,378
- We don't know if Rambo's alive.
- The odds are against it.

216
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:33,299
You said we'd go through as planned.

217
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:37,511
OK. If you want to go
through with it, we will.

218
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,848
Colonel's joining the extraction team.

219
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,020
You're a damn good man, Trautman.

220
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,912
See? Camp empty.

221
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,873
We move closer.

222
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,003
Cycle girl whore from village.

223
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,301
Come on.

224
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,737
- What is it?
- A bow. No sound.

225
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:11,415
You're not going in there. But I thought
you're supposed only to take pictures.

226
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,252
- What about orders?
- No more orders, Co.

227
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,853
I've come to get you out.

228
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,730
Don't talk.

229
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,178
- There are others.
- I'll be back.

230
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,097
Come on.

231
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,156
All right. Let's go.

232
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:56,486
- You have clearance.
- Minus one hour to extraction.

233
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:00,031
I hope for his sake
we're not just wasting fuel.

234
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,117
Let's get moving.

235
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,727
- Good thing you came when you did.
- Why is that?

236
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,313
They move us around
to harvest the crops.

237
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,816
- Only been there a week.
- When's the last time you were there?

238
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,194
A year. Yeah.

239
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,989
- What year is it, anyway?
- 1985.

240
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,329
Camp's supposed to be empty.

241
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,624
Yeah, it's supposed to be.
Come on.

242
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,866
LZ two clicks up river.

243
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,306
- What has happened?
- We've been sold out.

244
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,934
You little bastard.

245
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,096
All right, jump!

246
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,016
- I fight.
- Jump! Go on!

247
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,324
The boat - it's gonna blow!

248
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,759
Jump!

249
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,565
You made it, Rambo!

250
00:40:51,699 --> 00:41:14,220
Come on.

251
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,311
Here. You take this.
We go on from here.

252
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:25,064
- It better I stay till end.
- This is the end.

253
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,984
Come on, let's go.

254
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,487
Rambo.

255
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,697
You not expendable.

256
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,306
Colonel, three minutes.

257
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,066
Come on.

258
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,244
Move.

259
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,839
That's Rambo.

260
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,179
Christ, he's found one.

261
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,526
Come on.

262
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,795
Rambo's found one of ours.

263
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,132
Dragonfly reports the ground crew
has what appears to be

264
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,676
an American POW with him.

265
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,972
- What did you say?
- They've got one of ours.

266
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,976
Condition Bravo.
Meyers, Harrison, Goodell.

267
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,396
Everybody, out! Come on, move!

268
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,940
COMINT priority frequency.
Give me the mike.

269
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:19,989
Dragonfly, this is Coach 1. This is
an Alpha Kilo Victor command priority.

270
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,242
Come on!

271
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,999
Abort the mission immediately.
I say again, this is a recall.

272
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,628
- Confirm. Over.
- Say again, Coach 1. Say again.

273
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,672
I'm telling you to abort.

274
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,841
Colonel, I've been ordered
to abort before pickup.

275
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:43,096
For chrissake, we've got him in sight.
Murdock, do you read?

276
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,974
Come on!

277
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,977
- We're going down.
- You're not going anywhere.

278
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,400
You goddamn mercenaries.

279
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,194
- There's men down there! Our men!
- Come on!

280
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,698
No, your men. Don't be a hero.

281
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,791
Down. Don't leave!

282
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,421
Come on!

283
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:56,252
What are you doing?
Do you know what the hell you've done?

284
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,088
Don't act so innocent.
You had your suspicions.

285
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,216
And if you suspected then,
you're an accessory.

286
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,261
Don't ever count me
with you and your scum.

287
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,514
It was a lie, wasn't it?
Just like the whole damn war!

288
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,059
- It was a lie.
- What are you talking about?

289
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,896
That camp was supposed to be empty.

290
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,899
Rambo goes in, a decorated vet.

291
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,860
He finds no POWs.
Congress buys it. Case closed.

292
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,154
He gets caught, nobody knows he's alive

293
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,616
except you and your computers,
and you can reprogram that.

294
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,744
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to, Trautman?

295
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,538
A stinking bureaucrat
trying to cover his ass.

296
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:36,209
No, not just mine, Trautman.
We're talking about a nation's.

297
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:41,214
It was your hero's fault. If your warrior had
done what the hell he was supposed to,

298
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:46,135
we'd be out of this clean and simple.
He was just supposed to take pictures.

299
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,765
If they showed something,
they would have been lost, wouldn't they?

300
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,768
I don't think you understand
what this is all about.

301
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,813
The same as it always is - money.

302
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:00,483
In '72, we were supposed to pay the Cong
4.5 billion in reparations.

303
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,402
We reneged. They kept the POWs.

304
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,823
And you're doing the same thing
all over again.

305
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,450
What would you do?
Pay blackmail money

306
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,788
to ransom our own men and finance
the war effort against our allies?

307
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,833
What if some burnout POW
shows up on the 6:00 news?

308
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,919
What do you wanna do,
start the war over? Bomb Hanoi?

309
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,338
Want everybody screaming for invasion?

310
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,341
Do you think somebody
on the floor of the senate

311
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,803
will ask for billions of dollars
for some forgotten ghosts?

312
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,514
Men, goddamn it!
Who fought for their country.

313
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,850
That's enough!

314
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:38,855
Trautman, I'm gonna forget
this conversation ever took place.

315
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,526
- You bastard.
- And if I were you,

316
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,779
I'd never make the mistake
of bringing this up again.

317
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:51,492
- You're the one making the mistake.
- Yeah, what mistake?

318
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,244
Rambo.

319
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,598
Damn Russian bastards.

320
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,041
He's dead now.

321
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,136
Bring him up.

322
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:58,703
The knife. These people are so vulgar
in their methods.

323
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,788
They lack compassion.

324
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,877
I am Lieutenant Colonel Podovsky.

325
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:13,092
I do not know who you are yet, but I will.

326
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,096
Take him and clean him up.

327
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,631
That's all.

328
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,760
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.

329
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,769
I see you are no stranger to pain.

330
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,606
Perhaps you have been among
my Vietnamese comrades before?

331
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,778
No answer.

332
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,363
Do you wish to give your name?

333
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:20,159
Now, what possible harm
can that cause?

334
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,791
Pride is a poor substitute
for intelligence.

335
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:31,420
What you must understand
is that we have to interrogate you.

336
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,717
To Sergeant Yushin, you are a piece
of meat, a laboratory experiment,

337
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:40,763
but to me, you are a comrade,
similar to myself,

338
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,683
just opposed by an act of fate.

339
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,687
I know you are trying
to facilitate the release

340
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,774
of war criminals
held by this republic.

341
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,110
I can appreciate this,

342
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:58,364
but this incident - your capture - is...

343
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,951
...embarrassing.

344
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,036
We must have explanation.

345
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,456
First of all, I wish you
to radio your headquarters

346
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:13,003
and say that you have been captured
and condemned for espionage activities,

347
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:17,716
and that no such criminal aggression
should be attempted in the future,

348
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:22,513
or they will meet
with the same fate as yours.

349
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,357
Fuck you.

350
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,154
You wish to test your strength.

351
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,906
Good. Good.

352
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,661
Yushin.

353
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:51,185
Comrade, here is something
that might be of interest to you -

354
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,479
a transcript of the conversation

355
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:59,151
between your helicopter pilot
and his commander we intercepted.

356
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,280
Dragonfly. Wolf Den.

357
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,616
Colorful names.

358
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,536
Here we are.
"We have them in sight."

359
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:14,458
And the reply.
"Abort the operation immediately."

360
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:19,505
"This is a recall. Confirm.
Over."

361
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:24,677
It seems you were abandoned
on direct command.

362
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,807
And these are the people
you protect with your pain.

363
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:38,232
You may scream. There is no shame.

364
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:12,099
You are strong, very strong,

365
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:16,437
the strongest so far,
but you're nearly dead.

366
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:20,566
For what?
Make a radio call.

367
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:50,137
To talk, to obey
would be so much easier.

368
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,555
Yushin!

369
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:07,988
Yushin has a momento for you
of this occasion.

370
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,471
Put it in his eye.

371
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:43,565
If your life means nothing to you,
then perhaps his does.

372
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,734
Don't tell them anything.

373
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,320
You will talk.

374
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,747
Yes?

375
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,742
Don't do it.

376
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,331
Do it now.

377
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:13,197
220... 56.

378
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,325
Lone Wolf. Receive.

379
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,954
This is Lone Wolf. 22056.

380
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,584
Lone Wolf, this is Wolf Den.
Transmit location and status. Over.

381
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,878
- What is it?
- It's Rambo, sir.

382
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,796
...Receive. Over.

383
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:33,091
We read you, Lone Wolf.
What is your position? Over.

384
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,554
I say again, what is your position?
Over...

385
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,809
Your friend dies if you do not answer.

386
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,520
Lone Wolf.

387
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,813
Johnny, where the hell are you?

388
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,986
John, come in.

389
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,996
Murdock?

390
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,291
He's here.

391
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,839
This is Murdock.
We're glad you're alive.

392
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:17,970
Where are you? Give us your position,
and we'll come to pick you up.

393
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,105
Murdock...

394
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,235
I'm coming to get you.

395
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,731
Come on.

396
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,905
Come on!

397
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,545
Down.

398
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,779
This way!

399
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,652
We safe for now.

400
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,450
You look like hell, Rambo.

401
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,536
Tough night.

402
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,413
Maybe need this.

403
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:01,503
- You hurt bad.
- It's all right.

404
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,387
Listen...

405
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,556
what you did back there...

406
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,434
I won't forget it.

407
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,771
Thanks.

408
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:26,361
What you do now?
Try get across through Thailand?

409
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:29,281
- Yeah.
- Then go America?

410
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,699
Yeah.

411
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,582
You take me with you?

412
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,095
You take me?

413
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:54,514
Yeah.

414
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,145
I think you make good choice.

415
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,230
Yeah.

416
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,149
- We go?
- Let's go.

417
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,105
You're all right. You're all right.

418
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,614
- Rambo?
- Yeah. Yeah.

419
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,492
You...

420
01:05:55,576 --> 01:06:00,038
You not forget me?

421
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,456
No.

422
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,793
No. No.

423
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,019
- I want the rescue team ready to go.
- Your career,

424
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,438
reputation, your family's security...

425
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,650
- You think any one man's worth all that?
- Yes, I do.

426
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:33,405
- I'm giving you an order to withdraw.
- Do I get the team or go over your head?

427
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:37,117
You don't seem to understand something.
I'm in charge here.

428
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,828
You're just a tool.

429
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,330
We're the machine.

430
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:46,126
I want him placed under arrest.
He's not to leave the base.

431
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:54,426
- He never had a chance, did he?
- Like you said, Colonel, he went home.

432
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:02,773
Hey, up here!

433
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,486
Hurry!

434
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,615
Get back!

435
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:14,827
- Get out.
- Go on! Get moving!

436
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:19,456
Come on, get on the chopper.
Move it, move it. Move it! Keep going.

437
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,710
Get on the chopper.
Get 'em on the chopper.

438
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:27,047
Come on!
In the chopper. That's it.

439
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,341
Come on, move it, move it, move!

440
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:32,803
Come on, let's go.
Keep going! Keep going!

441
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,395
Come on! Move it, move it!

442
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:43,814
Hurry up! Get on.

443
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,399
Come on, go, go, go!

444
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:57,036
Man the gun.

445
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:12,843
Yeah. Yeah.

446
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,137
All right, we made it!

447
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,051
Chopper on our tail!

448
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,179
Hang on!

449
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,062
Hold on!

450
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:35,944
Fire in the tail!

451
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:46,325
Lone Wolf calling Wolf Den. Over.

452
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:51,455
Wolf Den, this is Lone Wolf.
Do you read?

453
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:55,876
- Wolf Den, this is Lone Wolf. Over.
- Yes, we hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.

454
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,378
Prepare for emergency landing.

455
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,756
Arriving with American POWs.

456
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:16,980
You heard.
Prepare for arriving POWs! Let's move it!

457
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:18,000
Get in there!

458
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,296
Let's go! Let's go, let's go!

459
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,551
All right, come on.
Easy, easy now. Easy.

460
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,763
All right, easy now.

461
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:35,309
Glad you made it!

462
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:43,567
Come on, you're doing good.
OK, easy with that now.

463
01:29:47,423 --> 01:29:50,050
Rambo, I don't make the orders.

464
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:52,719
I take 'em, just like you.

465
01:29:56,641 --> 01:30:00,811
I swear to God, I didn't know
it was supposed to happen like this.

466
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:04,147
It was just supposed to be
another assignment.

467
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,406
Mission...

468
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,700
...accomplished.

469
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:25,877
You know there's more men out there.

470
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:27,963
You know where they are.

471
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:33,885
Find 'em, or I'll find you.

472
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,980
Right over there.

473
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,237
Easy. Easy.

474
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:58,618
John.

475
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,954
Where you going?

476
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:03,248
I don't know.

477
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:07,711
You'll get a second Medal of Honor for this.

478
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:17,846
You should give it to them.

479
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:20,098
They deserve it more.

480
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:25,103
You can't keep running, John.
You're free now.

481
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,189
Come back with us.

482
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:30,567
Back to what?

483
01:31:31,402 --> 01:31:33,528
My friends died here.

484
01:31:35,072 --> 01:31:37,240
Part of me died here.

485
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:40,702
Everything that happened here
may be wrong,

486
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:44,873
but damn it,
don't hate your country for it.

487
01:31:44,957 --> 01:31:46,166
Hey.

488
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:49,085
I'd die for it.

489
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,881
Then what is it you want?

490
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,930
I want...

491
01:32:01,807 --> 01:32:04,309
...what they want

492
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:09,814
and every other guy who came over here
and spilt his guts

493
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:13,109
and gave everything he had wants.

494
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:17,113
For our country to love us

495
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:20,158
as much as we love it.

496
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,954
That's what I want.

497
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,462
How will you live, John?

498
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,548
Day by day.

499
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:55,527
â™ª we gave our hearts

500
01:32:55,611 --> 01:32:58,196
â™ª we gave it all

501
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:01,074
â™ª Flame in the fire

502
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:03,410
â™ª Burns forevermore

503
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:06,663
â™ª The sorrow in believin'

504
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:09,291
â™ª Honor and truth

505
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:12,085
â™ª Gray spires climbing

506
01:33:12,169 --> 01:33:16,256
â™ª wrapped around our youth

507
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,758
â™ª Peace in our life

508
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:20,802
â™ª Remember the call

509
01:33:20,886 --> 01:33:24,598
â™ª Oh, a cheer for my brothers

510
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:27,350
â™ª Think of them all

511
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:30,061
â™ª Home of the brave

512
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:32,606
â™ª We'll never fall

513
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:35,400
â™ª The strength of our nation

514
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:39,362
â™ª Belongs to us all

515
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,118
â™ª Time is the healing

516
01:33:45,202 --> 01:33:48,121
â™ª Of souls laid to rest

517
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:50,874
â™ª Peace is the virtue

518
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,460
â™ª Never forget

519
01:33:53,544 --> 01:33:56,379
â™ª Tomorrow's an angel

520
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:59,132
â™ª Watching us all

521
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:01,593
â™ª Tellin' the people

522
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:06,139
â™ª She wraps around our hearts

523
