YOU'RE RUINING THE SHOW.

THANK YOU...

9
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,433
FOR CLAPPING
FOR WHAT MY PARENTS

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,367
ARE ASHAMED OF.

11
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:12,067
OH, SAN FRANCISCO.

12
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:15,633
YES.
[cheers and applause]

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,467
OH...

14
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,600
MY THIRD FAVORITE CITY
TO DO COMEDY IN.

15
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,433
HUH?
THAT'S NOT BAD, RIGHT?

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,067
TOP TEN.

CONGRATULATIONS.

00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:29,667
AW, MORE BUTTFUCKING
PER SQUARE FOOT

19
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,800
THAN IN ANY PLACE
IN THE WORLD.

20
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,867
THAT'S YOU GUYS.
THAT'S YOU.

00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:36,967
[cheers and applause]

22
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:40,133
PUT THAT ON YOUR POSTCARDS.

"SAN FRANCISCO:

26
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:51,233
ALL RIGHT.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,667
NOW, IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME
PERFORM BEFORE,

28
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,933
I AM NOT GOOD LIVE.

29

HEADS UP.

30
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,433
IF I OFFEND ANYBODY TONIGHT,
I APOLOGIZE.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,700
THAT'S NOT MY INTENTION.

32
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:03,567
I'M NOT GONNA GUESS WHAT YOUR
PERSONAL LINE OF DECENCY IS.

33
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,400
I CROSS MY OWN
FROM TIME TO TIME.

34
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:08,600
IT'S HOW I KNOW
I STILL HAVE ONE.

35
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,533
ALL RIGHT.

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,333
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

37
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,167
IN THIS COUNTRY
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT

38
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,600
THAT THEY DON'T SERVE
ON JURY DUTY.

39
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:18,200
THAT'S HORSE SHIT.

40
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,167
IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER
WAY AROUND.

41
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,400
THEY SHOULD SERVE EXCLUSIVELY
ON JURY DUTY.

42
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:24,833
YEAH.

43

[cheers and applause]

44
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:32,533
THEN IT FINALLY WOULD BE
A JURY OF ONE'S OWN PEERS.

[laughter and applause]

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,567
IT'S NOT A STEREOTYPE
IF IT'S ALWAYS TRUE.

48
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:46,500
YEAH, THEN IT BECOMES LAW.

49
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:50,100
THAT JOKE IS CALLED
"LATINOS ARE CRIMINALS."

50
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,900
THAT'S JUST THE TITLE.

51
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:55,800
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

52
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,333
SOMETIMES BEFORE
I WALK ON STAGE,

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,433
MY GIRLFRIEND MIGHT SAY,
"HAVE A GOOD SHOW.

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,467
BREAK A LEG."

55
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,233
THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID
TO ME A FEW WEEKS AGO

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,267
RIGHT BEFORE I WALKED
ON STAGE.

57
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:06,500
SHE GOES, "HEY, YOU EVER
WORRY ABOUT GETTING SHOT

58
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,467
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE?"

59
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:11,600
I'M LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?"

60
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:16,133
SHE FOUGHT IT WITH,
"YOU SHOULD MOVE AROUND MORE."

61
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,600
UH, YOU SHOULD GO BACK
TO READING YOUR VAMPIRE BOOKS.

62
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:21,067
[laughter and cheers]

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,967
I SHOULD MOVE AROUND MORE?

64
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,967
AS IF A SNIPER WOULD
GET FRUSTRATED.

65
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,067
LIKE...

66
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,133
"I CAN'T KEEP UP.
HE LIVES."

67
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,367
YOU EVER SCRATCH YOUR GIRL
FROM THE HANGNAIL

68
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:40,267
AND PRETEND THAT
YOU'RE WOLVERINE?

69
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,533
SHE'S LIKE, "KNOCK IT OFF,"
AND I'M LIKE,

70
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,967
"YOU MADE ME LIKE THIS."

71
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,433
THEN YOU RUN INTO THE WOODS,
YOU'RE NAKED,

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,500
YOU GOT TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.

73
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,567
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?
WHY ARE YOU WEARING DOG TAGS?

74
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,067
DID I SERVE?

75
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,067
[laughter]

76
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,100
LOT OF TIMES, PEOPLE COMPLAIN
THAT THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER

77
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:58,667
TAKES TOO LONG TO GET READY
TO GO OUT AT NIGHT.

78
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,067
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT COMPLAINT.

79
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:05,067
AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
I NEVER WANT TO GO ANYWHERE.

80
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,067
SO I COULD CARE LESS HOW LONG
IT TAKES HER TO GET READY.

81
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,900
THAT'S JUST LESS TIME
I HAVE TO SPEND

82
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,667
WITH HER HORRIBLE FRIENDS
PRETENDING

83
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,900
THAT I DON'T WANT
TO KILL MYSELF.

84
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,367
YEAH.
[cheers and applause]

85
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,233
SHE'LL TAKE AN HOUR AND A HALF
TO GET READY,

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,433
COME DOWN AND BE LIKE,
"OH, MY GOODNESS.

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,500
YOU ARE SO PATIENT."

88
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,467
AND I'LL BE LIKE, "FOR WHAT?
YOU LOOK DISGUSTING."

89
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,167
RIGHT? YEAH.

90
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,267
NOW SHE'S CRYING.
WHATEVER.

91
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,367
I BOUGHT MYSELF AN EXTRA
TWO HOURS TO WATCH THE GAME.

92
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,300
YEAH.
YEAH.

93
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:33,567
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S GONNA BREAK
UP WITH ME.

94
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,467
SHE'S TEN YEARS YOUNGER.

95
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:39,067
SHE'S ONE OPINION AWAY
FROM BEING REPLACED.

96
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,700
I CAN SAY THAT.
I HAVE A TELEVISION SHOW.

97
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,067
YEAH.

98
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,300
THE POWER IN OUR HOUSEHOLD

99
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:49,767
HAS SHIFTED DRAMATICALLY.

100
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,200
NOW IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME
ON TWITTER,

101
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:56,200
YOU KNOW
I HAD DIARRHEA TODAY.

102
00:04:56,367 --> 00:05:00,467
AM I USING THAT WEBSITE
PROPERLY?

103
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:05,133
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO SIT
ON THE TOILET IN REVERSE.

104
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,600
"WE'RE LISTENING."

105
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,900
IT'S NICE, RIGHT?
YOU CAN TURN AROUND.

106
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,700
YOU CAN LEAN ON THE TANK.

107
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:15,367
I'M GONNA BE HERE FOR A WHILE.

108
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,367
YEAH, THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
CLAPPING RIGHT NOW,

109
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,500
THEY'RE THE ONES LIKE,
"OKAY, ALL KIDDING ASIDE,

110
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,533
"HE IS A GENIUS.

111
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,833
"NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S THE SIMPLICITY.

112
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:24,700
"I'VE BEEN SITTING ON THAT
THING MY WHOLE LIFE.

113
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,400
"YOU'RE TELLING ME
I COULD TURN AROUND,

114
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,333
"HAVE A BOWL OF CEREAL,
YEAH?

115
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,433
"SET THE ALARM
TEN MINUTES LATER.

116
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,100
MULTITASK."

117
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,067
ALL RIGHT, NOBODY SHOULD EAT
WHILE ON THE TOILET.

118
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,233
"BUT I'M LACTOSE INTOLERANT
AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED

119
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,533
TO ENJOY A BOWL OF PUFFINS
WITH WHOLE MILK."

120
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,833
THAT'S MORE OF AN ALMOND MILK
CEREAL,

121
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,833
BUT LIVE YOUR DREAM.

122
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:51,967
SOMEBODY EMAILED ME
AND THEY'RE LIKE,

123
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,067
"HEY, DIPSHIT--"

124
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,900
WHICH, FOR THE RECORD,
IS A WONDERFUL SUBJECT LINE

125
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,867
IF YOU EVER WANT ME
TO READ YOUR EMAILS.

126
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,467
OH, LET'S SEE WHAT
THIS NICE FAN HAS TO SAY.

127
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:04,433
YOU HAD ME AT "HELLO."

128
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,467
THEY'RE LIKE, "YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
TO TAKE YOUR PANTS

129
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,233
COMPLETELY OFF TO SIT
ON THE TOILET BACKWARDS?"

130
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,300
[laughter]

131
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,067
TOUCHE.

132
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,100
ALL RIGHT,
SO I DON'T RESEARCH.

133
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,667
IT'S A PRE-SHOWER SHIT,
AGREED?

134
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:23,367
CAN WE MOVE ON,
STICKLERS TO EVERY JOKE DETAIL?

135
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,100
YOU EVER HAVE
A POST-SHOWER SHIT?

136
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,833
OH, MIGHT AS WELL
GO BACK TO BED

137
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,300
AND START
YOUR WHOLE DAY OVER.

138
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,267
THINGS ARE WRONG.

139
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,967
THAT'S NOT
THE ORDER OF EVENTS.

140
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,600
THERE'S A GLITCH
IN THE MATRIX.

141
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,400
THIS WORLD'S NOT REAL.
MOM!

142
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,067
WIPE ME!

143
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,167
[laughter and cheers]

144
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:46,067
I RECENTLY STARTED FLAT-IRONING
MY BALL HAIR.

145
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,133
COME ON, LADIES.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

146
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,067
IF YOU HAVE CURLY HAIR,
YOU JUST WANT STRAIGHT HAIR.

147
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,700
SO NOW WHEN PEOPLE
SEE MY BALLS,

148
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,467
IT'S LIKE,
"OH, MY GOODNESS.

149
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,667
"THAT LOOKS REALLY,
REALLY GOOD.

150
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,700
ISN'T THAT DAMAGING
TO THE HAIR?"

151
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:00,800
AND I'M LIKE, "YEAH,
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?"

152
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,267
I WISH VICTORIA BECKHAM
WOULD KNOCK IT OFF

153
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,433
WITH ALL THE CUTE DOS.

154
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,167
I CAN'T KEEP UP.

155
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,833
MY BALLS STILL
HAVE THE '06 POSH.

156
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:11,100
REMEMBER THAT LITTLE
TRENDY LITTLE CUT?

157
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:13,533
POSH SPICE?

158
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,300
LOOKS LIKE MY TESTICLES.

159
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:20,800
OKAY?

160
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:22,067
AM I THE ONLY PERSON
THAT HOPES DAVID BECKHAM

161
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,133
HAS SEX WITH BRAD PITT?

162
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,300
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE
OF CASTING IN HOLLYWOOD,

163
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:28,500
BUT MAKE IT HAPPEN BEFORE
ONE OF THEM'S

164
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:31,167
OUT OF THEIR PRIME.

165
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,833
CAN YOU IMAGINE THOSE TWO MEN
TOGETHER MAKING LOVE?

166
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:36,467
OH.

167
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:39,067
IF THERE'S A MAN
IN HERE THAT'S JUNK

168
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,333
DOESN'T WIGGLE JUST A LITTLE BIT
AT THE THOUGHT

169
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,900
OF THOSE TWO MEN TOGETHER--

170
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,667
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

171
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,600
YOUR HOMOPHOBIC
SEXUAL PREFERENCE.

172
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,733
AT THAT LEVEL, IT'S ART,
YOU MONKEY, OKAY?

173
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,367
YOU SHOULD BE HONORED THAT
YOU SHARE THE SAME RESTROOM

174
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:57,433
WITH THOSE GREEK GODS.

175
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,100
CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF THEY HAD A CHILD?

176
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:01,233
* AHH

177
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,833
WAS THAT SIMBA?

178
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:04,967
WHAT THE FUCK?

179
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:06,967
WAS THAT SIMBA?

180
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,167
THAT'S THE BECKHAM-PITT KID?

181
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:14,367
THAT'S "PITTKHAM"?

182
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:18,900
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHILD
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.

183
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:23,833
PICTURE BABY JESUS
WITH BETTER ABS.

184
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,800
THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING BABY.

185
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,867
IF THEY HAD A BABY
ABERCROMBIE STORE,

186
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,867
THEY'D HIRE HIM TO WORK
THE FRONT DOOR, RIGHT?

187
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,067
JUST STANDIN' THERE SHIRTLESS,
PROPPED UP.

188
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,067
HE CAN'T STAND YET.
JUST LEANING AGAINST THE WALL.

189
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,333
BIG POSTER,
BIG POSTER OF HIMSELF

190
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,267
JUST STANDING IN LITTLE
TIGHT PAMPERS.

191
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:40,733
AND YOU'D WALK IN
AND YOU'D BE LIKE,

192
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,467
"I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS,

193
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,067
BUT I WANT TO FUCK
THAT BABY."

194
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,667
OH, MAN!
DO I WANT TO FUCK THAT BABY!

195
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,067
IF I HAD THREE WISHES,

196
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
TWO OF 'EM WOULD BE
TO FUCK THAT BABY

197
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,500
AND ONE WOULD BE
FOR MORE WISHES.

198
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,433
"WELL, YOU CAN'T DO THAT."

199
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,267
THEN I WANT TO FUCK THE BABY
A THIRD TIME.

200
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,300
I WOULD LIKE TO USE
ALL THREE WISHES

201
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:05,967
BANGING THAT BABY.

202
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,567
GO AHEAD, DUMB PEOPLE,
BE OFFENDED BY A JOKE

203
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:11,500
THAT DOESN'T HAVE
A PLAUSIBLE PREMISE.

204
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:15,067
OH, I'D LOVE TO READ
YOUR EMAIL.

205
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,533
"I FELT YOU WENT OVER
THE LINE A BIT

206
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,633
"WHEN YOU THEORETICALLY
WANTED TO FORNICATE

207
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,467
WITH A MYTHICAL CHILD."

208
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:28,633
[laughter and applause]

209
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,467
HEADS UP, MORMONS,
THIS JOKE'S GONNA STING.

210
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:35,767
[laughter]

211
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,867
NEXT TIME A GOLDEN PLATE FALLS
FROM THE HEAVENS,

212
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,700
GO AHEAD AND PUT IT
IN YOUR SPAM FILE.

213
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,700
LET'S NOT BASE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
ON A RELIGION

214
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:44,367
THAT'S OLD ENOUGH
FOR MY DAD TO BE LIKE,

215
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,733
"OH, YEAH.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

216
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,967
"UH, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

217
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,367
"I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE
WEARING THEIR PAJAMAS

218
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,433
"UNDER THEIR CLOTHES.

219
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,400
I ASSUME THEIR GOD WANTS THEM
TO BE COMFY."

220
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:02,567
THE MORMON CHURCH SPENT
$20 MILLION

221
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,867
LAST YEAR IN THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA

222
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:07,300
MAKING SURE QUEERS DIDN'T
LEGALLY GET MARRIED.

223
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,333
SUCCESSFULLY, I MIGHT ADD.

224
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,233
SO I GUESS WE'RE NOT AS LIBERAL
AS WE ALL THOUGHT.

225
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,500
AND THIS IS WHAT I SAY TO
THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PERSON

226
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:19,267
THAT'S SO TERRIFIED
OF GAY MARRIAGE BECOMING LEGAL.

227
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,267
JUST BECAUSE THE STATE
SAYS IT'S LEGAL,

228
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:25,500
IT'S NOT LIKE GOD'S GONNA
LET 'EM INTO HEAVEN.

229
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,400
OKAY?

230
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:30,067
SO YOU CAN STILL SLEEP SOUND
EVERY NIGHT

231
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,067
KNOWING THAT
GOAL LINE DEFENSE

232
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,433
IS UP AT THE PEARLY GATES
JUST GOING,

233
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,633
"YEAH.
[cheers and applause]

234
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,967
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
IN HERE, FAGGOTS!"

235
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,400
[grunts]

236
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:44,267
[laughter and applause]

237
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:50,800
SO I WAS WALKING INTO
WHOLE FOODS RECENTLY.

238
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,567
I DON'T GROCERY SHOP THERE,
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

239
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,500
BUT I LOVE THE SMELL
OF LAVENDER,

240
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,633
SO IT'S WHERE
I GET MY LAUNDRY DETERGENT.

241
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,600
NORMALLY, WHEN YOU WALK INTO
A WHOLE FOODS,

242
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,767
THERE'S SOMEBODY OUTSIDE
WITH A CLIPBOARD LIKE,

243
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:01,833
"HEY, YOU WANT TO HELP PANDAS
KEEP GETTING BONERS?"

244
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:03,067
YEAH, OKAY.

245
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,233
ON THIS DAY, IT WAS LIKE,
"HEY, YOU WANT TO HELP

246
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,433
OVERTURN PROP EIGHT?"

247
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,800
AND I'M LIKE, "EH."

248
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:12,933
I JUST WANTED TO SHOP.
I DIDN'T--

249
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,833
EH.

250
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,867
BUT I NOTICED THERE WAS
A REALLY OLD LADY

251
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,067
WALKING IN BEHIND ME,
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

252
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,767
SHE WAS ASKED AS WELL.

253
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:21,500
LIKE,
THAT I WASN'T PROFILED.

254
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,600
"THIS GUY'S QUEER.
HE'LL HELP."

255
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,667
AND SURE ENOUGH,
SHE ASKED,

256
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,867
"MA'AM, DO YOU WANT TO HELP
OVERTURN PROP EIGHT?"

257
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,600
AND SHE'S LIKE, "OHH."

258
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,367
I'M LIKE,
"EXPLAIN IT TO HER."

259
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,700
"IT'S TO MAKE GAY MARRIAGE
LEGAL

260
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:32,867
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA."

261
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,633
SHE'S LIKE, "OH."

262
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,700
AND I COULD JUST SEE
80 OR 90 YEARS

263
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,400
OF SEXIST, RACIST SHIT
THAT SHE'S HAD TO PUT UP WITH

264
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,200
GO ROUND AND ROUND.

265
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,967
I'M PRAYING SHE FALLS
OVER DEAD.

266
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,567
LIKE, "OH, CARPET MUNCHERS!
NO!"

267
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,700
[laughter]

268
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:48,367
NONE OF WHICH HAPPENED.

269
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,600
SHE SIGNED IT.
I'M AN ASSHOLE.

270
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,733
DO YOU REMEMBER THE COMMERCIALS
THEY RAN?

271
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,667
IT WAS A LITTLE GIRL THAT CAME
RUNNING HOME FROM SCHOOL,

272
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,667
UH, AND, UH,
SHE'D BE LIKE, "MOMMY,

273
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,433
"MOMMY, MOMMY, THE TEACHER SAID
WHEN I GET OLDER

274
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,367
I CAN MARRY A PRINCESS
IF I WANT TO."

275
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,667
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

276
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,600
WHEN YOUR KID SAYS THAT?"

277
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,433
[laughter]

278
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,400
AND EVERY PARENT IN CALIFORNIA
IS LIKE,

279
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:09,900
"WHOA, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TALK TO OUR KIDS?

280
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:11,433
SORRY, QUEERS.
NOPE."

281
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
YEAH.

282
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,467
THAT'S ESPERANZA'S JOB.

283
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,333
[cheers and applause]

284
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,333
SO I WANNA HIRE
THE SAME LITTLE GIRL

285
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,833
TO DO COMMERCIALS FOR ME
IN THE STATE OF UTAH,

286
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,067
AND I WANT HER TO COME
RUNNING HOME AND BE LIKE,

287
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,967
"MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY,

288
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,567
HOW COME YOU'RE NINE YEARS OLDER
THAN ME?"

289
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,600
YEAH.

290
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,833
BECAUSE WE LEARNED MATH,
AND THIS DOESN'T ADD UP.

291
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,267
"MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY,
MOMMY--"

292
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:37,467
SHE'S CALLING OUT TO
ALL OF HER MOTHERS.

293
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,533
AND THEY START COMING OUT OF
THE CABINETS

294
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,567
IN THEIR LITTLE HOUSE ON
 THE PRAIRIE OUTFITS

295
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,067
TRYING TO EXPLAIN
HOW OPEN-MINDED THEY REALLY ARE.

296
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,500
COMPARED TO WHO,
THE AMISH?

297
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,367
AM I THE ONLY PERSON
THAT BLAMES GLOBAL WARMING

298
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,800
ENTIRELY ON THE AMISH?

299
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:56,067
[laughter]

300
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,200
ARE THEY NOT
A CONSTANT REMINDER

301
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,200
OF HOW AWFUL LIFE WOULD BE

302
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,533
WITHOUT ALL THIS
GREAT TECHNOLOGY?

303
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,533
EVERY TIME I WANNA CUT BACK
AND CONSERVE

304
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,567
ON NATURAL RESOURCES,
I JUST LOOK AT THE AMISH

305
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:09,167
AND I'M LIKE, "HO, HO,
FUCK THAT.

306
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,800
FILL IT UP. FILL IT UP."

307
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13,667
NO, NO.

308
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,500
I'M NOT GONNA RIDE AROUND
IN A BUGGY.

309
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,567
IT'S BAD ENOUGH I HAVE
A FOUR-CYLINDER.

310
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:22,133
BUT I WOULD LIKE
A FIRELESS FIREPLACE.

311
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,100
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT,
AMISH.

312
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,367
APPARENTLY, YOU PARTNERED UP
WITH THE WICCANS

313
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,933
BECAUSE THAT IS MAGICAL.

314
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,267
[laughter]

315
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,433
YOU KNOW THE ECONOMY'S
IN THE TOILET

316
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,333
WHEN THE AMISH CAN AFFORD
FULL-PAGE ADS IN EVERY PAPER.

317
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,533
APPARENTLY,
BUTTER IS RECESSION-PROOF.

318
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,833
DOES ANYONE IN HERE KNOW WHAT
I'M EVEN TALKING ABOUT

319
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:43,633
AT THIS POINT?

320
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,367
THE AMISH,
THEY MAKE THIS FIREPLACE

321
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,300
THAT DOESN'T PLUG IN.

322
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,100
THERE'S NO FIRE,
BUT IT'S PUMPING OUT HEAT.

323
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,367
I ASSUME THERE'S
A HAMSTER IN THERE

324
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:54,433
LOSING HIS MIND.

325
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
IT'S NO SNUGGIE,
BUT IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.

326
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,833
YEAH, SOMEBODY BOUGHT ME
A SNUGGIE AS A JOKE GIFT.

327
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:01,067
HA, THE JOKE'S ON YOU.
I ENJOY IT.

328
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,533
[laughter]

329
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,100
YEAH. HUH.

330
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:06,067
I TOSS AND TURN AT NIGHT.

331
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,300
FINALLY, A BLANKET
THAT'S LIKE, "NUH-UH,

332
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,467
I'M GONNA KEEP YOU WARM."

333
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,567
[laughter]

334
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,433
IT'S LIKE HAVING
A SMALL CHILD WITH POLIO

335
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,933
KEEP YOU IN A FULL NELSON.

336
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,633
THE PERFECT PRESSURE.

337
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,367
WHAT UPSET ME ABOUT THE GIFT

338
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:24,100
IS THAT'S ALL I RECEIVED,
WAS ONE SAGE GREEN SNUGGIE.

339
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:25,333
WHEN IN FACT, I KNOW IT
COMES WITH TWO SNUGGIES

340
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,567
AND TWO BOOK LIGHTS.

341
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,433
THOSE ARE $20 VALUES.

342
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,667
WHERE THE HELL IS
THE REST OF MY GIFT?

343
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,200
YEAH.

344
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:36,067
YOU HAVE UNTIL CHRISTMAS
OR I'M COMING TO YOUR HOUSE

345
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,967
AND RIPPING 3/4 OF
YOUR FATHEAD OFF YOUR WALL.

346
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:41,267
NOT BIG BEN. YEAH.

347
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:44,067
BEN SHOULDN'T BE
IN THE BATHROOM WITH ANYONE.

348
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:47,167
[laughter and applause]

349
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,133
BEN ROETHLISBERGER
IS TIM TEBOW MINUS JESUS.

350
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,467
[laughter]

351
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,167
[chuckles]

352
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,067
SPEAKING OF QUARTERBACKS,
UH, BRETT FAVRE--

353
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,267
I LOVE THAT EVERYBODY GAVE HIM
SO MUCH GRIEF TO RETIRE.

354
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,233
ARE YOU KIDDING?

355
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,967
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU WANT ME TO FIX THE ECONOMY?

356
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,267
BECAUSE I CAN.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

357
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:10,200
HERE'S WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

358
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,067
YOU GOTTA BE PREPARED
TO WORK REALLY HARD

359
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,067
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
AND EVENTUALLY DIE.

360
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,200
[laughter]

361
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:19,067
AND IT'S THE LADDER THAT'S
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.

362
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:22,400
NO ONE DIES.
PEOPLE LIVE FOREVER.

363
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:23,833
PEOPLE GET TO RETIRE
AT 65.

364
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,500
THAT WAS AN AGE THAT WAS SET

365
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,500
WHEN PEOPLE DIE AT 66,
66 1/2.

366
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,300
PEOPLE LIVE FOREVER NOW

367
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:32,367
AND OUR ECONOMY
CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

368
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,567
'CAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW OLD MY GRANDPARENTS ARE,

369
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,567
BUT I KNOW THAT
THEY SHOULD BE DEAD.

370
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,633
AND TRUST ME, THEY DON'T WANNA
BE ALIVE EITHER.

371
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,533
THERE'S NOT A WELCOME MAT

372
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,600
AT THEIR FRONT UNIT
IN NAPLES, FLORIDA.

373
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:46,600
THERE'S A "DO NOT RESUSCITATE"
NAILED TO THEIR DOOR.

374
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,500
I'M NOT MAKING THAT UP.
YEAH.

375
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,433
IF YOU KNOCK ON
MY GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE

376
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,367
AND YOU SEE ONE OF THEM
LYING ON THE FLOOR,

377
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,067
THE ONLY THING LEGALLY
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO

378
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:57,467
IS A FINISHING MOVE.

379
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,867
HADOUKEN.

380
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,700
THAT WOULD BE MINE.

381
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:05,133
BRETT FAVRE SHOULD RETIRE.

382
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,067
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

383
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:11,333
HE MAKES $12 MILLION A YEAR
TO PLAY A GAME.

384
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,300
"YEAH,
I'M GONNA KEEP PLAYING."

385
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,400
"HEY, BRETT, THE WHOLE WORLD
THINKS YOU SHOULD RETIRE."

386
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,233
"YOU SAID $12 MILLION,
RIGHT?

387
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,067
YEAH, THEY CAN GO
FUCK THEMSELVES."

388
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,100
[laughter and applause]

389
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:25,400
I WOULD NEVER QUIT,
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

390
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,233
WHAT ABOUT IN FOUR YEARS?

391
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,067
HE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO BE A STARTER,

392
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,133
BUT HE COULD BE A BACKUP
IN THE NFL.

393
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,867
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PAYS?
ABOUT $4 TO $5 MILLION.

394
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:34,067
"UH, YEP,
I'M GONNA DO THAT."

395
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:35,833
HOW ABOUT TEN YEARS?

396
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,633
NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE
A BACKUP.

397
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,567
BUT HE COULD BE
ON THE PRACTICE SQUAD.

398
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,400
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PAYS?
ABOUT $850,000.

399
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,600
"UH, YEP, I'M GONNA DO THAT
AS WELL.

400
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,333
I'LL PLAY FOREVER."

401
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,167
IT'D MAKE THE GAME
MORE ENJOYABLE

402
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,933
IF PEOPLE WEREN'T ALLOWED
TO RETIRE.

403
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,700
ATHLETES DON'T WANNA QUIT
EITHER.

404
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:50,800
SEE SOME 70-YEAR-OLD
RETURN A PUNT,

405
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:52,100
LIKE, "OH..."

406
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:53,933
HE GETS HIT, HE EXPLODES,

407
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,233
HE DIES ON THE FIELD
WITH SOME HONOR.

408
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,600
YEAH.

409
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:03,533
AND SPORTS NEEDS STEROIDS.

410
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,800
IT DOES.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

411
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,733
OH, BASEBALL, CERTAINLY.

412
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,133
BASEBALL'S A STRIKE AWAY
FROM BEING SOCCER.

413
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,167
YEAH.

414
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,100
AND IF YOU LIKE SOCCER,
WELL, WELCOME TO AMERICA.

415
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,100
SEE, OUR COUNTRY
ALREADY HAS ENTERTAINMENT

416
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,267
SO WATCHING PEOPLE
CHASE A BALL FOR FOUR HOURS

417
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,567
TO END ZERO-ZERO
IS NOT ENJOYABLE

418
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,167
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THE BLEACHERS COLLAPSE

419
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,633
AND HALF OF EUROPE DIES.

420
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
[cheers and applause]

421
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,233
OR YOU'RE WATCHING THAT GIRL

422
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,967
FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF NEW MEXICO.

423
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,600
SHE SEEMS
PRETTY COMPETITIVE.

424
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,500
YOU REMEMBER HER?

425
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,300
SHE WAS YANKING PEOPLE DOWN
BY THE HAIR,

426
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,233
KICKING CHICKS IN THE PUSSY,
UH...

427
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,867
I CAN ONLY ASSUME
HER FATHER

428
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,767
HAD A BUNCH OF GAMBLING DEBT

429
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,833
AND EVERYTHING WAS RIDING
ON THAT GAME.

430
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:46,433
AND SHE'S OUT THERE,
"I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, PA."

431
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,333
OR SHE REALLY HATES MORMONS.
ONE OR THE OTHER.

432
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,633
PRETTY SURE
THEY WERE PLAYING BYU.

433
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,800
OH...
[scoffs]

434
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,833
BASEBALL.

435
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:01,167
NOBODY WANTS TO WATCH
A PITCHING BATTLE EITHER.

436
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,067
LET'S HIT THE BALL DEEP.

437
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,967
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
YOUR RECORDS EITHER.

438
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,833
FOR EVERY SUPERSTAR
THAT HAS DONE STEROIDS,

439
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,667
A BILLION DOUBLE "A" BOYS
HAVE JUICED UP

440
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,700
SO THE PLAYING FIELD
IS PLENTY EVEN.

441
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,400
WE'LL PUT AN ASTERISK
NEXT TO BARRY BONDS' NAME.

442
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,433
SURE.

443
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,400
AS SOON AS WE PUT ONE
NEXT TO BABE RUTH'S NAME.

444
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:17,633
GETTING TO BREAK RECORDS
BEFORE BLACK PEOPLE

445
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,200
WERE ALLOWED TO PLAY?

446
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,533
EXCUSE ME?

447
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,733
WHERE IS THAT ASTERISK?

448
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,767
WHY DON'T PEOPLE
TALK ABOUT THAT?

449
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,900
[cheers and applause]

450
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,633
OH.

451
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,067
I'D LOVE TO KNOW
HOW MANY HOMERS

452
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:33,133
THE BABE WOULD HAVE HIT

453
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,767
HAD C.C. BEEN THROWING HIM
92-MILE-AN-HOUR SLIDERS.

454
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,800
YEAH.

455
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,833
MAYBE THE FAT BOY
WOULD HAVE PUT THE CIGAR DOWN

456
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,633
AND QUIT POINTING
HAD JOSE BEEN ALLOWED TO SWIM

457
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,067
90 MILES TO THROW HIM
A JUNK BALL.

458
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,067
DON'T WORRY
IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW.

459
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,133
90 MILES IS THE DISTANCE
FROM KEY WEST TO CUBA,

460
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,867
JOSE'S A STEREOTYPICAL NAME
FOR A LATINO BALL PLAYER,

461
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,967
AND A JUNK BALL'S
AN IMPOSSIBLE PITCH

462
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,933
TO HIT YARD ANYPLACE EXCEPT FOR
THE NEW YANKEE STADIUM,

463
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,833
WHICH IS A JOKE.

464
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:00,300
THE POINT...

465
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,800
IS THE RECORD BOOKS
MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT

466
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,433
HAD OUR COUNTRY
NOT BEEN FOUNDED BY RACISTS.

467
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,133
THAT'S ALL.

468
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,333
AND I LOVE THAT IN 2010,

469
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,333
YOU'RE STILL NOT ALLOWED
TO SHIT ON THE FOUNDING FATHERS.

470
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,733
WHY NOT?
SCREW THEM.

471
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,267
THEY WERE A BUNCH OF RACIST
FUCKING PIGS

472
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,067
WITH A HANDFUL OF GOOD IDEAS.

473
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,867
I JUST HOPE WHEN THEY WERE

474
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,600
SIGNING THE DECLARATION
OF INDEPENDENCE,

475
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:20,933
THEY SHOT EACH OTHER
A GLANCE.

476
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,167
"ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.

477
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,967
"YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN.

478
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:27,533
[laughs sarcastically]

479
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,500
NOW GET ME SOME HOT COFFEE,
BOY."

480
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:33,267
[laughter]

481
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,133
OH...

482
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,900
AT LEAST WE'RE NOT WOMEN.
RIGHT, FELLAS?

483
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:39,200
OH, JEEZ.

484
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:41,067
WHAT IS THAT LIKE?
IS IT HORRIBLE?

485
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:44,800
IS IT AWFUL...
TO KNOW YOU'RE NUMBER TWO?

486
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,733
BY THE WAY,
THESE AREN'T MY BELIEFS.

487
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,133
IT'S MY OBSERVATIONS
ON THE WORLD I LIVE IN.

488
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,067
IF IT CHANGES,

489
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,167
I'LL ADJUST
THE MATERIAL ACCORDINGLY.

490
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,067
COOL.

491
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,800
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU TRY TO
RATIONALIZE IT.

492
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,733
"NO,
IT'S GREAT BEING A WOMAN.

493
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,933
FREE DRINKS IS WORTH
NOT HAVING EQUALITY."

494
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,733
[laughter]

495
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
LISTEN,
YOU'RE IN A GREAT COUNTRY

496
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:06,900
TO BE NUMBER TWO.

497
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:08,600
BECAUSE AT LEAST IN AMERICA,
IT'S CLOSE, RIGHT?

498
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:10,267
MEN ARE HERE,
WOMEN ARE HERE.

499
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:11,633
SOME COUNTRIES,
IT'S LIKE THIS

500
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
AND HOUSE CAT IS RIGHT THERE.

501
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,700
HO-HO.

502
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:16,733
THAT IS A BAD COUNTRY
TO BE A WOMAN IN.

503
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,567
DON'T GET LOST
IN A HIKE THERE.

504
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,400
YOU'LL END UP ON YOUTUBE
WITHOUT A HEAD

505
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,567
AND THERE'S NO
WEB REDEMPTION FOR THAT.

506
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,833
[cheers and applause]

507
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,933
I DO THINK WE CAN BE
A LITTLE LESS PC

508
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,767
WHEN IT COMES TO SPORTS,
THOUGH.

509
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,433
JUST ONCE I WANNA HEAR
AN ANNOUNCER GO,

510
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,167
"GOD,
BLACK PEOPLE ARE FAST.

511
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:43,067
"HOLY COW, ALL OF THEM,
THEY'RE FAST.

512
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:46,233
BACK TO YOU, BOB."

513
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,533
WHY DON'T WE SAY THAT?
WE'RE ALL THE SAME SPECIES.

514
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,767
GOT IT.

515
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,800
IF I'M ON A HORSE TRACK

516
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,667
AND I SEE 'EM CRAMMING
A CLYDESDALE IN GATE THREE,

517
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,567
UH, I'M NOT GONNA
PUT MY MONEY ON IT.

518
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,400
GONNA BET ON
THE THOROUGHBRED.

519
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,800
PREFERABLY
ONE FROM JAMAICA.

520
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:03,067
THEY'VE GOT WHEELS.

521
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:05,300
I DON'T LIKE STUART SCOTT
ON SPORTSCENTER.

522
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,300
UH, IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO HE IS,

523
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,633
HE'S A BLACK GENTLEMAN
THAT GRADUATED FROM U.N.C.

524
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,433
WITH ALMOST PERFECT GRADES,

525
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,167
UH, YET FEELS THE NEED
TO TALK HIP-HOP

526
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,067
FOR ABSOLUTELY
NO REASON AT ALL.

527
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,067
WHILE HE'S CALLING PLAYS,
HE'LL BE LIKE,

528
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,800
"BOO-YAH."

529
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:20,533
EASY, STUART.

530
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,300
FIRST OF ALL,

531
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,267
I HAVE MORE STREET CRED
THAN YOU.

532
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:25,867
SECOND OF ALL,
I HAVE HD TELEVISION

533
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,867
AND YOU HAVE ONE EYE.

534
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:31,133
YEAH.

535
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,100
IT'S GROSSING ME OUT.

536
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:36,200
IT'S 8:00 IN THE MORNING,
I'M EATING EGGOS.

537
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:37,900
I DON'T WANNA SEE CYCLOPS

538
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:41,733
STRUGGLING WITH
A TELEPROMPTER.

539
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,067
"BOO-YAH."

540
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,933
TAKE THAT TO THE UK

541
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,800
WHERE THEY EMBRACE UGLY PEOPLE
ON TELEVISION,

542
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:49,233
NOT HERE IN AMERICA,
YOU CIRCUS FREAK.

543
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,300
YEAH.

544
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:52,400
NEXT TIME YOU WANNA
CATCH PASSES ON THE SIDELINE,

545
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,133
USE YOUR HANDS.

546
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,500
DON'T LET IT COME TO
THE BODY.

547
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,533
YOU LEARN THAT IN POP WARNER.

548
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,200
I'M AWARE THAT I COULD
END THE JOKE AT THE GOOD PART.

549
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:06,333
I CHOOSE NOT TO.

550
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
GAVE A COMMENCEMENT SPEECH
RECENTLY AT A HIGH SCHOOL,

551
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:11,067
AND THAT DIDN'T GO WELL
AT ALL.

552
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,767
A BUNCH OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS,

553
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:14,600
PARENTS
THAT ARE PROUD OF THEM,

554
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,633
AND I'M BELITTLING
THE ENTIRE THING.

555
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,767
AND THE ADMINISTRATION
GOT REALLY UPSET WITH ME.

556
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:20,633
THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, UH,
WE DIDN'T KNOW

557
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,333
YOU WEREN'T GONNA
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY."

558
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,233
TO WHICH I REPLIED,
"REALLY?

559
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
"YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS WHERE
I WAS GONNA GET SERIOUS?

560
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,300
HIGH SCHOOL,
HOW DID YOU DO IT?"

561
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,233
[laughter]

562
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,067
NO.

563
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:37,067
I REFUSE TO GIVE
THAT GENERIC SPEECH.

564
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,833
"AS I LOOK OUT HERE,

565
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,633
I SEE FUTURE LAWYERS
AND DOCTORS."

566
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,067
I GAVE THE REAL SPEECH.
"THERE'S FELONS HERE.

567
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:46,067
[laughter]

568
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:49,867
SOME OF YOU WILL DIE IN
A D.U.I. ACCIDENT TONIGHT."

569
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,733
OH, I'M SORRY.

570
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,733
EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY A DOSE OF REALITY

571
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,733
BEFORE COMMUNITY COLLEGE
IS A BAD THING.

572
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,067
BECAUSE I CERTAINLY DON'T
NEED TO PANDER TO THE 1%.

573
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:00,467
THEY DON'T NEED
MY LITTLE PEP RALLY.

574
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,467
THEY'RE GONNA BE JUST FINE.

575
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,600
NOBODY'S BEEN A PILE OF SHIT
THEIR ENTIRE LIFE

576
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,433
AND THEN TURNED IT AROUND

577
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,067
BECAUSE OF
THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS.

578
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,933
EXCUSE ME?

579
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,567
NO, NO, IT JUST CLICKED.

580
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:17,067
"SO YOU'RE SAYING
I CAN BE ANYTHING?

581
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,233
"OH, YEAH,
THAT SOUNDS WAY BETTER THAN

582
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,533
"WHAT I WAS GONNA DO.

583
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,067
I LIKE THIS GUY."

584
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,267
DON'T YOU LOVE IT
WHEN PEOPLE IN SCHOOL ARE LIKE,

585
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:25,667
"I'M A BAD TEST TAKER."

586
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,333
YOU MEAN, YOU'RE STUPID.

587
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,667
[laughter]

588
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,400
OH, YOU STRUGGLE WITH
THAT PART

589
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:34,533
WHERE WE FIND OUT
WHAT YOU KNOW?

590
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,233
OH.

591
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,067
NO, NO,
I CAN TOTALLY RELATE.

592
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,800
SEE, BECAUSE
I'M A BRILLIANT PAINTER

593
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:42,367
MINUS MY GOD-AWFUL
BRUSHSTROKES.

594
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:45,333
OH, HOW THE MASTERPIECE
IS CRYSTAL UP HERE,

595
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,800
BUT ONCE PAINT HITS CANVAS,
I DEVELOP PARKINSON'S.

596
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:50,467
[laughter]

597
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,167
I APOLOGIZE IF THERE'S
A PARKINSON'S PAINTER HERE

598
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,100
THIS EVENING.

599
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,467
I ASSUME YOUR BEST WORK
IS IN THE A.M.

600
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:59,333
PROBABLY GETS A BIT ABSTRACT
BY NOON.

601
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,233
[laughter]

602
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,767
HANG IN THERE,
IT GETS WORSE.

603
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:09,533
[laughter and applause]

604
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,400
YOU EVER HEAR
THIS EXPRESSION?

605
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:12,600
"THE WORST DAY OF FISHING
IS BETTER THAN

606
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:13,767
THE BEST DAY AT WORK."

607
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:15,467
UH, I'LL CALL B.S.

608
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:17,467
[laughter]

609
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,167
I'VE WATCHED THE DEADLIEST CATCH
ON DISCOVERY.

610
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,900
I'VE NEVER ONCE BEEN
AT WORK,

611
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:22,567
CAPSIZED INTO
40-DEGREE WATER,

612
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:23,733
WATCHED
ALL MY COWORKERS DIE

613
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,467
AND BE LIKE, "HEY,

614
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,900
AT LEAST WE'RE FUCKIN'
FISHIN'."

615
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,600
HUH?

616
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:30,733
AM I RIGHT, CRIMINALS?

617
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,567
I MEAN, CREW?

618
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,433
YEAH.

619
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,967
YOUR VALEDICTORIAN'S
NOT ON THAT SHIP.

620
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:38,800
UNLESS, OF COURSE,

621
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:40,467
HE JUST MURDERED HIS WIFE
IN CANCUN.

622
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,067
UH, THEN MAYBE,
THEN MAYBE.

623
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:45,433
I DON'T KNOW.

624
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,533
DID CHRIS BROWN BEAT RIHANNA?

625
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,967
OR DID RIHANNA GET TOO CLOSE
WHILE CHRIS WAS DANCING?

626
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:51,733
[laughter]

627
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,467
I DON'T KNOW.
I WASN'T THERE.

628
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:57,333
WHAT I DO KNOW FROM WATCHING
CHRIS' MUSIC VIDEOS

629
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,733
OVER AND OVER IS THIS GUY
LOVES TO JUMP UP

630
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,133
AND DO A ROUNDHOUSE KICK
FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT ALL.

631
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,233
MAYBE HE WAS JUST STOMPING
THE YARD

632
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,800
AND ACCIDENTALLY CAUGHT
SOME OF THAT

633
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:12,733
HORRIBLE HAIRDO.

634
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,800
"THERE'S NO EXCUSE
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE."

635
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,500
IT SOUNDS LIKE A CHALLENGE.

636
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:22,100
[laughs]

637
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:25,133
I MEAN, DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE SO BLACK AND WHITE

638
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,867
IN THIS KINDERGARTEN COUNTRY
OF OURS?

639
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,233
"THERE'S NO EXCUSE."

640
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,200
WHAT IF YOU COME HOME
FROM A LONG DAY AT WORK

641
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:33,267
AND YOUR WIFE HAS DROWNED
TWO OF YOUR KIDS?

642
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:35,067
SHE'S ABOUT TO DUNK
THE THIRD ONE.

643
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,700
CAN YOU RUN OVER
AND POP HER THEN?

644
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:41,767
"UNFORTUNATELY, NO.
THERE'S NO EXCUSE.

645
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:44,400
GONNA HAVE TO LET HER
DROWN THAT THIRD ONE."

646
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:46,567
WHAT IF YOU ASK HER
TO DVR THE GAME

647
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:48,567
BUT SHE FORGETS TO RECORD
THE HALF-HOUR SHOW AFTERWARDS

648
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:50,767
JUST IN CASE
IT GOES INTO OVERTIME?

649
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:54,100
THE POINT IS
THERE'S A GRAY AREA.

650
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:56,067
YEAH.

651
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:57,567
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
MY GIRLFRIEND FOUND MINE

652
00:25:57,733 --> 00:26:00,500
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO.

653
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,200
I ASKED HER TO RECORD
THE GAME ON ESPN,

654
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:04,167
WHICH SHE DID,
BUT NOT ESPN HD.

655
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,133
AND THEN SHE SAYS,

656
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,900
"WELL, AT LEAST YOU STILL
GET TO WATCH IT."

657
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,800
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

658
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,067
NO, I PAY EXTRA MONEY
SO I CAN WATCH TV

659
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,967
LIKE POOR PEOPLE.

660
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,767
I DON'T EVEN FEEL BAD

661
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,067
FOR CHEATING ON YOU
THIS WEEKEND.

662
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:21,267
[audience ohs]

663
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:23,700
WE HAVE A RULE IN MY HOUSE.

664
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:26,833
IF I'M ASHAMED,
IT DOESN'T COUNT.

665
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:28,900
YOU GOTTA PLOW A FOUR
TO APPRECIATE AN EIGHT.

666
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:31,867
[laughter]

667
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,700
THAT'S MY MANTRA.
YEAH.

668
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,567
I'LL COME HOME FROM
A ROAD TRIP AND BE LIKE,

669
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,567
"YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL."

670
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:40,233
SHE'S LIKE,
"OH, YOU MUST HAVE

671
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,700
BEEN WITH A PIG
THIS WEEKEND."

672
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:46,467
I DON'T CHEAT ON HER.
IT'S A JOKE.

673
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,167
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I HATE MY GIRLFRIEND.

674
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,200
I...

675
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:53,500
HATE BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP,
BUT I'M FAITHFUL.

676
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,333
THAT'S THE RULE.

677
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,600
YOU WANT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
TO WORK,

678
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,300
YOU HAVE TO BE FAITHFUL.

679
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,367
UH, TIGER WOODS,
JESSE JAMES,

680
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:01,967
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOVE
THAT SIMPLE RULE.

681
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:03,967
THEY'RE NOT.
NOBODY IS.

682
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,933
AND YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT
TO WOMEN EITHER, LIKE--

683
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,933
MY GIRLFRIEND'LL BE LIKE,
"OH, MY GOODNESS,

684
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,067
LIKE, YOU REALLY WANNA
HOOK UP WITH SOME SKANK?"

685
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,500
OH, OH, WHOA.

686
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:14,633
IT'S NOT YOU VERSUS SKANK,
HONEY.

687
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,633
IT'S YOU VERSUS EVERY SKANK.

688
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
DO YOU SEE HOW
THE SCALE SHIFTS

689
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,333
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
AT THAT POINT?

690
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,633
IT'S LIKE, SHE'S
A MIGHTY SPARTAN WARRIOR.

691
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,133
BUT THERE'S
ALL THESE PERSIAN WHORES...

692
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,833
THAT WILL EVENTUALLY
KILL HER.

693
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:36,100
[laughter]

694
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:38,100
SHE GETS THE MESSAGE.

695
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:41,467
[laughter]

696
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:44,833
CANNOT BELIEVE JESSE JAMES
CHEATED ON SANDRA BULLOCK.

697
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:49,133
WHO COULD HAVE EVER GUESSED

698
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,900
THAT JESSE JAMES...

699
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:56,300
WOULD NOT TAKE VOWS
TO THE LORD SERIOUSLY?

700
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,633
I MEAN, WHOA...

701
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,767
DID THAT COME OUT OF NOWHERE.

702
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:02,533
SURE, WIFE NUMBER TWO

703
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,200
USED TO RECEIVE BUKKAKE
FOR MONEY.

704
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,700
BUT THIS GUY SEEMS LIKE

705
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,467
HE WAS A REAL
STRAIGHT SHOOTER.

706
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:11,167
[laughter]

707
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,133
[cheers and applause]

708
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,600
AND THE WOMEN--THE WOMEN
THAT HE HOOKED UP WITH

709
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:16,333
ARE COVERED IN TATTOOS.

710
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,200
OH, IT'S SO REPULSIVE.

711
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:19,967
I LIKE WHEN PEOPLE
ACT SHOCKED BECAUSE

712
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,200
SOMEBODY HAS TATTOOS
ALL OVER THEM.

713
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,200
"WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

714
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:25,233
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE AT 90?"

715
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,533
NOBODY
THAT'S COVERED IN TATTOOS

716
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,367
WILL EVER LIVE TO SEE 90.

717
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,767
[laughter]

718
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:33,667
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN STRUGGLING
WITH LIFE'S PROBLEMS.

719
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,467
I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW
WHO I SHOULD TALK TO?

720
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,067
THAT WISE OLD MAN
THAT HAS A SNAKE

721
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:38,933
COILED AROUND HIS NECK.

722
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,767
IF EVER THERE WAS A MAN

723
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:42,500
THAT WAS BATTING 1,000
IN LIFE,

724
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,667
IT'S THE GUY THAT HAS
A SPIDER

725
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,100
PERMANENTLY ON
HIS FUCKING FACE.

726
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,400
I HATE TATTOOS.

727
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,333
THAT BEING SAID,
I HAVE A FEW.

728
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,233
EVERY YEAR ON MY BIRTHDAY,

729
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,467
I GET A SMALL DASH
ON MY INNER THIGH

730
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:03,833
WHERE MY BALLS
CURRENTLY HANG.

731
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:08,167
[laughter]

732
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,167
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE

733
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,067
A BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ART
WHEN IT'S FINISHED.

734
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,600
MY GRANDKIDS
ARE PLAYING WITH MY BALLS,

735
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:16,600
THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

736
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,300
THEY'RE LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL
ARE THESE THINGS?"

737
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,767
I'M LIKE,
"IT'S YOUR FUTURE.

738
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,500
READ THE CHART."

739
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,733
THEY DON'T STOP GROWING.
THEY'RE LIKE EARLOBES.

740
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,967
[laughter]

741
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,067
THAT JOKE WAS INSPIRED BY
A DOOR THAT WASN'T LOCKED

742
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,733
WHEN I WAS 11.

743
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,067
[laughter]

744
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,267
I DID LOVE THE MOVIE
 THE BLIND SIDE.

745
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:38,300
MAN, THAT WAS INSPIRING.

746
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,433
SO MUCH SO THAT NOW
WHENEVER I'M DRIVING MY CAR

747
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,900
AND I SEE A BLACK PERSON
WALKING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

748
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,633
I PULL UP RIGHT NEXT TO HIM,
ROLL THE WINDOW DOWN--

749
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,100
KEEP IT LOCKED,
I'M NOT SILLY--

750
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:50,367
CHECK THEIR 40 TIME.

751
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:53,433
IF IT'S UNDER 4:30,
I'M LIKE, "GET IN THE CAR."

752
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,533
LIKE, "I'M NOT HOMELESS."

753
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,500
"GET IN THE CAR!
I'M YOUR NEW FATHER."

754
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:01,000
[laughter]

755
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,367
WASN'T THAT THE MESSAGE
TO THE MOVIE...

756
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:05,167
THAT KIDNAPPING
CAN BE PROFITABLE?

757
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,200
[laughter]

758
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:10,000
HOW ABOUT
THOSE WINTER OLYMPICS?

759
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:11,700
THEY WERE EXCITING,
WEREN'T THEY?

760
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,600
FINALLY,
WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT

761
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,233
WHICH COUNTRY CAN SLIDE DOWN
A HILL FASTER.

762
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,167
NOT GEORGIA.

763
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,433
[audience ohs]
OOH.

764
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,333
OH, I'M SORRY.

765
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,200
BIG LUGE FANS, ARE YOU,
HERE IN SAN FRAN?

766
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,900
TAKE THAT LUGE SERIOUSLY,
DON'T YOU?

767
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,167
IF I KNOW SAN FRANCISCO
LIKE I THINK I DO,

768
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,467
IT'S THAT YOU LOVE SOURDOUGH
AND LUGE.

769
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:37,167
[laughter and cheers]

770
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,433
THE WINTER OLYMPICS
ARE POINTLESS.

771
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,267
I'LL SAY THAT.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

772
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,200
I ASSUME THE ONLY REASON
WE HAVE THEM

773
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,400
IS SO WHITE PEOPLE
FEEL RELEVANT IN SPORTS.

774
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:47,267
[laughter]

775
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:49,000
BECAUSE OTHER THAN THAT,
THE ONLY THING

776
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,900
THE WINTER OLYMPICS
SHOW ME IS

777
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:52,533
WHICH COUNTRY
HAS MORE RICH WHITE KIDS?

778
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,200
WHAT'S IT COST TO GO SKIING?

779
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:56,133
$900 A DAY?

780
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,000
"OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT'S NOT MORE POPULAR

781
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,067
IN THE INNER CITIES."

782
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,067
HMM.

783
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,800
"HEY, LATRELL, YOU WANNA PLAY
BASKETBALL TODAY?"

784
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:04,933
"NO, MAN, I'M GOING TO
BRECKENRIDGE."

785
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,933
"OH.

786
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,833
"LAH-DEE UNCLE TOM DAH.

787
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,733
LATRELL'S GOING TO
BRECKENRIDGE."

788
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,267
[laughter]

789
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:16,133
I HATE THE SUMMER GAMES,
FOR THAT MATTER.

790
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,067
I JUST DON'T WANT PARENTS
TO BE REWARDED

791
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:19,800
FOR ENCOURAGING THEIR KIDS

792
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:21,633
TO FORFEIT
THEIR ENTIRE CHILDHOOD

793
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
PERFECTING A SPORT
NO ONE CARES ABOUT

794
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,700
FOR 3 YEARS AND 11 MONTHS
AT A TIME,

795
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,733
THEN FOR ONE MONTH
I'VE GOT TO ACT AS IF

796
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,067
THE VAULT AFFECTS
MY PATRIOTISM.

797
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,900
IT DOESN'T.

798
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,067
I HOPE YOU MISS THE JUMP
AND RIB CAGE IT.

799
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,333
YEAH.

800
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,933
DO THAT FOR OLD GLORY.

801
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,900
ENJOY YOUR EATING DISORDER,

802
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:40,300
ASK YOUR MOM WHY
YOU STOPPED GROWING AT 4'3",

803
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:44,067
AND REMEMBER, EVERY GUY SAYS
HAMMERTOE'S A DEAL BREAKER.

804
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,667
I'M NOT TOUCHING YOUR FEET,
MARY LOU.

805
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,900
THEY'RE DISGUSTING.

806
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:50,533
[cheers and applause]

807
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,633
AND HOW BAD IS THAT
MEDAL CEREMONY?

808
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,600
UGH. IT'S HORRIBLE.

809
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:57,867
I HATE OUR FUCKIN' ANTHEM.

810
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:01,133
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM BLOWS.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

811
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,100
DO ANY OF YOU HAVE IT
ON YOUR IPOD?

812
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,400
"WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO?"

813
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:07,500
"OH, THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

814
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,267
"I LOVE IT.

815
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,300
IT JUST REALLY GETS ME
JAZZED UP."

816
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,200
I WANT MY OWN COUNTRY.

817
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,500
IF ONE OF MY ATHLETES MEDALS,
OH, HO-HO,

818
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,633
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

819
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,800
BECAUSE MY NATIONAL ANTHEM'S
GONNA BE 32 MINUTES LONG.

820
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,567
JUST SO
BRONZE AND SILVER GO,

821
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,933
"WHAT THE FUCK?
HOW LONG IS THIS?"

822
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,733
IT'S LIKE, "KNOCK IT OFF,
LOSERS.

823
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,667
"YOU'RE BEING
VERY DISRESPECTFUL.

824
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:31,300
THERE'S A NINE-MINUTE
GUITAR SOLO COMING."

825
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:32,967
"WAS THAT NOVEMBER RAIN?"

826
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:37,467
[laughter]

827
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:40,800
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S MORE EMBARRASSING

828
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,700
IN THIS COUNTRY:

829
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:43,933
THAT MICHAEL PHELPS
FELL FROM THE GRACES

830
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,067
FOR SMOKING MARIJUANA

831
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,067
OR THAT YOU LOOKED UP TO
A SWIMMER IN THE FIRST PLACE?

832
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,867
[laughs]

833
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,167
[cheers and applause]

834
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,733
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

835
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,633
SWIMMING?

836
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,067
YOU MEAN THAT THING
YOU INSTINCTIVELY DO

837
00:32:57,233 --> 00:33:00,067
BEFORE YOU DIE?

838
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,667
"YEAH,
BUT HE'S REALLY FAST, IT'S...

839
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:06,700
PRETTY HEROIC."

840
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:08,200
THE FIRST THING
MICHAEL PHELPS SHOULD HAVE DONE

841
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:09,933
WHEN THAT PHOTO CAME OUT

842
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,933
WAS CALL KOBE BRYANT'S
PUBLICIST.

843
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,333
BECAUSE KOBE WAS ACCUSED
OF RAPE.

844
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,400
AND ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS SETTLE IN CIVIL COURT

845
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:18,067
FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
CHANGE HIS JERSEY NUMBER,

846
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,667
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP,

847
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:20,867
AND THAT SOULLESS TOWN
IN L.A.

848
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:23,100
COULDN'T BE PROUDER.

849
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,833
YEAH, I JUST HOPE
WHEN PARENTS LET THEIR KIDS

850
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,633
RUN AROUND IN NUMBER 24
JERSEYS,

851
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,567
THEY HAVE THE DECENCY
TO BE LIKE,

852
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:29,600
"OH, COME ON.
NUMBER EIGHT WAS THE RAPIST.

853
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,367
[laughter]

854
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:33,933
"24 JUST HAS A GREAT
WORK ETHIC.

855
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,500
AND AN UNBLOCKABLE
TURNAROUND."

856
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:38,467
[laughter]

857
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:40,267
MICHAEL PHELPS.

858
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:41,533
HE WON 13 GOLD MEDALS
IN BEIJING,

859
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,533
WHICH I'M TOLD IS A LOT.

860
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,933
WAIT TILL HE COMPETES
IN THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS

861
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,467
BECAUSE HE WILL CLEAN UP.

862
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:49,167
AND YEAH, HE'LL GET IN.
HE HAS AN UNDERBITE.

863
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,267
THAT'S A SIGN OF DOWN'S.

864
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:54,367
HOW IS THAT GUY
SHATTERING WORLD RECORDS

865
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,733
WITH THAT MOUTH
FILLING WITH WATER

866
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,933
ON EVERY STROKE?

867
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,967
[laughter]

868
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,800
KNOCK IT OFF WITH
SHAVING YOUR BALLS.

869
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:04,067
AN ORTHODONTIST
COULD GET THREE SECONDS

870
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,467
OFF YOUR BEST TIME.

871
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:09,200
AND I DON'T KNOW
ALL THE RULES TO YOUR "SPORT,"

872
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:11,167
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
YOUR EARS CAN'T PADDLE.

873
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,400
[laughter]

874
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:15,133
AND THEN WHAT DID WE DO?

875
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,167
WE AWARDED HIM
50 MOST BEAUTIFUL.

876
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,967
I CAN ONLY ASSUME
WE WERE DOING A NECK DOWN ISSUE.

877
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:22,267
LET ME GUESS.
FERGIE WAS ON THE COVER?

878
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:24,433
UGH. 'CAUSE SHE'S FUGLY.

879
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,233
HO-HO.

880
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,100
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HER?
NO ONE HAS.

881
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,567
CAMERAS HOLD ON HER
ABOUT THAT LONG

882
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:33,100
BEFORE RECORD SALES DIP.

883
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:35,433
I MEAN, SHE CAN'T SING
AND SHE'S UGLY?

884
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
THANKS FOR RUINING
THE BLACK EYED PEAS.

885
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:40,067
SOME OF YOU STILL LIKE THEM?

886
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:42,267
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE 2000-AND-LATE.

887
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,933
I'VE GOT A FEELING.

888
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:52,900
KANGAROOS
CAN'T HOP BACKWARDS.

889
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:56,767
IT'S NOT VERY FUNNY,
BUT YOU LEARNED SOMETHING.

890
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:58,100
I DON'T CARE
HOW DRUNK YOU GET TONIGHT.

891
00:34:58,267 --> 00:35:00,900
YOU WILL NEVER FORGET THAT.

892
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,867
YOU'LL BE IN AUSTRALIA
NINE YEARS FROM NOW.

893
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,833
YOUR FRIEND WILL GET ATTACKED
BY A KANGAROO,

894
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:07,767
AND YOU'LL INSTINCTIVELY YELL,
"GET BEHIND HIM.

895
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:10,333
"WAIT, HOW DID I KNOW
TO SAY THAT?

896
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,067
"HOW DID I KNOW
TO SAY THAT?

897
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:14,367
"AM I A WIZARD?

898
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:16,233
"HAVE I ALWAYS BEEN
A WIZARD?

899
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,433
WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T
I HAVE A DEMON?"

900
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,900
[scattered laughter]

901
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:23,867
I LOVE SNAPPLE FACTS.

902
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,700
I WISH THEY WOULD HIRE ME.

903
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:27,533
I'D GIVE 'EM FACTS.
THEY'D BE SILLY.

904
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,133
LIKE, BABIES AREN'T
DISHWASHER-SAFE.

905
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,100
PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE,
"OH, MY GOODNESS.

906
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:34,667
"WHO DOESN'T KNOW THIS?

907
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,167
"WELL, I GUESS IF THEY KEEP
ONE BABY OUT OF THE DISHWASHER,

908
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,533
"THEY'RE DOING A GOOD THING
OVER THERE.

909
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,800
THANKS, SUMMER PEACH."

910
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,633
I PREFER THE TEAS.

911
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,533
THIS IS MY IMPRESSION
OF JOHNNY DEPP

912
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,533
BEFORE HE LEAVES HIS HOUSE
AT NIGHT.

913
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,867
IF YOU DON'T KNOW,
JOHNNY DEPP'S 48 YEARS OLD.

914
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,700
I ASSUME IT GOES LIKE THIS.

915
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,533
"HOLD ON, GUYS,
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

916
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,600
"I HAVE TO PUT ON
ANOTHER BRACELET.

917
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:58,333
"I ONLY HAVE SIX ON.
I WANT TO WEAR SEVEN TONIGHT.

918
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,300
"NOW I KNOW
YOU'RE IN A HURRY,

919
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:01,667
"BUT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
MY BELT IS ASKEW

920
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,667
"AND MY HANDKERCHIEF IS JUST SO,

921
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:06,500
BECAUSE I'M ALMOST 50
AND I LOVE ACCESSORIES."

922
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,133
COOL SHOULD HAVE A CUTOFF.

923
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,400
AND MY VOTE IS 48.

924
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,500
THE TV SHOW INTERVENTION

925
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:14,867
IS LIKE PUNK'D FOR JUNKIES.

926
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:17,233
[laughter]

927
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:23,567
I LIKE WATCHING MOVIES ON DVD.

928
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:25,433
I DON'T NEED ALL THE EXTRAS.

929
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,500
I DON'T NEED TO SEE
ALTERNATE ENDINGS.

930
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:28,733
THEY'RE NEVER THAT DIFFERENT.
THEY'RE JUST LONGER,

931
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,800
A FEW MORE SWEAR WORDS,

932
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:32,700
AND A BOOB THAT THE GENERAL
PUBLIC COULDN'T HANDLE.

933
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:33,967
IF YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
ALTERNATE ENDINGS,

934
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:35,933
YOU BETTER BLOW ME AWAY.

935
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,767
LET ME WATCH THE MIGHTY DUCKS
WITH MY NEPHEW.

936
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:39,133
YEAH.
WE WATCHED THE ALTERNATE ENDING

937
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,067
WHERE THEY LOSE THE HOCKEY GAME,

938
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,200
AND THEN THEY GO BACK
TO THE LOCKER ROOM,

939
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,533
AND THEY START DOING BLOW
AND JERKING OFF ON EACH OTHER.

940
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,233
EMILIO'S DEAD IN THE SHOWER.

941
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,867
YOU'RE LIKE, "HOLY COW.
WHOA.

942
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:52,067
"DID YOU SEE
THE ALTERNATE ENDING?

943
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:56,933
"NO, NO, NO, THEY WENT IN A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

944
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,133
"I THINK DISNEY WAS SMART
WITH THE ORIGINAL.

945
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,733
THAT ALTERNATE ENDING WAS A
LITTLE TOO HEAVY FOR THE KIDS."

946
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,767
THAT'S DISNEY.

947
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:06,200
ALWAYS SNEAKING IN
SUBLIMINAL STUFF ON OUR MOVIES.

948
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,900
DID YOU KNOW THERE'S A PENIS
ON THE LITTLE MERMAID BOX?

949
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:11,433
YOU TRY TO DRAW ARIEL
FOR SIX MONTHS

950
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,700
AND NOT PUT A DICK SOMEWHERE.

951
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:17,367
GOD, I LOVE THAT FISH HALF.

952
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:20,367
LIBERAL.

953
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,467
YOU EVER HAVE SOMEBODY
CLOSE TO YOU DIE

954
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:24,100
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, THE LAST
THING I SAID TO THEM WAS

955
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:26,667
I HOPE
YOU GET DICK CANCER."?

956
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,733
RIGHT, THAT'S AN AWFUL
LAST THING TO HAVE SAID.

957
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,267
THAT'S WHY
I DON'T SAY IT ANYMORE.

958
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:34,800
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

959
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:36,567
I DON'T SEE MY MOTHER
VERY OFTEN,

960
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:38,833
BUT WHEN I DO, OOH,
I MAKE SURE

961
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:41,233
I END EVERY CONVERSATION
WITH SOMETHING SO PROFOUND

962
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,933
JUST ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT
SHE DOES KICK THE BUCKET,

963
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,833
I CAN STILL HAVE
A RELATIVELY DECENT WEEKEND.

964
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:49,867
RIGHT, BUT IT'S HARD.

965
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,800
'CAUSE SHE WILL RAMBLE
ON THE PHONE FOREVER

966
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:53,767
ABOUT NOTHING.

967
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:56,067
"DANIEL, I JUST FINISHED
A 500-PIECE PUZZLE,

968
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:59,267
AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS,
I DID THE CORNERS LAST."

969
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,533
[laughter]

970
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,800
"I WILL BELIEVE IT,
AND I GOT TO GO.

971
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:06,200
"BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW

972
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,200
THAT YOU'RE A ROSE
IN A FIELD OF DAISIES."

973
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,867
AND SHE'S LIKE,
"I WANT YOU TO KNOW

974
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:13,933
THAT YOU CAN COME OUT
OF THE CLOSET ANY DAY NOW."

975
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,800
"EASY, WHORE."

976
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:18,633
I DON'T SAY THAT.

977
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,200
THEN MY BROTHER
WOULD GET EVERYTHING.

978
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:27,067
A LITTLE GIRL WAS KILLED
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD RECENTLY.

979
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,067
WHICH IS SAD,
BUT IT HAPPENS.

980
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,967
NOT USUALLY IN WHITE
NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT IT HAPPENS.

981
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:35,300
I THINK THERE'S A PIE CHART
THAT PROVES THAT SOMEWHERE.

982
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:36,600
SMALL SLIVER.
SAFER.

983
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,067
SHE WAS KILLED ON A STREET

984
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,333
WHERE PEOPLE HAD BEEN
COMPLAINING FOR YEARS

985
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,167
THAT CARS DRIVE TOO FAST,

986
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,600
SO REACTIVE IN NATURE
AS EVERYONE IS,

987
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:47,433
AFTER THE HORRIBLE ACCIDENT,

988
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,567
THEY HAD A BUNCH OF SPEED BUMPS
PUT IN.

989
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:51,567
AND I THOUGHT, WOW, WHAT
A HORRIBLE WAY FOR THEIR FAMILY

990
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:54,133
TO REMEMBER EVERY TIME
THEY DRIVE DOWN THAT ROAD.

991
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,867
BA-BOOM.
[whimpers]

992
00:38:56,067 --> 00:39:00,433
"NATALIE!

993
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,433
"YOUR MOTHER AND I MISS YOU
SO MUCH.

994
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,433
"BUT YOU ARE REALLY DOING
A NUMBER ON OUR SUSPENSION.

995
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,800
"NO, HONEY, I TOLD YOU
WE SHOULD HAVE LEASED THIS CAR.

996
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,667
"EVEN IN THE AFTERLIFE,
SHE MAKES US FIGHT.

997
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,600
GOOD RIDDANCE."

998
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,733
YEAH, YOU SEE
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

999
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,600
IN THE BEGINNING
OF THIS MADE-UP STORY,

1000
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,300
YOU FELT BAD FOR THE FAMILY.

1001
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,133
NOW, AT THE END,
YOU REALIZE

1002
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,067
THEY WEREN'T FIT PARENTS
TO BEGIN WITH.

1003
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,900
WE'VE ALL GROWN.

1004
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:30,600
LET'S MOVE ON
TO SOME NONFICTION.

1005
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:34,467
DO YOU REMEMBER

1006
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,367
WHEN THAT KID WAS KILLED
AT SIX FLAGS,

1007
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:38,433
HAD HIS HEAD CUT OFF
BY THE ROLLER COASTER?

1008
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
OH, MAN, THE FIRST THING
THAT WENT THROUGH MY MIND

1009
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:43,667
WAS, "WOW, HOW AM I GONNA
MAKE THIS FUNNY FOR EVERYBODY?"

1010
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:47,500
HERE GOES.

1011
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,267
IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER
THE STORY,

1012
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:51,067
HE WAS ON
A CHURCH YOUTH GROUP.

1013
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,167
HE WAS ON
A ROLLER COASTER RIDE.

1014
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,433
HIS HAT BLEW OFF.

1015
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,267
AFTER THE RIDE WAS OVER,

1016
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:57,200
HE'S LIKE,
"I'M GONNA GO GET MY HAT."

1017
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:59,133
AND THERE WAS A BIG FENCE
WITH SIGNS ON IT

1018
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,867
THAT PROBABLY SAID,
"HEY, CUT YOUR LOSSES."

1019
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,600
AND HE'S LIKE,
"WHAT?

1020
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,967
"HAVE YOU SEEN ME
IN THAT HAT?

1021
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,800
NOT TODAY, FENCE."

1022
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:09,767
AND HE WENT OVER IT.

1023
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:11,700
AND THERE WAS A SECOND FENCE
WITH MORE SIGNS.

1024
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,200
LIKE, "COME ON.
KNOCK IT OFF."

1025
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:17,133
HE'S LIKE, "YOU CAN'T TELL ME
HOW TO LIVE, SIGNS."

1026
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,933
AND HE WENT OVER THAT FENCE.

1027
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,467
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE,
THE STORY ENDS.

1028
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:25,367
DID HE GET THE HAT?
I'D LIKE TO THINK HE DID.

1029
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,100
RIGHT?
A SMALL SILVER LINING.

1030
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:28,767
LIKE, "I TOLD YOU
I'D GET IT."

1031
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:30,800
AND THEN WHACK,
RIGHT THEN.

1032
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:32,600
AND I KNOW
HE WAS ON A CHURCH YOUTH GROUP,

1033
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,700
AND THEY DON'T BELIEVE
IN EVOLUTION,

1034
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:36,633
BUT THAT KID WAS GETTING
PICKED OFF SOONER OR LATER.

1035
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,867
YEAH.

1036
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,967
[laughter and applause]

1037
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,033
AND IF I WERE
A FAMILY MEMBER,

1038
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,500
I'D SAY 15 YEARS
WAS A PRETTY GOOD RUN.

1039
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:47,867
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I'M HALF FULL.

1040
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:52,133
THE REAL STORY, WHICH NOBODY
TALKS ABOUT UNTIL NOW,

1041
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,900
IS HOW HE WAS DECAPITATED.

1042
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,600
IT WAS
A SUSPENSION ROLLER COASTER.

1043
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,333
A YOUNG LADY,
25 YEARS OLD,

1044
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,233
HER LEG
IS WHAT DECAPITATED HIM.

1045
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,667
SHATTERED HER LEG
IN OVER EIGHT PLACES.

1046
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,400
SHE HAD TO HAVE THREE SURGERIES

1047
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:04,333
AND WEAR A CAST
FOR OVER A YEAR.

1048
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,367
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER WORN
A CAST OR NOT,

1049
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,267
BUT EVERYBODY AND THEIR MOTHER
WILL COME UP TO YOU

1050
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,400
AND BE LIKE,
"HOW'D YOU BREAK YOUR LEG?"

1051
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,433
[laughter]

1052
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,200
SHE GETS TO BE LIKE,
"I FUCKING PUNTED A GUY'S HEAD

1053
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:17,900
90 YARDS.
YEAH.

1054
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:20,300
TOP THAT, JANIKOWSKI."

1055
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:25,400
OH, FINALLY A RAIDER REFERENCE
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE SUCKING.

1056
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,433
[cheers]

1057
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:37,867
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS TOLD ME
I HAVE A SICK SENSE OF HUMOR.

1058
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:40,233
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
I ASSUME IT'S RELATIVE.

1059
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,067
WHO ARE YOU COMPARING ME TO?
CARROT TOP?

1060
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,500
THEN, YEAH,
I'M A LITTLE BLUE.

1061
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,067
TO MY CIRCLE OF FRIENDS,
I'M TAME.

1062
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:48,567
MY SISTER'S OFF THE CHARTS.

1063
00:41:48,733 --> 00:41:51,167
I PLAY PRACTICAL JOKES ON HER
CONSTANTLY, THOUGH.

1064
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,300
I GOT HER SO GOOD
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

1065
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:57,267
I REPLACED HER PEPPER SPRAY
WITH SILLY STRING.

1066
00:41:57,433 --> 00:42:00,500
ANYWAY, THAT NIGHT,
SHE GOT RAPED,

1067
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,833
AND SHE CALLED ME
THE NEXT DAY,

1068
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:06,067
GOING, "YOU SON OF A BITCH.

1069
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,633
"YOU GOT ME SO GOOD.

1070
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,533
"NO, NO, NO, NO,
AS SOON

1071
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,733
"AS I STARTED SPRAYING HIM
IN THE FACE.

1072
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,600
"I'M LIKE, 'DANIEL.

1073
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:18,833
THIS IS GONNA REALLY HURT.'"

1074
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:22,600
[singsong]
HOT POCKET.

1075
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:24,567
THAT'S HOW THAT JOKE ENDS.

1076
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:26,967
I HAD ANOTHER COMIC FRIEND
OF MINE FINISH IT.

1077
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,067
I HATE RAIN.

1078
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,600
I UNDERSTAND
THE NECESSITY FOR IT.

1079
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,400
BUT WHEN I WALK OUTSIDE,
I PREFER IT TO BE SUNNY.

1080
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,367
THAT'S WHY I LOVE CALIFORNIA
SO MUCH.

1081
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:46,333
OH, AND I THINK
IT'S BECAUSE I WEAR A 35 INSEAM

1082
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,067
WHEN I'M CLEARLY A 34.

1083
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,233
BUT I'VE ALWAYS LIKED
MY PANTS LONG IN THE BACK.

1084
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,067
I LIKE 'EM TO HIT THE GROUND,
NATURALLY FRAY OVER TIME,

1085
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:54,967
BUT WHEN IT RAINS, OH.

1086
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:56,933
AM I RIGHT?
THE FRAY GETS WET,

1087
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,300
THEN THE PANT LEG

OH.

1241
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,067
YOU EVER ASK YOUR PARENTS
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER,

1242
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:23,067
"WHO DO YOU LOVE MORE, MOM?"

1243
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:24,333
SHE WAS LIKE,
"I LOVE YOU GUYS THE SAME."

1244
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,267
YOU WALK AWAY OKAY WITH IT.

1245
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:27,900
YOU'VE HEARD OF A TIE
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE.

1246
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:29,800
WHAT IS THE OCTOMOM GONNA DO?

1247
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,333
THERE'S NO WAY A 14-WAY TIE
IS BELIEVABLE.

1248
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,067
SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE HONEST.

1249
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:34,933
"WHO DO I LOVE MORE?
LET'S SEE.

1250
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,567
"FOUR OF YOU ARE RETARDED,
SO YOU'RE OUT.

1251
00:49:37,733 --> 00:49:43,133
NOW LET'S FOCUS ON KIDS
THAT HAVE EYELIDS."

1252
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,767
IS THIS THE JOKE THAT'S TOO FAR?

1253
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:46,867
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE.

1254
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,367
EVERYBODY WAS FINE WITH
MY SISTER GETTING RAPED, RIGHT?

1255
00:49:48,533 --> 00:49:49,800
OKAY.

1256
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:52,800
BUT THIS ONE...

1257
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:54,867
SPEAKING OF AWFUL PARENTS,

1258
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:57,367
JOE JACKSON DESERVES
A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD.

1259
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,800
HOLY COW.

1260
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,700
I LIKE WHEN PEOPLE ACTED SHOCKED
THAT MICHAEL DIED.

1261
00:50:01,867 --> 00:50:03,033
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1262
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,733
MICHAEL WAS ON BORROWED TIME

1263
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,267
AS SOON
AS HE SWITCHED RACES.

1264
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:11,500
DON'T ACT SO SAD
OVER HIS DEATH.

1265
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:13,867
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THERE'S A REASON--

1266
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:16,367
THERE'S A REASON
HIS REUNION TOUR WAS IN LONDON.

1267
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:18,300
NOBODY IN AMERICA WANTS
TO WATCH A 50-YEAR-OLD MAN

1268
00:50:18,467 --> 00:50:22,833
SCOOT BACKWARDS.

1269
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,300
BUT, OH, THAT PARENTING DEBATE,
TO SPANK YOUR KID

1270
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:29,400
OR NOT TO SPANK YOUR KID,
'CAUSE JOE SHOWS YOU,

1271
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:33,133
YEAH, YOU CAN, IN FACT,
BEAT YOUR CHILD TO GREATNESS.

1272
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,533
OH, BUT THE THIN RED LINE
YOU TOE.

1273
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,900
'CAUSE YOU WANT TO HIM ENOUGH
THAT HE HAS THE CREATIVE ANGST

1274
00:50:39,067 --> 00:50:40,733
TO ONE DAY GIVE YOU
THE THRILLER ALBUM

1275
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,867
BUT NOT SO MUCH
THAT HE FUCKS CHILDREN.

1276
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:47,500
YEAH.

1277
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:50,467
I'M NOT READY FOR KIDS.

1278
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:51,933
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I
COULD MAKE THAT DISTINCTION.

1279
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,900
WAS THAT TOO HARD?

1280
00:50:58,533 --> 00:50:59,633
HOW COME WHEN PEOPLE SAY
WORST-CASE SCENARIO,

1281
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,300
IT'S CLEARLY NOT?

1282
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:03,267
LIKE, YOU COULD ALWAYS ADD,

1283
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:04,600
"AND THEN A ROLLER COASTER
CUT MY HEAD OFF."

1284
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:08,700
[laughter]

1285
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:10,233
I HAVE A NEW TV SHOW
COMING OUT

1286
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,067
THAT I'M REALLY HYPED ABOUT.

1287
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,400
IT'S CALLED
 THE VAGINA WHISPERER,

1288
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:18,133
COPRODUCED BY CESAR MILLAN.

1289
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,233
IT'S FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING
TROUBLE IN THE BEDROOM.

1290
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,367
I COME OVER, I WATCH YOU
AND YOUR PARTNER MAKE LOVE,

1291
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:25,200
I MAKE SURE THE VAGINA IS
IN A CALM, SUBMISSIVE STATE

1292
00:51:25,367 --> 00:51:30,067
BY CONSTANTLY GOING,
"CHH. CHH. CHH. CHH.

1293
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:33,967
"CHH. CHH.
I HAVE A MEXICAN MOTHER AS WELL.

1294
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,233
CHH."

1295
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,367
THEN I ASK YOU TO STEP ASIDE.
I SHOW YOU HOW I WOULD DO IT.

1296
00:51:40,533 --> 00:51:43,733
THEN THE LAST 58 MINUTES OR SO
IS ME APOLOGIZING,

1297
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,900
TRYING TO TELL YOU
THIS NEVER HAPPENS,

1298
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:49,833
AND RECOMMENDING THAT WE PUT
THIS VAGINA DOWN.

1299
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:52,500
I DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE
TO BRING HOME TO MY PACK.

1300
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:58,467
I WAS MAKING LOVE
TO THIS GIRL RECENTLY,

1301
00:51:58,633 --> 00:52:01,633
LET'S SAY SHE'S 19.

1302
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,800
THERE'S NO BOUNCER
IN MY BEDROOM.

1303
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:07,333
YOU'RE IN.

1304
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,100
SHE SAYS TO ME
DURING THE ACT OF LOVEMAKING,

1305
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:13,067
"HEY, DANIEL, WHAT'S IT LIKE
HAVING SEX WITH A CONDOM ON?"

1306
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:16,567
I'M LIKE,
"HOW SHOULD I KNOW?"

1307
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:19,133
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
WE NEED TIME MACHINES.

1308
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,567
WHAT I SAID
WAS WAY LESS ROMANTIC.

1309
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:24,667
I SAID, "OH.

1310
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:29,367
IT'S A LOT LIKE PICKING UP
DOG SHIT WITH A BAG."

1311
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:33,200
WHICH I THOUGHT THEN AND THINK
NOW IS A SPOT-ON ANALOGY.

1312
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:36,367
LIKE, YOU KNOW
THERE'S DOG POO IN YOUR HAND,

1313
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:41,833
BUT YOU DON'T FREAK OUT.

1314
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:45,233
[applause]

1315
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,333
BARACK OBAMA WENT
WITH A PORTUGUESE WATER DOG.

1316
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,767
WHAT?

1317
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,967
WHAT A MISTAKE.

1318
00:52:52,133 --> 00:52:53,733
I WAS HOPING SO BAD
THAT HE WOULD ADOPT

1319
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,333
ONE OF MICHAEL VICK'S DOGS.

1320
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,600
WHAT?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1321
00:52:57,767 --> 00:52:59,467
HOW GREAT WOULD THAT BE?

1322
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:01,400
OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT
TO WALK OUT

1323
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,800
ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN
WITH A PIT BULL.

1324
00:53:02,967 --> 00:53:05,233
JUST TAKE A GANGSTER KNEE

1325
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,133
AND PRAY THE MEDIA DOESN'T WRITE
SOMETHING RACIST, LIKE,

1326
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,367
OH...

1327
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:13,500
"SLEEP TIGHT, AMERICA.
DMX HAS GOT OUR BACK."

1328
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:18,633
BARACK OBAMA
DOESN'T INSPIRE ME.

1329
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,067
GEORGE W. INSPIRED ME,
BECAUSE I COULD LOOK

1330
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,467
AT HIM AND BE LIKE,
"OH, I COULD DO THAT."

1331
00:53:24,633 --> 00:53:26,633
BARACK SET THE BAR
A LITTLE OUT OF REACH.

1332
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,933
YOU WANT ME TO HELP
IN THE COMMUNITY?

1333
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,533
THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.

1334
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,533
WHEN DO WE GET
TO BE SELFISH AGAIN?

1335
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,600
THAT'S THE COUNTRY
I WAS BORN INTO.

1336
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,900
SOMETIMES WHEN I'M OUT AT NIGHT
AND I SEE A GROUP OF WOMEN,

1337
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:42,833
I LIKE TO WALK UP TO 'EM
AND PRETEND THAT I'M A JUDGE

1338
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:45,467
AT A DOG SHOW.

1339
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:47,633
AND I JUST GO,
"MM.

1340
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,067
"THIRD, SECOND, FIRST.

1341
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:53,067
IN THAT ORDER!"

1342
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,167
[applause]

1343
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,200
THEY LOVE IT.

1344
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,067
THEY WANT TO BE JUDGED.

1345
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,333
THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME
GETTING READY.

1346
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,933
THERE'S NOT A GIRL IN HERE THAT
WOULDN'T LIKE TO GO HOME TONIGHT

1347
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,833
WITH A BLUE RIBBON ON.

1348
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:08,700
HER FRIEND'S LIKE, "WHERE DID
YOU GET THAT UGLY RIBBON?"

1349
00:54:08,867 --> 00:54:12,300
"OH, SOME GUY AT THE BAR
THOUGHT I WON."

1350
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:14,067
"KATIE DIDN'T EVEN PLACE.
I KNOW.

1351
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,667
IT'S CRAZY."

1352
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:19,700
IF I SEE
A REALLY HOT CHICK,

1353
00:54:19,867 --> 00:54:21,367
I'LL GRAB HER BY THE CROTCH
AND THE THROAT

1354
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:25,833
AND BE LIKE,
"BEST IN SHOW."

1355
00:54:26,067 --> 00:54:28,367
LITTLE HEAVY.

1356
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:31,567
SHOULD HAVE PICKED ONE
FROM THE TOY GROUP.

1357
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:33,467
BIG CAN BE BEAUTIFUL.

1358
00:54:33,633 --> 00:54:34,767
OKAY?

1359
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:37,067
JUST NOT TO ME.

1360
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,633
I FIND YOU DISGUSTING.

1361
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,100
FRESHMAN 15'S
NOT A LIFE SENTENCE.

1362
00:54:42,267 --> 00:54:44,500
OKAY?

1363
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:47,900
I KNOW THIS IS AWKWARD RIGHT NOW
FOR SOME OF US.

1364
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:50,633
"HE WANTS US TO EAT HEALTHY
AND EXERCISE.

1365
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,767
WHAT A JERK."

1366
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:56,933
WE'RE TOO FAT.

1367
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,533
WE'RE JUST TOO FAT.

1368
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,567
I WAS ON A PLANE RECENTLY

1369
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:02,500
THAT WAS DELAYED
OVER THREE HOURS AT THE GATE

1370
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:05,200
BECAUSE THEY RAN OUT
OF SEATBELT EXTENSIONS.

1371
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:06,967
YEAH.
'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYMORE.

1372
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:08,800
THEY WERE OUT.
LIKE, WE HAD TO WAIT

1373
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:11,067
FOR AN INBOUND FLIGHT
OF FAT PEOPLE

1374
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:14,433
TO GET THEIR SEATBELT EXTENSIONS
TO BRING OVER TO OUR FLIGHT.

1375
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,767
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT SEATBELT EXTENSIONS ARE?

1376
00:55:15,933 --> 00:55:17,733
SEATBELTS ONLY GO THIS BIG.

1377
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,367
[laughter]

1378
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,233
SOME PEOPLE NEED

1379
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,800
AN EXTRA 6 1/2 FEET OF NYLON
TO STRAP IN.

1380
00:55:29,967 --> 00:55:35,667
AS IF ANY COLLISION
WOULD UNWEDGE THEM.

1381
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,800
YOU EVER BEEN ON A FLIGHT
AND A BUNCH OF VIRGIN FLIERS

1382
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,200
APPLAUD LIKE MORONS
AFTER A SUCCESSFUL LANDING?

1383
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:42,767
I ALWAYS PRAY
THAT THOSE SAME PEOPLE WERE

1384
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:45,667
ON THE U.S. AIRWAYS FLIGHT
THAT LANDED IN THE HUDSON RIVER

1385
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:49,067
AND THEY JUST WENT,
"BOO. BOO.

1386
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,167
"WHAT IS THIS?

1387
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:54,100
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ON LAND,
YOU DICK."

1388
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:58,367
NEW YORK GETS
ALL THE COOL PLANE CRASHES.

1389
00:55:58,533 --> 00:56:02,267
[audience ohs]

1390
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:04,133
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE COOL'S
NOT THE RIGHT WORD,

1391
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,967
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

1392
00:56:07,133 --> 00:56:09,100
I LOVE THAT THE MODELING
INDUSTRY GETS ATTACKED

1393
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:10,233
FOR BEING TOO SKINNY.

1394
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,600
REALLY, AMERICA?

1395
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:16,067
YOU'RE NOT TOO BIG?

1396
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:21,900
IS SOMETHING IN YOUR MOUTH?

1397
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:23,600
DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY SAY THAT?

1398
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,400
THAT MODELS ARE TOO SKINNY?

1399
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:27,300
IT'S BECAUSE
PARENTS ARE HORRIBLE.

1400
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,100
THEY CAN'T TELL
THEIR 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

1401
00:56:29,267 --> 00:56:30,700
THAT SHE'S NOT REALLY
A PRINCESS.

1402
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:33,200
WELL, GUESS WHAT,
I CAN.

1403
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,833
IF YOU'RE 16 YEARS OLD
AND YOU THINK

1404
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:38,667
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU
AND GISELLE IS YOUR WAISTLINE

1405
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:42,767
AND NOT YOUR BUSTED FACE,

1406
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:45,067
HERE'S SOME ADVICE,
FILL UP THE PAXIL,

1407
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,533
BECAUSE LIFE IS GONNA BE
REALLY SAD.

1408
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,067
IF YOU'RE WALKING AROUND
LIKE, "WELL, WHY AM I

1409
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:53,933
NOT A SUPERMODEL YET?",

1410
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,433
WHO ARE YOU EVEN LOOKING AT,
SEABISCUIT?

1411
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,967
"OH, I WANT TO BE A MODEL."

1412
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:04,300
DO YOU WANT ME TO EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU?

1413
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:06,467
LET'S START WITH YOUR JAWLINE.

1414
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:08,500
THAT'S NOT GONNA SELL A LOT
OF MAKEUP IN THE MAGAZINES.

1415
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,067
"BUT I'M SKINNY."

1416
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:12,333
YOU ARE A TROLL.

1417
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,967
MY ADVICE,
HAVE A TWINKIE,

1418
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:16,900
GET REAL GOOD AT MATH,

1419
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,700
BECAUSE LIFE
IS NOT GONNA BE EASY FOR YOU.

1420
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:21,633
I'M SORRY
IF THIS IS YOUR WAKEUP CALL,

1421
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,633
BUT BEING AN UGLY WOMAN
IS LIKE BEING A MAN.

1422
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,400
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK.

1423
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:28,467
YUP.

1424
00:57:28,633 --> 00:57:30,900
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
YOU GUYS.

1425
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:33,867
THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING.

1426
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:36,833
[cheers and applause]

1427
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:03,333
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY I'M OUT HERE RIGHT NOW.

1428
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,667
I WAS HOPING THE SHOW--
IS THIS A LOT OF PRESSURE

1429
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,633
ON YOU, LIKE,
"FUCK, DUDE,

1430
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,633
LIKE, OUR LAUGHS
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TONIGHT"?

1431
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,600
YOU REALLY, REALLY GOT
TO TURN IT UP.

1432
00:58:12,767 --> 00:58:14,600
THERE'S A MICROPHONE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

1433
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:17,067
YOUR NAME HERE.

1434
00:58:17,233 --> 00:58:19,867
YOU'RE IN ROBERT'S SEAT.

1435
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:22,067
WHAT IF YOUR NAME WAS ROBERT?

1436
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,867
YOU'D BE LIKE, "FUCK, THIS PLACE
REALLY TAKES CARE OF US."
