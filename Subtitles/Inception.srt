Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered

26
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,379

vulnerable to theft.

our mind continuously does this

318
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:37,010
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously

319
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:40,586
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening

How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

You never really remember

And adopt his physical presence, study his
mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

625
00:47:32,274 --> 00:47:36,154
So now in the first layer of the dream
I can impersonate Browning.

And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind

Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him

It was Mal's, actually. This

643

This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple

No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout

Why is that so important?

In case one of us brings in
our projections.

We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

No. No, they don't.

I will split up my father's empire

669
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:13,707
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject

670
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:16,678
which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

Can we run with that?

company as a "screw you" to the old man

677

No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

678

We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

679

We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this

01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,434
I trusted him

931
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,511
When? When he promised you
half his share?

932
01:09:45,669 --> 01:09:48,947
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before

933
01:09:49,107 --> 01:09:51,178
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

934
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:54,790
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to, to get to my children

You led us into a war zone
with no way cut?

There is a way cut. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible..

937
01:10:01,221 --> 01:10:03,566
And we get out using the kick
just like before.

Forget it. We go any deeper
we just raise the stakes.

Ten hours of flight time

That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you

We have no other choice but to continue on

She just wouldn't admit it.

She was possessed by an idea.

This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

That she needed to wake up

...that in order to get back home...

[ARTHUR YELLS]

1699
02:14:48,202 --> 02:14:51,877
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1700
02:14:52,941 --> 02:14:54,979
...not just to live for him.

1701
02:14:56,578 --> 02:14:59,117
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1702
02:15:08,894 --> 02:15:10,130
What happened?

1703
02:15:10,596 --> 02:15:12,299
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1704
02:15:12,464 --> 02:15:13,733
No, to find Saito.

1705
02:15:16,003 --> 02:15:17,774
He'll be lost.

1706
02:15:20,309 --> 02:15:22,146
No, he'll be all right.

1707
02:15:38,165 --> 02:15:40,136
SAITO:
Have you come to kill me?

1708
02:15:44,405 --> 02:15:46,877
I'm waiting for someone.

1709
02:15:51,348 --> 02:15:54,120
COBB:
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1710
02:15:56,854 --> 02:15:58,257
Cobb?

1711
02:15:58,990 --> 02:16:00,026
[SCOFFS]

1712
02:16:00,193 --> 02:16:01,963
Impossible.

1713
02:16:02,494 --> 02:16:05,100
We were young men together.

1714
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:09,037
I'm an old man.

1715
02:16:10,271 --> 02:16:12,342
Filled with regret.

1716
02:16:15,478 --> 02:16:18,183
Waiting to die alone.

1717
02:16:21,352 --> 02:16:23,522
I've come back for you.

1718
02:16:26,793 --> 02:16:30,668
To remind you of something.

1719
02:16:33,934 --> 02:16:36,307
Something you once knew.

1720
02:16:39,175 --> 02:16:41,413
That this world is not real.

1721
02:16:46,317 --> 02:16:50,827
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1722
02:16:51,657 --> 02:16:54,428
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1723
02:17:00,535 --> 02:17:01,870
Come back...

1724
02:17:04,406 --> 02:17:07,780
...so we can be
young men together again.

1725
02:17:11,548 --> 02:17:13,518
Come back with me.

1726
02:17:16,621 --> 02:17:18,056
Come back.

1727
02:17:27,801 --> 02:17:29,504
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Hot towel, sir?

1728
02:17:30,138 --> 02:17:33,011
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1729
02:17:33,175 --> 02:17:35,481
Do you need immigration forms?

1730
02:17:37,581 --> 02:17:38,917
Thank you.

1731
02:17:39,383 --> 02:17:41,020
Hot towel, sir?

1732
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:45,025
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1733
02:18:56,415 --> 02:18:57,483
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1734
02:18:58,616 --> 02:19:00,252
Thank you, sir.

1735
02:19:44,307 --> 02:19:45,676
Welcome.

1736
02:19:46,142 --> 02:19:47,545
This way.

1737
02:20:08,737 --> 02:20:12,212
MILES:
James? Phillipa?

1738
02:20:15,946 --> 02:20:17,215
Look who's here.

1739
02:20:22,822 --> 02:20:23,890
Hey.

1740
02:20:24,991 --> 02:20:27,697
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
PHILLIPA: Daddy! Daddy!

1741
02:20:27,861 --> 02:20:30,132
JAMES: Daddy!
COBB: How are you?

1742
02:20:31,232 --> 02:20:32,835
Look what I've been building!

1743
02:20:33,002 --> 02:20:36,708
- What are you building?
JAMES: We're building a house on the cliff!

1744
02:20:36,872 --> 02:20:39,745
COBB: On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1745
02:20:39,910 --> 02:20:42,482
JAMES: Let's go.
PHILLIPA: Come on, Daddy!
