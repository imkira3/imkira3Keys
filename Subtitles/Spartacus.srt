1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,620
In the last century
before the birth...

3
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,370
of the new faith
called Christianity...

4
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,340
which was destined to overthrow
the pagan tyranny of Rome...

5
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,710
and bring about a new society...

6
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,550
the Roman republic stood at the very
centre of the civilized world.

7
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,260
"Of all things fairest."
sang the poet...

8
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,930
"first among cities and
home of the gods is golden Rome."

9
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,770
Yet even at the zenith
of her pride and power...

10
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,150
the Republic lay fatally stricken
with a disease called...

11
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,440
human slavery.

12
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,030
The age of the dictator
was at hand...

13
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,120
waiting in the shadows
for the event to bring it forth.

14
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,280
In that same century...

15
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,080
in the conquered
Greek province of Thrace...

16
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,460
an illiterate slave woman
added to her master's wealth...

17
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,920
by giving birth to a son
whom she named Spartacus.

18
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,380
A proud, rebellious son...

19
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,510
who was sold to living death
in the mines of Libya...

20
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,550
before his thirteenth birthday.

21
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,470
There, under whip
and chain and sun...

22
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,230
he lived out his youth
and his young manhood...

23
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,690
dreaming the death of slavery...

24
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,270
2.000 years
before it finally would die.

25
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,570
Back to work!

26
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,210
Get up, Spartacus,
you Thracian dog!

27
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,580
Come on, get up!

28
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,090
My ankle, my ankle!

29
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,170
My ankle!

30
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,680
Spartacus again?
This time he dies.

31
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,900
Back to work, all of you!

32
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,840
- Welcome, Lentulus Batiatus.
- Welcome, indeed, my dear captain.

33
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,760
Eleven miles
through the disastrous heat...

34
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,760
and the cost
of hiring an escort... ruinous.

35
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,940
Even so, I warrant you have nothing
fit to sell me, have you, Captain?

36
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,730
I've wasted my time and my money.
Tell me the truth.

37
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,940
I think we have a few
you might be interested in.

38
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,820
What, these? Carrion!
The buzzards are late.

39
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,570
This one here's not bad.
He's a Gaul.

40
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,330
I don't like Gauls. Hairy.

41
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,830
- Can he come down from there unassisted?
- Come down, you!

42
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,750
Come down!

43
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,920
Be good enough
to show me the teeth.

44
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,010
- Open your mouth!
- Thank you.

45
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,730
Yes. As the teeth go,
so go the bones.

46
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,310
This mouth is
really impermissible.

47
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,270
- The fellow's made of chalk.
- We have others. Many others!

48
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,160
The sun's over there.
I have to pay these people.

49
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,660
Who's that?

50
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,420
This one's a Thracian.
I'm making an example of him.

51
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,460
- How?
- Starve him to death.

52
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,750
It's the only thing impresses slaves.

53
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,920
What a pity.

54
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,560
He reacts. Good muscle tone.
Can I see his teeth?

55
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,600
Open your mouth, Spartacus!

56
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,230
You smell like a rhinoceros.

57
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,320
Captain, you asked him to open
his mouth. He doesn't obey you?

58
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,490
His teeth are
the best thing about him.

59
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,070
He hamstrung a guard with them
not more than an hour ago.

60
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,660
Hamstrung? How marvellous!
I wish I'd been here.

61
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,500
I'll take him.
Let's look at some of the others.

62
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,050
Come along!

63
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:59,150
In spite of sickness and death,
we will profit 11,000 sesterces!

64
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,450
Including your commission,
of course.

65
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,910
No, sir. Without my commission.

66
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,790
Marcellus, there they are.

67
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,330
They're a dirty-looking lot,
but it's the best I could find.

68
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,090
No one else could have made
so fine a choice.

69
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,890
Slaves...

70
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,180
you have arrived at the gladiatorial
school of Lentulus Batiatus.

71
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,350
Here you will be trained by experts
to fight in pairs to the death.

72
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,310
Obviously, you won't be required
to fight to the death here.

73
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,480
That will only be
after you've been sold...

74
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,650
and then for ladies
and gentlemen of quality...

75
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,280
those who appreciate
a fine kill.

76
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,030
A gladiator's like a stallion:
He must be pampered.

77
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,330
You'll be oiled, bathed...

78
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,460
shaved, massaged,
taught to use your heads.

79
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,300
A good body with a dull brain
is as cheap as life itself!

80
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,460
You'll be given
your ceremonial caudas.

81
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,630
Marcellus, please. There.

82
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,010
Be proud of them.

83
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,760
On certain special occasions,
those of you who please me...

84
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,480
will even be given
the companionship of a young lady.

85
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,230
Approximately half our graduates...

86
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,280
Live for five, ten... ten years.

87
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,650
Some of them
even attain freedom...

88
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,610
and become trainers themselves.

89
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,660
Marcellus.

90
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,370
I congratulate you.
And may fortune smile on most of you.

91
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,500
Marcellus, watch the second
from the right.

92
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,130
He's a Thracian. They were going
to kill him for hamstringing a guard.

93
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,680
- We'll break him of that.
- Don't overdo it. He has quality.

94
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,600
Next.

95
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,780
Next.

96
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,740
I like you.

97
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,080
I want you to be my friend.

98
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,580
I want to be your friend.

99
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,960
All I ask is that
you get along with me.

100
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,300
What's your name, slave?

101
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,050
Spartacus.

102
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,930
I feel you don't like me.

103
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,610
Give him your sword.

104
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,650
Take it!

105
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,460
I have a feeling
you want to kill me.

106
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,670
This is the only chance
you'll ever get.

107
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,630
Kill me!

108
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,300
Don't be afraid, slave.

109
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,590
You have that sword.

110
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,470
I only have this piece of wood!

111
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,890
Are you going to disobey me?

112
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,730
Take his sword.

113
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,110
You're not as stupid
as I thought.

114
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,650
You might even be intelligent.

115
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,120
That's dangerous for slaves.

116
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,280
You just remember...

117
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,910
from now on, everything you do,
I'll be watching.

118
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,280
You did the right thing.

119
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,700
Every once in a while, Marcellus likes
to kill a man as an example.

120
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,540
I think he's picked you.
Better watch him.

121
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,880
- How long have you been here?
- Six months.

122
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,050
I wish he'd pick me.

123
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,380
I want one chance at that pig
before they carry me out!

124
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,890
Quiet! No talking down there.

125
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,810
You'll get us all in trouble,
just like in the mines.

126
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,480
What's your name?

127
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,900
You don't want to know my name.

128
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,610
I don't want to know your name.

129
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,410
Just a friendly question.

130
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,950
Gladiators don't make friends.

131
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,710
If we're ever matched
in the arena together...

132
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,870
I'll have to kill you.

133
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,400
Helena...

134
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,820
with Galino.

135
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,660
Patricia...

136
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,250
Crixus.

137
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,420
Priscilla...

138
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,550
David.

139
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,140
Claudia...

140
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,890
Pharox.

141
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,230
Varinia...

142
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,150
- Dionysius.
- No, no. Spartacus.

143
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,780
Spartacus.

144
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,450
Felicia...

145
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,690
I've never had a woman.

146
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,050
You have one now, Spartacus.
You must take her.

147
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,260
- Go away.
- What will she think of you?

148
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,430
Indeed, what will I think of you?

149
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,640
Go away.

150
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,110
Come, come. Be generous.
We must learn to share our pleasures.

151
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,280
I'm not an animal!

152
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,530
You're not trying to escape,
by any chance?

153
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,330
Direct your courage
to the girl, Spartacus.

154
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,160
I'm not an animal!

155
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,380
- I'm not an animal.
- Neither am I.

156
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,880
What's your name?

157
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,090
Varinia.

158
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,680
You'll have to take her
out of here, Marcellus.

159
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,850
You may not be
an animal, Spartacus...

160
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,470
but this sorry show
gives me very little hope...

161
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,480
that you'll ever be a man.

162
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,790
First rule:

163
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,920
You get an instant kill
on the red.

164
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,590
Here. Here.

165
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,930
Always remember:
Go for the red first...

166
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,970
because if you don't,
your opponent will.

167
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,310
In the blue, you get a cripple.

168
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,180
Here, here...

169
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,190
here and here.

170
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,480
Second rule:

171
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,030
Go for the cripple
before the slow kill.

172
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,190
Here's a slow kill
on the yellow.

173
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,160
Here, here...

174
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,990
and here.

175
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,700
Remember...

176
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,210
A slow kill may have enough left
in him to kill you before he dies.

177
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,370
With a cripple,
you know you've got him...

178
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,290
if you keep your distance
and wear him down.

179
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,420
The rest is all right
for a public spectacle in Rome...

180
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,840
but here at Capua we expect
more than simple butchery...

181
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,010
and we get it.

182
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,270
Spartacus, why are you looking
at that girl?

183
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,350
Varinia! Stand still.

184
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,440
Since all he can do
is look at girls...

185
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,570
all right, slave,
go ahead and look.

186
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,910
I said look!

187
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,580
No. No, this one
goes to the Spaniard.

188
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,340
Have a good night's rest,
Spartacus.

189
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,310
In there.

190
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,480
Woman!

191
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,650
I've warned you
about this kind of thing.

192
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,990
All right, bring them in.

193
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,880
No talking! Move along there.

194
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,990
Did they hurt you?

195
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,250
No.

196
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,340
That's a kill.

197
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,630
One, two...

198
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,630
three, four, five.

199
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,050
One, two, three, four.

200
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,400
We have visitors.
Tremendous visitors!

201
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,740
Two simply enormous Roman lords
on the hill.

202
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,950
How easily impressed
you are, Ramon.

203
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,120
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I suppose they're enormous.

204
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,330
Tell them to wait for me
when they arrive.

205
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,630
- Master, you don't understand!
- How enormous do these Roman lords get?

206
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,710
One of them is
Marcus Licinius Crassus.

207
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,800
What? Wait a minute.

208
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,300
Crassus here? Varinia,
my red toga with the acorns.

209
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,220
And some chairs in the atrium.
Second-best wine.

210
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,220
No, the best,
but small goblets.

211
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,390
Gracchus! You know
how Crassus loathes him.

212
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,350
Take him away.

213
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,940
- I can't lift it.
- Use your imagination! Cover him.

214
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,530
Tell Marcellus
to get the men ready.

215
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,950
Crassus has expensive taste.
He'll want a show of some sort.

216
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,160
Forgive me, Gracchus.

217
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,390
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

218
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,350
most noble radiance...

219
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,770
first general of the Republic...

220
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,570
father and defender of Rome...

221
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,190
honour my house.
Bless it with your presence.

222
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,870
Wine! Sweetmeats! Can't you see
that Their Honours are exhausted?

223
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,550
Have the goodness to sit.

224
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,850
Is anything wrong,
Your Nobility?

225
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,810
No.

226
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,940
Welcome
to the Lady Claudia Maria...

227
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,770
former wife
of Lucius Caius Marius...

228
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,990
whose recent execution
touched us all so deeply.

229
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,070
Honour to the Lady Helena...

230
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,780
daughter of the late
Septimus Optimus Glabrus...

231
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,490
whose fame shall live on forever
in the person of his son...

232
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,750
your brother,
Marcus Publius Glabrus...

233
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,960
hero of the Eastern Wars.

234
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,340
How very much he knows.

235
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,800
Allow me to bring you
up to date.

236
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,640
We're here to celebrate the marriage
of my brother to the Lady Claudia.

237
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,470
A mating of eagles,
Your Sanctity!

238
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,810
Fan His Magnitude. He sweats.

239
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,270
My young friends desire
a private showing of two pairs.

240
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,520
Two pairs. Oh, yes.

241
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,520
I think I have something
that would please them.

242
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:47,650
- Two pairs to the death.
- To the death, Your Ladyship?

243
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,530
Surely you don't think we came
all the way to Capua for gymnastics?

244
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,580
But I beg Your Honours.

245
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,410
Here in Capua we train
the finest gladiators in all Italy.

246
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,580
We can give you a display
of swordsmanship...

247
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,340
which is better than anything
you can see in Rome at any cost.

248
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,260
When they're sold, their new masters
may do with them as they wish...

249
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,720
but here, no, we never fight them
to the death.

250
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,260
Crassus.

251
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,430
Today is an exception.

252
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,560
But the ill feeling it would spread
through the whole school.

253
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,770
And then the cost. The cost!

254
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,940
Name your price.

255
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,700
25,000 sesterces.

256
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,530
Arrange it.

257
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,200
Are you serious, sir?

258
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,330
Arrange it immediately.

259
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,540
Of course, we shall want
to choose them ourselves.

260
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,840
You do have a certain variety,
don't you?

261
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,840
Yes. Inexhaustible.

262
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,640
Spartacus, there's going to be
a fight to the death.

263
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,480
- To the death?
- How do you know?

264
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,890
I heard Marcellus
tell one of his guards.

265
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,110
- Who fights?
- I don't know.

266
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,190
To the death.

267
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,030
What if they matched
you and me?

268
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,040
They won't.

269
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,370
What if they did?

270
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,540
Would you fight?

271
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,960
I'd have to. So would you.

272
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,010
Would you try to kill me?

273
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,760
Yes, I'd kill.

274
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,010
I'd try to save...

275
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,100
I'd try to stay alive
and so would you.

276
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,020
All gladiators
up to the training area.

277
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,690
Some visitors
want to admire you.

278
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,530
Form a line
right here in front of me.

279
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,860
Would Your Excellencies care
to make your selection now?

280
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,530
Claudia.

281
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,630
They're magnificent.

282
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,800
For you, Lady Helena...

283
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,930
may I suggest Praxus?

284
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,850
A veritable tiger.

285
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,350
I don't like him.

286
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,520
- I prefer that one.
- Which one?

287
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,570
David?

288
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,110
Crixus, yes.

289
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,120
Marcellus, Crixus
for the short sword.

290
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,830
Have you ever seen such a pair
of shoulders? Dionysius!

291
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,800
I admit he's small, but he's very
compact and extremely strong.

292
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,760
In fact, he looks...

293
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,640
He looks smaller here
than he does in the actual arena.

294
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,390
Optical.

295
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,180
- Give me that one.
- Galino.

296
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,310
Yes, yes. Galino.

297
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,570
You have a shrewd eye, Your Pulchritude,
if I may permit myself the...

298
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,280
Practically every man in this school
is an expert with a Thracian sword...

299
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,490
but the trident is something
very rare these days.

300
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,830
May I suggest...

301
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,870
the Ethiopian?

302
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,630
There are very few Ethiopians
in the country.

303
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,630
Ethiopians are recognized
as masters of the trident.

304
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,930
I'll take him.

305
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,520
Draba? Oh, no.
For you I want only the best...

306
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,520
I want the most beautiful.

307
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,690
I'll take the big black one.

308
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,190
Very good.

309
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,610
Only one man
in the entire school...

310
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,910
stands a chance with the Thracian knife
against the trident.

311
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,040
There.

312
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,790
- Over there, Lady Helena.
- He's impertinent!

313
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,250
- I'll take him.
- Impertinent, and a coward to boot.

314
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,380
Have him flogged!

315
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,340
Over there, Lady Helena.
The beast of Libya.

316
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,890
I prefer the coward.

317
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,850
If both men are down
and refuse to continue to fight...

318
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,060
your trainer will slit their throats
like chickens.

319
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,690
- We want no tricks.
- Tricks? At the school of Batiatus?

320
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,780
You heard the instruction, Marcellus?
Remember it.

321
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,200
I feel so sorry for the poor things
in all this heat.

322
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,870
Don't put them
in those suffocating tunics.

323
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,540
Let them wear just enough
for modesty.

324
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,040
Whatever they wear, Lady,
they'll bless your name.

325
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,420
Back, the rest of you!

326
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,550
- Our choosing has bored you?
- No.

327
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,760
Most exciting. I tingle.

328
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,930
Do let's get out of the sun.

329
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,770
May I conduct Your Magnificences
to the gallery now?

330
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,200
An eavesdropper. Oh, the god!

331
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,410
How far from Rome must I go
to avoid that cunning face?

332
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,750
Crassus, don't talk about Gracchus.
He's so hateful.

333
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,330
For Gracchus, hatred of the patrician
class is a profession...

334
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,500
and not such a bad one, either.

335
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,840
How else can one become
master of the mob...

336
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,260
and first senator of Rome?

337
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,970
Crassus, it's so boring.

338
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,430
I believe that girl smells
of perfume.

339
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,270
Whatever it is,
she smells most delectable.

340
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,940
You can't keep slaves from stealing
these days unless you chain them.

341
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,110
When a slave's as pretty as she is,
she doesn't have to steal.

342
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,490
An arrangement is made.

343
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,280
If her ankles are good...

344
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,450
you could be sure
an arrangement was made!

345
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,330
- Master!
- Good heavens, a catastrophe!

346
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,670
- I've been anointed!
- You trollop!

347
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,380
- I believe you did that on purpose.
- It was an accident. Come here, girl.

348
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,720
Don't be frightened.

349
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,850
- What country are you from?
- Britannia.

350
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,770
How long have you been a slave?

351
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,270
Since I was thirteen.

352
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,700
You have a certain education.

353
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,910
My first master had me tutored
for his children.

354
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,960
I like her. She has spirit.

355
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,840
- I'll buy her.
- Buy her, Your Magnificence?

356
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,340
I have spent
quite a lot of money on her.

357
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,760
Yes, I've no doubt of it.
Two thousand sesterces.

358
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,140
Two thou...
She'll be waiting at your litter.

359
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,680
No, I don't want her feet
spoilt by walking.

360
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,430
Send her to Rome with your steward
the next time he has to go there.

361
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,600
He leaves tomorrow
and the girl with him.

362
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,860
More wine. And thank your gods!

363
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,480
You provoke me, Crassus.
I shan't be nice to you any more!

364
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:27,700
- Why distress me so much?
- You're horribly rich.

365
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,820
Yet you're the only one
of my brother's friends...

366
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,080
who hasn't given him
a wedding present.

367
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,630
I was saving it
for a more suitable moment.

368
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,790
Here. Give it to him, child.

369
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,760
What is it?

370
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,590
As from this moment, your husband
is commander of the garrison of Rome.

371
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,260
Wonderful!

372
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,600
I don't know how I shall
ever be able to repay you.

373
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,810
Time will solve that mystery.

374
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,230
- The garrison of Rome.
- Yes.

375
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,200
The only power in Rome strong enough
to checkmate Gracchus and his senate.

376
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,370
You are clever!

377
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,090
Open up.

378
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,030
Through that door.

379
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,500
But you will have
to watch him, Claudia.

380
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,090
Father almost disinherited him
because of slave girls.

381
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,840
The marriage contract
absolutely forbids a harem.

382
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,050
What about your litter bearers?

383
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,350
After all, every one of them
is under 20...

384
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,560
and taller than they should be.

385
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,180
She sets rather a high standard
for you, does she?

386
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,980
Your pleasure, Your Highness.

387
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,990
To you, my dear, shall go the honour
of starting this poetic drama.

388
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,320
Open up!

389
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,370
First pair: Crixus and Galino!

390
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,900
Those who are about to die
salute you.

391
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,870
Crixus.

392
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,550
Next pair!

393
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,370
Those who are about to die,
salute you.

394
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,750
Your Thracian's doing well.

395
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,340
How were you able to get my appointment
without Gracchus knowing?

396
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:25,300
I fought fire with oil.
I purchased the senate behind his back.

397
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,850
I still think
the trident's going to win.

398
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,690
- Why doesn't he kill him?
- Kill him.

399
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,360
What's the matter now?

400
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,280
- Kill him!
- Kill him, you imbecile!

401
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,770
He'll hang there till he rots.

402
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,450
Take a last look, Spartacus.

403
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,490
She's going to Rome.
She's been sold.

404
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,790
She's been sold?

405
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,500
No talking
in the kitchen, slave.

406
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,220
There's trouble in the mess hall.
They killed Marcellus and maybe others.

407
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,390
Call out the guard!

408
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,690
Move, move!

409
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:52,480
On second thoughts,
I'll deliver the girl personally.

410
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:55,740
Ride to Capua. Call out the garrison.
I don't trust this lot.

411
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,410
- I hold you responsible.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,830
Around Capua,
they ravaged the countryside...

413
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,290
forcing other slaves to join them.

414
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,920
Looting, robbing,
burning everything...

415
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:08,760
while they make their camp
in the escarpments of Vesuvius.

416
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:12,220
Each day swells their numbers.

417
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,350
The situation presently lies
in the hands...

418
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,520
of this august body.

419
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,730
Where's the mighty Crassus?

420
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,990
- Out of the city.
- At least you're here.

421
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,450
No need to fear for Rome
as long as Glabrus is with us.

422
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:34,370
Let me add: Over 100 estates
have been burned...

423
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:37,420
among them, gentlemen,
my own...

424
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,050
burned to the ground
and three million sesterces lost.

425
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:46,630
I propose the immediate recall
of Pompey and his legions from Spain.

426
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,600
- I could bring them in with 500 men!
- Don't make a fool of yourself.

427
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,810
Why call back the legions...

428
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,440
when the garrison of Rome
has nothing to do...

429
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,480
but to defend us
from sausage makers?

430
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:03,690
Let's send Glabrus
against these scoundrels!

431
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,860
Give 'em a taste of Roman steel.

432
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,910
I protest.
I most strongly protest.

433
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,080
There are more slaves
in Rome than Romans.

434
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,750
With the garrison absent,
what's to prevent them from rising too?

435
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:23,090
I did not say
the whole garrison.

436
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:25,710
Six cohorts will
more than do the job.

437
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,430
The rest can stay in Rome
to save you from your housemaids.

438
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,810
Will you accept
such a charge, Glabrus?

439
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,690
I accept the charge
of the senate...

440
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:44,440
if the senate truly charges me.

441
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,530
The garrison of Rome
stands ready.

442
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:55,990
Slave hunting's a dirty business.

443
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,250
It takes a brave commander
to consent to it.

444
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:00,420
I propose we turn
the city out tomorrow...

445
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,290
in tribute to Glabrus
as he marches through.

446
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,090
And...

447
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,390
for temporary command
of the garrison during his absence...

448
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:15,060
I propose Caius Julius Caesar.

449
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:34,320
You don't look very happy
over the new job.

450
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:37,160
It's not a serious disturbance.
Glabrus will be back.

451
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,620
Maybe.

452
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,790
At least it gives me a chance...

453
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,500
to separate Glabrus
from Crassus for a while.

454
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:49,510
You know, this republic of ours
is something like a rich widow.

455
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:51,800
Most Romans love her
as their mother.

456
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,800
But Crassus dreams of marrying
the old girl, to put it politely.

457
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,140
Hail Glabrus! Hail Glabrus!

458
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:08,780
- God be with you, Glabrus.
- And with you too.

459
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:18,160
I hope he returns
to such applause.

460
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,870
One fat one, Fimbria!

461
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,000
No, keep the change.
Give it to your wife.

462
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:33,090
- May the gods adore you.
- Only through your prayers.

463
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:37,550
Let's make an old-fashioned sacrifice
for Glabrus' success.

464
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,680
I thought you had reservations
about the gods.

465
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:42,060
Privately I believe in none of them.
Neither do you.

466
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,230
Publicly I believe in them all.

467
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,650
Greetings, Marcus Clodius Flavius!

468
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,140
Is Marcus Glabrus in attendance?

469
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,510
- He awaits you in the atrium, sir.
- Excellent.

470
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,690
What have we here?

471
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:27,060
A gift from the governor
of Sicily, sir.

472
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,040
Antoninus.

473
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,080
Sicilian, age 26.

474
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,580
Singer of songs.

475
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:52,170
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

476
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,630
For the children of my master...

477
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,880
whom I also taught
the classics.

478
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,260
Classics, indeed.

479
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:04,350
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?

480
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:07,850
You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.

481
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,980
All of you, come with me.

482
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,160
Are you on guard duty?

483
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,460
My dear Crassus,
congratulate me.

484
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:36,170
Or better still,
let us congratulate each other.

485
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,800
I congratulate us.

486
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,300
Tomorrow I lead six cohorts
of the garrison...

487
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,470
against the slaves on Vesuvius.

488
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,930
The whole city
is turning out to see us off.

489
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,600
Great merciful
bloodstained gods!

490
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,440
Your pardon.

491
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,320
I always address heaven
in moments of triumph.

492
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,240
Did Gracchus have something
to do with this brilliant affair?

493
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,820
Yes, he even proposed it.
Rather decently, too.

494
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:04,660
And you? Do you think I made you
commander of the garrison...

495
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,160
to control some rock patch
on Vesuvius?

496
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,330
It was to control
the streets of Rome!

497
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:14,290
I only take six cohorts.
The rest of the garrison remains.

498
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,800
- Under whose command?
- Under Caesar's.

499
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,630
Excellent, excellent!

500
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,180
Finding Gracchus in control
of the mob and the senate...

501
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:25,890
you felt compelled to hand over
the garrison to him also.

502
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,060
I see.

503
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,770
I'll refuse. I'll withdraw
from the expedition.

504
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,940
One of the disadvantages
of being a patrician...

505
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,650
is that occasionally
you're obliged to act like one.

506
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,900
You pledged the senate to go,
and go you must.

507
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:42,280
If Gracchus should decide
to move against you...

508
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,530
He won't! Has no need to.

509
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:48,370
He has, with your assistance,
immobilized me altogether.

510
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,210
Your legions are still in camp
outside the city walls?

511
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:55,750
My legions?

512
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,380
Do you truly believe I'd order
my legions to enter Rome?

513
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:01,090
I only point out that
you can if you have to.

514
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:03,640
Are you not aware
of Rome's most ancient law...

515
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,930
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions?

516
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:10,850
- Sulla did.
- Sulla? To the infamy of his name!

517
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:13,520
To the utter damnation
of his line!

518
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,820
No, my young friend.

519
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,990
One day I shall cleanse this Rome
which my fathers bequeathed me.

520
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:26,660
I shall restore all the traditions
that made her great.

521
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,580
It follows, then, that I cannot come
to power or even defend myself...

522
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:33,750
by an act which betrays
the most sacred tradition of them all.

523
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:37,590
I shall not bring my legions
within these walls.

524
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,420
I shall not violate Rome...

525
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,760
at the moment
of possessing her.

526
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,350
Go.

527
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,890
Prepare your troops at once.

528
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:56,310
March out of Rome tonight,
but the city tribute is impossible.

529
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,440
We've already been made to look a fool.
Let's not add the trappings of a clown.

530
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:04,610
Leave by unfrequented streets,
without fanfare, without even a drum!

531
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,160
Sneak out.

532
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,700
As you wish.

533
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:14,120
And for heaven's sake,
my young friend...

534
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:17,630
try and see to it that you don't have
to sneak back again.

535
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,500
Farewell.

536
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:47,070
Come on, fat boy!

537
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,910
Noble Romans...

538
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:36,330
fighting each other
like animals!

539
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,750
Your new masters,
betting to see who'll die first.

540
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,330
Drop your swords.

541
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:55,720
I want to see their blood
right over here where Draba died!

542
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:00,180
When I fight matched pairs,
they fight to the death.

543
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,150
I made myself a promise, Crixus.

544
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,310
I swore that
if I ever got out of this place...

545
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,860
I'd die before I'd watch
two men fight to the death again.

546
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,530
Draba made that promise too.

547
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:19,950
He kept it.

548
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,080
So will I.

549
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,250
Go on. Get out!

550
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:33,590
What are we, Crixus?

551
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:36,260
What are we becoming? Romans?

552
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:38,970
Have we learned nothing?
What's happening to us?

553
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:41,640
We look for wine
when we should be hunting bread.

554
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,640
When you've got wine,
you don't need bread!

555
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,900
You can't just be a gang
of drunken raiders.

556
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,820
- What else can we be?
- Gladiators!

557
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,240
An army of gladiators.

558
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,530
There's never been
an army like that.

559
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:00,410
One gladiator's worth
any two Roman soldiers that ever lived.

560
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,830
We beat the Roman guards,
but a Roman army's a different thing.

561
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:05,000
They fight different
than we do too.

562
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:09,000
We can beat anything they send
against us if we really want to.

563
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,880
- It takes a big army for that.
- We'll have a big army.

564
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,010
Once we're on the march...

565
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:16,300
we'll free every slave
in every town and village.

566
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,470
Can anybody get
a bigger army than that?

567
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:20,470
Once we cross the Alps,
we're safe!

568
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:23,930
Nobody can cross the Alps. Every pass
is defended by its own legion.

569
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:26,940
There's only one way
to get out of this country.

570
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,100
The sea.

571
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:31,980
What good is the sea
if you have no ships?

572
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,690
The Cilician pirates have ships.

573
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,240
They're at war with Rome.

574
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,450
Every Roman galley that sails
out of Brundusium pays tribute to them.

575
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,620
They've got the biggest fleet
in the world.

576
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:45,870
I was a galley slave with them. They'll
take you anywhere for enough gold.

577
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:47,830
We haven't got enough gold.

578
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:50,290
Take every Roman we capture
and warm his back a little.

579
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:53,960
- We'll have gold, all right.
- Spartacus is right!

580
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,340
Let's hire these pirates
and march straight to Brundusium!

581
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:48,180
Come join us.
All of you, come join us.

582
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:08,250
Come on and join us!

583
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:35,400
Back to Vesuvius!

584
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,840
Varinia.

585
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,140
I thought
I'd never see you again.

586
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:22,490
Everything's so different.

587
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,660
The last time I saw you...

588
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:35,460
you were waiting
in the arena to...

589
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,970
I thought you were in Rome.

590
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,720
How'd you escape?

591
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,480
I jumped out of the cart...

592
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,690
and Batiatus was so fat...

593
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:12,410
I flew out of the cart...

594
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,160
and Batiatus was so fat...

595
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,380
that he couldn't catch me.

596
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:21,340
He couldn't catch up with me.

597
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:24,130
Do you realize...

598
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:27,260
nobody can ever sell you again?

599
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,430
Nobody can sell you.

600
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:31,760
- Or give you away.
- Or give you away.

601
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:34,020
Nobody can ever make you
stay with anybody.

602
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,020
Nobody can make you
stay with anybody.

603
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,360
I love you, Spartacus.

604
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:48,820
I love you.

605
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:54,540
I still can't believe it.

606
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,580
Forbid me ever to leave you.

607
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:08,550
I do forbid you.

608
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:12,050
I forbid you.

609
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,460
It was funny at the time.
I wish he'd heard it.

610
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:47,840
How good you are to me,
if I may say so.

611
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,470
- You may.
- Thank you.

612
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:52,640
Don't just eye those birds.
Eat them.

613
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,680
There's no need to be
on your best behaviour here.

614
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,350
May I remind you...

615
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:00,520
you've been very good to me
in the past?

616
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,690
I've been good to you?

617
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:08,690
Yes. You've sold me slaves
at an extremely reasonable price.

618
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:12,820
And you arranged private gladiatorial
jousts at cost, or practically.

619
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:15,240
On the whole, you are both
ethical in business matters...

620
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:19,290
and certainly far-sighted socially.

621
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,710
Zenobia's put on a little weight
since I last saw her.

622
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:24,880
- Yes, hasn't she? I like it.
- So do I.

623
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,380
You and I have a tendency
towards corpulence.

624
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:32,220
Corpulence makes a man reasonable,
pleasant and phlegmatic.

625
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:36,680
Have you noticed the nastiest
of tyrants are invariably thin?

626
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:42,390
In spite of your vices, you are
the most generous Roman of our time.

627
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,520
Vices?

628
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,730
The ladies.

629
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:53,360
Ladies!
Since when are they a vice?

630
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:57,280
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

631
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:59,790
I hope I pronounced that word...

632
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:02,870
It's well-known that even your groom
and your butler are women.

633
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,710
I'm the most virtuous man in Rome.

634
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:09,170
I keep these women
out of my respect for Roman morality.

635
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:12,130
That morality, which has made
Rome strong enough to steal...

636
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,380
two-thirds of the world
from its rightful owners...

637
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:17,600
founded on the sanctity
of Roman marriage and family.

638
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,770
I happen to like women.

639
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,230
I have a promiscuous nature...

640
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:24,810
and, unlike these aristocrats,
I will not take a marriage vow...

641
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,110
which I know my nature
will prevent me from keeping.

642
01:18:27,190 --> 01:18:30,730
You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

643
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:32,950
Exactly.

644
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:37,160
It must be tantalizing
to be surrounded by so much purity.

645
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,620
It is.

646
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:47,000
Now, let's mix business with pleasure.
How may I help you?

647
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,840
Great Gracchus,
I find it difficult to hate...

648
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,970
but there's one man I can't think of
without fuming.

649
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:55,930
- Who's that?
- Crassus.

650
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:59,850
- You've grown ambitious in your hatred.
- Do you blame me?

651
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:02,430
There I was, better than
a millionaire in the morning...

652
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,640
and a penniless refugee
by nightfall...

653
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,980
with nothing but these rags
and my poor flesh to call my own.

654
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:10,360
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua...

655
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,780
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs!

656
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:18,030
These two daughters of Venus
had to taunt the gladiators...

657
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,200
force them to fight to the death,
and before I knew what had happened...

658
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:24,540
revolution on my hands!

659
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,710
What revenge have you in mind?

660
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:30,540
I sold Crassus this woman,
Varinia.

661
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:34,460
- Whom?
- Varinia. May the gods give her wings.

662
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,630
There was no contract,
but she was clearly his slave...

663
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,890
as soon as the deal was made.

664
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:42,350
Now she's off with Spartacus
killing people in their beds.

665
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:46,640
And Crassus...
no mention of money, no!

666
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:48,900
You never offered me
this woman. Why not?

667
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:52,820
Well, she's not remotely
your type, Gracchus.

668
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,280
- She is very thin and...
- Look around you.

669
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,450
You'll see women of all sizes.

670
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:03,580
Five hundred sesterces
deposit on Varinia.

671
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:06,290
Since he hasn't paid,
this gives me first call over Crassus...

672
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:08,500
when she's caught and auctioned.

673
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,420
May the gods adore you!

674
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,550
Why would you buy a woman
you've never even seen?

675
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:15,710
To annoy Crassus, of course,
and to help you.

676
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,890
Fetch a stool, Antoninus.

677
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,110
In here with it.

678
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,530
That will do.

679
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,210
Do you steal, Antoninus?

680
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:53,210
No, master.

681
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:55,750
Do you lie?

682
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:58,260
Not if I can avoid it.

683
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:02,970
Have you ever
dishonoured the gods?

684
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:04,930
No, master.

685
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:10,560
Do you refrain from these vices
out of respect for the moral virtues?

686
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,520
Yes, master.

687
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,690
Do you eat oysters?

688
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:20,860
When I have them, master.

689
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:23,660
Do you eat snails?

690
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,120
No, master.

691
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:30,000
Do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral...

692
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,710
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

693
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,750
No, master.

694
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,920
Of course not.

695
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:44,550
It is all a matter
of taste, isn't it?

696
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,510
Yes, master.

697
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:50,430
And taste is not
the same as appetite...

698
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,100
and therefore not a question
of morals, is it?

699
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:02,320
It could be argued so, master.

700
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:08,290
That will do.
My robe, Antoninus.

701
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:26,640
My taste includes...

702
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,430
both snails and oysters.

703
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,490
Antoninus, look.

704
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,530
Across the river.

705
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:47,660
There is something
you must see.

706
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,210
There, boy, is Rome!

707
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:58,920
The might, the majesty...

708
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,050
the terror of Rome.

709
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:08,640
There is the power that bestrides
the known world like a colossus.

710
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:11,970
No man can withstand Rome.

711
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,310
No nation can withstand her.

712
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,900
How much less...

713
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,360
a boy!

714
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,870
There's only one way to deal
with Rome, Antoninus.

715
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,290
You must serve her.

716
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:38,710
You must abase yourself
before her.

717
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:43,170
You must grovel at her feet.

718
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:46,930
You must...

719
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:49,680
Love her.

720
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:55,430
Isn't that so, Antoninus?

721
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:41,080
- Take your time!
- How are they coming?

722
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,580
Good. Give me another thousand like them
and we can march on Rome.

723
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:46,750
Come on, once again.

724
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:04,310
Here on Vesuvius,
we're safe from attack...

725
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,980
while we organize ourselves
into an army.

726
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,860
It may take six months.
It may take a year. We don't know.

727
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:13,320
Once we're strong, we're gonna fight
our way south to the sea.

728
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:16,410
We're going to arrange for ships
with the Cilician pirates.

729
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:19,620
Then the sea will be a road
back home for all of us.

730
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,080
If you agree, you may join us.

731
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:26,080
If you don't agree, go back
before your escape is discovered.

732
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,460
Too many women.

733
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:31,630
What's wrong with women?

734
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,930
Where would you be now,
you lout...

735
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:36,300
if some woman hadn't fought
all the pains of hell...

736
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,470
to get you
into this accursed world?

737
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,640
I can handle a knife
in the dark as well as anyone.

738
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,980
I can cast spells
and brew poisons.

739
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:47,650
I have made the death shrouds
for seven Roman masters in my time.

740
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,690
- You lout! I want to see Spartacus.
- All right, grandmother.

741
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,490
I'm Spartacus. Stay with us.

742
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:57,370
We'll need a million Roman shrouds
before we're through.

743
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,580
Where do you people come from?

744
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:05,460
Most of us come
from the estate of Lillius.

745
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,880
- What kind of work did you do there?
- Sixteen years a carpenter and mason.

746
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,760
Good. We can use carpenters.

747
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:16,010
- What kind of work did you do?
- I was a chief steward.

748
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:19,760
You'll help with the food supplies.
You'll report to the man Patullus.

749
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:21,930
What kind of work did you do?

750
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,850
Singer of songs.

751
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:30,110
Singer of songs?
But what work did you do?

752
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:33,070
That's my work. I also juggle.

753
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:35,740
Juggle. What else do you do?

754
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:38,120
I can do feats of magic.

755
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,580
Magic?

756
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:43,120
Maybe he can make
the Romans disappear.

757
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:15,340
I'll need one volunteer,
man or woman. How about you?

758
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,510
Here we have a likely subject.

759
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:23,140
You'll notice there is
nothing in my hand, true?

760
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:25,310
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.

761
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:27,520
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three!

762
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,690
I make a bowl.

763
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:32,560
My hand is upside down,
and I ask you to blow at it.

764
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:34,820
No, not hard enough. Hard!

765
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:37,820
Thank you.

766
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:46,950
Would you like to try?

767
01:29:50,330 --> 01:29:52,920
Hit it against the rock, gently.

768
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:04,300
Poet, I haven't had
an egg in days.

769
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:06,560
You haven't?

770
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,770
- Here.
- Thank you.

771
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:13,940
I'm not going
to let mine get away.

772
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:37,500
- Sing us a song.
- Sing us a song, Antoninus.

773
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:40,460
Sing, Antoninus.

774
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:46,350
When the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky...

775
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:51,140
when the wind dies away
on the mountain...

776
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:56,900
when the song
of the meadowlark turns still...

777
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,650
when the field locust clicks
no more in the field...

778
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:08,370
and the sea foam sleeps
like a maiden at rest...

779
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:12,330
and twilight touches the shape
of the wandering earth...

780
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:15,170
I turn home.

781
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:18,540
Through blue shadows
and purple woods...

782
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:20,500
I turn home.

783
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,340
I turn to the place
that I was born...

784
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,390
to the mother who bore me
and the father who taught me...

785
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:31,010
Long ago. Long ago...

786
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,310
Long ago.

787
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:38,860
Alone am I now. Lost and alone,
in a far, wide, wandering world.

788
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:43,860
Yet still when
the blazing sun hangs low...

789
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:49,370
when the wind dies away
and the sea foam sleeps...

790
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:53,540
and twilight touches
the wandering earth...

791
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:57,620
I turn home.

792
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:05,130
Where'd you learn that song?

793
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,260
My father taught it to me.

794
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:11,350
I was wrong about you, poet.

795
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:13,560
You won't learn to kill.
You'll teach us songs.

796
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,850
I came here to fight.

797
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,440
Anyone can learn to fight.

798
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,610
I joined to fight!

799
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:29,160
- What's your name?
- Antoninus.

800
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:37,460
There's a time for fighting,
and there's a time for singing.

801
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:39,960
Now you teach us to sing.

802
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,130
Sing, Antoninus.

803
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:52,680
When the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky...

804
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,770
You like him, don't you?

805
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,190
Who wants to fight?

806
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:07,240
An animal can learn to fight.

807
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:13,240
But to sing beautiful things...

808
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:16,450
and make people believe them...

809
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:28,800
What are you thinking about?

810
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:38,390
I'm free.

811
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:42,060
And what do I know?

812
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,610
I don't even know how to read.

813
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,650
You know things
that can't be taught.

814
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:54,490
I know nothing.

815
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:56,910
Nothing!

816
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:01,420
And I want to know.

817
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:03,710
I want to...

818
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,630
I want to know.

819
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,800
Know what?

820
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:16,100
Everything.

821
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:22,940
Why a star falls
and a bird doesn't.

822
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:25,730
Where the sun goes at night.

823
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:28,280
Why the moon changes shape.

824
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,490
I want to know
where the wind comes from.

825
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:46,080
The wind begins in a cave.

826
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:50,920
Far to the north,
a young god sleeps in that cave.

827
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:53,300
He dreams of a girl...

828
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,930
and he sighs...

829
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:59,970
and the night wind
stirs with his breath.

830
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:11,030
I want to know all about you.

831
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,320
Every line...

832
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,240
every curve.

833
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,290
I want to know
every part of you.

834
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,210
Every beat of your heart.

835
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:58,620
Go on about the city
of Metapontum.

836
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:00,990
What garrisons
will we find there?

837
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:05,580
There are two legions in the garrison.
Some have been sent south...

838
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:07,750
Set the litter down there.

839
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:27,770
Where is this slave general?

840
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:33,980
Dionysius, get the litter bearers
out of the rain.

841
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:36,700
Give them food, bread,
and their freedom.

842
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,530
- All right, follow me.
- We'll pay you for them.

843
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:44,490
We have no slaves in this camp.

844
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:51,880
Tigranes Levantus at your service.

845
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:54,550
My credentials.

846
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,090
Come in.

847
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,270
"To the general of the Italian slaves
called Spartacus...

848
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:09,600
from Ibar M'hali, Cilician governor
of the island of Delos."

849
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:11,730
- Sit down.
- "Greetings."

850
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:14,360
Word has been received that you wish
to embark your armies...

851
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:18,610
on the Cilician ships
from the Italian port of Brundusium.

852
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:21,780
- "Receive now my agent, Tigranes..."
- Levantus.

853
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:24,200
"Who bargains in my name.

854
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:28,250
May Isis and Serapis bring victory
to your cause. The governor of Delos."

855
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:31,710
- Who are Isis and Serapis?
- Gods of the east.

856
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:34,750
Why should they want us to win?

857
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:38,340
Because they favour Cilicia...

858
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,510
and Cilicia, like you,
fights against the Romans.

859
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:47,720
Would you like some wine?

860
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:50,890
I drink only after the bargain
has been concluded...

861
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:52,940
never before.

862
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,950
How many ships
do these Cilicians have?

863
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:05,280
Five hundred at least.

864
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:07,490
But no deal is too small,
I assure you.

865
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:09,790
We'll need them all.

866
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:12,750
- All?
- What is the price?

867
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:18,630
Price is 100,000 sesterces
per ship.

868
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:22,300
For 500 ships that would be...

869
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:25,970
50 million sesterces.

870
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:31,640
- You have such a sum?
- We will have.

871
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:37,320
See for yourself.

872
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,030
- Beautiful.
- When will the ships be ready?

873
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:47,200
Beautiful.
I love to see such beauty.

874
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,410
When will the ships be ready?

875
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:52,370
My friend...

876
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:55,080
when will you be ready?

877
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:57,590
How long will it take you...

878
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,420
to cross one-third
the length of Italy...

879
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:04,050
fighting a major battle
in every town?

880
01:39:04,130 --> 01:39:06,600
One year? Two years?

881
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,760
If we're not in Brundusium
seven months from now...

882
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:11,310
we'll never be there.

883
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:15,440
What if we assemble the ships...

884
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:20,860
and there is no longer
a slave army to board them?

885
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:24,490
We'll give you a chest of treasure now,
the rest when we get to Brundusium.

886
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,660
- This one?
- Yes.

887
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:32,410
Done! Seven months from now,
the ships will be assembled.

888
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:37,540
Arrange to have the chest loaded.

889
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:41,460
Now, with your permission, I should
like to have the wine you offered me.

890
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:43,590
- Will you join me?
- I will.

891
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:45,630
Excellent workmanship.

892
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:48,100
It came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman.

893
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:51,220
I've heard that you are
of noble birth yourself.

894
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:53,520
I'm the son
and grandson of slaves.

895
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:57,560
I knew that
when I saw you couldn't read.

896
01:39:57,650 --> 01:40:01,530
Of course, it pleases Roman vanity
to think that you are noble.

897
01:40:01,610 --> 01:40:04,240
They shrink from the idea
of fighting mere slaves...

898
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,450
especially a man like Crassus.

899
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:12,910
- You know him?
- I entertained him one afternoon.

900
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,370
- You?
- In the arena.

901
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:20,420
Excellent wine.

902
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:26,680
- May I ask you something?
- You can ask.

903
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,260
Surely you know
you're going to lose, don't you?

904
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,600
You have no chance.

905
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,270
At this very moment, six cohorts
of the garrison of Rome...

906
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:38,560
are approaching this position.

907
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,320
What are you going to do?

908
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:50,990
We'll decide that
when they get here.

909
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:57,620
Let me put it differently.

910
01:40:57,710 --> 01:41:01,000
If you looked
into a magic crystal...

911
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:05,300
and you saw your army destroyed
and yourself dead...

912
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:08,090
if you saw that in the future...

913
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:10,220
as I'm sure
you're seeing it now...

914
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:12,350
would you continue to fight?

915
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,140
- Yes.
- Knowing that you must lose?

916
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:21,100
Knowing we can.

917
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:24,360
All men lose when they die
and all men die.

918
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,990
But a slave and a free man
lose different things.

919
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:28,950
They both lose life.

920
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:32,870
When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

921
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:36,540
A slave loses his pain.

922
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:40,790
Death is the only freedom
a slave knows.

923
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:42,960
That's why he's not afraid of it.

924
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:46,380
That's why we'll win.

925
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:18,540
Spartacus,
that pirate was right.

926
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:23,330
The garrison of Rome,
they're setting up camp.

927
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:26,800
- How many are there?
- About six cohorts.

928
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,010
- Where?
- At the mouth of the valley...

929
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:32,180
against the cliffs.

930
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:37,600
- Strong camp?
- They have no stockade.

931
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:42,310
No stockade? Are you sure?

932
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:46,400
- I'm very sure.
- This campaign is great sport for them.

933
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,570
The Romans are having a picnic.

934
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:52,530
- Did they see you?
- No! We were hidden.

935
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,740
Maybe we ought to join
this Roman picnic.

936
01:42:57,830 --> 01:42:59,950
Form your men.

937
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:07,500
Six cohorts.

938
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:11,210
A lot of arms and weapons...

939
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:13,380
to build our army with.

940
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:43,620
Crixus always wanted
to march on Rome.

941
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:46,500
Now he doesn't have to.

942
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:49,380
Rome's come to us.

943
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,110
Half this way!
The rest over there.

944
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:22,180
Stand up, the way
a noble Roman should!

945
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:24,350
That's Roman pride for you!

946
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:32,940
That's better.

947
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:35,150
What's your name?

948
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:39,200
Marcus Glabrus.

949
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,950
Commander of the garrison
of Rome!

950
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:45,290
Commander?

951
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:49,410
He was commanding it on his belly
when we found him, playing dead!

952
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,210
You disappoint me,
Marcus Glabrus.

953
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:58,380
Playing dead.

954
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:01,680
You afraid to die?

955
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:05,430
It's easy to die.

956
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,890
Haven't you seen
enough gladiators in the arena...

957
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:10,060
to see how easy it is to die?

958
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:12,520
Of course you have.

959
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:17,230
What are you going to do to me?

960
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:19,400
I don't know.

961
01:46:20,490 --> 01:46:24,780
- What should we do with him?
- Let's have a matched pair, him and me.

962
01:46:26,830 --> 01:46:29,250
I'll not fight like a gladiator!

963
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:36,920
You keep staring at this.

964
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,090
Do you recognize this baton?

965
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:43,800
- Yes!
- You should! It was in your tent.

966
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:48,430
The symbol of the senate.

967
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,980
All the power of Rome!

968
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:54,560
That's the power of Rome!

969
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:00,740
Take that back to your senate.

970
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:04,820
Tell them you and that broken stick is
all that's left of the garrison of Rome!

971
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:07,700
Tell them we want nothing
from Rome.

972
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:10,450
Nothing except our freedom!

973
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:13,460
All we want is to get out
of this damn country!

974
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:15,630
We're marching south
to the sea.

975
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:18,170
And we'll smash every army
they send against us.

976
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:20,670
Put him on a horse!

977
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:23,610
Their leader said
their hatred of Rome was such...

978
01:50:23,690 --> 01:50:26,860
that all they wished
was to escape from her rule.

979
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:30,990
If unopposed, he promised
a peaceful march to the sea.

980
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:34,490
If opposed, he threatens
to ravage the countryside...

981
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:36,870
and destroy every legion
sent against him.

982
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:39,000
And once they get to the sea?

983
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:43,080
They plan to take ship with Cilician
pirates and return to their homes.

984
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:45,790
From which port do they
propose to embark?

985
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,880
I don't know.

986
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:50,720
But city garrisons
can't stand up to them.

987
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,550
If they are to be intercepted,
it's work for the legions!

988
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:57,560
What sort of a man is
this leader of the slaves?

989
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:59,640
I don't know.

990
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:01,940
I think they called him
Spartacus.

991
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:07,360
Is that name familiar to you?

992
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:12,610
Yes, it does seem to be.

993
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,570
I can't place it.

994
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:16,780
After he talked to you,
what happened then?

995
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:21,660
I was tied to a horse
and lashed out of camp.

996
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:26,750
How many of your company
escaped?

997
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:29,090
Fourteen have reported
thus far.

998
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:32,090
I myself was taken prisoner
in my own command tent.

999
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:36,430
The camp was thoroughly infiltrated
before an alarm could be sounded.

1000
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:42,060
Did you surround your camp
with moat and stockade?

1001
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:50,480
No.

1002
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:56,660
We arrived after sunset.
Sentries were posted every ten paces.

1003
01:51:56,740 --> 01:52:00,200
There was no reason to expect
an attack by night.

1004
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:03,580
Then again, well, they...

1005
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:07,540
Continue.

1006
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:12,260
They were only slaves.

1007
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:16,680
I see.

1008
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:23,930
I submit that Publius Marcus Glabrus
has disgraced the arms of Rome.

1009
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:27,810
Let the punishment
of the senate be pronounced.

1010
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:36,200
If we punished every commander
who made a fool of himself...

1011
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:39,320
we wouldn't have anyone left
above the rank of centurion.

1012
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:43,790
But this is a case
of criminal carelessness!

1013
01:52:43,870 --> 01:52:47,210
Six cohorts have been slaughtered.

1014
01:52:47,290 --> 01:52:49,750
Crassus sponsored this young man.

1015
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,960
Let him pronounce sentence.

1016
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:57,510
The punishment is well-known!

1017
01:53:00,390 --> 01:53:02,470
Let Publius Marcus Glabrus
be denied...

1018
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,680
fire, water,
food and shelter...

1019
01:53:04,770 --> 01:53:08,100
for a distance of 400 miles
in all directions from the city of Rome.

1020
01:53:13,110 --> 01:53:15,320
One thing more.

1021
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:19,360
Glabrus is my friend, and I will not
dissociate myself from his disgrace.

1022
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:22,580
I now lay down the command
of my legions...

1023
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:24,660
and retire to private life.

1024
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,220
Good-bye, Crassus.

1025
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:44,850
This is no time for a man of honour
to withdraw from public affairs!

1026
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:47,930
- Shame, shame!
- Sit down.

1027
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:52,110
This sort of heroic
public behaviour is nothing new!

1028
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:54,780
I've seen it before... we all have...
and I know the meaning of it!

1029
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:59,240
- Crassus acted on a point of honour!
- Patrician honour!

1030
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:01,410
No matter how noble
this looks from the outside...

1031
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:03,580
I don't like the colour of it.

1032
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:05,740
Crassus is
the only man in Rome...

1033
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:09,830
who hasn't yielded to
republican corruption, and never will!

1034
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:13,960
I'll take some republican corruption
along with some republican freedom...

1035
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:15,920
but I won't take...

1036
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,510
the dictatorship of Crassus
and no freedom at all!

1037
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:25,060
That's what he's out for...

1038
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:27,220
and that's why he'll be back.

1039
01:58:18,330 --> 01:58:21,460
To the mother that bore me...

1040
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:25,000
to the father that taught me...

1041
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:29,220
to the god...

1042
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:35,260
To the blue woods
and the purple shadows, I...

1043
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:38,810
To blue shadows
and purple woods.

1044
01:58:38,890 --> 01:58:42,730
- Spartacus, you frightened me!
- I'm sorry.

1045
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:47,690
- How long have you been there?
- A little while.

1046
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:50,820
Why didn't you say something?

1047
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:53,030
You seemed so happy.
I didn't want to bother you.

1048
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:55,240
I am happy.

1049
01:58:55,330 --> 01:58:59,410
Spartacus, I've been trying to remember
the song that Antoninus sang.

1050
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:01,870
Is it blue shadows
and purple woods?

1051
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:05,000
Or is it purple woods
and blue shadows, or what is it?

1052
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:07,340
I want to make love to my wife!

1053
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:11,880
Spartacus, put me down. I'm...

1054
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:13,890
I don't care.

1055
01:59:13,970 --> 01:59:16,720
- You've got, you've...
- Yes?

1056
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:20,060
- You have to be gentle with me.
- Why?

1057
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:22,020
Why, darling?

1058
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:25,400
I'm going to have a baby.
Now put me down.

1059
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:29,610
What?

1060
01:59:32,030 --> 01:59:34,360
A baby.

1061
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:40,120
A baby? When?

1062
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:44,210
In the spring.

1063
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:51,420
- How? I mean, how do you know?
- I know.

1064
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:54,680
A baby in the spring.

1065
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:59,470
- I'm gonna have a son.
- But it might be a daughter.

1066
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:01,770
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did.

1067
02:00:01,850 --> 02:00:04,390
You're cold.
Here, get underneath this.

1068
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:07,480
- Did I hurt you?
- No, you didn't.

1069
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:10,570
- I didn't mean to be so rough.
- Why don't you kiss me?

1070
02:00:10,650 --> 02:00:13,450
This is the first time
I was ever going to have a baby.

1071
02:00:18,990 --> 02:00:21,240
A baby.

1072
02:00:21,330 --> 02:00:24,580
I'm just the same
as I ever was, Spartacus.

1073
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:36,720
I won't break.

1074
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:10,380
These slaves have already cost us
a thousand million sesterces.

1075
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:13,380
If now they want to relieve us
of their unwelcome presence...

1076
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:15,550
in the name of all the gods,
let them go!

1077
02:01:15,630 --> 02:01:19,010
Impossible! They've already infected
half of Italy with this uprising.

1078
02:01:19,090 --> 02:01:20,850
If we permit them
to escape now...

1079
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:23,520
this condition will spread
throughout the entire empire.

1080
02:01:30,150 --> 02:01:33,400
The Republic...

1081
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:36,740
is still weak
from 20 years of civil strife.

1082
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:39,740
We're engaged in two wars:

1083
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:43,240
One in Spain
and the other in Asia.

1084
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:47,330
Pirates have cut off
our Egyptian grain supply...

1085
02:01:47,410 --> 02:01:52,170
and Spartacus raids the commerce
of all south Italy.

1086
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:57,050
Half the precincts of Rome
are without bread!

1087
02:01:57,130 --> 02:01:59,930
The city is close to panic.

1088
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:04,260
There are two things
we must do immediately!

1089
02:02:04,350 --> 02:02:08,140
Confirm Caesar as permanent
commander of the garrison...

1090
02:02:12,190 --> 02:02:14,360
and assign two legions...

1091
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:19,780
to intercept and destroy Spartacus
at the city of Metapontum!

1092
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:28,350
If we could only have had
Batiatus in the other pot!

1093
02:03:28,430 --> 02:03:31,980
- Now you're talking!
- Varinia, wonderful meal.

1094
02:03:32,890 --> 02:03:36,610
A small piece of land
with a few goats on it.

1095
02:03:38,230 --> 02:03:40,320
The best wine in the world.

1096
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:44,910
For wine you've got to go to Aquitania.
The sweetest grapes on earth.

1097
02:03:44,990 --> 02:03:48,240
Come to Lidya for wine.
That's the best.

1098
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:52,370
The best wine comes from Greece.
Everybody knows that. Even the Romans!

1099
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:55,130
No, Lidya!

1100
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:58,710
You're all wrong!

1101
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:01,130
The best wine comes from home,
wherever it is.

1102
02:04:01,210 --> 02:04:03,090
I agree with you.

1103
02:04:24,910 --> 02:04:26,780
Gentlemen.

1104
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:30,410
- Are there reports on Metapontum?
- Heralds are crying the news now.

1105
02:04:30,490 --> 02:04:33,750
We lost 19,000 men,
including Commodius and his officers.

1106
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:36,080
Nineteen thousand?

1107
02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:40,420
Have you estates in Metapontum?

1108
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:43,720
No. A son with Commodius.

1109
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:46,930
With your permission, good day.

1110
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:52,850
We take five years
to train a legion.

1111
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:57,190
How can this Spartacus
train an army in seven months?

1112
02:04:57,270 --> 02:05:00,690
There's something wrong,
something very wrong.

1113
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:03,740
- We should have an investigation.
- By all means, an investigation.

1114
02:05:03,820 --> 02:05:08,070
- Where is Spartacus now?
- He's nearing the seaport of Brundusium.

1115
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:10,910
I need a few moments
of the commander's time.

1116
02:05:10,990 --> 02:05:13,080
Will you excuse us?

1117
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:22,960
I hear you've taken a house
in the fourth ward.

1118
02:05:23,210 --> 02:05:25,630
Not a very splendid house either.

1119
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:28,470
And you feasted 11,000 plebeians
in the field of Mars.

1120
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:30,800
It scarcely could've
been called a feast.

1121
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:33,930
For 200 years, your family
and mine have been members...

1122
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:37,230
of the Equestrian Order
and the Patrician Party.

1123
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:40,310
Servants and rulers of Rome.

1124
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,820
Why have you left us
for Gracchus and the mob?

1125
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:45,990
I've left no one,
least of all Rome.

1126
02:05:46,070 --> 02:05:49,870
But this much I've learned
from Gracchus: Rome is the mob.

1127
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:52,080
No!

1128
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:55,790
Rome is an eternal thought
in the mind of God.

1129
02:05:55,870 --> 02:05:57,960
I had no idea
you'd grown religious.

1130
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:00,580
That doesn't matter.

1131
02:06:00,670 --> 02:06:03,130
If there were no gods at all,
I'd revere them.

1132
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:06,510
If there were no Rome,
I'd dream of her...

1133
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:08,680
as I want you to do.

1134
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:12,510
I want you to come back
to your own kind.

1135
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:15,100
I beg you to.

1136
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:18,020
Is it me you want
or is it the garrison?

1137
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:22,690
Both. Tell me frankly.

1138
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:25,610
If you were I, would you
take the field against Spartacus?

1139
02:06:25,690 --> 02:06:27,820
- Of course.
- Why?

1140
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:30,700
We have no other choice
if we're to save Rome.

1141
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:32,450
Caesar!

1142
02:06:32,530 --> 02:06:34,160
Which Rome?

1143
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:36,040
Theirs...

1144
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:38,040
or ours?

1145
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:43,460
You know Gracchus is my friend.

1146
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:47,340
I won't betray him.

1147
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:50,720
Caesar.

1148
02:06:54,180 --> 02:06:56,890
Which is worse: to betray a friend
or to betray Rome herself?

1149
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,180
My dear Crassus,
I face no such choice.

1150
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:02,190
You will,
sooner than you think.

1151
02:07:03,810 --> 02:07:06,610
Good afternoon, Crassus.
I've been looking for you all day.

1152
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:08,570
Your new master.

1153
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:14,570
The senate's been in session all day
over this business of Spartacus.

1154
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:18,450
We've got eight legions to march
against him and no one to lead them.

1155
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:20,660
The minute you offer
the generals command...

1156
02:07:20,750 --> 02:07:23,000
they start wheezing
like winded mules.

1157
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:25,500
I've seen such epidemics before,
haven't you?

1158
02:07:25,590 --> 02:07:27,920
- How's your health?
- Excellent, as you know.

1159
02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:30,590
I take it the senate's now offering
command of the legions to me.

1160
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:33,090
- You've been expecting it.
- I have.

1161
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:35,470
But have you thought how costly
my services might be?

1162
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:37,930
We buy everything else
these days.

1163
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:41,390
No reason why we shouldn't be charged
for patriotism. What's your fee?

1164
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:48,280
My election as first consul,
command of all the legions of Italy...

1165
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:50,940
and the abolition of senatorial
authority over the courts.

1166
02:07:51,860 --> 02:07:53,950
Dictatorship.

1167
02:07:54,870 --> 02:07:56,490
Order.

1168
02:07:58,290 --> 02:08:00,620
- Advise me if my terms are acceptable.
- I can tell you now.

1169
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:03,170
- They're unacceptable.
- Yes, I know.

1170
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:06,670
For the present perhaps, but times
change, and so does the senate.

1171
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:08,840
When that day comes,
I shall be ready.

1172
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:11,170
- Convey my respects to your wife.
- With pleasure.

1173
02:08:14,010 --> 02:08:16,090
He's right, you know.

1174
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:18,810
If something isn't done about Spartacus,
the senate will change.

1175
02:08:18,890 --> 02:08:21,560
And Crassus will move in
and save Rome from the slave army...

1176
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:23,640
by assuming dictatorship.

1177
02:08:26,270 --> 02:08:29,360
But that, like everything else,
depends on which way Spartacus jumps.

1178
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,610
Just now, he's trying
to get out of Italy.

1179
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:34,240
If he succeeds,
the crisis is over...

1180
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:37,370
and Crassus may stay
in retirement indefinitely.

1181
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:40,790
I've arranged for Spartacus
to escape from Italy.

1182
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:42,160
You've done what?

1183
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:45,460
I've made a little deal
with the Cilician pirates.

1184
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:47,630
I've assured them
that we won't interfere...

1185
02:08:47,710 --> 02:08:50,630
if they transport Spartacus
and his slaves out of Italy.

1186
02:08:53,010 --> 02:08:57,430
So now we deal with pirates.
We bargain with criminals!

1187
02:08:57,510 --> 02:09:02,060
Don't you be so stiff-necked about it.
Politics is a practical profession.

1188
02:09:02,140 --> 02:09:06,440
If a criminal has what you want,
you do business with him.

1189
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:45,520
How far are we from Brundusium?

1190
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:48,150
About 20 miles.

1191
02:09:48,230 --> 02:09:52,150
Our army will have to camp here tonight.
They're still about six hours behind us.

1192
02:09:52,230 --> 02:09:56,360
Patullus, ride ahead to Brundusium.
Bring Tigranes here.

1193
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:59,320
Marco, report back to Spartacus.

1194
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:02,330
Tell him we camp tonight
by the sea!

1195
02:10:43,870 --> 02:10:47,910
If all goes well, my estimate is
we can load 150 ships a day.

1196
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,790
That's your job, Dionysius.
Work with the Cilician pirates.

1197
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:54,880
- That oughta keep him busy.
- Saves me finding some place to sleep.

1198
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:57,050
Crixus, keep giving me reports
on Pompey.

1199
02:10:57,130 --> 02:10:59,220
There won't be any surprises.

1200
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:02,300
I still want patrols of
the back country until we board ship.

1201
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:04,260
I'll get them together now.

1202
02:11:04,350 --> 02:11:07,470
Spartacus, the harbour district
in Brundusium has food warehouses...

1203
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:10,190
but not enough to provide
for the whole fleet.

1204
02:11:10,270 --> 02:11:12,190
The countryside's filled with cattle.

1205
02:11:12,270 --> 02:11:14,360
And we've more than enough salt
to preserve them.

1206
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:16,320
I'll handle it.

1207
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:19,900
Find out how many men we have in camp
who were galley slaves or sailors.

1208
02:11:19,990 --> 02:11:21,860
Tigranes Levantus.

1209
02:11:24,830 --> 02:11:26,950
- My dear general.
- Welcome, Tigranes!

1210
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:30,460
No, no. You needn't look
for litter bearers to emancipate.

1211
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:32,420
I rode a horse.

1212
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:36,170
Your gods Isis and Serapis
must've been good to us.

1213
02:11:36,250 --> 02:11:40,170
The balance of the 50 million sesterces
we owe you.

1214
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:43,220
General...

1215
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:46,930
I bear a heavy burden
of evil tidings.

1216
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:51,020
What is it?

1217
02:11:52,770 --> 02:11:56,230
Pompey and his army
has landed in Italy.

1218
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:59,230
At the border of Rhegium
three days ago.

1219
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:01,570
We get complete reports
on their movements.

1220
02:12:01,650 --> 02:12:03,610
But do you also know...

1221
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:05,990
that a Roman fleet carrying
Lucullus and his army...

1222
02:12:06,070 --> 02:12:08,160
arrives tomorrow at Brundusium?

1223
02:12:10,830 --> 02:12:14,000
- Lucullus here?
- You have no ships.

1224
02:12:17,790 --> 02:12:19,920
I saw them in the harbour.

1225
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:25,590
The Cilician fleet,
out of strategic necessity...

1226
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:28,140
has been obliged to withdraw.

1227
02:12:29,310 --> 02:12:32,770
- Withdraw?
- There are no ships at all?

1228
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:45,240
Cilician pirates can destroy
any Roman fleet that ever sailed.

1229
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:47,410
If they run away now,
it's not because they're afraid!

1230
02:12:47,490 --> 02:12:49,580
You better give me
a better reason.

1231
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:51,790
I'm as desolated
as you are, General.

1232
02:12:51,870 --> 02:12:53,960
Stand up. Up!

1233
02:12:55,290 --> 02:12:57,170
On your toes.

1234
02:13:00,670 --> 02:13:04,800
- You'll cut the skin.
- Why did the Cilicians run away?

1235
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:07,050
They were paid.

1236
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:09,220
And who paid them?

1237
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,180
Who?

1238
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:13,140
Crassus.

1239
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:21,230
Crassus won't fight us himself.

1240
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:24,610
The reports say he won't take
the command of an army.

1241
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:28,030
Why would he bribe your pirates
to keep us from escaping?

1242
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:30,830
I don't know. How can I answer
when there is no answer?

1243
02:13:30,910 --> 02:13:33,290
I've been betrayed,
just as you have!

1244
02:13:33,370 --> 02:13:36,290
There is an answer.

1245
02:13:36,370 --> 02:13:38,790
There must be an answer
to everything.

1246
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:42,920
We're five miles
from Brundusium.

1247
02:13:44,510 --> 02:13:47,180
Here's Rhegium.

1248
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:50,180
Pompey's march must have
brought him to about here.

1249
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:53,430
He's four days away,
maybe more.

1250
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:58,060
Lucullus lands
at Brundusium tomorrow.

1251
02:13:58,150 --> 02:14:00,310
If we engage Lucullus...

1252
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:03,610
Pompey will have enough time
to march against our rear.

1253
02:14:04,940 --> 02:14:08,990
If we turn west
to meet Pompey...

1254
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:11,780
Lucullus will march
against our rear.

1255
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:17,540
The only other army
in all of Italy is here!

1256
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:19,250
Rome.

1257
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:22,090
Yes, of course!

1258
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:24,760
Crassus is inviting us
to march on Rome...

1259
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:26,970
so he can take the field
against us.

1260
02:14:27,050 --> 02:14:29,800
You mean Crassus wants us
to march on Rome?

1261
02:14:29,890 --> 02:14:32,470
He's forcing us to. He knows
I won't let myself be trapped...

1262
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:35,600
between two armies
with my back to the sea.

1263
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:38,270
He knows my only other choice
is Rome.

1264
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:42,560
Somewhere on the way, we meet.

1265
02:14:42,650 --> 02:14:45,860
If he beats us,
he becomes the saviour of Rome...

1266
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:48,030
and there's his final victory
over the senate.

1267
02:14:48,110 --> 02:14:53,280
General, allow me
to redeem myself in your eyes.

1268
02:14:53,370 --> 02:14:55,290
For a very small commission...

1269
02:14:55,370 --> 02:14:59,870
I can arrange for you, your family
and your leaders, of course...

1270
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:03,040
to be smuggled out of Italy and
transported to an eastern country...

1271
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:05,880
where men of substance like you
are welcome and appreciated.

1272
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:08,590
You can live there like kings
for the rest of your lives.

1273
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:10,760
What do you think, General?

1274
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:13,600
Go away.

1275
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:16,100
Go away?

1276
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:31,910
Tell the trumpeters
to sound assembly.

1277
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,130
Tonight a Roman army lands
in the harbour of Brundusium.

1278
02:15:45,250 --> 02:15:48,170
Another army is approaching
us from the west.

1279
02:15:48,260 --> 02:15:51,260
Between them,
they hope to trap us here...

1280
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:53,430
against the sea.

1281
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:57,140
The Cilician pirates have betrayed us.
We have no ships.

1282
02:15:57,220 --> 02:16:00,100
"By order of the senate..."

1283
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:03,810
be it known that we have
this day elected...

1284
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:06,650
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

1285
02:16:06,730 --> 02:16:09,610
first consul of the Republic...

1286
02:16:09,690 --> 02:16:14,200
"and commander in chief
of the armies of Rome."

1287
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:17,530
Hail Crassus!

1288
02:16:17,620 --> 02:16:21,660
Rome will not allow us
to escape from Italy.

1289
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:26,420
We have no choice
but to march against Rome herself...

1290
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:30,760
and end this war the only way
it could have ended:

1291
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:34,510
By freeing every slave in Italy.

1292
02:16:34,590 --> 02:16:37,140
I promise you...

1293
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:39,560
a new Rome...

1294
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:41,680
a new Italy and a new empire.

1295
02:16:42,850 --> 02:16:45,400
I promise the destruction
of the slave army...

1296
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:49,150
and the restoration of order...

1297
02:16:49,230 --> 02:16:51,320
throughout all our territories.

1298
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:55,660
I'd rather be here,
a free man among brothers...

1299
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:59,120
facing a long march
and a hard fight...

1300
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:02,580
than to be the richest citizen
of Rome...

1301
02:17:02,660 --> 02:17:05,620
fat with food
he didn't work for...

1302
02:17:05,710 --> 02:17:07,830
and surrounded by slaves.

1303
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:11,420
I promise the living body
of Spartacus...

1304
02:17:11,510 --> 02:17:14,880
for whatever punishment
you may deem fit.

1305
02:17:14,970 --> 02:17:18,350
That or his head.

1306
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:23,770
This I vow by the spirits
of all my forefathers.

1307
02:17:23,850 --> 02:17:26,520
This I have sworn...

1308
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:29,190
in the temple
that guards their bones.

1309
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:33,240
Hail Crassus!

1310
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:36,700
We've travelled
a long ways together.

1311
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:41,490
We've fought many battles
and won great victories.

1312
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:46,160
Now, instead of taking ship
for our homes across the sea...

1313
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:49,250
we must fight again.

1314
02:17:49,330 --> 02:17:52,170
Maybe there's no peace
in this world...

1315
02:17:52,250 --> 02:17:55,550
for us or for anyone else.
I don't know.

1316
02:17:56,630 --> 02:17:58,720
But I do know...

1317
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:01,100
that as long as we live...

1318
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:04,600
we must stay true to ourselves.

1319
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:10,650
I do know that we're brothers,
and I know that we're free.

1320
02:18:17,650 --> 02:18:19,740
We march tonight!

1321
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:56,380
Hail Crassus!

1322
02:19:56,460 --> 02:19:58,550
Greetings to you, Crassus.

1323
02:19:58,630 --> 02:20:00,970
Caius. Gentlemen.

1324
02:20:02,130 --> 02:20:04,220
Have your dispositions
been made?

1325
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:08,770
Each maniple knows its position in line,
sir, and exactly what's expected.

1326
02:20:08,850 --> 02:20:12,730
Every legion commander
has been given his battle orders.

1327
02:20:12,810 --> 02:20:15,520
Excellent. All positions
will now be changed.

1328
02:20:15,610 --> 02:20:17,520
Changed?

1329
02:20:17,610 --> 02:20:20,690
Spartacus takes too keen
an interest in our plans, I fear.

1330
02:20:22,150 --> 02:20:25,450
New battle orders
will be issued in a short while.

1331
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:32,000
Spartacus has every reason to believe
that he has outdistanced...

1332
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:35,790
the pursuing armies
of Pompey and of Lucullus.

1333
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:39,050
However, there are passes
through the Apennine Mountains...

1334
02:20:39,130 --> 02:20:41,420
unknown to any map.

1335
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:47,180
It may fortify
your courage to know...

1336
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:51,480
that Pompey is at this moment encamped
some 20 miles to the west of us...

1337
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:54,350
and that the army of Lucullus
approaches from the south...

1338
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:56,520
by forced night march.

1339
02:20:56,610 --> 02:21:00,780
Sir, allow us to pledge you the most
glorious victory of your career.

1340
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:04,950
I'm not after glory!

1341
02:21:05,860 --> 02:21:07,950
I'm after Spartacus.

1342
02:21:08,990 --> 02:21:11,410
And, gentlemen,
I mean to have him.

1343
02:21:12,910 --> 02:21:17,250
However, this campaign
is not alone to kill Spartacus.

1344
02:21:17,330 --> 02:21:20,420
It is to kill
the legend of Spartacus.

1345
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:24,380
You may go, gentlemen.

1346
02:21:24,470 --> 02:21:26,340
Hail Crassus.

1347
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:31,220
Lentulus Batiatus
awaits Your Excellency.

1348
02:21:31,310 --> 02:21:33,560
- Who?
- The Lanista, sir.

1349
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:37,190
Admit him.

1350
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:41,980
Most Blessed Highness,
as soon as I received your message...

1351
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:44,070
I hurried into your
distinguished presence.

1352
02:21:44,150 --> 02:21:46,910
I'm glad you were able
to spare the time. Sit down.

1353
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:50,030
How gracious.

1354
02:21:50,830 --> 02:21:53,910
I understand... I'm informed...

1355
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,460
that Spartacus once trained
under your auspices.

1356
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:58,630
Yes! In fact...

1357
02:21:58,710 --> 02:22:01,340
if it isn't too subversive
to say so...

1358
02:22:01,420 --> 02:22:04,670
I made him what he is today.

1359
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:07,090
You're to be congratulated
indeed.

1360
02:22:07,180 --> 02:22:11,260
I, too, as it happens, since you're
so admirably qualified to give me...

1361
02:22:11,350 --> 02:22:13,810
what up to now
I've not been able to obtain:

1362
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:16,100
A physical description
of Spartacus.

1363
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:17,270
Yes.

1364
02:22:17,850 --> 02:22:20,020
But you saw him.

1365
02:22:21,730 --> 02:22:23,860
- What?
- In the ring.

1366
02:22:25,190 --> 02:22:27,200
When?

1367
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:30,990
When you visited my school
with those two charming ladies.

1368
02:22:32,530 --> 02:22:34,790
What?

1369
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:37,210
I trust they're both
in good health.

1370
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:40,540
They selected him to fight
against Draba, the Negro.

1371
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:43,670
- I remember the Negro.
- You had good cause to, if I remember...

1372
02:22:43,750 --> 02:22:45,960
If I may say so, Your Excellency.

1373
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:48,430
A brilliant dagger thrust.
Difficult angle.

1374
02:22:48,510 --> 02:22:50,590
- Spartacus was the opponent?
- Yes.

1375
02:22:53,560 --> 02:22:55,930
What did he look like?

1376
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:58,730
That's a matter of some
importance to Your Highness?

1377
02:22:58,810 --> 02:23:03,400
Yes, to every man who loves Rome
and wishes to see her strong.

1378
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:05,570
We're both Roman patriots, sir.

1379
02:23:05,650 --> 02:23:08,070
You're a great one.
I, of course, smaller.

1380
02:23:08,150 --> 02:23:10,700
But we both believe
in Roman fair play.

1381
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:12,820
If you want
something from me...

1382
02:23:12,910 --> 02:23:15,950
I would be lacking
in respect for my own conscience...

1383
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:18,120
if I did not say
that I wish something from you.

1384
02:23:18,210 --> 02:23:20,330
Name your price.

1385
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:22,630
If... no...

1386
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:25,340
when you win
your victory tomorrow...

1387
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:28,130
presumably the survivors
will be auctioned off...

1388
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:31,550
in order to pay for the expenses
of this heroic expedition.

1389
02:23:32,930 --> 02:23:35,760
Could not the agent
for that sale be he...

1390
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:40,060
who shares this tiny moment
of history with Your Honour?

1391
02:23:41,650 --> 02:23:45,610
I authorize you to be the agent
for the sale of all survivors.

1392
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:49,320
In return, you will remain here with us
until after the battle...

1393
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:51,570
and aid me
in identifying Spartacus.

1394
02:23:51,660 --> 02:23:53,530
After the battle?

1395
02:23:53,620 --> 02:23:56,330
You misunderstand me.
I'm a civilian.

1396
02:23:56,410 --> 02:23:59,790
I'm even more of a civilian
than most civilians.

1397
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:02,620
If you wish to remain so...

1398
02:24:02,710 --> 02:24:06,000
I should strongly advise you
to stay here and be our guest.

1399
02:24:06,090 --> 02:24:07,500
Guard!

1400
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:17,930
My dear, all-conquering
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

1401
02:24:18,810 --> 02:24:21,180
what if it is Spartacus
who crosses the battlefield...

1402
02:24:21,270 --> 02:24:23,190
Looking for you?

1403
02:24:25,310 --> 02:24:28,190
In such circumstances,
I have no doubt...

1404
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:30,530
you will be helping him.

1405
02:24:30,610 --> 02:24:33,410
This fellow remains with us
until after the battle.

1406
02:24:33,490 --> 02:24:37,660
Make him comfortable.
Don't let him feel lonely.

1407
02:26:10,670 --> 02:26:13,260
Mommy? Mommy?

1408
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:18,680
When do we go home?

1409
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:25,230
Go to sleep, dear.

1410
02:26:58,630 --> 02:27:00,930
No pains yet?

1411
02:27:01,010 --> 02:27:03,680
He's a bad child, though.
He hits me with his fist.

1412
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:06,060
He wants to see his mother.
Can you blame him?

1413
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:09,100
Can you feel it?

1414
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:12,310
No, I don't.

1415
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:14,820
I hope he waits
till we get to Rome.

1416
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:20,200
Rome!

1417
02:27:21,910 --> 02:27:24,030
They've never beaten us yet.

1418
02:27:26,750 --> 02:27:29,040
No.

1419
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:33,540
But no matter how many times
we beat them...

1420
02:27:33,630 --> 02:27:37,550
they still seem to have
another army to send against us.

1421
02:27:37,630 --> 02:27:39,550
And another.

1422
02:27:42,010 --> 02:27:45,760
Varinia, it just seems
like we've started something...

1423
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,640
that has no ending!

1424
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:52,270
If it ended tomorrow,
it would be worth it.

1425
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:03,740
Varinia, don't make me weak.

1426
02:28:04,410 --> 02:28:07,330
You're strong enough
to be weak.

1427
02:28:12,170 --> 02:28:14,460
I love you more than my life.

1428
02:28:16,710 --> 02:28:20,630
Yet, sometimes, even with you here
sleeping beside me...

1429
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:24,640
I feel so alone.

1430
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:29,600
I imagine a god for slaves...

1431
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:32,390
and I pray.

1432
02:28:32,480 --> 02:28:34,560
What do you pray for?

1433
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:39,190
I pray for a son
who'll be born free.

1434
02:28:40,860 --> 02:28:43,160
I pray for the same thing.

1435
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:50,250
Take care of my son, Varinia.

1436
02:28:51,870 --> 02:28:53,960
If he never knows me...

1437
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:57,710
tell him who I was
and what we dreamed of.

1438
02:28:57,790 --> 02:29:01,210
Tell him the truth. There will be
plenty of others to tell him lies.

1439
02:29:01,300 --> 02:29:03,380
I can't live without you,
Spartacus!

1440
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:19,360
For you and me
there can be no farewells.

1441
02:29:23,860 --> 02:29:26,660
As long as one of us lives...

1442
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:28,830
we all live.

1443
02:29:29,790 --> 02:29:32,750
I felt it! Did you feel it?

1444
02:29:32,830 --> 02:29:35,750
- Yes, I did.
- That was so strong. Does it hurt you?

1445
02:29:36,830 --> 02:29:38,920
That was so strong.

1446
02:36:00,970 --> 02:36:03,470
Lucullus and Pompey.

1447
02:39:41,980 --> 02:39:44,020
Have we a count of prisoners?

1448
02:39:44,110 --> 02:39:46,780
We haven't made
the final count, sir.

1449
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:49,950
I bring a message
from your master...

1450
02:39:50,030 --> 02:39:53,410
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

1451
02:39:53,490 --> 02:39:55,950
commander of Italy.

1452
02:39:56,040 --> 02:39:59,870
By command of
His Most Merciful Excellency...

1453
02:39:59,960 --> 02:40:02,540
your lives are to be spared.

1454
02:40:05,710 --> 02:40:07,630
Slaves you were...

1455
02:40:07,710 --> 02:40:09,800
and slaves you remain.

1456
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:13,300
But the terrible penalty
of crucifixion...

1457
02:40:13,390 --> 02:40:15,470
has been set aside...

1458
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:19,850
on the single condition
that you identify the body...

1459
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:24,730
or the living person
of the slave called Spartacus.

1460
02:40:37,240 --> 02:40:39,960
- I'm Spartacus!
- I'm Spartacus!

1461
02:41:24,830 --> 02:41:27,960
Forgive me for being one of the last
to congratulate you, Your Nobility.

1462
02:41:28,050 --> 02:41:30,880
There's an ugly rumour
going round the camp...

1463
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:33,680
that the prisoners
are to be crucified.

1464
02:41:34,430 --> 02:41:36,300
That is true.

1465
02:41:37,720 --> 02:41:39,810
Perhaps this is the moment
to remind Your Highness...

1466
02:41:39,890 --> 02:41:43,440
that yesterday you promised me I could
be the agent in their auctioning.

1467
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:47,270
Last night you promised
Spartacus to me! Where is he?

1468
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:49,440
In return, I promised you
the sale of the survivors...

1469
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:51,740
and there will be none!

1470
02:42:16,840 --> 02:42:19,260
- It's Varinia.
- Yes, I remember.

1471
02:42:19,350 --> 02:42:21,680
You're the woman of Spartacus?

1472
02:42:21,770 --> 02:42:23,930
I'm his wife.

1473
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:26,100
And this is his child?

1474
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:28,730
Yes.

1475
02:42:29,270 --> 02:42:31,150
Where is Spartacus?

1476
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:37,030
Dead.

1477
02:42:37,610 --> 02:42:39,700
Did you see him killed?

1478
02:42:44,500 --> 02:42:45,830
Yes.

1479
02:42:47,620 --> 02:42:51,250
You're lying. Where is he?

1480
02:42:56,010 --> 02:42:58,300
At least here is someone
worth selling, Your Enormity.

1481
02:42:58,390 --> 02:43:01,260
I'll even take the child
as an investment.

1482
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:05,140
- How many women have been taken?
- Under forty, sir.

1483
02:43:05,230 --> 02:43:08,310
Most of those who weren't killed have
run to the hills with their children.

1484
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:10,690
You may sell all the others,
but not this woman.

1485
02:43:10,770 --> 02:43:12,820
But you haven't seen
the others, Your Magnitude.

1486
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:15,820
They're of surpassing ugliness!
A genius wouldn't be able to sell them!

1487
02:43:15,900 --> 02:43:18,820
Flog that scoundrel out of camp.

1488
02:43:18,910 --> 02:43:22,370
This woman and her child
are to be conveyed to my house in Rome.

1489
02:43:36,590 --> 02:43:38,720
- Halt them!
- Halt!

1490
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:44,680
Antoninus?

1491
02:44:02,370 --> 02:44:03,410
Tribune!

1492
02:44:09,960 --> 02:44:13,290
Slaves are to be crucified
along the roadside...

1493
02:44:13,380 --> 02:44:17,550
the whole distance between here
and the gates of Rome.

1494
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:22,760
Hold this man till the end.

1495
02:44:26,140 --> 02:44:28,020
And that man too.

1496
02:44:35,650 --> 02:44:37,730
- March on.
- March on!

1497
02:45:31,580 --> 02:45:34,290
I've more stripes on my back
than a zebra!

1498
02:45:34,370 --> 02:45:37,210
Every time I touch my wounds...

1499
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:40,800
they sing like larks.

1500
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:43,010
But in spite of that,
I think I've found something...

1501
02:45:43,090 --> 02:45:45,840
- I never had before with all my wealth.
- What is that?

1502
02:45:47,050 --> 02:45:49,970
Don't laugh at me,
but I believe it to be dignity.

1503
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:52,640
In Rome,
dignity shortens life...

1504
02:45:52,730 --> 02:45:55,190
even more surely than disease.

1505
02:45:55,270 --> 02:45:57,730
The gods must be saving you
for some great enterprise.

1506
02:45:58,360 --> 02:46:00,400
You think so?

1507
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:04,910
Anyone who believes I'll turn informer
for nothing is a fool.

1508
02:46:04,990 --> 02:46:07,570
I bore the whip
without complaint.

1509
02:46:07,660 --> 02:46:11,580
Yes, indeed, that sounds
like a bad attack of dignity.

1510
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:14,040
I hope, however,
this will not deflect you...

1511
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:16,460
from the revenge
you were going to take on Crassus.

1512
02:46:16,540 --> 02:46:19,250
No, on the contrary.
It only strengthens my resolve.

1513
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:22,090
I'm glad to learn that.

1514
02:46:24,300 --> 02:46:27,890
This woman Varinia is in his house.
All Rome knows about it.

1515
02:46:27,970 --> 02:46:30,060
Malicious tongues even say...

1516
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:33,310
that he's in love
for the first time in his life.

1517
02:46:37,230 --> 02:46:39,980
I noticed a strange look in his eye
when he first saw her.

1518
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:42,400
It would take a great woman...

1519
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:45,610
to make Crassus
fall out of love with himself.

1520
02:46:45,700 --> 02:46:47,780
I'll be honest with you,
Gracchus.

1521
02:46:47,860 --> 02:46:51,030
She's not as unattractive
as I told you she was.

1522
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:55,080
Dignity and honesty in one afternoon!
I hardly recognize you.

1523
02:46:55,870 --> 02:46:58,580
- But she is an impossible woman.
- Beautiful?

1524
02:46:58,670 --> 02:47:01,000
Beautiful? Well, beautiful.

1525
02:47:01,090 --> 02:47:03,760
The more chains you put on her,
the less like a slave she looks.

1526
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:05,920
- Proud?
- Proud, proud.

1527
02:47:06,010 --> 02:47:08,760
You'd feel that she would surrender
to the right man...

1528
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:11,140
which is irritating.

1529
02:47:11,930 --> 02:47:16,020
I like Crassus.
Let's save him from his agony.

1530
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:18,190
Let's steal this woman.

1531
02:47:19,350 --> 02:47:21,770
Steal the woman? Why?

1532
02:47:21,860 --> 02:47:24,150
I can no longer hurt Crassus
in the senate...

1533
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:27,950
but I can hurt him where
he'll feel it most: in his pride.

1534
02:47:28,030 --> 02:47:30,240
Attack our enemy from within.

1535
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:32,200
The scheme is excellent...

1536
02:47:32,280 --> 02:47:35,370
but I hope you're not suggesting
that I steal the woman!

1537
02:47:35,450 --> 02:47:37,620
Yes.

1538
02:47:37,710 --> 02:47:40,830
Buy some horses
and a cart with a canopy.

1539
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:43,000
Bring her here by nightfall.

1540
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:48,720
Add courage
to your new found virtues.

1541
02:47:50,760 --> 02:47:54,180
Would half a million sesterces
make you brave?

1542
02:47:56,930 --> 02:47:59,060
Half a million?

1543
02:48:02,980 --> 02:48:07,900
Crassus does seem to dwindle
in the mind, but...

1544
02:48:07,990 --> 02:48:10,950
Let's reduce him still further.
A round million!

1545
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:14,240
A million.

1546
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:16,540
For such a sum,
I could bribe Jupiter himself!

1547
02:48:17,620 --> 02:48:19,750
With a lesser sum, I have.

1548
02:48:26,090 --> 02:48:27,920
Forgive the intrusion.

1549
02:48:28,010 --> 02:48:30,680
You know I'm not in the habit
of coming into your house uninvited.

1550
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:32,840
You've always been welcome here...

1551
02:48:32,930 --> 02:48:35,010
as a pupil.

1552
02:48:38,930 --> 02:48:41,600
- You're not alone.
- No.

1553
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:46,320
This time you've come to teach.

1554
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:50,030
You've joined Crassus?

1555
02:48:51,030 --> 02:48:53,370
- Am I arrested?
- No.

1556
02:48:53,450 --> 02:48:56,200
But I must ask you to come with me
to the senate immediately.

1557
02:48:58,500 --> 02:49:00,960
What I do,
I do not for myself...

1558
02:49:01,870 --> 02:49:04,130
but for Rome.

1559
02:49:04,210 --> 02:49:06,960
Poor helpless Rome!

1560
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:11,300
Let's go and hear more
about Rome from Crassus!

1561
02:49:16,350 --> 02:49:18,680
Did you truly believe
500 years of Rome...

1562
02:49:18,770 --> 02:49:22,560
could so easily be delivered
into the clutches of a mob?

1563
02:49:25,980 --> 02:49:29,990
Already the bodies
of 6,000 crucified slaves...

1564
02:49:30,070 --> 02:49:32,400
Line the Appian Way.

1565
02:49:32,490 --> 02:49:35,410
Tomorrow the last of their companions
will fight to the death...

1566
02:49:35,490 --> 02:49:39,540
in the temple of my fathers
as a sacrifice to them.

1567
02:49:39,620 --> 02:49:43,330
As those slaves have died,
so will your rabble...

1568
02:49:43,420 --> 02:49:48,590
if they falter one instant
in loyalty to the new order of affairs.

1569
02:49:48,670 --> 02:49:51,720
The enemies of the state
are known.

1570
02:49:51,800 --> 02:49:55,840
Arrests are in progress.
The prisons begin to fill.

1571
02:49:55,930 --> 02:50:00,470
In every city and province, lists
of the disloyal have been compiled.

1572
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:05,270
Tomorrow they will learn
the cost of their terrible folly...

1573
02:50:06,020 --> 02:50:07,730
their treason.

1574
02:50:09,190 --> 02:50:11,190
Where does my name appear...

1575
02:50:11,280 --> 02:50:14,570
on the list of disloyal enemies
of the state?

1576
02:50:14,660 --> 02:50:16,410
First.

1577
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:22,040
Yet upon you I have
no desire for vengeance.

1578
02:50:22,870 --> 02:50:25,330
Your property
shall not be touched.

1579
02:50:25,420 --> 02:50:29,000
You will retain the rank
and title of Roman senator.

1580
02:50:29,090 --> 02:50:31,170
A house...

1581
02:50:31,250 --> 02:50:35,510
a farmhouse in Picenum
has been provided for your exile.

1582
02:50:35,590 --> 02:50:37,680
You may take your women
with you.

1583
02:50:39,720 --> 02:50:43,730
Why am I to be left
so conspicuously alive?

1584
02:50:43,810 --> 02:50:47,520
Your followers are
deluded enough to trust you.

1585
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:50,650
I intend that you shall speak to them
tomorrow for their own good...

1586
02:50:50,730 --> 02:50:54,110
their peaceful
and profitable future.

1587
02:50:54,190 --> 02:50:56,990
From time to time thereafter,
I may find it useful...

1588
02:50:57,070 --> 02:51:00,200
to bring you back to Rome
to continue your duty to her...

1589
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:03,160
to calm the envious spirit...

1590
02:51:03,250 --> 02:51:05,410
and the troubled mind.

1591
02:51:05,500 --> 02:51:10,840
You will persuade them
to accept destiny and order...

1592
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:13,170
and trust the gods!

1593
02:51:17,430 --> 02:51:19,390
You may go.

1594
02:51:30,190 --> 02:51:32,070
Halt!

1595
02:52:17,990 --> 02:52:21,110
Now, why hide
behind that stola?

1596
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:28,210
That's better.

1597
02:52:28,290 --> 02:52:31,670
That dress took some weeks
of a woman's life.

1598
02:52:31,750 --> 02:52:36,300
You, above all people, should respect
the work of slaves and wear it proudly.

1599
02:52:36,380 --> 02:52:38,260
Come here.

1600
02:52:52,440 --> 02:52:54,520
This belonged to a queen...

1601
02:52:56,020 --> 02:52:58,110
the queen of Persia.

1602
02:52:58,780 --> 02:53:00,860
It's heavy.

1603
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:04,700
In time you will wear it
lightly enough.

1604
02:53:18,170 --> 02:53:20,050
Sit down.

1605
02:53:23,140 --> 02:53:26,390
Will you have
some squab and honey?

1606
02:53:27,850 --> 02:53:29,310
No.

1607
02:53:29,390 --> 02:53:31,480
You'll enjoy it.

1608
02:53:32,730 --> 02:53:34,810
And a piece of melon?

1609
02:53:39,070 --> 02:53:41,150
And some wine, of course.

1610
02:53:43,070 --> 02:53:44,740
Eat.

1611
02:53:50,330 --> 02:53:52,370
I did not command you to eat.

1612
02:53:52,460 --> 02:53:54,540
I invited you.

1613
02:53:56,040 --> 02:53:58,460
You find the richness
of your surroundings...

1614
02:53:58,550 --> 02:54:00,630
makes conversation difficult?

1615
02:54:03,430 --> 02:54:05,510
Why am I here?

1616
02:54:08,810 --> 02:54:11,220
Good question.

1617
02:54:11,310 --> 02:54:14,100
A woman's question.

1618
02:54:14,190 --> 02:54:17,810
I wish the answer could be
as good and straightforward.

1619
02:54:21,900 --> 02:54:25,410
- The infant... it thrives?
- He thrives.

1620
02:54:25,490 --> 02:54:27,740
I purchased a wet nurse
for him yesterday.

1621
02:54:27,820 --> 02:54:30,080
I hope milk agrees with him.

1622
02:54:33,080 --> 02:54:35,460
I sent her away.

1623
02:54:35,540 --> 02:54:38,290
I prefer to nurse
the child myself.

1624
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:41,590
I'm not sure I approve.

1625
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:45,720
It ties you to the old life.

1626
02:54:45,800 --> 02:54:49,390
I want you to begin
to look forward to the new.

1627
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:54,520
I don't care
about my new life here.

1628
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:57,480
You care about the life
of your child, don't you?

1629
02:54:59,190 --> 02:55:02,230
Why do you threaten me
with my baby?

1630
02:55:02,320 --> 02:55:04,950
I belong to you.
You can take me anytime you wish.

1631
02:55:05,530 --> 02:55:08,240
But I don't want to take you.

1632
02:55:09,200 --> 02:55:11,490
I want you to give.

1633
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:15,160
I want your love, Varinia.

1634
02:55:19,380 --> 02:55:21,800
You think by threatening
to kill my child...

1635
02:55:21,880 --> 02:55:23,920
you'll make me love you?

1636
02:55:24,010 --> 02:55:27,340
I did not threaten
to kill your child.

1637
02:55:34,350 --> 02:55:37,440
I'm sorry, Varinia.

1638
02:55:43,730 --> 02:55:46,030
One shouldn't grieve forever.

1639
02:55:47,070 --> 02:55:49,160
I'm not grieving.

1640
02:55:49,240 --> 02:55:51,330
I'm remembering.

1641
02:55:51,410 --> 02:55:53,660
Do I interfere
with your memories?

1642
02:55:54,870 --> 02:55:56,960
No.

1643
02:55:59,080 --> 02:56:01,210
You tread the ridge
between truth and insult...

1644
02:56:01,290 --> 02:56:03,380
with the skill
of a mountain goat!

1645
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:10,800
What do you remember
when you think about Spartacus?

1646
02:56:13,510 --> 02:56:15,770
It doesn't distress you
to talk about him?

1647
02:56:15,850 --> 02:56:16,890
No.

1648
02:56:18,980 --> 02:56:20,900
Well, then...

1649
02:56:22,520 --> 02:56:25,280
what sort of a man was he...

1650
02:56:25,940 --> 02:56:27,610
really?

1651
02:56:31,910 --> 02:56:34,830
He was a man
who began all alone...

1652
02:56:34,910 --> 02:56:37,330
Like an animal.

1653
02:56:37,410 --> 02:56:39,500
Yet on the day he died...

1654
02:56:39,580 --> 02:56:43,090
thousands and thousands
would gladly have died in his place.

1655
02:56:44,750 --> 02:56:47,380
What was he? Was he a god?

1656
02:56:48,970 --> 02:56:51,050
He wasn't a god.

1657
02:56:51,720 --> 02:56:53,930
He was a simple man.

1658
02:56:54,010 --> 02:56:55,930
A slave.

1659
02:56:58,520 --> 02:57:00,390
I loved him.

1660
02:57:01,440 --> 02:57:03,860
He was an outlaw! A murderer!

1661
02:57:03,940 --> 02:57:07,780
An enemy to everything fine
and decent that Rome ever built!

1662
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:11,360
Damn you! You tell me.

1663
02:57:11,450 --> 02:57:13,780
- Why did you love him?
- I can't tell you.

1664
02:57:14,950 --> 02:57:17,410
I can't tell you things
you can never understand.

1665
02:57:19,330 --> 02:57:22,210
But I want to understand.

1666
02:57:22,960 --> 02:57:27,130
Don't you see?
I must understand.

1667
02:57:35,680 --> 02:57:38,100
You're afraid of him,
aren't you?

1668
02:57:42,270 --> 02:57:44,560
That's why you want his wife...

1669
02:57:44,650 --> 02:57:48,610
to soothe your fear
by having something he had.

1670
02:57:50,650 --> 02:57:54,490
When you're so afraid,
nothing can help.

1671
02:57:54,570 --> 02:57:56,450
Nothing.

1672
02:58:04,330 --> 02:58:06,000
We shall see.

1673
02:58:31,280 --> 02:58:33,530
Could we have won, Spartacus?

1674
02:58:35,740 --> 02:58:37,870
Could we ever have won?

1675
02:58:42,330 --> 02:58:45,080
Just by fighting them,
we won something.

1676
02:58:48,500 --> 02:58:51,840
When just one man says,
"No, I won't"...

1677
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:54,050
Rome begins to fear.

1678
02:58:59,050 --> 02:59:01,680
And we were tens of thousands
who said no.

1679
02:59:02,930 --> 02:59:05,730
That was the wonder of it.

1680
02:59:05,810 --> 02:59:09,400
To have seen slaves
lift their heads from the dust...

1681
02:59:11,570 --> 02:59:14,360
to see them rise
from their knees...

1682
02:59:15,070 --> 02:59:17,160
stand tall...

1683
02:59:19,240 --> 02:59:21,370
with a song on their lips...

1684
02:59:23,080 --> 02:59:24,960
to hear them...

1685
02:59:25,960 --> 02:59:29,580
storm through the mountains
shouting...

1686
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:34,720
to hear them sing
along the plains.

1687
02:59:38,260 --> 02:59:40,550
And now they're dead.

1688
02:59:43,100 --> 02:59:44,770
Dead.

1689
02:59:51,110 --> 02:59:52,770
Varinia...

1690
02:59:56,150 --> 02:59:57,820
dead.

1691
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:03,830
And the baby.

1692
03:00:16,590 --> 03:00:18,260
All of them.

1693
03:00:29,270 --> 03:00:31,770
Are you afraid to die,
Spartacus?

1694
03:00:34,730 --> 03:00:37,030
No more than I was to be born.

1695
03:00:48,580 --> 03:00:50,670
Are you afraid?

1696
03:00:53,500 --> 03:00:55,590
Yes.

1697
03:01:07,680 --> 03:01:09,640
Hail Counsel!

1698
03:01:09,730 --> 03:01:12,310
Guards, fall in.

1699
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:15,360
- Where are the gladiators?
- Over there, sir.

1700
03:01:39,800 --> 03:01:44,050
Antoninus, the night passes slowly,
doesn't it?

1701
03:02:02,400 --> 03:02:04,320
You are he...

1702
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:06,870
aren't you?

1703
03:02:09,910 --> 03:02:14,210
Gladiator,
I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus.

1704
03:02:17,340 --> 03:02:22,090
You must answer
when I speak to you.

1705
03:02:44,820 --> 03:02:46,490
Centurion!

1706
03:02:49,370 --> 03:02:53,120
Let them fight now.
Unchain them.

1707
03:02:53,210 --> 03:02:55,540
The entire city's been told
they'll fight tomorrow...

1708
03:02:55,620 --> 03:02:57,630
in the temple of your ancestors.

1709
03:02:57,710 --> 03:03:01,000
They will fight now, for me.
Here!

1710
03:03:01,090 --> 03:03:02,880
And to the death.

1711
03:03:02,970 --> 03:03:04,970
And the victor shall be crucified.

1712
03:03:05,050 --> 03:03:09,390
We will test this myth
of slave brotherhood.

1713
03:03:09,470 --> 03:03:10,850
Unchain them!

1714
03:03:18,520 --> 03:03:20,440
Form a circle.

1715
03:03:36,750 --> 03:03:38,830
Don't give them
the pleasure of a contest.

1716
03:03:38,920 --> 03:03:41,000
Lower your guard.
I'll kill you on the first rush.

1717
03:03:41,090 --> 03:03:44,260
- I won't let them crucify you!
- It's my last order. Obey it!

1718
03:03:44,340 --> 03:03:46,220
Let them begin.

1719
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:25,130
I won't let them crucify you.

1720
03:04:35,850 --> 03:04:38,350
Do you realize how long it takes
to die on the cross?

1721
03:04:38,440 --> 03:04:40,150
I don't care!

1722
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:59,160
Forgive me, Antoninus.

1723
03:05:09,420 --> 03:05:13,640
I love you, Spartacus,
as I loved my own father.

1724
03:05:14,300 --> 03:05:16,470
I love you...

1725
03:05:16,560 --> 03:05:19,140
Like my son
that I'll never see.

1726
03:05:23,480 --> 03:05:25,570
Go to sleep.

1727
03:05:59,390 --> 03:06:01,520
Here's your victory.

1728
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:05,610
He'll come back.

1729
03:06:05,690 --> 03:06:08,320
He'll come back
and he'll be millions!

1730
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:16,330
I wonder what Spartacus
would say...

1731
03:06:16,410 --> 03:06:20,040
if he knew that the woman,
Varinia, and her child...

1732
03:06:20,870 --> 03:06:23,290
are slaves in my household?

1733
03:06:36,140 --> 03:06:37,890
Yes.

1734
03:06:45,810 --> 03:06:47,690
Crucify him!

1735
03:07:06,710 --> 03:07:09,340
I want no grave for him.
No marker.

1736
03:07:09,420 --> 03:07:12,920
His body's to be burnt
and his ashes scattered in secret.

1737
03:07:22,770 --> 03:07:25,140
Did you fear him, Crassus?

1738
03:07:25,230 --> 03:07:27,310
Not when I fought him.

1739
03:07:27,400 --> 03:07:29,400
I knew he could be beaten.

1740
03:07:29,480 --> 03:07:33,360
But now I fear him,
even more than I fear you.

1741
03:07:33,440 --> 03:07:36,450
- Me?
- Yes, my dear Caesar.

1742
03:07:36,530 --> 03:07:38,200
You!

1743
03:07:39,370 --> 03:07:42,450
I don't see the letter here
to the leader of the senate.

1744
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,830
Julia, I don't like
the sound of weeping.

1745
03:07:46,920 --> 03:07:49,540
This is a happy house.
Please stop it.

1746
03:07:50,670 --> 03:07:53,800
There you are. Go away, Julia!
Where have you been all this time?

1747
03:07:53,880 --> 03:07:56,300
The city is full of Crassus' legions.
We've been hiding.

1748
03:07:56,380 --> 03:07:58,970
I don't know Rome
as well as I know Capua.

1749
03:07:59,050 --> 03:08:01,310
They're arresting everyone!

1750
03:08:10,730 --> 03:08:12,730
So this is the woman...

1751
03:08:12,820 --> 03:08:15,070
it took Crassus'
eight Roman legions to conquer!

1752
03:08:15,150 --> 03:08:18,490
I wish I had time to make
your acquaintance, my dear.

1753
03:08:18,570 --> 03:08:22,160
Unfortunately, we all have
to make journeys...

1754
03:08:22,240 --> 03:08:24,330
to different destinations.

1755
03:08:24,410 --> 03:08:28,000
- Where are we going?
- You're going to Aquitania.

1756
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:30,750
The governor's one
of my innumerable cousins.

1757
03:08:30,830 --> 03:08:33,090
Here's a senatorial pass.
It's valid in all the known world.

1758
03:08:33,170 --> 03:08:35,260
Why do I have to go
to Aquitania?

1759
03:08:35,340 --> 03:08:37,420
'Cause I ask you to.

1760
03:08:37,510 --> 03:08:39,930
It's very good of you, Gracchus,
but I'd rather...

1761
03:08:40,010 --> 03:08:43,930
Double the money I promised you.
Here's two million sesterces.

1762
03:08:44,010 --> 03:08:46,390
Two million?

1763
03:08:46,480 --> 03:08:49,480
Here. Articles of Freedom
for the woman.

1764
03:08:50,560 --> 03:08:52,900
And here's a smaller document
that I've prepared...

1765
03:08:52,980 --> 03:08:56,360
for the child
befitting its size.

1766
03:09:01,740 --> 03:09:03,620
Where are you going?

1767
03:09:06,040 --> 03:09:07,910
To Picenum.

1768
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:11,000
Picenum?
That's the dreariest town in Italy.

1769
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:12,960
Will you please leave me?

1770
03:09:14,500 --> 03:09:16,380
Come with us.

1771
03:09:16,460 --> 03:09:18,720
See to it that I don't misuse
the money.

1772
03:09:18,800 --> 03:09:20,930
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm a senator.

1773
03:09:21,010 --> 03:09:24,600
Will you please go
before the soldiers come here?

1774
03:09:32,020 --> 03:09:35,610
This would really make
Crassus jealous.

1775
03:09:36,900 --> 03:09:38,990
Go and make my joy complete.

1776
03:09:39,070 --> 03:09:42,200
Save your tears now.
Save them for the journey.

1777
03:09:52,870 --> 03:09:54,960
Prettier.

1778
03:10:13,770 --> 03:10:15,440
Halt!

1779
03:10:20,280 --> 03:10:22,280
Identify yourselves, please.

1780
03:10:23,860 --> 03:10:27,200
- Lentulus Batiatus.
- Climb down and identify yourselves.

1781
03:10:27,280 --> 03:10:30,160
- I object to that tone.
- I've got my orders.

1782
03:10:30,250 --> 03:10:32,660
Come down
and identify yourselves, please.

1783
03:10:40,710 --> 03:10:44,260
As I told you, I'm Lentulus Batiatus,
the Lanista from Capua.

1784
03:10:44,340 --> 03:10:48,430
This... my sister-in-law.

1785
03:10:51,640 --> 03:10:53,560
Lady, please.

1786
03:10:54,520 --> 03:10:57,230
She's travelling...

1787
03:10:57,310 --> 03:11:01,360
with her child to Aquitania
on a senatorial pass.

1788
03:11:01,440 --> 03:11:04,860
- Take a look through his baggage.
- Not a word, please.

1789
03:11:10,830 --> 03:11:12,750
What did you say?

1790
03:11:55,710 --> 03:11:58,920
- Tell the lady no loitering's allowed.
- Instantly.

1791
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,340
Move on!

1792
03:12:05,220 --> 03:12:07,300
This is your son.

1793
03:12:08,930 --> 03:12:11,050
He's free, Spartacus!

1794
03:12:11,720 --> 03:12:13,600
Free!

1795
03:12:15,730 --> 03:12:17,690
He's free.

1796
03:12:23,030 --> 03:12:25,110
He'll remember you, Spartacus.

1797
03:12:26,110 --> 03:12:28,200
Because I'll tell him.

1798
03:12:29,240 --> 03:12:32,620
I'll tell him who his father was
and what he dreamed of!

1799
03:12:35,870 --> 03:12:39,370
Varinia, have mercy on us.
Get in the wagon.

1800
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:42,630
My love, my life.

1801
03:12:45,210 --> 03:12:47,920
Please die. Die.

1802
03:12:48,010 --> 03:12:51,390
Please, please die, my love.

1803
03:12:51,470 --> 03:12:53,680
Oh, God! Why can't you die?

1804
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:55,720
Come on.

1805
03:13:11,820 --> 03:13:14,830
Good-bye, my love, my life.

1806
03:13:14,910 --> 03:13:16,540
Good-bye, good-bye.

1807
03:13:17,305 --> 03:14:17,342
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
