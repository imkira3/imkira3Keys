1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,877
Oh, great and mighty Rapu...

3
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,965
we pray to you for water and sustenance.

4
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:53,512
I pray to you, not for me,
but for my daughter.

5
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,301
I'm tired.

6
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,552
<i>You have suffered.</i>

7
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,222
<i>Come to me.</i>

8
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,391
<i>Come to me.</i>

9
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,149
<i>You have suffered.</i>

10
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,322
<i>Come to me.</i>

11
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,836
<i>You have suffered.</i>

12
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,212
What do we have here?

13
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,757
Look at it.

14
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,676
It's gobbling up all my fruit.

15
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,472
Rapu.

16
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,269
Bringer of Light.

17
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,687
Oh, it's one of mine.

18
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,525
I am Gorr, the last of your disciples.

19
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,612
We have lost everything, my lord.

20
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,405
The land is dry.

21
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,741
All life is lost.

22
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:05,162
But our faith in you never wavered
and now we await the promise...

23
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,707
of the eternal reward.

24
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,126
Is this why you celebrate?

25
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,506
He thinks there's an eternal reward.

26
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,512
No. No, sorry.

27
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,889
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

28
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,352
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

29
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,563
We just vanquished
the holder of the Necrosword...

30
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,291
<i>- You have suffered.
</i>- ...before he could harm...

31
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,710
- any other gods with that cursed blade.
<i>- If it's revenge you seek.</i>

32
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,111
He threatened to end my entire empire.

33
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,239
But, my lord...

34
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,325
your empire has already ended.

35
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,827
There's no one left to worship you.

36
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,413
There'll be more followers to replace you.

37
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,831
There always are.

38
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,750
We have suffered...

39
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,087
and we have starved.

40
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,883
My daughter died...

41
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,762
- in your name.
- And well you should.

42
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,890
Suffering for your gods is your
only purpose.

43
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,268
There's nothing for you after death.

44
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,811
Except death.

45
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,273
You are no god.

46
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,531
I renounce you.

47
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,749
Now your meaningless life
finally does have a purpose.

48
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,378
To sacrifice yourself to me.

49
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,884
<i>If it's revenge you seek...</i>

50
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,094
<i>...kill all the gods.</i>

51
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,096
<i>Go to Eternity.</i>

52
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,224
<i>If it's revenge you seek...</i>

53
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,394
<i>summon the Bifrost.</i>

54
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,770
<i>Go to Eternity.</i>

55
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,940
<i>- Kill all the gods.
- Summon the Bifrost.</i>

56
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,233
<i>Go to Eternity.</i>

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,612
<i>Kill all the gods. Kill all the gods.
Kill all the gods.</i>

58
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,793
The sword chose you.

59
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,588
You are now cursed!

60
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:20,839
Funny.

61
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,091
It doesn't feel like a curse.

62
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,347
Feels like a promise.

63
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,433
So, this is my vow.

64
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,522
All gods will die.

65
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,319
Come, come, gather round.

66
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,698
And listen to the legend of the
Space Viking.

67
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:33,495
AKA the God of Thunder.
AKA Thor Odinson.

68
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,212
<i>Raised in the way of the warrior...</i>

69
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,798
<i>Thor was taught to help win battles...</i>

70
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,343
<i>fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.</i>

71
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,433
<i>He grew and he grew and he grew.</i>

72
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,352
<i>He was sensitive, like a smile.</i>

73
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,731
<i>And his loving nature did not discriminate.</i>

74
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,901
<i>He once loved a swashbuckling Passionista.</i>

75
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,904
<i>Another time, he loved a Wolf Woman...</i>

76
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,655
<i>on a Woman Wolf.</i>

77
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:15,287
<i>But Thor's one true love was an
Earth woman named Jane Fonda.</i>

78
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,831
<i>Wait. No. Jane Foster.</i>

79
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,460
<i>But sadly, in the battle for love,
Thor lost.</i>

80
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,423
<i>In fact, he lost a lot of people
in those days.</i>

81
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,716
<i>His mum.</i>

82
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,092
<i>His dad.</i>

83
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,551
<i>And that guy.</i>

84
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,678
<i>And that guy.</i>

85
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,971
<i>And whoever that is.</i>

86
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,264
<i>And Heimdall.</i>

87
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,431
<i>And his brother.</i>

88
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,851
<i>And his brother, again.</i>

89
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,061
<i>And again.</i>

90
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,315
<i>Poor Thor had to watch his planet explode.</i>

91
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,235
<i>And then he said, "What have I done?"</i>

92
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:50,239
<i>It seemed that everything
and everyone he loved, he lost.</i>

93
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,283
<i>And so he hid his heart
behind a big, fleshy bod...</i>

94
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,911
<i>so it could never be broken again.</i>

95
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,957
<i>But just because he was done loving,
didn't mean he was done fighting.</i>

96
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,710
<i>He teamed up
with the Guardians of the Galaxy...</i>

97
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,296
<i>and set off on some classic
Thor adventures.</i>

98
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,340
<i>He got in shape.</i>

99
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,300
<i>Putting in the hard yards.</i>

100
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,471
<i>Turning pains into gains,
and never skipping leg day.</i>

101
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,934
<i>He went from Dad Bod to God Bod.</i>

102
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:22,271
<i>But beneath his God Bod,
there was still a Sad Bod...</i>

103
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,564
<i>just trying to get out.</i>

104
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,444
<i>Because all of the bods
that Thor had worn over the years...</i>

105
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,739
<i>couldn't hide the pain
that he was feeling on the inside.</i>

106
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,493
<i>So he gave up his search for love...</i>

107
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,330
<i>accepting that he was only good
for one thing...</i>

108
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,793
<i>Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say...</i>

109
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,505
<i>"Thor, we need your
help to win this battle."</i>

110
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,216
Thor.

111
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,385
We need your help to win this battle.

112
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,720
Let's go.

113
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,930
Okay. Come on, Storm breaker.

114
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,515
Back to work.

115
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,602
We must hurry, okay?

116
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,021
People are dying.

117
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,230
See you down there.

118
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,278
Hurry up!

119
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,999
Give me those.
You're gonna break 'em.

120
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,376
I am Groot!

121
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,170
You got sap all over it.

122
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,634
- Hello, everybody.
- Well, well, look who it is.

123
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,093
How are we doing, guys?

124
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,595
Terrible!

125
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,639
We're all about to die.

126
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,099
You said this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

127
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,144
I said it was going to be,
"Like a relaxing holiday."

128
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,481
But look at that resplendent skyscape.
Three suns of Saturn.

129
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,191
What could be more relaxing than that?

130
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,235
An actual holiday!

131
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,445
Die Booskan scum!

132
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,699
God of Thunder.

133
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,117
King Yakan.

134
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,787
You have finally joined our fight.

135
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,623
Well, as they say,
"Better late than not at all."

136
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,375
Yes, it's very nice.

137
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,586
As you know,
we used to live in a peaceful oasis.

138
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,631
- But then our gods were murdered.
- Murdered?

139
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,843
And now our sacred temple
has been left unguarded...

140
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,762
and Habooska's hordes
took control of its power.

141
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,307
It is our most sacred shrine
and he desecrates it.

142
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,475
Not for long.

143
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,106
King Yakan, tell them
what happened here today.

144
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,567
Tell of the time that Thor...

145
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:36,405
and his ragtag, motley crew
of misfit desperados...

146
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,448
turned the tide of the battle...

147
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,701
and etched their names in history.

148
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:44,079
For the odds may be against us,
but I'll tell you this for free...

149
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,372
Here it comes.

150
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,585
This ends here and now!

151
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,326
He's not going to go into
the temple, is he? No.

152
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,339
Well done, everybody.

153
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,718
We can collectively take credit for that
because we worked as a team.

154
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,346
We used our hearts and our minds
to defeat the enemy...

155
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,140
with minimal loss or damage.

156
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,941
What a classic Thor adventure!

157
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,359
Hurrah!

158
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,384
Good book?

159
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,594
Yeah.

160
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,471
I wrote it.

161
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,058
Wait. You're Dr. Jane Foster?

162
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,392
I am.

163
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,186
- Hi.
- Hi.

164
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,938
How's the Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

165
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,481
It's tough.

166
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,857
- Yeah.
- Really tough.

167
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,776
It's... You need a 3D model.

168
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,402
You ever see <i>Event Horizon?</i>

169
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,612
No.

170
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,240
<i>- Interstellar?
</i>- No.

171
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,206
That movie explains everything
really clearly.

172
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,744
All right. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge...

173
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,498
folds space, so that point A and
point B...

174
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,459
coexist in space and time.

175
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,086
Like that.

176
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,297
You just ruined your own book.

177
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,132
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

178
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:27,886
Watch those movies.

179
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,388
- Okay.
- Okay.

180
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,849
Saw the Hot Cheetos, had to get it.

181
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,066
So, how's it going?

182
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,486
It's going amazing.

183
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,536
Have you told anyone else besides me?

184
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:57,541
When people find out they start
acting weird. They're just different.

185
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,127
I don't need that in my life right now.

186
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,920
Anyway, it's not that serious.

187
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,589
Jane, it's Stage Four.

188
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,924
Out of, like, how many stages?

189
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,676
Four.

190
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,011
That we know about.

191
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,559
Oh, you have somewhere else
you gotta be right now...

192
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,436
that's more important than chemo?

193
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:18,854
No.

194
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,131
You're trying to get back to the lab,
aren't you?

195
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,907
I have a few ideas I'm trying.

196
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,867
Okay, no, time out.

197
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,912
I know you think your lab work is
something you have to do...

198
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,623
otherwise you're letting down
all of civilization...

199
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,960
but you're not getting what the universe
is actually trying to tell you...

200
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,504
so let me translate.

201
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,089
Slow down.

202
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,217
You need your energy to fight this thing.

203
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,845
I'll fight it my way, okay?

204
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,347
Well, FYI...

205
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,184
"my way" does not have to equal
alone in a lab.

206
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,189
Maybe it's time to
play the Space Viking card.

207
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,482
It's not a card.

208
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:04,483
Yes, it is.

209
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,966
- There's no card.
- There's a card.

210
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,487
It's tall, it's blond, and it's gorgeous.

211
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,030
It's a handsome card.

212
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,949
- Jane, are you sure?
- Look, Darcy...

213
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,285
I will figure this out by myself.

214
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,963
<i>Results are still coming back the same.</i>

215
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,464
<i>I'm afraid the chemo has
very little effect.</i>

216
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,219
<i>I'm so sorry, Jane.</i>

217
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,849
<i>If there's anything I can do,
or if you just wanna talk, call me.</i>

218
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,615
Smell like a king, because you're worthy.

219
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,158
Old Spice.

220
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,120
Cut!

221
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,441
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

222
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,026
Home.

223
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,361
Yes, home, Father.

224
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,530
We're here to take you home.

225
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,449
Yes. To planet Asgard.

226
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,993
Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

227
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,746
It is people.
It is you!

228
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:27,584
And now, it is time for me
to pass on to the spirit realm.

229
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,047
I will take my place...

230
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:35,092
in the great banqueting hall
of Valhalla...

231
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,594
the resting place of the gods.

232
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,721
Oh, one more thing.

233
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:41,890
You have a sister.

234
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,812
And so now, I turn into godly stardust...

235
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,022
and say farewell.

236
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,691
Oh, look.

237
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,193
Do you see? It's happening.

238
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,612
I'm disappearing.

239
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,618
No!

240
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,828
Father!

241
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,415
But wait! Brother!

242
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,086
An ominous portal hath appeared behind us.

243
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,754
Transform!

244
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:25,267
I am Hela, Goddess of Death.

245
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:30,397
Now, I return to Asgard to stake my claim
as the rightful heir to the throne...

246
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,316
and no one will stop me!

247
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,483
Join me or die!

248
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,944
We will never join you, witch!
Mjolnir!

249
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,117
Impossible!

250
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,495
I broke your hammer!

251
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,080
Time to die!

252
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,540
Bifrost!

253
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,846
You can almost feel the power...

254
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,807
of these magnificent and immovable stones.

255
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,685
Okay. Let's head back to the village...

256
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,772
where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

257
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,524
Come on.

258
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,060
God of Disaster...

259
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,479
we thank you.

260
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:56,358
We feared we would be at war forever
without the protection of our gods...

261
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,528
but now, peace shall reign.

262
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,490
In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

263
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:09,538
As is tradition, the protectors of our
world are bestowed with great beasts.

264
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,082
Giant goats!

265
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,252
Look at those! They are wonderful.

266
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,213
Korg, look at that.
Those things are beautiful.

267
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,632
King Yakan, thank you so much.

268
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,551
Listen, about the temple...

269
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:24,028
I don't wanna talk about the temple.

270
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,905
I know, but if we were to talk about it,
I think it's important...

271
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,490
- It's making me sad.
- ...to life and material objects...

272
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,954
- And mad.
- Okay, I'll stop talking.

273
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:30,642
Don't forget the goats.

274
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,103
Which you accepted,
and now must take with you.

275
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,396
No backsies.

276
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,483
- They are beautiful.
- Yes, they are beautiful.

277
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,944
They also scream quite a lot.

278
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,111
They'll be fine.

279
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:43,989
I am Groot.

280
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,956
We need to find the damn remote
so we can download the distress signal!

281
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,037
Retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

282
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,521
One of your goats probably ate it!

283
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,473
Goats didn't eat the remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

284
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,975
Well, I ain't digging through their crap.

285
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,627
I love them!
They should live with us forever!

286
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:57,920
Found the remote!

287
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,129
I'm putting them down.

288
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:00,356
- Me too.
- Is it working or not?

289
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,900
No, it's not workin'. It's not charged.

290
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,651
- Well, maybe you need to find a charger...
- Get out of my way!

291
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,235
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

292
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,805
- Korg, you okay?
- Yeah, bro. All good.

293
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,475
All right. Everybody, just relax.
The goats are gonna be fine.

294
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,227
If not, we can just use them
for meat...

295
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,063
...ting people.

296
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,310
Meeting people.
They're a great conversation starter.

297
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,835
And I've been told you can summon them
with a special whistle...

298
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,139
that goes something like this...

299
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,154
No, that's not it.
No, that's not it.

300
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,822
No, that's not it.
You have a go.

301
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:27,366
No, that's not it.

302
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,201
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Kraglin!

303
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,368
No, that's not it.

304
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,223
- You been here this whole time?
- Yeah, you said to stay with the ship.

305
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:35,207
This is Glenda. We're married.

306
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,251
I am Groot.

307
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,003
What did we tell you
about jumpin' into new relationships?

308
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,421
That I shouldn't be doing that.

309
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,174
Yeah, you can't get married
on every single planet we land on.

310
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,801
I am Groot.

311
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:47,803
Finally!

312
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,763
All right, here we go. Distress calls.

313
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:53,141
<i>Please help us!
The God Butcher has found us!</i>

314
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,434
God Butcher?

315
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,228
<i>He left them hanging as a warning.</i>

316
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:58,188
Look at all of these gods, murdered.

317
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:01,942
<i>Our greatest champions,
now laid to waste.</i>

318
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,277
The horror.

319
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,043
Who could have done something like this?

320
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:06,947
<i>Thor, where are you?</i>

321
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,754
Wait, wait, wait. What was that? Go back.

322
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,201
Play that one.

323
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,204
<i>- Thor, where are you?
</i>- Sif?

324
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,664
<i>We need you here.</i>

325
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,053
My friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

326
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,710
Start the ship, my friends.

327
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:21,879
I don't know,
maybe we should split up.

328
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:25,048
So many people to save,
I mean, look at all of these distress...

329
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:26,633
calls.

330
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,013
Thor.

331
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,514
You gonna be okay?

332
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,392
I admire your commitment to each other.
It's a beautiful thing.

333
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,269
Alas, it's something I'll never have.

334
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:38,812
Buddy, if I may...

335
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:40,397
You may.

336
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,100
After thousands of years of living, you
don't seem to know who the hell you are.

337
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,904
I've been lost before.

338
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,615
But then I found meaning, I found love.

339
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,910
And yeah, it got taken from me,
and god, that hurts.

340
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:57,748
But that shitty feeling
is better than feeling empty.

341
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:02,878
My hope for you is that
one day you will find something...

342
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,547
to make you feel this shitty.

343
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,425
I have loved before. It didn't work out.

344
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:12,346
They either die a grismal death
or they dump you with a handwritten letter.

345
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:15,766
I don't know which is worse, but it's why
I keep everyone at arm's length.

346
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,997
You've grown too attached.
Damn it, I knew this would happen.

347
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,898
You must go. I'll find Sif.

348
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,360
You answer the other calls.
The galaxy needs its Guardians.

349
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,904
- Cool, yeah. We were just leaving...
- I know it hurts.

350
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,911
But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

351
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,408
To ease the pain, why don't you...

352
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,912
take this ship here
as a parting farewell gift?

353
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:38,872
You're giving me my ship?

354
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,374
Yes, she's yours.

355
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:43,210
May you make as many memories with her
as I have.

356
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:44,878
She's a temperamental old lass.

357
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,339
Will serve you well in a tight pickle.

358
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:48,775
- I'll start the ship.
- Thank you.

359
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,092
Goodbye, old friend.

360
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,011
A human handshake...

361
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,972
to the Asgardian shake.

362
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,683
Into the snake that you cannot trust.

363
00:25:58,767 --> 00:25:59,994
You're really dragging this out.

364
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,855
And finish with the classic
Asgardian high one.

365
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:07,943
Let's go.

366
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,320
Take care of my crew.
This is gonna be hard for them.

367
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:11,488
Hurry up!

368
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:12,656
Not her.

369
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,157
Remember what I told you.

370
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:16,577
You ever feel lost...

371
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,705
just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

372
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,124
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

373
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,504
All right. Bye.

374
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,677
For what it's worth,
let's cling to the good memories.

375
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:37,973
We Asgardians say, "May you travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

376
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:41,560
"I'll see you in Valhalla
where we shall drink mead and..."

377
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,731
- They're gone.
- Alone again. Just me and you.

378
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,065
Storm breaker!

379
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,027
Watch out, you frickin' crazy axe!

380
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:54,865
So what do we do now, bro?

381
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,408
Let's go get Sif!

382
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,717
Who or what is that?

383
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,012
Falligar, God of the Falligarians.

384
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,515
One of the nicest gods you'll ever meet.

385
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,267
Oh, no.

386
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,986
Sif, it's me, Thor.

387
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,571
Odinson?

388
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,156
You're missing an arm.

389
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,491
I'm gonna get you home.

390
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,576
No! Leave me here.

391
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,703
I want to die a warrior's death.

392
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,914
On the battlefield. In battle.

393
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,959
And then I can claim my place in Valhalla.

394
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:49,419
Oh, I hate to break it to you...

395
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:52,589
but for a warrior to get into Valhalla,
you have to die in the battle.

396
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:55,300
- You survived.
- Oh, shit.

397
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,678
Maybe your arm is in Valhalla.

398
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,556
What happened here?

399
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,641
I've been hunting a madman.

400
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,893
I followed him here, but it was a trap.

401
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,061
Who is this madman?

402
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:08,856
The God Butcher is coming.

403
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,358
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

404
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,277
Asgard is next.

405
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:04,805
Look, it's Thor!

406
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,932
- Thor!
- Take Sif to the infirmary.

407
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,100
Hey!

408
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,393
Who'd you piss off now?

409
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,204
This is not my fault.
I've never even seen these things...

410
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:12,062
whatever the hell they are.

411
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,397
Welcome back.

412
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,007
Who's the new guy?

413
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,885
That guy? You're gonna love that guy.

414
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,610
Mjolnir! Mjolnir!

415
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:00,819
It's me, Thor.

416
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:02,237
Have you seen my hammer?

417
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:03,822
Mjolnir, here, boy.

418
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,326
Mjolnir?

419
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:12,664
Mjolnir.

420
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,880
You're back!

421
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,550
Mjolnir!

422
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:53,371
Excuse me.

423
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,290
Hello. That's my hammer you've got there.

424
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,126
And that's my look.

425
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:06,885
Hey!

426
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:10,389
Enough tomfoolery.

427
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,724
Why don't you take off that mask
and reveal yourself?

428
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:13,892
Come on.

429
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:16,812
Hey.

430
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,605
Jane?

431
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,197
<i>Let me tell you the
legend of Thor and Jane.</i>

432
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:32,911
<i>He was a God of Thunder
and she, a woman of science.</i>

433
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:36,582
<i>And although
they were from different worlds...</i>

434
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,043
<i>somehow, it just made sense.</i>

435
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,882
<i>And together they embarked
on a journey of love.</i>

436
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,931
<i>Thor taught Jane the way of the warrior...</i>

437
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:58,103
<i>And Jane taught Thor the way of the people.</i>

438
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:03,650
<i>And as time passed,
their love grew deeper and deeper.</i>

439
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,780
She's incredible, isn't she, Mjolnir?

440
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,745
I need you to promise me
you'll always protect her.

441
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:18,373
I love you too, buddy.

442
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:23,545
<i>And love that deep
has a way of becoming magical.</i>

443
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,343
<i>Thor set his sights toward a future...</i>

444
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,553
<i>and all it might hold.</i>

445
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:39,978
<i>But the more he pondered a life with Jane,
the more he feared losing that life.</i>

446
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,814
<i>And although Jane
didn't want to admit it...</i>

447
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,317
<i>she was scared of loss as well.</i>

448
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,073
<i>And so, they built walls between them.</i>

449
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:53,992
<i>Thor got busy saving humanity.</i>

450
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:55,786
Heimdall!

451
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,456
<i>And Jane got busy doing the same.</i>

452
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,750
<i>Real busy.</i>

453
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:06,964
<i>And eventually, the space between them grew
and grew until it became too wide to bear.</i>

454
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,263
<i>Something had to give.</i>

455
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,016
I have to stay up all night
to go through this data. Okay?

456
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:20,369
And I have to stay up all night
and clean all of this up.

457
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,563
- There's two plates!
- It's two plates and two forks!

458
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,944
<i>And then, one night, it did give.</i>

459
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,155
<i>Jane wrote a note.</i>

460
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,409
<i>And Thor read that note.</i>

461
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,830
<i>And their legend suddenly became myth.</i>

462
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,292
<i>Or so they thought.</i>

463
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:47,880
You okay?

464
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,882
Yeah, it's a little hot in...

465
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,010
Startin' to feel...

466
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,054
It's claustrophobic with the helmet.

467
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,351
How?

468
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,731
Can we talk about this later?

469
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,274
Yeah, sure.

470
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,650
Great seeing you.

471
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,528
What?

472
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,162
<i>Kill all the gods.</i>

473
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:00,619
Hey. Is that the Necrosword?

474
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,080
That's cool.
I've only ever read about it in stories.

475
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:06,166
Then you know this is going to hurt.

476
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:07,918
Pain.

477
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:10,462
What is pain but a construct
invented by the weak?

478
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:11,880
Okay, that's very sharp!

479
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,182
Ready?

480
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,103
Don't touch my things.

481
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:54,464
Yeah, you better run, you coward.

482
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:16,445
The children. They're taking the children!

483
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,404
Mommy!

484
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,450
Mom!

485
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:47,684
Shadow monsters. Disgusting.

486
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,607
Flew around the world twice.
Nothing.

487
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:56,151
Cowards must have run away.
We'll find them.

488
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,532
- Quite a reunion, huh?
- You're telling me.

489
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,534
What's it been?
Like, three, four years?

490
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:05,994
Eight years, seven months, and six days.

491
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:07,371
I haven't forgotten...

492
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:10,207
the last time I saw you, or didn't see you,
because you left.

493
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,627
It's kind of an oversimplification
to say that I left.

494
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,921
No, you left.
You did.

495
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:17,923
You wrote me a beautiful
handwritten letter.

496
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,258
I should know, I was there.

497
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,761
- You weren't there, actually, hence the note.
- I was.

498
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:28,100
And if you weren't there to see me leave,
then maybe it was you that left.

499
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,435
Fair point.

500
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:32,604
Not that it matters.

501
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,611
- Like, who's keeping track, right?
- No, yeah.

502
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,067
I suppose we both left and both got left.

503
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:38,819
Now you're leaving again.

504
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:43,240
Miek, we need detailed accounts
from all the witnesses.

505
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:45,927
Darryl, get me all the names of
the children who have been lost.

506
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,763
Your Majesty, my daughter has been taken,
and I don't know where she is.

507
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,289
And she'll be found.

508
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:53,208
Guys, they're bleeding.
Get them to the infirmary. Now!

509
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,376
Darryl!

510
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:58,338
Majesty, should we start working
on a performance of this entire debacle?

511
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,007
The people need entertainment.

512
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:01,884
Particularly now, in times of crisis.

513
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,510
Particularly.

514
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:06,805
I did not hear a, "No."

515
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,473
Nor did I.

516
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,766
- Asgard. Night.
- Yes!

517
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,293
We open on some sleeping children.

518
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,441
So, that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

519
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,151
The old ex-girlfriend.

520
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:20,360
Jodie Foster.

521
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:21,527
Jane Foster.

522
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,905
The one that got away.

523
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,573
The one that got away.

524
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,741
That means escaped.

525
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:27,492
Yeah. Yeah... Yeah.

526
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:30,162
Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend...

527
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,956
and your ex-hammer hangin' out,
and getting on so well.

528
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:38,420
What you up to, bro?

529
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:40,464
Come on.

530
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,299
Come to daddy.

531
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:45,302
Come on. Mjolnir.

532
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,348
Hey! There you are.

533
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:50,807
Hey.

534
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,077
- Do you know what I think we should do?
- I was just calling you.

535
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,604
- Start an army!
- With what? Half our soldiers are dead!

536
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,272
Half our soldiers are always dead!

537
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:59,000
- Everyone, please...
- Where are the children?

538
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:00,752
...go home.
I promise you we'll have news soon.

539
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,336
Someone needs to tell us what happened.

540
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,779
We shall find them.

541
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,217
- I just don't understand.
- You know what?

542
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,450
This is all our fault.

543
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,660
Stop it!

544
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:10,953
Asgard!

545
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,798
My friends, we must not quarrel.

546
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:26,218
In times like this, we need to unite,
come together.

547
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,804
I see what's happening here.

548
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:30,806
You're afraid.

549
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:33,350
Scared.

550
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:35,686
Afraid.

551
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:36,979
Anxious.

552
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:42,651
If we are to find the children,
we must first look within ourselves.

553
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:47,489
I'm sorry. Miek, it's very hard
to give a rousing speech with the... noise.

554
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:49,133
- What are you doing?
- She's taking minutes.

555
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,534
Precious minutes we don't have.

556
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:52,702
You want the kids back?

557
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:55,372
I'll be back in a minute.

558
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:57,656
You can write that down, Miek.

559
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:01,836
No!

560
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,432
Storm breaker, what are you doing?
Is this about Mjolnir?

561
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,225
Everyone, out!

562
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:18,979
Didn't find them.

563
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:20,146
Bae, your cape's on fire.

564
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:21,352
It's fine. It'll grow back.

565
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:22,478
I'm invoicing you for this.

566
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:23,566
Listen.

567
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:25,182
What do we know about this guy?

568
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,988
- He travels through shadows.
- And he creates monsters with them.

569
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:29,698
Absolutely freaky monsters.

570
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:31,825
He also wields the Necrosword.
How do I know that?

571
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,428
Because he almost speared me
in the face with it.

572
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:34,494
What's a Necrosword?

573
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:37,781
It's an ancient weapon that's been passed
through hands since the dawn of time.

574
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:40,209
It has the ability to slay gods...

575
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,045
but it slowly corrupts and kills
whoever wields it, which means...

576
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:46,173
- So, it infected him.
- It's infecting him. Yes. It must be.

577
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:50,844
So basically, we're up against a cursed,
shadow-zombie kidnapper.

578
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,638
Awesome. When do we leave?

579
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:53,805
Thor.

580
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:55,641
Can you see me?

581
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:56,975
Floating head alert.

582
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:58,977
It's Astrid. Heimdall's son.

583
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:00,771
Astrid, are you okay?

584
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,940
I no longer go by the name Astrid.

585
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:05,067
I'm now known as Axl.

586
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:07,361
He's a singer from a popular band
I heard on Earth.

587
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:08,695
- G N' R.
- Astrid...

588
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,781
your father gave you
a very tough Viking name...

589
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:12,449
and I intend to honor his wishes.

590
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:13,616
- Axl.
- Astrid.

591
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:14,910
- I said Axl.
- Astrid.

592
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:17,204
- Axl!
- It's asshole. Now listen to him!

593
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:19,957
All right, fine, Axl. Where are you?

594
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:23,335
I'm not sure. I don't know how to use
my magic eyes yet.

595
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:25,021
Your father taught me
and I'm gonna teach you.

596
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:27,506
I need you to focus and hold out your hand.

597
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:30,092
Okay, good. Now focus.

598
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:31,426
Close your eyes.

599
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:38,433
Thor!

600
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:41,687
Hey, how's it going, kids?

601
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:43,689
"How's it going?" Look where we are.

602
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,774
We're in a cage made of spikes.

603
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,068
Yes, right. Not good. Yeah.

604
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,315
Are you gonna do something?

605
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,988
Yes. Yes, I am, but just not right now.

606
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:53,156
I'm the vision ghost. Look.

607
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:56,243
- See?
- What will happen to us?

608
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:59,955
Who can tell? I mean,
this is a very, very bad situation.

609
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:02,541
You know,
the good news is you're Asgardians.

610
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,751
So, if you die, you'll end up in Valhalla.

611
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,086
Oh, my God. Go away.

612
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:07,337
Wait, wait. Listen.

613
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:12,384
Okay. It's all right, children.
Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

614
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:15,762
Listen, I've got a plan, okay? I'm putting
together a really, really good team.

615
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,683
We've got Uncle Korg, King Valkyrie...

616
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:24,188
my ex-girlfriend, Jane, which is a whole
other story I won't bore you with, okay?

617
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:26,315
But it is a top-notch team...

618
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:28,442
and we're gonna have you home
before you know it.

619
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:29,735
Yeah.

620
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:38,202
I know where you are.

621
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,581
I'm gonna get you out of here.

622
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,250
I'm scared. We all are.

623
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,420
Thor! Thor! Save us.

624
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:53,359
Get me out of here.
You take care, okay?

625
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:55,135
Take care. I'll see you soon.
All right?

626
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:56,553
Axl, get me out of here!

627
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,216
They're in the Shadow Realm.

628
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:00,307
How do you know?

629
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:03,018
The heavy atmosphere there
has a darkness like no other.

630
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:05,185
It's as if color fears to tread.
It's unmistakable.

631
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:07,606
Well then, if it's color we need...

632
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:09,566
let's bring the rainbow.

633
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:13,588
"Bring the rainbow"?
Is that a catchphrase or something?

634
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:15,197
She's only been a Thor for a minute.

635
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:18,176
I mean, saving lives, she's quite good at.
But the rest of it, she needs work.

636
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,120
- How many catchphrases have there been?
- A lot.

637
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,580
Yep. Jumped the gun.

638
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:26,750
Hang on, he moves through shadows
and he's going to the Shadow Realm...

639
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:28,603
it seems like that's where
he's going to be the most powerful.

640
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:30,730
You're right. We can't just go
marching in there. It could be a trap.

641
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:32,089
We'd be endangering the children.

642
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,091
We need reinforcements.
We must raise an army.

643
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:35,652
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

644
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:37,028
- I'm thinking it.
- What are we thinking?

645
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:38,571
- Thinking what?
- I'm thinking it too.

646
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:39,721
Omnipotence City.

647
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,599
What's Omnipotence City?

648
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:44,966
It's the home of the most powerful gods
in the universe.

649
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:46,937
We could pull together
the greatest team ever.

650
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:49,273
We could recruit Ra, Hercules...

651
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:50,524
Tūmatauenga.

652
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:54,361
Quetzalcoatl, maybe. And Zeus,
the oldest and wisest of them all.

653
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:55,779
Did you say Zeus?

654
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:56,780
Yeah, Zeus.

655
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,240
Like, the Zeus. Zeus-Zeus?

656
00:44:58,448 --> 00:44:59,843
I'm not sure if he has a second name.

657
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:02,077
Do you think my god will be there,
Ninny of the Nonny?

658
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:04,347
You never know, Korg. But if they are,
we'll ask them to join our team.

659
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:05,205
Yes.

660
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:06,373
Storm breaker.

661
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,042
All right. Calm down. Relax.

662
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:12,045
No, no, no, mate, we are not traveling
in Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

663
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:13,046
Look what just happened.

664
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:15,608
We can't exactly go in your tiny, little,
flying portal horse, can we?

665
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:16,632
We won't all fit.

666
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:18,111
What are you talking about?
Warsong's awesome.

667
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:19,261
Stormbreaker's awesome too.

668
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:20,828
Storm breaker just needs a conduit.

669
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,408
Anything that can handle space travel.

670
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:23,682
I love it when she talks shop.

671
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:25,118
It has the power to get us there...

672
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:28,770
it just needs something to focus
that energy so it's not so unpredictable.

673
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,857
You know, if we had a ship
we could harness it...

674
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,581
and use Storm breaker as a power source.

675
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,318
- Oh, like an engine.
- Like an engine.

676
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:35,736
You need a ship?

677
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,404
I've got a ship.

678
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,118
Get rid of all those seats.

679
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:45,329
And you guys,
go tie those goats to the front.

680
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:46,747
We leave in 15 minutes.

681
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,749
Essentials only, everyone.

682
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,459
That's essential.

683
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:52,044
Fifteen minutes to departure!

684
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:53,754
Well, you moved on quick, didn't you?

685
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,132
You're some piece of work.

686
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:00,469
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

687
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:03,222
- Just catching up with an old friend.
- Yeah.

688
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:05,140
I've been meaning to apologize.

689
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:08,681
Sorta acting a little weird before.
I just haven't really been myself lately.

690
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,229
You know, kind of...

691
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:13,357
Trying to figure out who I am,
and just felt a little bit lost.

692
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:16,109
And then, all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me...

693
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:17,569
and it was kind of...

694
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,196
It's a lot for me, too.

695
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:22,533
So, how did you guys get together?
How did this happen?

696
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:26,203
I swear I heard Mjolnir call to me.

697
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,871
Ah, did it?

698
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:29,706
And so I came here to investigate...

699
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:32,584
and its pieces started
glowing and swirling, and then...

700
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:33,836
Crazy.

701
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,420
...Thor.

702
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:39,007
Well, you know what,
it looks good on you, it works, so...

703
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:44,096
Just checking.

704
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,142
See you later.

705
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,436
Five minutes to departure!

706
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:56,692
What?

707
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,527
We were just talking.

708
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:11,999
<i>Mommy, don't leave me.</i>

709
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,001
Don't be afraid.

710
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,087
<i>Even when I'm gone, honey...</i>

711
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:20,674
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

712
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,387
<i>And whatever happens...</i>

713
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:28,974
<i>never stop fighting.</i>

714
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:31,351
<i>Never stop fighting.</i>

715
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:47,201
Hey. You all right?

716
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:48,535
Great.

717
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:51,496
The sink would say otherwise.

718
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:54,917
You think I really should be coming?

719
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,502
I'm not getting any better.

720
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,378
You're a Thor. Of course, you should come.

721
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:00,235
Besides, what else are you gonna do?

722
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:01,590
You're a Viking now.

723
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,884
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle...

724
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,136
and it needs to be devastatingly painful.

725
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:07,863
Otherwise, you don't get into Valhalla.

726
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:09,348
That's my plan.

727
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:11,767
What about, you know, kinging and stuff?

728
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:14,520
I love being king.
I love my people...

729
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:16,206
but it's all meetings and raven-mail...

730
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,950
and meetings that could've been raven-mail.

731
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:19,191
I miss fighting.

732
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:20,442
I miss my sisters.

733
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,529
Which is why you need to come,
'cause I need one.

734
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:24,695
Okay, we should go.

735
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:26,031
You packed?

736
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:27,616
Are you packed?

737
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:30,493
Yes!

738
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:33,956
A hand grenade?

739
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,666
No. It's a portable speaker.

740
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:43,465
Let's go.

741
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:47,928
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps?

742
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:49,388
I got you.

743
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:53,809
My fellow Asgardians...

744
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:58,313
Wish us well, for we shall travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

745
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:01,191
We will return with children.

746
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,278
Many children.

747
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:05,821
And then we shall feast!

748
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:07,197
Not on the children.

749
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,700
We do not do that anymore.

750
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:12,369
Those were dark times. Shameful times.

751
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,454
Okay, we should go.

752
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:02,669
So, you still rollerblading?

753
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,588
No. No. You?

754
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:06,006
Oh, yeah. Every weekend.

755
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,050
Once you blade, you never fade.
Right, Korg?

756
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:09,217
Skate mates for life!

757
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:11,220
- Hey, can I run something by you?
- Yeah.

758
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:12,387
So, I was thinking...

759
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:15,849
when we get to the bad guy, what about
if I had, like, a cool catchphrase?

760
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:17,935
Like, "Eat this hammer!"

761
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,271
Or, like, "Check out my hammer."

762
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,565
Like, what about...

763
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,609
No...
I'm work shopping it.

764
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:28,111
No, they are all really good.
Mine is...

765
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:30,030
"This ends here and now."

766
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:31,365
Oh, that's such a good one.

767
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:32,842
Took me a long time to perfect it.

768
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,260
You'll get there.
You just need to practice.

769
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:35,702
Just my first bad guy.

770
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,162
You never forget your first.

771
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:41,542
Yeah.

772
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,460
So, you got a girlfriend?

773
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:47,631
No, no. Too busy, don't have time,
you know?

774
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:50,092
Just the work and everything.

775
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:52,261
Cool. Gonna check this place out.

776
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:57,808
So cool.

777
00:50:57,975 --> 00:50:58,976
Who's so cool?

778
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:00,602
The buildings are cool.

779
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:02,521
- What's happening there?
- Where?

780
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:05,148
Am I sensing feelings?

781
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:07,442
Feelings? What, for Jane?

782
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:09,069
No, don't be ridiculous. Feelings.

783
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:10,988
The last time we had feelings were...

784
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:12,882
long time ago. Long, long gone.
I think you...

785
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:14,449
- Maybe you have feelings.
- Right.

786
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:17,554
- Mate, relax. We're on the same team.
- I don't know.

787
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:19,955
Know exactly what team we're on, okay?

788
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:21,498
Team Jane.

789
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:28,297
<i>Thing about Thor
is that he always bounces back.</i>

790
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:30,358
- Yeah.
- Like when Hela stole his hammer...

791
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:33,260
he went and built an axe which was forged
in the heart of a dying star.

792
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:39,057
And the same axe was used
to cut off Thanos' head.

793
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:42,519
That's a good one.

794
00:51:45,564 --> 00:51:47,816
What a neat story!

795
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:52,946
With all this talk
about chopping off heads...

796
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:54,448
I wanna have a go.

797
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:56,283
What's this?

798
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:04,166
This is Octy.
Hello, Octy.

799
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:06,001
How are you?

800
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,420
You know what Octy loves?

801
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:10,881
Having his head ripped off!

802
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:17,471
What?
You liked it a second ago.

803
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,057
All right, all right, all right.

804
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:21,350
Octy's gone.

805
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:26,355
Come on.

806
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:28,440
I'm scared.

807
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,192
Look at you.

808
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:34,363
I knew a little girl just like you.

809
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:38,534
And she was brave,
and she was smart...

810
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:43,830
and funny and she liked to draw.

811
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,293
Let me ask you a question...

812
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:51,088
about gods.

813
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,674
They're meant to protect you, right?

814
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:55,676
Well, where are they?

815
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:58,554
- Thor is on his way.
- Yeah!

816
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,390
Yes. I'm counting on that.

817
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:04,184
That's why you're here.

818
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:10,583
It's invitation only, so we're gonna have
to keep a low profile and blend in.

819
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:13,193
Luckily, disguises are my specialty.

820
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:14,987
Greek philosopher?

821
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:16,613
Got us these.

822
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,198
What are those?

823
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,366
Actual disguises.

824
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:22,244
They're the cloaks of the emotion gods.

825
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:26,081
Every color signifies a different emotion.

826
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,000
Where are the emotion gods?

827
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,585
Don't ask.

828
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:34,131
Holy shit.

829
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,142
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

830
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:48,520
This is where the most powerful
creator gods in the universe hang out.

831
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,277
There's the god of magic,
the god of dreams...

832
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:56,445
the god of carpentry.

833
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,905
Look at that one.

834
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,656
Oh, yes. That's Bao, god of dumplings.

835
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:01,825
- Hey, Bao!
- Bao.

836
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:02,993
Look up there, guys!

837
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,037
That's the Kronan god, Ninny of the Nonny.

838
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:07,331
Hey, Ninny Nonny!

839
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:20,385
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

840
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:23,138
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

841
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:50,958
Yes.

842
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:53,585
I am Zeus!

843
00:54:58,131 --> 00:54:59,341
There he is!

844
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:01,468
The man, the myth, the legend.

845
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:02,946
I don't know if you know this...

846
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,055
but I base a lot of what I do
on this guy.

847
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:06,991
He's the god of lightning,
I'm the god of thunder.

848
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:09,059
- Huge source of inspiration.
- That's really good.

849
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:11,812
You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

850
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:15,315
How do we get up there?
Do we just, like, fly?

851
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:16,960
No, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of an entrance.

852
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,610
He's famous for his entrances.

853
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:20,571
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt!

854
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:22,197
Yes!

855
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,285
Zeus!

856
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:37,713
Yes! Thunderbolt!

857
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,470
Order.

858
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:48,140
Order!

859
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:52,436
Silence! Silence!

860
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,525
I hereby open...

861
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:02,404
this holy council of the god.

862
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:07,367
Where we have many, many serious matter
to be talk about.

863
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:08,911
Such as...

864
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:12,039
where are we going
to hold this year's orgy?

865
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:14,041
Is this guy for real?

866
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,375
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

867
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,211
Yeah, I'm sure he has a point, okay?

868
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:18,712
Sorry.

869
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:20,190
So now we're going to
announce the winner...

870
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:25,302
of the, "Most human souls sacrificed
in the name of a god."

871
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:26,970
Okay, maybe he's not that great.

872
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:28,472
Oh, no, not good.

873
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,492
No, I don't think it's gonna get
any better than this.

874
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:31,934
Look, these gods aren't gonna help.

875
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,561
But that thunderbolt,
I think that might be of use.

876
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:36,647
Jane, you go right.
Thor, you go left.

877
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:39,233
We bum-rush him, take the bolt,
ding-dong.

878
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,485
- All right, let's go get it!
- No, no, no, wait!

879
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:43,320
There's no ding-donging or bum-rushing.

880
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:44,947
Especially not Zeus' bum.

881
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:46,758
When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

882
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:47,616
The time is right now.

883
00:56:47,783 --> 00:56:48,783
Time is not right now.

884
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:50,160
Who is talking?

885
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:51,370
Who is talking?

886
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:52,829
- These guys.
- Korg, shut up.

887
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:55,415
Do you have something to say to the group?

888
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:56,792
Sorry.

889
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,670
I'm bashing heads in 60 seconds,
so speak fast.

890
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:01,296
Literally, heads will roll.

891
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:03,382
Who are you two?

892
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:05,259
Hello.

893
00:57:05,843 --> 00:57:08,443
Let me be the first to say it is an honor
and a privilege to be...

894
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:09,680
No, I can't hear you.

895
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:11,181
Why don't you take the stage?

896
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,225
The stage down there?

897
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:17,646
Well, yes. You see the area
that looks very much like a stage?

898
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,190
Got ya.

899
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:28,406
Coming through.

900
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:30,826
Oops. Sorry.

901
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:31,994
Good luck, bro.

902
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:41,128
Mighty Zeus!

903
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:42,796
Wow!

904
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,965
Gods of the universe...

905
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:48,719
I come here to ask for your help,
to raise an army.

906
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:52,014
There's a maniac called the God Butcher
who seeks to end us all.

907
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:53,682
His destruction is everywhere.

908
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:55,851
Entire planets, realms...

909
00:57:56,018 --> 00:57:57,538
have been left completely unprotected.

910
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:59,771
He's left nothing but chaos in his wake.

911
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:01,732
But I know where he is...

912
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:06,028
and with your help we can crush him
before he kills anyone else.

913
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,863
That guy...

914
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,908
he killed a couple of low-level god.

915
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:12,242
Boo-hoo.

916
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:13,744
If that's all...

917
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:15,037
pretty boy...

918
00:58:15,204 --> 00:58:16,955
you go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

919
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:20,125
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Did you not hear any of what I just said?

920
00:58:20,709 --> 00:58:22,252
He's murdering en masse.

921
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,505
I tell you one time...

922
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,672
now, you shut up.

923
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:26,840
You be quiet.

924
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,635
Because you are this close
to being uninvited to the orgy.

925
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:32,095
Zeus, we must do something.

926
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,056
You cannot come to the orgy!

927
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:36,141
- You have to listen to us!
- That's it!

928
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:37,684
Shackle!

929
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:41,915
Your Highness, whenever you're ready,
you just tell me.

930
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,139
- We go on my signal.
- Mm-hmm.

931
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:44,274
What is the signal?

932
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:45,442
It'll be, "Go."

933
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:50,906
Let's see who you are.

934
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:52,658
I take off your disguise.

935
00:58:52,824 --> 00:58:53,824
And flick!

936
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:03,627
You flicked too hard, damn it!

937
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,423
Should we help him?

938
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,925
I mean, eventually.

939
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:11,134
Grape?

940
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:12,970
Looks like a shy courgette.

941
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,888
And what about the others?

942
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,295
We take off their disguise too.

943
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:17,558
Oh, no. No. Don't flick us.

944
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:18,725
It's cool.

945
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:20,352
Disguise gone!

946
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:21,435
Disguise off. Cool?

947
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:22,771
Asgardians.

948
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:25,732
I thought we'd seen the last of you
when Odin died.

949
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:29,528
You are Thor...

950
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,530
the God of Thunder.

951
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:35,492
But is not thunder
just the sound of lightning?

952
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:38,996
Good one, Dad.

953
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:40,372
Zeus, this is bigger than us.

954
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:42,541
He's taken Asgardian children.

955
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:45,961
Who do you think we are?
The god police?

956
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:49,798
Every god watches over their own peoples.

957
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:52,843
Nothing more, nothing less.

958
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,678
Asgardian problems...

959
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,764
are Asgardian problems.

960
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,392
How the mighty have fallen.

961
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,728
My hero, Zeus...

962
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:03,896
afraid.

963
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:17,451
Couple of thing.

964
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:21,121
One, yes, I am scared.

965
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:23,999
Gorr has the Necrosword...

966
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,293
which means he could kill us.

967
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:28,212
Not good. Two...

968
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:30,297
I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

969
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:31,632
I understand.

970
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:34,009
But all you do is cause a panic.

971
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:36,136
Panic is not good.

972
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:37,804
We are safe here.

973
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,349
You, my friend. You are safe here.

974
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:42,559
So, chill, baby cake.

975
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,270
Have some wine, have some grape.

976
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:46,897
Anything goes here...

977
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:49,316
in Omnipotence City.

978
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:52,528
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

979
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:55,030
I flicked too hard.
I put your clothes back on.

980
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,242
Now I put your clothes back on!

981
01:00:58,408 --> 01:00:59,284
Flick, flick.

982
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:02,120
For this is the Golden Temple of the god.

983
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:04,748
It's not a rudie-nudie festival.

984
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:07,849
If you're not gonna help us,
then at least let us use your weapon.

985
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:09,461
We need your lightning bolt.

986
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:12,339
My lightning bolt is called Thunderbolt.

987
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:15,717
So, I think to use
somebody's secret weapon like this...

988
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:18,428
that you should at least get the name right
when you ask.

989
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,764
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

990
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:21,932
Thunderbolt!

991
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:50,544
No!

992
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:55,883
Do not worry.

993
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,260
The God Butcher...

994
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:00,846
he will not reach Eternity.

995
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,222
Eternity?

996
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:04,099
What does he mean, reach Eternity?

997
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:09,313
Oh, shit.

998
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:16,320
Eternity is a very powerful being
at the center of the universe.

999
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:20,073
It will grant the desire
of the first person who reaches it.

1000
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,075
So, it's like a wishing well?

1001
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:27,331
What do you think a guy called
the God Butcher would wish for?

1002
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:30,457
If he seeks the Altar of Eternity,
that means he could wipe us out at once.

1003
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:32,169
Zeus, we must act now.

1004
01:02:32,336 --> 01:02:34,087
He's not going to make it.

1005
01:02:34,254 --> 01:02:35,547
He doesn't have the key.

1006
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:37,883
Is this the purpose of the gods?

1007
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,719
To hide away in a golden
palace like cowards?

1008
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,346
Maybe we have lost our way.

1009
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,932
You know what?
We'll stop him ourselves.

1010
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:47,267
I am afraid I cannot allow that.

1011
01:02:47,643 --> 01:02:49,978
This is a secret place...

1012
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:51,939
known only to the gods.

1013
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:54,024
You know where we are.

1014
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:57,819
The God Butcher could use you
to find us.

1015
01:02:58,570 --> 01:02:59,905
This is no good.

1016
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:02,074
So now...

1017
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,826
you must stay.

1018
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:07,204
Guards!

1019
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:10,874
Hey.

1020
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:12,041
Can we do my plan now?

1021
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:13,961
Yes. Rush his bum.

1022
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:15,128
Hell, yeah!

1023
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:19,550
You didn't say, "Go."

1024
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:25,556
Coming, guys!

1025
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:36,775
Thor, catch!

1026
01:03:39,945 --> 01:03:40,946
Korg!

1027
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:01,550
Val, duck!

1028
01:04:07,014 --> 01:04:08,015
Korg!

1029
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:11,225
Thor.

1030
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:14,813
Oh, no. No. Korg!

1031
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,901
Thor, I'm perishing!

1032
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:24,865
Zeus!

1033
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,410
You're next, Odinson!

1034
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:38,420
That's the sound of lightning.

1035
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:46,803
No!

1036
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:49,556
Korgi. Korgi!

1037
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:50,724
Thor.

1038
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:52,226
- Korgi?
- I'm down here.

1039
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:54,686
Where? Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out. It's okay.

1040
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:56,104
- Korg. Korgi!
- Here I am!

1041
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,271
I didn't die!

1042
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:59,483
Oh, my God.
Yes! You're alive!

1043
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,152
Turns out the only part of a Kronan
that's alive is his mouth.

1044
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:04,613
Korgi, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

1045
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,780
I'll do my best.

1046
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:07,199
Guard him with your life.

1047
01:05:07,366 --> 01:05:08,200
I will.

1048
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:09,367
Ready to go for a ride?

1049
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:14,915
Now you've got my six.

1050
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:16,625
Eight o'clock, Val.

1051
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:18,627
7:48.

1052
01:05:20,045 --> 01:05:21,338
I can do this, damn it.

1053
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,608
No, that's not it. No, that's not it.

1054
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:24,675
Nope.

1055
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,261
Come on, Korg, purse those lips.

1056
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:41,984
I did it!

1057
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:22,065
And then the goat boat came in,
rescued us...

1058
01:06:22,232 --> 01:06:24,693
and we flew out the window.
The end.

1059
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,403
Another classic Thor adventure.

1060
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,614
I can't believe you killed Zeus.

1061
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,658
Well, you know what they say,
never meet your heroes.

1062
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,730
But what's important is
we are on our way to you right now.

1063
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:37,789
How are you guys doing?
Are you okay?

1064
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:39,541
We're all right. A little scared.

1065
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,793
Well, listen, I know
what it's like to be scared.

1066
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,560
And I'll tell you,
when I was your age...

1067
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:45,482
I don't think I would have been
as brave as you.

1068
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:46,507
Really?

1069
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:49,510
In fact, might just be
the bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.

1070
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:50,802
All of you.

1071
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:52,888
So I need you to
keep being brave, all right?

1072
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,224
And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

1073
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,808
Team Kids in a Cage.

1074
01:06:58,435 --> 01:06:59,478
Can you do that?

1075
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:02,231
Yeah. I think we can do that.

1076
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:03,982
I know you can.

1077
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:08,529
Right?

1078
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:10,113
- Thor?
- Yeah.

1079
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:11,949
I'm glad I met my hero.

1080
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:13,283
Oh, thanks, buddy.

1081
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:19,373
How are the children?

1082
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,309
As you can imagine, they're a little bit
scared because they're kids...

1083
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,102
but I told them that
everything is going to plan.

1084
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,126
Oh, so you lied to them?

1085
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:25,211
We still have a plan?

1086
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:26,439
- Yes, there's a plan.
- There's no plan.

1087
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:28,590
- There is a plan.
- No. There's no plan.

1088
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:30,801
We failed to raise a god army...

1089
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:31,969
Korg is dead.

1090
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:33,363
- He's not dead.
- I'm not dead.

1091
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:34,847
Well, he's a head. And you...

1092
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:36,390
you got properly humiliated.

1093
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:38,851
No, I got properly naked,
which I am okay with.

1094
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:40,602
- Jane?
- I was okay with it.

1095
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:41,895
- Korg?
- I loved it.

1096
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:43,998
The point is,
we are going into the Shadow Realm...

1097
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:45,315
weaker than we were before.

1098
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:46,775
I mean, we're gonna die.

1099
01:07:46,942 --> 01:07:48,402
- No one's gonna die, okay?
- Really?

1100
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:50,821
Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

1101
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:52,906
- We killed Zeus!
- You killed Zeus.

1102
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:55,993
I mean, that may or may not be catastrophic
for the whole universe...

1103
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,179
and, sure, the entire god kingdom
is probably going...

1104
01:07:58,203 --> 01:07:59,722
to hunt us down
for the rest of our days...

1105
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:02,249
but listen, you stole
this beautiful weapon.

1106
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,293
All right? This is the army right here.

1107
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:07,462
It's sleek, it's slender,
it's powerful, it's beautiful...

1108
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:11,383
For you. I love it for you, Valkyrie.

1109
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,150
I mean, it's not really what I'm into...

1110
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,095
'cause I've got my weapon out there.

1111
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:16,889
Can I borrow that for a second?

1112
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:22,185
There you are, old friend.

1113
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:24,979
That was quite an entrance back there.

1114
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:32,029
Listen...

1115
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:33,447
are we good?

1116
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:34,781
Yeah?

1117
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:37,468
I mean, I know it's a little weird
having my ex-weapon around...

1118
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:39,995
but come on, Mjolnir, in the past.

1119
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:41,496
It's you and me now, buddy.

1120
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:43,332
You know what?

1121
01:08:43,497 --> 01:08:45,834
I think it's time for your first beer.
What do you say?

1122
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:53,050
Delicious.

1123
01:08:53,716 --> 01:08:55,385
I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

1124
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:04,435
Hey.

1125
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:05,854
Oh, hey.

1126
01:09:08,607 --> 01:09:10,399
It's quite the view, huh?

1127
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,027
Yeah. Beautiful.

1128
01:09:12,194 --> 01:09:15,863
I just want to say that was very, very
impressive what you did back there.

1129
01:09:16,573 --> 01:09:18,408
You and Mjolnir, you know.

1130
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:22,037
Yeah.

1131
01:09:24,665 --> 01:09:26,457
- Space dolphins.
- What?

1132
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:28,856
You should see some space dolphins...

1133
01:09:29,002 --> 01:09:30,002
What?

1134
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:32,089
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1135
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:33,799
Beautiful.

1136
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:36,134
So beautiful. So rare.

1137
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:37,344
Very loyal creatures.

1138
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:40,264
They mate for life, in packs of six.

1139
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,182
Just love.

1140
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:45,227
<i>With a hey ninny-nonny
and a fair finny-fonny</i>

1141
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:48,729
<i>Ooh, brother man, you look so hot</i>

1142
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:51,733
<i>I wanna get in your rocks</i>

1143
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:55,279
<i>When we get together
We're gonna get it on</i>

1144
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:59,199
<i>And we're all gonna make some babies</i>

1145
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:03,871
That is the song that my dad sang
to my other dad when they were courting.

1146
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:06,957
When two Kronans wanna make a baby,
they get together inside a mountain...

1147
01:10:07,124 --> 01:10:10,586
and they go down to a little lava pool,
and they hold hands over the hot lava...

1148
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:13,005
and then, after a month,
they pull their hands apart...

1149
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:16,175
and they find they've created
a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1150
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:18,510
Fascinating. And hot.

1151
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:20,155
Did you ever have a special someone?

1152
01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:22,973
I've had so many special someones.

1153
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,434
But I don't know...

1154
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:27,787
I don't know if I want that again.

1155
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:30,582
Is that because you lost your girlfriend
in battle and never forgave yourself?

1156
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:33,334
And now, you're just trying to find answers
in the bottom of a bottle...

1157
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:36,195
or some meaningless dalliance,
which only serves to numb the pain...

1158
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:38,989
instead of bringing you real happiness
or satisfaction?

1159
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:41,491
Yeah. Something like that.

1160
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:47,164
Beautiful. Beautiful things.

1161
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,461
Jane.

1162
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,921
Thor.

1163
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:55,339
I wanna feel shitty about you.

1164
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:56,507
What?

1165
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:04,223
I wanna feel shitty about something
and I think that's you.

1166
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:05,589
Not really getting any better.

1167
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:07,100
It's not, is it? Damn it.

1168
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:11,396
My friend, he told me
that it's better to feel shitty...

1169
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:14,709
from losing love
than it is to never experience love...

1170
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:16,294
and to feel nothing at all,
to feel empty...

1171
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:17,398
and I think he was right...

1172
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:20,697
which is how I've been feeling
for a long time.

1173
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:23,158
I've pushed people away,
kept them at a distance...

1174
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:24,725
because of the fear of that loss...

1175
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:26,971
but I don't wanna do that anymore.
I don't wanna live like that.

1176
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:28,765
Better to close off your heart
than feel the pain.

1177
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:31,041
That's what I did, yes.
I closed off my heart...

1178
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:32,918
and I meditated.
Did you meditate?

1179
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:34,253
No. It's so boring.

1180
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:36,088
It actually made me more angry.

1181
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:39,591
But I'm tired of giving myself over
to the idea of fate...

1182
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,052
and trying to figure out
what the universe wants from me.

1183
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:44,823
I wanna live in the moment,
I wanna live like there's no tomorrow...

1184
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:45,931
throw caution to the wind.

1185
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:48,058
I wanna be with you, Jane.

1186
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:50,185
What do you say?

1187
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:52,354
I have cancer.

1188
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:55,774
I'm sorry. What?

1189
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,401
I'm sick.

1190
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:59,194
- Wait. What's happening?
- Bye.

1191
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:02,239
No, no, no. Jane, Jane, Jane.
Wait, wait, wait. Jane.

1192
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:04,950
What did I say? I didn't mean that.
Just kidding.

1193
01:12:06,577 --> 01:12:08,120
I don't have cancer.

1194
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:09,705
Let's go smash something.

1195
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:11,498
Jane, I'm so sorry.

1196
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:13,625
Don't be sorry for me.

1197
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,712
When did you find out?

1198
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:20,716
Like six months ago.

1199
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:24,678
I was just feeling tired,
and then they told me I have Stage Four.

1200
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:26,555
Get my affairs in order.

1201
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:29,725
And then I heard Mjolnir calling me...

1202
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,978
so I thought maybe,
if science isn't working...

1203
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:36,356
maybe Viking space magic.

1204
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:38,859
That's why you came to New Asgard.

1205
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:41,862
Yeah, I thought the hammer
maybe could cure me...

1206
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:44,948
and I think it's getting better.

1207
01:12:45,616 --> 01:12:47,075
Maybe not.

1208
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:50,329
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

1209
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:52,748
We don't know what tomorrow holds.

1210
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:53,916
And Mjolnir...

1211
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:55,542
Mjolnir chose you.

1212
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:58,337
And it chose you because you're worthy.

1213
01:12:58,504 --> 01:12:59,755
And that's something.

1214
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:01,048
When I first met you...

1215
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:04,343
I was unworthy.
I was unable to pick up that hammer.

1216
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:06,386
But you taught me...

1217
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:09,515
there is no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

1218
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:12,351
You made me worthy.

1219
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,979
So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

1220
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:19,149
Okay.

1221
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:21,068
Now what do you wanna do?

1222
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,863
I wanna get those children
back to their families.

1223
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,281
I wanna finish that mission.

1224
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:28,909
Spoken like a true Thor.

1225
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:32,037
How do you feel now?

1226
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:34,373
So scared.

1227
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:36,667
How are you feeling?

1228
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:38,043
Shitty.

1229
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,210
How shitty?

1230
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:40,879
- Really shitty.
- Well, then...

1231
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:54,055
I wonder what those two are talking about
out there.

1232
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:55,936
Yeah, they're not talking.

1233
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,985
Do you think those two will ever hold hands
over a hot lava pool and make a Thor baby?

1234
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,947
It's unlikely, sadly.

1235
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:10,242
That's too bad.
I think Thor would make a great dad.

1236
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:14,872
Hey. We're here.

1237
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:25,424
Where did all the color go?

1238
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:00,125
They're not here.

1239
01:15:05,631 --> 01:15:06,673
Where are they?

1240
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:27,653
What the hell is this place?

1241
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:58,016
Bifrost is the key?

1242
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:08,652
It's a trap!

1243
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:28,648
You wanna tell me why you just threw
Storm breaker out the window?

1244
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:30,799
He needs it to open the Gates of Eternity.

1245
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:03,725
We really have to stop meeting like this.

1246
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:04,791
Call the axe.

1247
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:06,603
I'll call the axe when
you call the dentist.

1248
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:09,254
Call the axe.

1249
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,507
Tell me where the children are
or I'm gonna kill you.

1250
01:17:18,597 --> 01:17:20,015
Call the axe.

1251
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:29,066
Some god you are.

1252
01:17:29,942 --> 01:17:33,320
You know nothing of being a god.

1253
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:40,369
You went to the gods for help,
and they did nothing.

1254
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:43,205
We're alike in that sense.

1255
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:45,082
He's nothing like you.

1256
01:17:45,249 --> 01:17:46,750
What was that?

1257
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,713
I said he's nothing like you.

1258
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,257
That's right.

1259
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:57,803
I'm not a hypocrite.
I'm truly creating peace.

1260
01:17:57,970 --> 01:17:59,721
Peace? You're murdering innocent gods.

1261
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:00,931
Innocent?

1262
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:03,100
Are you a Valkyrie?

1263
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:04,267
Yes.

1264
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:06,937
How exciting!

1265
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:11,024
Oh, the gods failed you, too...

1266
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:15,070
when your sisterhood was led to slaughter.

1267
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:16,321
Don't you dare speak...

1268
01:18:17,114 --> 01:18:19,157
Did you pray to the gods...

1269
01:18:19,324 --> 01:18:23,579
when the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

1270
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:27,583
Did you beg them for help...

1271
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,294
as your family was massacred?

1272
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:34,256
Good chat.

1273
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:39,178
This one.

1274
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:41,430
You're interesting.

1275
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:44,099
You're different.

1276
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:46,018
Yes.

1277
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:55,611
You're dying.

1278
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:58,655
I'm sorry.

1279
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:01,658
We're on the same path.

1280
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:07,289
Just as the sword empowered me...

1281
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:10,083
the hammer empowered you.

1282
01:19:11,043 --> 01:19:13,754
But it did nothing
to change your fate.

1283
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:17,883
The gods will use you...

1284
01:19:18,759 --> 01:19:21,470
but they will not help you.

1285
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:27,059
There is no eternal reward for us.

1286
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,192
She'll be gone soon.

1287
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:38,695
And you know who won't help her?

1288
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:40,614
I'll give you one guess.

1289
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,210
I know your pain.

1290
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:55,379
Love is pain.

1291
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:02,427
I had a daughter once.

1292
01:20:03,262 --> 01:20:05,222
I put my faith in a higher power...

1293
01:20:05,389 --> 01:20:08,100
hoping it would save her...

1294
01:20:08,267 --> 01:20:09,935
and she...

1295
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:12,855
died.

1296
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,986
Now I understand.

1297
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:21,405
My daughter is the lucky one.

1298
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:27,244
She does not have to grow up
in a world of suffering...

1299
01:20:27,411 --> 01:20:28,912
and pain...

1300
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:33,333
run by wicked gods.

1301
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:37,379
Choose love.

1302
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:41,967
Call the axe.

1303
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:52,686
Call...

1304
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:54,479
the axe.

1305
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:32,017
You okay?

1306
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:33,268
Yeah.

1307
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:37,272
I wanna kill this guy.

1308
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:39,900
So do I, but we have to take him alive.

1309
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:42,069
He's our only link to
finding those children.

1310
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:57,811
Thank you, Mr. Goat.

1311
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:31,595
Val!

1312
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:44,107
We gotta get her out of here!

1313
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:55,160
Hey. I got you.

1314
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,173
Hey, guys, we're here.
Come on, let's go.

1315
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:10,259
Storm breaker, take us home.

1316
01:25:05,898 --> 01:25:08,150
...at a rate that
none of us have seen before.

1317
01:25:08,317 --> 01:25:11,486
Look, there are other more aggressive forms
of treatment we can try...

1318
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:14,823
but something's affecting her
body's ability to fight the cancer.

1319
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:17,367
I'm sorry, Thor.

1320
01:25:31,381 --> 01:25:33,008
There you are. Okay.

1321
01:25:33,175 --> 01:25:34,218
What's goin' on out there?

1322
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:37,262
Some moron made a fridge without a door.
Can you believe it?

1323
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:40,474
Not to worry. Got it open
and got you all sorts of goodies.

1324
01:25:40,641 --> 01:25:41,642
How's Val?

1325
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:44,311
She's in a lot of pain,
but she is stable.

1326
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:45,478
Okay, good.

1327
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:48,232
Now you just gotta get this out of my...

1328
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:49,918
No, no, no.
That's gotta stay in there.

1329
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:53,278
That's all the magic potions
and elixirs doing their thing, so...

1330
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:56,758
I'm just gonna pop out for a moment,
pick up the kids, kill the bad guy...

1331
01:25:56,782 --> 01:25:58,102
and then I'll come straight back.

1332
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:00,702
You're going without me?

1333
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:02,454
Yeah.

1334
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:04,581
What happened to, like,
doing everything together?

1335
01:26:04,748 --> 01:26:06,667
He's gonna use those kids to distract you.

1336
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:07,918
You need me.

1337
01:26:08,085 --> 01:26:10,295
I do need you, Jane. I need you alive.

1338
01:26:10,462 --> 01:26:13,465
It'd be great to have you on the
battlefield, fighting Gorr side by side...

1339
01:26:13,632 --> 01:26:15,425
but that hammer is killing you.

1340
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,763
Every time you use it, it's
draining all of your mortal strength...

1341
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:22,099
leaving your body
unable to fight the cancer.

1342
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:24,851
What happened to,
"Live like there's no tomorrow"?

1343
01:26:24,977 --> 01:26:26,937
Well, that's before I knew
you might not have one.

1344
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,397
Why not have one more adventure?

1345
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:30,765
Jane, if there's a chance to live,
you have to take it.

1346
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:33,735
Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

1347
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:41,201
I know I seem like some cool astrophysicist
from New Mexico...

1348
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:43,954
just living the dream,
but look at me.

1349
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:47,791
I wanna keep fighting.
I'm the Mighty Thor.

1350
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,198
And you want me not to do that?

1351
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:51,920
What's the point of more time of this?

1352
01:26:52,963 --> 01:26:54,506
Because I love you.

1353
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,760
I've always loved you.

1354
01:26:59,845 --> 01:27:01,889
And this is a chance for us.

1355
01:27:02,598 --> 01:27:06,143
But if you pick up that damn hammer again,
then that chance is gone.

1356
01:27:18,197 --> 01:27:19,615
It's your choice, Jane.

1357
01:27:20,782 --> 01:27:23,543
But I'd regret it every single day
if I didn't ask you to stay here...

1358
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,579
so we could try and
figure this out together.

1359
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,751
You better come back to me.

1360
01:27:31,627 --> 01:27:33,587
I'm coming back as soon as I can.

1361
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:38,592
- Break a leg.
- I'll break all his legs.

1362
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:54,417
Remember that the Gate to Eternity
is at the literal center...

1363
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:55,627
- of the universe.
- Universe. Yes.

1364
01:27:55,651 --> 01:27:57,045
If you go past the cluster of comets...

1365
01:27:57,069 --> 01:27:59,549
Yes, yes, I know. We've been over this.
I'm not gonna get lost.

1366
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:02,241
So how you feeling with the old stab wound?

1367
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:03,575
I think I lost my kidney.

1368
01:28:03,742 --> 01:28:04,993
Gone completely?

1369
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,245
I wish I could join you...

1370
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:08,914
but I'd probably die,
and that won't help get the kids back...

1371
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:10,499
so you'll have to go alone.

1372
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:13,669
All you have to do is destroy that sword.

1373
01:28:13,836 --> 01:28:16,463
It's his source of power.
He won't survive long without it.

1374
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:20,425
Hey. Don't die.

1375
01:28:20,801 --> 01:28:21,969
Yeah, I know.

1376
01:29:15,731 --> 01:29:17,733
Eternity.

1377
01:29:20,027 --> 01:29:21,445
Finally.

1378
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:37,461
Come on.

1379
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,321
Hey, kids.

1380
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:08,200
I knew he'd come.

1381
01:30:08,951 --> 01:30:09,952
Go!

1382
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:11,119
Go, kids!

1383
01:30:20,212 --> 01:30:22,965
Everyone okay? All right, gather round.
Gather round.

1384
01:30:23,423 --> 01:30:26,176
Good to see you in person, buddy.
Good to see you.

1385
01:30:37,062 --> 01:30:38,540
All right, listen up.
Here's the plan.

1386
01:30:38,564 --> 01:30:40,691
We're gonna sneak our way
towards Storm breaker...

1387
01:30:40,858 --> 01:30:44,778
being very careful not to bump into
any of those big shadow monsters.

1388
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:47,698
They're behind me, aren't they?

1389
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:55,012
Does anyone here have battle experience?

1390
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:56,122
Battle experience?

1391
01:30:56,248 --> 01:30:58,208
Well, no time to learn
like the present.

1392
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:00,794
We're not strong like you. We're just kids.

1393
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:02,921
Hey, don't forget you're Asgardian kids.

1394
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,090
I'm not. I'm just a Lycan kid.

1395
01:31:05,257 --> 01:31:06,383
And I'm a Midassian kid.

1396
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:07,790
- I'm Falligarian.
- Okay, okay.

1397
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:10,304
But today you're Asgardians.

1398
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,722
Now collect your weapons.

1399
01:31:11,889 --> 01:31:12,889
What?

1400
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:14,933
Go and find anything you can pick up.

1401
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,101
Bring it back here.

1402
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:17,895
Hurry, hurry!

1403
01:31:18,437 --> 01:31:19,563
Okay, cool. Come on!

1404
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:22,441
They're getting closer.
Hurry up!

1405
01:31:22,608 --> 01:31:23,609
Come on!

1406
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:28,822
Today is a day that
will go down in history.

1407
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:32,993
Today is the day they will talk about
for generations to come.

1408
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,537
Today we are Space Vikings!

1409
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:38,248
Present arms!

1410
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:46,298
Whosoever holds these weapons,
and believes in getting home...

1411
01:31:46,465 --> 01:31:49,301
if they be true of heart
is therefore worthy...

1412
01:31:49,468 --> 01:31:50,928
and shall possess...

1413
01:31:51,929 --> 01:31:53,472
for limited time only...

1414
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:57,726
the power of Thor!

1415
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:08,278
General Axl...

1416
01:32:09,947 --> 01:32:11,740
lead your army to that axe.

1417
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:13,909
We shall do our worst.

1418
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:16,703
For Asgard.

1419
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:14,154
Yeah!

1420
01:34:16,615 --> 01:34:17,616
No.

1421
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:33,382
Jane.

1422
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:51,984
We destroy that sword and he's dead.

1423
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:54,350
The gateway's almost open.
You gotta stop Storm breaker.

1424
01:34:54,987 --> 01:34:56,321
It's okay. I got him.

1425
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:05,873
Storm breaker, stop this!

1426
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:08,393
Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing!

1427
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:09,751
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1428
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:13,130
Come on. Come on, buddy.

1429
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:21,638
Let go of my friend.

1430
01:35:25,809 --> 01:35:27,311
You've lost, Lady Thor.

1431
01:35:34,776 --> 01:35:35,776
First off...

1432
01:35:36,153 --> 01:35:38,780
the name is Mighty Thor.

1433
01:35:40,365 --> 01:35:41,658
And secondly...

1434
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:43,827
if you can't say Mighty Thor...

1435
01:35:44,828 --> 01:35:48,457
I'll accept Doctor Jane Foster.

1436
01:35:52,419 --> 01:35:53,629
And thirdly...

1437
01:35:54,338 --> 01:35:57,216
Eat my hammer!

1438
01:36:05,516 --> 01:36:07,851
Storm breaker!

1439
01:36:12,189 --> 01:36:13,440
I knew you could do it.

1440
01:36:14,566 --> 01:36:16,527
Axl! Get them home!

1441
01:38:05,552 --> 01:38:06,678
Jane?

1442
01:38:07,179 --> 01:38:08,180
I'm okay.

1443
01:38:08,555 --> 01:38:09,848
You have to stop him.

1444
01:38:40,128 --> 01:38:41,505
Gorr! Stop!

1445
01:38:46,176 --> 01:38:48,303
What kind of father would I be...

1446
01:38:48,887 --> 01:38:50,472
if I stopped?

1447
01:38:54,393 --> 01:38:57,604
I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

1448
01:38:59,565 --> 01:39:02,484
It's not death or revenge that you seek.

1449
01:39:05,237 --> 01:39:07,573
What do I seek?

1450
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:22,296
You seek love.

1451
01:39:25,674 --> 01:39:26,967
Love?

1452
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:30,012
Why should I seek love?

1453
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:32,556
Because it's all any of us want.

1454
01:39:35,017 --> 01:39:36,185
How...

1455
01:39:36,351 --> 01:39:40,063
dare you turn your back on me?

1456
01:39:41,607 --> 01:39:43,400
You've won, Gorr.

1457
01:39:43,567 --> 01:39:45,402
Why would I spend
my last moments with you...

1458
01:39:45,569 --> 01:39:46,945
when I can be with her?

1459
01:39:48,322 --> 01:39:49,823
I choose love.

1460
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:52,868
You can, too. You can bring her back.

1461
01:39:56,788 --> 01:39:58,498
Make your wish.

1462
01:40:29,696 --> 01:40:31,073
I'm dying.

1463
01:40:32,533 --> 01:40:34,159
She would have no one.

1464
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:37,204
She would be alone.

1465
01:40:44,503 --> 01:40:46,505
She won't be alone.

1466
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:58,118
My love.

1467
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:10,088
I've missed you so much.

1468
01:42:12,966 --> 01:42:14,593
I missed you too.

1469
01:42:18,138 --> 01:42:19,389
I'm so sorry.

1470
01:42:19,556 --> 01:42:20,557
It's okay.

1471
01:42:22,643 --> 01:42:25,062
Ever since I picked up that hammer...

1472
01:42:26,897 --> 01:42:28,232
it's like...

1473
01:42:28,982 --> 01:42:30,442
I've gotten an extra life.

1474
01:42:31,902 --> 01:42:33,820
And it was...

1475
01:42:35,531 --> 01:42:37,032
magical.

1476
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:41,954
Not too bad for a human.

1477
01:42:43,622 --> 01:42:45,165
Not too bad for a god.

1478
01:42:46,124 --> 01:42:50,045
Hey. I think I figured out my catchphrase.

1479
01:42:50,462 --> 01:42:52,047
- Oh, yeah? What is it?
- Come close...

1480
01:42:58,011 --> 01:42:59,179
It's perfect.

1481
01:42:59,346 --> 01:43:00,639
It's the best one yet.

1482
01:43:00,806 --> 01:43:02,015
Thanks.

1483
01:43:10,107 --> 01:43:12,359
Keep your heart open.

1484
01:43:17,865 --> 01:43:19,283
I love you.

1485
01:43:20,534 --> 01:43:22,035
I love you, too.

1486
01:44:07,706 --> 01:44:09,208
Protect her.

1487
01:44:10,751 --> 01:44:12,085
Protect my love.

1488
01:44:46,078 --> 01:44:49,915
<i>Let me tell you
the legend of the Space Viking...</i>

1489
01:44:50,707 --> 01:44:55,879
<i>AKA the Mighty Thor,
AKA Dr. Jane Foster.</i>

1490
01:44:58,131 --> 01:45:00,592
<i>Her sacrifice saved the universe...</i>

1491
01:45:00,759 --> 01:45:04,388
<i>and taught us all
what it means to be worthy.</i>

1492
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:06,849
<i>She helped the children of the gods...</i>

1493
01:45:07,015 --> 01:45:09,309
<i>who laser-beamed
their way back home...</i>

1494
01:45:09,476 --> 01:45:13,397
<i>to their dozy little fishing village
turned tourist destination.</i>

1495
01:45:14,481 --> 01:45:15,566
Axl!

1496
01:45:15,732 --> 01:45:17,192
I missed you.

1497
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,962
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1498
01:45:18,986 --> 01:45:20,112
- Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

1499
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:21,719
<i>The kids were safe to be kids again.</i>

1500
01:45:21,864 --> 01:45:23,240
Louder, three!

1501
01:45:24,867 --> 01:45:25,868
Widen your stance.

1502
01:45:26,034 --> 01:45:29,454
<i>Especially after their king made them
all go to self-defense classes.</i>

1503
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:31,415
<i>Look at all those budding Space Vikings.</i>

1504
01:45:31,582 --> 01:45:32,708
And the most important part.

1505
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:34,543
The war cry!

1506
01:45:36,003 --> 01:45:37,254
<i>Even Heimdall's son...</i>

1507
01:45:37,421 --> 01:45:39,089
<i>Axl Heimdall son...</i>

1508
01:45:39,256 --> 01:45:41,466
<i>who could now do
his dad's freaky eye magic...</i>

1509
01:45:41,633 --> 01:45:43,468
<i>was becoming quite the warrior.</i>

1510
01:45:43,927 --> 01:45:46,138
<i>The future of Asgard was secure.</i>

1511
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:50,851
<i>Speaking of futures,
I was forging one of my own...</i>

1512
01:45:51,018 --> 01:45:52,477
<i>now that my body's grown back...</i>

1513
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:55,564
<i>with a dude I met called Dwayne.</i>

1514
01:45:57,191 --> 01:45:58,817
<i>And what about Thor, you ask?</i>

1515
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:01,528
<i>He embarked on a new journey...</i>

1516
01:46:01,695 --> 01:46:06,074
<i>because he had found something to live for,
something to love for.</i>

1517
01:46:06,241 --> 01:46:10,746
<i>A little someone who turned him
from Sad God into Dad God.</i>

1518
01:46:10,913 --> 01:46:12,080
Breakfast is served.

1519
01:46:13,582 --> 01:46:15,542
Hello. There you go.

1520
01:46:15,709 --> 01:46:17,669
Hey. Breakfast.

1521
01:46:18,086 --> 01:46:20,589
Excuse me.
What is that?

1522
01:46:20,756 --> 01:46:22,591
They're pan-flaps. From Earth.

1523
01:46:22,758 --> 01:46:24,593
I don't think I like pan-flaps.

1524
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:25,960
- You love them.
- No, I don't.

1525
01:46:26,011 --> 01:46:27,891
- Yes, you do.
- I've never had that in my life.

1526
01:46:28,013 --> 01:46:29,699
Come on. Eat up. We have to go.
We're gonna be late.

1527
01:46:29,723 --> 01:46:30,723
Now where are your boots?

1528
01:46:30,891 --> 01:46:32,851
I'm wearing them.

1529
01:46:33,185 --> 01:46:34,353
You're not wearing those.

1530
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,104
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1531
01:46:36,271 --> 01:46:37,439
Yes, I am.

1532
01:46:37,606 --> 01:46:38,649
No. You're not.

1533
01:46:38,815 --> 01:46:39,983
Go to hell, demon!

1534
01:46:41,902 --> 01:46:42,902
Wow!

1535
01:46:43,237 --> 01:46:45,906
Brand new, now destroyed.
Thank you very much.

1536
01:46:46,073 --> 01:46:47,908
You know what? You wear what you want.

1537
01:46:48,075 --> 01:46:50,053
Don't come complaining to me
when your feet get sore, all right?

1538
01:46:50,077 --> 01:46:51,828
You'll get no sympathy here from me.

1539
01:46:52,037 --> 01:46:54,248
Fine, I'll wear the boots.

1540
01:46:54,414 --> 01:46:55,414
Thank you.

1541
01:46:55,457 --> 01:46:57,209
Remember what my mother used to tell me.

1542
01:46:57,376 --> 01:46:58,416
Listen to the grown-ups...

1543
01:46:58,544 --> 01:47:00,587
and if you see anyone scared
or being picked on...

1544
01:47:00,754 --> 01:47:02,154
- you look after them, okay?
- Okay.

1545
01:47:02,256 --> 01:47:03,632
And most of all, have fun.

1546
01:47:03,799 --> 01:47:05,342
- Gotcha.
- Gotcha.

1547
01:47:05,509 --> 01:47:07,511
Now where is Mjolnir?
Where did I put him?

1548
01:47:07,678 --> 01:47:08,958
Over there. Sleeping in the bed.

1549
01:47:09,012 --> 01:47:10,180
In the bed.

1550
01:47:11,765 --> 01:47:12,766
Oh, wow.

1551
01:47:15,227 --> 01:47:17,020
That is not coming off.

1552
01:47:17,771 --> 01:47:19,189
What did you do?

1553
01:47:19,356 --> 01:47:21,275
She looked boring before.

1554
01:47:22,359 --> 01:47:23,861
Yeah. Suppose it did.

1555
01:47:24,027 --> 01:47:25,028
I love it.

1556
01:47:25,362 --> 01:47:26,572
Very creative.

1557
01:47:30,742 --> 01:47:31,742
Okay.

1558
01:47:32,369 --> 01:47:33,721
Now, you see the aliens down there?

1559
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:35,956
- The stripy ones?
- They look nice.

1560
01:47:36,123 --> 01:47:38,059
Yeah, they are nice.
That's why we have to look after them.

1561
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:39,918
Got it. Protect the nice ones.

1562
01:47:41,044 --> 01:47:42,045
I love you, sweetie.

1563
01:47:42,212 --> 01:47:43,463
Love you, Uncle Thor.

1564
01:47:46,466 --> 01:47:47,968
<i>They will always be there for us.</i>

1565
01:47:48,135 --> 01:47:51,305
<i>The Space Viking
and his girl, born from Eternity.</i>

1566
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:53,807
<i>With the powers of a god.</i>

1567
01:47:56,268 --> 01:47:57,895
<i>Two warriors...</i>

1568
01:47:58,061 --> 01:48:01,190
<i>fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.</i>

1569
01:48:06,862 --> 01:48:10,490
<i>They have traveled far,
and have been given many names.</i>

1570
01:48:11,158 --> 01:48:13,577
<i>But to those who know them best...</i>

1571
01:48:13,744 --> 01:48:15,412
<i>they are simply known...</i>

1572
01:48:15,579 --> 01:48:17,581
<i>as Love and Thunder.</i>

1573
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:09,443
It used to be that being a god,
it meant something.

1574
01:50:11,236 --> 01:50:13,280
People would whisper your name...

1575
01:50:13,864 --> 01:50:17,784
before sharing
their deepest hopes and dreams.

1576
01:50:18,869 --> 01:50:21,205
They begged you for mercy...

1577
01:50:21,872 --> 01:50:24,625
without ever knowing if you were
actually listening.

1578
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:27,961
Now...

1579
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:30,589
you know, they look to the sky...

1580
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:33,634
they don't ask us for lightning.

1581
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:36,637
They don't ask us for rain.

1582
01:50:37,346 --> 01:50:41,683
They just want to see
one of their so-called superheroes.

1583
01:50:44,978 --> 01:50:47,356
When did we become the joke?

1584
01:50:50,442 --> 01:50:51,693
No.

1585
01:50:52,653 --> 01:50:54,112
No more.

1586
01:50:55,656 --> 01:50:58,242
They will fear us again...

1587
01:50:58,742 --> 01:51:01,703
when Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

1588
01:51:04,957 --> 01:51:07,835
Do you understand me, Hercules?

1589
01:51:08,335 --> 01:51:10,754
Do you understand me, my son?

1590
01:51:11,046 --> 01:51:12,464
Yes, Father.

1591
01:57:59,955 --> 01:58:00,955
What?

1592
01:58:02,541 --> 01:58:03,667
Hey.

1593
01:58:05,043 --> 01:58:06,545
Jane Foster.

1594
01:58:07,421 --> 01:58:08,964
Heimdall.

1595
01:58:09,423 --> 01:58:10,799
I see you're dead now.

1596
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:12,801
Yeah.

1597
01:58:13,427 --> 01:58:15,429
Thank you for looking after my son.

1598
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:18,807
You are very welcome here,
to the land of the gods.

1599
01:58:23,562 --> 01:58:25,314
Welcome to Valhalla.

1599
01:58:26,305 --> 01:59:26,401
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
