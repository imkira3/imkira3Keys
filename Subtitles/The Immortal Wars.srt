2
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:07,148
During the
human wars many people died,

3
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,583
if it was the Ukranians creating
a virus to wipe out Russia

4
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:13,649
or the U.S. Setting off
nuclear weapons to Iraq

5
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:14,784
very few humans survived.

6
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:19,214
After the wars, governments
fell and civilians took over,

7
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:20,748
creating their own leaders.

8
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,515
Only 10 countries remained
and divided up the world.

9
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:26,481
Those countries were
collectively known as sectors.

10
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:28,214
The U.S. Sector grew
to be the biggest

11
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:29,750
and most powerful of them all.

12
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,413
But humans are not the only
ones who walk this planet.

13
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:36,147
Deviants are also living
throughout the sectors,

14
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:38,014
hidden and trying to stay alive.

15
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:40,246
I am one of them and
like many others I fight

16
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:43,414
against those who want to rid
the planet of the gifted ones.

17
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:55,211
It began with the civil
battles where humans

18
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,813
would control our
powers with UV charges.

19
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:02,244
Each year humans capture
and torture Deviants.

20
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:04,012
They then force them to
fight and kill each other

21
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,111
to find their vanquisher.

22
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:07,944
The one that would
represent their Sector

23
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:11,578
at the main tournament
Dominion's Battle.

24
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:44,869
Dominion's Battle,
an event created

25
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,170
by madman Dominion Harvey.

26
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,601
He runs and operates
The Immortal Wars,

27
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:52,202
a television show aired
to the entire world.

28
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:54,669
This fight is held by the
U.S. and it has become

29
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,801
the world's biggest
entertainment corporation.

30
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:59,436
Humans wait all
year for this day.

31
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,800
These are dark days and
the darkest of them all

32
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:14,535
is when the world will
watch us fight to the death.

33
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,368
That's not the one.

34
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:27,161
Bag her up, let's take her.

35
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,493
Hey.

36
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:58,360
You are a vanquisher?

37
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:23,951
Can you make sure the
guards have these things

38
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:24,719
fully charged at all times.

39
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:29,418
I still don't know
why we use these things.

40
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,349
What are you, brain dead?

41
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,315
These UV rays are the only
thing keeping your ass alive.

42
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:37,916
Without these we'd
lose all control.

43
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:39,618
Little obsessive,
don't you think?

44
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:44,683
Did you develop a
soft spot for the skags?

45
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:49,617
You're old, Costa,
and you're weak.

46
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,381
Maybe that's why you've
been making all those

47
00:07:52,383 --> 00:07:53,750
little mistakes in the field.

48
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,080
Like I said, that
was out of my control.

49
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:59,315
Yeah, but it was still
your team though, wasn't it?

50
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:05,146
I can't wait to see what Dominion
has to say about all this.

51
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:07,448
Considering you're number
one on his shit list now.

52
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:16,112
Sir, they're asking for you.

53
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:16,781
Have fun.

54
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:20,535
Move.

55
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,535
What is this place?

56
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,602
Well it looks like
a jail, doesn't it?

57
00:10:23,604 --> 00:10:25,234
Now move, skag.

58
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:28,434
No, you've got
to tell me what's...

59
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:33,669
You wanna try again?

60
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:35,703
This is your home now.

61
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,568
You better get real comfy, skag.

62
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,434
Sir.

63
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:58,565
What is it?

64
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,100
You requested my presence.

65
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,465
Sir, I apologize for my mistake.

66
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,630
Would you like a drink?

67
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:13,763
No, I'm fine thank you.

68
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:16,230
So what happened today?

69
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:18,395
It was a small
mistake, my guys they...

70
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:20,531
Ah ah, get one thing straight.

71
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:22,332
These are my guys.

72
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:26,395
They didn't secure the Deviant
correctly and it escaped.

73
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:28,963
So a group of highly
trained guards made a mistake

74
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:31,862
that gave my Deviant
the chance to escape.

75
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:34,062
A mistake that
risked everything.

76
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:37,096
My Sector, my network my show.

77
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:39,962
Sir I apologize.

78
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:42,794
Son, how long have you
been fighting for us?

79
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:44,694
Since I was valid.

80
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:45,462
Which is?

81
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,163
Six years.

82
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:49,729
You know mistakes
can never happen.

83
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:53,026
There's no time for them.

84
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:56,127
Yes sir and I promise it
will never happen again.

85
00:11:57,595 --> 00:12:00,028
It will never happen again.

86
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:07,492
Guards, can you please
take the trash out.

87
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,792
What trash?

88
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:30,059
Did you hear?

89
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:32,923
Costa expired this morning.

90
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:33,692
How?

91
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:38,690
They said he shot
himself right in the head.

92
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,957
That's bullshit.

93
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,658
They got him for
what his team did.

94
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:44,188
You serious?

95
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,691
Yeah, you think there's
time for mistakes?

96
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,655
No but hey that just give
us a chance to move up.

97
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:53,591
I'm okay with that.

98
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:56,156
Right.

99
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,720
Hey you think the
game's gonna be as brutal

100
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:07,988
this year as last year?

101
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,154
They can all kill each
other for all I care.

102
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:14,555
As long as they're
not on our streets.

103
00:13:43,752 --> 00:13:45,152
What's wrong with you?

104
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,751
How did a girl like
you make it this far?

105
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:55,049
It's not my choice to
be here, they forced me.

106
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,051
We all were.

107
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:02,648
So tell me your story.

108
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,584
How'd you end up here?

109
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:08,983
There is no story, I
wasn't supposed to be here.

110
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,717
I'm tired of fighting.

111
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:17,983
But I will do what I
have to do to survive.

112
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,082
I just want to be free and
live the life I have left.

113
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,148
Yeah me too.

114
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:31,746
L talk to me.

115
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:32,979
We're good.

116
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:34,179
How good?

117
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,880
We're broadcasting
to all Sectors.

118
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:38,178
Russia, Africa, Mexico
each one's ready for us.

119
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,412
That's why I love you.

120
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:42,113
Now time to greet
our special guests.

121
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:07,612
What will you do when
we're in front of the world?

122
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,709
I won't fight you.

123
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:17,511
When the time comes I will
fight you and I will win.

124
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,177
You think you
can beat Nyx Moros?

125
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:24,276
You ask as if it's
going to be hard.

126
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:28,908
She is a monster, a murderer.

127
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,443
She killed her own brother
for this sick game.

128
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,710
The god of Deserts and storms.

129
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:46,907
I told you, you can't win.

130
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:48,274
I'm stronger than you.

131
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:58,673
No you're wrong.

132
00:15:58,675 --> 00:15:59,675
I'm stronger.

133
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:07,972
But I couldn't
hurt my own family.

134
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:21,169
You see that's the
difference between you and I.

135
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:25,638
When we were forced
into this, this game,

136
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:30,902
I put to side the fact
that you were my brother,

137
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:35,338
and I made you my enemy.

138
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:50,069
This is the end,
you ready to die?

139
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:53,369
We both know this
isn't the end of me.

140
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,335
Give them what they want.

141
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,631
Seth was one of the strongest
deviants known to man.

142
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:30,597
Nothing will stop her
from killing anyone

143
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,464
who gets in her way.

144
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:34,332
Maybe this will.

145
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:39,063
This place is
surrounded by UV lines.

146
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:41,732
We can't use any of our
powers, they control it all.

147
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:45,031
So tell me about yourself.

148
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,094
We are going to be
here for a while,

149
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:51,465
might as well know a little
bit about my next victim.

150
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,630
I'm just messing around.

151
00:17:57,831 --> 00:18:01,996
Well, I was seven when
my family found out.

152
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,595
Found out what?

153
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:06,861
What I am.

154
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:12,626
They grew hatred towards me,
so I ran away and started over.

155
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:15,362
I then began to fight for
those who needed help.

156
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:22,261
But then when I found out
what I was capable of I got...

157
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,092
You okay?

158
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:41,058
So what's your name?

159
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,726
Olive, Olive Summerlin.

160
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:48,225
No, I meant what
do they call you?

161
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:51,626
What do they call you?

162
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:55,192
Oh uh, Trikalypse.

163
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:58,492
Cool.

164
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:00,955
You?

165
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:02,124
Iro.

166
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:04,692
Cool.

167
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:07,117
How about something to eat?

168
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,983
How about something to eat?

169
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:11,152
Maybe, skag.

170
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,685
I said maybe, skag.

171
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:25,083
Maybe you oughta come
into this cell, huh?

172
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,117
You know what?

173
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,247
That sounds like a good idea.

174
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:31,114
Really?

175
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:32,315
- Come on.
- You know what they say.

176
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:33,948
Once you go black,
they never come back.

177
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,916
Maybe next time princess.

178
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:36,683
I want something to eat!

179
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,082
What does that do?

180
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:46,281
It scans the body, it records
strength, power, health.

181
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:48,449
It's how they know who to pair
us up with for each fight.

182
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,214
How do you know all this?

183
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,113
I knew I would
be here some day.

184
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:00,314
I looked into everything.

185
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:08,178
I did my research
and prepared myself.

186
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,947
Step forward skag.

187
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,178
She thought that
you were me, huh?

188
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,478
Step forward
for evaluation!

189
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,077
Hey I'm sorry, I
didn't hear you there.

190
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,012
You can try to keep us in here,

191
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,413
but it ain't gonna
work, you know why?

192
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:25,544
There's a revolution
coming, brother.

193
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:29,243
I'm gonna make sure your
black ass dies first.

194
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:30,142
I'd love to see that.

195
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:32,009
You will see that.

196
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:33,342
See if you can
get your power off

197
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:35,579
before I put two hollow
points between your eyes.

198
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:56,543
Gentlemen, for years the
world has been divided.

199
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,643
Rich and poor, strong and weak.

200
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:04,309
And the question is which
category do you fall into?

201
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:09,406
As we witnessed, the
last year of the feathers

202
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,206
the Phoenix rose to be the
Victor and as we all know

203
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,941
this is the age of the snake.

204
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:22,574
Every 365 days we work hard
and prepare for today's events.

205
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:28,071
The day our people come together
and watch how we're making

206
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:29,274
the world a better place.

207
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:34,671
Now it's time to reveal
which serpent will represent

208
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:35,936
your sector at the table.

209
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,373
France we'll begin with you.

210
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:41,173
The Black Mumba.

211
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:44,272

00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,272

00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:05,404
The Nightingale adder.

218
00:23:06,837 --> 00:23:07,670
The Copperhead.

219
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:12,302
The Blue krait.

220
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:21,600
Russia.

221
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:23,402
The Emerald boa.

222
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,368
The King Cobra.

223
00:23:34,802 --> 00:23:36,467
Who will be
victorious this year?

224
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:46,634

and telepathically
communicate with her partner.

235
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:27,294
What a child.

236
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:30,196
The Tank generates
superhuman strength.

237
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:35,227
Aiolos, Ukraine,

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,226

Trikalypse, United States,

00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:15,492
ability to absorb powers
with body contact.

248
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:21,626
I take it we have all
selected our battle grounds?

249
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,823
The time for entry is now,

250
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:36,056
please proceed to
cell block four.

251
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,019
They say she's a god.

252
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,153
They say Nyx Moros
is an Egyptian god.

253
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:38,485
How else do you think she
was able to kill Seth?

254
00:27:17,947 --> 00:27:18,981
Looks good.

255
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:23,713
I take it this
is for the show.

256
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:24,947
We are the stars.

257
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,680
So what happens next?

258
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:44,344
Well now that they
have scanned us.

259
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:46,844
They are going to ranks
us one through 10.

260
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:49,212
That will then determine
who we fight first.

261
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:52,446
Then what happens after that?

262
00:27:53,944 --> 00:27:56,777
Right now we are all going to
be visited by 10 individuals.

263
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,345
The ones who brought us here.

264
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:01,445
Then they will
register us for entry.

265
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:03,978
Then it begins.

266
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:07,842
We will be hit by the
shrill three times.

267
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:09,377
We will be to weak to stand.

268
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:14,709
And then we'll be announced
to the world of who we are

269
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:16,511
and what we can do.

270
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:24,375
Then the final 24 hours of
our lives begin to count down.

271
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:19,536
Get me the hell out of here!

272
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:23,435
Haven't you noticed
you're surrounded by steel?

273
00:29:23,437 --> 00:29:25,968
You could have escaped
by now if you wanted to.

274
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,604
But no, here you are caged.

275
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,168
Why is that?

276
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,200
Nowhere to go,
nothing to return to.

277
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:39,501
Let's get something
perfectly straight right now.

278
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,069
This is your life now.

279
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,734
You have nowhere else to go.

280
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:47,100
This is not my life, this
was a diversion, a distraction.

281
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:49,566
All I have to do
now is just sit back

282
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:51,301
and watch it crumble around you.

283
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:56,166
Better yet, I'll listen to
the distraction carry on.

284
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:59,601
I am done fighting for you.

285
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:01,334
Game over!

286
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,000
You've clearly lost your mind.

287
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:23,599
Dominion didn't come.

288
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,830
You're registered
automatically.

289
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:29,930
You actually think
he'll come down here?

290
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,663
What are they
going to do to him?

291
00:30:53,095 --> 00:30:55,496
They're taking him
down to cell block one.

292
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:05,894
What's in cell block one?

293
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,459
Cell block one is no
cell block its more like

294
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:17,158
the sewers chambers.

295
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,225
A dark hall that
not even a speck

296
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:20,594
of sunlight will ever shine.

297
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:24,525
Its said that Dominion throws
any deviant that does not obey

298
00:31:24,527 --> 00:31:29,224
his laws and for those who
cannot take captivity well.

299
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:33,290
They are only fed medications
that slowly kill them.

300
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:35,824
They say some of
them are also used

301
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:37,626
for genetic experimentations.

302
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,922
Leo.

303
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,522
Who is he?

304
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:23,321
Our replacement.

305
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:26,053
He replaces us if any one of us

306
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:27,655
does not make it
to registration.

307
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:30,654
Think of it as him
being on standby.

308
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:35,286
They announced him months
before the civil battles.

309
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:50,520
And we are locked in.

310
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,619
We are locked and ready to go.

311
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:02,052
Gentlemen, it
is now show time.

312
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:05,984
May the strongest win.

313
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,584
Okay we are in, In 54...

314
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:28,980
Hello citizens of the world.

315
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:30,547
It Is that time
of the age again.

316
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:33,147
The time all our hard
work and dedication

317
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:35,646
will be put to the test.

318
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:38,346
In years past we have witnessed
some heartfelt moments.

319
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:40,880
- Hey it's starting, come on.
- We have watched some of

320
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:42,346
the greatest succeed
and some fail.

321
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:45,382
But this year it will
be one for the books.

322
00:33:46,648 --> 00:33:50,080
In my hand I have the list
of the Immortal Wars VQ's.

323
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:54,445
Now I don't know about you,
but I am beyond excited

324
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:55,947
for this year's selections.

325
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,877
I've even heard that this year
one of the strongest Deviants

326
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:03,246
ever recorded in history.

327
00:34:04,848 --> 00:34:05,912
Now let us begin.

328
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:13,045
First up we have The Charge
with a rank of a five.

329
00:34:14,412 --> 00:34:17,479
Next we have Atmo
ranked at a six.

330
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:21,345
England's Leo ranked
with a number seven.

331
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:27,008
Karly and The Tank ranked
together at a seven.

332
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,875
Sin is also a seven.

333
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:32,743
Iro ranked at an eight.

334
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:35,475
Aiolos with a rank of an eight.

335
00:34:35,477 --> 00:34:38,608
Blackout ranked at an eight.

336
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,410
Dekay ranked at a nine.

337
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:47,942
And finally last but not least,
Trikalypse ranked at a 10.

338
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:58,307
Now I know this has never
happened before in the ages

339
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:01,141
of the Immortal Wars, but
this is history in the making.

340
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:07,905
So on behalf of the city of
Lambent, let the battles begin.

341
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:09,039
My moneys on the US.

342
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,806
No India's got it,
she looks ruthless.

343
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,906
$100 down for the US
make it the third round.

344
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:18,841
This years going
to a good year, huh?

345
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:20,073
Yes it is.

346
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:26,339
Wait she was right.

347
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:29,370
Weakest versus strongest.

348
00:35:29,372 --> 00:35:32,771
Eliminate the weak
so the strong have to

349
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:34,139
fight against each other.

350
00:35:35,205 --> 00:35:36,638
It will make for a great show.

351
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:40,570
How do you know all this?

352
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,435
Like I said I did my research.

353
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:44,902
Research gives you
only so much information,

354
00:35:44,904 --> 00:35:46,038
you know everything.

355
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:57,471
When you said that you
knew you would be here,

356
00:35:58,637 --> 00:36:02,936
you actually meant you wanted
to be here, am I right?

357
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:12,235
You're right, I
chose to be here.

358
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:23,232
My mother was killed
five years ago

359
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:25,067
at the 10th age Immortal Wars.

360
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:30,200
She didn't make it
past the second round.

361
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:34,864
She was in contact
with my father

362
00:36:34,866 --> 00:36:36,433
through one of
Dominion's slaves.

363
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:41,863
But Dominion found
out and had her killed

364
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:43,965
as well as my father soon after.

365
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:48,998
But not before he
told me everything.

366
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:55,262
That's why I'm here.

367
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:57,995
Dominion will pay
for what he has done

368
00:36:57,997 --> 00:36:59,962
and nothing's gonna stop me.

369
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:02,029
That's not the
job for one person.

370
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:05,994
It's bigger than you, it's
bigger than both of us.

371
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:07,994
It's not one man that
needs to be stopped,

372
00:37:07,996 --> 00:37:09,230
it's the whole government.

373
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:12,564
We've been forced to
forget what peace is.

374
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,497
Then what do we do?

375
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:23,462
We play, we fight,
and we survive.

376
00:37:25,096 --> 00:37:26,862
But we don't entertain.

377
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,893
Five man.

378
00:37:57,892 --> 00:38:00,858
Oy, what makes you
so special huh?

379
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:08,958
How about you come in
here and I can show you.

380
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:15,425
I mean it, let me show you.

381
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:22,556
Tempting, however
let's bring our romance

382
00:38:22,558 --> 00:38:23,457
to the battlefield.

383
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:39,223
Hi, what's your name?

384
00:38:51,189 --> 00:38:55,621
I'm Karly, this is The Tank.

385
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:11,079
How is our leading lady doing?

386
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:14,813
Well since you
asked quite excited.

387
00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:17,178
I was able to get a
glimpse of the top 10.

388
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,279
I hope you weren't
disappointed.

389
00:40:19,281 --> 00:40:24,246
No, so when I win the
final round what happens?

390
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:29,344
You will receive your awards.

391
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:30,112
Which are?

392
00:40:30,878 --> 00:40:32,979
Power, freedom.

393
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,279
Then lets get
this thing started.

394
00:40:40,678 --> 00:40:42,242
Well citizens it is time.

395
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:44,344
Please stop what you
are doing and join us

396
00:40:44,346 --> 00:40:47,042
in this new age of
the Immortal Wars.

397
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,142
Our representatives
have been matched

398
00:40:49,144 --> 00:40:51,578
and first up we have
Leo Versus Black.

399
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:54,542
Now this will Germany's
strongest fighter

400
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:55,941
since about two years ago.

401
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:58,209
They have had some rough times.

402
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:00,974
England, on the other
hand, has dominated.

403
00:41:00,976 --> 00:41:04,408
However, they have had to
remove their primary fighter

404
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,940
due to medical reasons.

405
00:41:05,942 --> 00:41:09,675
Leo has been selected
to fill those shoes.

406
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:11,209
Okay lets bring up the lights.

407
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:16,074
Environment bring up the sound.

408
00:41:16,076 --> 00:41:18,673
Easy, easy, easy, nice and slow.

409
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:21,276
And, go.

410
00:41:43,006 --> 00:41:45,406
So are you ready?

411
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,073
Are you?

412
00:41:54,672 --> 00:41:56,272
A great way to start the show.

413
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:00,470
Good one.

414
00:42:15,237 --> 00:42:16,169
How was that?

415
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:19,070
You shouldn't have done that.

416
00:43:00,366 --> 00:43:02,400
Now that's the
way to start a show!

417
00:43:11,398 --> 00:43:12,697
Who will be next?

418
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:13,899
Stay tuned after
this quick break.

419
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:38,729
Tank I don't want to die.

420
00:43:38,731 --> 00:43:39,497
This is wrong.

421
00:43:40,896 --> 00:43:42,161
How do we even have a
chance against each other

422
00:43:42,163 --> 00:43:44,862
if they make us so
weak before each fight.

423
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:47,060
Before each fight
they're going to

424
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:48,928
inject us with UV Charges.

425
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:54,360
It's a small dose but enough
to spike up our energy,

426
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:55,395
powers, strength.

427
00:43:56,861 --> 00:43:59,925
The next couple of fights
are going to go by fast.

428
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:01,693
They're gonna save
the strongest for last

429
00:44:01,695 --> 00:44:04,925
and get rid of the weak first.

430
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:08,227
Then it will be us
against each other.

431
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,060
Who's next?

432
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,891
The kid.

433
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:52,974
They say you're a nine, huh?

434
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:58,937
I've seen better.

435
00:47:58,939 --> 00:48:00,206
Watch this.

436
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:04,772
You really need
to be working more

437
00:48:04,774 --> 00:48:06,906
on your fighting skills.

438
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,571
Like that?

439
00:48:15,573 --> 00:48:19,439
Yeah, like that.

440
00:49:08,669 --> 00:49:09,568
Watch this.

441
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:14,534
Is this what you
wanted to see, huh?

442
00:49:15,634 --> 00:49:18,867
Is this what you wanted to see?

443
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:01,563
Tighter Tank, squeeze tighter.

444
00:50:21,763 --> 00:50:22,794
Please don't make me do this.

445
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:27,126
For being a 10 you're
really are not that strong.

446
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:27,960
Please.

447
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,760
I don't want to fight her!

448
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:36,327
But I will for freedom.

449
00:50:44,394 --> 00:50:45,227
And so will I.

450
00:50:51,493 --> 00:50:52,325
Yikes.

451
00:50:53,225 --> 00:50:54,392
She got him.

452
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,789
I'm sorry.

453
00:51:59,553 --> 00:52:00,353
Tank!

454
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,284
Tank, get up.

455
00:52:06,286 --> 00:52:07,386
Please get up.

456
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:45,948
Well that was a
very rough round.

457
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,782
But that is what
this game is about.

458
00:52:50,882 --> 00:52:54,115
The display of
strength and power.

459
00:52:56,315 --> 00:52:59,878
I gotta say did you all
see that coming from Iro?

460
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,779
It's like she couldn't
take the beating anymore

461
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:03,315
and just snapped!

462
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:08,178
Well now is the time
to get more drinks,

463
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,278
serve yourself up
with some more grub,

464
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,411
pay for your losses and
collect on your winnings,

465
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:15,579
because we have the
quarter finals coming

466
00:53:15,581 --> 00:53:17,011
right after these messages.

467
00:53:17,013 --> 00:53:20,146
We will be right back with
some more Immortal Wars.

468
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,704
I killed her kids.

469
00:54:38,706 --> 00:54:39,473
I Killed three children.

470
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:04,069
Make me live.

471
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,837
Yes sir.

472
00:55:09,237 --> 00:55:10,069
You're in.

473
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:18,934
Hello representatives
this is Dominion Harvey.

474
00:55:18,936 --> 00:55:21,234
I wanted to congratulate
you all for making it

475
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:21,901
to the next round.

476
00:55:22,835 --> 00:55:25,002
And take the time
to share something.

477
00:55:25,968 --> 00:55:28,867
The one thing we all
have in common is death,

478
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:31,835
the only difference
is how it happens.

479
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:35,468
Your lives are not yours
anymore, they belong to me.

480
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:42,331
Do what you were born
to do fight, kill, die

481
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,900
and your passing
will be one of honor.

482
00:55:46,933 --> 00:55:50,164
Now, If you withstand my
wishes, I promise you agony

483
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:52,898
in the lights that you never
could envision conceivable.

484
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:55,299
Thank you.

485
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:02,532
What do we do
now, he's on to us?

486
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:09,165
We continue to play his game.

487
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:21,729
Gentlemen that was a pretty
entertaining round wasn't it?

488
00:56:21,731 --> 00:56:23,097
Russia what happened?

489
00:56:24,397 --> 00:56:25,497
I was rooting for you.

490
00:56:27,663 --> 00:56:29,760
I thought I made
it clear to you all

491
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:32,094
you had to have entered
your strongest fighter.

492
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:33,227
All I see here is a group
of scared creatures,

493
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:34,827
Lets see if the
final five can make

494
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:36,827
the next round more superior.

495
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:41,961
If not there will be some
extreme changes to come.

496
00:56:43,562 --> 00:56:44,395
Are you with me?

497
00:56:46,262 --> 00:56:47,095
Good.

498
00:57:27,225 --> 00:57:29,922
How many times have
I told you not to do that?

499
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:33,157
Just play like
normal kids, okay?

500
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:52,522
What are they doing?

501
00:57:54,656 --> 00:57:55,489
I don't know.

502
00:57:58,555 --> 00:58:00,288
2, 3, it's even now.

503
00:58:00,954 --> 00:58:02,122
What do you mean?

504
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:05,152
Well, now that
they took Blackout,

505
00:58:05,154 --> 00:58:07,353
there's an even
number of fighters.

506
00:58:07,355 --> 00:58:08,986
You're right.

507
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:10,153
What are they up to?

508
00:58:14,054 --> 00:58:18,285
So, how's everything looking?

509
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:21,051
We did have some interference
from an unknown signal

510
00:58:21,053 --> 00:58:25,718
but I took care of it,
other than that we are good.

511
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,017
All perished deviants
have been transferred

512
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:29,783
to cell block two
and we're just about

513
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:31,484
ready for the quarter finals.

514
00:58:31,486 --> 00:58:32,783
Great.

515
00:58:32,785 --> 00:58:34,916
What environments
do we have left?

516
00:58:34,918 --> 00:58:40,051
Let's see, Death
Lands, Forest of Ice,

517
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:42,918
and the streets of Lambent.

518
00:58:49,017 --> 00:58:50,517
This round should be good.

519
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:02,615
What if they make
us fight each other?

520
00:59:02,617 --> 00:59:04,114
They won't.

521
00:59:04,116 --> 00:59:06,348
They're going to put
me against Dekay.

522
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:07,183
We are both the strongest.

523
00:59:08,383 --> 00:59:12,280
He's a business man, he'll
put us together last.

524
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:15,448
He knows we're friends,
it'll make good TV.

525
00:59:18,148 --> 00:59:21,249
And when that time
comes we strike.

526
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:49,279
Okay, you've got this.

527
00:59:52,211 --> 00:59:54,079
You got this, Olive.

528
01:00:07,411 --> 01:00:08,944
No, me, take me!

529
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:11,408
I'm fighting her!

530
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,177
Iro!

531
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:17,374
Take me!

532
01:00:17,376 --> 01:00:18,343
Olive.

533
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:28,903
This is all out
of our control.

534
01:01:33,302 --> 01:01:35,401
I can't fight.

535
01:01:35,403 --> 01:01:36,170
You're going to have to.

536
01:01:37,136 --> 01:01:39,733
No don't make
me give them that.

537
01:01:39,735 --> 01:01:41,236
I won't fight you!

538
01:01:42,935 --> 01:01:44,367
You think I want to die?

539
01:01:44,369 --> 01:01:45,301
Huh?

540
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:49,701
I don't stand a
chance against you!

541
01:01:49,703 --> 01:01:51,299
I am walking into my own grave

542
01:01:51,301 --> 01:01:53,435
when I go into that
battle ground with you!

543
01:03:35,226 --> 01:03:36,059
Nice shots.

544
01:03:42,892 --> 01:03:47,425
Nice try, now it's my turn.

545
01:04:21,655 --> 01:04:23,553
You're a tough one aren't you?

546
01:04:23,555 --> 01:04:24,388
You have no idea.

547
01:04:33,187 --> 01:04:36,054
You actually thought you
could beat me, didn't you?

548
01:04:43,654 --> 01:04:45,886
Tell me, how were you
going to defeat Nyx

549
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:48,420
if even I am to much for you?

550
01:04:51,485 --> 01:04:53,152
I never wanted Nyx.

551
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:11,451
Tell me.

552
01:05:13,518 --> 01:05:15,450
If not Nyx, then who?

553
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:18,315
Dominion.

554
01:05:18,317 --> 01:05:22,217
But if you get in my
way I'll kill you too.

555
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:31,050
That's it.

556
01:06:09,546 --> 01:06:11,046
Taste your power.

557
01:07:43,471 --> 01:07:45,834
What did you do to her?

558
01:07:45,836 --> 01:07:47,103
What we are here for?

559
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,438
Crazy bitch.

560
01:08:11,335 --> 01:08:15,500
What I did I did to
be free and now I'm

561
01:08:15,502 --> 01:08:16,834
just one steps ahead of you.

562
01:08:18,202 --> 01:08:21,234
I suggest you do
the same, survive.

563
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:27,900
Because I can't wait to
have the chance to kill you.

564
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,931
Now that is what
I'm talking about!

565
01:08:39,933 --> 01:08:41,697
That was amazing.

566
01:08:41,699 --> 01:08:45,065
Dekay has no remorse
she's a killer.

567
01:08:46,365 --> 01:08:47,696
I want to fight her.

568
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:50,132
Well, well now we still
have two more fights.

569
01:09:16,564 --> 01:09:17,397
You make sure you
win this one got it?

570
01:09:38,461 --> 01:09:39,826
I'm not fighting you.

571
01:09:41,662 --> 01:09:42,894
Oh really?

572
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:44,361
Is that right?

573
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:49,292
You know they won't let
you just walk out of here.

574
01:09:49,294 --> 01:09:50,194
You have to fight.

575
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:53,159
I will not.

576
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,757
Did you hear that?

577
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:57,926
I will not fight anymore!

578
01:10:01,293 --> 01:10:02,226
Did she just do that?

579
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,992
Take care of this.

580
01:10:17,823 --> 01:10:21,155
I told you I don't
want to fight any more.

581
01:10:21,157 --> 01:10:22,357
There you go.

582
01:10:51,388 --> 01:10:52,221
Why are you smiling?

583
01:10:52,921 --> 01:10:54,787
Please, don't do this.

584
01:10:55,488 --> 01:10:58,188
Win, you have to survive.

585
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:00,553
Make Dominion pay.

586
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:02,186
Please.

587
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:02,920
You got this.

588
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,051
You're forcing me to do this.

589
01:11:32,518 --> 01:11:33,350
Do it.

590
01:12:03,415 --> 01:12:04,315
What is she doing?

591
01:12:36,812 --> 01:12:38,079
Cut it, cut it now.

592
01:12:41,912 --> 01:12:44,810
It looks like she checked
if he was still alive.

593
01:12:49,678 --> 01:12:51,509
Is what she did not allowed?

594
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:54,708
What she did made us look bad.

595
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:58,841
What she did shows the world
she is good and she cares.

596
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:01,209
The purpose of these
games are to show

597
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:04,575
that you are all to blame for
what happened to this planet

598
01:13:04,577 --> 01:13:06,310
and that you are all the enemy.

599
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:18,775
That last round
was pretty good.

600
01:13:19,742 --> 01:13:21,874
A bit sad at times,
but overall good.

601
01:13:23,074 --> 01:13:25,139
I bet Harvey has
a boot up his ass.

602
01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:26,042
What do you mean.

603
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:29,540
What that girl Trikalypse did.

604
01:13:29,542 --> 01:13:31,739
I don't think he's
happy about that.

605
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,274
She really made him look bad.

606
01:13:37,107 --> 01:13:40,671
Thank you.

607
01:13:40,673 --> 01:13:42,838
Wait, hold on, is this correct?

608
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,107
Those are the orders.

609
01:13:48,106 --> 01:13:48,939
What is it?

610
01:13:55,906 --> 01:13:58,370
Can you bring up the
sound from the last fight?

611
01:13:58,372 --> 01:13:59,138
Yes sir.

612
01:14:00,338 --> 01:14:02,768
What exactly are
you looking for?

613
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:03,836
They were talking
through out the fight.

614
01:14:03,838 --> 01:14:05,105
I want to know what was said.

615
01:14:06,804 --> 01:14:07,905
Okay here it is.

616
01:14:10,837 --> 01:14:16,435
Win, you have to
survive, make Dominion pay.

617
01:14:16,437 --> 01:14:17,668
Please.

618
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:18,437
You got this.

619
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,802
Make me pay, huh?

620
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:00,699
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

621
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:08,367
I know you won't.

622
01:15:57,295 --> 01:15:59,195
Well, well, well look at us.

623
01:16:00,228 --> 01:16:01,360
The last two standing.

624
01:16:01,362 --> 01:16:03,225
Dekay don't talk.

625
01:16:03,227 --> 01:16:06,626
Come on, after all
we've been through

626
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:09,094
I am glad it is just us left.

627
01:16:14,926 --> 01:16:16,226
This should be good.

628
01:16:17,692 --> 01:16:19,291
This is exciting.

629
01:16:19,293 --> 01:16:20,789
And why is that?

630
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:23,924
Because the entire world
is going to watch me win

631
01:16:23,926 --> 01:16:27,223
and witness the
death of Trikalypse.

632
01:16:27,225 --> 01:16:28,292
Why?

633
01:16:29,758 --> 01:16:30,956
Why are you doing this?

634
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:31,990
Why are you giving them a show?

635
01:16:31,992 --> 01:16:34,190
- We are all the same.
- No.

636
01:16:34,192 --> 01:16:36,058
I am something more.

637
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:40,655
I am something bigger
and more powerful.

638
01:16:40,657 --> 01:16:42,191
Let me show you.

639
01:17:22,287 --> 01:17:23,719
I almost had you.

640
01:17:23,721 --> 01:17:26,285
Your poor little Iro
didn't have it so easy.

641
01:17:26,287 --> 01:17:27,519
Stop this.

642
01:17:27,521 --> 01:17:28,318
You're giving them
what they want.

643
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,285
Isn't that the point?

644
01:17:29,287 --> 01:17:30,220
To give them a show.

645
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:34,518
It's not going to
happen, stop trying.

646
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,552
Oh bitch, you haven't
even seen me try.

647
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:56,882
Can't you see the world
needs some one like me.

648
01:17:56,884 --> 01:17:58,084
Someone who can win.

649
01:18:08,716 --> 01:18:10,780
Attention fighters,
there has been a change

650
01:18:10,782 --> 01:18:12,047
to your orders.

651
01:18:12,049 --> 01:18:14,814
Three fighters
must battle it out

652
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:18,849
for the last available spot.

653
01:18:28,315 --> 01:18:31,913
Here we go.

654
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:35,513
Our viewers are jumping
up by the thousands sir.

655
01:18:35,515 --> 01:18:36,814
Excellent.

656
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,279
He's here to kill us.

657
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,678
No shit.

658
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,248
No this is different.

659
01:18:44,313 --> 01:18:48,113
They did something to
him, he's a puppet.

660
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,113
Once he's dead, we will
finish what we started.

661
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:42,840
They're controlling you!

662
01:19:42,842 --> 01:19:44,042
You can fight this.

663
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:52,372
Just kill me.

664
01:19:52,374 --> 01:19:57,341
I'm sorry.

665
01:20:24,637 --> 01:20:28,068
Can't you see, its
not how strong you are,

666
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:32,803
it's about how you
use your power.

667
01:20:47,534 --> 01:20:49,901
There I win!

668
01:20:51,234 --> 01:20:54,800
Nyx Moros where are you?

669
01:21:11,798 --> 01:21:13,299
This is my show.

670
01:21:37,696 --> 01:21:38,594
What's going on here?

671
01:21:38,596 --> 01:21:40,830
Geeze, sir, I uh...

672
01:21:43,962 --> 01:21:44,796
Did she win?

673
01:21:47,762 --> 01:21:49,393
Yeah, yeah she did.

674
01:21:49,395 --> 01:21:51,562
I've been rooting for
her the whole time.

675
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:53,892
You watch this?

676
01:21:53,894 --> 01:21:55,294
Yeah, who doesn't?

677
01:21:56,861 --> 01:21:57,895
Send me in.

678
01:22:01,527 --> 01:22:03,260
Prepare for the final battle.

679
01:22:04,327 --> 01:22:07,291
Oh and can you have a
round of those drinks

680
01:22:07,293 --> 01:22:09,559
for our guests in the
executive chamber?

681
01:22:09,561 --> 01:22:10,327
Yes sir.

682
01:22:11,095 --> 01:22:12,393
Thank you.

683
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:19,258
Come on, what is this?

684
01:24:07,516 --> 01:24:10,550
Aw! She did put
up a good fight.

685
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,214
That's it! Push it.

686
01:24:26,048 --> 01:24:27,716
Give it all you got.

687
01:24:29,215 --> 01:24:31,414
I'm going to kill you.

688
01:26:12,138 --> 01:26:13,172
Jankins?

689
01:26:14,205 --> 01:26:17,203
What the hell are you doing?

690
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:19,235
It's sad that
you don't see it.

691
01:26:19,237 --> 01:26:22,437
That power you have pointing
at me this very second.

692
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:26,302
What gives us the right
to have it more than them?

693
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,169
What makes us any different?

694
01:26:28,171 --> 01:26:29,337
You're right.

695
01:26:35,072 --> 01:26:36,570
Let's settle this like humans.

696
01:27:46,932 --> 01:27:52,364
Enough, we have to save what
little humanity we have left.

697
01:27:54,964 --> 01:27:58,795
No, there's the different
between me and you, pretty boy.

698
01:28:01,363 --> 01:28:05,760
You'll never have what
it takes to survive.

699
01:28:16,195 --> 01:28:17,728
And it begins.

699
01:28:18,305 --> 01:29:18,754
