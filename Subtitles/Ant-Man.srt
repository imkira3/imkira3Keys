00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,965
Stark!

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,600
He doesn't seem happy.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,045
Hello, Hank.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,370
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,204
I took a detour...

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,408
Through your defense lab.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,481
Tell me that isn't what
I think it is.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,610
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,968
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,565
You were instructed to go to Russia.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,642
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,846
I'm a scientist.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,570
Then act like one.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,240
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,406
Help us put it to good use.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,881
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,883
and now you try to steal my research?

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,284
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,886
Ah...

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,968
Easy, Hank.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,971
You mention my wife again

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,088
and I'll show you ferocity.

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,764
Don't look at me. You said it.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,161
I formally tender my resignation.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,561
We don't accept it. Formally.

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,926
Hank,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,729
we need you.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,121
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,521
Don't let your past determine the future.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,524
As long as I am alive,

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,082
nobody will ever get that formula.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,762
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,047
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,645
Yes.

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,724
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,888
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,840
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,130
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,690
He's no security risk.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,604
Unless we make him one.

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,606
You like that?

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,086
You like that?

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,605
Come get you some now.

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,366
You didn't even move.

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Nah.

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,241
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,281
You see this right here?

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,610
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,523
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,361
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

52
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,408
All right, break it up.

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,801
Break it up! Break it up!

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,206
Scotty!

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,009
What's up, man!

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,565
Damn! Hey.

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,927
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,085
Hey, what's up with your eye?

59
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,243
Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

60
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,209
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,248
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,446
You know what? I'm still the only one
who knocked him out.

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,682
Well, I definitely didn't.

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,765
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

65
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,320
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss
my celly getting out?

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,731
Hey, how's your girl, man?

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,961
Oh, she left me.

68
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,891
- Oh.
- Yeah, my ma died, too.

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,205
And my dad got deported.

70
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,841
But I got the van!

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,445
- It's nice.
- Yeah, right?

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,360
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,687
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

74
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,250
You're gonna be on your feet
in no time. Watch.

75
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,765
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,446
And I gotta introduce you to some
people. Some really skilled people.

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,170
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,561
No, I'm serious, man.
I'm not going back.

79
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,124
I got a daughter to take care of.

80
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,407
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,404
Look, man, I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

82
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,321
I'm gonna be fine.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,960
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

84
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,042
Would you like to try our
Mango Fruit Blast?

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,121
Uh, no, thanks.

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,649
Um, I will have...
I'll have a burger, please.

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,291
Oh, we don't... We don't make that.

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,284
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

89
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,249
It's ice cream.
Baskin-Robbins.

90
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,767
I'll just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

91
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,441
Dude.

92
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,329
Can I see you in the back, chief?
Pronto.

93
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,004
Sure thing, Dale.

94
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,850
Darby, could you just, uh,
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

95
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,809
- Hey, Dale.
- Come on in.

96
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,566
Pull up some chair.

97
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,242
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,526
You found out.

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,841
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

100
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,287
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But I...

101
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,006
No one would hire me.

102
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,526
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,762
Look, I'm sorry.

104
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,330
I don't do it anymore. I just...

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,401
Respect.

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,681
I couldn't be happier about it.

107
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,171
- Really?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,203
Thank you. Thank you.

109
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,851
You really stuck it
to those billionaire SOBs.

110
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,446
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

111
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,046
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?

112
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,202
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

113
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,647
Well, I'm very happy in this job,

114
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,047
and I really just appreciate
the opportunity to...

115
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,565
Well, you're fired, of course.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,365
I can't really keep you on.

117
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,124
Wait, what? Fired?

118
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,281
Yeah.

119
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,362
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

120
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,324
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

121
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,726
I'll tell you what, though.

122
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,963
This will be totally off the books,
off the records,

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,044
but if you want to grab one of those
Mango Fruit Blasts

124
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,451
on your way out the door,

125
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,966
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

126
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,851
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

127
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,129
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

128
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,043
I was. I got fired.

129
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,849
Damn. They find out who you are?

130
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,967
Yeah.

131
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,769
Baskin-Robbins
always finds out, bro.

132
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,763
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

133
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,089
- You want some waffles?
- Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

134
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,611
Oh. That's Kurt.

135
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,000
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

136
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,361
- Nice meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

137
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,287
Who are you?

138
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,721
Dave.

139
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,610
Nice work on the Vista job.

140
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,846
Vista job, yes.

141
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,400
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

142
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,848
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

143
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,651
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

144
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,165
You mean you're a pussy.

145
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,321
Yeah.

146
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,243
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

147
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,765
And it added up to millions.

148
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,729
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

149
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,566
And what does he do?

150
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,563
He hacks into the security system

151
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,325
and transfers millions
back to the people that they stole it from.

152
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,323
Posts all the bank records online.

153
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,049
What are you doing?

155
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,167
Hmm?

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,241
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys?

157
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,606
What do you want?

158
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,681
Okay.

159
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,161
My cousin talked to this guy
two weeks ago

160
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,527
- about this little perfect job.
- No way.

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,001
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

162
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
No!

163
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,441
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

164
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,568
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

165
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,608
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

166
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,762
I don't care. I'm out.

167
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,851
Dr. Pym?

168
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,321
Yes. I'm still alive.

169
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,447
ID?

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,968
Perhaps that will suffice.

171
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,202
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

172
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,488
Is that Hank Pym?

173
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,846
Good morning, Hank.

174
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,121
Hope.

175
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,680
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

176
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,524
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that
you could find the time to join us today.

177
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,008
More like "thrilled."

178
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,600
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

179
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,091
What's the occasion?

180
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,049
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

181
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,244
We're ready for you inside.

182
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,441
Ouch.

183
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,967
I guess some old wounds
never heal, huh?

184
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,724
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

185
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,682
You're in for a treat.

186
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,125
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

187
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,364
How's your face?

188
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,169
After you.

189
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,969
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

190
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,407
This company's founder and my mentor,

191
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,081
Dr. Hank Pym.

192
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,688
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

193
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,001
I immediately started
researching a particle

194
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,845
that could change
the distance between atoms,

195
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,764
while increasing density and strength.

196
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,323
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

197
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,689
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

198
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,683
But just imagine,

199
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,004
a soldier the size of an insect.

200
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,010
The ultimate secret weapon.

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,002
An Ant-Man.

202
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,328
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

203
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,125
Silly, I know.

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,690
Propaganda.

205
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,849
Tales to astonish!

206
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,288
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

207
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,206
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

208
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,807
every single time I asked you,

209
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,880
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

210
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,610
Just a tall tale.

211
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,727
Right.

212
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,883
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

213
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,927
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,844
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

215
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,969
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

216
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,444
Could that be done?

217
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,251
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

218
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,600
Distinguished guests,

219
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,760
I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

220
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,649
The Yellowjacket!

221
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,766
Oh, no.

222
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,162
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose
weapon of war

223
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,251
capable of altering the size of the wearer

224
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,402
for the ultimate combat advantage.

225
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,491
<i>We live in an era</i>

226
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,801
<i>in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves</i>

227
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,963
<i>are undermined
by constant surveillance.</i>

228
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,769
<i>It's time to return to a simpler age.</i>

229
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,688
<i>One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly</i>

230
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,046
<i>to protect their interests.</i>

231
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,962
<i>An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,</i>

232
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,407
<i>The Yellowjacket
can manage any conflict</i>

233
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,845
<i>on the geopolitical landscape</i>

234
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,002
<i>completely unseen.</i>

235
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,005
<i>Efficient in both preventative measures
and tactical assault.</i>

236
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,326
<i>Practical applications
include surveillance,</i>

237
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,084
<i>industrial sabotage,</i>

238
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,283
<i>and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.</i>

239
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,600
<i>A single Yellowjacket</i>

240
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,401
<i>offers the user unlimited influence
to carry out protective actions.</i>

241
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,011
<i>And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets</i>

242
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,291
<i>will create a sustainable environment
of well-being around the world.</i>

243
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,249
<i>The Yellowjacket.</i>

244
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,690
So, it's a suit?

245
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,849
Don't be crude, Frank.

246
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,049
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

247
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,011
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

248
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,970
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

249
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,010
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

250
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,691
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

251
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,524
I really value your opinion.

252
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,044
Thank you for coming. Hope?

253
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,491
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

254
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,686
Thank you.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,525
You seem a bit shocked.

256
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,889
Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

257
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,962
So you finally admit it!

258
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,247
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

259
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,525
That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

260
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,046
Don't do this.

261
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,284
Dr. Cross?

262
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,285
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

263
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,249
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

264
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,526
Deal.

265
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,407
We have to
make our move, Hank.

266
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,527
How close is he?

267
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,285
He still can't shrink a live subject.

268
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,931
Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all.

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,001
No.

270
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,129
I have Cross' complete trust.

271
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,362
- It's too dangerous.
- We don't have a choice.

272
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,002
Well, that's not entirely true.

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,843
I think I found a guy.

274
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,685
Who?

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,490
Daddy!

276
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,050
Peanut! Oh!

277
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,322
Happy birthday!

278
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,401
I'm so sorry I'm late.

279
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,084
I didn't know
what time your party started.

280
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,650
It was on the invitation.

281
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,484
He didn't get an invitation.

282
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,085
But he came anyway!

283
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,130
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,964
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

285
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,041
Oh, you don't...

286
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,121
What are you doing here, Lang?

287
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,725
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

288
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,484
You know, right now, if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

289
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,641
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

290
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,042
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

291
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,291
Hey, look what I have for you.

292
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,771
Can I open it now?

293
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,569
Of course, sweetheart.
It's your birthday.

294
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,530
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

295
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,761
What is that thing?

296
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,569
He's so ugly!

297
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,122
I love him!

298
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,725
Can I go show my friends?

299
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,723
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

300
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,040
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

301
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,208
Look, the child support
is coming, all right?

302
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,320
It's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

303
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But for now, I want you out of my house.

304
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,690
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday.
- It's my house!

305
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,360
- So what? It's my kid!
- Scott!

306
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,727
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

307
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,847
It's a birthday party.

308
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,604
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

309
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,681
She's my daughter.

310
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,171
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

311
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,325
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life.

312
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,363
Your fiancé is an asshat.

313
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,521
He's not an asshat.

314
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,490
- Hey, watch your language. Okay?
- What language? I said "hat."

315
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,925
Stop it.

316
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,248
Really, Maggie? That guy?

317
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,924
Come on!
You could marry anyone you want,

318
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,365
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

319
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,090
At least he's not a crook.

320
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,684
I'm trying, okay? I've changed.
I'm straight.

321
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,127
I had a job and...

322
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,687
I wanna provide.

323
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,326
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

324
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,401
So much.

325
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,802
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

326
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,881
What do I do?

327
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,966
Get an apartment,

328
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,926
get a job, pay child support.

329
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,209
And then we will talk about visitation,
I promise.

330
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,728
You're her hero, Scott.

331
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,890
Just be the person
that she already thinks you are.

332
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,490
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

333
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,088
Yeah. Well, uh...

334
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,643
Unfortunately, we can't just do
whatever we want.

335
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,924
It'd be nice though, right?

336
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,407
But there are laws.

337
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,525
What laws? Of man?

338
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,046
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

339
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,282
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

340
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,643
Darren, I don't think you understand...

341
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,641
Hmm.

342
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,200
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

343
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,771
Goodbye, Frank.

344
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,924
Thank you.

345
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,805
You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

346
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,247
And today,
during my morning meditation,

347
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,244
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

348
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,606
How's that?

349
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,489
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

350
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,487
I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

351
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,166
I devoted my genius to him.

352
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,083
I could have worked anywhere.

353
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,410
I chose my mentor poorly.

354
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,049
You didn't even have a choice.

355
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,047
He never believed in you.

356
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,682
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

357
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,084
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

358
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,730
Because his failures as a mentor,

359
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,928
as a father,

360
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,603
forced us to spread our wings.

361
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,362
You're a success, Darren.

362
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,521
You deserve everything
coming your way.

363
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,721
Ooh.

364
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,490
Stop cheating.

365
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,810
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

366
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,043
Maybe he didn't hear you.

367
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,161
How was the party?

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,480
- Tell me about that tip.
- What?

369
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,528
I wanna know about that tip.

370
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,251
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

371
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,721
Calm down, all right?
I just need to know where it came from.

372
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,086
It's gotta be airtight.

373
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,961
Okay.

374
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,281
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

375
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,681
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

376
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,080
But there was a rosé that saved the day.
It was delightful.

377
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,766
<i>And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.</i>

378
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,047
<i>It was actually the first pair of boobs
I ever touched.</i>

379
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,770
It's the wrong details.

380
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,171
It has nothing to do with the story.

381
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,281
Go.

382
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,761
<i>So, uh, he tells me that she's
working as a housekeeper now, right?</i>

383
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,162
<i>And she's dating this dude, Carlos,
who's a shot caller from across the bay.</i>

384
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,323
<i>And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.</i>

385
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,767
<i>Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO</i>

386
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,922
<i>That is all retired now, but he's loaded.</i>

387
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,721
<i>And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,</i>

388
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,444
<i>and they get to talking, right?</i>

389
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,967
<i>And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.</i>

390
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,125
<i>"This guy's got a big-ass safe just
sitting in the basement, just chilling."</i>

391
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,680
Of course Ernesto comes to me because
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

392
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,761
<i>Of course, I ask him...</i>

393
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,162
<i>"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?"</i>

394
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,480
<i>And he says, "Nah, dawg.</i>

395
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,767
<i>"All she said is that it's super-legit</i>

396
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,002
<i>"and whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."</i>

397
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
What?

398
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,560
Old man have safe.

399
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,762
And he's gone for a week.

400
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,808
All right.
There's an old man, he's got a safe,

401
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,006
and he's gone for a week.

402
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,161
Let's just work with that.

403
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,685
You know what I'm saying?

404
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,690
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

405
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,047
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

406
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,121
Comm check.

407
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,360
- Check.
- Check.

408
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,607
Hey, if the job goes bad,
you know I got your back, right?

409
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,920
Don't worry.

410
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,207
It's not gonna happen.

411
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,444
I love it when he gets cocky.

412
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,561
Damn!

413
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,361
Alarm is dead.

414
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,527
Nice.

415
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,161
<i>All right,
I'm moving through the house.</i>

416
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,249
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

417
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,926
It's got what?
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

418
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,082
<i>Aw, man, are we screwed?</i>

419
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,083
Not necessarily.

420
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,161
I'm in.

421
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,449
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

422
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,044
Oh, man.

423
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,491
<i>What is it?</i>

424
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,851
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

425
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,161
<i>How serious
are we talking, Scotty?</i>

426
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,924
It's a Carbondale.

427
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,411
It's from 1910.

428
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,245
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

429
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,560
Wow.

430
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,051
Can you crack it?

431
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,522
Well, here's the thing.
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

432
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,926
Remember what that iceberg did?

433
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,729
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

434
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,801
Killed everybody.

435
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,405
Did not kill the Old lady.

436
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,682
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

437
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,450
<i>What are you doing?</i>

438
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,160
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

439
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,041
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

440
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,522
<i>- What are you doing now?</i>
- Waiting.

441
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,121
Waiting.

442
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,361
Nice.

443
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,250
<i>What is it? Cash? Jewels?</i>

444
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,363
- There's nothing here.
- What did you say?

445
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,889
- It's a suit.
- What?

446
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,409
It's an old motorcycle suit.

447
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,329
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

448
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,845
No.

449
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
It's a bust.

450
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,286
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

451
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,124
I know you needed to score.

452
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,251
I thought we were using mice.

453
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,241
What's the difference?

454
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,481
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

455
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,369
Darren, maybe we should think...

456
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,920
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

457
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,002
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

458
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,764
Experiment 34-C results,

459
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,887
negative.

460
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,841
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

461
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,650
Why would you lock this up?

462
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,601
This is so weird.

463
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,971
Scotty, what's up, man?

464
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,607
I wonder... What is this?

465
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,521
<i>The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?</i>

466
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,001
What? Who said that?

467
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,329
Luis, down here!

468
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,761
<i>It's a trial by fire, Scott.
Or, in this case,</i>

469
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,887
<i>water.</i>

470
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,647
<i>Guess you're tougher
than you thought.</i>

471
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,805
Oh, I don't want to see this!

472
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,720
Luis!

473
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,687
Son of a...

474
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,211
What the hell?

475
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,760
<i>Not bad for a test drive.</i>

476
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,968
<i>Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.</i>

477
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,088
No! No! No, thank you!

478
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,368
Get down on the ground!

479
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,851
You are under arrest!

480
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,685
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

481
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,801
Oh...

482
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,770
Don't move.

483
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,046
<i>You know,
you almost had us convinced</i>

484
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,248
that you were gonna change your ways.

485
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,962
They were really rooting for you.

486
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,602
It's gonna break their hearts.

487
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,761
- You got a visitor.
- Who?

488
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,201
Your lawyer.

489
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,331
My lawyer?

490
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,886
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

491
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,366
I'm starting to think that
you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

492
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,201
Oh, man.

493
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,886
Sit down.

494
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,564
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

495
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,529
I don't even wanna know
why you have it.

496
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,568
Maggie was right about you.

497
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,161
How do you know about...

498
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,280
No wonder she's trying
to keep you away from Cassie.

499
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,249
The moment things get hard,

500
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,765
you turn right back to crime.

501
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,442
The way I see it,
you have a choice.

502
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,171
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison,

503
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,843
or go back to your cell

504
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,920
and await further instructions.

505
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,411
I don't understand.

506
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,642
No, I don't expect you to.

507
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,769
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly,

508
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,171
neither do I.

509
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,926
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

510
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,161
What?

511
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,643
Second chances don't come around
all that much.

512
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,769
So, next time you think
you might see one,

513
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,323
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

514
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,567
<i>You're my bestest friend!</i>

515
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,680
Are you sure you
don't want a different toy?

516
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,643
No, I love this one.

517
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,971
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

518
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,011
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

519
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,401
Is Daddy a bad man?

520
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,844
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

521
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,926
No.

522
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,849
Daddy just gets confused sometimes,
you know?

523
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,284
<i>Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.</i>

524
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,321
<i>Under the door.</i>

525
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,040
Okay, where to now?

526
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,122
<i>- Hang tight.</i>
- Oh, God.

527
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,961
What, what?

528
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,041
Where the hell did he go?

529
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,406
I have no idea.
He just vanished.

530
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,448
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

531
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,726
Get back! Get back!

532
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,406
<i>Scott, these are my associates.</i>

533
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,330
Is that a camera on an ant?

534
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,289
Yeah, sure. Why not?

535
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,361
Where's the car?

536
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,090
<i>No car. We've got wings.</i>

537
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,446
<i>Incoming!</i>

538
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,409
<i>Put your foot on the central node
and mount the thorax.</i>

539
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
- How safe is...
<i>- Just get on the damn ant, Scott!</i>

540
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,087
Why am I on a police car?
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

541
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,601
<i>So they can give you a lift
past their five-block perimeter.</i>

542
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,330
All right.

543
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,368
- Now, what's the next move?
<i>- Hang on tight.</i>

544
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,204
Oh, this is easy!
I'm getting the hang of this.

545
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,930
Yank up to go up.
It's like a horse.

546
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,048
<i>You're throwing 247 off balance.</i>

547
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,531
Wait, his name is 247?

548
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,364
<i>He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.</i>

549
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,966
<i>Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?</i>

550
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,809
Whoa!

551
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,723
<i>Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.</i>

552
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,285
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

553
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,362
<i>- No, I think it's 247.</i>
- Wait.

554
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,290
<i>Hang on tight!</i>

555
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,328
I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

556
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,284
<i>I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.</i>

557
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
What?

558
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,329
- Can I make one little request?
<i>- No.</i>

559
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,723
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

560
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,681
Time out.

561
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,841
All right, hold on.

562
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,809
Just wait! Whoa!

563
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,050
What happens
if I throw up in this helmet?

564
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,488
<i>It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.</i>

565
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,164
Let's set her down, all right?

566
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,241
I'm getting light-headed.

567
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,401
<i>Hang on, Scott.</i>

568
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,048
I'm getting a little light...

569
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,043
I need a snooze button.

570
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,927
Hit me in 5 minutes.

571
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,760
Hello.

572
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,361
Who are you?

573
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,205
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

574
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,361
Yes.

575
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,601
Why?

576
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,600
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

577
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,603
Oh. Oh.

578
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,441
Hey, look...

579
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,361
Whoa!

580
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,729
<i>Paraponera clavata.</i>

581
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,290
Giant tropical bullet ants,

582
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,960
ranked highest
on the Schmidt pain index.

583
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,880
They're here to keep an eye on you
when I can't.

584
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,765
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

585
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,361
Who?

586
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,721
Hey!

587
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,485
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

588
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,803
How am I supposed to do this?

589
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,123
All right, just one step at a time.

590
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,241
Ugh!

591
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,403
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

592
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,521
I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

593
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,806
We don't need this guy.

594
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,360
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

595
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,011
I did. She's great.

596
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,321
She doesn't think that we need you.

597
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

598
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,083
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

599
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,731
and then Hope has you arrested.

600
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,804
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

601
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,524
She's a little bit anxious.

602
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,525
It has to do with this job,

603
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,126
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

604
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,441
I take it that you're interested in.

605
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,646
What job?

606
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,881
Would you like some tea?

607
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,129
Uh... Sure.

608
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,804
I was very impressed with

609
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,690
how you managed to get
past my security system.

610
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,924
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

611
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,445
Were you watching me?

612
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,729
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.

613
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,201
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

614
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,444
Oh! Excuse me.

615
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,488
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

616
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,091
Vista's security system was one of
the most advanced in the business.

617
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,889
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

618
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,883
But you beat it.

619
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,291
Would you like some sugar?

620
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,930
Yeah, thanks.

621
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,080
You know what?
I'm okay.

622
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,202
How do you make them do that?

623
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,931
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

624
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,641
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

625
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,882
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

626
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,449
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

627
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,529
I speak to them.

628
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,001
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

629
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,491
and see everything.

630
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,449
And still know absolutely nothing.

631
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,087
I'm late to meet Cross.

632
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,684
Uh... Dr. Pym?

633
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,081
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

634
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,291
Sorry, I just have one question.

635
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,488
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

636
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,210
and can I go back to jail now?

637
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,691
Come with me.

638
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,450
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

639
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,726
Huh?

640
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,041
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

641
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,849
That's what powers the suit.

642
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,604
That's why it works.

643
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,801
Wow.

644
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,804
- Whoa!
- But it was dangerous.

645
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,562
It was too dangerous.

646
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,768
So I hid it from the world.

647
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,570
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

648
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,561
Pym Tech.

649
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,806
Yes.

650
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,560
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

651
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,880
Darren Cross.

652
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,007
He's a big deal.

653
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,560
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

654
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,964
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

655
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,361
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

656
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,001
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

657
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,761
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

658
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,049
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

659
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,607
But I wouldn't help him.

660
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,526
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

661
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,125
How could he do that?

662
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,010
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

663
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,411
She was the deciding vote.

664
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,005
But she came back to me

665
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,448
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

666
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,761
The process is highly volatile.

667
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,684
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

668
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,650
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

669
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,681
I don't think Darren realizes this,

670
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,604
and, you know, he's not
the most stable guy to begin with.

671
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,442
So, what do you want from me?

672
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,206
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

673
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,281
Do you?

674
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,805
I do.

675
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,970
If you can help me,

676
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,761
I promise I can help you be
with your daughter again.

677
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,167
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

678
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,841
Absolutely.

679
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,686
My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

680
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,125
What do you want me to do?

681
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,602
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

682
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,080
Are you gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

683
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,321
Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up.
Text me.

684
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,686
Okay. Good news?

685
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,202
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

686
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,806
Are you trying to find my daddy?

687
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,449
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

688
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,165
I just want your daddy to be safe.

689
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,368
Hope you don't catch him.

690
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,170
This isn't the first time these guys

691
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,050
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

692
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,170
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

693
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,607
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

694
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,049
He always wanted my tech.

695
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,442
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

696
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,648
and destroy all the data,

697
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,690
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

698
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,165
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

699
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,244
I spent half my life

700
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,483
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

701
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,326
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

702
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,802
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

703
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,406
This could change the texture of reality.

704
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,410
Besides, they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

705
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,963
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

706
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,768
Scott, they are ants.

707
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,765
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

708
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,687
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

709
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,367
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean,
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

710
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,522
He's right, Hank.
And you know it.

711
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,206
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

712
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,330
I was against using him
when we had months,

713
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,368
and now we have days.

714
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,441
I'm wearing the suit.

715
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,931
Absolutely not!

716
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,924
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

717
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,570
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

718
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,325
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

719
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,846
- We don't have time to screw around!
- Hope, please listen to me...

720
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,490
He is a criminal!
I'm your daughter.

721
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,891
No!

722
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,044
She's right, Hank.

723
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,804
I'm not your guy.

724
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,721
Why don't you wear the suit?

725
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,007
You think I don't want to?

726
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,320
I can't.

727
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,803
I spent years wearing it,

728
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,647
and it took a toll on me.

729
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,371
You're our only option.

730
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,684
Before Hope lost her mother,

731
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,685
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

732
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,848
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

733
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,162
It's too late for me,

734
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,129
but not for you.

735
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,163
This is your chance.

736
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,847
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

737
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,811
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

738
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,046
It's not about saving our world.

739
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,730
It's about saving theirs.

740
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,523
Damn. That was a good speech.

741
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,201
Scott,

742
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,040
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

743
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,486
In the right hands,

744
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,848
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

745
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,686
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

746
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,604
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

747
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,886
you need to be fast.

748
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,883
You should be able to shrink and grow

749
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,166
on a dime.

750
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,082
So your size always suits your needs.

751
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,009
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

752
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,051
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

753
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,445
Ow!

754
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,761
Ahhh!

755
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,770
Ow!

756
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,086
Useless.

757
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,845
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

758
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,843
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

759
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,208
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

760
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,648
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

761
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,165
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

762
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,044
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

763
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,849
Show me.

764
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,680
- Terrible.
- You wanna show me how to punch?

765
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,281
Show me...

766
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,484
That's how you punch.

767
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,325
- She's been looking forward to this.
- No kidding.

768
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,051
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

769
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,240
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

770
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,328
We lost her in a plane crash.

771
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,129
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

772
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,770
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

773
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,604
We're working, here.

774
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,520
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

775
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,521
Were you going for the hand?

776
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,968
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

777
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,725
Do not screw with the regulator.

778
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,564
If that regulator is compromised,

779
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,210
you would go subatomic.

780
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,645
What does that mean?

781
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,882
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

782
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,411
What does that mean?

783
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,008
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

784
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,127
become irrelevant

785
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,044
as you shrink for all eternity.

786
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,371
Everything that you know

787
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,771
and love,

788
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,250
gone forever.

789
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,482
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

790
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,891
You've learned about the suit,

791
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,691
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

792
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,047
the ants.

793
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,926
Loyal, brave,

794
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,809
<i>and your partners on this job.</i>

795
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,764
Paratrechina longicornis.
<i>Commonly known as crazy ants.</i>

796
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,047
<i>They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,</i>

797
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,566
<i>which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.</i>

798
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,324
You're not so crazy.

799
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,722
Hey!

800
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,126
You're cute.

801
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,728
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

802
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,766
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

803
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,763
<i>There's a security guard posted
around the clock.</i>

804
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,446
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

805
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,091
Okay, who's next?

806
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,451
Paraponera clavata.

807
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,170
<i>I know. Bullet ants, right?</i>

808
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,810
Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?

809
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,729
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

810
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,480
<i>The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,</i>

811
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,851
And the only access point is a tube

812
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,685
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

813
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,603
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

814
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,887
<i>The tube is protected
by a laser grid,</i>

815
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,724
and we can only power that down
for 15 seconds.

816
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,406
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

817
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,565
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

818
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,802
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

819
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,080
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

820
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,930
Ideal for ground and air transport.

821
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,684
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

822
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,281
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony."

823
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,600
That's good. That's very good.

824
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,322
Because this time, you're really gonna
have to learn how to control him.

825
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,131
<i>Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.</i>

826
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,366
Aw! You okay?
Did I hurt...

827
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,248
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

828
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,600
<i>The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.</i>

829
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,040
<i>Red shrinks.</i>

830
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,650
<i>Blue enlarges.</i>

831
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,166
Solenopsis mandibularis.

832
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,571
<i>Known for their bite,</i>

833
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,371
<i>the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.</i>

834
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,523
<i>They are handy to get you in and out
of difficult places.</i>

835
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,844
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

836
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,562
They're not listening to me.

837
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,291
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

838
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,328
No shortcuts, no lies.

839
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,088
Throwing insults into the mix
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

840
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,685
We don't have time for coddling.

841
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,922
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

842
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,411
Really?

843
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,164
Is that where our focus should be?

844
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,646
Hope!

845
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,171
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

846
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,287
We can't do this without her.

847
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,521
Oh, God.

848
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,568
You gotta lock your doors.

849
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,530
I mean, really, there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

850
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,284
Do you think this is a joke?

851
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,846
Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

852
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,160
You have a daughter.

853
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,571
I'm doing this for her.

854
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,610
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

855
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,360
He was in grief.

856
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,805
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

857
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,486
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

858
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,283
He just sent me off to boarding school.

859
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,601
You know, I thought,

860
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,805
with all that's at stake,

861
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,043
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

862
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,043
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

863
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,010
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

864
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,445
Then why are you here?

865
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,522
It proves that he loves you.

866
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,207
Hope. Look at me.

867
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,130
I'm expendable.

868
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,205
That's why I'm here.

869
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,203
You must have realized that by now.

870
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,287
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

871
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,527
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

872
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,487
Anyway...

873
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,963
You know,
I didn't know you had a daughter

874
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,281
when I called the cops on you.

875
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,481
What's her name?

876
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,810
Cassie.

877
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,324
It's a pretty name.

878
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,564
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

879
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,608
That's how it works.

880
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,171
Think about Cassie.

881
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,165
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

882
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,689
Open your eyes

883
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,127
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

884
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,200
That's good!

885
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,970
Your mother convinced me

886
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,123
to let her join me on my missions.

887
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,802
They called her the Wasp.

888
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,121
She was born to it.

889
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,728
And there's not a day that goes by

890
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,604
that I don't regret having said yes.

891
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,764
It was 1987.

892
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,043
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

893
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,570
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

894
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,169
<i>The only way to the internal mechanics</i>

895
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,163
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

896
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,162
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

897
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,483
<i>But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.</i>

898
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,645
<i>Your mother,</i>

899
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,085
<i>she didn't hesitate.</i>

900
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,844
Janet! No!

901
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,080
She turned off her regulator

902
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,569
and went subatomic

903
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,168
to deactivate the bomb.

904
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,769
And she was gone.

905
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,328
Your mom died a hero.

906
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,321
And I spent the next 10 years

907
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,764
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

908
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,448
You were trying to bring her back.

909
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,687
But all I learned was we know nothing.

910
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,523
It's not your fault.

911
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,364
She made her choice.

912
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,526
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

913
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,570
I was trying to protect you.

914
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,050
I lost your mother.

915
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,925
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

916
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,125
I'm sorry.

917
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,766
This is awesome.

918
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,524
It's awesome, you know?

919
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,682
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

920
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,205
It's important.

921
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,610
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

922
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,409
Yes, you did. Yes.

923
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,483
I'm going to make some tea.

924
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,201
Nailed it!

925
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,488
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

926
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,243
<i>The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.</i>

927
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,481
It's freezing!

928
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,927
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

929
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,491
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

930
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,291
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

931
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,044
We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

932
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,009
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

933
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,010
It's currently collecting dust

934
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,209
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

935
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,248
<i>Should be a piece of cake.</i>

936
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,203
You're over the target area.

937
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,607
Disengage now, Scott!

938
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,841
Squadron A, go!

939
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,251
B, go!

940
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,761
C, go!

941
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,251
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

942
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,402
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

943
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,527
Stay calm.

944
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,249
Guys?
We might have a problem.

945
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,767
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

946
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,887
It's not!

947
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,163
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

948
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,369
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

949
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,521
<i>Abort now!</i>

950
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,331
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

951
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,488
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

952
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,441
He's gonna lose the suit.

953
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,010
He's gonna lose his life.

954
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,968
<i>All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.</i>

955
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,690
Somebody's home, Scott.

956
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,171
<i>What's going on down there, Sam?</i>

957
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,366
It's the Falcon!

958
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,168
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

959
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,721
Wait a second.

960
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,808
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

961
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,405
It's okay. He can't see me.

962
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,527
I can see you.

963
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,761
He can see me.

964
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,043
Hi. I'm Scott.

965
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,770
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

966
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,128
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I'm a big fan.

967
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,850
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

968
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,841
I'm Ant-Man.

969
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,160
"Ant-Man"?

970
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,362
What? You haven't heard of me?

971
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,204
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

972
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,045
You wanna tell me what you want?

973
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,561
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

974
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,369
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

975
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,091
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

976
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,571
I know exactly how that is.

977
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,527
Located the breach.

978
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,080
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

979
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,085
What the hell are you doing?

980
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,760
Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

981
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,126
Sorry!

982
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,730
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

983
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,481
That's enough!

984
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,204
Ant-thony! A little help!

985
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,966
I've lost visual.

986
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,480
He's inside my pack!

987
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,607
Sorry!

988
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,520
You seem like a really great guy.

989
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,360
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

990
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,167
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

991
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,081
You jeopardized everything!

992
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,644
You got it.

993
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,641
Well done.

994
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,720
Wait a minute.

995
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,171
Did you just compliment me?

996
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,720
- He did, didn't he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

997
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,046
I was good, wasn't I?

998
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:19,241
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

999
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,800
Let us not dwell on the past.

1000
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,008
We gotta finish our planning.

1001
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,044
Don't mind him.

1002
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,561
You did good.

1003
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,726
Darren.

1004
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,370
How the hell did you get in here?

1005
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,841
You left the front door open, Hank.

1006
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,240
It's official.

1007
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,441
You're old.

1008
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,161
The plans.

1009
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,164
He will kill him.

1010
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,085
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1011
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,610
I have good news.

1012
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,920
Really?

1013
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,761
What's that?

1014
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:10,002
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1015
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,880
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

1016
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,726
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

1017
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,446
You're welcome.

1018
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,280
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

1019
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,962
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

1020
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,770
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1021
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,126
I'll be there.

1022
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,645
What did you see in me?

1023
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,251
I don't know what you mean.

1024
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,766
All those years ago, you picked me.

1025
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,330
What did you see?

1026
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,284
I saw myself.

1027
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,281
Then why did you push me away?

1028
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,162
Because I saw too much of myself.

1029
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,451
<i>He knows. He's baiting you.</i>

1030
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,249
We have to call it off.

1031
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,481
We're all taking risks.

1032
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,891
What if he saw me here?

1033
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,291
He didn't. There's no way.

1034
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,727
How do you know that?

1035
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,486
Darren, hi.

1036
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,410
Hope, where are you right now?

1037
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,246
I'm at home. Why?

1038
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,084
<i>I just saw Hank.</i>

1039
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,969
<i>I still get nothing but contempt from him.</i>

1040
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,601
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

1041
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,126
<i>We need to start everyone working
around the clock.</i>

1042
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,049
<i>Get the assembly line up and running.</i>

1043
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,406
<i>And I'm tripling security.</i>

1044
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,482
Full sensors at all entrances

1045
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,962
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1046
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,684
Great. Good idea.

1047
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:16,084
<i>Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.</i>

1048
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:23,003
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1049
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,048
But he is not onto you.

1050
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,487
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

1051
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,329
and closing exterior vents.

1052
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,323
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1053
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,365
The water main.

1054
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,403
You can't add security to a water main.

1055
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,801
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1056
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,086
that's how I get in.

1057
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,367
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

1058
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,805
to change the water pressure.

1059
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,611
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

1060
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,205
So we expand our team.

1061
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,801
What do we need?

1062
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,282
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

1063
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,203
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1064
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,691
and kill the laser grid,

1065
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,081
and a getaway guy.

1066
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,131
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three Wombats. No way.

1067
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,205
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1068
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,887
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

1069
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,849
Because we just robbed you.

1070
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,961
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1071
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,326
Two smoothie machines.

1072
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,010
Are you sure they can handle this?

1073
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,491
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

1074
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,167
You'll forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

1075
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,931
Well, hey, everybody just kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

1076
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,331
We know our business.

1077
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,767
We broke into this spooky-ass house,
didn't we?

1078
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,285
I let you.

1079
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,648
Well, one could say that
I let you let me.

1080
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,042
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this.
- Yeah, we can handle it.

1081
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,884
- You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

1082
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,440
- I'm in the system?
- You're in the system.

1083
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,726
The system?

1084
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,087
Yeah, we're doomed.

1085
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,207
All right.

1086
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,964
There's something
you guys need to see.

1087
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,883
When you get to this corner,

1088
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,725
there's gonna be three offices
on your left side.

1089
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,131
Damn!

1090
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,531
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1091
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,285
Now, look,
this is gonna get weird, all right?

1092
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,603
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.
There's no reason to be scared.

1093
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,011
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1094
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,923
- Really?
- Yeah.

1095
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,161
Good.

1096
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,243
This is the work of gypsies.

1097
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,446
That's witchcraft.

1098
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,681
Wow, that's amazing.

1099
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,810
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1100
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,961
That's some kind of wizardry.

1101
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,121
This is sorcery!

1102
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,326
How'd you do that, bro?

1103
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,368
Don't freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

1104
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,166
Ahhh!

1105
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,685
Get off! Get off!

1106
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,286
Wait, I thought
Daddy didn't get scared!

1107
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,971
I gave them each half a Xanax

1108
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,646
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

1109
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,882
They fell right asleep.

1110
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,131
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

1111
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,163
No, please don't.

1112
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,686
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

1113
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,606
I'm just glad that you might have
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1114
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,763
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

1115
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,525
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

1116
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,204
to almost liking you.

1117
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,009
You really should write poetry.

1118
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,089
Get some sleep, Scott.

1119
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,410
All right, just so we're clear,
everyone here knows their role, right?

1120
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,084
- Dave?
- Wheels on the ground.

1121
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,491
- Kurt?
- Eyes in the sky.

1122
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,005
- Luis?
- Oh, man, you know it.

1123
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,600
You know what?
I get to wear a uniform.

1124
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,244
- That's what's up.
- Luis.

1125
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,527
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good.
I'm just excited.

1126
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,931
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

1127
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,331
So, you know,
that makes me nervous, too.

1128
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,401
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1129
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,369
- Oh, my Lord.
- She's not my...

1130
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,727
You know what? I was thinking of
a tactic, like when I go undercover.

1131
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,723
Like a whistling. You know
what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

1132
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,883
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

1133
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,008
It's not <i>The Andy Griffith</i> Show.
No whistling.

1134
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,046
All clear in Sector One.

1135
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,361
Step out.

1136
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,166
All clear.

1137
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,966
We're set.

1138
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,885
Wish me luck.

1139
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,004
Utilities online.

1140
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,249
Hey! What are you doing?

1141
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,408
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I'm securing it.

1142
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,131
I'm the boss.

1143
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,890
- Oh.
- Utilities 1.3...

1144
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,122
<i>Water level is dropping!</i>

1145
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,483
<i>Coming up on extraction pipe.</i>

1146
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,971
All right, I see it.

1147
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,442
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

1148
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,689
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1149
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,481
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

1150
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,962
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1151
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,964
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1152
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,048
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1153
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,326
This is problem?

1154
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,448
Considering the Crown Vic's
the most commonly used car

1155
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,681
for undercover cops, man,

1156
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,851
yes, this is problem.

1157
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,841
That's Pym.

1158
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,925
Oh, no.

1159
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,240
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

1160
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,885
<i>Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...</i>

1161
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,884
<i>I don't remember what it's called,
but I feel bad for this guy.</i>

1162
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,326
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

1163
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,605
Ow! Ow!

1164
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,486
See? That's what I'm talking about.

1165
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,961
That's what I call
an unfortunate casualty

1166
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,042
in a very serious operation.

1167
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,408
Signal decoy in place.

1168
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,883
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1169
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,407
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1170
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,164
Scott, we have problem.

1171
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,163
<i>Problem? What's the problem?</i>

1172
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,480
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1173
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,210
Listen to me.

1174
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:28,080
If I don't get into this building,
people will die.

1175
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,449
That's awfully dramatic.

1176
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,606
Are you kidding me?

1177
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,844
Problem solved.

1178
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,966
Well...

1179
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,603
How do I look?

1180
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,881
There he is.

1181
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,683
Just in time. Come on.

1182
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,889
<i>12-point verification.</i>

1183
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,769
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

1184
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,365
<i>Confirming authorization level.</i>

1185
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,044
Well, you can never be too safe.

1186
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,640
<i>Access granted.</i>

1187
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,330
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

1188
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,968
You really did it.

1189
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,883
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1190
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,730
Arriving in second position.

1191
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,688
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!

1192
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,966
Proceeding to command position.

1193
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,364
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

1194
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,362
All right, guys. I'm in position.

1195
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,124
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1196
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,487
No, no, no, no, no!

1197
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,926
Did you see that?

1198
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,970
Assume formation.

1199
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,963
All right, you cute little crazies,

1200
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,769
let's fry these servers!

1201
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,082
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1202
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,601
<i>Servers are fried.</i>

1203
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,887
Data backup completely erased.

1204
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,564
Heading to the particle chamber.

1205
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,923
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1206
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,281
My associates have agreed
to your terms.

1207
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,521
Wonderful.

1208
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,444
Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

1209
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,124
They're representatives of Hydra.

1210
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,531
They're not what they were.

1211
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,887
They're doing some interesting work.

1212
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,406
And I'm enjoying myself.

1213
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,322
You tried to hide
your technology from me.

1214
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,368
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

1215
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,327
Wow.

1216
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,721
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming
a mile away,

1217
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,882
but I just figured it'd
be all pathetic and weak.

1218
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,485
Well, you figured wrong.

1219
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,011
I know this van.

1220
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,601
Anybody home?

1221
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,441
All right, guys. I'm here.

1222
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,849
I'm setting the charges.

1223
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,729
Great job, guys.
I'll take it from here.

1224
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,446
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1225
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,401
Final position.

1226
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,327
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

1227
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,970
- Almost.
- No, you're not.

1228
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,520
- I'm getting close!
- No, you're not.

1229
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,804
San Francisco P.D.!

1230
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,881
Out of the van!

1231
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,520
I know you're in there!

1232
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,722
- Make it go faster.
- Dude, seriously.

1233
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,522
Ready to jump.
Do you read, Kurt?

1234
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,601
So close.

1235
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,811
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!
- Freeze!

1236
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,530
There was a black guy
that looked exactly like me

1237
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,523
who attacked us and put us
in the back of this disgusting van.

1238
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,090
- Get out of the van!
- Okay, I'm coming.

1239
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,969
Take it easy!

1240
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,008
No, I will not move! Go now!

1241
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,208
- Wait!
- What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1242
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,121
Phew!

1243
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,761
What? What?

1244
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,686
Hey, little guy.

1245
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,529
I always suspected you had
a suit stored away somewhere.

1246
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Which begs the question,

1247
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,802
who is the new Ant-Man?

1248
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,326
Who is the man that my beloved mentor

1249
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,289
trusted even more than me?

1250
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,807
Scott Lang.

1251
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,610
A martyr

1252
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,166
who took on the system
and paid the price,

1253
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,847
losing his family and his only daughter
in the process.

1254
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,163
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1255
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:13,961
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

1256
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,127
And then he disappears magically,

1257
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,448
despite having no money to his name.

1258
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,205
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1259
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,326
The only thing that can rival my creation.

1260
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,802
Darren, don't do this.

1261
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,968
If you sell to these men,

1262
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,485
it's gonna be chaos.

1263
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,971
I already have.

1264
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,485
And for twice the price,

1265
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,562
thanks to you.

1266
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:46,048
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate
an Avengers facility.

1267
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,088
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1268
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:52,006
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1269
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,451
They don't run on diesel.

1270
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,410
If you want the fuel,
you'll have to come to me.

1271
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,369
What do you call the only man

1272
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,410
who can arm the most
powerful weapon in the world?

1273
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,691
The most powerful man in the world.

1274
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:08,285
You proud of me yet?

1275
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,409
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

1276
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:15,201
It's been too late for a long time now.

1277
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,208
Darren!

1278
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,441
What are you doing?

1279
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,729
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

1280
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,529
This is not who you are.

1281
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,450
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

1282
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,848
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1283
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,245
You're right.
I have to be the one to do it.

1284
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,126
Here we go.

1285
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,729
Drop your gun.

1286
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,290
You know, I came to the house
the other night to kill him,

1287
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,441
but you were there.

1288
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,047
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

1289
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,400
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

1290
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,366
but I think I am now!

1291
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,522
Drop your gun now!

1292
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,008
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

1293
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,242
Dad!

1294
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,200
Hank, no.

1295
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,930
No, Hank.

1296
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,488
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1297
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,640
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1298
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,524
Take the suit off,
or I'll blow your brains out and peel it off.

1299
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,249
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.

1300
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,810
Request immediate backup!

1301
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,166
Go, go, go!

1302
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,969
Get me to the roof.

1303
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,280
And radio ahead.

1304
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,204
I want to make sure the helicopter
is ready to take off.

1305
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,327
You two,

1306
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,085
kill anything that comes out of that vault!

1307
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,369
Dad, can you move?

1308
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,131
We need to get him out of here.

1309
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:51,046
Go get that suit.

1310
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,441
Hey, Scotty.

1311
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,249
Hey, did I save your life?

1312
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,006
Scotty?

1313
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,004
Thank you, Luis.

1314
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,650
- Are we the good guys?
- Yeah.

1315
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,001
- We're the good guys, right?
- Yeah, we're the good guys.

1316
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,284
Feels kinda weird, you know.

1317
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,442
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

1318
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,602
Get out of here before this place blows!

1319
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,568
Damn it! That guy.

1320
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,848
Hey! We're getting out of here!

1321
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,407
The charges are set.

1322
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,482
We've gotta find a way out of here.
And fast.

1323
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,483
Don't worry.

1324
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,131
I'm not gonna die.

1325
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,645
And neither are you.

1326
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,246
It's not a keychain.

1327
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,290
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

1328
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,844
And there's a tank.

1329
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,970
A little help!

1330
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:58,606
I got it.

1331
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,845
We need a doctor!

1332
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,400
We've got him.

1333
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,170
Thank you.

1334
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,084
Let's go!

1335
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,525
Ant-thony!

1336
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,126
Go!

1337
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,680
You're gonna regret that.

1338
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,570
Wait a minute! Get out of that van!

1339
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,250
- What?
- Get out of that van!

1340
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,200
It's too loud, there's a tank.
I can't hear you!

1341
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,760
Hey! Hey!

1342
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,847
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

1343
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,445
The windows!

1344
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,764
Did you think you could
stop the future with a heist?

1345
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,410
It was never just a heist!

1346
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,090
Put the gun down!

1347
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,808
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

1348
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,128
We gotta set her down somewhere.

1349
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,487
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

1350
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,160
<i>Playing Disintegration
by the Cure.</i>

1351
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:27,841
Call 911!

1352
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,924
It's okay.

1353
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,328
Freeze! Put your hands up!
Get them up!

1354
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,881
Scott?

1355
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,280
Paxton, you have to listen to me!

1356
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,847
Paxton, turn around! Take me back!

1357
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,922
I am taking you back. To prison.

1358
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,480
There's something in that backyard
that needs to be destroyed.

1359
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,641
In the bug zapper. There...

1360
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,808
You need to desist right now!
Your delusions are out of hand.

1361
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:45,204
<i>All units, we have a 2-36
in progress at 840 Winter Street.</i>

1362
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,611
- Cassie!
- That's my house.

1363
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,486
Don't be scared.

1364
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,766
Paxton, let me help!

1365
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,842
- Don't move.
- Let me help!

1366
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,002
- Maggie! What's going on?
- He's got Cassie!

1367
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,650
- Who's got Cassie, honey?
- That thing.

1368
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,840
- Thing?
- I don't know! I don't know!

1369
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,644
Are you a monster?

1370
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,202
Do I look like a monster?

1371
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,685
I want my daddy!

1372
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,771
I want your daddy, too.

1373
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:39,567
There you are.

1374
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,005
Daddy, is that you?

1375
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:43,641
Hi, peanut.

1376
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,801
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1377
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,845
Now, where did you go, little guy?

1378
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,006
There you are.

1379
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,291
Not just me!

1380
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,280
Damn it!

1381
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,570
Go! Go!

1382
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:23,964
Scotty needs us,
you know what I'm saying?

1383
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,883
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

1384
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,726
Back it up.

1385
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,802
- Back it up, slow.
- Yeah.

1386
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,325
- Back it up.
- Yeah.

1387
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,845
- Back it up.
- Okay.

1388
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,684
- We just back it up, okay?
- That's it.

1389
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,125
- Back it up.
- That's right.

1390
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:42,010
- Backin' up?
- Yep, just backin' up.

1391
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,286
No, no. Just back it up.

1392
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,048
You insult me, Scott.

1393
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,120
Your very existence is insulting to me.

1394
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,321
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you
if you were bigger.

1395
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,846
Yeah, I agree.

1396
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,481
Cassie!

1397
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:42,247
I'm gonna show you
just how insignificant you are.

1398
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,846
Cassie! I'm coming!

1399
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,290
That's a messed-up looking dog.

1400
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,486
I'm gonna destroy

1401
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,130
everything you love.

1402
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,290
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

1403
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:15,451
I can't break through.

1404
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,448
It's titanium, you idiot!

1405
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,568
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1406
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,085
Sorry, sweetheart.

1407
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,606
You have to help Daddy
pay for his mistakes.

1408
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,040
- You stay behind me, okay?
- Okay.

1409
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:34,081
Stay behind me.

1410
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:38,484
I'm gonna have to shrink
between the molecules to get in there.

1411
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,608
Get away from us!

1412
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,481
Daddy, help!

1413
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,164
I love you, Cassie.

1414
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,365

01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,400
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

1438
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,761
Sorry.

1439
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,528
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1440
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,601
Mommy!

1441
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,084
She's fine, she's fine.

1442
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,010
<i>Scott, please.</i>

1443
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:18,569
You don't remember anything?

1444
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,801
Hank. I don't.

1445
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,287
There must be something else.

1446
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,129
Well, I suppose the human mind

1447
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,885
just can't comprehend the experience,

1448
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,291
but you made it.

1449
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,610
You went in,

1450
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,689
and you got out.

1451
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,484
It's amazing.

1452
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,924
Scott,

1453
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,923
I'll walk you out.

1454
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,405
Get some rest.

1455
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,041
Is it possible?

1456
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:21,967
When did this happen?

1457
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,166
Nothing's happening.

1458
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,481
Whoa. Hold on.
Something's kind of happening.

1459
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:27,608
Well, if that's the case,

1460
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,205
shoot me again.

1461
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:32,166
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1462
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,163
I'm a little surprised myself.

1463
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,607
I have to get somewhere.
I'll see you later, Hank.

1464
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,170
Really, Hope.

1465
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,365
- Scott.
- Yeah?

1466
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,689
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, yeah.

1467
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,043
Scott,
I met with my captain today.

1468
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,805
He wanted a report on the night
that you got out of jail.

1469
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:50,880
Something happened with the cameras.

1470
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,807
Some circuits got fried.

1471
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,161
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

1472
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,366
Really?

1473
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:59,885
Well, yeah.

1474
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:04,604
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1475
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,648
Thank you, Paxton.

1476
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,165
I'm blown away.

1477
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,769
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

1478
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,888
Well, that's my pleasure.

1479
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:17,249
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1480
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,691
- This is awkward.
- Yeah.

1481
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,569
Yeah.

1482
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,130
I mean, what do we even talk about
after all of that?

1483
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,565
- Oh, I know.
- What?

1484
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:28,211
- I did my first cartwheel today.
- What?

1485
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,886
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

1486
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,371
But today was the magic day.

1487
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,720
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1488
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,481
No, that can't be Cassie.
That's not you.

1489
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,200
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, it is.

1490
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,368
This is a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

1491
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,606
Yeah, that's her.

1492
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,130
Good boy.

1493
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,771
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1494
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:53,721
Sorry.

1495
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:57,129
It's work.

1496
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,046
Yeah.

1497
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:01,760
All right.

1498
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,564
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1499
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:04,971
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1500
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:08,931
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1501
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,650
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1502
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:13,127
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1503
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,440
<i>And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.</i>

1504
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,721
<i>But you know me, I'm more
like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?</i>

1505
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:20,485
<i>But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!</i>

1506
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,728
- Luis.
- Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1507
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,802
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1508
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,848
<i>But anyway, Ignacio tells me,</i>

1509
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,561
<i>"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.</i>

1510
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,007
<i>"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he
goes up to the bartender and goes,</i>

1511
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,764
<i>"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

1512
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,160
<i>"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"</i>

1513
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,851
<i>The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."</i>

1514
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:40,843
<i>So this writer chick tells Ignacio,</i>

1515
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,730
<i>"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,</i>

1516
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:45,529
<i>"and I got mad connects
with the peeps behind the curtains,</i>

1517
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:46,567
<i>"you know what I'm saying?"</i>

1518
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,165
<i>Ignacio's like, "For real?"</i>

1519
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:51,210
<i>And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,
I can't tell you who my contact is,</i>

1520
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,645
<i>"because he works with the Avengers."</i>

1521
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,046
Oh, no.

1522
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,521
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

1523
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,761
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1524
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,888
<i>"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,</i>

1525
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:01,086
<i>"who's flashing his fresh tack,</i>

1526
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:03,731
<i>"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"</i>

1527
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:06,929
<i>And she's like, "Well, we got everything
nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.</i>

1528
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,082
<i>"We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who crawls up the walls.</i>

1529
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,889
<i>"You gotta be more specific."</i>

1530
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,803
<i>And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."</i>

1531
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:16,327
And I'm, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1532
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,447
So I asked Ignacio,

1533
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,568
<i>"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick</i>

1534
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:21,881
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1535
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,200
"that he's looking for him?"

1536
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,411
And? What'd he say?

1537
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:31,125
He said, "Yes."

1538
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,487
There's something I want to show you.

1539
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:33,968
I realized you can't destroy power.

1540
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:39,565
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1541
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:48,408
This is an advanced prototype

1542
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:51,370
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1543
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,491
She never got to use it.

1544
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:00,523
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1545
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,686
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1546
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,721
It's about damn time.

1547
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,451
<i>Hey, Cap!</i>

1548
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:37,167
This would have been a lot easier
a week ago.

1549
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,163
- If we call Tony...
- He won't believe us.

1550
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,241
Even if he did...

1551
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,049
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

1552
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,125
We're on our own.

1553
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:47,851
Maybe not.

1554
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:51,565
I know a guy.

1554
01:56:52,305 --> 01:57:52,492
