1
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,939

2
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,150

3
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,524
You've reached Dr Stuart Price.

4
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:09,992
The office will be closed until the 24th.
If this is an emergency, please try...

5
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,992

6
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,828

7
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,167
Hi. This is Dr. Stu Price.

8
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,580
I'm getting married, so I'll be out
of the country for two weeks.

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:24,343
I'm not sure if I'll have cell service.
If this is a dental emergency, plea...

10
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,794
Nothing.

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,390

12
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,015
Daddy, please. You're not helping.

13
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,524
Not the eyes of a man.

14
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,026
The eyes of a coward.

15
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,731

16
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,441

17
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,781
Excuse me.

18
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,787
--Phil.

19
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,702
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,833
Where the hell are you?

21
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,708
It happened again.

22
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,044
Don't say that.

23
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,207
Please.

24
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,468
No, this time we really fucked up.

25
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,176
Seriously, what is wrong with you three?

26
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,595
So much, Trace,
I don't even know where to begin.

27
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,726
TRACY:
Oh, God. How bad?

28
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,392
Like no wedding bad?

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,897
Yeah.

30
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,852
Little worse than that.

31
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,128
Mm-hm.

32
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,586
You really need to floss more.

33
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,881
Fuck that. That's why I come here.

34
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,469
Then you should come more than
once every two years.

35
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,978
- So you could bleed me of all my money?
- I never charge you a dime, Phil.

36
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,186
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous?
- Uh, you don't, actually.

37
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,350
Come on. Just one hit.

38
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,317
Fillings look pretty good.
Any other problems?

39
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,534
Yeah, actually.
You're getting married in Thailand.

40
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,663
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph.
That's two grand right there.

41
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,289
My mother-in-law's watching the kids.

42
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,701
Now she's got this whole new thing
to hold over my head.

43
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,869
Plus it takes five days to get there.

44
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,540
It's a 16-hour flight.
And it's beautiful when you get there.

45
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,834
- Whatever. it's a hassle.
- It is kind of far.

46
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,712
Lauren's been there a week
and she's still jet-lagged.

47
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,051
It's where her parents are from.
It means a lot.

48
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,309
Who gives a shit about her parents?
Her dad hates you.

49
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,890
He doesn't hate me.

50
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,727
He's just never spoken to me.
I think it's a cultural thing.

51
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,938
Why can't you get married in Vegas
like last time? So much easier.

52
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,229
Why can't you just be excited for me?

53
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,568
This is my wedding.

54
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,574
You're really happy, huh?

55
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,081
I really am.

56
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,253
All right. I'm happy too.

57
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,540
Thank you.

58
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,924
It's gonna be fun.

59
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,757

60
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,927
Phil? Put the prescription pad back.

61
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,573
Thank you.
You know that's a felony, right?

62
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,278
Fuck you, man.

63
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,620
- Was this right up against your scrotum?
- Yep.

64
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,951
TRACY: Oh, my God. I just realized.
DOUG: What?

65
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,869
TRACY:
I forgot to renew my passport.

66
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,287
Oh, no.

67
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,707
Good thing I did it last week.
It's in the kitchen drawer.

68
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,591
You're the best.

69
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,468
Hey, we're a team.

70
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:22,474
No, I mean, you are a good guy.
Like, a really good guy.

71
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,725
Thank you.

72
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,728
So I know you're not gonna get mad.

73
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,264
Mad? What...? Mad at what?

74
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,727
Alan found out that we're going to Thailand
for Stu's wedding.

75
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,940
So?

76
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,981
So he's heartbroken, Doug.
You guys are like his family.

77
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,149
No, your family is like his family.

78
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:44,079
All Alan talks about is the three of you.
And that weekend.

79
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,831
Wait. Is he the one that keeps calling
and hanging up?

80
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:51,670
He does that when he's upset. He doesn't
understand why he's not invited.

81
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,834
Could you just run it by Stu?

82
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,466
Just run it by him.

83
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,210
For me?

84
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,009
STU:
No fucking way.

85
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,515
Absolutely not.

86
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,142
Come on, Stu. it's killing him.

87
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,678
I don't care.

88
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,938
Honestly, the two of you
were barely invited.

89
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,848
PHIL: Oh.
- All right. I get it. I really do.

90
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,360
Just, you know what? Alan considers you
to be one of his best friends.

91
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,065
I consider Alan to be insane.

92
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,354
PHIL:
Stu, throw him a bone.

93
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,819
His dad pays
for everything he eats and breaks.

94
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,701
We should squeeze the old man
to cover the bachelor party.

95
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,907
That's good.

96
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:30,122
I'm glad you brought that up,
because this is the bachelor party.

97
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,956
- What?
- What are you talking about?

98
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,041
Yeah. it's my bachelor brunch.

99
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:39,506
Go crazy. Get some chocolate-chip
pancakes, a lap dance from the waitress.

100
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:44,176
That's bullshit. Ha, ha. You can't just
skip out of a bachelor party, Stu.

101
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,934
You see that?
That's orange juice with a napkin on top.

102
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,812
Do you know why?
So nobody roofies me.

103
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,770
Well, I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe
at a bachelor party.

104
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,026
Come on.
Don't you think you're overreacting?

105
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,278
No, I don't.

106
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm still putting the broken pieces
of my psyche back together.

107
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,862

108
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,027
And you know what the glue is?

109
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,494
Lauren. And I'm not doing anything
to screw that up.

110
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,785
- You wouldn't be with her if it wasn't for us.
- Oh, this'll be good.

111
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,420
Stu, think about it.
You ended up ditching Melissa.

112
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,672
Two years later,
you met your true soul mate.

113
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,586
You take Vegas out of that equation,
you would have married a cunt.

114
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,092
It's okay. I'm allowed to say it.
It's a bachelor party.

115
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,723
Drink up, everybody.

116
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,680
Wait, there's no alcohol.
I forgot, we're at a fucking IHOP.

117
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,938
Well, it's my decision and it's final,
so how about a toast?

118
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,942
- This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Come on, Phil. Where you going?

119
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,569
I just don't get it.
He's getting married in Thailand.

120
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,607
That's great for him, but what about us?
You're just selfish.

121
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,741
Come on, sweetheart.

122
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,118
Shame on you.

123
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,246
Don't worry, Stu.
I will stand up for you no matter what.

124
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,705
Thank you.

125
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,792
But you gotta help me out
with this Alan thing.

126
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,376
SID: Guys, I can't tell you
how much this means.

127
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,046
Alan's been waiting for the invite
ever since he got wind of the wedding.

128
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,259
I'm sure he has.

129
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,642
Yeah, he's been standing outside
by the mailbox every day.

130
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,474
- Wow, that's rough.
- Yeah. I, uh ...

131
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:18,142
I'm not quite sure he ever left Vegas,
you know? He really needs this.

132
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,477
[KNOCKS ON Doom

133
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,815
ALAN:
What?

134
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,357
Sweetie, it's Pa Pa. You have visitors.

135
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,323
Go in slowly,
give him a chance to acclimate.

136
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,331
DOUG:
Hey, Alan.

137
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,788
Hey, guys.

138
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,457
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, bud.

139
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,336
Uh... Uh, you guys wanna come in?

140
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,718
- Sure.
- Yeah, absolutely.

141
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,007
- Hey.
- Hey.

142
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,296
Hey.

143
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,800
- Hey, Stu.
- Okay. See you on the court in half...

144
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,929
Pretty cool room, Alan.

145
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,645
Oh, thanks, Phil. My dad pays my rent.

146
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,525
Alan, what the fuck?

147
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,187
We were supposed to delete these.
You made a promise.

148
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,233
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell?

149
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,277
I'm not cool with this at all.
You can't have these.

150
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,329
PHIL: Ha, ha.
- Chillax, Stu. Nobody ever comes in here.

151
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,081
Total violation of trust.

152
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,368
Mother, I'm done with my lunch.
It's just sitting here.

153
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,706

154
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,962
Sorry, honey. I 'll be right up.

155
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,044
ALAN: Can't believe you stopped by.
This is cool.

156
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,958
Wait a second. AI, is that Mr. Chow?

157
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,173
Yeah. We still keep in touch.

158
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,966
Stu.

159
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,382
- The guy that kidnapped us?
- He didn't kidnap us.

160
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,300
He kidnapped Black Doug. Remember?

161
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,060
It was a whole big misunderstanding.
He's actually quite charming.

162
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,391

163
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,057
- Alan, he's a criminal.
- Excuse me, boys.

164
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,941
- Hi, Linda.
LINDA: Hi, Dougie.

165
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,979
I guess we don't do dessert any more.
I didn't get that memo.

166
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,364
Well, I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

167
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,733
Would a cupcake kill you?

168
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,996
- I don't think this was a good idea.
- Uh, Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

169
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,791
Stu would like to invite you
to his wedding.

170
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,660
Well, only if you're not busy.

171
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,627
Stu.

172
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,914
Well, maybe the Jonas Brothers
are in town.

173
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,333
No. They're in Raleigh-Durham
that weekend.

174
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,672
STU:
Mm.

175
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,715
Are you really being serious, Stu?
You're inviting me?

176
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,225
Yeah, why not? Could be fun, right?

177
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,104
- Phil, are you going?
- Of course.

178
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,278
Then it will be fun.

179
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,621
STU: Ah!
- Whoa, what the fuck are you doing, man?

180
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,541
It's my immunizations.
This is the last day I can do it.

181
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,957
That's supposed to be done
by a registered nurse.

182
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,623
I am a nurse. I'm just not registered.

183
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,758
Oh, Stu, look at this.

184
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,760
I bought this because I thought of you.

185
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,833
STU: Hey, there he is.
- Hey, Stu.

186
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,503
- Teddy. What's up? How are you?
TEDDY: Good to see you, man.

187
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,638
STU: All right.
- Who's this guy, Stu?

188
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,720
This is Teddy, Lauren's little brother.

189
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,635
Goes to Stanford. Premed.
This is Phil, Alan and Doug.

190
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,432
DOUG: Hey, nice to meet you, man.
- Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

191
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,267
TEDDY: I'm...
- Uh, he's 17. Kind of a genius.

192
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,901
Actually, I'm 16.

193
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,439
And I'm not a genius. My dad just had me
take the entrance exams early.

194
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,278
Because you're a genius.

195
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,202
- So, what are you, a doctor?
- No. Not yet. I'm premed.

196
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,989
Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser?

197
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,409
- Yeah.
- Well, he turned out to be a gay.

198
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,294
- Alan.
- It's true. I read it in Teen People.

199
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,582
Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna grab a book
or something for the plane.

200
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,840
You guys want anything?

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,047
- No, thanks.
DOUG: I'm good.

202
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,882
I would actually love a Smartwater.

203
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,258
Cool.

204
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,514
Thanks.

205
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,719
- Whats the matter with you? He's 16.
- Yeah, Alan. Take it easy.

206
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,728
I'm a little confused.
Is he here just to see us off or what?

207
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,060
- How does this work?
- How does what work?

208
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,191
Is that person coming to the wedding?

209
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,905
Yes, Alan. My bride's little brother
is coming to the wedding.

210
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,315
Is that okay with you?

211
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,156
Well, it's just the first time I've heard of it.
You could have paged me.

212
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,618

213
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,659
Don't overreact. it's gonna be fine.

214
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,330
Hey. Mind if I sit?

215
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,672
- Wolf pack only. Find another chair.
- There's no wolf pack, Alan.

216
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,053
- Come on.
- It's no problem. I can find...

217
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,886
- Don't be ridiculous. You're sitting here.
- Careful. That's a Louis...

218
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,926
That is a Louis Vuitton.

219
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,478
TEDDY:
Thanks.

220
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,070
That's a nice neck roll.

221
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,404
Thanks. You can use it if you want.

222
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,277
Okay.

223
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,684
LAUREN;
Baby! Hi! on, my God!

224
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,443
STU:
Ah.

225
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,364
- How was your trip?
- It was long, but good.

226
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:49,954
STU: This is so absolutely beautiful.
Thank you so much.

227
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,208
Of course.

228
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,620
Between Teddy and me,
you must be pretty excited.

229
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,164
Pretty soon you'll have two doctors
in the family. Ha, ha.

230
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:00,669
You have to realize that in my country, we
don't consider dentist to be real doctors.

231
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,087
Dad.

232
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,675
Okay.

233
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,593
Anyway, I have to go and talk to Teddy
about his cello performance tonight.

234
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,055
See you.

235
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,722
- Ouch.
- I'm so sorry.

236
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,270
Your dad's kind of obsessed
with your brother.

237
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,356
LAUREN:
Teddy is my dad's prized possession.

238
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,486
It's always been that way.

239
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,782
He'll warm up. I promise. Okay?

240
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,819
ALAN: If you just fax it over to me,
I'll pick it up from concierge.

241
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,408
Okay. Ha, ha. Thanks, Pa Pa.

242
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,572
Bye-bye.

243
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,663
That was, uh, my dad.
I'm a stay-at-home son.

244
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,874
We were discussing your wedding gift.
He's sparing no expense.

245
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:39,166
Oh, that's so unnecessary.

246
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,051
I've been, uh, meaning to ask.
I noticed it's a fishing village.

247
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,212
Is there a Long John Silver's
on the island?

248
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,222
You know, no, I don't think so.
I'm so sorry.

249
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,760
But we are actually sewing
some great fresh seafood.

250
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,680
- Better than Long John's'?
- Yes.

251
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,099
I'll be the judge of that.
Enjoy your evening.

252
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,109
You too. Okay.

253
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:07,699

254
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,474
All right.

255
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,692
Thank you, Teddy.

256
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,117
The hands of a brilliant musician...

257
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,495
and one day, a great surgeon.

258
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,290
I admit it.

259
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,168
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

260
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,455
[STU SNICKERS
AND ALL CHUCKLE]

261
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,090
He seemed unattractive.

262
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,173
He lacked intelligence and imagination.

263
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,427
He was missing that spark
you look for in a man.

264
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,812
But then I look into Stu's eyes.

265
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,349
He reminded me of my sweet brother,
Chaiyo.

266
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,022
For those who do not know...

267
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,188
Chaiyo is learning-disabled
and lives in a group home.

268
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,027

269
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,203
But Chaiyo loves chok.

270
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,034
And that's when I realized...

271
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,573

272
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,368
Stu is chok.

273
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,373
What's chok?

274
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,874
Chok is soft white rice
in lukewarm water.

275
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,294
It has no taste.

276
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,806
We feed it to small baby
and very old people.

277
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,727
It is nourishment
that everyone can digest.

278
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,221
The world needs chok.

279
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,482
Just as the world needs people like Stu.

280
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,822
To my sweet daughter and Stu.
Congratulations.

281
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,359
PHIL: Hear, hear.
DOUG: Cheers, guys.

282
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,739
And now I believe that Teddy
has something to say.

283
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,127
Sit down. I got this.

284
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,753
Sit down, boy.

285
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,208
That was, uh, a great speech, sir.

286
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:31,763
I like the comparisons between, uh,
Stu and rice.

287
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,684
I've also prepared a few words.

288
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,770
"Hey, everybody, here are some fun facts.

289
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,687
The population in Thailand
is 63 million people.

290
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,022
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

291
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,444
Its chief exports are textiles,
footwear and rice.

292
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:55,863
Each year, approximately 13,000 people
are killed in car accidents in Thailand.

293
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,871
- The climate in Thailand is..."
DOUG: Alan, uh...

294
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,580
Alan, why don't you skip
to the last card there, buddy?

295
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,536
Okay. Sorry.

296
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,668

297
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,459
"None of you know Stu like I do."

298
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,549
Not you. Not you.

299
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,427
Not you. Not you.

300
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,887
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

301
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,771
No one.

302
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,103
"I can't even tell you
what we've been through...

303
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,145
because we made a pact
more important than blood.

304
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,063
What I can tell you is this:

305
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,278
This is not Stu's first marriage.

306
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,786
There was a whore in Las Vegas
a couple of years ago..."

307
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,823
You can sit down, bud. You can sit down.

308
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,543
- It was good. I did good, though.
- Oh, God, you killed it.

309
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,454
- Okay. Thanks, Phil.
- Sit down. Yeah.

310
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,589
In your face.

311
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,100
Well, that was exactly as painful
as I expected it to be.

312
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,139
Ha, ha. Sorry.

313
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,525
Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing?

314
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,439
- Ha, ha, ha. Very funny, Phil.
- Be nice, Phil. He's extra sensitive tonight.

315
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,701
Get over it. He's your father-in-law.
He's supposed to hate you.

316
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,032
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

317
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:23,496
You know, I'm really exhausted.
We're just gonna go upstairs and crash.

318
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,410
I spoke with the manager.
He'll let us have a beach bonfire.

319
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,329
That sounds fun.

320
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,500
Nah. I'm good.

321
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,712
He's tired.

322
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,754
Stu. One drink with your friends.
They came all this way.

323
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,641
- I just wanna hang out with you.
- Oh, come on, just go and do me a favor:

324
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,018
Take Teddy with you.

325
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,678
He never gets to have any fun.

326
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,892
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

327
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,557
- All right. One drink.
LAUREN: Perfect.

328
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,725
- See?
- You win.

329
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,394
STU: See you later.
LAUREN: Have fun.

330
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,359
STEPHANIE: Got your key?
- Uh, yep. Got it right there.

331
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,401
- I'll see you in 20 minutes.

332
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,372
My Uncle Roger said
that he once saw a albino polar bear.

333
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,408
Really? Polar bears are white.

334
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,417
How would he know if it's an albino?

335
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,042
This one was black.

336
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,506
Did you ever think
maybe it was just a black bear?

337
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,757
Whatevs.

338
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,602
- Okay. Here we go.
DOUG: All right.

339
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,808
- American beer.
DOUG: Let's do it.

340
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,439
Sealed bottles.

341
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,099
Thank you. All right.

342
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,110
Um, I'm not really old enough to drink.

343
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,022
Yeah, it's illegal.
Be a shame if somebody reported you.

344
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,904
Nobody's reporting anybody.

345
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,114
It's fine, Teddy. Have a little fun.

346
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,200
ALAN: Careful.
PHIL: What? Oh.

347
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:46,783
What is this? Roasting marshmallows?
Nice touch.

348
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,453
DOUG: That was Alan's idea.
- Oh. Good thinking, Alan.

349
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,708
You know, I gotta hand it to you, Stu.
This place is paradise.

350
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,172
Not bad, right?

351
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,430
And I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm actually jealous of you.

352
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,637
I mean, Lauren is an angel.

353
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,801
Yeah, she really is amazing.

354
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,220
Wow, you guys are sweet.

355
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:12,358
Not big breasts on her,
but still, solid rack for an Asian.

356
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,984
Sorry, Teddy, but it's true.

357
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,523
That's okay.

358
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:21,068
That is just wildly inappropriate.
And yet I'm really glad you're here.

359
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,735
All you guys.

360
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,153
Even you, Alan.

361
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,995
It means a lot that you made the trip.
Thank you.

362
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,500
Wouldn't miss it, buddy.

363
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,496
Great. Now can we have our
one fucking beer, Dad?

364
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,788
Mm-hm.

365
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,966
All right. Toast.

366
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,172
Come on, stand up, guys.

367
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,670
Come over here, Alan.

368
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,971
To Lauren and Stu.

369
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,226
- You did it, buddy.
- You sure did.

370
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,853
ALL:
Cheers.

371
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,502

372
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,474
What the hell?

373
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,113

374
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,370

375
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,575

376
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,463

377
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,969
What?

378
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,306
ALAN:
No.

379
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,140

380
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,330
Phil?

381
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,546
I think it's happened again.

382
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,336
Alan, what the fuck did you do?

383
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,343
I didn't do anything. I swear to God.

384
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,263
Your hair is gone.

385
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,391
No, no.

386
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,184
UP...

387
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,932

388
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,146
Where the fuck are we?

389
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,028

390
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,315

391
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,153
Phil, I'm scared.

392
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,662

393
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,706

394
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,883
Stu, come on, get up. We got a situation.

395
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,129

396
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,181
Oh, holy shit.

397
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,854
Where are we?

398
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,394
Oh, my God, Alan. Your head.

399
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,396
No, your head.

400
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,065
He's bald.

401
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,030
Stu, you're gonna freak out,
but it's gonna be okay.

402
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,320
Why? What's...? Is it my teeth?

403
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,703
- It's not your teeth.
ALAN: No.

404
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,206
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

405
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,492
- Did you check the bottoms?
- I did.

406
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,917
Oh, my God.

407
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,257
What the fuck? Ow!

408
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,424
That's good.
Why don't you try to wash it off?

409
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,930
STU:
It's not coming off!

410
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,850
This is a real tattoo!

411
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,390
Alan, what did you do?
Did you roofie me?

412
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,898
- I didn't do anything.
- Stu, he swore to God.

413
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,726
What happened?

414
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,019

415
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,233

416
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,568
PHIL: Oh, jeez!
STU: What is it?! What is it?!

417
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,699
Help! Back there! What are you'?!

418
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,572
ALAN:
Did you see that jump?

419
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,454
- Oh, what the hell?!
- Oh, it's a monkey.

420
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,707
Look at the cute little vest.
Hi, little monkey.

421
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,618
Alan. Alan.

422
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,578
Butthole.

423
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:25,792

424
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,955

425
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,169
- Phone.
- Hi, monkey.

426
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,426
Look, Alan, Alan, go find the phone.

427
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,965
I got it.

428
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,635
Doug. Doug. Where the hell are you?

429
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,596
I'm at breakfast. By the pool.
You guys coming down or what?

430
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,387
Oh, Jesus. Thank God. Doug's fine.

431
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,806
Stu, Doug's fine! He's at the resort.

432
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,645
Why aren't we at the resort?

433
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,354
What's going on? Where are you?

434
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,063
I don't know, man. We woke up
in some shithole room in some city.

435
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,483
DOUG:
Oh, God. What city?

436
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,653
I don't know, Doug. Fucking Asia Town.

437
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,120
I don't know. I told you.

438
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,997
Where are we?

439
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,079
PHIL:
I have no fucking idea.

440
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,497
ALAN: Hey, Stu.
- What?

441
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,004
Check this out.

442
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,504
You ever seen anything like this?

443
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,854
- What is that?
ALAN: Careful!

444
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,357
Might be a spider's nest.
I've tangled with those before.

445
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:32,238
I don't get it, man. I mean,
we each had one beer last night, right?

446
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,320
- I mean, you too.
- Yeah, but I left early, remember?

447
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,029
PHIL:
I don't remember shit.

448
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,695
Tracy wasn't feeling well.
She came down to get me.

449
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,993
Wait a second. Is Teddy with you guys?

450
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,328
PHIL: Teddy? What?
What are you talking about?

451
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,869
They've been looking for him
all morning.

452
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,709
- Teddy went to Stanford, right?
DOUG: Yeah. Why?

453
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,547
Fuck!

454
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,380

455
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,884
I just found his finger.

456
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,924
DOUG:
What?

457
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,049
I just found his fucking finger, Doug.

458
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,637
Phil, what is going on?

459
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,228
All right. All right, all right, all right.

460
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,061
This is what we're gonna do.
Tell the girls that we woke up early...

461
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,225
and went on a fishing trip.
That's where we are.

462
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,486
- Right.
- All right, stay by the phone.

463
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,359
Shit!

464
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,786
PHIL:
All right, we got a little bit of a problem.

465
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,744
What is that?

466
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,292
We don't know.

467
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,995
Is it a worm?

468
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,381
It's a mushroom.

469
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,758
Yeah, shiitake.

470
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,805
Monkey, taste it. What do you think?
Is it shiitake?

471
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,215
He can't understand you.

472
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,926
STU:
He just did.

473
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,768
Why is he pulling on it?

474
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,554
He's probably hungry.

475
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,689
Wait a second. Is that...?

476
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,772
CHOW:
Aah! What the fuck, man?!

477
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,232
Tell that gay monkey
to leave my shit alone!

478
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,692
Chow'?!

479
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,407
CHOW:
You fucking crazy.

480
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,119
Ah, so fucking light in here.

481
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,449
Alan.

482
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,572
Grab me my sunglasses.

483
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:10,620
- It's great to see you, Leslie.
- Mm. Nice to see you too, my little hobo.

484
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,709
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

485
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,546
Alan called me a few days ago
and invited me to wedding.

486
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,881
- Excuse me?
- What? He's my plus one.

487
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,138
You didn't have a plus one.
It's $200 a plate.

488
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,641
Guys, guys. Just focus, okay?
Chow, what happened?

489
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,475
You guys texted me, said you fucked up
and looking to party.

490
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,810

491
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,731
I picked you up in my boat
and I brought you here to Bangkok.

492
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,865
And we had a sick night, bitches!

493
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,324
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second, Chow.

494
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,238
Chow, we're in Bangkok?

495
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:50,126
Holler! City of squalor!

496
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,626
Do you know how I got this tattoo?

497
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:55,130
Uh, yeah. From a fucking tattoo guy.

498
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,791
Come on, Stewie.
Use that big Jewish brain.

499
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,756
Hey, what's the monkey holding?

500
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,420

501
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,051
That's a finger!

502
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,433
PHIL:
Stu, I got some bad news.

503
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,720
Teddy was with us last night.

504
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,392
That's his finger.

505
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,978
Teddy... Teddy's dead?

506
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:18,191
Ha, ha. Teddy not dead.
He party with us all night.

507
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,525
PHIL:
Well, then where is he?

508
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,281
Don't you remember anything?

509
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,860
- No!
- No. Nothing, Chow.

510
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,996
Okay, okay. I explain it all, okay?

511
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,700
Just let me do one bump,
get my head straight.

512
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,868
Come to papa.

513
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,046
- Okay.
- That's a big...

514
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:45,173
You ready for craziest fucking story of...

515
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,895
Chow.

516
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,737
Mr. Chow, are you okay?

517
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,696
You gotta be kidding me.

518
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,499
Fuck, he's dead.

519
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,748

520
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,507
- Help!
- Stu.

521
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,009
- Help! Help!
- Stu, shut up.

522
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,340
Stu, shut up. Stu, shut up!

523
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,550

524
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,510
- Call an ambulance!
PHIL: Shut up!

525
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,677
He's dead. Look, if someone comes and
finds a dead body and a pile of cocaine...

526
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,312
we'll spend the rest of our lives
in a Thai prison. Shh!

527
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,103
Alan. Alan, please stop crying.

528
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,021

529
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:44,281
All right. All right!
I just need a second to figure this out.

530
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,647
STU: This is the worst idea ever.
What the fuck is this place?

531
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,531
ALAN: "Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
Its population is 12 million people."

532
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,283
Alan, put the cards away and help.

533
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,986

534
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,452
Elevator.

535
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,788
ALAN:
I'll get the button. I'll get the button.

536
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,623
What the fuck is the deal
with this monkey?

537
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,837
ALAN:
That monkey gets it.

538
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,928
STU: Come on.
- Oh, fuck. No, the power's out.

539
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,464
- We gotta take the stairs.
- Ah, fuck!

540
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,136
Come on.

541
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,521
Here it is.

542
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:03,268
Feet first, feet first. I've done this before.

543
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,816
STU:
Alan.

544
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,862
ALAN:
All right. Careful. Careful.

545
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,206

546
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,839
- Stu.
STU: What?

547
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,972
We still have to find Teddy.

548
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,058
Oh, God.

549
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:47,896
The roof!

550
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,814
- Teddy!
- Teddy!

551
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:54,202
- Teddy! Teddy!
- Teddy! Teddy!

552
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,620
ALAN;
Teddy!

553
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,749
- You guys see anything?
- No.

554
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:09,339
Come on. Where are you, buddy?

555
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,010
He's not here.

556
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,223
I can't believe this is happening again.

557
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,938
Okay. Look, we'll handle this.
You get back there.

558
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,605
You tell them that Alan and I
got drunk with him, we're still partying.

559
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,990
- You gotta go get married.
- No, no.

560
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,776
I'm not going back without Teddy.

561
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,787
It's Lauren's little brother,
he's lost, he's injured.

562
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,867
If I fuck this up...

563
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,661
I lose everything.

564
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,460
Okay.

565
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,130
All right.

566
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,883
Alan, check your pockets.

567
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,468
- What?
- You know the drill.

568
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,804
Come on, there might be clues.

569
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,267
- Check your phones. Numbers, texts.
- Oh, that's a good idea.

570
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,723
- I got nothing. Fuck.
- Me neither.

571
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,812
- I got a text from Chow.
- What time?

572
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,977
Uh, 10:00 last night.

573
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,646
What's it say?

574
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,531
"On my way, niggas."

575
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,816
Oh, niggas. Okay.

576
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,280
Hip-hop.

577
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:22,992
We are so fucked.

578
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,332
- Hey, Phil.
- What?

579
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,337
Look who's back. Hi.

580
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,001
We gotta get you out of the sun.
Get you a hat.

581
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,966
Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,799
STU: Phil, I really think we should go
to the American Consulate.

583
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,718
PHIL: For what? Report a dead body
we shoved into an ice machine?

584
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,855
Are we gonna keep walking in circles?
That's real productive.

585
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,812
I'm trying to figure this out.
Your attitude is not helping.

586
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,103
Well, I'm sorry. It's 100 degrees
and we don't have a plan.

587
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,363
And all we've done is buy him hats
and sodas.

588
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,864
What? it's a bag of Fanta.

589
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,617
- All right, what do you wanna do, Stu?
- I don't know.

590
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,370
- Then stop yelling at me like it's my fault.
- It is your fault!

591
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,529

592
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,369
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

593
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,704
Shit. Shut up, it's Doug. Talk to me.

594
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,041
Just got off the phone with Bangkok P.D.
They got him. He's okay.

595
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,378
Oh. Thank God. Doug found him.

596
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,213
- What happened?
DOUG: He got arrested.

597
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,219
- Arrested? For what?
- Disorderly conduct.

598
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,551
- Seriously?
DOUG: Yeah. He's okay, though.

599
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:23,264
They'll release him to you, no questions
asked. No one here has to know.

600
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,474
He's at the, uh...

601
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,811
"Ratchawang Police Station."

602
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,226
Okay. Okay,
I'll call you when we get there.

603
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,147
- Teddy's in jail, but fine. We gotta get a cab.
- Okay. All right.

604
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,904
OFFICER: Yes, I have his paperwork here.
PHIL: Okay.

605
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,073
OFFICER: He has been cleared.
PHIL: Sounds good.

606
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,038
OFFICER: Of course.
PHIL: Thank you.

607
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,703
We're good, we're good.
They're processing for release.

608
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,291

609
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,752
Yeah, they threw him in the drunk tank.
He's fine.

610
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:57,052
Sixteen years old, spent a night in jail.
Can you imagine?

611
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,378

612
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,092
We love to party.

613
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,015
Here we go.

614
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,105
- Wait, who's this fucking guy?
- Teddy Srisai.

615
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,766
What...? No, no, no. I'm so...

616
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,559
It's the wrong guy. Sir.

617
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,773
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Uh, there's been a mistake.

618
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,610
He brought the wrong guy.
That's not Teddy.

619
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,616
Of course it is.
We have his IDs and everything.

620
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,283
These were in his pockets
when we made the arrest.

621
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,571
They were in his pocket?

622
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,787
Excuse me, sir.

623
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,123
How did you get this stuff?

624
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,080
Hello?

625
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,882
OFFICER:
Teddy doesn't speak.

626
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,385
We tried English, Thai, Chinese.
Nothing.

627
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,966
Let me ask you something.

628
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:45,600
Does he look like he works out at
Bally Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

629
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,311
Look, we arrest a lot of people.

630
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,644
We cannot analyze everything. All right?

631
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,980
Well, what do you expect us to do
with this guy?

632
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,269
Not my problem.

633
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,064
Hey, guys?

634
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,483
I think he knows us.

635
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,322
Hi. Hello.

636
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:11,251
Do you know where our friend is?!
Teddy! He's missing!

637
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,503
Stu, forget it. The guy's worthless.

638
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,006
He knows something.
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

639
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,796
What if he just doesn't understand?

640
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,839
Uh, I'll act it out.
Yeah, like charades. Watch.

641
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,257
- Two words.
- Is it a movie?

642
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,185
This is not for you, Alan.

643
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,349
American teenager in Asia.

644
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,643
Karate Kid with Jaden Smith.

645
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,696
It's easy because
you were talking through it.

646
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,610
Stu, it's a waste of time.

647
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,696
Just leave this fucking guy here.

648
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,613
Oh, here's something. "There are
500,000 monks living in Thailand.

649
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,875
It is not uncommon for some monks
to take a vow of silence...

650
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,378
at the age of 8."
- There you go.

651
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,255
- Is there anything else in that envelope?
- No, it's empty.

652
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:00,841
Whoa, hang on.

653
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,471
A drink card from White Lion Bar,
Bangkok?

654
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,141
Worth a shot.

655
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,854
PHIL:
Jesus Christ. ls this the right street?

656
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,229
STU:
That's what it says.

657
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,062

658
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,569
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is the White Lion.

659
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,905
What the fuck happened here?

660
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,411
Holy shit.

661
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,909

662
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,336
PHIL: Oh, okay. Just keep walking. Yeah.
STU: Okay. Yeah, we should probably...

663
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,622

664
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,758
STU: Ah!
- All right. it's okay.

665
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,256
STU:
What the fuck is going on here?

666
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,924
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, check it out.

667
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,678
Holy shit. Stu, look.

668
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,266
That's my face.

669
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,181
Go, go, go.

670
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,103
Nice work, Alan.

671
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,021
PHIL: Hello?
- Be with you in a minute.

672
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,576
Excuse me.

673
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,453
Oh, look who it is.

674
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,038
So, what do you think?

675
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,369
What? I'm sorry?

676
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,534
The tattoo? You love it?

677
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,541
Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

678
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,798
No refunds. Get the fuck out.

679
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,879
- Wait a second.
- Read the sign.

680
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,637
We don't want a refund.
We just have a couple of questions.

681
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,924
Trying to figure out
what went down last night.

682
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,387
"What went down"?

683
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,269
Look what you did outside.
Half the neighborhood went down.

684
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,475
We did that?

685
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,641
You don't remember getting into a bar fight
at the White Lion?

686
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,559
Starting a full-on fucking riot?

687
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:45,230
No, sir. We don't remember anything.

688
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,278

689
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,703
Hold this. Oh, boy.

690
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,327
Check this out.

691
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,084
[PEOPLE SHOUTING AND
SIRENS WAILING ON PHONE]

692
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,666
Holy shit.

693
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,580

694
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,585
Fuck the police!

695
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,503
Fuck the police!

696
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,046

697
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,715

698
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,303
There's Teddy. He was with us.

699
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,399
PHIL:
Jesus Christ.

700
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,489
That's when the cops arrived,
started cracking skulls.

701
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,950
I took you guys
and hid you in the shop here.

702
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,996
Then you decided to get a tattoo.
Cried like a little bitch.

703
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,705
This kid's fucking 9 years old.
He's got balls twice your size.

704
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,208
- Show him your balls, man.
PHIL: No, no, no. That's okay.

705
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,379
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy.
Have you seen him?

706
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,513
Not since last night. What happened?

707
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:56,017
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister
tomorrow and we kind of lost him.

708
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,728
Oh, well. Then fuck it.

709
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,355
What do you mean, "fuck it"?

710
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:06,227
Bangkok has him now
and she'll never let him go.

711
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,067
You hear that? Huh?

712
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,197
- Is this what you wanted? Happy now?
ALAN: Phil.

713
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:14,156
You're wasting your time.
These monks take their vow shit seriously.

714
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,490
Look at this.

715
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,702
That's the sign of the Chiang Mei
monastery just outside of town.

716
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,705
Maybe somebody over there
can get him to talk.

717
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,874

718
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,210
Can we just go over this one more time?
You got the beer from...?

719
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,595
The hotel bar.
They gave me a sealed case.

720
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,723
- Right. But who gave it to you?
- The bartender.

721
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,429
Right. Okay.

722
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,765
And then you brought them out
and I opened them.

723
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,431
Yeah, and Doug had one and he was fine,
so it's not the beer.

724
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,858
STU: So, what the hell happened?
PHIL: I have no idea.

725
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:49,021
Hey, guys. Check it out,
he's got a Chinese boner.

726
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,440
Alan, come on. Cut it out.

727
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,199

728
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,859

729
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,869
ALAN:
The monkey is a pervert.

730
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,905
Come on, that is so wrong.

731
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,790
Hey, don't stop, monkey, keep doing it.

732
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,122

733
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:13,132
When a monkey nibbles on a penis,
it's funny in any language.

734
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,469
Oh, keep doing it!

735
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,143
All right. Thank you.

736
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,804
We good?

737
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,858
ALAN:
Bye, Shannon. Bye, Lil Wayne.

738
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,902
PHIL:
Wow.

739
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,655
So beautiful.

740
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,871
What is this, a P.F. Chang's?

741
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,705
STU:
Ah, they're meditating.

742
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,629
- Such a peaceful people.
PHIL: Yeah.

743
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,464
Knock, knock! Hello?!

744
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:57,506
PHIL: Alan, Alan, show some respect.
Don't get up, guys.

745
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,425
We brought one of your guys back.

746
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,344
He's really funny.
He's really nice and cool.

747
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,231
Hi, how you doing?
Uh, are you the one in charge?

748
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,437

749
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,022
- Hey! Aah!
- Excuse me. Ow!

750
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,437
- Wait! Ah!
ALAN: stop in

751
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,355
PHIL:
Just calm down! Aah!

752
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,614
Hold on! Ah!

753
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,151
It's because" Ow! We're talking! Ah!

754
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,490
Stop talking. Goddamn it!

755
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:21,996
Don't! Stop!

756
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,371
Wait! it's me!

757
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:24,657
Stop hitting me!

758
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,871
Oh, I get it.

759
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,952

760
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,047
No talk. No talk.

761
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,551
Shh. Okay. We no talk.

762
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,594
Okay.

763
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,054

764
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:06,325
Late last night, you climbed the walls
of our monastery...

765
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:12,247
shouting out question about love,
marriage and the meaning of life.

766
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:19,175
Poor Brother Han was meditating alone
in the garden and you took him.

767
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,840
Oh, my God.

768
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,183
We kidnapped a monk.

769
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,852
Uh, we live an alternative lifestyle.

770
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:31,938
And we are so sorry about that,
but we weren't ourselves last night.

771
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,773
Yup, things kind of spun out
of control a little bit.

772
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:38,940
But there's a boy who's missing
and hurt.

773
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,484
Can you find out if he knows
where our friend is?

774
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,905
Brother Han took a vow of silence
many years ago.

775
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,073
It would be useless to try.

776
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:51,619
Well, maybe he can write down
what happened on a piece of paper.

777
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,460
Actually, that would be cheating.
Right, Grand Wizard?

778
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,466
- Alan.
- I'm afraid Fatty is right.

779
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,627
See? What?

780
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:03,219
None us will ever know what
Brother Han knows.

781
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,633
Oh, all right.

782
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,928
So much for holy people.
Bunch of bald assholes. Come on, let's go.

783
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,815
Hey, you know what? FYI, you may wanna
put some signs up that say "no talking"...

784
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,816
before you unleash your dragon.
STU: Yeah, that was a little rough.

785
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:19,230
You're welcome for bringing him back safe.
You know, we found him in a drunk tank.

786
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,115
STU:
We did take him in the first place.

787
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,071
PHIL:
Come on, guys, let's go.

788
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,323
Wait.

789
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,663
The Buddha teach:

790
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,625
Every memory lives somewhere
deep within.

791
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:36,505
Perhaps you should bring your question
to the garden of meditation.

792
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,550
- Did you understand a word he said?
- About two-thirds.

793
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,676
Something about the garden
of meditation?

794
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,760
No, he said he's farting
because of his medication.

795
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,340
I get that.

796
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,149
I don't remember anything.

797
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,318
Do you?

798
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,104
No. I got nothing.

799
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,573
Alan?

800
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,284
Alan?

801
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,821

802
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,708
LU: Every memory lives somewhere
deep within.

803
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,710
SID: Sweetie?
ALAN: What?

804
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,542
SID:
You have visitors.

805
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,547
- Hey, Alan.
- Hey, guys.

806
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,379
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, buddy.

807
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:24,045
- Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.
- Is this true, Stuart?

808
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,468
Yeah, why not? it'll be fun.

809
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,218
- What the fuck?
PHIL: To Lauren and Stu.

810
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,728
ALL:
Cheers.

811
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,854
PHIL: Chow?
CHOW: We had a sick night, bitches!

812
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,895
PHIL: Yeah!
DOUG: Alan, what the fuck?

813
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,233

814
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,069
ALAN:
Ls that person coming to the wedding?

815
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,608
STU:
There is no wolf pack.

816
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,448
PHIL: Alan, don't do that!
ALAN: "The population in Thailand is ..."

817
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:52,081
And we're the three best friends
That anybody could have

818
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,420
MAN:
Hey!

819
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,539

820
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:04,085
STU:
Yeah! Fuck the police! Fuck the police!

821
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,140
I know where to go.

822
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,937
What do you think, Alan?

823
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,105
Uh, this is the place.

824
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,569
Come on, let's go.

825
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,905

826
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,199
I don't remember any of this.

827
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,788
Yeah, Alan,
are you sure this is the place?

828
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,953
Yeah, pretty sure.

829
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,387
Bros, finally!

830
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,220
Is he coming or what?
I've been waiting all day for him.

831
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,642
Uh, I'm sorry. Waiting for who?

832
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,394
Chow, that dick-ass fuck.

833
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,310
- Why, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

834
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,271
Okay, good. Look at this.

835
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,312
Look what I bring for him.
Check it out, huh? Huh?

836
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,486
- No, no, no.
- $6000, American.

837
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,742
Wow, it looks so real.

838
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,447

839
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,079
Sorry. Ahem. Sorry.

840
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,744
Alan! What the fuck?!

841
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,665
It's okay! it's okay.
The gun, very sensitive. Very sensitive.

842
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,674
- Everybody okay?
DANCER: Yeah, okay.

843
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,087
Okay? Then get the fuck back to work!

844
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,470
Come on! Music, please!

845
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,676

846
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,307
Who has my $6000?

847
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:37,265
No, no, no. That's Chow's deal.
We got nothing to do with that.

848
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,180
Un-fucking-believable, man.

849
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:43,396
This guy, if he backs out again,
this shit is gonna catch up to him, okay?

850
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,859
He's made a lot of enemies in this town
and now they're your enemies.

851
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,147
That's not fair!

852
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,988
Okay, listen.
We're just looking for a little kid.

853
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,868
- Two thousand dollars.
- What?!

854
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,871
I don't know. Maybe more.
How young you want this kid to be?

855
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,034
No! No, no, no. Sorry.
You misunderstood.

856
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,545
We're looking for our friend,
16 years old, Teddy?

857
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,378
Teddy?
Yeah, he was here with you guys last night.

858
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,463
He was?
You remember if he left with us?

859
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,176
You were in the corner all night
with Kimmy. I didn't see you leave.

860
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,181
Kimmy? Kimmy? Is she here?

861
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,560
Yeah, she's in the back.
She just came for her shift. Go talk to her.

862
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,767
Listen, I'm sorry about everything
that happened.

863
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,102
Pay attention what
I'm gonna talk to you now.

864
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:27,520
When you see Chow,
you tell him Samir says hello.

865
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,654
- Okay.
- But do it like that, okay?

866
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,736
Hello. Like threatening.

867
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,196
Like ironic.

868
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,535
- Hello.
- Okay.

869
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,661
- Hello.
- Hello.

870
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,201
- Hello.
- More O. Hello.

871
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,415
Hello.

872
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,171
Go away, go away.
Fucking make me crazy.

873
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,380
Of course I remember him.
He was buying shots for everyone.

874
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,921
Nice kid. His parents must be so proud.

875
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,510
Yeah. You have no idea.

876
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,175
Okay, so do you remember
if he left with us?

877
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:02,722
Yeah, you all were leaving together,
but you almost forgot this one right here.

878
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,311
- Right, superstar?
- Hmm.

879
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:09,854
This one was following me around
like a little puppy dog all night.

880
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,240
Saying how he fall in love with me
and ask me to marry him.

881
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,443

882
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,701
Classic Stu.

883
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,698
- We didn't get married, did we?
- Of course not.

884
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,866
We just had some fun
in the Chardonnay Room.

885
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,544
What, uh... What happens
in the Chardonnay Room?

886
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,626
Let's just stay on task here.

887
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,632
Oh, you know. Dance for him.
He tickle me. We had sex.

888
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,919
- I massage his shoulders.
- Fuck!

889
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:35,463
It's okay. You're not married yet.
It's no big deal.

890
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,757
It's cheating, okay?

891
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:42,224
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.
It's a violation of my moral code.

892
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:45,060
Don't be sad. Stu, you love it.

893
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,896
You were crying,
saying how special it was.

894
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,981
Wait. Ha, ha. I'm sorry, he was crying?

895
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,487
What a baby. He was crying.

896
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:55,741
You should have seen him.
He was so sexy, the way he move around.

897
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,241
I had to ask him slow down
so I don't drop my load too quick.

898
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,832
Load? What load?

899
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,665
Oh, you know. My sperms.

900
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:11,590
Eh, I think your English is off.
You're talking about my sperms.

901
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,297
Where would your sperm come from?

902
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,837
From my balls.

903
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,300
Hold on. Back up.

904
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:20,012
Wait, wait. Are you...?

905
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,643
Hey. You in Bangkok, sweetie.

906
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,849
There's a reason
they don't call it Bangcunt.

907
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,605
STU:
Oh!

908
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,564

909
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,353
Oh, my God.

910
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,738
PHIL:
Wow.

911
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,950
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

912
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:44,203
Come on, Stu. It was beautiful.
We climaxed at the same time.

913
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,454
How's that work?

914
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,712
Shoot my load into you,
you shoot your load on the floor.

915
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,214
- Okay.

916
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,878
In my bottom?

917
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,042

918
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,086
Oh, God.

919
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,761

920
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:07,062
Stu, it's not the end of the world.

921
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,394
I'm sorry, but I am so confused.

922
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,728
I made love to a man with boobies.

923
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:17,569
Listen, I promise you no one's ever
gonna find out about this.

924
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,233
But we just found out about it.

925
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,697
And then we forget. That's what we do.

926
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,739
I've done so much fucked up shit,
and I just forget about it.

927
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:28,535
- You have?
- Yeah. You just forget. It goes away.

928
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,747
That might be harder to go away,
but in time it'll happen.

929
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,756
That's what I'm gonna do.

930
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,088
I'm just gonna forget about it.

931
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,753
- Never happened.
- Right.

932
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,216

933
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:42,757
Phone. Phone. Who is it? Answer.

934
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,425
Lauren's dad.

935
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,888
It just reminded me.

936
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,598
- Answer it.
- I can't.

937
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,514
He might know something about Teddy.
We still have a shot.

938
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:54,561
- Get your head back into the fucking game.

939
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,617
- Hello?
FOHN: Who takes an all-day fishing trip...

940
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,573
the day before a wedding?

941
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:07,080
Yeah, ha, ha.
I guess it was kind of stupid.

942
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,786
Put Teddy on the phone.

943
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,871
- Uh, Teddy's seasick, actually.
FOHN: Seasick?

944
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,711
Teddy's been a maritime deck cadet
since he was 9.

945
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,297
Well, that's weird,
because he's puking everywhere.

946
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,554
I'm gonna tell you something
that you did not know.

947
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,090
I don't like you.

948
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,930
- Yeah, I knew that already.
FOHN: My daughter chooses you...

949
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,094
that's her problem.
- Hey, it's Phil Winnick.

950
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,515
Listen, I apologize. We've been reeling in
some crazy marlin, and I just want...

951
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,274

952
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,147
ALAN: Phil!
STU: Phil!

953
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,311
PHIL:
Jesus.

954
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,571
STU: Phil? You're okay.
PHIL: Fuck me.

955
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,982
Give us back our monkey.

956
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,775
What monkey? Get your own monkey!

957
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,319
Come on, you asshole.
The fucking monkey.

958
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,329
Come on.

959
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,615
Any time, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us.

960
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,124
This is our monkey.

961
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:54,913
Alan, no one's getting shot over
a fucking monkey. Hand him over now.

962
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,252
Oh, God, I never get to keep no monkeys.

963
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,674

964
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,214
Hey, check it out.
He's got a banana on his helmet.

965
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,678
- These guys are the real deal.
PHIL: What's happening?

966
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,845
Hold on. How did this happen?
Do you know where our friend is?

967
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,855
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, 16 years old, Asian kid?

968
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:16,187

969
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,023
No, I don't understand what he said.

970
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,612
What did he say? What did he say?!

971
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,445
He said, "Fuck you and your question."

972
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,154

973
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:26,694
PHIL:
Oh, my arm!

974
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,033
Poor Phil! Phil, are you okay?

975
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:33,409
PHIL:
Oh, I got shot. Fuck! Fuck, guys.

976
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,876
It's all right, Phil. We'll figure this all out
and get the monkey back. I promise.

977
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,006
No one gives a fuck
about the monkey, Alan!

978
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,384
Oh, shit, look at my arm.

979
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,386
What the fuck is going on?!

980
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,139
Stu, am I gonna be okay?
You're a doctor.

981
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,017
I don't know. Let me look, let me look.

982
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,390

983
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,225
What? What?

984
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,890
Stu, come here. No, look at it.

985
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:59,230
Stuart Price, get your ass back over here!

986
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:00,815
STU: You got shot!
PHIL: I know!

987
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,459
PHIL: Hey.
- Yo. You all right?

988
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,373
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

989
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:26,137
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm.
Eight stitches.

990
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,756
Only cost $6. How's that even possible?

991
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,721
How's any of this even possible?

992
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,936
I mean, if I was a foot to my left,
Stu, I'd be dead.

993
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,440
What are we gonna do?

994
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,118
I'm sorry, guys.
This wasn't part of the plan.

995
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,785
What plan, Alan?

996
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,700
I've said too much already.

997
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,795
Alan, what plan?

998
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,139
This is all Teddy's fault.

999
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,800
PHIL:
What are you talking about, Alan?

1000
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,139
Why is he here?
He's not part of the wolf pack.

1001
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,146
Alan, what did you do?

1002
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,434
It's not my fault. Teddy shouldn't have
been sharing from his bag.

1003
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,235
What bag?

1004
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,489
The marshmallows.
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

1005
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:31,151
But it was dark, it was hard to keep track,
and then you almost sat on them.

1006
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,662
I couldn't tell which was which.
It was mayhem.

1007
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,868
What did you do to the marshmallows,
Alan?

1008
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,784
Alan? What did you do?

1009
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:42,705
Well, isn't it obvious?
I spiked them with muscle relaxers.

1010
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,169
And, plus, my ADHD medication.

1011
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,300
- What?!
- You drugged us again?!

1012
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,134
Not you. I just wanted to knock out Teddy
so we could enjoy the weekend.

1013
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:55,972
"Enjoy the weekend"'? Alan, you told me
that you didn't do anything.

1014
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,807
Alan, you swore to God.

1015
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,222
I just wanted things to stay the same.

1016
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,561
Look at my face!

1017
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,351
You ruined my life!

1018
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:05,940
You're not my friend.

1019
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,856
Don't say that, Phil. Are you serious?
Even in America?

1020
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:12,868
- Yes!

1021
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,369
Don't start crying, Alan.

1022
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,030
You're the bearded devil!

1023
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:19,325
You liked it. You smiled at me when
I held up the marshmallows.

1024
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:23,371
Because I like marshmallows,
you fucking psycho!

1025
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:27,341
Hey! Whoa, whoa, hold on! Stop!

1026
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,046
- Guys, guys. Enough.
- Why?!

1027
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,382
Why, Alan? s Why?!

1028
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:34,386
Because we're the three best friends,
remember?

1029
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,216
Remember?

1030
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,557
Stu, that's enough. That's enough.

1031
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,187
Fuck.

1032
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,598

1033
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,563
Guys, we can't fall apart now.
We gotta stick together.

1034
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:55,532
- Alan, what's that written on your belly?
- What? Huh?

1035
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:59,574
"Lebua Hotel. Saturday, 6 p.m."
Did you write that?

1036
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,161
No.

1037
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,832
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

1038
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,164
What about England?
Are we friends there?

1039
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,583
I told you,
it was in the heat of the moment.

1040
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,753
We're still friends, all over the world.

1041
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,638
- Even Great Britain?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

1042
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,514
Well, what about you, Stu?

1043
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,061
We'll see.

1044
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,682
Gentlemen, follow me.

1045
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:29,815
All right.

1046
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:40,952
MAN:
Here you go.

1047
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,077
KINGSLEY:
Well.

1048
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,588
It's about time. Sit down.

1049
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,715
- Come on, sit, sit, sit.
- Okay.

1050
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,210
Wow, you guys look like shit.

1051
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,550
PHIL: Uh, do we know you?
- Hey.

1052
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,935
Take off your fucking hat.
You're in a restaurant, for chrissake.

1053
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,650
Okay, listen. Uh,
we have no clue what's going on here.

1054
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:13,939
You know, they sell a plum whiskey here.
It's fucking unreal.

1055
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,949
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up.

1056
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,155

1057
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,322
Oh, I'm sorry, you guys already
got fucked up, didn't you?

1058
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,705

1059
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,788
Uh, listen. I'm a little confused.
How did you...?

1060
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,500
Yeah, you know what?
I'm a little fucking confused.

1061
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:29,663
Where's Chow?!

1062
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:35,632
Where is Chow with the fucking account
code and the fucking password?!

1063
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:46,309
We don't know anything about any codes.
We're just trying to find our friend.

1064
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,106
- Teddy.
- Yes. Teddy.

1065
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,361
Have you seen him?

1066
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,692

1067
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,356
Come here.

1068
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:59,777
Hmm. Let's see. Oh.

1069
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,694
There's Teddy.

1070
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:06,659
PHIL: Holy shit. it's from last night.
STU: Hmm.

1071
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,620
Who are you?

1072
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,083
I'm a businessman...

1073
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,625
and I have invested a large chunk
of capital in your friend Chow.

1074
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,300
And in return, he was supposed
to transfer our profits electronically...

1075
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,807
about five fucking minutes ago.

1076
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:27,350
So last night,
we took Teddy as insurance.

1077
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,686
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

1078
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,397
Oh, my God. I wasn't done talking.

1079
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,487
You tell Chow...

1080
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:41,322
that we are having breakfast on the roof
of this hotel tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.

1081
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,737
Now, if he makes the transfer,
you will get Teddy.

1082
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:47,999
If not, well, then, hey, you know?
It's Bangkok.

1083
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,203
That's your cue to get the fuck
out of here.

1084
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,718

1085
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,671
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

1086
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,011
Alan, leave the hat.

1087
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,765
Attaboy.

1088
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,061

1089
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:20,778
We're fucked. Chow's dead.
What do we do now?

1090
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:25,320
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow.
This whole thing's about a bank account.

1091
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:26,909

1092
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,450
Let's just go back to the hotel,
Search Chow's body.

1093
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,369
And hopefully the password's
in his wallet or something.

1094
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,289
STU: What if it isn't?
I mean, they're gonna kill Teddy.

1095
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:40,052
Just relax. We have until 8 a.m.
tomorrow to figure it out.

1096
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,348
First the monkey, now my hat.

1097
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:48,226
How much worse can this day get?

1098
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,475

1099
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,811
Jesus Christ.

1100
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:05,619
Well, we're living here in Alantown

1101
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:11,326
And he's driven our lives into the ground

1102
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:16,208
When we woke up
We were wasted and drunk

1103
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,544
Phil got shot

1104
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:22,586
We got beaten by a monk

1105
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:28,725
I was happy, and my life was good

1106
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:34,189
Getting married like a dentist should

1107
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:38,318
Roasting marshmallows on a stick

1108
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:41,355
I got fucked in the ass

1109
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,240
By a girl with a dick

1110
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:45,491

1111
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,903
I remember that.

1112
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:54,456
And we 're living here in Alantown

1113
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,788
STU:
There's water everywhere.

1114
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,963
Yeah, that's because it melted, Stu.
The fucking power's out.

1115
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,129
"With an inadequate electrical grid
serving millions of people...

1116
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:08,219
Bangkok experiences
1500 power outages per year."

1117
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,224
PHIL:
Seriously, Alan, that's enough.

1118
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,435
Out of the way.

1119
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,352

1120
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,193
We got it.

1121
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,149

1122
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,235
ALAN:
Ghost! There's a ghost!

1123
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,571
CHOW:
Motherfucker!

1124
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,534
Chow, calm down! Chow, calm down!

1125
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:34,491
- Fucking kill on me!
- No, no, no. Ah.

1126
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,330

1127
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,079
It's okay.

1128
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:40,918
Relax.

1129
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:43,546

1130
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,006
PHIL: Shh.
CHOW: Shh.

1131
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:53,435
That's it. it's just us. Breathe.

1132
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:55,846
- Chow so cold.
PHIL: I'm gonna warm you up.

1133
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,606
Chow so cold. Chow so cold.

1134
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:01,109
You did good, buddy. You did good.

1135
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,519
Chow did good.

1136
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,697
PHIL:
Feeling better?

1137
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,070
You all right? You warm enough?

1138
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:15,161
I don't know.
Come feel my balls and tell me.

1139
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:18,953
I've been locked
in a fucking ice box all day.

1140
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:22,797
Hey, Alan, you want my awesome
sunglasses, you just ask Chow.

1141
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,629
You don't have to kill me.

1142
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:28,762
Chow, nobody killed you. You were
already dead. You didn't have a pulse.

1143
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,672
Oh, you never do blow before?

1144
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,217
Sometime your heart stop, start up again.
Read a book.

1145
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,644
Look, I'm sorry.
We're just having a bad day.

1146
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:40,148
Oh, you having a bad day? Did you die?

1147
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,141
I got shot.

1148
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,810
But did you die?

1149
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:48,027
Chow, some guy told us that
you've got a bank code or something...

1150
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:52,740
and if we don't bring it to him first thing
in the morning, he's gonna kill Teddy.

1151
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,826
Who, Kingsley? Pfft. He harmless.

1152
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:59,414
Don't worry. I got the bank codes.

1153
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,083
Great. All right,
we gotta meet him at 8 a.m.

1154
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,964
Who is that fucking guy, anyway?

1155
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,670
Invest in my business.

1156
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,547
Yeah? What business is that?

1157
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:11,884
It's called Not Your Business, okay?

1158
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,181
So where's the monkey?

1159
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:15,849
- The monkey?
- Yeah.

1160
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:20,355
I stashed the account number
and password in his vest. Where is he?

1161
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,182

1162
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:25,818
- Why would you do that?
- Safekeeping, pretty boy.

1163
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,025
I got a lot of heat on my ass.

1164
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:33,284
I got FBI, Bangkok P.D.,
Interpol, MSNBC.

1165
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,029
That monkey snorting coke
with me all night...

1166
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,744
jerking me off while
I watch Stu fuck with ladyboy.

1167
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:41,326
STU: Ugh.
- He not going anywhere.

1168
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,039
We don't have the monkey, Chow.

1169
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:46,001
No, some Russian thugs
took him from us.

1170
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:48,041
CHOW:
Oh, you fucking guys.

1171
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,965
Okay, no problem.

1172
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,175
We just have to get him back.

1173
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,224
- From where?
- Same place we took him from.

1174
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,990
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

1175
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,251

1176
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,628

1177
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:36,431
CHOW:
Think of him like monkey drug mule.

1178
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:40,389
He take coke to buyer...

1179
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,392
and deliver cash to dealer.

1180
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,187
He middleman.

1181
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,194
Dealer never handle drug directly.

1182
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,525
He clean.

1183
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,281

1184
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,907
That's terrible.

1185
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:58,286
Not terrible. What you talking about?
It's fucking genius.

1186
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:01,163
You ever see monkey go to jail?

1187
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,576
We just signal monkey for deal,
he come close...

1188
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:07,245
we take his vest and that's that.

1189
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:09,790
Maybe get some blow too.
You know, just bump.

1190
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,378
No. No more bumps, Chow.

1191
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,795
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1192
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,006

1193
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,470
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle.
Signal monkey.

1194
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,060

1195
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,656
- All right, here we go.
- Come on.

1196
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,613
How'd we wind up with the monkey
last night?

1197
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,830
Well, I needed some blow and
Alan thought he was cute, so we stole him.

1198
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,505

1199
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,047

1200
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,590
So stupid.

1201
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,100
Stu, ready to grab vest?

1202
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:05,474
I... Okay. I just grab it?

1203
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:08,264
- Yeah, just do it, Stu. Just do it.
- Hey, monkey!

1204
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,149
PHIL: Alan, shh.

1205
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:12,026

1206
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,692
- Fuck!
CHOW: We gotta go right now.

1207
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,198

1208
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:18,824
Pull that fucking monkey in!

1209
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,155
I'm trying!

1210
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,865
Aah! Fuck!

1211
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,204
CHOW:
Get that monkey in here, Stu!

1212
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,623
He won't let go!

1213
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,671
Stu, get back in the car right now!

1214
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,630
STU:
I'm trying! Slow down!

1215
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,391

1216
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,852
He's so strong!

1217
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,016
Let go, you fucking monkey!

1218
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,400

1219
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,061
- Look out!
- Aah!

1220
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,901
CHOW:
Oh, shit. Tight squeeze.

1221
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:02,361
I got him! I got him!

1222
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,449

1223
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,206
- Where's the code, Chow?
- Check his little vest.

1224
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,003
- You got it, Alan?
- Yeah, I got it, Phil.

1225
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,382
- Slow down, slow down, Chow!
- Hold on, gay boys!

1226
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,176
- Holy shit!
- Fuck.

1227
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,385

1228
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:25,266
Don't worry, I got this shit.

1229
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,307
Pig!

1230
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,023

1231
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,229
Oh, my word!

1232
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:36,269
Ha, ha. Sorry, Stu. My bad.

1233
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,283
Oh, shit.

1234
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:45,949
Get down!

1235
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,409
What the fuck?!

1236
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,698

1237
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,459
Oh, no! They shot the monkey!

1238
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:54,294
They shot the monkey!

1239
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,046
I'm at my wits' end!

1240
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,756
He's coming back around.

1241
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:02,841
Look out!

1242
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,264
- Holy fuck.
- Oh, no.

1243
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:14,232

1244
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,399

1245
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,863

1246
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,249
PHIL: Everybody all right?
ALAN: Yeah.

1247
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:35,412
Whoo! I have such an erection right now.

1248
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,334

1249
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,341
STU:
Are you for real?

1250
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,553

1251
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:46,589
ALAN:
Shh.

1252
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:50,181
It's okay. it's okay. it's okay.

1253
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,936

1254
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,767
It's okay.

1255
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,937
They're gonna take good care
of you here, okay?

1256
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:01,400
What's that?

1257
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,942
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1258
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,861
Cigarettes, got them right here.
Here you go.

1259
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,701
There you go.

1260
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,001
Deep breath.

1261
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,882
Good. Good.

1262
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,544
Smoke it in.

1263
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,213
Breathe the smoke
into your tiny little lungs.

1264
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,723
There you go.

1265
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,017
It's funny. I've never been
much of a smoker...

1266
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,223

1267
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,480
but, boy, does it look cool on you.

Use that big Jewish brain.

1429
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,143
PHIL:
He's just not up for it ...

1430
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,732
- Phil? Phil. Phil, give me the phone.
PHIL: it's Lauren.

1431
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:06,991
- I know. I need to talk to her.
- I'm handling this. I'll handle this, Stu!

1432
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:09,868
- You're gonna break her heart!
- Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

1433
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:11,074
I'm so sorry!

1434
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:14,831
Stu? What the hell is going on?
What does he mean, you lost Teddy?

1435
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,038
STU:
What? ls that what Phil said?

1436
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,829
No, no, no. We misplaced Teddy.

1437
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:23,295
But we're all good now. We're headed back
to the resort. See you soon.

1438
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,751
I love you so much.

1439
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:29,843
And I gotta go, but I'll see you soon. Bye.

1440
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:33,926
Stu!

1441
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,225
- Stu...!
ALAN: Ah!

1442
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,355
Taxi! Taxi!

1443
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:45,943
Come on! Come on, Alan! Come on!

1444
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,484
PHIL: Hey, you mind filling us in?
STU: Okay.

1445
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,903
- Now, when we woke up, the power was out.
- Yeah.

1446
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,946
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

1447
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:57,787
- In a bowl of water.
- But it didn't start out as water.

1448
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,544
- It was ice.
- Exactly. Teddy got ice from the machine...

1449
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,501
came back to the room,
put his finger on ice, fell asleep.

1450
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:07,043
What do you do if you wake up
and your finger's in a bowl of melted ice?

1451
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:10,964
I'd get more ice, Stu,
on the 15th fucking floor!

1452
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,224
Yes!
Teddy goes up, the power goes out ...

1453
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:17,512
Holy shit. Of course.

1454
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,430
Of course, he's in the ice machine.

1455
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,644
STU:
Alan, no!

1456
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:26,570
It's on 10!

1457
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:27,980
Sir, is the elevator stuck?

1458
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,398

1459
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,988
- Come on.
STU: Go. Go, go, go.

1460
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,492
Ten! This is it! Teddy!

1461
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:37,907
STU:
Teddy! Teddy!

1462
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,996
PHIL:
Look out, look out.

1463
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,083

1464
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,715

1465
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:50,844
- Oh, my God! Teddy!
- He's okay! He's okay!

1466
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:52,346
Hey, you okay?

1467
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:54,681
You okay, man?

1468
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,841
Where am I?

1469
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:58,181
You're in an elevator in the middle
of Bangkok.

1470
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,687
But we're gonna get you out of here.
It's gonna be fine.

1471
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,268
TEDDY:
Hey, Stu...

1472
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,312
nice tattoo.

1473
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:05,976

1474
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,316
STU: Thanks, man.
- All right, let's do this.

1475
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:09,946
Come on. Come on, come on.

1476
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,858
PHIL:
Doug, we found him. Yeah!

1477
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:16,700
I know, I know, but we're on our way.
Okay, bye.

1478
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:20,207
All right, guests are arriving,
people are starting to ask questions...

1479
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,367
but we can still pull this off.

1480
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,787
- How?
- I don't know. Like, a taxi?

1481
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,626
- Chow's speedboat.
- What?

1482
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,337
Last thing I remember was getting
off Chow's speedboat.

1483
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,297
Chow has a speedboat?

1484
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,428
The Perfect Life.

1485
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:35,051
Come on.

1486
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,681

1487
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:41,144
Stu, get that back line.

1488
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:44,606
ALAN:
Good jump, Phil!

1489
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,519
- You all right?
ALAN: Yeah.

1490
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,487
You sure you know how
to drive this thing?

1491
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:51,818

1492
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,278
Please. I was raised in yacht clubs.
I know what I'm doing.

1493
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,591
You know where we're going?

1494
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,101
Please address me as "captain."

1495
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,763
Oh, fuck you, Alan.

1496
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:29,568
Do you know where We're going,
captain?

1497
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:35,066
Affirmative, cadet. We're going south,
through the Gulf of Thailand. Ha, ha.

1498
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,404
Good.

1499
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,971
Hey. You okay?

1500
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,136
- Feeling a little better.
- All right.

1501
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:10,108
Listen, Teddy, I'm really sorry.
We didn't mean for any of this to happen.

1502
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:15,023
It's funny. I can't remember anything...

1503
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:18,317
but when I woke up...

1504
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,407
I was kind of happy.

1505
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:22,450
Yeah!

1506
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:27,660
By the way, you have any idea
where my finger is?

1507
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:31,171
Yeah, we gave it
to a drug-dealing monkey.

1508
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,543
Bangkok.

1509
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,844
Yeah, right?

1510
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:39,801
Fucking Bangkok.

1511
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,061

1512
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:50,019
He's on his way, I'm telling you.
Dad's always doing this.

1513
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,021
No, it's just ...

1514
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,562
I apologize! There will be no wedding!

1515
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:58,152
No, he is on his way. He will be here.

1516
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,943
Please, if you will all move to the bar.

1517
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,362
We are going to clear this area. Please.

1518
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:04,700

1519
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:06,661
LAUREN:
Daddy, how can you do this?

1520
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:09,785
I'm telling you, I spoke to him.
He's coming.

1521
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,669

1522
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:13,546
LAUREN:
You don't understand.

1523
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:16,174
Look. There they are.

1524
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:19,628

1525
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,801
Stu!

1526
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,394

1527
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,179
Alan, there's no dock.

1528
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:30,393
ALAN:
Just hang on.

1529
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,808
- Alan, it's not funny. Turn the boat.
- Hang on.

1530
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,647
Is that Alan driving the boat?

1531
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,403
DOUG:
What? Uh ...

1532
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:39,815
We should probably move back a little bit.
Come on.

1533
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,358
PHIL: Alan, slow down!
STU: Please!

1534
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,324
Turn the boat! Turn the boat, Alan!
Turn the fucking boat!

1535
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,159
Everyone, back up a little bit here.

1536
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,666
Sir, it's gonna get worse
before it gets better. Come on, sir.

1537
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:50,917
PHIL:
Hold on! Hold on!

1538
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,085

1539
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:58,046

1540
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:01,753
PHIL:
Fuck!

1541
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,263

1542
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:06,512
Hi.

1543
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,518
Hi, everybody.

1544
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,264
We came in a little hotter
than we planned.

1545
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,607
And sorry we trenched the lawn here.

1546
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:17,611
Totally fixable. A bit of sod, we'll be fine.

1547
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,112
- Baby!
- Oh, my God.

1548
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:22,366
- Hi.
- Ah, I'm so happy to see you.

1549
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:24,777
FOHN:
Teddy.

1550
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:26,699
Teddy, here.

1551
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,956
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, Teddy.

1552
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:32,209
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1553
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,869
No! Your hand!

1554
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,961
I know. We had an accident. I'm okay.

1555
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,589
- This is your fault.
- No, Dad.

1556
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,628
He's right. Mr. Srisai, Lauren.

1557
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:46,048
- I haven't been completely honest with you.
- Stu?

1558
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:47,261
- Yeah?
- Don't do this.

1559
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:49,722
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

1560
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,558
You said I'm chok.

1561
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:55,099
Well, I'm not.

1562
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:59,987
I'm not some weird milky, ricey,
watery goop...

1563
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:02,773
that you feed to infants
and old people, okay?

1564
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:06,409
Maybe I would be
if you added some cayenne pepper.

1565
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:07,990

1566
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:13,371
I wish I was a boring dentist
who had a boring life and boring friends...

1567
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:16,002
but I don't, I'm not.

1568
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,622
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

1569
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:22,258
Hey, it's not weird. it's pretty cool, actually.
No membership fee...

1570
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:24,670
I have heard enough of this.
You come here.

1571
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,383
Whoa.

1572
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,015
Here's the deal, man.

1573
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,097
I got a dark side.

1574
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,973
There's a demon in me.

1575
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:38,020
It's true, he has semen in him.

1576
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:40,982
I said "demon."

1577
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,021
But you also have semen in you.
Remember?

1578
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,941
That's not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

1579
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:48,656
Point is...

1580
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:53,369
this demon takes me
to some pretty weird places.

1581
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:56,785
And we lost Teddy
for two days in Bangkok.

1582
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:01,215
But that same demon took us to hell
and back to find him.

1583
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,876
We took on Bangkok and we won.

1584
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:08,388
And that's pretty fucking cool
if you ask me. Right?

1585
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,430
I love your daughter

unless you have any problem with that.

But all that said...

1589
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:25,777
it would actually mean a great deal
to both of us...

ALAN:
Thanks, Phil.

1595
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:54,434
You should shave your head too.

1596
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:56,140
Why would I do that?

1597
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:58,930
Well, that way,
we would look exactly alike.

lasered as soon as we're home in L.A.
