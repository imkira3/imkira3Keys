2
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,780
- It has been confirmed

3
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,800
that it was an apparent homicide.

4
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,340
Sources also say the
residence was burglarized

5
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,090
with most notable items
stolen being a clown costume

6
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,220
and makeup kit.

7
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,160
A neighbor is quoted as
saying the victim worked

8
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,120
as a clown at children's parties.

9
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,200
And finally, there is no
information at this time

10
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,130
as to whether there is
any connection between

11
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,210
this case and the escape
last week of a patient

12
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,340
at Orchid Wood Psychiatric Ward.

13
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,196
We now return you to your
regularly scheduled programing.

14
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,293
- I've lived in Barnum all my life.

15
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,593
It's been my whole world, you might say.

16
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,890
Barnum can be a really nice place

17
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,973
but it also has a darker side.

18
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,333
Some strange things have
happened here over the years.

19
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,640
One such tale involves a
rather sinister character

20
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,640
masquerading as that most adored
of children's entertainers.

21
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,803
A circus clown.

22
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,820
Historically, clowns
have been a great source

23
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,480
of fun and amusement.

24
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,490
These zany court jesters have entertained

25
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,923
both royalty and commoners alike.

26
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,693
But clowns can have a dark side too.

27
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,963
In fact, some clowns
can be downright deadly.

28
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,660
Such is the case in a
sinister little story

29
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,413
called "Die Laughing."

30
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,013
- Hello.

31
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,603
Oh hi, babe, I was just
looking at your picture.

32
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,110
No, I don't know if I got the job.

33
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,630
Yeah, the interview went pretty well

34
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,280
but they didn't make me an offer.

35
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,440
They just said they'd get back to me.

36
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,533
It's all so frustrating, lately.

37
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,380
Don't worry about me,
though, I'll be all right.

38
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,773
Things have to turn around
eventually, don't they?

39
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,700
Miss Rusa is just a mean old
bat is all it comes down to.

40
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,793
So how did your trip go?

41
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,563
Are you going to be getting home today?

42
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,383
I can't wait to see you.

43
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,738
Well come by if it's not too late.

44
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,003
Okay.

45
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,903
Love you.

46
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,693
Bye.

47
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,130
Miss Rusa, what a pleasant surprise.

48
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,820
- You can skip the niceties, sweetie.

49
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,920
Do you have the rent for me yet?

50
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,972
- No, not yet but I'll
have it for you real soon.

51
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:15,960
I just need a little more time.

52
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm between jobs right now.

53
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,340
- You know, there are other people

54
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,810
I could rent this place to.

55
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,770
This is a good location and
I got people interested.

56
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,920
I want my money,

57
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,470
otherwise you better start
looking for a new place.

58
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,840
Understood?

59
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,673
- Understood.

60
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,770
- I better be hearing
from you soon, missy.

61
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,603
- You will.

62
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,480
- I want these yards cleaned up good!

63
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,600
They're both a mess, understand?

64
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,792
- You got it, Miss Rusa.

65
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:52,625
- Good.

66
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,020
For what I'm paying you
fellas, you better have it!

67
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,830
It's highway robbery, if you ask me.

68
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,740
- Don't worry, Miss Rusa,
you'll get your money's worth.

69
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,663
- I better.

70
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,360
- What a grouch.

71
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,550
- You said it, Bill.

72
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,630
Well, I guess we better get to work.

73
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,463
- Yup.

74
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,233
- Hey, you!

75
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,145
What're you doing back there?

76
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:27,768
You def?

77
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:29,950
I said, what're you doing back there?

78
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:40,367
Hey, get out of there!

79
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,923
- Hello?

80
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,120
Hello, anyone home?

81
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,470
- Yes.

82
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,377
- Just letting you know,

83
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:55,577
we're gonna be out here
working on the yard.

84
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,013
- Joe?

85
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,493
Hey, Joe, you still out here?

86
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,110
You better not have knocked off early.

87
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,623
Miss Rusa will chew us out
if it's not finished today.

88
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,053
And we need this job.

89
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,193
Joe!

90
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:48,738
- Johnny!

91
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:53,336
- Run!

92
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:07,049
- Miss Rusa!

93
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:07,882
Miss Rusa!

94
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:24,216
- No!

95
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,070
- Hey, Lisa, it's Shawn.

96
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,210
I have bad news.

97
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,373
I'm stuck on the side of the road.

98
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,950
My car broke down.

99
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,753
I believe I'm on Route Two.

100
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,950
Could you do me a favor, though?

101
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,810
Could you call the
Williamsons and tell them

102
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,330
I'll just be a little bit late?

103
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm waiting for the tow truck.

104
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,550
But make sure to tell them
that Buzbo will be there.

105
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,383
All right.

106
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,203
Okay.

107
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,550
All right, thank you.

108
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:33,328
- Oh!

109
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,493
- Let me guess,
wild turkey on the rocks?

110
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,860
- Well, no, I'll just
have a Shirley Temple.

111
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,357
- You know what
they say, if you don't drink--

112
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,660
- People love movies.

113
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,190
They provides a voyeuristic escape

114
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,853
that just can't be found elsewhere.

115
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,913
People love their movie stars too.

116
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,173
Especially those from the past.

117
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,630
But it can all become too easy

118
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,170
to get wrapped up in cinematic fantasies.

119
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,830
That's the case in a twisted little tale

120
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,493
called "The Horror Hostess."

121
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,453
- Hello.

122
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,543
Oh hey!

123
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,370
Yeah, I'm getting ready now.

124
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,650
I'll see you in about an hour.

125
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,560
Okay, thanks, bye.

126
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:59,750
- Just a few more spots.

127
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,903
- Sure thing, hun.

128
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,870
- I can't tell you how much

129
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,440
I appreciate this opportunity, Jeana.

130
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,900
It means so much to me.

131
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,155
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

132
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:13,053
I only wish I could pay you a
proper makeup artist salary.

133
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,240
You do good work, Katie.

134
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,400
- Thanks.

135
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,870
I really mean it.

136
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,920
Just to get a foot in the door.

137
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,620
I love the horror genre.

138
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,876
- Well that makes two of us.

139
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,123
- So cool, even just to
be a small part of it.

140
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:33,230
There you go, all done.

141
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,063
- Great.

142
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,860
- Oh, I gotta get to class.

143
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,650
I gotta be there in 20 minutes.

144
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,120
Good luck with the show today

145
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,320
and I hope you have a
really exciting interview.

146
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,520
- Oh, thank you so much.

147
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:46,483
- And there you have it.

148
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,610
That was a scene from "Technopath,"

149
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,990
the new stalker movie
starring tonight's guest

150
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,210
at the Horror Pad,

151
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,620
scream queen extraordinaire,

152
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,393
Rebecca Blaze!

153
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,020
So how are you doing tonight, Rebecca?

154
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,853
- Excellent.

155
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:03,400
Thanks for having me on the show, Jeana.

156
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,390
- Oh, that clip was so exciting.

157
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,100
Tell us a little more about "Technopath."

158
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,480
- Oh, it's a cool little slasher movie

159
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,853
about a psychotic maniac
stalking young coeds.

160
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:18,760
Great special effects, great cast.

161
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,900
The fans are going to love it.

162
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,450
- Well you certainly have become

163
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,820
a real fan favorite in the genre.

164
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,570
Horror has been good to you, hasn't it?

165
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,453
- Oh yes, it has.

166
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,380
The fans are amazing.

167
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,100
I don't know where I
would be without them.

168
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,073
I do it all for the fans.

169
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,190
- Well, right now, we have another treat

170
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,410
for all you fright fans out there,

171
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,070
a clip from the indie horror
flick, "Blood Carousel,"

172
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,840
starring my extra special
guest, Rebecca Blaze!

173
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,993
Enjoy!

174
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,693
- And we're out.

175
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,480
- Thanks again for doing the show.

176
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,640
- Of course.

177
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,940
- We have just a couple more
questions after the clip

178
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,060
and that will be it.

179
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,930
- Cool.

180
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,763
- Although,

181
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,080
if you could hang around
for awhile after the taping,

182
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,450
I'd love to pick your brain some more.

183
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,750
- Sure, why not?

184
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,583
- Oh, great.

185
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,692
Care for a refill, hun?

186
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:31,525
- Sure.

187
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,918
- To the horror genre.

188
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,053
I love classic horror
from back in the day.

189
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,803
Those fright film stars were great.

190
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,483
Such elegant men and women.

191
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:09,440
They exuded and amazing onscreen radiance

192
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,150
which gave the genre
that intangible quality

193
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,573
that can't be found anywhere else.

194
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,610
Of course, today's cinema is great too.

195
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,693
I mean, I can't wait to see
"Technopath" in its entirety.

196
00:28:25,174 --> 00:28:27,818
- Well between you and me,

197
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:30,503
it's actually pretty stupid.

198
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:38,047
I just run around and
scream and show some skin.

199
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,351
It's just your standard T and A flick.

200
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:45,853
But it should be enough
to impress the simpletons.

201
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,353
- Simpletons?

202
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,990
- Yeah, you know.

203
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,363
My fans.

204
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,281
- But you said you owed it all to them.

205
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,223
- I do.

206
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,080
They're the ones that
keep buying the crap.

207
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,010
- Care for another drink, hun?

208
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,524
- Hey.

209
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,350
I was drinking that.

210
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,133
- I think you've had
quite enough, young lady.

211
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,190
You know, if there's
one thing I can't stand,

212
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,130
it's a phony.

213
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,400
- What?

214
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,660
- A phony.

215
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,110
Someone who pretends to be one thing,

216
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,690
but in reality is the exact opposite.

217
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,510
- Who are you calling a phony?

218
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,480
- Why you, dear.

219
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,270
You have absolutely no
respect for the horror genre

220
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,730
or its fans.

221
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,173
You should be ashamed of yourself.

222
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,760
- Listen, bitch,

223
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,353
I worked my ass off to get where I am.

224
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,670
I don't have to take any crap from any

225
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,960
low rent Elvira wannabe.

226
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,360
- Now, now, dear, temper, temper.

227
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,160
And no name-calling, young lady.

228
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,211
- That's it.

229
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,730
I'm out of here.

230
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,940
- Oh, no, no, no, dear.

231
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,820
I can't let you leave.

232
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,550
Not now.

233
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,250
- What did you say?

234
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,820
- I said, I can't let you leave now.

235
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,033
- Screw you, bitch!

236
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,587
What?

237
00:30:40,587 --> 00:30:41,747
- Well, hello gain.

238
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:44,510
You know, I really love the horror genre

239
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,733
far too much to let you go.

240
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:49,580
- What're you talking about?

241
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,810
- Oh, you really wouldn't
understand, you silly little tart.

242
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,860
It really is the purest art form,

243
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,860
exploring the depths of fear,
terror and the human soul.

244
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,053
- You're crazy.

245
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,863
Bitch, you spiked my drink.

246
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,360
- Now why would I do that?

247
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:39,506
Now that's a real horror scream.

248
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,589
Definitely your best yet.

249
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:42,570
- There you go, as gorgeous as always.

250
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,023
- Oh, thank you, Katie.

251
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,240
- I gotta cruise.

252
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,740
- Oh, late for another class?

253
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,263
- I will be if I don't hurry.

254
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:55,080
Hey, how'd that interview
go with that actress?

255
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,570
Rebecca Blaze.

256
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,620
- Actually, she was quite a letdown.

257
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,510
That woman just didn't have the passion

258
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,760
that she should've had.

259
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,750
- That sucks.

260
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,210
- Yeah, it does.

261
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,110
But on the bright side,

262
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,680
I came up with a whole new show intro.

263
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,350
It's a real scream.

264
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,310
- Cool.

265
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,730
Can't wait to see it.

266
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,499
I'll see you later.

267
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,683
- Nature has a way of being evil.

268
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,570
Take the Venus flytrap for example,

269
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,823
where it devours its prey.

270
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,810
Man hasn't been kind to nature, though,

271
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,600
with chemicals and what have you.

272
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,600
This time, nature strikes
back in a nasty way

273
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,307
in a story called, "The Bad Flower."

274
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,303
- There, that should do it.

275
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,650
Oh no.

276
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,683
What have I done?

277
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,690
I can't believe I mixed
Venus flytrap seeds

278
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,740
with sunflower seeds.

279
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,983
Oh well, it won't harm anything.

280
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:38,296
- Damn big ugly things.

281
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,690
Why anyone would want to
plant such a freaky thing

282
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,603
is beyond me.

283
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,684
Maybe they'd like a little
taste of my weed killer.

284
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,173
- What do you think you're doing?!

285
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:56,762
You're killing my plants!

286
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:57,876
Stop it!

287
00:35:57,876 --> 00:35:58,709
Stop it!

288
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:00,420
- Get your hands off of me!

289
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,080
Those plants are blocking
the sunlight to my plants,

290
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,040
so they deserve to die!

291
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,960
Why do you grow such ugly things anyway?

292
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,520
- Those are my plants!

293
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,280
You can't do this!

294
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,090
- As far as I'm concerned,
they are on my property

295
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,980
blocking the sun to my plants,

296
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,186
so back off!

297
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:18,436
- I said, stop!

298
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:22,689
- I warned you.

299
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,201
- How could you?

300
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:28,368
How could you?

301
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:34,042
- Maybe next time you'll
learn not to mess with me.

302
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:36,942
And get rid of those
damn things before I do.

303
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:45,120
- I'm so sorry she hurt you.

304
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,733
I tried to stop her.

305
00:36:48,528 --> 00:36:49,361
She's so mean.

306
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:53,243
I hope she gets what she deserves.

307
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:47,700
Oh no.

308
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,210
My big sunflower's gone.

309
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,633
What happened to it?

310
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,730
Thorn.

311
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,010
I should've guessed.

312
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,640
This time she's gone too far.

313
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,583
It's time I paid her a visit.

314
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:14,273
- Carolyn?

315
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:15,106
Carolyn?

316
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,292
Maybe she's in the garden.

317
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,125
Carolyn?

318
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:24,452
Hey, Carolyn.

319
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,060
- Yes, I'm working on the
account right now, sir.

320
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,300
I'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

321
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,830
What's that?

322
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,610
Oh yes, the changes have been made.

323
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,333
Just the way you ask for them.

324
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,633
Okay, sir, take care.

325
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,613
Jerk.

326
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,653
Hello?

327
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,323
Hmm.

328
00:42:51,457 --> 00:42:53,046
Nah.

329
00:42:53,046 --> 00:42:55,379
I think it's time for a nap.

330
00:43:43,502 --> 00:43:44,658
Plants!

331
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:45,491
Plants!

332
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:48,841
Help me!

333
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:52,076
I can't breathe.

334
00:43:56,248 --> 00:43:57,876
Choking!

335
00:44:25,637 --> 00:44:27,720
- What the hell was that?

336
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,877
A walking plant?

337
00:44:44,931 --> 00:44:46,633
Who's gonna believe me?

338
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,563
No more stopping at the bar after work.

339
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:26,004
No!

340
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:26,837
No!

341
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:30,827
No.

342
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,290
No!

343
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,920
- Can't believe there have now been

344
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,680
four murders in this town.

345
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,470
- And to think, the
first one was right here

346
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,100
in my own backyard.

347
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,840
It scares me.

348
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,870
- I know but you know as well as I do

349
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,230
that Mrs. Thorn deserved it.

350
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,480
- Oh Cindy, even Mrs. Thorn

351
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,910
doesn't deserve to die like that.

352
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:13,540
- After what that which did
to you, you're just too nice.

353
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,490
- But those terrible murders.

354
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,120
That poor guy playing basketball.

355
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,930
I hope they catch the killer soon.

356
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,660
I'm afraid to even come out here

357
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,630
and sit in my own garden for very long.

358
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,800
- Speaking of your garden,

359
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,440
did you ever find that plant
that Mrs. Thorn ripped out?

360
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,588
- Oh, you mean my nice, big sunflower?

361
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,530
No, I never saw it again.

362
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,980
- I remember when you
first started growing that.

363
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:37,950
- What is it?

364
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,086
Cindy, what's the matter?

365
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:41,740
- That sunflower,

366
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,420
I thought you said it was gone.

367
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,330
- It is gone, Cindy.

368
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,820
- Turn around.

369
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,640
- Cindy, stop playing games.

370
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,603
- Turn around.

371
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,656
- I don't believe it.

372
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,483
I just don't believe it.

373
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,623
It's been gone.

374
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,970
Now it looks like it
was never even dug up.

375
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,320
- Maybe someone's trying
to play a joke on you.

376
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,080
- But the only one who
would do something like that

377
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,003
is Mrs. Thorn and she's dead.

378
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,283
- I don't understand it.

379
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,770
- I have to go in for a
minute, do you want anything?

380
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,480
- No thanks, I'm fine.

381
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,180
- Okay, I'll be right back.

382
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:40,536
- Carolyn!

383
00:48:40,536 --> 00:48:41,665
Help!

384
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:42,498
Carolyn!

385
00:48:45,663 --> 00:48:46,496
- Cindy?

386
00:48:47,572 --> 00:48:48,905
- Carolyn, help!

387
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:51,431
Help!

388
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:52,264
Carolyn!

389
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:55,337
Carolyn, help!

390
00:48:55,337 --> 00:48:56,650
- Stop!

391
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,637
Stop, you're killing her!

392
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:10,490
Cindy, are you okay?

393
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,371
Are you all right?

394
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:13,196
- I'll be okay.

395
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:14,862
- Oh no!

396
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:18,880
Your lighter!

397
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,300
Cindy, where's your lighter?

398
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,283
- It's in my purse, on the table!

399
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,600
- You want someone, take me!

400
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,150
I'm right her, come and get me!

401
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,983
Take me!

402
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:21,710
- Our final story

403
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,533
brings us a series of brutal murders.

404
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,910
A lethal hunter ravaging a small town

405
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,430
and a group of people

406
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,550
headed for a blood-drenched encounter,

407
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,010
all in a strange little tale

408
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,907
called, "The Hunt."

409
00:50:54,372 --> 00:50:55,618
- Somebody!

410
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,151
- Elizabeth!

411
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:48,263
- Okay.

412
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,650
So now, Mr. Linden,

413
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,193
you claim not to have
seen anything at all.

414
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,160
- That's what I said.

415
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,820
- And you're not sure that
you heard anything either.

416
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,373
- Nope, not sure.

417
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,863
- Mr. Linden, can I be frank with you?

418
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,080
Several other people,

419
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,690
farther away from where
the murders took place,

420
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,520
are positive they heard a
woman screaming for help

421
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,530
and if that's the case,

422
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:17,960
then it's hard to believe that a woman

423
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,584
screaming right outside your doorstep

424
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:21,493
didn't get your attention.

425
00:52:21,493 --> 00:52:24,317
- I told you, I ain't sure what I heard.

426
00:52:24,317 --> 00:52:27,595
Coulda been coyotes for all I knew.

427
00:52:27,595 --> 00:52:28,845
- Coyotes, huh?

428
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,970
There have been several
very brutal murders,

429
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:36,080
all in close proximity to your place.

430
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,290
- The police already questioned me.

431
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,789
They was here all day yesterday.

432
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:42,837
- Well now I'm questioning you.

433
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,193
- I can't tell you nothing else.

434
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,630
- Okay.

435
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,080
Then I guess we're done here.

436
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,090
Something I can help you with?

437
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,077
Can I help you with something?

438
00:53:43,523 --> 00:53:45,223
- Dang kids.

439
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,473
Always messing up property.

440
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,817
- The unholy beast must be laid to rest!

441
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,010
- Get them out of here.

442
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,220
- Okay, folks, show's over.

443
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,410
Let's move it back, please.

444
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,350
- Jimmy Rogers, Beacon Post.

445
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,370
Is there any hard
evidence in the case yet?

446
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,140
- I have no statement
to make at this time.

447
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,270
- Why has this investigation
been taken over by the FBI?

448
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,210
And what about all the
reports about conflicts

449
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,680
with local law enforcement?

450
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,280
- I said I have no statement.

451
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,580
- And what about all the
talk about a monster?

452
00:55:20,713 --> 00:55:22,880
About a monster roaming the town?

453
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,360
How much longer do the people have to wait

454
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,193
before they get some answers?!

455
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:03,867
- You, get out of here!

456
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:05,450
- Screw you, Cyrus!

457
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,500
- So I take it there is
something I could help you with.

458
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,333
- Maybe.

459
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,670
- I must say, you got
here pretty fast on foot.

460
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,600
- I'm familiar with the area.

461
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,250
I grew up around here.

462
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,640
- So what can I do for you, Mister?

463
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,740
- Johnson.

464
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,763
Darren Johnson.

465
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,460
- What can I do for you, Mr. Johnson?

466
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,600
- You're the FBI agent

467
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,030
investigating the murders
in town, aren't you?

468
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,203
- That's right.

469
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:07,036
Leanna.

470
00:57:07,036 --> 00:57:07,869
Leanna Stark.

471
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,090
What can I do for you?

472
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:13,800
- Do you have any leads
to the killer's identity

473
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,343
or where they might be?

474
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,510
- That's confidential, Mr. Johnson.

475
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,860
My investigation's ongoing.

476
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,653
Do you have any information for me?

477
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:25,770
- No.

478
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,670
It's just I don't think
it's a normal killer

479
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,870
that we're dealing with.

480
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,623
- What exactly does that mean?

481
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,660
- Well, it may not be something
that you're expecting.

482
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,720
- Mr. Johnson, do you
watch the local news a lot?

483
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,920
- Yeah, as much as the
next person, I guess.

484
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,927
- My guess is a little
more than the next person.

485
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:51,853
"It" may not be "something" I'm expecting?

486
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,590
Your local reporters and
the townsfolk around here

487
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,890
have some wild imagination

488
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:00,870
and if you're here to feed
me more of that vampire crap,

489
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,320
you can save it.

490
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,320
- You might be better off keeping
an open mind about things.

491
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,710
- I might be better off
getting a good night sleep

492
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,900
before I file a long and
tedious report with the bureau

493
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,320
and then I'll be better off finding out

494
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,350
who is committing these sick murders.

495
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,670
And then I might be better off

496
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,713
getting out of this dead end town!

497
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,540
Now I'm gonna ask you again,

498
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,589
do you have anything to share?

499
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:23,510
- No.

500
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:24,483
Nothing to share.

501
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,353
- Stupid hicks.

502
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,983
- Hey, who's there?

503
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,143
I said, who's there?

504
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,430
- Don't play games
with me, I'm warning you!

505
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:17,620
You better tell me, or else!

506
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,780
- You're crazy!

507
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,613
Get out of here!

508
00:59:19,613 --> 00:59:22,290
- You better start talking
or you'll be sorry!

509
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:24,790
You know where she is and
you're going to tell me!

510
00:59:25,992 --> 00:59:28,280
- I don't know what you're talking about.

511
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,163
- You lie!

512
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,930
- Get out of here before
I call the police.

513
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,440
- You're hiding that woman.

514
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,640
That thing.

515
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,940
- I said get out of here.

516
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,800
- I know how to deal with it.

517
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,650
- She'd kill you.

518
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,603
She'd kill us both.

519
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,840
- What's the problem here, gentlemen?

520
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,973
Mr. Johnson, drop the piece of wood.

521
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,120
Now I'm gonna wanna word with you.

522
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,650
Mr. Linden, stay where you are

523
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,950
because I'm gonna wanna
word with you as well.

524
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,733
Have a seat.

525
01:00:03,826 --> 01:00:06,290
Did you knock Mr. Linden to the ground?

526
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,220
- I might have.

527
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,510
We were having a discussion.

528
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:10,980
- A discussion?

529
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,030
Looked more like a heated argument to me.

530
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,970
If I catch you assaulting Mr. Linden,

531
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,960
or anyone else for that matter,

532
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,150
I will cuff you on the spot.

533
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:23,830
Is that clear?

534
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:24,663
- Yes.

535
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,950
- Good.

536
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,337
Now what's with the wooden stake?

537
01:00:28,337 --> 01:00:30,920
- You must know the answer to that by now.

538
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,140
- Oh yes, I forgot.

539
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,880
You think the killer's a vampire

540
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,400
and let me guess,

541
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,410
you're here to kill it
with a wooden stake.

542
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,920
- I don't care if you believe me or not.

543
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,560
I know the truth.

544
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,010
- I seriously suggest

545
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,910
that you don't go waving
those things around at people.

546
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,683
It might be bad for your health.

547
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,003
Now, Mr. Linden,

548
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:55,070
have you got something to share with me?

549
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,330
- It's Camille.

550
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,293
She's the one.

551
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,060
- Camille?

552
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,720
The one who's committing all these murders

553
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,060
is a woman named Camille?

554
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,523
- No, not a woman.

555
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,020
- You too?

556
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,770
You're gonna feed me this crap too?

557
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,713
- It ain't crap.

558
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,110
- All right, Mr. Linden,

559
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,460
why don't you enlighten me?

560
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:26,240
- One morning, close to sunrise,

561
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,383
I heard a rapping at my back door.

562
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,034
There she was.

563
01:01:34,034 --> 01:01:38,077
This woman with a blanket thrown over her.

564
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:40,583
Her face just peeking out from under it.

565
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:45,620
She looked nervous.

566
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,910
Like someone was after her.

567
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,380
Kept looking up at the sky

568
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,967
as if something was
gonna fall down on her.

569
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:56,500
She said she needed help.

570
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,290
I asked her what's wrong

571
01:01:58,290 --> 01:01:59,700
but she wouldn't say.

572
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,410
So I said, "Come in."

573
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:06,210
But she hesitated and asked
me if she was invited.

574
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:08,076
I didn't think nothing of it.

575
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:11,503
Just said, yes, she's
invited and brought her in.

576
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:18,390
She said she was traveling
by foot around the country

577
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:21,973
and needed a place to stay for a few days.

578
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,393
Anyway,

579
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:29,020
nothing happened that day.

580
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,440
She stayed in the spare room

581
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,803
with the shades drawn and the door locked.

582
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,583
I thought she was just tired.

583
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,202
The next night, I heard a scream
not too far from the house.

584
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:48,190
And I went outside

585
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:50,247
and through the graveyard.

586
01:03:04,987 --> 01:03:07,500
And that's when I saw her,

587
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,171
feeding on that first hiker.

588
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:16,760
There was blood everywhere.

589
01:03:27,043 --> 01:03:30,290
And that's when she saw me watching.

590
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:33,910
She said she'd do the same
to me if I said anything.

591
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,270
I said nothing to nobody.

592
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,983
Since then, she's been hiding
out in my old tool shed.

593
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,720
I guess she likes it better there.

594
01:03:45,085 --> 01:03:47,380
I kept hoping she'd leave,

595
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,993
go to some other town.

596
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,840
- He should he help responsible!

597
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,480
- Why don't you take me out

598
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,421
to this shed of yours, Mr. Linden?

599
01:03:59,421 --> 01:04:00,650
- No.

600
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,150
- I'll make him take us out there!

601
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,238
- Stay out of this!

602
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:04,283
- I can't!

603
01:04:04,283 --> 01:04:05,525
She'll kill me!

604
01:04:05,525 --> 01:04:06,358
She'll kill me!

605
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:07,950
- Don't even think about following me!

606
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,670
- Get out of here!

607
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,013
Leave it alone!

608
01:04:32,013 --> 01:04:34,452
- Drop the gun, Mr. Liden, now!

609
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,126
- Hello?

610
01:07:35,632 --> 01:07:36,632
- Elizabeth!

611
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:52,308
Elizabeth, no!

612
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,050
Elizabeth!

613
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,340
Elizabeth!

614
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,590
Come on, come on!

615
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:00,643
Elizabeth, come on.

616
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:03,268
Somebody.

617
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:33,848
- Drop the wood.

618
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:35,715
- She killed my wife!

619
01:09:06,233 --> 01:09:07,816
- Well look at you.

620
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:12,070
And I thought vampires were nonsense.

621
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:13,393
Just a bunch of crap.

622
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,593
Here you are.

623
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,323
In the flesh.

624
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:22,230
You've certainly done a number
on these people, haven't you?

625
01:09:23,313 --> 01:09:25,840
And now you're gonna do something for me.

626
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,253
You're gonna help me out.

627
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:32,703
Wrong answer, bitch!

628
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:36,160
See, I've got lots of ammo

629
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,650
and though I may not be able to kill you,

630
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:41,833
I can torture you all night long.

631
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:45,543
Are you ready to listen
to what I have to say?

632
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,593
I'll take your silence as a yes.

633
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,380
I want out of this rat race.

634
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,733
People think my life is exciting,

635
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,223
like on TV.

636
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,163
Think again, sister.

637
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,163
My life is going through the motions.

638
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:11,510
Long hours,

639
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,580
no recognition,

640
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,710
lonely nights,

641
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:18,240
ex-husbands that don't
wanna pay child support

642
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,503
when they're supposed to.

643
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,163
That's my life.

644
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,480
But not anymore because here you are

645
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:30,499
and you're gonna get rid of that for me.

646
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:33,540
You're gonna take away the pain

647
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:36,280
and I'm gonna have total freedom,

648
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,681
just like

649
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:38,514
you!

650
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:42,243
Now,

651
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,340
are you gonna play ball

652
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:50,103
or do I have to fire off another shot?

653
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,163
Easy now.

654
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,150
I hope you've got a good bedside manner

655
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:02,343
because if I feel more
than a few pin pricks,

656
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,120
I'm gonna start blasting away.

657
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:37,853
- So you see,

658
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,243
that one was my story.

659
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,050
Like I said,

660
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,933
some strange things have
happened here over the years.
