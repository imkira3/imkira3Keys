00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,780
Happy birthday,
dear Janice

3
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,450
Happy birthday to you!

4
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,580
lt's my
anorexic boss' birthday.

5
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,250
This means there's
a certain amount
of inter-office pressure

6
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,460
to stand around
the conference table

7
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,920
eating crappy food
and pretending
to worship her.

8
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,960
That's so good.

9
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,390
Acting for five minutes
like Janice doesn't make
all our lives miserable

10
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,180
is the hardest work
l'll do all day.

11
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,860
My job title
is account manager.

12
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,980
l used to be called
an account service
representative,

13
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,450
but a consultant told us
we needed to manage
our clients

14
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,450
and not service them.

15
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,460
l have a girlfriend whom
l neither manage nor service.

16
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,210
That's my best friend, Barry,
fucking her on an lKEA
kitchen table

17
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,920
l picked up
for a really good price.

18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,390
l'm finding it
hard to care about
anything these days.

19
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,720
ln fact, the only thing l do
care about is the fact that
l can't care about anything.

20
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,520
Seriously. lt worries me.

21
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,230
My name is Wesley Gibson.

22
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,200
My dad walked out on my mom
when l was seven days old.

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,080
Sometimes l wonder if he ever
looked into my baby blues eyes
and asked himself,

24
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,920
"Did l just father
the most insignificant asshole
of the 21st century?"

25
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,730
Well, if you could get me
the consignment to me
by the 28th... Yeah.

26
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,270
Do you have the numbers
in front of you?

27
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,530
Relax.

28
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,750
If your name had come up,
you'd be dead already.

29
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,460
We've had some
unexpected losses recently.

30
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,880
We'd like to know

31
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,970
where our competitor
is getting his munition.

32
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,440
It's clean.

33
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,150
Meaning?

34
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,650
Meaning it's untraceable.

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,730
Your competitor's very smart.

36
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,320
Get down!

37
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,840
Fuck it.

38
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,010
No one leaves
the Fraternity, Cross.

39
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,510
l have a new perspective
on the Fraternity.

40
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,060
Careful.

41
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,100
You don't destroy something
that's been around
for a thousand years.

42
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,150
lt's already destroyed.
He broke the code.

43
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,360
l have to stop this.

44
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Really?
You know this.

45
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,070
So why don't you
face me yourself?

46
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,290
Never send sheep
to kill a wolf.

47
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,960
They were just
the decoys.

48
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,290
Goodbye, Mr. X.

49
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,410
Never send sheep
to kill a wolf.

50
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,660
They were just
the decoys.

51
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,330
Wesley!

52
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,540
What is it?

53
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,340
What do you mean,
"What is it"? Listen.

54
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,890
Well, how am I
suppose to sleep with
all that fucking racket?

55
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,390
When are we gonna move
so we don't have to
wake up to that shit?

56
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,180
I kind of like it.

57
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,110
lt helps to drown out
the sound of your annoying,
fucking voice.

58
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,320
Now, please, let me sleep.

59
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,860
Have you even thought
about our talk?

60
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,030
Yes.

61
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,780
Which one?

62
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,330
Perfect. That's perfect.

63
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,740
Feed Annabelle.

64
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,250
Sorry.

65
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,590
Oh, my fucking God.

66
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,470
I hope that's not
my billing report
sitting on your desk.

67
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,010
Holy shit on an altar, it is.

68
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,810
I want that report
on my desk in one hour.

69
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,440
Okay, everybody,
we're all gonna stay
an extra hour...

70
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Want to hear
something sad?

71
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,280
l need an ergonomic keyboard
to keep my repetitive stress
injury in check.

72
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,240
Just the fact that l repeat
something enough

73
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,860
that it causes me
stress is fucking sad.

74
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,280
Nice job, dude.
You seen Barry?

75
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,160
He had to go
to the dentist.
Again.

76
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,120
Yes!

77
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,630
Barry!

78
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,090
You think they have that
morning-after pill here?

79
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,760
That thing works.
Crush it up,
put it in her omelet,

80
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,720
"Hey, baby, breakfast
in bed." You can never
be too safe.

81
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,310
Oh, God.

82
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,600
I lost my wallet
somewhere.

83
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,440
All this together?

84
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,190
No, no.
Yes.

85
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,740
He is the man.

86
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,070
How much is it?
Oh. Plus this.

87
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,530
$20.42.

88
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,080
Watermelon.

89
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,040
Chicks dig it.

90
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,210
Thanks.

91
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,590
See you next time.

92
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,750
Have a good night.

93
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,420
I love these
energy drinks, man.

94
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,420
I'm almost, like, kind of on
an energy drink cleanse,

95
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,680
where I do one for breakfast
and then, like, two
or three for lunch.

96
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,050
l'm the man?

97
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,390
Yeah, right,
Barry, l'm the man.

98
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,890
ln fact, l'm so much the man,

99
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,690
l have a standing prescription
for medication to control
my anxiety attacks.

100
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,820
God, I wish I had
something else
to relieve my stress.

101
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,530
Hello, Wesley.

102
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,280
You know,
there are people,
beautiful people,

103
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,120
you just wish they could see
you in a different setting,
a different place,

104
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,660
instead of where you are,
what you've become.

105
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,500
Nicole is so hot.

106
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,250
What?

107
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,170
Boom goes the dynamite.

108
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,130
But most of all,
you wish you weren't
such a pussy

109
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,380
for wishing for things
that will never change.

110
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,060
Good God A'mighty,
you're over here like
it's spring fucking break,

111
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,430
and I still don't have
that billing report.

112
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,150
Why do I even
keep you around, Wesley?

113
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,810
I'll get it done, Janice.

114
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,070
Like I never
heard that before.
"I'll get it done."

115
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,450
"I'll get it done.
I'll get it done, Janice.

116
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,280
"I'll get it done."

117
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,920
Why don't you have
anything to say
for yourself?

118
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,920
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,050
Well, you're worthless.

120
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,180
I'm the one who's sorry
I hired your ass.

121
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,080
You know what
the best thing is about
the end of the day?

122
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,170
Tomorrow it starts
all over again.

123
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,040
Hi. How you doing?
Good.

124
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,630
I'm sorry?
You apologize too much.

125
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,350
Sorry about that.

126
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,570
I knew your father.

127
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,030
My father left
the week I was born,
so...

128
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,330
Your father died yesterday
on the rooftop of
the Metropolitan Building.

129
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,750
Sorry.

130
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,750
Look, the liquor rounds
are just over there, so...

131
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,470
Your father was one of
the greatest assassins
who ever lived.

132
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,180
The man who killed him
is behind you.

133
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,340
This guy's just
shooting up...

134
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,770
Sorry. Sorry.

135
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,540
What... Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
What the fuck just happened?

136
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,590
Please! Please!
Please drive faster.

137
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,550
Please be quiet.
Please drive...
Please drive faster.

138
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,100
Please... Please understand
that I care about my life!

139
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,480
I don't know what the fuck
you did to piss this guy off,

140
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,530
but you're gonna
have to let me out
and call the cops!

141
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,820
Hey! Hey!

142
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,330
What are you doing?
Oh, shit! Are you crazy?

143
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,580
Oh, shit!

144
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,970
I think we lost him.
I think we lost him.

145
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,260
Could you let me out
at the next corner, please?

146
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,930
Shit!

147
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,930
Fuck!

148
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,110
Oh, shit!

149
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,030
He's right there!

150
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,540
Look, I'm an accountant.
I'm just an accountant.

151
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,630
Oh, fuck!

152
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,800
He's fucking persistent,
you know.

153
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,430
Fuck!

154
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,690
You kick his ass!

155
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,900
Shoot him!

156
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,030
What are you doing?
What are you shooting
our car for, huh?

157
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,530
Are you crazy?
Grab the wheel.

158
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,080
Where are you going?

159
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,420
Get back in here!

160
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,500
Oh, my God!

161
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,230
Oh, damn! I'm sorry.

162
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,320
Gun!
What?

163
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,620
Under the seat!

164
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,870
Here.

165
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,820
Oh, shit!

166
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,280
Shit!

167
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,490
Look out!
Get out!

168
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,830
Look out! Oh, my God!

169
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,210
Shit!

170
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,050
I'm sorry!

171
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,240
Behind you!

172
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,370
Fuck.

173
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,330
Shit. Shit.

174
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,630
Hello.

175
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,880
I don't have any money or...

176
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,970
I thought he'd be

177
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,680
taller.

178
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,100
Taller?

179
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,720
Sir...

180
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,100
Sir, I've been trying
to explain to the lady here
that I'm an accountant.

181
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,900
I'm an account service
representative... I'm
an account manager.

182
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,990
And I'm sure
that if you call
my boss, Janice,

183
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,910
she'd fill you in
on whatever
has gone wrong.

184
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,240
You can contact her
by email or...
She'll put you straight.

185
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,580
Shoot the wings
off the flies.

186
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,830
I don't know
what that means.

187
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,750
Shoot the wings
off the flies.

188
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,010
I really think
you have me mixed up
with somebody else.

189
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,930
On three.

190
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,770
Either you shoot,
or I do.

191
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,280
One.

192
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,570
Okay.

193
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,250
Two.

194
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,380
I can't even see them!

195
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,170
Three.

196
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,280
Okay. Okay.

197
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,420
That's impossible.

198
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,970
A lot of things
for you weren't possible
before today.

199
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,970
What you experienced, Wesley,
was not a panic attack.

200
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,440
Your heart was beating
in excess of 400 beats
per minute,

201
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,190
sending abundant amounts
of adrenaline into
your bloodstream.

202
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,440
This allows you to see
and react faster than normal.

203
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,490
Only a few people
in the world can do that.

204
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,870
Your father could do it
and you can do it.

205
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,370
With a little work,
you can learn
to control these attacks.

206
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,250
Stay away from me.

207
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,460
Just stay back from me.

208
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,830
I have a gun, sir.
All right?

209
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,420
My name is Sloan.

210
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,760
This is Fox.

211
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,510
And the others you see
around you are all
very good at killing.

212
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,970
So, if I were you,
I'd keep the gun
pointed at me.

213
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
You don't wanna
point it at any of them.

214
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,730
That's better.

215
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,230
You're insane.
No.

216
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,400
Insanity is wasting
your life as a nothing

217
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,860
when you have
the blood of a killer
flowing in your veins.

218
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,440
Insanity is being shit on,
beat down,

219
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,990
coasting through life
in a miserable existence

220
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,200
when you have a caged lion
locked inside
and a key to release it.

221
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:04,750
This gun you're holding
is an Imanishi 17.
It belonged to your father.

222
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,710
He could conduct
a symphony orchestra
with it.

223
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,800
And you're going to use it
to kill the man who shot him
down in cold blood.

224
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,680
I can't...
The same man who tried
to kill you tonight.

225
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,600
Your father was one of us.

226
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,480
A fraternity of assassins.
The weapons of fate.

227
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,020
We've transferred
all of his assets
over to you.

228
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,480
And let me assure you,
they are substantial.

229
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,160
It is your
long-awaited destiny

230
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,740
to join us.

231
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,460
Back off. Back off.

232
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,720
You don't know
anything about me.

233
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,850
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.

234
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,060
You stay away from me?

235
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,440
You stay away from me, please?
Will you let me through?

236
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,350
You know when
you have a dream
and you're half awake,

237
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,470
but it's still in
the fringe of your brain?

238
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,350
Then you open your eyes
and you're so damn glad
it was a dream.

239
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,190
This was nothing like that.

240
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,720
I'm sorry.
Could you just give me
one second? Thank you.

241
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,740
Oh, shit.

242
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,370
Wesley.

243
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Hey.

244
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,290
What's up with you?

245
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,590
What do you mean?

246
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,010
You're... You're here early.

247
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,720
Is... You seem
a little pepped up.

248
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,350
You all right?
Well, yeah.

249
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,430
Yeah.

250
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,060
I guess I feel

251
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,980
kind of different.

252
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,190
Whatever. I'm gonna go
get some Post-it Notes.
Do you want one?

253
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,360
No.
Really?

254
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,200
Yeah.
Okay.

255
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,050
Jesus H. fucking Popsicle,
I still don't have
my billing reports,

256
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,010
but you've got time
to sit here
and Google your ass off.

257
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,640
Well, I know one thing.

258
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,220
You've got your review
coming up next week,

259
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,520
and I can't wait to start
checking me off
some big fucking boxes.

260
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,480
Attitude, poor!
Performance, poor!

261
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,070
Management skills, poor!

262
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,400
Works well with others.
That's a fucking joke.

263
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,160
What is this bullshit?
Who's this prick?

264
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Some loser gets
his head blown off
at the Metropolitan...

265
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,490
Shut the fuck up!

266
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,960
She has one single
iota of tenuous power.

267
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,880
She thinks she can
push everyone around.

268
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,180
You don't need this.

269
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,930
I understand.

270
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,730
Junior high must have
been kind of tough,

271
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,440
but it doesn't give you the
right to treat your workers
like horseshit, Janice.

272
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,900
I know we laugh at you,
Janice.

273
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,950
We all know you keep
your stash of jelly donuts in
the top drawer of your desk.

274
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,120
But I want you to know

275
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,710
if you weren't such a bitch,
we'd feel sorry for you.

276
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,130
I do feel sorry for you.

277
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,920
But as it stands,
the way you behave,

278
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,720
I feel I can speak
for the entire office

279
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,220
when I tell you

280
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,060
go fuck yourself.

281
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,570
Yeah. That was great, bro.
Who's the man?

282
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,170
I'm the man.

283
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,160
That's a bad idea.

284
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,040
Couldn't find
your keys, huh?

285
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,880
That could be handy.
You going to teach me that?

286
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,630
I might need that.

287
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,890
So, Fox, right?
What is that?
Is that a call sign?

288
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,680
Is it like Maverick
in Top Gun?

289
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,850
You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me?

290
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,730
I'm just kidding.

291
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,800
Peter!

292
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,890
Check the shuttle rotation
on this STB.
It should be 300 per minute.

293
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,520
This kind of cotton weave,
the opposing thread count
should be 4,000.

294
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,060
Hey, this is
pretty awesome, huh?

295
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,020
Is it a front?

296
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,570
Front for what?
I don't know.

297
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,240
Assassinations.

298
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,450
You may think this is
a front for something,

299
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,290
all I can tell you
is this is a textile mill.

300
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,330
And George...
George, go help
Peter up there.

301
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,540
Yeah.

302
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,880
This is a textile mill.

303
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,420
And a damn good one.

304
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,340
Yeah, that's cute,
but that's bullshit, right?

305
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,640
I mean, all these guys
are killers, aren't they?

306
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,100
I think you owe me
some answers.

307
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,270
All right.
Clearly I don't understand,

308
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,190
but do you make sweaters
or do you kill people?

309
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,880
That's an awful lot
of questions over coffee.

310
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,060
Are you sure
you're ready
for the answers?

311
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,810
Yes, I'm sure.

312
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,560
I can't go back.

313
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,310
Not to my life.

314
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,490
He's all yours.

315
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,240
All right. We're up.

316
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,630
How you doing?

317
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,290
I'm The Repairman.

318
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,170
What do you repair?

319
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,590
A lifetime of bad habits.

320
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,100
Okay.
Would you do me a favor?

321
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,640
Just put your arms
behind your back.

322
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Uh...

323
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,230
It's okay.
I don't know...

324
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,980
Just behind your back.
Is this okay?

325
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,440
Just relax.

326
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,270
Is this part of it?

327
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,860
There we go.

328
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,900
You going to put a bag
over my head?

329
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,610
No.
There's no need for a bag.

330
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,910
That's not too tight, is it?
No, that's nice.

331
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,710
Why did you come here, Wesley?

332
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,630
Well, you brought me here,
remember?

333
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,010
What the fuck
did you do that...

334
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,520
How many punches
did The Repairman throw

335
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,990
before he was counting sheep?

336
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,660
Well, I haven't spent
a lot of time having my face
smashed in before, all right?

337
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,330
Did you spend
a lot of time
with knives?

338
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,250
At breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

339
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,830
Fuck.

340
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,090
It was a rhetorical
question, culo.

341
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,470
You interrupt me again,
I use the business end.

342
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,340
Here's what you need
to know, puto.

343
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,680
Knives are easy to hide.

344
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,350
They don't jam
and they never
run out of bullets.

345
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,980
They come in handy

346
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,690
when you have to do some
close contact work.

347
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,610
What the fuck, man?

348
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,580
Come here. Come here.
What?

349
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,370
Now, try to cut me.
What?

350
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,960
Try to cut me. Hey!

351
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,340
Just stick me with that...
Be careful with that.
That's sharp.

352
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,550
Just stick
and stick and stick.
Why?

353
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,180
Seriously, man,
I could hurt you.
Hey!

354
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,180
Okay, pussy.

355
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,100
I'm not a pussy.
You're a pussy.

356
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,810
No, I'm not a pussy.
You're a pussy!

357
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,900
I'm not a pussy.
I got a healthy respect
for the human condition.

358
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,730
Fuck that, you pussy!
I'm not a pussy!

359
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,940
You're a pussy!
I'm not a pussy!

360
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,480
Come on, pussy.
I'm not a pussy!

361
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,590
Hi. How you doing?

362
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,840
What the fuck?

363
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,510
The fuck!

364
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,930
Just a moment.
Just a moment.

365
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,560
Sorry.

366
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,520
Hello? Hey!

367
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,690
Hey, come back! Hey!

368
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,520
You must drink.
Drink. Yeah.

369
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,580
What is this?
This is the recovery room.

370
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,710
This bath stimulates
white blood cells
and speed up the process.

371
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,330
In here, bruises, cuts, breaks
heal in hours, not days.

372
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,790
You shitting me?

373
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,380
Shh.

374
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,220
What is that? Vodka?
Yeah.

375
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,220
Are you Russian?
Yeah.

376
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,640
Get up.

377
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,850
This is The Gunsmith.

378
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,440
He knows more about a piece
than anybody, and he's gonna
teach you how to use one.

379
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,360
How you doing?
Pretty good.

380
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,320
You know that
Seltzer broke his leg?
Oh, really?

381
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,360
Yeah, in three places.

382
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,280
How'd he do that?
Jumped off a building.

383
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,660
So, is he okay?
Yeah.
It's pretty bad, though.

384
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,370
Oh, my God.

385
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Oh, my God, you guys,
that is so realistic.

386
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,090
He's been in recovery for,
like, three days now,

387
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,300
and they say they're not even
gonna let him out.

388
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,520
Oh, my God.

389
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,270
Oh, my God.

390
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,020
Oh, my God!

391
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,530
Hey, we can't shoot
a dead woman! She might
be somebody's mom...

392
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,370
You need to know
what it's like to put
a bullet in a body.

393
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,620
Why are you here?

394
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:42,670
You know, I thought
I was learning to be
some kind of super assassin.

395
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,250
You know,
if I wanted to get beat up,

396
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,380
I would have
stayed in my cubicle,
you know.

397
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,850
Fuck.

398
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,190
All right,
shoot the target.

399
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,450
From there.

400
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,160
You want me
shoot through Wilbur?

401
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,830
I want you
to curve the bullet.

402
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,080
How am I suppose to do that?

403
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,370
It's not a question of how,

404
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,750
it's a question of what.

405
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,000
If no one told you
that bullets flew straight

406
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,300
and I gave you a gun
and told you to
hit the target,

407
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,170
what would you do?

408
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,510
Let your instincts guide you.

409
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,940
How the hell
did he do that?

410
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,820
Can you do that?
Can you do that? Hello?

411
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,950
Hey, I think
that's my old train.

412
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,410
Still is.

413
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,300
Shit! You fucking asshole!

414
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,720
Come on!

415
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,520
Let's go.

416
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,020
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

417
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,570
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

418
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:02,220
Oh, God, I feel...
I feel... I feel...

419
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,520
I feel kind of good.

420
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,650
He got Rictus.
Perfect shot.
Impossible angle.

421
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,280
Cross is taking us out
one by one.

422
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,460
And Wesley is the only one
who can get to him.

423
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,630
Cross gets closer
with each hour.

424
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,800
Get back to work.

425
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,470
See that?

426
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,850
It's a shuttle.
Okay.

427
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,430
I want you to try
and catch it.

428
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,100
You want me to
stick my hand
in there?

429
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,360
Yes. I want you to catch it.

430
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,530
You wanna put a gun
to my head?

431
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,450
I can just slow things down
like with the flies.

432
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,620
You need to learn
to control that
by yourself.

433
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,100
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

434
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,890
This is bullshit! Fuck this!

435
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,320
How's it going today,
Wesley?

436
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,450
No. Fuck the loom
and fuck The Repairman!

437
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,330
I can shoot the wings
off the back of a fly!
I'm ready!

438
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,700
You're ready when Fox
says you're ready.

439
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,290
Who put her in charge?
I did.

440
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,550
Wesley.

441
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,300
People think you use cheese
to catch these beauties.

442
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,100
But they go apeshit
for peanut butter.

443
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:13,810
Your father was
a big fan of this.
Watch.

444
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,030
Plastic explosive
and peanut butter!

445
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,400
Sorry, Mickey.

446
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,160
Five, four, three, two, one.

447
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,170
Hey. Hey, Russian.

448
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,300
Good for one. Yeah.

449
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,510
Imagine if you had
a thousand.

450
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,310
They really fucked you up,
didn't they?

451
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,020
What the hell
did they do to you?

452
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,650
Throw you in front of
a moving train for no reason?

453
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,810
Beat the shit out of you?

454
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:03,990
You know, you can say it,
this place is bullshit.
It's bullshit, huh?

455
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,360
Bullshit!

456
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,370
Repairman. Five minutes.

457
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,250
Heads up out of the question?

458
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,260
Fuck.

459
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,760
You're a waste
of my fucking time!
Why are you here?

460
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,890
I don't know, so hit me.

461
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,860
Why are you here?
I had a shit life,
so why wouldn't I?

462
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,950
I wanna kick your fucking ass!

463
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:52,740
Tell me what
you want me to say.

464
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,370
Why are you here?
I don't know!

465
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,080
Why are you here?

466
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,760
Why are you here?
I don't know why I'm here.

467
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,590
Why are you here?

468
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,800
Why are you here?

469
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,970
I don't know who I am.

470
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,190
What did you say?
I said...

471
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,440
I said I don't know who I am.

472
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,750
Do you really want
to know who you are?

473
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,890
Yeah. It's my room.

474
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,720
No.

475
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,600
This was your father's room.

476
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,370
What happened?

477
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,960
A member of this
fraternity went rogue.

478
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,620
Cross.

479
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,050
He started by killing
the one man who was
better than him.

480
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,760
Your father.

481
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,550
Blindsided him
on a rooftop.

482
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,890
Betrayed him.

483
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,190
Everything in this room,

484
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:45,820
books, weapons, clothes,

485
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,150
belonged to him.

486
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,280
Now they belong to you.

487
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,160
Find a connection
in this room, Wesley.

488
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:58,740
It may be the only way
of finding out who you are.

489
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,440
Now l know
why l could never care
about anything before this.

490
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,150
l was living a lie.

491
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,320
Finally,
l have a chance to step
into my father's shoes.

492
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,950
Grow a pair.
Live the life
l was born to live.

493
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,910
l've been pissing it
all away like it was another
fucking billing report.

494
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,660
l have to train harder.

495
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,330
l have to be as good
as my father.

496
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,970
On these shelves,
Wesley, are the records
of the Fraternity kills,

497
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,260
everything you will need
to kill your target.

498
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,930
To kill Cross,

499
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:06,770
the man who betrayed
the Fraternity and murdered
my father, l must prepare.

500
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,190
l have to become his student,
memorize every move
he ever made,

501
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,690
every attack he ever executed.

502
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,870
When he dropped a patient
in an airtight room surrounded
by Secret Service agents.

503
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,750
When he took out that
businessman in the elevator.

504
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,920
His bullets untraceable,
of course.

505
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,050
Or how no matter
what the weapon or how
he eliminated his target,

506
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,350
he was always
one chess move ahead.

507
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,640
One move more prepared.

508
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,980
One step quicker.

509
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,400
One shot more precise.

510
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,990
ln fact, in all my research,
l found that he never
missed a target.

511
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,410
Not until me.

512
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,100
Yeah!

513
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:58,150
First time in your life,
Wesley, you're in control.

514
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,110
Shoot the target.

515
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,540
You're crazy.

516
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,630
Welcome to the Fraternity.

517
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,270
We call this
the Loom of Fate.

518
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:13,910
After today,
you will never
set foot in here again.

519
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,330
Why not?

520
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,830
Because, like an apostle,

521
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,540
your task is not to interpret,
but to deliver.

522
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,220
Every culture in history
has a secret code,

523
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,390
one you won't find
in traditional texts.

524
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,770
A thousand years ago,

525
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:39,190
a clan of weavers
discovered a mystical language
hidden in the fabric.

526
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:44,110
They called themselves
the Fraternity.

527
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,820
I'll be honest with you,
all I see are threads.

528
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,320
Come here.

529
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,830
Look there.

530
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,000
Do you see that one thread
that missed the weave

531
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,620
and lies on top of the others?

532
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:02,750
Like a mistake?
No, it's a code.

533
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,050
If the vertical thread
is on top, it's a one.

534
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,510
If it's below, it's a zero.

535
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,050
Binary code?

536
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,810
What does it say?

537
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:17,390
It's a name.

538
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,730
A target.

539
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,190
Where do the names
come from?

540
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,820
Come out of a necessity,
Wesley.

541
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,900
A necessity to maintain
balance in the world.

542
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:34,200
They are orders
that must be executed,

543
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:40,080
entrusted to us so that
we might forge
stability out of chaos.

544
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,590
This one is yours.

545
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,130
I don't...

546
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,720
Look, I thought
you brought me here
to kill Cross.

547
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,100
You will.

548
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,600
In time.

549
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,310
This is your first assignment.

550
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,560
The loom provides,

551
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,560
I interpret,

552
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,070
you deliver.

553
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:11,780
You want me to kill
Robert Deane Darden?

554
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,450
Not me.

555
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:17,120
Fate.

556
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,340
The target will be
in the conference room,
sitting at the head chair.

557
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,380
There are six windows.

558
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,340
You will shoot
through the fifth.

559
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,730
Fifth window.

560
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,400
Now.

561
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,850
What did he do
that he deserves to die?

562
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,470
You don't know.

563
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,150
I don't know if he was bad,
I don't know if he was evil.

564
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:30,110
I don't know
anything about him.

565
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,610
We get our orders from a loom.

566
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:35,610
Fate.

567
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:40,280
And we're suppose to
take it on faith that
what we're doing is right.

568
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,540
Killing someone
we know nothing about,

569
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,960
I don't know if I can do that.

570
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,060
About 20 years ago,

571
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,520
there was this girl.

572
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,560
Her dad was a federal judge,

573
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:15,400
so she probably had it in
her mind that she was gonna
follow in his footsteps.

574
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,040
So she's home one Christmas,

575
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,120
and her dad's on this big
racketeering case.

576
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:29,500
The defendants want
to get a softer judge.

577
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
One they can buy off.

578
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,050
So they hire this guy,

579
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,090
Max Petridge,

580
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,140
get him to pay her father
a visit.

581
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,940
And the way he pays
people a visit

582
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,400
is to break in

583
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,190
and tie up their loved ones,

584
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,610
and force them to watch

585
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,280
while he burns
his targets alive.

586
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,960
And then he takes
a wire hanger
and twists it round

587
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,840
and brands his initials
into each one of them so
they will never ever forget.

588
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,560
After I was recruited
into the Fraternity,

589
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:30,980
I found out
that Max Petridge's name
had come up

590
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,310
weeks before
the federal judge
was killed,

591
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:39,150
and that a Fraternity member
had failed to pull
the trigger.

592
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,700
We don't know
how far the ripples
of our decisions go.

593
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,250
You kill one, and maybe,

594
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,670
save a thousand.

595
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,590
That's the code
of the Fraternity.

596
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:01,260
That's what we believe in,
and that's why we do it.

597
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,490
Now!

598
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,490
Cross.

599
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,910
Not yet.

600
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,920
Your target will be
in a black limo.

601
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,670
He always travels the same
six blocks of Halsted.

602
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,840
You have three blocks
to kill him.

603
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,560
Shit.

604
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,810
I'm sorry.

605
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,290
Barry!
Could you feed Annabelle?

606
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,580
Barry!

607
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,010
Wesley. Hey,
where have you been?
I have really missed you, man.

608
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,220
Look at the big man.
You fucking asshole! What?

609
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,510
What? You don't
show up for weeks,

610
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,230
now you're just gonna stop by
and use the bathroom?

611
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:59,770
You think you're a real
big shot now, huh?

612
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:02,270
No. You know what?
You are nothing!

613
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,730
No, you are less than nothing.

614
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:08,110
You're not even half
the man that Barry is.

615
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:12,660
Barry, he pleases me
in ways that you've never
even heard of!

616
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:19,830
Who the hell is she, Wesley?
Your new whore?

617
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,170
Is that what it takes now?
You're paying for it?

618
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,080
Wesley?

619
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,080
He's the man.

620
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,010
You all right?
Yeah.

621
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,680
Yeah. I'm okay.
Go sit down.
I'm gonna find a car.

622
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,600
Big night.
I got to get into recovery.

623
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,160
Shit.

624
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,120
Fuck!

625
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,140
Bull's-eye.

626
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,980
What's he doing here?

627
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,170
Come on!
Come on. Just stay with us.

628
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,670
Pull back his jacket.

629
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:58,130
Breathe. Breathe, all right?

630
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,850
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.

631
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:06,140
A thousand.

632
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,600
Come on!

633
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:11,350
Come on!
No! No! Stay with us.

634
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,610
Come on.
Open your eyes!

635
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:14,020
Come on!

636
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,150
Come on!

637
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,820
Come on!

638
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,710
This bullet is the first
traceable bullet
he's ever used.

639
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,420
It was made by this man.
His name is Pekwarsky.

640
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,970
He works out of
what is now a monastery
in Eastern Moravia.

641
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:24,010
This place is where
the Fraternity was born.

642
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,980
He's taunting me.

643
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,100
He's sending me a message.

644
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:34,730
I'm gonna send him one back.

645
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,730
He's trapping you.

646
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,150
Leading you to a place
he knows very well.

647
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,150
Look, I know this. I...

648
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,820
This is what
you trained me for.

649
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,280
You can't go alone.

650
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:50,540
I go alone
or he doesn't show.
He's not stupid.

651
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:55,580
Look, a member
of the Fraternity is dead
because of me.

652
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:02,220
Okay.

653
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:05,680
Go.

654
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,970
Thank you.

655
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,400
I don't think
that's a good idea.

656
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,000
Your next assignment.

657
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,970
Pekwarsky?

658
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:50,240
Shit.

659
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,290
What are you doing here?

660
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:02,340
Lower your gun.

661
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,470
You recognize this?

662
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:17,430
I pulled this
out of my shoulder.

663
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,140
The guy who put it there
killed my father.

664
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:22,440
Now, I know you made it,
so tell me where he is.

665
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:26,440
I did mold this,
but I can't be responsible
for the people who use them.

666
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:29,570
I don't give a shit.
Tell me where he is.

667
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,320
Look at my finger.

668
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:36,040
I can try and arrange a meet.

669
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:02,350
Have you ever thought about
doing things differently?

670
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,060
How do you mean?

671
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,730
I don't know.

672
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,900
Being somebody else.

673
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,860
Somebody normal.

674
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,080
No.

675
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,210
Shit.

676
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:30,630
Out of the way!

677
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:02,160
Stay.

678
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,100
Hey!

679
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,190
He's on the train.

680
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,020
He's alone.

681
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,860
Thank you.

682
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,840
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!

683
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:59,430
Sir, sit down!
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

684
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,600
Sir, sit... Sit down!
Sir, sit down!

685
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,530
Get out of the way! Sit down!
Stay down! Stay down!

686
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:19,450
Stay down! It's okay!
Sit down!

687
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,250
Wesley.

688
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:42,220
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

689
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:55,290
No, no, no!

690
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,790
Wesley, listen to me.

691
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:35,830
Shut the fuck up!

692
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:38,080
You don't get to talk to me.

693
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:39,710
You don't get to talk to me.

694
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:42,630
Everything they told you
was a lie.

695
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,800
Shut up,
you lying piece of shit.
You shut the fuck up.

696
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,340
You are my son.

697
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,140
What did you say?

698
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,730
What did you say to me?

699
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:32,010
Is it true?

700
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,850
Yes.

701
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:41,690
Why did you make me do this?

702
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:44,980
Because you are
the only person
he wouldn't kill.

703
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,740
You knew, God damn it.

704
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:54,120
You knew the entire time.

705
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,200
Well, his name came up.

706
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:00,790
So did yours.

707
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,130
No, it was okay.
Never mind.

708
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:53,220
No. No, it was complete shit.

709
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,120
I promised your father
I'd bring you back here.

710
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,780
What the fuck?

711
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:21,950
He said
it was the only way
you'd believe.

712
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,630
Your father
was never more than
a camera click away.

713
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,110
That's me.

714
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,070
He was my father.

715
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,080
And I killed him.

716
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:05,410
To your father, protecting you
was worth giving up his life.

717
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,040
Protect me?

718
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,210
He was trying
to fucking kill me!

719
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:15,010
No. He wasn't trying
to kill you.

720
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,890
He was trying to rescue you.

721
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:26,440
When Cross
left the Fraternity,

722
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,520
Sloan hunted you down.

723
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:35,150
Ever since Fox had her teeth
in you, he's been trying
to separate you from them.

724
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:41,410
Your father never wanted you
in the Fraternity, Wesley.

725
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:45,290
He wanted a different
path for you,

726
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:53,300
with things that
he could never have.

727
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,340
A home.

728
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,970
Peace.
No.

729
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:01,550
He hoped you would
find your own way.

730
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,440
Your father got
hold of this.

731
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,400
Decipher it yourself.

732
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:26,160
Sloan began manufacturing
targets of his own
for profit years ago.

733
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,500
Your father found out
about it.

734
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,340
And he was going
to do something about it
on his own, right?

735
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,210
But Sloan turned
everyone against him.

736
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,760
My father's name never
even came up, did it?

737
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:41,840
No. Holding to the code
made him a target.

738
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,640
Yes.

739
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,450
You want me to run?
No.

740
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,950
I want you to live.

741
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:11,080
You can have
a different life, Wesley.

742
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,500
Like your father
wanted for you.

743
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,170
We trained him well.

744
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:29,300
My father
was wrong about one thing.

745
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:32,100
Everything they told me
wasn't a lie.

746
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:35,480
They taught me how to kill,
how to feel no pain,

747
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,560
and most importantly,
that every job has
a perfect weapon.

748
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:45,690
Well, l'm the perfect weapon.

749
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:49,780
And l'm supposed to run?

750
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:52,450
No, l've been doing that
my entire life.

751
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:54,870
So l say no.

752
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:58,960
l say kill them all
and let fate
sort out the mess.

753
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:55,140
Kill him.

754
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:49,610
He's here!

755
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:00,970
Pussy.

756
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,050
Pussy, pussy.

757
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:19,950
Pussy, pussy.

758
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,280
Pussy.

759
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,980
Sloan!

760
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:54,250
My father wasn't a traitor.

761
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:59,500
This is a kill order.

762
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:04,510
And it's got
Sloan's name on it.

763
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:09,890
What did you say to me?

764
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,850
It's a name. It's a target.

765
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:18,270
I don't want this person dead.

766
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:20,650
Fate does.

767
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:26,240
Fate wanted you dead.

768
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,990
And he couldn't take it.

769
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:34,080
So he started manufacturing
his own targets
for his own gains.

770
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:38,920
And that's when my dad
found out and decided
to stand against him.

771
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,710
And that's
when you sent
a man's son

772
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,760
to kill his father.

773
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,640
You're not
an assassin of fate,
Sloan.

774
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:56,230
You're just a thug
who can bend bullets.

775
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,290
Is that true?

776
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,420
Here is what the truth is.

777
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,050
Your name came up.

778
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:41,980
Your name came up.

779
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,000
Your name came up.

780
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,330
Your name.

781
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,340
Your name.

782
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,340
Yours.

783
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:10,800
Everyone in this room.

784
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:18,850
If I had not done
what I did,

785
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:23,190
you would all be dead.

786
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,820
I saved your lives.

787
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:33,450
Now look where we are.
We are stronger than ever.

788
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:37,660
Changing the course
of history as we see it.

789
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,040
Choosing the targets
we select.

790
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:47,960
We can redistribute power
where we see fit.

791
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:52,090
The wolves rule.

792
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:55,550
Not the sheep.

793
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,930
Now, if any of you feel
the need to follow the code

794
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:03,480
of the Fraternity
to the letter,

795
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:08,070
I invite you to take your gun,

796
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:11,030
put it in your mouth
and pull the trigger.

797
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,330
That is what Wesley demands.

798
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:20,370
Otherwise,

799
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,830
shoot this motherfucker

800
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:26,210
and let us take
our Fraternity of
Assassins to heights

801
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:28,960
reserved only
for the gods of men.

802
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,260
You choose.

803
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,900
Fuck the code.

804
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:56,510
Sloan!

805
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:24,200
Sloan!

806
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:44,390
Six weeks ago,
l was ordinary and pathetic.

807
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,140
Just like you.

808
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,020
But who am l now?

809
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:57,150
Account manager?

810
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:00,860
Assassin?

811
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:07,080
Or just another tool
who was mind-fucked
into killing his father?

812
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:10,750
l am all of these.

813
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,710
And l am none of these.

814
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:18,050
Who am l now?

815
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,120
This is not me
fulfilling my destiny.

816
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:00,300
This is not me following
in my father's footsteps.

817
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,760
This is definitely not me
saving the world.

818
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:29,160
Still trying
to figure out
who you are?

819
01:41:30,330 --> 01:41:32,410
This is not me.

820
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:37,840
This is just
a motherfucking decoy.

821
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:45,840
Oh, fuck.

822
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:52,770
This is me taking control.

823
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:55,810
From Sloan,

824
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:58,480
from the Fraternity,

825
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:02,360
from Janice,
from billing reports,

826
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,150
from ergonomic keyboards,

827
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:08,950
from cheating girlfriends
and sack-of-shit best friends.

828
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:13,540
This is me taking back control

829
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:15,870
of my life.

830
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,880
What the fuck
have you done lately?
