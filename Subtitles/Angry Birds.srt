Hi, Red. (CHUCKLES)

328
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,551
Hello, birds I won't get to know well.

329
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,256
Hey, apparently somebody didn't get
the memo that we like to start on time

330
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,296
because you're about two minutes late.

331
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,360
Don't let it happen again.

332
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Hi, my name is Chuck.

333
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,496
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

334
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,714
I like you a lot. I can tell.

335
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,155
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

336
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,199
Now, Red, would you like to
share your story with us?

337
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,429
No, not really.

338
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,478
Well, the court mentioned
something about a rage episode

339
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,835
at a child's birthday party.

340
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,031
How long is this class, anyway?

341
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,475
As long as you make it.

342
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,152
- Really? Oh, okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

343
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,789
Uh, gentlemen, very nice to see you,
and to almost meet you.

344
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,816
Probably the nicest part of it
is not getting to meet you,

345
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,456
- you know, in some weird way.
- (BOTH GROAN)

346
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,357
All right, so I'm gonna go ahead

347
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,069
and scoot on back out
past those creepy statues and, uh...

348
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,957
(GRUNTS) Back you go.

349
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,076
- Sure. No, I can take a seat.
- (HUMMING)

350
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,196
So, in another sense,

351
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,037
you are here until I notify the court
that your anger issues have been resolved.

Chuck!

355
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,039
Share your story with Red.

356
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,190
Me? I am the last guy who should be here.

357
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,633

358
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,474
Judge tells me I was going too fast,
so I say, "Your Honor, to be honest, I was.

359
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,595
"You caught me."

360
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,113
I'm not angry. I'm honest.

361
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,310
So, shouldn't I be in
honesty management class?

362
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,630
'Cause we gotta manage my honesty.

363
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,909
Mmm-hmm.

364
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,591
My one problem, that's a different story
than you told last time.
