1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:32,753
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:34,553
Excuse me. Coming through.

4
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:38,396
<i>Tonight, so-called
magician Lionel Shrike</i>

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,898
<i>is making another sad
attempt for attention</i>

6
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:44,336
<i>by performing what he calls
an impossible feat.</i>

7
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:47,813
<i>The safe is made of
the strongest iron.</i>

8
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:51,016
<i>It can't be sawed through or pried.</i>

9
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:55,372
<i>Yet, Lionel Shrike thinks
he's able to escape.</i>

10
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:57,284
Dad! Dad!

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,118
Hey, buddy.
You made it, huh?

12
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,595
Now, see that seat there?

13
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:07,161
It's the best
seat in the house.

14
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:11,471
Is Lionel Shrike the kind
of magician who can pull this off?

15
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:14,434
<i>Or is he actually
in over his head?</i>

16
00:01:14,504 --> 00:01:16,106
We'll see about that.

17
00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:18,501
- What's the matter?
- I don't want you to go.

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,740
Dylan, come on.
We talked about this.

19
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:23,136
Remember?
This is what I do.

20
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:25,693
I got to prove all
those naysayers wrong.

21
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:28,580
Okay? Besides...

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,730
I always keep
something up my sleeve.

23
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:33,887
Now, got your watch
like your dad's?

24
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:37,406
- Okay. How many seconds?
- Three hundred.

25
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:40,163
Three hundred. Maybe a few less.

26
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:45,395
Mmm.
I love you so much.

27
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,078
Okay. See you later, big man.

28
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:54,786
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lionel Shrike!

29
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,348
Will he be able
to hold his breath?

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,102
Will he be able to
somehow escape the safe?

31
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,891
Three, two, one...

32
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:14,729
Two, three,

33
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:19,361
four, five, six,
seven, eight...

34
00:02:20,238 --> 00:02:27,240
296... 297, 298, 299, 300.

35
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,470
303, 304...

36
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:36,232
<i>It's five minutes now,</i>

37
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:41,666
<i>and we have not seen or heard
anything from Lionel Shrike yet.</i>

38
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:42,896
Move!

39
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:45,334
Dad!

40
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:49,089
Dad! Dad!

41
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:52,411
Let go of me!

42
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:54,405
Dad!

43
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:57,564
No! Dad!

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,726
Dad! Let go!

45
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,081
Find him!

46
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:24,460
<i>The Eye.</i>

47
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,174
<i>It may not lie...</i>

48
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:30,775
<i>But don't think for a moment
that it can't be lied to.</i>

49
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:35,367
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

50
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:37,364
<i>But is it truth?</i>

51
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:41,919
<i>People see the Horsemen
as noble Robin Hoods. Are they?</i>

52
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:45,156
<i>Or are they common thieves?</i>

53
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,074
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

54
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,314
<i>Here's what you know.</i>

55
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:52,946
<i>They robbed a bank in Paris
from a stage in Las Vegas.</i>

56
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,674
<i>They fleeced
an insurance magnate</i>

57
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:56,312
<i>of hundreds of
millions of dollars</i>

58
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:59,030
<i>and disappeared from
a roof in New York.</i>

59
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:03,339
<i>Always showering their
devoted fans with money.</i>

60
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,302
<i>Here's what you don't know.</i>

61
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,499
<i>They left one man behind.</i>

62
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:11,014
<i>Framed. Holding the bag. Me.</i>

63
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:14,970
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

64
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:18,203
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

65
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,325
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

66
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:27,642
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you.</i>

67
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,075
<i>In ways you can't expect.</i>

68
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:33,067
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

69
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:39,982
<i>Because one thing I believe in
is an eye for an eye.</i>

70
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,182
<i>Welcome, Daniel Atlas.</i>

71
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:01,583
Who am I speaking to?

72
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:05,061
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

73
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:10,411
<i>You've asked many questions.
And registered many complaints.</i>

74
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,409
<i>You can rest assured
that we've heard you.</i>

75
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:14,060
Have you? Because I don't...

76
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:15,414
<i>- Trust?</i>
- No.

77
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:18,211
<i>Your leader?
Your fellow Horsemen?</i>

78
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,768
<i>Perhaps even us?</i>

79
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,805
I don't like that we've been
living in hiding for a year.

80
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:26,079
I don't like that every message
I get from Dylan is,

81
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,800
"Wait. Be patient.
The Eye has a plan."

82
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:31,268
<i>Wait. Be patient.</i>

83
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:32,552
<i>The Eye has a plan.</i>

84
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,593
This is games
and it's not working for me.

85
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:40,580
<i>You feel it is you who should be
leading the Horsemen, not Dylan.</i>

86
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:46,133
<i>If that is what you desire,
stay the course.</i>

87
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:48,212
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

88
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,086
<i>and remarkable mind
will not go unrecognized.</i>

89
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,769
<i>We have a new mission
for the Horsemen.</i>

90
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:57,923
<i>Dylan has a plan
and will gather you together soon.</i>

91
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,807
<i>Now leave!</i>

92
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:17,590
...North Carolina,
Florida, Maryland, Maine.

93
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,548
We're talking the entire
eastern seaboard.

94
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:21,540
I need to see some results.

95
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,424
Oh, hey. Oh, sorry.

96
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,588
Just real quick. Can I have you
for a couple of minutes?

97
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,307
I'm right in the middle
of something, Dylan.

98
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,744
No, I know. It's okay. Hey. Hey,
everybody. Sorry. Sorry about that.

99
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,337
Call the mayor.

100
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,804
Thanks a lot.
Twins, huh? Good.

101
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:37,052
Is he coming?

102
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:39,201
Look, I wouldn't have
brought you out of that meeting

103
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,767
unless it was something important.

104
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,202
It's about the Horsemen.

105
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:46,435
Somethings happening here
and it's happening now.

106
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:49,194
Message boards.
Elite magic society.

107
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,707
There is chatter going on
about the Horsemen

108
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:55,026
and something happening with Octa,
the giant software company.

109
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:56,143
I know what Octa is.

110
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:57,870
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but two months ago

111
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,906
we sent men to Philadelphia
because he knew...

112
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:02,303
- And I said that I was wrong.
- He knew that the Horsemen

113
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:04,030
were going to hit
the Euro-Atlantic Banking Summit.

114
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:05,109
- I have proof.
- Let him talk.

115
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,338
Thank you.
Communications.

116
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:11,412
Contact between who I think
might be Daniel Atlas

117
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:14,169
and who may be Merritt McKinney.

118
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,608
And what do you have?
Emails? Cell phones? Any transcripts?

119
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
- Pigeons.
- What?

120
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,203
I'm sorry,
you mean stool pigeons?

121
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:24,924
No, I mean actual pigeon pigeons.
Like carrier pigeons.

122
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:27,960
- Okay? Magicians work with pigeons.
- Doves.

123
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,479
Stay with me.

124
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:33,746
This pigeon, right here...

125
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:36,428
There's Daniel Atlas.
Same pigeon.

126
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,581
East Village.

127
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,263
Same pigeon, West Village.

128
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,101
42nd Street, pigeon. 65th Street.

129
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:45,063
All the way up to the
George Washington Bridge

130
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:49,736
on a sail boat with a guy that looks
just like Merritt McKinney.

131
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,218
And what does this all mean?

132
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:53,730
I know what it means.
It means nothing. It's bullshit.

133
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,486
- Could you sing a new song?
- No.

134
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,602
How is it that two years ago
you were so close...

135
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,334
You think I went out of my way
to screw up my own investigation?

136
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:01,612
You think I'm
that big of an idiot?

137
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,171
You know what I think now?
I think you're smart,

138
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:04,450
but you want everybody else
to think that you're an idiot.

139
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:06,440
Okay, stop.

140
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,557
Cowan, I know I'm new here,
but as far as I can tell,

141
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:11,867
people who don't even know you,
think you're an asshole.

142
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,275
- And you?
- Ma'am.

143
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:18,265
You don't know me, but my first year
in the Academy, you gave a talk.

144
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,738
The "long game" you called it.
You talked about a moral compass.

145
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,020
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

146
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:32,171
And I thought to myself, "That guy.
One day, I want to be that guy."

147
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:36,328
And now... A pigeon?

148
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,655
Technically, it was a few pigeons,
but I hear what you're saying.

149
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,254
Okay. So here's what
I'm going to do.

150
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,279
You want to take a vacation day?
Go on your own? Fine.

151
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:46,679
But I'm not going to devote resources
to another snipe hunt.

152
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,877
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

153
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:53,426
Boss, thank you. I promise you,
it won't be a snipe hunt.

154
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:55,550
We're gonna get those Horsemen.

155
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,067
She's great.

156
00:09:57,141 --> 00:10:00,301
The problem is when you're
two people at the same time,

157
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:01,898
one of them is bound
to trip the other.

158
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:05,142
And when that happens,
I will be there.

159
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:06,971
Duly noted.

160
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:29,958
- Oh. Hi!
- Who are you?

161
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,762
- What are you doing in my...
- It's actually a funny story.

162
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,388
How did you get into my apartment?
Whoa!

163
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:35,749
I think it's funny.
It's not like funny "ha ha."

164
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:37,948
Or you might not think
that it's funny "ha ha."

165
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,299
I think it's funny.
I guess it's all kind of relative.

166
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:42,299
I was actually...
No, that's not...

167
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,933
I made myself in the neighborhood
and now I'm here, and maybe...

168
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:49,929
Okay.

169
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:51,263
Seriously, how did you get in here?

170
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:53,685
Are you some kind of
crazed fan or something?

171
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:55,685
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I recognize you.

172
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:58,922
You did that B-grade "geek magic" thing,
didn't you? You pulled a...

173
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,254
Pulled a hat
out of the rabbit.

174
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:01,572
A hat out of the rabbit, that's right.

175
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:02,731
I know that it didn't work.

176
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:03,890
No, it was actually
kind of disgusting.

177
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,408
It was way worse for the rabbit.

178
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,831
Well, your drop was obvious
and your body shell is flimsy.

179
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:12,274
So if you wouldn't mind crawling out
from under my couch and...

180
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:18,541
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting
over here. Crazy!

181
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:22,302
By the way, that rabbit thing?
That was eight years ago, okay?

182
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,058
I've gotten so much
better since then.

183
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:25,463
- Have you?
- Yeah.

184
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:27,107
Okay, come here.
What is it that you want?

185
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:28,779
I wanted to meet you.
Everybody, really.

186
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,451
I want to be a part
of the Eye, okay?

187
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:33,210
I said it. I do.
And I want to use my magic for good,

188
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,967
like you and Merritt
and Jack especially.

189
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,095
Oh, that's right.
I know that Jack is alive.

190
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,453
I know that he
faked his own death.

191
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:43,318
I am a huge fan of faking deaths.
That was crazy!

192
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:44,958
What is this?
A trucker's hitch?

193
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,795
- Yeah.
- It's terrible.

194
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,951
- Embarrassing.
- Okay.

195
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,996
By the way, I am so sorry
that Henley left you.

196
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,873
- Ow! God!
- Sorry.

197
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:56,547
That's actually a little better.
You know what I heard?

198
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:57,746
- What?
- About Henley?

199
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,343
I heard that she got tired
of waiting around.

200
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:02,941
She lost faith
and so she asked for an out,

201
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,902
and the Eye gave it to her.

202
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:06,212
But who knows, right?

203
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,258
In matters of the heart,
so difficult to tell.

204
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,807
I mean, maybe she got sick of you.
You ever think about that?

205
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,217
Control issues?

206
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:14,100
Maybe you just didn't
tie her up tight enough. Ow!

207
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,487
Mmm.
Here's what's going to happen.

208
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,887
You're going to stay
here and stop talking,

209
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,403
and I'm going to
make a phone call,

210
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:21,837
and in about five minutes,
some people are going...

211
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,515
- It's all in the wrist.
- Uh-huh.

212
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:33,633
Let the momentum
of the card do the work for you.

213
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:34,829
Mmm-hmm.

214
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,710
This last one I call the Stall.

215
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,107
Not bad.

216
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,745
Now you want to see
a thing of beauty?

217
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:44,542
- I do indeed.
- Here you go.

218
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:46,852
And bingo bango bongo.

219
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,537
That's good. No, no, no,
it's good to be positive

220
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,130
despite making zero
progress in a year.

221
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,250
Yeah.

222
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,244
Whereas when it
comes to hypnotism,

223
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:58,765
the student has almost
become the master.

224
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,442
I like your confidence, but you might
say that you have the better teacher.

225
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:04,594
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

226
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:05,878
You're right.
You're right.

227
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,191
Your teacher definitely doesn't
know what he's doing.

228
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:10,230
By the way, was this
your card yesterday?

229
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:12,672
- In fact it was.
- I thought so.

230
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:14,343
That's not bad.

231
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,783
If I can hypnotize Danny
before you hit him with a card,

232
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:23,186
I get top bunk for a week.

233
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:25,176
Okay, that's a deal.

234
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,662
- Danny, what's up, man?
- Hey.

235
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:28,785
Stare at the palm of your hand
and as your eyes change focus,

236
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,139
you will begin to notice...

237
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:31,262
Everything, because
I'm not hypnotized.

238
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:34,332
It's not working.
Please don't become him.

239
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,086
I didn't know you guys did party tricks

240
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:37,896
when there weren't floozies around
to impress.

241
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,159
Uh, I think we stopped
trying to impress floozies

242
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,363
in, like, 1937.

243
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:44,521
Okay, somebody broke into my apartment,
all right?

244
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,355
Some amateur who knew
everything about me,

245
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:48,955
everything about Henley leaving,
and everything about us.

246
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,711
- That's her.
- Hey!

247
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:54,025
- Hi.
- You met Lula.

248
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:56,621
I've met her.
What is she doing here?

249
00:13:56,701 --> 00:14:01,782
I'm the new Horseman!
I'm the girl Horseman.

250
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:03,379
Whoo!

251
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:04,534
Yeah!

252
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:08,175
Nobody. No excitement.
Jack? Anything?

253
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:10,215
Dylan, tell me
what's going on here.

254
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:14,891
Well, Lula's been on the underground
scene for the last decade,

255
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,611
and I think she
has some real talent,

256
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:18,681
and I'd like to try her on stage

257
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,885
- to balance out the duo.
- What?

258
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:22,286
No, are you serious, man?

259
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,409
After Henley left, you said I could
get back on stage again.

260
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:25,843
Not someone who just showed up.

261
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:27,753
I told you I'd think about it,
and I have,

262
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,084
and I really need you behind the scenes
with me for a little while longer.

263
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:32,361
Dylan, come on. I've been
behind the scenes my whole life.

264
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:36,147
Which is a crime, might I add.
Have you seen that man's face?

265
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:40,018
Much as I appreciate the addition
of some femininity to the group,

266
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:42,336
over and above what Atlas provides,

267
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,734
I think the real issue
is we've been in this...

268
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:47,171
Yeah, the issue is that
we have been rehearsing for months

269
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,933
for something...
We don't even know what it is.

270
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:51,422
And you're going to
keep working until...

271
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:53,460
Until we work as a single organism.
I know, I've heard you say that.

272
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:54,739
The thing is, when you say that,

273
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:57,240
I think what you're
referring to is us, not you.

274
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,719
Listen, I'm getting my orders
directly from the Eye.

275
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,241
Okay? And then I give them to you.

276
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:02,891
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

277
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:05,676
No, I'm not going anywhere. But I'm...
Mmm. I'm taking care of myself.

278
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,087
Guys, can I just
weigh in here really quickly?

279
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,645
Because I think I see
what's going on here.

280
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:11,510
You guys are this amazing,
tight-knit family unit.

281
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:13,905
- I'm a new person...
- We are anything but a family.

282
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:18,030
Okay, well, my mother literally
knifed my father in the neck one time.

283
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:20,113
So you are actually
a little bit like my family unit.

284
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:21,376
- Literally?
- But, yeah.

285
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:23,377
It was an accident,
I think.

286
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:26,500
Okay. So, does this mean
we're actually going to do something?

287
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:28,651
Yes.

288
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:33,167
You've all heard of Octa
and their playboy CEO, Owen Case.

289
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:35,813
His partner, Walter Mabry,
died about a year ago.

290
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:37,656
You wanna know what all this
has been leading to?

291
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,726
Yeah.

292
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,163
Octa's hosting the launch
of the next-gen cell phone.

293
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:42,725
Once these phones
hit the streets,

294
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:45,636
they'll siphon their users'
information to the black market.

295
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:49,394
Meaning Octa's selling privacy
to up their profit.

296
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:52,389
So, the Eye has decided
to expose them for it.

297
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:54,545
Our mission
is to hijack the show.

298
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:57,303
Rehearsal's over, guys.

299
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,062
This is what we've
been waiting for.

300
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,582
Now it's time to get to work.

301
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,969
<i>Welcome, Octa insiders,</i>

302
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,696
<i>bloggers and journalists.</i>

303

<i>We're delighted that you've joined us

304
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:19,123

305
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:20,847
<i>Our latest product, Octa 8...</i>

306
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,679
Keys, cell phones,
iPads, in the bin.

307
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:25,641
Thank you, sir.

308
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:30,156
Can't have you texting,
tweeting, recording, or eating.

309
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,916
Sorry, we will take very good
care of it for you.

310
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:35,667
Oh, by the way.

311
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:37,424
Security memo from Case himself.

312
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,979
Couple of surprise guests.
Just follow his lead, yeah?

313
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:42,978
We're all good.
I'm heading to the control room.

314
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:44,543
All right. Thanks, Jack.

315
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:49,009
- Atlas, go.
- No, Dylan, I can't...

316
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,462
- <i>What? What's the problem?</i>
- No, there's too many people...

317
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:53,805
Atlas, I got Owen landing now.

318
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:55,293
Okay, I'm going now.

319
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:57,010
- Stop.
- Oh.

320
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,883
- Okay.
- Thanks.

321
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,242
Pascal, we need you in the kitchen.

322
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,184
Look, the speech is about freedom, okay?

323
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:23,950
That's what we're trying
to sell here, is freedom.

324
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:25,388
Which part of that
do you not understand?

325
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,907
- I know, I'm sorry.
- For goodness sake!

326
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:29,534
Mr. Case, John from legal.
Just need your signature for release.

327
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,256
Thank you so much.

328
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:33,406
Just get it done
and get it back to me.

329
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:42,051
Hey there, buddy! Smile!

330
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,917
- Who are you? What the hell?
- Who am I?

331
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:46,358
It is picture day.
Did Julie not tell you it's picture day?

332
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,245
- Picture day? What are you...
- Company-wide policy.

333
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,043
- Look, I got a job to do.
- I have a job to do, too.

334
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,272
Hold on a second.
What is that?

335
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:52,441
I'm going to need some backup here.

336
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:53,640
Who are you calling?
Hey! That's my ID.

337
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:54,744
Security, my name is...

338
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,357
- Bo Walsh, thank you.
- Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

339
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:57,745
Not this guy.
He's not Bo Walsh.

340
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Calm down, please.

341
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:00,467
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

342
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,111
This guy just came and
put a flashlight in my eyes.

343
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:04,340
I'm trying to do my job.
This guy, check his badge.

344
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,093
- Who is this guy?
- I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

345
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:08,131
It says here,
"Evans Mental Facility.

346
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:09,689
- Mark D. Stooge."
- Hold on a second.

347
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:10,783
I've never seen
this before in my life.

348
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:12,011
I'm sorry, Mr. Walsh.

349
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:13,380
- Come on, Mr. Stooge.
- Hold on. He's not Mr. Walsh!

350
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:15,211
- Come on. Let's go.
- What's going on here?

351
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:17,044
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

352
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,360
God, you cannot trust anybody
in this city anymore, can you?

353
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,250
Get off me!
Look, I want to make a phone call.

354
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:25,208
- I want to call my boss!
- Hey, hey! What's going on?

355
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:27,198
I want to call my boss,
and this jackass...

356
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,244
Hey! Make your phone call.
That's your right, sir.

357
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:31,473
That's my right.

358
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,387
- What the hell?
- You're crazy. Let's go.

359
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:35,112
This isn't my...
Where's my phone?

360
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,865
Where's my phone?

361
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,703
Atlas, Stooge has left
the building.

362
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:40,063
Okay.

363
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,786
The circuit board is ours.
I am leaving backstage.

364
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:47,492
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Case.</i>

365
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,173
All right. Lula, show these guys
what you're made of.

366
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,921
I can take over from here.
Clark says you're on break.

367
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:01,282
What break? Who's Clark?

368
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:03,004
"Who's Clark?" That's funny.

369
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:05,439
Imagine if I told Roger that,
he'd freak out.

370
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,433
- Don't do that!
- What?

371
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,840
Who the hell is Roger?

372
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:10,483
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

373
00:19:10,507 --> 00:19:11,842
- I don't know who Lisa is.
- Are you kidding again?

374
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:13,879
- You don't know who Lisa is now?
- No, I don't. Just get away.

375
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,108
- That is a dangerous...
- You're ruining the meat.

376
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:17,705
Don't make me have to go to Brian!

377
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,354
- I don't know who Brian is!
- Why are you acting like this?

378
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:20,898
- I'll go straight to him.
- Give me...

379
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:23,782
Oh, my God!

380
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,179
<i>What are you
doing to me?</i>

381
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:30,609
- Help me!
- Help her. Go!

382
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,489
Have some water.

383
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:37,285
I feel from your face
you're freaked by the flow of blood,

384
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,008
which is fully fixable in a snap

385
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,602
by focusing and following
the flow of my words

386
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:44,959
as you're flowing and floating,

387
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:47,953
which is why you're focusing
on my commands.

388
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,439
You got this far in life

389
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:52,111
by listening to one voice,
the voice in your head.

390
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,066
This is that voice.

391
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:57,944
Look at the light.

392
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,866
Listen to your own voice.

393
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,696
Oh, my God.

394
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:13,408
Wow. What is that?
Is that a miracle towel?

395
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:15,166
Thank you so much.
Do you know what?

396
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:18,686
You have taught me that I'm not
cut out for this kind of work.

397
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,361
I quit!

398
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:22,159
Get another towel.

399
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:24,601
Thank you, and goodbye.

400
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,639
Oh, God.

401
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:30,993
Welcome everybody!

402
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:33,987
And now, the moment
that you've all been waiting for...

403
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:37,188
- Nice work, lady.
- Thanks.

404
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,306
Revolutionized music with Octa 2.

405
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:44,982
I'm actually nervous,
and I'm not even going onstage.

406
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,257
You know, I've heard
that if you're nervous,

407
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,331
it can be really helpful
to picture each other naked.

408
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:52,169
It's actually picture
the audience naked.

409
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:53,927
No, this is new.
This is a new science.

410
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,333
So, I don't know.

411
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:58,608
- Do you want... We should try it.
- Not the right mood.

412
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,281
Guess that leaves
you and me, old buddy.

413
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:03,164
What? Picture each other...
No. No, thank you.

414
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,198
I mean, I admit,
from the neck up there are issues.

415
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:09,391
But from the neck down, the David.

416
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,911
Owen Case.

417
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:16,388
Good morning, Octa-lites.

418
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,908
Now, I've made the claim...

419
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:21,746
<i>Now, I've made the claim
that Octa 8 is pure magic.</i>

420
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:24,861
But the truth is, that's just
one of those things I say...

421
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:28,331
<i>You know, the truth is,
that's just one of those things I say...</i>

422
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:30,648
...when in fact
I mean something else.

423
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:34,926
<i>...when in fact
I mean something else.</i>

424
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,287
What else do I mean?

425
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:42,636
<i>Well, here to fill you in on some of my
fabulous lies and hypocrisy,</i>

426
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:46,682
<i>and to perform some of the most dazzling
feats of magic you have ever seen...</i>

427
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,354
- They are the world's...
<i>- greatest magicians.</i>

428
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:52,190
<i>Here to expose me
for the fraud I truly am.</i>

429
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:56,585
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the Horsemen.</i>

430
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:12,169
Hello, New York!

431
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:14,172
Thank you so much.

432
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:16,005
Hey, it's great to be back.

433
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:19,366
And have you met
our newest Horseman, Lula?

434
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:26,437
- Feels good, right?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

435
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,636
Thank you, thank you. Um, okay.

436
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:32,469
We want to talk to you
about your privacy.

437
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:34,545
What does your privacy mean to you?

438
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:37,385
Because apparently to Owen Case,
it means absolutely nothing.

439
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,903
No, actually it means less
than absolutely nothing.

440
00:22:40,017 --> 00:22:43,063
You see, he's mocked your privacy.
He's scorned it.

441
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:46,174
Right, and we're not just talking about
the things that you already agreed to

442
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:48,416
when you signed,
probably without reading

443
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:51,694
the terms and conditions
of Octas 1 through 7.

444
00:22:55,402 --> 00:22:58,243
Dylan, the FBI is here.

445
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,637
All right. Don't worry about it.

446
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:02,716
All right, go to plan C-4.

447
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:05,834
Lock the doors.

448
00:23:05,911 --> 00:23:07,514
Hey, boss, I'm glad you're here.

449
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,999
Don't.

450
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:12,196
Guys, look. We got to move
around, get in through the back.

451
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,550
These Horsemen are tricky, okay?

452
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:16,703
They got backup plans
on top of backup plans.

453
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,826
Hey, sorry, don't mean to gloat,
but I told you so.

454
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,103
Cut the bullshit, Rhodes.

455
00:23:20,177 --> 00:23:22,337
We got an anonymous
phone call an hour ago.

456
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:24,097
Confirms everything
I've been telling her.

457
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:25,228
What are you talking about?

458
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:26,626
You sent agents
to Detroit and Philadelphia.

459
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,935
You've been crying wolf
so we wouldn't send them here.

460
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,611
- Boss, please.
- Keep working on the doors.

461
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:35,646
Please tell me that you haven't bought
into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

462
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:37,290
Before we start the show...

463
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,077
We had Owen agree to a few terms
and conditions of our own.

464
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:44,157
So, everything that he had
once considered private...

465
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:48,797
That he thinks is really private...

466
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:52,835
Yeah, everything that he once
considered private is now...

467
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:54,268
Oh, my.

468
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,055
<i>As the Horsemen like to say,
magic is about controlling perception.</i>

469
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:07,180
<i>You see them as champions of the truth,
but are they?</i>

470
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,171
<i>Or is that just another
one of their illusions?</i>

471
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:12,815
- What's going on, Rhodes?
- This is crazy.

472
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,379
We got to get everyone
to the other exits.

473
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:17,006
- Let's go, to the back.
- No. You stay here.

474
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,285
<i>So, since they clearly
love secrets...</i>

475
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,881
<i>Let's reveal some of theirs.</i>

476
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:23,682
Danny, everyone, get off the stage.

477
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,799
<i>Abort.</i>

478
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:28,553
Jack, go with them.
I'll see you at the meet-up point.

479
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:29,628
Let's go.

480
00:24:29,707 --> 00:24:31,833
<i>Do you recall the death of Jack Wilder?</i>

481
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:37,350
<i>What if I told you he's not just alive,
but he's actually right here.</i>

482
00:24:43,893 --> 00:24:47,178
<i>And do you know who else is here?
The FBI.</i>

483
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,455
<i>Let's let them in, shall we?</i>

484
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:52,688
<i>And now, for the big reveal.</i>

485
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:55,413
Go! Go! To the stage.

486
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:57,561
<i>There's a fifth Horseman,</i>

487
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:00,402
<i>and he's the biggest
criminal of them all.</i>

488
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:03,120
<i>FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.</i>

489
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,395
- I knew it.
- What?

490
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:09,549
This is so much deeper
than you know, boss.

491
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:11,801
You think you're looking at one thing,
but you have no idea.

492
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:14,269
- Who are you?
- The same man I've always been.

493
00:25:14,343 --> 00:25:16,105
Boys, I'm sorry.

494
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,460
You gotta be kidding me.

495
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,576
We've gotta get to the chute. Go!

496
00:25:28,648 --> 00:25:31,411
- Who are those guys?
- Who cares? Come on!

497
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:32,690
- Hurry, hurry!
- Keep going!

498
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:33,819
How the hell could this happen?

499
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:35,577
I thought Dylan
had everything under control.

500
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,364
Yeah. Apparently he didn't.

501
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,519
Maybe you're the leak, Dan.
Where you been sneaking off to?

502
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,131
Don't you dare for a second
insinuate that I had...

503
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:45,553
- I'm not insinuating. That's your...
- Let's get to the truck, come on!

504
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:47,791
- Stay together!
- Move! Move!

505
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:48,915
Lula, come on!

506
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:50,909
Coming! Whoa!

507
00:25:53,863 --> 00:25:54,943
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

508
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:03,220
<i>Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.</i>

509
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:15,167
What the hell is going on?

510
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,722
- Wasn't there supposed to be a truck?
- Where the hell are we?

511
00:26:19,797 --> 00:26:21,036
Come on!

512
00:26:21,116 --> 00:26:23,003
Hey, hey!
Wait, did you mis-run the tube?

513
00:26:23,074 --> 00:26:24,722
No, I put it in the truck.
I know I did!

514
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,407
Because we're really
not in the truck right now.

515
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,805
Somebody must
have moved the tube.

516
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:29,364
Were we above a Chinese restaurant?
Give me that!

517
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,985
- I'm moving! Relax!
- There's something very wrong.

518
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,507
Okay. Why are we here?

519
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,546
Why am I frickin' starving?

520
00:26:38,618 --> 00:26:40,744
Yeah, I'm weirdly starving, too.

521
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:43,101
This makes no sense.

522
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,393
Okay, sorry.

523
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:12,032
At least, and I know this
isn't much consolation,

524
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:14,833
but apparently
we're now surrounded by Chinese food.

525
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:17,187
- Right?
- Guys...

526
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,817
I think where we are right now, they
don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

527
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:23,624
It's just called "food."

528
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:30,571
Wait, what are you saying?
How is this possible?

529
00:27:32,964 --> 00:27:38,408
I believe in your particular parlance,
the word is "magic."

530
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:40,996
That guy looks exactly like you.

531
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,122
He looks exactly like you.
Are you seeing this right now?

532
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:45,352
Chase.

533
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:49,398
Must confess, it's like what I heard
about meeting the Rolling Stones.

534
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,388
They're a lot shorter in person.

535
00:27:51,465 --> 00:27:54,307
Remember I told you about the guy
who screwed me out of everything?

536
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,667
This is my twin brother, Chase.

537
00:27:57,819 --> 00:27:59,546
Wait, did you do this?

538
00:28:01,855 --> 00:28:05,651
As you can see,
my boss don't mess around.

539
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:08,413
I do not understand what is
going on right now. At all.

540
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:10,568
Okay, let me break it
down for you.

541
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:14,692
You jumped off a rooftop in New York
and you landed in Macau.

542
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:18,286
AKA the Vegas of China.

543
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:20,677
And presto-changes.

544
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:21,916
Don't you just love it?

545
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:24,075
The "greatest magicians in the world"

546
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:26,630
are the object
of someone else's magic trick?

547
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,870
Isn't that poetic?

548
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:34,546
No? You know what,
I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.

549
00:28:34,622 --> 00:28:37,066
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

550
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:43,136
Oh, and you know what they say,
"What happens in Macau..."

551
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:46,453
Uh, well, I don't know the rest of it,
'cause it's in Chinese, uh...

552
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,258
Hey, thanks, guys!

553
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:10,148
<i>Reports are coming in
that the infamous Horsemen</i>

554
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:12,346
<i>hijacked the Octa product launch today.</i>

555
00:29:12,424 --> 00:29:14,027
<i>The trick was on them, however,</i>

556
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:17,461
<i>as we learned of the miraculous
resurrection of Jack Wilder.</i>

557
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:20,585
<i>And the stunning revelation
that FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes</i>

558
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:23,100
<i>has been working as a mole
within the Bureau.</i>

559
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:26,538
<i>Questions abound today as an
international manhunt is underway</i>

560
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,327
<i>for Dylan Rhodes and his elusive
and criminal band of illusionists.</i>

561
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:34,084
Hey, seriously, where are you guys?

562
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:36,057
I'm at the meetup.
I've been leaving you messages.

563
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:38,399
I haven't heard from anyone.
Please, call me!

564
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:39,693
<i>And the stock market</i>

565
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:42,445
<i>saw big gains and modest
losses on Thursday.</i>

566
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:45,475
Hey, tell me you're safe.
Where are you?

567
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:49,871
Right where you left me,
18 months ago, Agent Rhodes.

568
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:51,107
Thaddeus?

569
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:53,067
<i>How does it feel
to lose everything?</i>

570
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:57,105
Your job. Your identity.
Your reason for living.

571
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,305
How does it feel to be out of control,
perhaps for the first time?

572
00:30:02,774 --> 00:30:03,899
What do you want?

573
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:06,974
You're a fool, Agent Rhodes.
You always have been.

574
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,054
- Where are they?
- I'm not telling you on the phone!

575
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:11,127
Where are they?

576
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:15,206
And if you're wondering if I was behind
the Horsemen's recent debacle,

577
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,044
I'll let you work
that out for yourself.

578
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,121
Hey, I burned you once, I'll burn
you again. I'm not playing, Thaddeus.

579
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:22,879
It's not my game,
Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

580
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,431
You started it when
you locked me in a cell.

581
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:27,193
<i>This is simply my move.</i>

582
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:29,275
Next one is yours.

583
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:33,914
<i>No!</i>

584
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:36,310
Let go!

585
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,583
Dad! Help me! Dad!

586
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:43,337
<i>Dad!</i>

587
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:02,677
It's all about blind spots.

588
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:07,596
When you're staring straight
at something, and not see it. Why?

589
00:31:08,348 --> 00:31:10,031
Blind spots.

590
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:12,345
We learned that together,
didn't we, bro?

591
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:15,265
Did he tell you that
we were partners once?

592
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,501
No? I didn't think so.
The "Mini-McKinneys."

593
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,490
Cool.

594
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:35,171
And then, one day, we were 12
and Virginia von Welsheim

595
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:38,128
had a very nice party
down the street.

596
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:40,517
I had a little tum-tum, couldn't go.

597
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:46,120
Mer-Bear did it on his own, and got
a taste of the solo thing, and uh...

598
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:50,791
- ...and kicked me to the curb.
- Oh, God.

599
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:55,344
Chase, you win! I concede.
Just tell me how you did it.

600
00:31:55,421 --> 00:32:01,582
Delivery guy came to your door
about a month ago, little za.

601
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:02,735
Za?

602
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:05,735
Pizza, huh?

603
00:32:05,851 --> 00:32:10,170
- Is this apartment d3375?
- Not even close.

604
00:32:14,322 --> 00:32:15,766
Sleep!

605
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,399
Relaxing, floating,
drifting, dreaming...

606
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:21,517
Falling.

607
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:24,163
So, what he did,
my little womb-mate,

608
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:28,153
is he downloaded all
your private information,

609
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:31,428
and my employer
had all he needed.

610
00:32:31,505 --> 00:32:32,869
Thanks.

611
00:32:32,944 --> 00:32:35,751
How did you know how to find him?

612
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:39,027
- That's a very good question, Atlas.
- Okay.

613
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,042
Just follow the guards.
They'll take you to my boss.

614
00:33:03,473 --> 00:33:07,190
Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse
with you, broski.

615
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,116
Meow.

616
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:13,263
Have fun at the Sands.

617
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,861
- I am so, so, so sorry.
- Yeah, you should be.

618
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:23,136
Don't ever accuse me
of betraying us again, okay?

619
00:33:35,521 --> 00:33:38,249
Do you guys ever think that
the Eye is watching this?

620
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:40,796
You know, that maybe this
is even what they want?

621
00:33:42,914 --> 00:33:44,516
And at the exact right moment,

622
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:46,831
they're gonna swoop in,
and we'll be like,

623
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,751
"Yes! Thank God you're here!

624
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:51,305
Thank God!
Just in the nick of time, Eye!"

625
00:33:51,385 --> 00:33:55,386
And then we'll just celebrate,
and it was all worth it in the end?

626
00:33:59,577 --> 00:34:01,623
I don't even really
think that, either, so...

627
00:34:01,695 --> 00:34:03,616
It's cool.

628
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,038
Ah.

629
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:20,996
Ta-da!

630
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,714
So happy to be working with you.

631
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,470
Please, come in. Come in.

632
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

633
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,082
Wait, sorry, how are you
working with us?

634
00:34:30,106 --> 00:34:33,027
Oh, well, as much as a magician
who pulls a rabbit from a hat

635
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:35,950
is working with that rabbit.

636
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,578
We'll be working together. Yes.
Allow me to introduce myself.

637
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:42,180
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry.
You died a year ago.

638
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:44,141
Yes. An idea I got
from you, Mr. Wilder.

639
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:46,133
Fake your death,
the world puts its guard down.

640
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,210
I'm able to control
quite a few companies,

641
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:49,812
including my old partner, Owen's,

642
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:53,012
as a consortium of so-called
anonymous shareholders.

643
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:56,801
- And that violates how many SEC laws?
- I believe it breaks all of them.

644
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,243
All of them.

645
00:34:58,318 --> 00:35:01,205
You see, you all want an audience.

646
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:04,719
Need one, desperately.
It's quite sad, really.

647
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,872
Hence, my ability to nab you.

648
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:09,757
I, on the other hand,
want the opposite of that.

649
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:14,225
I just want to be, and I am
100 percent off the grid.

650
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:15,587
You know why?

651
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:18,184
Yeah, because the grid
is for actual human beings.

652
00:35:18,258 --> 00:35:20,577
No, because in a world
of total surveillance,

653
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:23,782
the only true freedom
lies in not being seen.

654
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:26,131
You can't control the grid
from within the grid.

655
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,097
- Follow me.
- Yeah.

656
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,975
- Follow me.
- Okay. All right.

657
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,331
You pulled a hat out of a rabbit.
That was very colorful.

658
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:35,927
Almost eight and a half years ago.
So, no need to bring that up.

659
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,649
We can't all be held accountable
for our adolescent personas.

660
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:40,844
Can we, Magicolio?

661
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:43,234
Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.

662
00:35:43,313 --> 00:35:45,200
Don't get me wrong, I love magic.

663
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:46,476
Like you, and many others who,

664
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,596
I suppose, were not getting any sex
in high school, I dabbled with it.

665
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:55,031
But, uh, unlike you, I was able to
transition upward towards actual magic.

666
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:57,267
Science, you may
have heard it called.

667
00:35:59,777 --> 00:36:04,141
So, would you like to know,
my friends, just how I got you here?

668
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:05,542
We know how you did it.

669
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:06,611
No, you don't.

670
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,418
Yeah, you stole our files for the show,
then obviously hypnotized us.

671
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:10,930
Stop. No. Seriously, stop.

672
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:13,324
The strobe was a combo
of binaural beats, as well as...

673
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:15,768
I said stop!

674
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,318
You might not be having fun,
but I am.

675
00:36:19,117 --> 00:36:21,561
You have an unusual way of showing it.

676
00:36:22,194 --> 00:36:23,194
So...

677
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:25,833
How did I do it?

678
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,468
Easy. You see, magicians like to control
other people's perceptions.

679
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:31,880
In your heightened state of agitation,

680
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:34,269
<i>you saw the simplest cues.
Black tube, roof.</i>

681
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:36,741
<i>And your minds filled in the rest.</i>

682
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,661
<i>But the tube you meant to go down
was 20 feet to your right.</i>

683
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:41,791
Go on, sit down. There's no one
standing in your way.

684
00:36:41,814 --> 00:36:43,303
Don't mind if I do.

685
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:47,331
Anyway, once in the tube,
yes, you're right...

686
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:51,205
<i>Blah, blah, blah, the strobe contained
UV letters pulsing the word "sleep."</i>

687
00:36:53,283 --> 00:36:57,079
<i>And that, combined with the sound,
put you into an instant alpha pattern.</i>

688
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:59,966
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

689
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:01,719
And from then on,
it really was just fun.

690
00:37:01,794 --> 00:37:05,159
And I can assure you,
you don't know what happened.

691
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:12,867
That's really creepy.
Really, really creepy.

692
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,950
That's not cool.

693
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:19,185
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

694
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:21,306
if you put your mind to it.

695
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,375
All right, that's enough.
So why are we here, then?

696
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:26,141
Besides you getting to show off
how adorably clever you are.

697
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,017
Well, to start with,
the man you stole from last year,

698
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:31,887
turns out I had invested quite a lot
of money in some of his companies,

699
00:37:31,924 --> 00:37:35,130
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

700
00:37:35,201 --> 00:37:37,963
Good news is, it's very easy for you
to pay me back.

701
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:40,766
I just need your skills.

702
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:43,723
Owen and I were like the Beatles,
if the Beatles had been...

703
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:44,838
Elfin?

704
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:46,241
...geniuses.

705
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,952
Pretty sure the Beatles were geniuses.

706
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:50,347
And like them, we had a dream.

707
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:54,907
Could we create actual, genuine magic?

708
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,380
And I'm guessing one of you achieved
that dream, and it wasn't you?

709
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,584
That is what he
would like you to think.

710
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:06,735
My vision was a perfect blend
of elegance and technology.

711
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:09,168
But Owen wanted it for himself
so he humiliated me

712
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:12,407
by exposing my private files
to the board of directors

713
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:13,964
and convinced them
that I am unstable.

714
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:16,162
Did you take a picture of him
while he was sleeping?

715
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,655
He had me kicked out of
my own company,

716
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,043
and now he goes around
taking credit for a chip

717
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:21,878
that's not just the key to one computer,

718
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:24,955
but every computer
system on the planet.

719
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:28,111
It can un-encrypt anything,
crack the defense firewall,

720
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:30,950
manipulate markets,
and spy on anyone.

721
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:32,825
And now it's being sold
to the highest bidder.

722
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:34,558
If you're so rich,
why don't you just buy it?

723
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:35,991
So he gets the money?

724
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,260
And the pleasure? No.

725
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:41,578
No, no, no. Besides, why would I buy it
when I could have you steal it for me?

726
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:42,814
Oh!

727
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,907
It's being previewed tomorrow
to the various suitors,

728
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:48,569
which will include your targets,
a crew lead by a South African gangster.

729
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:50,136
South African gangster.

730
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:51,980
Yes. How your team
gets past security, that's up to you.

731
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:55,244
But once you do, you just need
to inspect it and steal it.

732
00:38:55,321 --> 00:38:56,321
That's it?

733
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,207
Come on, this is
perfect for you, isn't it?

734
00:38:58,278 --> 00:38:59,413
You're magicians and thieves.

735
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,040
What makes you think we would even
consider doing this?

736
00:39:02,114 --> 00:39:05,479
Um, oh, wait, I had a reason.
What was it? Oh, yes.

737
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,165
You see, back home,
you're wanted criminals.

738
00:39:07,189 --> 00:39:10,474
But here, I control the police,
the casinos, the media.

739
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:13,751
I can give you a new life,
out of hiding.

740
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:17,225
And if you don't,
I'll have you killed.

741
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,860
You know what?
I'm not stealing a thing for you.

742
00:39:21,974 --> 00:39:26,055
- Not unless Dylan tells me it's okay.
- Really? Dylan is where, exactly?

743
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,017
It doesn't matter. Yeah, I'm with him.
So you can go ahead and kill us

744
00:39:29,087 --> 00:39:31,127
because I'm not gonna
steal anything for you either.

745
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:34,768
Strikes me that a consensus
seems to be forming, Walter,

746
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:36,365
and we're calling your bluff.

747
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:40,124
- Actually, we'll do it.
- What?

748
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:42,958
We're in Macau. The oldest
magic store in the world is here.

749
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:46,398
We'll get the supplies
we need, and we'll do it.

750
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:48,916
Thank you.

751
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,476
It should be fun.

752
00:39:50,546 --> 00:39:53,547
Chase will take you
to the magic shop in the morning.

753
00:39:58,657 --> 00:39:59,657
Badge.

754
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:04,533
Really?

755
00:40:06,649 --> 00:40:08,059
Thanks.

756
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:12,573
Agent Cowan. Your ID.

757
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:14,093
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

758
00:40:18,158 --> 00:40:20,635
It appears Mr. Bradley's
still at dinner.

759
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:23,444
Yeah? Tell him recess is over.

760
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,345
What?

761
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:51,849
All right, so I made my move.

762
00:40:51,924 --> 00:40:54,084
Where are they?
I don't have time for bullshit.

763
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:56,685
Oh, I have all the time
in the world, thanks to you.

764
00:40:56,759 --> 00:41:00,158
And I didn't get to finish my lobster,
which makes me very grumpy.

765
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:02,998
Okay, let's cut the crap.
What do you want?

766
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:06,233
You can dispense with
the tough guy act to begin with.

767
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,873
You're too desperate
for it to be believable.

768
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:13,588
I said, what do you want?

769
00:41:13,662 --> 00:41:17,266
You used a form 219 warrant
to search my room.

770
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:20,021
You found a connection
between me and the Four Horsemen.

771
00:41:20,096 --> 00:41:25,222
Which means you can take me
out of here on a 24-hour leave.

772
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:29,497
- You want me to break you out?
- I want you to take me out.

773
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:32,135
All you need is an extradition order,

774
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:34,932
which you'll find in
that tray by my printer.

775
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,165
Dylan, I had nothing to do
with the Horsemen's disappearance.

776
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:43,712
You were lured into a trap.

777
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,838
And like Dorothy did
when she landed in Oz,

778
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:53,149
you're beginning to realize
that the only way out is through.

779
00:41:53,223 --> 00:41:56,224
And I'm the only one
who can get you there.

780
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,502
You got this place wired.

781
00:41:58,577 --> 00:42:02,703
You don't need me to get out of here.
This is all about payback.

782
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:06,569
- I believe in an eye for an eye.
- So you're out to destroy me?

783
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,854
Oh, absolutely.

784
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:09,223
You think I'm still gonna
play your little game?

785
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:10,929
I know you will.

786
00:42:11,005 --> 00:42:15,006
Because no matter how hard you try
to find a culprit behind all this,

787
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:17,446
you're going to blame only yourself.

788
00:42:17,558 --> 00:42:22,003
When your little vendetta ended with you
putting me in jail 18 months ago,

789
00:42:22,074 --> 00:42:25,961
you got tired, you got sloppy.
You stopped paying attention.

790
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,076
And that's where you lost.

791
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:34,743
So, you can save yourself,

792
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:40,978
or you can make a deal with me,
and save the Four Horsemen,

793
00:42:41,055 --> 00:42:44,340
and stop wasting both of our time.

794
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:51,934
Steal something for this narcissistic
little man boy? I don't like it.

795
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,130
But what I like less
is you deciding for us.

796
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:56,815
Yeah? Do you like that we're the
laughing stocks of the magic world,

797
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,680
and the fugitives
of the actual world?

798
00:42:58,757 --> 00:43:00,484
Walter is right.
We have nowhere to go.

799
00:43:00,555 --> 00:43:01,794
But we can fix that.

800
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:03,079
- We can fix it?
- Yeah.

801
00:43:03,153 --> 00:43:04,727
So you're officially
part of the team now?

802
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:06,558
- Excuse me?
- I'm sure this is what Dylan

803
00:43:06,629 --> 00:43:08,763
meant when he said we should
all work as a single organism.

804
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:12,027
Yeah, that is a fairytale
that Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

805
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:14,752
Look, even if we get this stick,
he'll never let us go.

806
00:43:14,821 --> 00:43:18,902
We can't trust Walter, okay?
The Eye has a history in Macau.

807
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:20,392
They're the only ones we can trust.

808
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:21,470
Now, if we can get it to them,

809
00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:23,779
they can clear our names
and get us the hell out of here.

810
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,381
It's a bad plan, man.

811
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,964
Hey.

812
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:36,326
Hi, how are you?

813
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:38,366
Um, we need some
things custom-made.

814
00:43:38,437 --> 00:43:40,092
Actually, by tomorrow.
We're kind of in a rush.

815
00:43:40,116 --> 00:43:41,798
And...

816
00:43:41,874 --> 00:43:44,079
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

817
00:43:50,026 --> 00:43:53,311
Welcome to long's.
My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

818
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:54,621
- What?
- Got you.

819
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:55,747
- Okay.
- Look.

820
00:43:57,778 --> 00:43:58,778
Where'd it go?

821
00:44:01,414 --> 00:44:03,222
Oh! And now it's by my head. How fun.

822
00:44:03,293 --> 00:44:04,861
- $20.
- $20?

823
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:06,818
No, thank you.
We're kind of in a rush.

824
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:09,128
- $10.
- Uh, no.

825
00:44:09,207 --> 00:44:10,491
- Two for one.
- No.

826
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,180
Okay, all right.
Just give us the thumbs. Yeah?

827
00:44:12,204 --> 00:44:14,442
Okay. Thanks a lot, Jack.
Please take these.

828
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:17,170
So, we need a Keplinger holdout,

829
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:21,240
and we also need roughing fluid,
a Sanada gimmick, sleeves, tracks.

830
00:44:21,315 --> 00:44:23,236
This is all in plastic,
though, if you can.

831
00:44:27,828 --> 00:44:28,828
What?

832
00:44:31,065 --> 00:44:32,588
Is there a problem?

833
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:35,823
My grandmother wants to know
why plastic? Plastic is cheap.

834
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,185
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic
because we're...

835
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:41,815
We're going through a very sensitive
metal detector, okay?

836
00:44:41,934 --> 00:44:44,616
So plastic, nothing. Metal...

837
00:44:46,729 --> 00:44:48,775
It detects.

838
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:54,328
What did she say?

839
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:57,766
She said just because you're
talking slowly and moving your hands

840
00:44:57,838 --> 00:44:59,838
doesn't mean she can suddenly
understand English.

841
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:02,678
Oh, yeah. So sorry. He's racist.

842
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:06,959
Hey, bro. Listen, I know
that the only thing that we agree on

843
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:09,632
is that our mom and dad
had one too many children.

844
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:13,991
So why don't we just let
the kids play with their toys

845
00:45:14,062 --> 00:45:15,550
and go get a little drinkey-poo?

846
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:20,985
- If it's free, it's me.
- Great. Guys, we'll be right back.

847
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:24,658
Okay, kiddies,
the chaperones are watching you.

848
00:45:24,731 --> 00:45:27,016
Don't do anything I wouldn't enjoy.

849
00:45:28,088 --> 00:45:30,134
Okay. Have fun, you two.

850
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:35,927
Hey. Can I use your phone?
It's kind of important.

851
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,363
Sure.

852
00:45:38,198 --> 00:45:39,846
- On the house.
- Thanks.

853
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:42,594
Who are you calling?

854
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,168
I'm arranging
to hand over the stick.

855
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:45,954
So that's how we've been
contacting the Eye?

856
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,314
You've been doing it
on your own?

857
00:45:47,388 --> 00:45:48,513
Maybe.

858
00:45:48,587 --> 00:45:50,986
Oh, God.
Dylan's not gonna like this.

859
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:53,145
I'm not really concerned
with what Dylan likes. Okay?

860
00:45:53,223 --> 00:45:54,461
I'm doing this for us.

861
00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:00,381
- What is wrong with this thing?
- Hey, relax, it's just a kid's toy.

862
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:01,785
Yeah, that's what I thought.

863
00:46:01,854 --> 00:46:03,218
- Okay. Let me just...
- Ow!

864
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,657
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

865
00:46:07,688 --> 00:46:10,132
Hey, can you get this?

866
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:16,687
It's like birth, you know.

867
00:46:16,759 --> 00:46:20,203
One person enters the hospital,
two people come out.

868
00:46:20,275 --> 00:46:21,719
Walk and talk.

869
00:46:21,794 --> 00:46:24,113
I'll tell you on the plane.

870
00:46:24,192 --> 00:46:26,317
What plane?

871
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:29,356
My sources tell me
your Horsemen are in Macau.

872
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:32,390
- What's the look?
- It's none of your business.

873
00:46:32,463 --> 00:46:33,668
Who are your sources?

874
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:38,419
Just some old friends.

875
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,251
When we have the card, where do I go?

876
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:50,726
And 0 for 52.

877
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:53,851
Well, it's perfect.
It's a perfect score.

878
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:57,762
Then what about girls?

879
00:46:57,838 --> 00:46:59,679
Like, relationships?

880
00:46:59,756 --> 00:47:00,881
What?

881
00:47:04,751 --> 00:47:08,308
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

882
00:47:08,387 --> 00:47:14,423
but every girl I get close to,
I end up taking their trust.

883
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,979
And then their wallet.

884
00:47:17,578 --> 00:47:18,703
So...

885
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:23,698
- You take their wallets?
- Yeah.

886
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,056
You ever take their belts?

887
00:47:29,486 --> 00:47:33,931
Or how about some peanuts
from the hotel bar?

888
00:47:34,002 --> 00:47:36,969
Not sure why you took those.

889
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,119
I'm sorry, did you think
that I was like those other girls?

890
00:47:41,674 --> 00:47:43,481
Oh, Jack.

891
00:47:49,186 --> 00:47:51,391
Okay. So there's a marketplace
down the street.

892
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:53,590
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

893
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,390
He'll get the stick to the right people
and get us home.

894
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:58,505
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

895
00:47:58,577 --> 00:48:00,304
And, hey, put your belt on.

896
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:03,058
Oh, no, it's not...
She took it off me and...

897
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:07,132
You know, the most
heartbreaking moment of my life

898
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:11,926
was when I discovered that you had
stolen all my money and split.

899
00:48:12,004 --> 00:48:14,084
I didn't realize until now

900
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:16,639
how much of that money
you put into your face.

901
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,276
Seriously, is it weird to have more hair
in your nose than on your head?

902
00:48:21,354 --> 00:48:23,923
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

903
00:48:23,992 --> 00:48:29,629
you might wanna consider requesting
something other than old man pubes.

904
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:33,752
You know what?
You are such a buffoon, Mer-Bear.

905
00:48:33,822 --> 00:48:35,743
And this little ploy you have

906
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,901
of stalling me while your friends
screw over my employer?

907
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:41,618
Not gonna work.

908
00:48:44,012 --> 00:48:48,217
Chase! As you stare into my eyes,
you will find that you wanna sleep.

909
00:48:48,287 --> 00:48:50,936
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

910
00:48:51,005 --> 00:48:54,164
and realize that you will never be
half the man that he is.

911
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:02,883
Merritt, I am so,
so very, very sorry

912
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:05,681
about how pathetic your pupil is.

913
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,910
Hey, a little hint
on your technique of surprise.

914
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:13,306
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

915
00:49:13,822 --> 00:49:18,186
Hey, this has been fun, Mer-Bear.
Let's do it again sometime.

916
00:49:21,614 --> 00:49:26,536
Well, I've had ample time
to do some research, and you know,

917
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:27,655
I was wrong.

918
00:49:27,728 --> 00:49:31,331
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

919
00:49:31,404 --> 00:49:32,893
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

920
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:34,963
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

921
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,359
that this road would lead to
the great wizard behind the curtain

922
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:41,006
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

923
00:49:41,074 --> 00:49:42,279
That ain't gonna happen.

924
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:43,968
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it?

925
00:49:43,992 --> 00:49:46,725
Listen to me. I broke you out of there.
We're not changing the terms now.

926
00:49:46,749 --> 00:49:49,477
- You put me there!
- Yeah, because you deserve to be there.

927
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:53,069
- Listen, I did not kill your father.
- What?

928
00:49:53,182 --> 00:49:56,103
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

929
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:59,737
I know who you are, Shrike.

930
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:03,094
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

931
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:07,139
I know you think I goaded him into
performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

932
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:12,050
I know the time in jail was a result
of a 30-year revenge plot against me.

933
00:50:12,123 --> 00:50:14,328
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

934
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:15,606
Man...

935
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:18,967
Thirty years.

936
00:50:19,036 --> 00:50:24,640
Thirty years, and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

937
00:50:24,711 --> 00:50:28,507
Just to put me behind bars. Okay.

938
00:50:30,065 --> 00:50:31,953
So how did it feel, seeing me there?

939
00:50:32,982 --> 00:50:34,745
Was it all you hoped?

940
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:36,315
I don't know what you're talking about.

941
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:40,420
You're lying.
It was an empty experience.

942
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,541
And you wanna know how I know?

943
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:46,340
I know because you know.

944
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:52,251
There's always, always more
than what's on the surface.

945
00:50:52,323 --> 00:50:54,777
So what, the past didn't happen,
and you're not who I think you are?

946
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,975
Now, don't tell me in 30 years

947
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:58,841
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

948
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:02,835
I am not my father.
You're not getting in my head, okay?

949
00:51:02,913 --> 00:51:05,436
You think you're luring me into a trap?
You're not.

950
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,113
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

951
00:51:08,187 --> 00:51:11,666
My only concern is the health
and well-being of the Horsemen.

952
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:15,222
And you're gonna lead me to them.
And if you don't, I promise you,

953
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,187
you're gonna end up far worse
than in some cushy jail cell somewhere.

954
00:51:32,563 --> 00:51:36,166
What if the Horsemen
don't actually need you to save them?

955
00:51:40,715 --> 00:51:43,522
All right. So the lab
is made up of two distinct layers,

956
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:46,638
the security perimeter
and the clean room.

957
00:51:46,709 --> 00:51:48,709
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

958
00:51:48,787 --> 00:51:50,833
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

959
00:51:50,904 --> 00:51:52,632
and replace it with a decoy.

960
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,117
Now, we're about to get to the chip.

961
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:55,756
This is the thing
about the chip, it's very thin.

962
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,667
Luckily, it's similar
in weight and size to a playing card,

963
00:51:58,737 --> 00:52:00,697
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

964
00:52:02,693 --> 00:52:03,739
Whoa, whoa!

965
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,327
That's no good.

966
00:52:18,837 --> 00:52:21,041
So how do we get in?
Hannes Pike.

967
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:22,921
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

968
00:52:22,992 --> 00:52:24,675
<i>He's RSVP'd with what looks like</i>

969
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:26,717
<i>a couple of members
of his security detail.</i>

970
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:29,790
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,
and somebody named Buffy.</i>

971
00:52:29,865 --> 00:52:33,548
<i>Yeah, apparently, he travels
with a different bimbo every week. Hmm.</i>

972
00:52:33,622 --> 00:52:36,270
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

973
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,692
Hey, can I get in?

974
00:52:48,407 --> 00:52:49,975
At the soothing sound of the slots

975
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:53,410
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

976
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,444
<i>Jack, for a moment,</i>

977
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,241
<i>They will think you're Hannes,
so lead them out and keep them busy.</i>

978
00:52:59,316 --> 00:53:01,521
You trust your people implicitly.

979
00:53:01,594 --> 00:53:03,640
You will have them
take care of everything,

980
00:53:03,712 --> 00:53:05,121
and you will wait in the car.

981
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:08,748
And eyes open, wide awake. Go.

982
00:53:08,826 --> 00:53:10,681
Excuse me.
These people are following me.

983
00:53:10,705 --> 00:53:12,105
You might wanna
check their pockets.

984
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:18,338
<i>Then our time is
ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

985
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:20,551
<i>and get the card to the market,
where I'll hand it off to the Eye,</i>

986
00:53:20,575 --> 00:53:22,098
<i>so we can all get the hell home.</i>

987
00:53:41,114 --> 00:53:44,399
Hannes, my old friend.
So glad you could make it.

988
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,551
I knew you had a soft spot
for an old-school bidding war.

989
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:48,708
How have you been?

990
00:53:48,786 --> 00:53:52,424
I trust my people implicitly.
What they say goes.

991
00:53:52,503 --> 00:53:55,583
Certainly. But I'm sure
you'd like to see it for yourself.

992
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,467
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

993
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:03,458
Or not. Also fine.

994
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,532
Well, if you'd like to follow me.

995
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:13,445
You'll have to remove all your metal.
Watches, rings, etc.

996
00:54:13,522 --> 00:54:15,886
- Yeah, of course.
- Excuse me for asking...

997
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:17,800
Where might I have seen you before?

998
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:21,560
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

999
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:22,714
The book jacket!

1000
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,634
I have to say, Dr. Michaelakis,
I'm a huge fan.

1001
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,551
Oh, thank you so much.

1002
00:54:27,628 --> 00:54:30,105
Uh, which book?
There have been so many...

1003
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:33,992
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

1004
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:36,819
Doctor?

1005
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:43,293
Sorry, when you say "chippy,"
you are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

1006
00:54:43,372 --> 00:54:44,532
Of course.

1007
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:50,853
Hannes prefers the term "floozy"
for all his boy toys.

1008
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:53,970
- Yeah. He does. That's good.
- Noted.

1009
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,087
By the way,
I got your email, Dr. Michaelakis.

1010
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,683
You had a query about our ability

1011
00:54:57,757 --> 00:54:59,837
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1012
00:54:59,915 --> 00:55:04,473
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators, or error correction.

1013
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,153
Do you care to elucidate?

1014
00:55:06,229 --> 00:55:07,593
- Right.
- Yeah.

1015
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:09,634
Yes, I did send that email.

1016
00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:12,673
- The other day, I saw you.
- I did, I sent it. So what gives?

1017
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,186
I'm sorry, what gives...

1018
00:55:14,261 --> 00:55:15,784
I think what she's trying to say...

1019
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:17,873
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

1020
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,182
Okay.

1021
00:55:19,256 --> 00:55:20,495
If you'll hold on to that.

1022
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,302
- Yeah, sure, Doctor.
- Thank you.

1023
00:55:22,373 --> 00:55:24,850
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

1024
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,976
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

1025
00:55:27,048 --> 00:55:30,765
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder." Disorder!

1026
00:55:30,844 --> 00:55:35,448
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

1027
00:55:41,114 --> 00:55:44,274
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

1028
00:55:44,391 --> 00:55:47,437
The emergence of quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

1029
00:55:47,508 --> 00:55:50,395
So that is, in fact, what gives.

1030
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,500
Thank you.

1031
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:07,098
You know,
Buffy is not a bad name for you.

1032
00:56:07,168 --> 00:56:10,771
You know, buff, firm, taut.

1033
00:56:10,844 --> 00:56:12,698
That's good.
Did you just find a thesaurus somewhere?

1034
00:56:12,722 --> 00:56:14,007
Nubile.

1035
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:17,207
- That's good. Thank you. Okay.
- There we go.

1036
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:29,190
Sorry, sorry.

1037
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,498
The stick's metal.
How are we going to get it out?

1038
00:56:38,577 --> 00:56:39,781
Yeah. I don't know.

1039
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:42,776
This is the housing.

1040
00:56:42,852 --> 00:56:47,410
820 million qubit miles
of digi-synaptic resonance.

1041
00:56:52,802 --> 00:56:55,256
But of course, what sets us apart
from anything else on the planet

1042
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,997
is the processor, which we playfully
refer to as the Magic Broomstick.

1043
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:01,075
The Broomstick?

1044
00:57:01,154 --> 00:57:04,871
Has the power to clear the contents
of any computing system on the planet

1045
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,598
and then magically
sweep them into your bin.

1046
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:10,316
Oh! Broomstick. That's funny.

1047
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,147
Take a look, vet it however you'd like,

1048
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,541
and tell Hannes we'll be
taking bids on Monday.

1049
00:57:15,619 --> 00:57:16,824
Thank you.

1050
00:57:18,896 --> 00:57:21,578
Oh, my God.
I must be allergic to something in here.

1051
00:57:21,653 --> 00:57:23,574
What could you possibly be
allergic to in here?

1052
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:26,857
- This room is hermetically sealed.
- That's it.

1053
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:28,769
I'm allergic to hermetic seals.

1054
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:30,580
If we could get him away
from the computer, please.

1055
00:57:30,604 --> 00:57:33,287
- That's the one thing.
- Just until he's recovered.

1056
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:34,930
We're gonna need some anti-bac...

1057
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,841
Do we have alcohol wipes?

1058
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:40,291
Your hands need to be sterile
if you intend to get any closer.

1059
00:57:40,315 --> 00:57:42,520
Do I make myself clear?

1060
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,998
- Sorry. We couldn't...
- No, I'm fine.

1061
00:57:47,068 --> 00:57:48,363
...take his medicine into the country.

1062
00:57:48,387 --> 00:57:49,546
Yeah...

1063
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:55,386
Can't risk any contamination.

1064
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,222
You're gonna have to stay away
from the inner workings.

1065
00:57:58,297 --> 00:57:59,660
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1066
00:57:59,735 --> 00:58:01,390
- All right. If you're done...
- Oh. Here you go.

1067
00:58:01,414 --> 00:58:03,141
Sorry about this.
Okay. I'm okay.

1068
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:05,338
This happens to him sometimes.
It'll pass.

1069
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:07,297
Allergies. Nothing you can do.

1070
00:58:07,368 --> 00:58:09,725
Well, something you could do, Doctor.

1071
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:30,426
Okay?

1072
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:38,458
Search him, please.

1073
00:58:38,536 --> 00:58:39,980
Didn't we just do that?

1074
00:58:40,055 --> 00:58:41,385
Are you serious?

1075
00:58:41,454 --> 00:58:43,420
Okay. I wanna run
full diagnostics on the system.

1076
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:47,217
This is completely unnecessary.

1077
00:59:16,738 --> 00:59:17,943
Up, up,

1078
00:59:18,057 --> 00:59:19,182
Okay.

1079
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:39,244
Ah!

1080
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:41,714
Hey! I can walk on my own.

1081
00:59:49,306 --> 00:59:50,874
Whoa!

1082
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:53,542
Sorry.

1083
01:00:11,284 --> 01:00:12,364
Hey!

1084
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,330
I can do that myself.

1085
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,685
We just met, man.

1086
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:18,122
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1087
01:00:30,345 --> 01:00:31,345
Hey!

1088
01:00:32,502 --> 01:00:34,980
My eyes are up here, man.

1089
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,509
How do you like it?

1090
01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:00,116
Hey, I'm good.

1091
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:02,833
Turn around.

1092
01:01:20,974 --> 01:01:22,213
Do you have anything?

1093
01:01:22,293 --> 01:01:23,975
I don't know.
Can't trust anybody.

1094
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:27,688
- I'm good.
- They're clean.

1095
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:31,087
Do your final checks
and get them out of here.

1096
01:01:31,164 --> 01:01:33,482
Oh, we're walking
this way again. Yay.

1097
01:01:38,996 --> 01:01:42,599
I don't speak the language.

1098
01:01:48,986 --> 01:01:50,395
See?

1099
01:01:50,464 --> 01:01:52,424
What did I tell you, man?
We didn't have anything.

1100
01:01:53,341 --> 01:01:55,865
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1101
01:02:11,803 --> 01:02:15,520
Something about a big white dance floor,
makes me wanna boogie.

1102
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:17,878
Hey, thanks for having us.

1103
01:02:18,436 --> 01:02:20,357
That's great stuff.

1104
01:02:26,468 --> 01:02:27,707
Okay.

1105
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:30,264
You guys are pretty serious
about your security, huh?

1106
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:35,303
Okay.

1107
01:02:35,379 --> 01:02:38,823
Do I have all my things?
I feel like I came in with more stuff.

1108
01:02:38,896 --> 01:02:41,544
Did I come in with more stuff?

1109
01:02:41,613 --> 01:02:43,773
You don't think so?

1110
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:48,492
Uh, sir, I think you
still have my wallet.

1111
01:02:48,566 --> 01:02:51,215
Remember, I, uh, gave it
to you when I came in?

1112
01:02:51,283 --> 01:02:53,443
It would be nice to leave with it.

1113
01:02:58,276 --> 01:02:59,276
Wallet coming through.

1114
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:08,750
Sorry, my belt.

1115
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,984
Uh...

1116
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:18,065
I guess that's everything, right?

1117
01:03:18,137 --> 01:03:19,216
Thank you.

1118
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,819
- That is not a toy, Buffy.
- Sorry.

1119
01:03:27,048 --> 01:03:28,616
Go, go, go!

1120
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,001
All right.
Drop me off at the market

1121
01:03:37,078 --> 01:03:38,840
so I can get this to the Eye.

1122
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,171
You asked me to call you
when they started

1123
01:03:40,194 --> 01:03:42,274
running around like headless chickens.

1124
01:03:43,311 --> 01:03:44,721
Well, that's what's happening.

1125
01:03:59,495 --> 01:04:02,144
This is where your sources
told you they'd be?

1126
01:04:02,212 --> 01:04:06,009
No, this is where my sources said
we might find an answer.

1127
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:18,920
She must be familiar with your work.

1128
01:04:18,996 --> 01:04:20,405
Excuse me.

1129
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:23,674
Miss, have you seen these people?

1130
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,745
She says her grandson
spoke to their leader.

1131
01:04:36,818 --> 01:04:38,023
He's in the back.

1132
01:04:38,656 --> 01:04:39,861
What?

1133
01:04:39,975 --> 01:04:41,816
No "Wow, you speak Mandarin"?

1134
01:05:13,461 --> 01:05:15,621
Ah! The Coffin to the Beyond.

1135
01:05:17,097 --> 01:05:21,621
It was always a flap,
or a trap or mirrors.

1136
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:26,250
The audience thought
he'd just disappeared.

1137
01:05:27,287 --> 01:05:30,208
But he was always
hidden somewhere inside.

1138
01:05:41,873 --> 01:05:46,590
I believe that's the prototype
for the one your father had made.

1139
01:05:46,668 --> 01:05:49,987
He, like many others over the years,
ordered his supplies from here.

1140
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:53,910
Ah!
Of course.

1141
01:05:53,981 --> 01:05:57,698
That's why you gave me the look
when I said they were in Macau.

1142
01:05:57,777 --> 01:05:59,982
Your father used to come here
when you were young.

1143
01:06:00,054 --> 01:06:01,782
Can I please get some space here?

1144
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:11,053
If you think you're the only one who'd
wondered for 30 years what happened...

1145
01:06:11,483 --> 01:06:13,131
...you're not.

1146
01:06:13,201 --> 01:06:15,520
Lionel was a master magician.

1147
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,127
Either he gamed the hinges,

1148
01:06:17,197 --> 01:06:20,721
so he could kick the door
and they would pop out,

1149
01:06:20,794 --> 01:06:24,636
or he had access to the lock
from the inside so he could pick it.

1150
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:29,393
Word is the safe was made
from cheap metal, and it bowed.

1151
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:35,102
Still, he always had
something up his sleeve.

1152
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:41,783
Unless he'd reached the limit of
his capabilities and his clock ran out.

1153
01:06:46,568 --> 01:06:51,091
Excuse me. My grandmother
has something you might want.

1154
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,078
This was your father's.

1155
01:06:57,157 --> 01:06:59,362
He had several of these made.

1156
01:07:18,736 --> 01:07:20,384
And the Horsemen?

1157
01:07:21,293 --> 01:07:23,419
I overheard them talking.

1158
01:07:23,491 --> 01:07:27,969
One of them, Atlas, he's meeting
someone at the market nearby.

1159
01:07:45,189 --> 01:07:46,792
As for former Agent Rhodes,

1160
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:49,471
his location is now
your number one priority.

1161
01:07:49,545 --> 01:07:51,705
We're putting out an international APB.

1162
01:07:51,783 --> 01:07:54,545
We have Interpol, including cooperation
from local authorities.

1163
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,859
Agent Cowan.

1164
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:59,542
I'm assuming it was actually not you
who walked into Newburgh Federal Prison,

1165
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,536
then walked out 30 minutes later
with Thaddeus Bradley?

1166
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:04,533
- What?
- He used your ID.

1167
01:08:08,606 --> 01:08:10,572
What are you doing, Rhodes?

1168
01:08:38,016 --> 01:08:40,062
- Atlas, hey.
- Dylan.

1169
01:08:40,134 --> 01:08:41,709
- I blew it, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

1170
01:08:41,733 --> 01:08:42,971
I'm here to help now.

1171
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:44,386
Okay, we definitely
don't need your help.

1172
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,695
I know I messed up, all right?

1173
01:08:45,769 --> 01:08:47,343
Yeah, you put everybody's
lives in danger.

1174
01:08:47,367 --> 01:08:49,732
- Where is everybody?
- Where is everybody?

1175
01:08:49,805 --> 01:08:51,499
I can't be seen with you,
actually, right now.

1176
01:08:51,523 --> 01:08:53,489
I got it now, okay?
I appreciate you taking

1177
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:55,175
the time to take control
for a little while.

1178
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:56,933
- Hey, I'm actually... Yeah?
- Yeah, but I got it now, all right?

1179
01:08:56,957 --> 01:08:58,003
- You do?
- Yeah.

1180
01:08:58,076 --> 01:08:59,491
You look like you can
get some rest, buddy.

1181
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,992
- Who you meeting here?
- I'm not meeting anybody.

1182
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:03,607
They told me at long's
you were meeting somebody.

1183
01:09:03,631 --> 01:09:05,552
At long's?

1184
01:09:05,629 --> 01:09:08,436
Okay, yeah, no, I am, um...

1185
01:09:08,506 --> 01:09:10,904
I'm meeting somebody from the Eye.

1186
01:09:10,983 --> 01:09:12,263
Yeah, no, they agreed to meet me

1187
01:09:12,302 --> 01:09:15,303
to exchange this computer chip
for our lives back.

1188
01:09:15,379 --> 01:09:16,659
So that's what it's come to now.

1189
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:18,552
I hope you're happy
with the situation you've put us in.

1190
01:09:18,576 --> 01:09:20,099
You're talking to the Eye?

1191
01:09:20,174 --> 01:09:21,254
Yeah.

1192
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:23,174
Why are you talking to the Eye?

1193
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:27,137
Atlas.
Atlas, give me the stick.

1194
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:29,492
Dylan, you're not our
leader anymore, okay?

1195
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:32,213
You're not our hero.
You're not FBI.

1196
01:09:32,282 --> 01:09:35,249
You're not a magician.
You're not really anything.

1197
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:38,160
And we trusted you for a year.

1198
01:09:38,236 --> 01:09:40,690
So if you really wanna help us...
If you really...

1199
01:09:40,714 --> 01:09:43,317
If you really wanna help us,
you would leave.

1200
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:55,027
I get it. Cool. Bye.

1201
01:10:12,682 --> 01:10:13,886
Hello, hello!

1202
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,768
Yeah, that was me you called
at the magic shop.

1203
01:10:17,237 --> 01:10:20,204
So much fun though, knowing you'd be
scurrying away from me at the lab

1204
01:10:20,274 --> 01:10:21,718
just to bring it to me here.

1205
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:23,441
Did you actually think I'd let you go?

1206
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,193
- How did you do that?
- Everyone has their button.

1207
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:30,269
You push it and they go blind.
And yours, obviously, is ego.

1208
01:10:30,344 --> 01:10:31,832
"Stay the course.

1209
01:10:31,902 --> 01:10:34,665
<i>Great changes are in store.</i>

1210
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,263
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

1211
01:10:37,337 --> 01:10:38,905
will not go unrecognized."

1212
01:10:40,174 --> 01:10:41,618
- That was you.
- Yeah.

1213
01:10:41,693 --> 01:10:43,216
Merritt downloaded all the files,

1214
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:46,019
but how do you think
we were able to find him?

1215
01:10:46,088 --> 01:10:47,168
Your phone.

1216
01:10:49,085 --> 01:10:51,051
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

1217
01:10:51,123 --> 01:10:54,283
What you actually put your phone on
was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1218
01:10:55,798 --> 01:11:00,004
Once again,
science beats magic.

1219
01:11:00,474 --> 01:11:02,758
- So, the stick?
- No.

1220
01:11:05,868 --> 01:11:06,868
I got it!

1221
01:11:06,947 --> 01:11:08,391
I got it. I got it.

1222
01:11:10,424 --> 01:11:12,311
- Fuck, Dylan!
- Wait, leave them!

1223
01:11:12,382 --> 01:11:13,876
You really think
I'm gonna walk away from you?

1224
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,980
Give me the stick!

1225
01:11:16,098 --> 01:11:17,178
Give me it!

1226
01:11:17,257 --> 01:11:20,224
All right.
Don't ever question me again. Beat it!

1227
01:11:31,043 --> 01:11:33,521
- So, the stick.
- Go to hell.

1228
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,360
Boys.

1229
01:11:47,826 --> 01:11:49,747
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1230
01:12:06,048 --> 01:12:07,458
There's like 10 of you.

1231
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:09,334
Come on, he's just doing tricks.

1232
01:12:09,405 --> 01:12:11,292
He's there! Go!

1233
01:12:59,914 --> 01:13:00,994
Oh...

1234
01:13:34,759 --> 01:13:39,556
Dylan, watch the pretty birdies fly.
And sleep.

1235
01:13:39,914 --> 01:13:43,199
- Doesn't work on me.
- Not even as a distraction?

1236
01:13:45,908 --> 01:13:48,512
- Good job.
- Nice to be involved.

1237
01:13:56,777 --> 01:13:58,823
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1238
01:13:58,895 --> 01:14:01,588
- I just saw Dylan, something happened.
- What do you mean you just saw Dylan?

1239
01:14:01,612 --> 01:14:03,658
Dylan's here?
What happened?

1240
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,208
- Atlas.
- I don't know.

1241
01:14:11,043 --> 01:14:12,203
What are they doing?

1242
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:14,725
Those are Walter's men.

1243
01:14:14,799 --> 01:14:17,845
This is what they want.

1244
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:20,121
What the hell?
How do you still have that?

1245
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:26,876
Whoa. That's Lionel Shrike's safe.

1246
01:14:26,947 --> 01:14:29,471
What the hell
do they want with that?

1247
01:14:29,544 --> 01:14:31,307
Okay, we gotta
follow that truck.

1248
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:34,701
They must have Dylan.
We don't have much time.

1249
01:14:39,095 --> 01:14:40,334
What do you want?

1250
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:45,051
You to understand something
very important.

1251
01:14:45,129 --> 01:14:48,369
We are mirror images.

1252
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:49,775
You see, because like you,

1253
01:14:49,844 --> 01:14:52,083
I share a very deep connection
with my father.

1254
01:14:53,441 --> 01:14:58,397
And like you, I'll stop at nothing
to avenge any wrongs done to him.

1255
01:15:03,071 --> 01:15:06,628
You know the only difference
between your father and mine?

1256
01:15:06,707 --> 01:15:08,594
Mine's still alive.

1257
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:10,509
Get him up.

1258
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:28,330
So, this is the man

1259
01:15:28,406 --> 01:15:31,485
who spent a lifetime
plotting against me.

1260
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,799
I wouldn't have known your face

1261
01:15:35,878 --> 01:15:39,357
if it had been on a billboard
outside my bedroom window.

1262
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:43,117
But you have spent, what,
30 years thinking about mine?

1263
01:15:43,191 --> 01:15:44,475
When my father died,

1264
01:15:44,549 --> 01:15:46,675
your insurance company
denied my mother her claims.

1265
01:15:46,747 --> 01:15:48,122
- I wouldn't even have known...
- She died a pauper!

1266
01:15:48,146 --> 01:15:49,987
...who your mother was.

1267
01:15:50,064 --> 01:15:54,667
She was a digit, a nanobyte
in a stream of data.

1268
01:15:54,739 --> 01:15:56,705
Because nothing is personal to you

1269
01:15:56,777 --> 01:15:59,111
and everyone and everything
is just a number, isn't that so?

1270
01:15:59,135 --> 01:16:01,738
That is where you are wrong,
Mr. Rhodes.

1271
01:16:01,812 --> 01:16:06,734
Once you made yourself known
it became very personal.

1272
01:16:08,006 --> 01:16:09,847
- My son...
- Yeah, the sociopath.

1273
01:16:09,924 --> 01:16:14,481
Funny thing is, I have seven
so-called legitimate children.

1274
01:16:14,559 --> 01:16:17,605
Sniveling, snobbish, stupid runts.

1275
01:16:17,676 --> 01:16:21,643
I have one illegitimate child
who is a lot like me.

1276
01:16:21,712 --> 01:16:24,077
The point is,
he wants something,

1277
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:29,311
and like any good parent, I will
stop at nothing to get it for him.

1278
01:16:29,385 --> 01:16:31,112
Your Horsemen have it.

1279
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:35,507
You will turn it and them
over to us, now.

1280
01:16:35,578 --> 01:16:36,658
No.

1281
01:16:40,413 --> 01:16:43,176
Dylan, I would like you
to really take this moment in

1282
01:16:43,251 --> 01:16:46,649
because this is the consequence
of your personal vendetta come to life

1283
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:48,489
and staring you in the face.

1284
01:16:48,565 --> 01:16:50,328
I want you to know
that when you're gone,

1285
01:16:50,403 --> 01:16:51,449
we're not going to stop.

1286
01:16:51,522 --> 01:16:53,648
We're gonna destroy
everything you believe in,

1287
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,925
starting with the Horsemen,
and ending with the Eye.

1288
01:16:55,998 --> 01:16:57,885
Now then, cast your mind back

1289
01:16:57,956 --> 01:17:01,082
to standing by the banks of the river
watching your father descend,

1290
01:17:01,153 --> 01:17:03,153
disgraced and discredited.

1291
01:17:03,231 --> 01:17:05,993
The horrid psychic pain
as you have relived for years.

1292
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:10,032
I felt that same thing two years ago

1293
01:17:10,104 --> 01:17:13,230
as you drained not just my father's
fortune, but his dignity!

1294
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:15,780
And yet you took pleasure from it.

1295
01:17:18,615 --> 01:17:21,219
This should bring back
some childhood memories.

1296
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:50,426
- Would you like some tea?
- Oh. Thank you.

1297
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:08,412
- You ready?
- Over to you.

1298
01:18:15,398 --> 01:18:16,444
Splash!

1299
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:21,357
Job done!

1300
01:18:36,977 --> 01:18:40,375
Hell is going to
seem like a day at the spa

1301
01:18:40,453 --> 01:18:42,931
by the time we're through
with these Horsemen.

1302
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:45,659
- Wouldn't you say?
- You had me at "hell."

1303
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:04,916
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1304
01:19:07,506 --> 01:19:09,905
Always keep something up my sleeve.

1305
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:31,671
I wish I could dredge
from the muck of my soul

1306
01:20:31,742 --> 01:20:35,823
one speck of remorse,
but I can't.

1307
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:42,342
So I'll stick to the business at hand
and try not to smile too broadly.

1308
01:20:42,411 --> 01:20:47,731
And, uh, thank you for delivering
Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

1309
01:20:48,525 --> 01:20:50,252
I take it it's done.

1310
01:20:51,562 --> 01:20:53,528
Literally hit the bottom.

1311
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:59,883
- Now, where are the Horsemen?
- They're performers.

1312
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:05,512
Their pride, their ego, their need
to be adored are all too powerful

1313
01:21:05,588 --> 01:21:07,475
to keep them out of
the limelight for long.

1314
01:21:07,546 --> 01:21:13,025
If they don't make themselves known,
you will find yourself

1315
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:17,108
in a very similar position
to Mr. Rhodes.

1316
01:21:17,176 --> 01:21:21,019
- Are we clear about that?
- As clear as the water he's under.

1317
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:32,043
You'll have the rest
when I have the Horsemen.

1318
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:05,335
Dylan!

1319
01:22:06,807 --> 01:22:09,125
Dylan, come on, buddy, breathe!

1320
01:22:09,204 --> 01:22:10,409
- Dylan.
- Dylan?

1321
01:22:10,483 --> 01:22:12,563
Dylan, come on!

1322
01:22:16,837 --> 01:22:19,565
You're okay.

1323
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:22,316
Jesus! You scared
the hell out of us, man.

1324
01:22:22,431 --> 01:22:26,035
- Are you all right, bro?
- Okay!

1325
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:28,073
- Thank you!
- This is the least I could do.

1326
01:22:28,145 --> 01:22:30,119
No. There's a hell of a lot
less you could've done.

1327
01:22:30,143 --> 01:22:31,473
That was not an option.

1328
01:22:31,542 --> 01:22:33,429
You took a bullet for us, it was huge.

1329
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,341
You really did, man.

1330
01:22:38,135 --> 01:22:39,818
Thanks for pulling me out.
Seriously.

1331
01:22:40,773 --> 01:22:42,136
Yeah.

1332
01:22:42,211 --> 01:22:44,337
You got yourself out.
We did the easy part.

1333
01:22:44,409 --> 01:22:46,648
Literally, in my case,
I was just standing on the shore

1334
01:22:46,727 --> 01:22:48,101
while Atlas jumped down and got you.

1335
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:49,649
I'm serious.

1336
01:22:50,243 --> 01:22:52,130
Hey, you guys.
Something's not right.

1337
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:53,929
- What's wrong?
- What?

1338
01:22:55,518 --> 01:22:57,837
- It's fake.
- What?

1339
01:22:59,594 --> 01:23:01,117
No, I had the stick.

1340
01:23:01,192 --> 01:23:03,841
The actual stick.
I swear, it was in my hand,

1341
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:06,433
in the lab, and then I put it in
the little case thing.

1342
01:23:06,507 --> 01:23:08,681
- And I gave it to Atlas.
- Right, which I then gave to Dylan.

1343
01:23:08,705 --> 01:23:11,228
Is there any chance you've possibly
misplaced it at any point?

1344
01:23:11,302 --> 01:23:14,667
No, I took it from you
and then slipped it back in your coat

1345
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:16,501
when I pushed you out.

1346
01:23:16,577 --> 01:23:19,783
Either way, we're left holding
a whole sack full of nada.

1347
01:23:19,854 --> 01:23:22,457
Yeah, but they're gonna come after us
as if we do have something.

1348
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:25,896
No. Okay. I agree that somebody
got the better of us. Okay? Somehow.

1349
01:23:25,968 --> 01:23:28,366
But I don't agree
that we have a sack full of nada.

1350
01:23:28,445 --> 01:23:31,605
Because we're all here.
That's a sack full of something.

1351
01:23:32,601 --> 01:23:39,284
Listen, we all know that Walter is not
going to stop until he gets that chip.

1352
01:23:39,354 --> 01:23:42,912
And we're the only ones
that even know that he's alive.

1353
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:47,594
We can't just walk away.
That's not what the Horsemen do.

1354
01:23:50,383 --> 01:23:52,190
There's a quote. Um...

1355
01:23:52,261 --> 01:23:53,671
It's actually by the magician

1356
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:55,540
that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

1357
01:23:55,578 --> 01:23:57,499
It's, uh...

1358
01:23:57,576 --> 01:24:04,259
"A magician's greatest power lies
forever shrouded in his empty fist."

1359
01:24:04,329 --> 01:24:06,648
"And the very idea
that he can convince the world

1360
01:24:06,727 --> 01:24:09,887
that he is, in fact,
carrying with him a secret."

1361
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:12,805
- That's Lionel Shrike.
- Right.

1362
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:15,174
So what are you saying?

1363
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:18,404
That we should pretend like
we have something we don't?

1364
01:24:21,472 --> 01:24:24,871
- What is Walter's greatest fear?
- Being seen.

1365
01:24:24,948 --> 01:24:28,949
- And what does the stick do?
- The stick can unencode anything.

1366
01:24:29,024 --> 01:24:33,946
It can open up a back door
into any computer on the planet.

1367
01:24:34,019 --> 01:24:36,019
- Including his.
- Yeah.

1368
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:40,099
Right, we not only make him
think that we have it,

1369
01:24:40,173 --> 01:24:44,254
but that we're going to use it
to expose and destroy him.

1370
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:47,694
We need a plan.
But we don't have time.

1371
01:24:47,806 --> 01:24:51,249
We have each other
and there are five of us.

1372
01:24:51,322 --> 01:24:54,243
But we also need supplies, right?
And resources.

1373
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:57,604
And probably more than five people.

1374
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:01,563
Do you really think
you don't have help?

1375
01:25:01,632 --> 01:25:04,394
Oh, she speaks English.
Of course. Yeah.

1376
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:09,868
Do you know why the Fool is
the most powerful card in the tarot?

1377
01:25:09,943 --> 01:25:13,581
Not because the person
who draws him is a fool.

1378
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:18,104
He's a fool because he's a clean slate,

1379
01:25:18,175 --> 01:25:22,096
and, therefore, can become anything.

1380
01:25:22,171 --> 01:25:23,456
You were chosen.

1381
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:26,056
All of you.

1382
01:25:26,127 --> 01:25:31,333
Not because of who you are,
but because of who you might become.

1383
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,803
When you say "chosen"...
Are you part of the Eye?

1384
01:25:36,876 --> 01:25:40,922
Yes. We are part of the Eye.

1385
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:44,198
You've each doubted our existence.

1386
01:25:45,028 --> 01:25:49,348
Wondering if we,
indeed, were watching.

1387
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:56,578
We are.
We always have been.

1388
01:25:56,657 --> 01:25:59,180
This is the best
magic shop in the world.

1389
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:01,459
- You know what she's saying, right?
- Yes.

1390
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,930
That now we have
resources and help.

1391
01:26:05,728 --> 01:26:07,091
Thank you.

1392
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,246
So, who's in?

1393
01:26:15,038 --> 01:26:17,642
- I'm in.
- Yeah, I'm in.

1394
01:26:20,473 --> 01:26:21,473
Let's do this.

1395
01:26:39,174 --> 01:26:40,856
No, no, no.

1396
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:45,616
<i>Not long ago, we were tricked.</i>

1397
01:26:45,688 --> 01:26:48,609
<i>I was exposed
and brought back from the dead.</i>

1398
01:26:48,685 --> 01:26:51,526
<i>So we thought it was only fitting
that we do the same thing</i>

1399
01:26:51,602 --> 01:26:55,966
<i>- to the person who did it to us.
- Midnight, New Year's Eve. London.</i>

1400
01:26:56,037 --> 01:26:59,277
<i>We will be performing a series of shows
that all connect to our big finale,</i>

1401
01:26:59,354 --> 01:27:01,514
<i>so pay close attention to each trick.</i>

1402
01:27:01,592 --> 01:27:02,672
Get my father.

1403
01:27:04,828 --> 01:27:05,908
Run!

1404
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,147
I want Interpol, Scotland Yard,
whoever we have in London.

1405
01:27:09,264 --> 01:27:10,503
What do we know about Rhodes?

1406
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:12,424
Wherever the Horsemen are,
that's where he is.

1407
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:13,626
Let's get to the airport.

1408
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:16,153
<i>So leave your kiddies
at home and get ready for a wild night,</i>

1409
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:19,257
<i>because we, too, will bring
someone back from the dead.</i>

1410
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,141
Let's move, everyone!

1411
01:27:21,212 --> 01:27:23,146
<i>In front of
the largest stage in the world...</i>

1412
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:25,091
<i>The actual world.</i>

1413
01:27:25,168 --> 01:27:28,930
You know they're playing you, right?
Leading you into a trap?

1414
01:27:29,004 --> 01:27:30,653
Yeah, but the threat is real.

1415
01:27:30,762 --> 01:27:33,411
This card can hack into any system
on the planet, including ours.

1416
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,719
They have it, why wouldn't
they use it to expose us?

1417
01:27:35,797 --> 01:27:37,286
Me. Everything we've done.

1418
01:27:37,356 --> 01:27:39,402
Is it real, Mr. McKinney?

1419
01:27:46,786 --> 01:27:48,025
The threat is real.

1420
01:27:48,105 --> 01:27:50,390
So, how do we stay
ahead of them?

1421
01:27:50,463 --> 01:27:52,827
We need to get
to London by midnight.

1422
01:28:01,532 --> 01:28:03,106
<i>We are here in London</i>

1423
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:05,608
<i>on this New Year's Eve,
and the crowds are out in force.</i>

1424
01:28:05,688 --> 01:28:07,222
<i>Locals and tourists alike</i>

1425
01:28:07,246 --> 01:28:09,372
<i>getting ready for
the party of the year.</i>

1426
01:28:09,444 --> 01:28:11,418
<i>A video gone viral from the infamous</i>

1427
01:28:11,442 --> 01:28:13,283
<i>Horsemen magicians has surfaced.</i>

1428
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,094
<i>They promise
to make a grand reappearance.</i>

1429
01:28:15,118 --> 01:28:18,198
<i>But will it end in
their arrest on national television?</i>

1430
01:28:18,275 --> 01:28:19,957
<i>Or some sort of vindication?</i>

1431
01:28:20,033 --> 01:28:22,113
<i>Who knows where they'll show up...</i>

1432
01:28:22,191 --> 01:28:23,646
<i>But we do know, wherever,</i>

1433
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:26,795
<i>whenever that is,
people will be watching.</i>

1434
01:28:28,505 --> 01:28:30,426
Yeah, texts, tweets, Instagrams.

1435
01:28:30,503 --> 01:28:33,470
Anything that says "Horsemen,"
brags about seeing the Horsemen,

1436
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,222
tag them and bundle them.

1437
01:28:35,298 --> 01:28:37,663
Dad, who do we have security-wise
on this? Your guys?

1438
01:28:37,735 --> 01:28:38,895
Whoever you want.

1439
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:40,894
Well, we want all of them
and all their friends.

1440
01:28:40,972 --> 01:28:43,066
Anyone who wants to work
stationed throughout the city,

1441
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:44,897
so they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

1442
01:28:59,154 --> 01:29:01,439
Hello! Hey!

1443
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:05,152
My name's Jack Wilder.

1444
01:29:05,987 --> 01:29:07,953
Goddamn, it feels good to be back.

1445
01:29:08,025 --> 01:29:11,629
All right, gather around. Indulge me.

1446
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:13,906
I wanna talk to you about
something real quick.

1447
01:29:13,979 --> 01:29:17,866
You all know Three Card Monte,
also known as "Find the Lady"?

1448
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:22,255
Trick performed by street hustlers all
over the world. And why street hustlers?

1449
01:29:22,331 --> 01:29:25,218
Because as soon as you walk up
to the table, you lose.

1450
01:29:25,288 --> 01:29:27,254
Every time.
Let me demonstrate.

1451
01:29:29,723 --> 01:29:33,849
While we're at it,
let's find ourselves a life-sized Queen.

1452
01:29:33,919 --> 01:29:35,840
Ma'am, would you
mind being my Queen?

1453
01:29:39,154 --> 01:29:41,519
Don't worry. I promise you
there's a 50 percent chance

1454
01:29:41,592 --> 01:29:42,926
you'll get her back after the show.

1455
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:44,757
Head over there.
Thank you very much.

1456
01:29:44,828 --> 01:29:48,352
All right. Let's find ourselves
some Jacks to serve our Queen!

1457
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:49,709
<i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>

1458
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:53,546
I know how these guys work now.
They're gonna start with a tease.

1459
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:55,586
A few little pop-ups.

1460
01:29:55,657 --> 01:29:58,545
<i>Something to lure you in. Like...</i>

1461
01:29:58,614 --> 01:30:02,740
Well, you know, like Three Card Monte,
where the guy goes,

1462
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:05,379
"Looky here, but no, no, looky here!"

1463
01:30:05,448 --> 01:30:09,369
<i>Except when all these
little tricks are done,</i>

1464
01:30:09,444 --> 01:30:11,524
<i>the only thing
you're gonna be looking at</i>

1465
01:30:11,601 --> 01:30:15,602
is the inside of your own colon,
with the words

1466
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:18,598
<i>"Horsemen" written all over it.</i>

1467
01:30:19,314 --> 01:30:20,882
In blood.

1468
01:30:20,952 --> 01:30:24,431
We get the picture, Mr. McKinney.

1469
01:30:24,509 --> 01:30:26,555
And get out of my chair.

1470
01:30:26,626 --> 01:30:28,831
Hello, everybody!

1471
01:30:28,904 --> 01:30:30,870
Come close, come on!

1472
01:30:30,942 --> 01:30:32,863
All right, all right, so listen.

1473
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:38,419
Tonight, I am going to make
something fly using actual magic.

1474
01:30:38,495 --> 01:30:40,257
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

1475
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:43,379
I'm going to take
a very large vessel,

1476
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:47,814
I'm gonna make it fly over there
and land on the Thames.

1477
01:30:47,885 --> 01:30:49,726
Can you handle that?

1478
01:30:49,803 --> 01:30:51,327
Same rules apply as before.

1479
01:30:51,402 --> 01:30:53,482
All you need to do is
keep your eye on the Queen.

1480
01:30:53,559 --> 01:30:54,923
It's as simple as that.

1481
01:30:54,998 --> 01:30:56,725
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah!

1482
01:30:56,796 --> 01:30:58,240
Dad, look at this.

1483
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:00,968
Tag this one.
Where does it come from?

1484
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:03,118
Near the river.
Looks like the shows are starting.

1485
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:04,764
But we're not the only ones
who found them.

1486
01:31:04,788 --> 01:31:06,428
- What do you mean?
- It's on Channel One.

1487
01:31:14,658 --> 01:31:15,913
- Let's go to 2.
- Here we go.

1488
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:18,540
Got him. We have a location.

1489
01:31:18,614 --> 01:31:20,580
It's Jack Wilder.
Here come the Horsemen.

1490
01:31:20,652 --> 01:31:22,618
Okay, we're moving.
Let's go, let's go.

1491
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:24,418
Typing in grid coordinates now.

1492
01:31:26,207 --> 01:31:28,855
Turn around.
Hide yourselves with the cards.

1493
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:32,689
And here we go. Switch!

1494
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,333
You guys still have your eye on her?
You want me to go back and do it?

1495
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:39,437
Okay, all right. I'm moving on.
And switch.

1496
01:31:41,432 --> 01:31:42,478
Where is she?

1497
01:31:43,829 --> 01:31:45,875
Down at the end?
You sure?

1498
01:31:45,947 --> 01:31:48,754
All right, can I get a drumroll
from my man in the back?

1499
01:31:48,824 --> 01:31:50,745
Thank you very much.

1500
01:31:51,981 --> 01:31:53,504
Uh-oh.

1501
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:55,384
Uh-oh.

1502
01:31:56,656 --> 01:31:59,134
There's my girl.

1503
01:31:59,214 --> 01:32:01,817
Not my girl, 100 percent your girl.

1504
01:32:01,931 --> 01:32:03,261
But just in this situation.

1505
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:05,978
Okay, but I gotta warm up
a little bit first. Okay?

1506
01:32:06,047 --> 01:32:09,934
So, uh, let me just
make something small fly, like...

1507
01:32:10,003 --> 01:32:12,129
Fly, fly, fly!

1508
01:32:12,201 --> 01:32:15,599
Wow, right? Look at that!
Aw. Come on, people.

1509
01:32:15,717 --> 01:32:18,604
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1510
01:32:18,674 --> 01:32:19,799
- Me?
- Check your fly.

1511
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,909
You like that?

1512
01:32:24,988 --> 01:32:26,875
You support that relationship?

1513
01:32:26,946 --> 01:32:29,833
That guy had a bird in his pants.
That's disgusting.

1514
01:32:33,499 --> 01:32:35,593
<i>Copy that.
We've got two sightings reported.</i>

1515
01:32:35,617 --> 01:32:38,538
<i>- Heading to Greenwich Market.</i>
- Get me Thaddeus.

1516
01:32:38,614 --> 01:32:40,899
<i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.
They're moving.</i>

1517
01:32:41,012 --> 01:32:44,092
Let 'em move.
That's what the Horsemen want.

1518
01:32:44,169 --> 01:32:45,903
Well, what if they get there first?
That can't happen.

1519
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:48,053
<i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>

1520
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:49,330
Find the pattern.

1521
01:32:50,283 --> 01:32:53,250
You do that, and you'll be able
to cut them off

1522
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,718
<i>before they get to their final trick.</i>

1523
01:32:55,797 --> 01:32:59,514
If it makes you feel better,
I'll take care of the FBI.

1524
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:15,224
OK, well, I guess you found me!

1525
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:16,866
We've got a third spot.

1526
01:33:16,936 --> 01:33:19,459
Okay, everybody,
we're getting a pattern.

1527
01:33:21,811 --> 01:33:26,892
Urn... Give me two, 13 and 21.

1528
01:33:27,965 --> 01:33:30,852
What the hell is that?
Freeze that and zoom in.

1529
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,722
How the hell did this happen?

1530
01:33:35,837 --> 01:33:38,963
He's dead. We watched him drown.
How the hell did this happen?

1531
01:33:39,034 --> 01:33:41,557
Given that it did happen,
the pertinent question is,

1532
01:33:41,631 --> 01:33:42,686
what are we gonna do about it?

1533
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:44,472
We're gonna stop him, Dad.
We'll stop him.

1534
01:33:44,548 --> 01:33:45,628
Where's my coat?

1535
01:33:45,707 --> 01:33:48,435
Walter, for the record,
I never loved the safe idea.

1536
01:33:48,504 --> 01:33:50,063
Oh, I know
where they're going.

1537
01:33:50,103 --> 01:33:52,706
The next show is Merritt's
and it's by the river.

1538
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,190
Chase, you need
to get to him

1539
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:56,499
so we can find the Horsemen's
entry point for the finale.

1540
01:34:02,091 --> 01:34:05,728
I have a confession to make. I've been
told I have some control issues.

1541
01:34:05,847 --> 01:34:09,166
I've learned that it's really,
really hard to control people,

1542
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:13,165
so I'm gonna try to control something
that's a lot easier than people.

1543
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,680
I'm gonna try to
control the weather.

1544
01:34:14,718 --> 01:34:17,480
Yeah, rain, um...

1545
01:34:18,994 --> 01:34:20,688
It'd be a little difficult
to make it rain, right?

1546
01:34:20,712 --> 01:34:23,474
That would be something
that only God can do, right?

1547
01:34:23,549 --> 01:34:25,834
I'm gonna do something
that God can't do.

1548
01:34:25,907 --> 01:34:28,794
I'm not just gonna make it clear up.
No, no, no.

1549
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,944
I'm gonna make it actually stop.

1550
01:34:44,249 --> 01:34:47,454
And can God do that?
Mmm. No, I don't think so.

1551
01:34:47,525 --> 01:34:49,890
Or what about make it go up?

1552
01:34:57,555 --> 01:34:59,555
Are you still with me?

1553
01:34:59,633 --> 01:35:02,679
Watch the Queen on the left.
Let's do it. Turn around.

1554
01:35:06,027 --> 01:35:07,152
Switch!

1555
01:35:10,862 --> 01:35:12,022
Show me the lady.

1556
01:35:12,101 --> 01:35:14,908
Show me the lady!

1557
01:35:14,978 --> 01:35:16,183
The end? End?

1558
01:35:18,654 --> 01:35:20,814
You know what?
I'm actually starting to feel kinda bad.

1559
01:35:21,771 --> 01:35:24,897
It's just because I can actually feel
that you guys are paying attention.

1560
01:35:24,968 --> 01:35:26,570
It's just that...

1561
01:35:26,646 --> 01:35:30,090
You know, it's unfortunate
that it's the wrong kind of attention.

1562
01:35:31,321 --> 01:35:33,799
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1563
01:35:34,998 --> 01:35:38,078
He's so cute. He's so cute!

1564
01:35:38,155 --> 01:35:40,917
Let's kill him, right?

1565
01:35:40,992 --> 01:35:44,959
- Merritt, move into position.
- Got it, Dylan.

1566
01:35:45,028 --> 01:35:46,710
Uh, I'm on my way.
I'll see you there.

1567
01:35:46,786 --> 01:35:49,151
Lula, stand by, all right?

1568
01:35:49,263 --> 01:35:51,582
Or, what about just go,
I don't know, just go insane?

1569
01:36:01,132 --> 01:36:03,575
<i>Reports are
coming in from all over London</i>

1570
01:36:03,649 --> 01:36:07,252
<i>as the Horsemen appear to have taken
over the whole city for their show.</i>

1571
01:36:10,282 --> 01:36:13,965
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski?
Where you headed?

1572
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:15,373
- Please, bro, don't do this.
- Where are you headed?

1573
01:36:15,397 --> 01:36:17,205
North, south, east?

1574
01:36:18,075 --> 01:36:19,598
East. Tower of London?

1575
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:22,435
Tower Bridge?
Near Tower Bridge? The Thames!

1576
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:27,034
You're going to
the Thamesy-Whemsy! You're so easy!

1577
01:36:27,106 --> 01:36:29,754
Bro, if there's any chance of us
ever having a relationship...

1578
01:36:29,823 --> 01:36:32,221
There's not.
Where's your entry?

1579
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:36,097
South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich.

1580
01:36:36,177 --> 01:36:39,780
I know where you're going.
I know where...

1581
01:36:41,132 --> 01:36:42,495
Watch it, hobo.

1582
01:36:45,407 --> 01:36:47,931
Hey, Merritt. Oh, come on.
Tell me you're kidding. How?

1583
01:36:49,723 --> 01:36:51,087
When?

1584
01:36:51,162 --> 01:36:53,810
Shit. All right. All right, I got it.

1585
01:36:53,879 --> 01:36:55,925
Don't worry about it.
I'll warn the others.

1586
01:36:58,874 --> 01:37:00,556
Sorry. Just...

1587
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:04,364
What? I just told you...

1588
01:37:04,388 --> 01:37:05,388
Phone call.

1589
01:37:06,786 --> 01:37:07,866
- Hello?
<i>- Lula.</i>

1590
01:37:07,945 --> 01:37:11,309
Dylan. Ah, yeah, kind of in the middle
of something right now.

1591
01:37:11,381 --> 01:37:13,950
<i>Wrap it up.
Meet me at the rendezvous point now.</i>

1592
01:37:14,019 --> 01:37:15,303
- What?
<i>- Now!</i>

1593
01:37:15,977 --> 01:37:17,943
Was that an act of God?

1594
01:37:18,055 --> 01:37:21,135
No. No, no, no,
that was an act of me

1595
01:37:21,211 --> 01:37:24,371
And the strobe lights
and rain machines.

1596
01:37:24,448 --> 01:37:26,369
And I hope you guys
were paying attention.

1597
01:37:26,446 --> 01:37:28,806
Because you're gonna need to know
all of that for the final.

1598
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:35,280
So how did I do it?
Did I use a Barry Trap?

1599
01:37:35,357 --> 01:37:37,676
Maybe some switches
or a few duplicates?

1600
01:37:37,755 --> 01:37:38,801
<i>Wham Jack, go now!</i>

1601
01:37:38,874 --> 01:37:39,969
You know what?
I hate to say it.

1602
01:37:39,993 --> 01:37:41,793
You're gonna have to wait to find out.
I know.

1603
01:37:41,831 --> 01:37:44,229
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you all.

1604
01:37:47,665 --> 01:37:48,745
<i>Lula, go!</i>

1605
01:37:48,824 --> 01:37:50,904
I have to go.

1606
01:38:09,763 --> 01:38:13,969
Out of the way, FBI!
Move, move, move! Go!

1607
01:38:14,039 --> 01:38:15,766
Get some men in that park!

1608
01:38:15,837 --> 01:38:16,962
Men in the park, now!

1609
01:38:17,036 --> 01:38:19,161
You gonna fill up on appetizers?

1610
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:21,882
Or save room for
the main course?

1611
01:38:21,951 --> 01:38:23,758
Where the hell
are the Horsemen?

1612
01:38:23,829 --> 01:38:25,069
You can chase them
all you want,

1613
01:38:25,147 --> 01:38:27,625
you're just gonna wind up
holding your own tails.

1614
01:38:28,624 --> 01:38:31,431
Or, you can let them
come to you.

1615
01:38:31,501 --> 01:38:33,070
So, what's it gonna be?

1616
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:34,304
Chase them?

1617
01:38:35,297 --> 01:38:36,661
Or make a deal with me?

1618
01:38:43,129 --> 01:38:44,937
Again? How did we
get found out again?

1619
01:38:45,008 --> 01:38:46,822
It's fine, it's fine.
We'll just cut to the finale.

1620
01:38:46,846 --> 01:38:48,380
- Where's Merritt?
- Fine. I don't know.

1621
01:38:48,404 --> 01:38:49,404
I'm here.

1622
01:38:49,483 --> 01:38:51,290
- Where's Lula?
- I'm right here!

1623
01:38:51,361 --> 01:38:53,248
What the hell happened?

1624
01:38:53,319 --> 01:38:55,253
- My goddamn brother happened.
- Don't worry about it.

1625
01:38:55,277 --> 01:38:56,766
We just gotta get to the destination.

1626
01:38:56,836 --> 01:38:58,810
- Lula, can you handle that thing?
- I can ride it.

1627
01:38:58,834 --> 01:39:00,834
Have you asked the guys
that question, or just me?

1628
01:39:00,912 --> 01:39:02,150
- Yeah, good point.
- Let's go!

1629
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:03,310
No, Jack.

1630
01:39:07,985 --> 01:39:08,985
Shit!

1631
01:39:11,941 --> 01:39:13,419
Jack's down. We gotta get him.

1632
01:39:16,736 --> 01:39:17,782
Come on, move!

1633
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:25,488
- Jack! Go, go!
- That's the brake.

1634
01:39:25,567 --> 01:39:27,169
That's the gas.
You'll figure it out.

1635
01:39:27,245 --> 01:39:28,928
Come on, follow me!

1636
01:39:30,202 --> 01:39:31,202
That's it?

1637
01:39:47,825 --> 01:39:49,427
- Hey, ready?
- Yeah!

1638
01:39:56,256 --> 01:39:57,586
Get on.

1639
01:40:01,411 --> 01:40:03,537
- Yeah!
- Okay, guys, I'm coming!

1640
01:40:03,609 --> 01:40:05,928
Whoa! Jesus!

1641
01:40:07,365 --> 01:40:09,127
I'm coming!

1642
01:40:17,235 --> 01:40:19,076
- Get up! Come on!
- Okay.

1643
01:40:20,472 --> 01:40:21,677
You got me.

1644
01:40:21,751 --> 01:40:23,911
Those things are really dangerous!

1645
01:40:25,667 --> 01:40:27,872
- Come on!
- Go!

1646
01:40:29,663 --> 01:40:31,823
Get him in! Move it!

1647
01:40:36,256 --> 01:40:37,905
What is happening?

1648
01:40:38,014 --> 01:40:40,253
Where are they?

1649
01:40:40,332 --> 01:40:42,332
They should be
arriving any second.

1650
01:40:43,609 --> 01:40:46,052
That is, if they're gonna
get here by midnight.

1651
01:40:55,237 --> 01:40:57,124
Ah!

1652
01:40:58,314 --> 01:41:00,713
Okay, feeling fear.

1653
01:41:01,071 --> 01:41:03,754
Fear. Anger, anger.

1654
01:41:04,468 --> 01:41:07,469
- Oh, full house!
- That's enough.

1655
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:10,473
I was done.

1656
01:41:11,421 --> 01:41:15,502
So nice to see you all again.

1657
01:41:15,577 --> 01:41:21,101
But since we're such old friends,
let's skip the formalities.

1658
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:26,853
One of you
has something we require.

1659
01:41:28,484 --> 01:41:30,132
So give it over.

1660
01:41:38,314 --> 01:41:40,599
Nothing at all?

1661
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:44,274
Really?

1662
01:41:46,066 --> 01:41:47,476
Sit down!

1663
01:41:54,658 --> 01:41:56,101
Let's go, let's go!

1664
01:41:57,335 --> 01:41:58,665
Let's go, let's go!

1665
01:41:58,734 --> 01:42:01,337
Hurry up and move them quickly
before they can do anything.

1666
01:42:01,411 --> 01:42:02,571
Get those lights off me!

1667
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:09,932
Get on the plane!

1668
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,120
Ow! Hey!

1669
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:17,795
Get on the plane!

1670
01:42:27,385 --> 01:42:28,624
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

1671
01:42:28,704 --> 01:42:30,591
Yeah, uh, take off immediately.

1672
01:42:33,978 --> 01:42:36,627
You know, you make it almost too easy?

1673
01:42:36,696 --> 01:42:40,378
I mean, even your hilarious attempts
to make yourselves unpredictable,

1674
01:42:40,452 --> 01:42:42,293
just follow the same pattern each time.

1675
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:44,370
Set up, set up, set up.

1676
01:42:44,448 --> 01:42:45,687
Big reveal.

1677
01:42:45,767 --> 01:42:48,165
Which tonight was going
to be stroke of midnight,

1678
01:42:48,244 --> 01:42:50,972
middle of the Thames?
Tell me if I'm warm.

1679
01:42:55,876 --> 01:42:59,673
Well, there will be a big reveal,
and it will come now.

1680
01:43:01,431 --> 01:43:04,511
The stick, dear boy.

1681
01:43:05,067 --> 01:43:06,352
- No.
- Fine.

1682
01:43:06,905 --> 01:43:09,110
Start with her.

1683
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,502
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

1684
01:43:13,699 --> 01:43:17,097
- Give it to him.
- Danny, give him the card.

1685
01:43:17,175 --> 01:43:19,016
- Just give it to him.
- Danny, come on.

1686
01:43:29,043 --> 01:43:30,168
We'll have a closer look.

1687
01:43:38,634 --> 01:43:40,600
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1688
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:42,956
Leader, you should have
planned an escape, okay?

1689
01:43:43,029 --> 01:43:44,684
- This is the both of us.
- Okay, it's the both of us.

1690
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:46,196
- Guys, come on!
- Come on, stop!

1691
01:43:46,266 --> 01:43:49,073
- You, to save your little girlfriend!
- To save my...

1692
01:43:49,143 --> 01:43:51,428
- He had a knife to her head!
- I'm a Horseman, you dick!

1693
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:52,995
All right, you know what?
This is not the time!

1694
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:54,463
And you, what's your deal, man?

1695
01:43:54,538 --> 01:43:56,664
Look, they're not gonna get blood
all over the seats.

1696
01:43:56,736 --> 01:43:58,430
They're probably gonna
throw us out of the plane.

1697
01:43:58,454 --> 01:43:59,788
- Really?
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

1698
01:43:59,812 --> 01:44:01,938
but I just have to
say congratulations.

1699
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:03,215
And thank you!

1700
01:44:04,767 --> 01:44:06,006
It's real.

1701
01:44:06,086 --> 01:44:07,496
What?

1702
01:44:07,565 --> 01:44:09,088
It's real?

1703
01:44:10,801 --> 01:44:11,847
Bring them through.

1704
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,000
Did you say it's real?

1705
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:14,134
What is he talking about?

1706
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:15,363
Move!

1707
01:44:15,437 --> 01:44:16,960
Well done, my boy.

1708
01:44:20,831 --> 01:44:23,230
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

1709
01:44:23,309 --> 01:44:27,435
It's the most expensive bottle on Earth.

1710
01:44:28,344 --> 01:44:30,470
$1.2 million.

1711
01:44:30,542 --> 01:44:34,543
And I saved it just for this occasion.

1712
01:44:34,618 --> 01:44:38,857
Honestly, same bottle,
Liquor Shack, 700K.

1713
01:44:38,933 --> 01:44:42,059
Hey. You got what you wanted.

1714
01:44:42,130 --> 01:44:44,654
So, does this mean
you're letting us go?

1715
01:44:44,727 --> 01:44:47,649
Knowing what you
know about us? No.

1716
01:44:47,724 --> 01:44:51,407
- You sure?
- Chase, what shall we do?

1717
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,359
Toss them out.

1718
01:44:55,437 --> 01:44:58,005
Get your last words
in quickly, everybody!

1719
01:44:59,952 --> 01:45:03,396
- No! Come on! No!
- Farewell.

1720
01:45:03,748 --> 01:45:05,953
Oh, God! No!

1721
01:45:07,225 --> 01:45:09,624
Wait! I just wanna say...

1722
01:45:09,702 --> 01:45:11,941
I came into the world
with the wrong family,

1723
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,986
but I'm leaving with the right one.

1724
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:15,627
I love you guys!

1725
01:45:15,696 --> 01:45:16,742
- No!
- No, no, no!

1726
01:45:18,574 --> 01:45:21,017
This is how I kicked
you out of the womb.

1727
01:45:21,091 --> 01:45:22,171
No!

1728
01:45:23,688 --> 01:45:25,052
Who's next?

1729
01:45:31,201 --> 01:45:33,042
No, wait! Let me go!

1730
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,438
Let go of me!

1731
01:45:35,517 --> 01:45:37,835
No, no, no!

1732
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:39,597
- Let me go!
- Toss her!

1733
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:44,911
Oh, God!

1734
01:45:44,987 --> 01:45:47,988
Hurry up and shut that door!
It's getting cold in here.

1735
01:45:48,064 --> 01:45:49,985
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1736
01:45:55,617 --> 01:45:56,741
No, no, no!

1737
01:45:58,174 --> 01:46:00,413
A lot of brain,
but not enough brawn.

1738
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:05,208
Oh, that was fun!

1739
01:46:08,084 --> 01:46:11,085
Cheers! Well done, my boy.

1740
01:46:15,597 --> 01:46:16,926
Um...

1741
01:46:16,995 --> 01:46:19,155
No, is it supposed to taste like that?

1742
01:46:19,273 --> 01:46:20,761
No, it is not.

1743
01:46:40,572 --> 01:46:42,140
What the hell is going on?

1744
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:54,359
Okay, come pick them up!

1745
01:46:55,077 --> 01:46:56,804
- Come on.
- Come on out.

1746
01:47:10,062 --> 01:47:13,904
<i>Ladies and gentlemen... The Horsemen!</i>

1747
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:36,477
<i>No, you should feel pretty
good about yourself, man.</i>

1748
01:47:36,595 --> 01:47:40,119
<i>You predicted it correctly.
The Thames, stroke of midnight.</i>

1749
01:47:40,192 --> 01:47:41,999
<i>New Year's Eve. Happy New Year!</i>

1750
01:47:49,023 --> 01:47:50,308
Unbelievable!

1751
01:47:50,382 --> 01:47:51,756
- We are moving now.
- The whole thing just changed.

1752
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:54,542
- All backup into position stat!
- We're on the move.

1753
01:47:56,016 --> 01:47:58,255
- You're staying here!
- Of course.

1754
01:48:05,606 --> 01:48:07,448
Move! Move! Out of the way!

1755
01:48:07,524 --> 01:48:09,763
Wow! Thank you very much, London!

1756
01:48:09,842 --> 01:48:14,127
We would like to acknowledge not just
our old friend, Arthur Tressler.

1757
01:48:14,198 --> 01:48:16,766
But his young and very
brilliant son, Walter Mabry.

1758
01:48:16,835 --> 01:48:19,234
Who has performed one of the
greatest feats of illusion

1759
01:48:19,313 --> 01:48:20,961
even we have ever seen.

1760
01:48:21,031 --> 01:48:25,237
He has, amazingly, brought
himself back from the dead!

1761
01:48:25,347 --> 01:48:27,950
But before he did that,

1762
01:48:28,024 --> 01:48:29,388
he revealed someone.

1763
01:48:29,463 --> 01:48:34,588
And we think it only right
to give him a proper introduction.

1764
01:48:34,657 --> 01:48:38,658
He is our friend and he is our leader.
Dylan Shrike!

1765
01:48:38,733 --> 01:48:40,733
- Get over here!
- Yeah!

1766
01:48:46,605 --> 01:48:48,651
So, normally

1767
01:48:48,763 --> 01:48:53,447
only the magician, his assistant,
and a few trusted stage hands

1768
01:48:53,518 --> 01:48:55,757
know the secret of a trick.

1769
01:48:55,836 --> 01:48:58,837
But tonight, however, in this effect,

1770
01:48:58,913 --> 01:49:01,993
all of you people
around the Thames here.

1771
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:06,707
And since we're streaming live,
everyone around the world

1772
01:49:06,785 --> 01:49:09,309
already knows everything.

1773
01:49:09,383 --> 01:49:13,463
And only these fellows
here are the ones left in the dark.

1774
01:49:13,538 --> 01:49:16,459
So let's see how closely
you were watching our shows.

1775
01:49:16,535 --> 01:49:20,253
Remember when we were playing
"Find the Lady," and I said

1776
01:49:20,332 --> 01:49:22,253
<i>that we used a Barry Trap.</i>

1777
01:49:23,049 --> 01:49:26,606
<i>Some classic switches
and a few duplicates?</i>

1778
01:49:26,685 --> 01:49:30,209
<i>Well, that's how we switched
the driver of the truck.</i>

1779
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:35,517
<i>Which took us to a duplicate hangar</i>

1780
01:49:35,636 --> 01:49:38,160
<i>where we used your need to rush,</i>

1781
01:49:38,234 --> 01:49:41,235
<i>and your fear of being seen
let you do the work for us.</i>

1782
01:49:41,311 --> 01:49:43,118
Get those lights off me!

1783
01:49:44,427 --> 01:49:48,667
So, the airplane.
How did we get it to fly?

1784
01:49:49,742 --> 01:49:54,538
<i>Well, we used fans,
and lights and rain machines.</i>

1785
01:49:59,772 --> 01:50:04,409
Obviously, all of this was
reliant on us getting caught.

1786
01:50:04,487 --> 01:50:05,772
But we needed to make sure

1787
01:50:05,886 --> 01:50:07,966
that you would do exactly
what we needed you to do

1788
01:50:08,044 --> 01:50:09,532
once you did catch us.

1789
01:50:09,602 --> 01:50:15,683
My brother Chase, who was
technical adviser to the losing team.

1790
01:50:15,756 --> 01:50:18,404
He taught us that it's
all about blind spots.

1791
01:50:18,513 --> 01:50:20,037
I know where you're going!

1792
01:50:20,112 --> 01:50:23,715
And, uh, surprises.

1793
01:50:25,546 --> 01:50:27,070
Watch it, hobo.

1794
01:50:27,145 --> 01:50:28,827
Why don't you watch
the watch I'm wearing,

1795
01:50:28,903 --> 01:50:31,551
the where of where
you're watching, and sleep!

1796
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:34,939
It's going to be your idea to throw
the Horsemen out of the plane.

1797
01:50:35,017 --> 01:50:37,494
If all of this is
kind of confusing to you,

1798
01:50:37,574 --> 01:50:39,540
I can maybe catch you up on it later.

1799
01:50:39,612 --> 01:50:42,056
Probably see you what, three to five?

1800
01:50:43,209 --> 01:50:47,573
Come on, put it there.
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

1801
01:50:48,124 --> 01:50:51,091
Basically, we showed them everything.

1802
01:50:51,161 --> 01:50:56,446
How you kidnapped us to steal the very
thing that is in your pocket right now.

1803
01:50:58,673 --> 01:51:00,037
Whoops!

1804
01:51:03,668 --> 01:51:06,112
You know, this thing here,

1805
01:51:06,186 --> 01:51:09,664
which you said you could
use to adjust markets,

1806
01:51:09,742 --> 01:51:13,424
manipulate governments,
and spy on whomever you choose.

1807
01:51:13,498 --> 01:51:15,339
Also, you could, as you said,

1808
01:51:15,416 --> 01:51:18,576
control the public
from outside the grid.

1809
01:51:19,492 --> 01:51:24,778
These men destroy people's lives.

1810
01:51:24,887 --> 01:51:28,933
Spying on the world, robbing you
of your right to privacy.

1811
01:51:29,003 --> 01:51:32,243
And they do that
by hiding in the dark.

1812
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:36,877
So, in the Horsemen tradition,
we're here to expose them.

1813
01:51:36,955 --> 01:51:41,990
Tonight, they, like all of us,

1814
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:45,230
are finally stepping into the light.

1815
01:51:49,183 --> 01:51:50,387
Thank you, everybody!

1816
01:51:50,461 --> 01:51:53,065
We are the Horsemen
and we will be back very soon!

1817
01:51:55,376 --> 01:51:59,377
Five, four, three, two, one!

1818
01:52:16,196 --> 01:52:18,799
- Hey, we're on the clock.
- Get a move on.

1819
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:22,995
There they are!

1820
01:52:23,069 --> 01:52:25,115
- There's more inside.
- Don't you bloody touch me!

1821
01:52:25,187 --> 01:52:26,869
The Horsemen are over on the...

1822
01:52:29,662 --> 01:52:31,106
Oh, shit!

1823
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:33,587
Stay with them!

1824
01:52:33,658 --> 01:52:35,658
Everybody spread out!

1825
01:52:35,736 --> 01:52:37,577
Nobody leaves this barge!

1826
01:52:39,492 --> 01:52:42,572
Rhodes, hold it right there!
Do not move!

1827
01:52:48,243 --> 01:52:49,926
This contains everything.

1828
01:52:50,002 --> 01:52:53,082
Not just Walter and Tressler,
but all their dealings.

1829
01:52:53,159 --> 01:52:56,160
All their contacts,
the entire network.

1830
01:52:56,235 --> 01:52:58,440
And why on Earth
would I believe you?

1831
01:52:58,553 --> 01:53:02,191
I told you.
I'm the same man I've always been.

1832
01:53:02,269 --> 01:53:04,747
Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

1833
01:53:04,827 --> 01:53:07,634
I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

1834
01:53:07,704 --> 01:53:10,910
I'm a patsy!
I'm a patsy!

1835
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:13,707
Ten minutes.

1836
01:53:15,496 --> 01:53:17,542
Now you're playing
the long game.

1837
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:33,639
Dad, I promise you I will fix this.

1838
01:53:33,718 --> 01:53:36,083
You can't. Stop calling me dad.

1839
01:53:36,156 --> 01:53:40,077
There were so many women,
I have no idea whose bastard you are.

1840
01:53:40,152 --> 01:53:41,276
What?

1841
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:43,715
- What happened?
- Thin air, gone. Come with me.

1842
01:53:43,788 --> 01:53:47,425
What're you talking about, gone?
People don't just disappear.

1843
01:53:47,504 --> 01:53:50,232
You realize that he doesn't actually
have magical powers!

1844
01:54:29,862 --> 01:54:31,305
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

1845
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:33,779
- Good to see you all.
- Good to see you, Li.

1846
01:54:34,897 --> 01:54:36,022
Come on in.

1847
01:54:39,292 --> 01:54:42,133
Good morning. Welcome.

1848
01:54:44,567 --> 01:54:48,124
I'm proud of you.
All of you.

1849
01:54:48,203 --> 01:54:51,727
I have a lot to show you. Come.

1850
01:54:52,959 --> 01:54:54,197
Come.

1851
01:55:05,546 --> 01:55:06,751
Dad.

1852
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:25,770
Yes.

1853
01:55:25,886 --> 01:55:28,614
Your father and I were partners.

1854
01:55:28,683 --> 01:55:31,843
Our act was that of rivals.

1855
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:38,676
I was the hard-eyed realist.
He was the dreamy-eyed idealist.

1856
01:55:38,753 --> 01:55:41,481
We thought it was the perfect misdirect.

1857
01:55:42,549 --> 01:55:46,186
Yes, in public, I did goad him.

1858
01:55:46,265 --> 01:55:51,107
The only thing we didn't count on
was it going so wrong.

1859
01:55:55,136 --> 01:55:56,944
Why?

1860
01:55:57,054 --> 01:55:58,782
Why didn't you ever say anything to me?

1861
01:55:58,853 --> 01:56:00,376
I don't know.

1862
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:02,815
Give it a name.

1863
01:56:02,929 --> 01:56:06,327
Shame, guilt. Regret.

1864
01:56:10,081 --> 01:56:13,048
Hey, guys, uh, you might
wanna come take a look at this.

1865
01:56:14,717 --> 01:56:15,763
Hmm.

1866
01:56:17,234 --> 01:56:18,439
Look.

1867
01:56:18,553 --> 01:56:20,315
<i>I put you in jail, man.</i>

1868
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:22,756
Why didn't you
say something then?

1869
01:56:22,829 --> 01:56:25,830
Well, you know, I was going to.

1870
01:56:25,906 --> 01:56:30,543
But then, you were so quick to show
your personal motivations that...

1871
01:56:31,820 --> 01:56:35,218
Well, quite frankly
it spoiled the trick for me.

1872
01:56:35,296 --> 01:56:36,581
I showed my weakness.

1873
01:56:36,655 --> 01:56:39,462
Well, it showed you weren't ready.

1874
01:56:39,532 --> 01:56:42,180
But when you came back to my cell,

1875
01:56:42,249 --> 01:56:46,648
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me...

1876
01:56:47,644 --> 01:56:49,132
...for your Horsemen.

1877
01:56:50,721 --> 01:56:55,404
<i>And I said to myself,
"That's Lionel's boy."</i>

1878
01:56:56,275 --> 01:56:59,674
<i>And I knew it was my job to see to it</i>

1879
01:56:59,752 --> 01:57:03,469
<i>that he became the magician
he was born to be.</i>

1880
01:57:03,548 --> 01:57:05,867
All that was left then was...

1881
01:57:07,624 --> 01:57:08,954
For me to hit bottom.

1882
01:57:09,742 --> 01:57:14,584
So the safe, my father's wristwatch,
that was all you?

1883
01:57:17,374 --> 01:57:20,693
<i>Walter and Tressler,
were they in on it too?</i>

1884
01:57:20,771 --> 01:57:23,612
<i>Oh, we knew
Walter was in hiding.</i>

1885
01:57:23,688 --> 01:57:27,405
<i>The Octa show was a setup
to expose him to the public.</i>

1886
01:57:29,122 --> 01:57:32,566
<i>And you were right
about the Horsemen.</i>

1887
01:57:32,679 --> 01:57:37,714
<i>They needed to learn to work together
like a single organism.</i>

1888
01:57:45,386 --> 01:57:47,989
Now I know why
you look so familiar.

1889
01:57:48,063 --> 01:57:49,666
You're the Horsemen, aren't you?

1890
01:57:57,374 --> 01:57:58,784
Okay.

1891
01:57:58,853 --> 01:58:00,899
<i>But that can't be
what all this is about.</i>

1892
01:58:01,010 --> 01:58:05,489
You know, the best tricks
work on many levels.

1893
01:58:05,566 --> 01:58:09,533
And the deepest one,
for me, at least,

1894
01:58:09,602 --> 01:58:12,409
is this moment right here.

1895
01:58:16,035 --> 01:58:17,559
I'm sorry, Dylan.

1896
01:58:18,193 --> 01:58:20,717
I miss your father.

1897
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:24,269
Thirty years is a long time to drag
something around, isn't it?

1898
01:58:24,387 --> 01:58:26,035
Yes, it is.

1899
01:58:35,975 --> 01:58:37,260
So, now what?

1900
01:58:39,692 --> 01:58:42,579
- Now I'm about out of moves.
- Oh...

1901
01:58:42,649 --> 01:58:44,012
And I'm tired.

1902
01:58:44,087 --> 01:58:46,461
Come on, you're the one who said
that you believe that this road

1903
01:58:46,485 --> 01:58:48,451
led to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

1904
01:58:48,523 --> 01:58:49,569
I did.

1905
01:58:49,642 --> 01:58:51,802
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

1906
01:58:53,198 --> 01:58:54,880
I am.

1907
01:59:00,671 --> 01:59:03,114
It's your game now.

1908
01:59:03,188 --> 01:59:05,792
You play it however you see fit.

1909
01:59:07,024 --> 01:59:12,866
My suggestion, however, is that
you find yourself a successor.

1910
01:59:12,938 --> 01:59:14,826
Hi. Okay, so, um...

1911
01:59:14,896 --> 01:59:18,215
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions. Right?

1912
01:59:18,293 --> 01:59:20,771
Uh... By "a few,"
I think he means, like, five million.

1913
01:59:20,850 --> 01:59:22,419
- Yeah.
- Well.

1914
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:24,330
Good luck to you all.

1915
01:59:24,407 --> 01:59:26,055
- Okay. See, that's not fair.
- What!

1916
01:59:26,125 --> 01:59:27,260
- Come on.
- That's not right.

1917
01:59:27,284 --> 01:59:28,619
That's gonna make me really angry!

1918
01:59:28,643 --> 01:59:29,897
Not right now.

1919
01:59:29,921 --> 01:59:31,524
Oh, um, by the way...

1920
01:59:33,758 --> 01:59:36,235
Pay no attention to the curtain.

1921
01:59:39,152 --> 01:59:40,516
There is a curtain.

1922
01:59:40,591 --> 01:59:41,920
Go, go, go!

1923
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:55,745
<i>Seeing is believing.
But is it truth?</i>

1924
01:59:55,815 --> 01:59:58,464
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

1925
01:59:58,533 --> 02:00:01,056
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

1926
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:05,450
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

1927
02:00:05,526 --> 02:00:08,652
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

1928
02:00:08,763 --> 02:00:14,321
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you</i>

1929
02:00:14,397 --> 02:00:17,045
<i>in ways you can't expect.</i>

1930
02:00:17,913 --> 02:00:20,596
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

1931
02:00:20,671 --> 02:00:23,796
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

1932
02:00:23,867 --> 02:00:27,755
<i>is an eye for an eye.</i>

1933
02:00:28,305 --> 02:01:28,375
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
