2
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,240
This global warming is killing me.

3
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,320
This is too hot,
the Ice Age was too cold.

4
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,409
What would it take to make you happy?

5
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:25,079
This I like.

6
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,948
Oh, no, you won't catch me.

7
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:11,288
No running, James. Camp rules.

8
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,587
Make me, sloth.

9
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:19,008
Make me, sir. It's all about respect.

10
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,718
Water ball.

11
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:25,268
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.

12
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:27,728
Hector, no, no, no,
you can't pee-pee there.

13
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:30,728
OK, there is fine.
Ashley, stop picking your...

14
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:32,397
PiЕ„ata!

15
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:35,687
Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds.

16
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,697
OK.

17
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,407
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth.
- Mine.

18
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:42,487
- Mine.
- Mine.

19
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,626
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.

20
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:53,086
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!

21
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,006
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
could torture the sloth?

22
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:03,887
Manny, don't squash their creativity.

23
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:07,886
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammals-jammals.

24
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:10,096
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

25
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:16,396
Look, I opened my camp.
"Campo del Sid". It means Camp of Sid.

26
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:20,356
Congratulations.
You're now an idiot in two languages.

27
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:25,116
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These little guys love me. Right, Billy?

28
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:27,445
Don't make me eat you.

29
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,745
They kid. That's why they're called kids.

30
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:34,625
I told you, Sid.
You're not qualified to run a camp.

31
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:37,455
What do qualifications
have to do with childcare?

32
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:42,085
Besides, these kids look up to me.
I'm a role model to them.

33
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,965
I can see that.

34
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:50,555
You guys never think I can do anything,
but I'm an equal member of this herd.

35
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:56,225
I made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.

36
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,314
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.

37
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,364
Hey, let's play
pin-the-tail-on-the-mammoth.

38
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,904
Yeah!

39
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:07,944
Sid!

40
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,034
I can do stuff.

41
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:14,164
Won't give me their stupid respect.

42
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,333
I'll show 'em.

43
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:26,213
And so, in the end,
the little burro reached his mommy.

44
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:29,304
And they lived happily ever after.

45
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:34,304
- Good job.
- Question.

46
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,853
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?

47
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:41,813
Because... because he wanted
to be with his family.

48
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:45,273
He should go with the girl burro.
That's a better love story.

49
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:48,983
OK, well, when you tell your burro story,
that's what he'll do.

50
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:52,993
Burro is a demeaning name.
Technically, it's called a wild ass.

51
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:57,782
Fine. The wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother.

52
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,872
See, that's why I called it a burro.

53
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:06,962
Could the burro have a grazing problem?
Then he'd be more relatable.

54
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:09,552
- Boring.
- It's not believable.

55
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:12,172
- Do burros eat their young?
- It's not a good ending.

56
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:14,592
Sometimes I throw up.

57
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:19,682
They lived happily ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.

58
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:23,682
One big, happy family.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

59
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:26,442
Where's your big, happy family?

60
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:35,491
Then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky little kids.

61
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:39,951
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?

62
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,581
- I thought...
- Story time's over. The end.

63
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:45,961
- Run for your lives!
- Where's everybody going?

64
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,130
- The world's coming to an end.
- What are you talking about?

65
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,510
Fast Tony - he says
the world's gonna flood.

66
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,300
Folks, I hold in my hand
a device so powerful,

67
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,721
it can actually pull air
right out of the sky.

68
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:58,801
Yeah, right.

69
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:01,261
Gather round, gather round.

70
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:03,851
Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am?

71
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,480
So you can't breathe underwater?

72
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,900
My assistant here will demonstrate.

73
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,440
Hey, I can smell the ocean.

74
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,780
What are you doing?
I can't sell that now.

75
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,780
You suck air through your mouth,
you moron.

76
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,990
Through its design
and sturdy construction,

77
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,119
you'll have plenty of air
for eons to come.

78
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:26,909
Of course, results may vary.

79
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:31,039
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?

80
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,959
I'm trying to make a living here, pal.

81
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,549
It's my weather forecast. The five-day
outlook calls for intense flooding

82
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,219
followed by the end of the world.

83
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,099
And a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week.

84
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,979
Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape.

85
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,649
Are you making an offer?
I mean, no, I would not.

86
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:58,279
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting.

87
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,698
You see this ground,
it's covered in ice.

88
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:03,198
A thousand years ago,
it was covered in ice.

89
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,038
A thousand years from now,
it will still be ice.

90
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:10,458
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing,

91
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:13,838
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?

92
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:18,007
- What are you talking about?
- About you being the last of your kind.

93
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,927
Your breath smells like ants.

94
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:28,388
Be that as it may, when's the last time
you saw another mammoth?

95
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:31,478
Don't pay any attention to him.

96
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:34,568
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.

97
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:36,607
What about the dinosaurs?

98
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:39,027
The dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies.

99
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:42,407
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.

100
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:45,537
Please tell me that's not our idiot.

101
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:50,867
OK, I'm gonna jump
on the count of three.

102
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,086
One,

103
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:55,996
two...

104
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:59,546
Sid, don't move a muscle.
We're coming up.

105
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:01,376
Jump! Jump! Jump!

106
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:03,586
Jump! Jump! Jump!

107
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:05,176
Sorry.

108
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:09,017
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...

109
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:11,766
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.

110
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:14,766
No. I'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator

111
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:18,226
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.

112
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:21,486
The only respect you'll get
is respect for the dead.

113
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:24,566
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.

114
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:29,075
- But I've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!

115
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:34,575
Hey, watch it.

116
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:45,425
I can't breathe.
I think I just coughed up my spleen.

117
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:04,604
- Diego, retract the claws, please.
- Right. Sorry.

118
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:09,114
If I didn't know you better, Diego,
I'd think you were afraid of the water.

119
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:11,744
OK, OK. Good thing I know you better.

120
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:13,454
Guys.

121
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,704
Fast Tony was right.

122
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:19,454
Everything is melting.

123
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:48,403
It's all gonna flood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.

124
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:51,403
Maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures.

125
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:55,613
- That's genius, Sid.
- Call me Squid.

126
00:11:56,953 --> 00:12:02,372
This whole thing's a piece ofjunk.
I can't believe I live here.

127
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,372
What?

128
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:15,971
Forget reeds. I present you with this
revolutionary gizmo we call bark.

129
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:21,392
- It's so buoyant, it actually floats.
- I'll show you something that floats.

130
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,562
All right, it's your funeral.

131
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:36,861
See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

132
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:40,911
Giants balls of furry lava the size of
mammoths raining from the sky.

133
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:43,751
Go suck air through a reed.

134
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,211
Listen to him.
He's right about the flood.

135
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:49,381
I am? I mean, yes, I am.

136
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:54,050
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a flood. Why should we listen to you?

137
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,180
Because we saw what's up there.
The dam's gonna break.

138
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
The entire valley's gonna flood.

139
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:06,391
Flood's real, all right.
And it's coming fast.

140
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,560
Look around. You're in a bowl.

141
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,860
BowI's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.

142
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,900
What are we gonna do?

143
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,570
Unless you make it
to the end of the valley.

144
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,410
There's a boat. It can save you.

145
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,450
- I don't see anything.
- But

146
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,869
y'all better hurry.

147
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,459
Ground's melting,
walls tumbling, rocks crumbling.

148
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:36,549
Survive that
and you'll be racing the water,

149
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:40,969
cos in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fields.

150
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:43,049
Boom!

151
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,719
There is some good news, though.

152
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,849
The more of you die,

153
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:50,939
the better I eat.

154
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:55,729
I didn't say it was good news for you.

155
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:02,658
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class.

156
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:28,347
Dam.

157
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:33,188
All right, you heard the scary vulture.
Let's move out.

158
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:35,768
Manny, you really think there's a boat?

159
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:39,487
I don't know, but in a few days,
this place is gonna be underwater.

160
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:42,567
If there's any hope, it's that way.

161
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:05,386
Manny, let's go.

162
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:29,116
Overturned glyptodont
in the far right lane.

163
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:31,695
Traffic backed up
as far as the eye can see.

164
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:35,325
And it looks like
there might be a fatality.

165
00:15:35,415 --> 00:15:37,375
I call the dark meat.

166
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:43,585
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.

167
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:48,005
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.

168
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:54,094
Well, I'm not leaving. I was born
in this hole and I'll die in this hole.

169
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:03,605
Do we have to bring this crap?

170
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:09,024
- I'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.

171
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:11,154
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.

172
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:14,034
Manny,
I just heard you're going extinct.

173
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:18,034
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.

174
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:23,624
- I'm not going extinct.
- Kids, look. The last mammoth.

175
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:28,713
Well, you probably won't see
another one of those again.

176
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:30,043
See?

177
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:33,763
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?

178
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,632
Stu. Come on, Stu.

179
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:17,472
Let's blow this ice-cube stand.

180
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:20,601
Stu.

181
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:31,442
Folks, be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home.

182
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:47,447
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.

183
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:54,867
Stop singing, Sid.

184
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:03,716
Sid, I'm going to fall on you again
and this time I will kill you.

185
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:07,006
OK, someone doesn't like the classics.

186
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,815
What if you're right?

187
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:21,896
What if I am the last mammoth?

188
00:20:21,976 --> 00:20:25,276
But Manny, look at the bright side,
you have us.

189
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:28,736
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.

190
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:35,455
- Mammoths?
- I knew I couldn't be the last one.

191
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,035
I felt it in my gut.

192
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,715
Extinct? Come on.

193
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:58,394
He's up by a couple of fifths,
ahead by a tusk.

194
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:02,434
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.

195
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:13,154
Sorry. My stomach hates me.

196
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:19,574
Well, don't that put
the "stink" in extinction?

197
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,294
Nasty.

198
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,124
Manny.

199
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:31,543
I need to be alone for a while.

200
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,423
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.

201
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,313
One truly is the loneliest number.

202
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:50,103
These work great.

203
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:52,773
Cool.

204
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:57,783
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- I'll get 'em.

205
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:02,083
- Which end is up?
- I'd hide that face too.

206
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:06,002
- Hey, ugly.
- I gotta sit on that.

207
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:12,252
Gotcha.

208
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:20,932
OK, I'm going in.

209
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:24,141
- Sid.
- What?

210
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:26,021
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.

211
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:28,981
- I felt some breeze in that one.
- Smile.

212
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:36,322
- Out of my way.
- Hello.

213
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:38,862
Over here.

214
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:42,241
- Surrender?
- Never.

215
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,031
Cool.

216
00:22:44,701 --> 00:22:46,201
Smoke them.

217
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:58,260
If anyone asks, there were 50 of 'em
and they were rattlesnakes.

218
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,970
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.

219
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,550
Miscreants?

220
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,930
Diego, they're possums.

221
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,350
Retreat.

222
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:40,969
I guess it's just you and me now.

223
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:55,768
I knew it.
I knew I wasn't the only one.

224
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:59,979
Everyone falls out of the tree now
and then. They just don't admit it.

225
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:01,649
Wait. What?

226
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,409
Some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches.

227
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:08,578
It's not like we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.

228
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:12,868
And you were in the tree because...?

229
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:16,378
I was looking for my brothers.
They are always in trouble.

230
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,998
Brothers? You mean there's more?

231
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:21,088
Sure.

232
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,968
- There's lots of us.
- Where?

233
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,177
Everywhere.
Under rocks. In holes in the ground.

234
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:31,467
Usually we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.

235
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,727
Help! Help!

236
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,807
Help!

237
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:44,357
Well, shave me down and call me
a mole rat. You found another mammoth.

238
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:48,157
Where? Wait a minute.
I thought mammoths were extinct.

239
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:54,577
- What are you looking at me for?
- I don't know. Because you're a mammoth.

240
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:59,207
Me? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not a mammoth. I'm a possum.

241
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:03,296
Right. Good one. I'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.

242
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,426
And my other friend, the platypus.

243
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:09,176
Why do I gotta be the platypus?
Make him the platypus.

244
00:25:09,256 --> 00:25:12,556
- This guy giving you trouble, sis?
- Sis?

245
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:17,726
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.

246
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:22,855
I don't think her tree
goes all the way to the top branch.

247
00:25:24,185 --> 00:25:27,196
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.

248
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,486
Hey, she should come with us.

249
00:25:29,566 --> 00:25:32,156
Are you insane? No way.

250
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:33,786
OK.

251
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,955
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.

252
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:41,495
- I'd rather be road kill.
- That can be arranged.

253
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:46,165
Funny. Let me have a little word
with my brothers.

254
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:49,255
Ellie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.

255
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:52,675
Look, we'll never make it in time
if we only travel at night.

256
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:57,184
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?

257
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:00,094
Why did you invite them?

258
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,394
Cos you might be
the only two mammoths left on Earth.

259
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:04,774
He has a point.

260
00:26:04,774 --> 00:26:07,774
Sorry, when did I join
this dating service?

261
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:12,115
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you.

262
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,484
If you treat us nicely.

263
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,154
See that?
That's the total opposite of nice.

264
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,914
Maybe we'll have a snack
before we hit the road.

265
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:23,164
You want a piece of us? Let's go.

266
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:25,044
Banzai!

267
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:27,544
- I got 'em.
- Back! Back!

268
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:33,503
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.

269
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:43,013
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now travelling together.

270
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:46,813
And like it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy family.

271
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:49,732
I'll be the daddy,
Ellie will be the mommy.

272
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:53,733
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.

273
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:57,693
Now, let's move it before the ground
falls out from under our feet.

274
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,703
I thought fat guys
were supposed to be jolly.

275
00:27:00,783 --> 00:27:04,993
I'm not fat. It's this fur,
it makes me look big.

276
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,002
- It's poofy.
- OK.

277
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:10,252
He's fat.

278
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:48,581
Escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds

279
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:51,501
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.

280
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,751
You, ma'am, you look
like a big, fat, hairy beast.

281
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,841
How would you like
to lose a ton or two?

282
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:01,510
Would I ever.

283
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:06,350
Don't listen to him, Vera.
You're already thin as a twig.

284
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:11,480
I also have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my blind friend.

285
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,839
We'll never make it at this pace.

286
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,349
Ellie, it's OK, you can
lose the camouflage. You're safe.

287
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:50,309
OK. Safe? Please.

288
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:52,429
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.

289
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,728
- What you got?
- Perimeter all clear.

290
00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:59,768
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...

291
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:01,728
- Guys.
- All clear.

292
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,029
Hawk!

293
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:20,748
- What are you doing?
- Playing dead.

294
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:25,168
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because I'm a mammoth.

295
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:27,638
But you'd do it for treats, right?

296
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:30,757
Is he gone?

297
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:35,137
You're safe. Get up.

298
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:37,307
Man.

299
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:41,857
If you weren't here, that hawk would have
swooped down and snatched me for dinner.

300
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:44,607
That's how cousin Wilton went.

301
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:50,027
Boy, I really feel for you. I do.

302
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:54,407
I can't even imagine what it'd be like
to be the last one of your species.

303
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:58,957
- I'm not the last one.
- You brave, brave soul.

304
00:29:59,037 --> 00:30:02,047
That's right. Don't give up hope.

305
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:05,586
Ellie.

306
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:08,506
Look at our footprints.

307
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:10,846
They're the same shape.

308
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:14,056
Well, how do I know
those aren't your footprints?

309
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:16,176
Well, then,

310
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:18,556
look at our shadows.

311
00:30:18,636 --> 00:30:20,936
We match.

312
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:23,725
You're right. They're the same.

313
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:25,985
You must be part possum.

314
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:31,155
You wish.

315
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:47,465
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you.

316
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,545
We gotta catch up with the others.

317
00:30:58,844 --> 00:31:01,184
Hey. Knock it off.

318
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:07,524
Cry me a river, blubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.

319
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:10,774
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.

320
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:13,024
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,

321
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:18,994
but it's strong enough to hold
a ten-ton mammoth and a nine-ton possum.

322
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:43,303
Mammal overboard!

323
00:31:57,612 --> 00:32:01,363
Ellie, get up.
If you play dead, you'll be dead.

324
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,493
Look at me.

325
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:12,042
Diego.

326
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:21,422
Diego.

327
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:33,191
Come on, Diego. Come on.

328
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:37,481
This may sting a little.

329
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:45,339
- What in the animal kingdom was that?
- I don't know.

330
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,299
From now on,
land - safe, water - not safe.

331
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,268
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

332
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:01,268
- It was nothing. I...
- It's not a compliment.

333
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:03,398
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.

334
00:34:03,478 --> 00:34:06,448
- Yeah, we're spineless.
- Lily-livered.

335
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:09,948
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.

336
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:13,039
Maybe you should run away more.

337
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,408
Good point. Thanks for the advice.

338
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:17,498
Happy to help.

339
00:34:18,368 --> 00:34:22,918
Do you believe her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you should run away more".

340
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:26,088
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.

341
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:28,428
You like her.

342
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:33,057
- I do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

343
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,807
- And so is yours.
- What secret?

344
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:38,637
You know, the one where you can't swim.

345
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:40,097
That's ridiculous.

346
00:34:40,057 --> 00:34:42,517
Fine. But we're living
in a melting world.

347
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:47,107
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or later.

348
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:48,585
Almost there.

349
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:51,835
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.

350
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:53,925
Let's roll.

351
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:58,465
Wait for me.

352
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:12,984
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

353
00:36:13,064 --> 00:36:15,984
So you think she's the girl for me?

354
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:19,243
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

355
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:21,953
She completes you.

356
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:25,664
Yeah.

357
00:36:25,744 --> 00:36:30,004
Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?

358
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:32,424
- No.
- Come on.

359
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,134
You expect to impress
with that attitude?

360
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:36,634
I don't want to impress.

361
00:36:36,714 --> 00:36:39,593
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?

362
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:43,343
Because that's what she is.
I don't care if she thinks she's a possum.

363
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:47,813
- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.

364
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:50,563
Tell that to the bullfrog,
chicken hawk or turtledove.

365
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:53,023
He's never gonna let up on you.

366
00:36:53,023 --> 00:36:56,652
It'll be easier on all of us
if you just go with it.

367
00:36:58,272 --> 00:37:00,692
So what do you want me to do?

368
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,112
Pull the tree
and shoot me into the pond.

369
00:37:03,202 --> 00:37:04,822
I don't know.

370
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,743
If you're too lame to do it,
we can get Ellie.

371
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:10,543
No, no, no. No, I can do it.
I can do it.

372
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:12,582
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

373
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:16,382
- Have you done this before?
- Only a million times.

374
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:19,002
Farther, farther, farther.

375
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:22,012
Perfect. Fire!

376
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:26,552
Yeah! I can fly!

377
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,271
Crash!

378
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:44,701
Crash! Crash!

379
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:47,371
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?

380
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:50,411
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?

381
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:53,831
- He said he could do it.
- And you listened to him?

382
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:57,291
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the light.

383
00:37:57,381 --> 00:37:59,541
Can I help in any way here?

384
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:02,591
You've done enough.

385
00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:07,510
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't leave me.

386
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,970
Who's gonna watch my back?

387
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,640
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?

388
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,980
Who's gonna roll
in that dung patch with me?

389
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,020
Dung patch?

390
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:24,859
- Wait. My legs. I can stand.
- He can stand.

391
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:28,659
- I can run.
- He can run. It's a miracle.

392
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,739
Hallelujah!

393
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,999
What can I say? They're boys.
They make my life a little adventure.

394
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:45,339
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.

395
00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:47,589
Not the face.

396
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:00,648
Ellie, Ellie, me too.

397
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:02,898
She's not half bad.

398
00:39:04,148 --> 00:39:07,648
Crazy and confused, but sweet.

399
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:09,738
So?

400
00:39:11,278 --> 00:39:13,788
So what's holding you back?

401
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:18,118
My family.

402
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:24,248
You can have that again, you know.

403
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:26,508
No, Sid, I can't.

404
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,338
OK, OK, but think about it.
I mean, if you let this chance go,

405
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:36,467
you're letting your whole species go
and that's just... that's just selfish.

406
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:46,477
I think I'm starting
to get through to him.

407
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:50,697
- Wait, wait. I got you.
- Slowpoke.

408
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:58,616
- Need help?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.

409
00:39:58,706 --> 00:40:01,417
- You're stuck.
- I am not.

410
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:04,167
All right, then, let's go.

411
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:07,507
I can't.

412
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,797
I'm stuck.

413
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:14,506
Don't you think that picking them up
like this would be easier?

414
00:40:31,105 --> 00:40:32,735
Ellie?

415
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:57,635
I know this place.

416
00:43:01,501 --> 00:43:05,511
You know, deep down,
I knew I was different.

417
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:12,220
I was a little bigger
than the other possum kids.

418
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,810
OK, a lot bigger.

419
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,610
Now I understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appealing.

420
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:26,610
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,

421
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,029
- you know.
- What?

422
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:35,329
Attractive.

423
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:38,499
- Really?
- Sure.

424
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:41,830
What about me is attractive?

425
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,959
I don't know.

426
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:48,299
Well, there's your

427
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:51,839
butt.

428
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,009
What about it?

429
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,229
It's

430
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:59,559
big.

431
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,769
You're just saying that.

432
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:05,318
No, no, no, I mean it.

433
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:09,648
It's huge.
Biggest darn butt I've ever seen.

434
00:44:09,738 --> 00:44:12,698
That is really sweet.

435
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,028
What a crazy day.

436
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:20,457
This morning I woke up a possum
and now I'm a mammoth.

437
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:09,474
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap
with Ellie today.

438
00:46:09,564 --> 00:46:11,894
Sure did.

439
00:46:11,984 --> 00:46:16,774
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. Splash.

440
00:46:16,854 --> 00:46:20,324
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.

441
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:23,614
I wouldn't know.
Sabres don't feel fear.

442
00:46:23,704 --> 00:46:28,243
Come on, all animals feel fear.
It's what separates us from, say, rocks.

443
00:46:28,323 --> 00:46:30,833
Rocks have no fear.

444
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,413
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?

445
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:39,384
It may surprise you to know
that I, too, have experienced fear.

446
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,254
No. You?

447
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:43,883
Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems,

448
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:49,643
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise "kill" us.

449
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,473
- I wonder why?
- Jealousy, mostly.

450
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:55,523
But the point is that fear is natural.

451
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,193
Fear is for prey.

452
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:02,982
Well, then, you're letting
the water make you its prey.

453
00:47:03,072 --> 00:47:06,992
Justjump in and trust your instincts.

454
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:09,782
You know, most animals
can swim as babies.

455
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:15,872
And for a tiger, it's like crawling
on your belly to stalk helpless prey.

456
00:47:16,582 --> 00:47:21,042
But faster, OK?
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick.

457
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:24,132
I'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick.

458
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:27,132
I look back over my shoulder
to see if I'm being followed.

459
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:29,552
And I'm breathing.

460
00:47:29,642 --> 00:47:33,062
And I'm stalking
and I'm stalking and I'm...

461
00:47:34,472 --> 00:47:38,851
- I'm falling.
- Correction. You're sinking.

462
00:47:38,941 --> 00:47:41,441
Kind of like a rock.

463
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:49,031
Hey, do we do any special tricks
like roll over?

464
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:52,201
Or do we just throw our weight around?

465
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:54,041
Whoops. Sorry.

466
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,700
I don't know my own strength yet.

467
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:01,170
Ellie, do you realise that now
we have a chance to save our species?

468
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,921
- Really? How are we gonna do that?
- Well, you know...

469
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:07,881
Did you just...?

470
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:11,801
I'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?

471
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:15,600
I wasn't saying...
Not right now. In time.

472
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,310
I was just saying that
it's our responsibility.

473
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,690
What?

474
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,560
All right, that came out wrong. I...

475
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,730
You're very pretty, but we just met...

476
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,190
Responsibility?
Just doing your duty? Is that it?

477
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,279
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species.

478
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:38,119
I got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.

479
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:51,969
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.

480
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:59,889
OK, let's go.
We travelled with you all day,

481
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:02,559
now you're coming with us at night.

482
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,809
But we can't see at night.

483
00:49:04,899 --> 00:49:07,108
Then enjoy the flood.

484
00:49:07,188 --> 00:49:09,898
I can't even look at him.

485
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,988
Pervert.

486
00:49:16,738 --> 00:49:21,748
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.

487
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:49,067
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.

488
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:53,397
I thought we could walk together.

489
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:56,117
Crash,
ask the mammoth why he thinks that.

490
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:59,486
She said she thinks you're ajerk
and to go away.

491
00:49:59,576 --> 00:50:01,576
She didn't say...

492
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:05,496
Look, maybe if we spend more time...

493
00:50:05,576 --> 00:50:09,586
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right now.

494
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:14,587
- She said go jump in a lake.
- And possums rule.

495
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:17,676
- I can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medal?

496
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:31,606
Stop moving.

497
00:50:34,855 --> 00:50:36,775
Thank you.

498
00:50:44,495 --> 00:50:46,575
Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks.

499
00:50:49,415 --> 00:50:51,495
Now!

500
00:50:55,924 --> 00:50:59,465
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge.

501
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:08,395
- Funny. Now what's your real plan?
- Just do it.

502
00:51:08,475 --> 00:51:10,514
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.

503
00:51:10,604 --> 00:51:12,934
- Bye, Ellie.
- Go now.

504
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:21,074
I'm sorry if what I said before
offended you.

505
00:51:21,154 --> 00:51:23,694
What do you mean "if" it offended me?

506
00:51:24,994 --> 00:51:27,414
That it offended her!

507
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:30,333
I mean that, that it offended you.

508
00:51:34,203 --> 00:51:36,873
- You just overreacted, that's all.
- What?

509
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:39,833
- Take it back.
- There are other lives at stake here.

510
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:42,214
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.

511
00:51:42,304 --> 00:51:45,174
- It was a misunderstanding.
- It was insensitive.

512
00:51:45,264 --> 00:51:48,053
- Apologise.
- Why me? She overreacted.

513
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:50,393
- Just apologise.
- No.

514
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:53,393
- Do it.
- OK, I'm sorry.

515
00:51:53,473 --> 00:51:54,933
What?

516
00:51:55,023 --> 00:51:57,523
- He's right. I overreacted.
- You mean...

517
00:51:57,603 --> 00:52:02,193
Not another word or I'll come down there
and push you over myself.

518
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,492
I got it. I got it.

519
00:52:05,572 --> 00:52:07,572
I got it.

520
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:15,752
Manny, Ellie, run! Run!

521
00:52:28,552 --> 00:52:32,102
I guess we finally
did something right together.

522
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:37,232
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here.

523
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,330
- Remember the good old days?
- Which good old days?

524
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,920
You know. Yesterday, last week.

525
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,471
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.

526
00:53:09,551 --> 00:53:12,091
Yep. Those were the good days.

527
00:53:12,181 --> 00:53:16,640
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.

528
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,180
- We should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

529
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:24,270
Tomorrow's the day
the vulture said we're all going to die.

530
00:54:38,928 --> 00:54:41,348
Wait a minute.

531
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:43,938
Can I help you?

532
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:57,567
Now, that's what I call respect.

533
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:01,157
Nice.

534
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:10,336
Somebody here likes Sid.

535
00:55:10,876 --> 00:55:14,876
Who is your decorator?
I mean, this is fabulous.

536
00:55:19,926 --> 00:55:22,556
Fire King.

537
00:55:28,516 --> 00:55:34,396
Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time
someone recognised my true potential.

538
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:36,646
Let there be fire.

539
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:49,183
If only the guys could see me now.

540
00:56:50,803 --> 00:56:54,103
This is either really good
or really bad.

541
00:56:56,103 --> 00:56:57,273
No, no, no.

542
00:56:57,353 --> 00:56:59,943
Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King?

543
00:56:59,893 --> 00:57:03,313
A thousand years' bad juju
for killing Fire King.

544
00:57:03,403 --> 00:57:06,443
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,

545
00:57:06,533 --> 00:57:08,862
melting ice built up
over thousands of years.

546
00:57:08,952 --> 00:57:13,032
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can look for a solution.

547
00:57:13,122 --> 00:57:15,742
We have one - sacrifice the Fire King.

548
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:18,792
- Well, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.

549
00:57:19,622 --> 00:57:21,622
No! No!

550
00:57:37,722 --> 00:57:40,062
Bad juju!

551
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,790
Water? Water!

552
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,300
Crash, I told you not to drink
before bed.

553
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,141
I didn't do this.
At least, not all of it.

554
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:18,640
- What's happening?
- We overslept. We need to move.

555
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,020
What if we're the last creatures
left alive?

556
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,310
We'll have to repopulate the Earth.

557
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:26,730
How? Everyone's either
a dude or our sister.

558
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,530
Hi. Hey, Manny.

559
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,570
Wow. What a night.
You'll never guess what happened.

560
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,119
You were sleepwalking.

561
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:39,789
No, no, no. I was kidnapped
by a tribe of mini sloths.

562
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:43,159
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.

563
00:58:43,249 --> 00:58:47,459
I mean, sure, they tossed me into a
flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.

564
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:51,549
You were dreaming. Come on, the water's
rising faster than we're moving.

565
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:56,798
I'm telling you, I was kidnapped.
I was worshiped. Guys.

566
00:58:56,888 --> 00:58:58,889
Fine.

567
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:09,609
Can we slow down a little?
I'm dying here.

568
00:59:13,698 --> 00:59:16,158
It was just a figure of speech.

569
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:24,998
They just sit there, watching us.

570
00:59:25,078 --> 00:59:27,918
I wish I knew what they were thinking.

571
01:01:01,134 --> 01:01:04,004
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.

572
01:01:09,554 --> 01:01:12,435
- Sid!
- What? It's catchy.

573
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:28,534
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.

574
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:58,933
It's just a little hot water and steam.
How bad could it be?

575
01:02:05,523 --> 01:02:09,403
I just did something
involuntary and messy.

576
01:02:10,452 --> 01:02:12,452
OK, come on.

577
01:02:13,492 --> 01:02:16,162
Manny. Get back.
It's a minefield out there.

578
01:02:16,242 --> 01:02:19,202
There's only one way to go.
Straight through.

579
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:23,252
Straight through? We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.

580
01:02:23,332 --> 01:02:26,632
- We'll head back and go around.
- There's no time.

581
01:02:26,712 --> 01:02:29,381
The dam will burst before we make it.
We'll drown.

582
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:31,931
If we go through this,
we get blown to bits.

583
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:33,931
- We go forward.
- We go back.

584
01:02:34,011 --> 01:02:36,511
- Forward.
- Back.

585
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:38,852
- Can I say something?
- No.

586
01:02:38,932 --> 01:02:43,812
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- Well, I guess that proves it.

587
01:02:43,902 --> 01:02:45,901
I am a mammoth.

588
01:02:47,441 --> 01:02:50,691
- Come on.
- Fine.

589
01:02:50,781 --> 01:02:54,161
I don't know. Drowning sounds like
a much gentler way to go.

590
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:57,831
Blown to bits sounds so sudden.

591
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,590
He's going to get himself killed.
Manny, wait.

592
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,420
Manny.

593
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,159
Kids, look, the last mammoth.

594
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:41,579
I just heard you're going extinct.

595
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:45,289
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're ajerk.

596
01:03:45,369 --> 01:03:48,129
Where's your big, happy family?

597
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:50,799
What's wrong with you?

598
01:03:50,879 --> 01:03:53,299
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!

599
01:04:00,558 --> 01:04:02,058
That way.

600
01:04:41,717 --> 01:04:47,727
Do not leave your children unattended.
All unattended children will be eaten.

601
01:04:51,897 --> 01:04:53,897
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.

602
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,107
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No.

603
01:04:56,187 --> 01:04:59,317
Possum? About 11 foot tall?

604
01:05:00,987 --> 01:05:04,367
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- I sure have. Big as life.

605
01:05:04,447 --> 01:05:06,537
- Where?
- I'm looking at him.

606
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:08,866
Not me.

607
01:05:08,956 --> 01:05:11,126
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.

608
01:06:10,684 --> 01:06:15,564
- I don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's already on board.

609
01:06:28,534 --> 01:06:30,534
Hurry, this way. Come on.

610
01:06:32,824 --> 01:06:36,494
- There it is.
- Ellie! Help!

611
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:47,803
Come on, come on, run!

612
01:06:53,893 --> 01:06:55,892
Push.

613
01:06:58,602 --> 01:07:02,023
- You guys gotta go.
- We're not leaving you.

614
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:04,563
- I'm not asking.
- Ellie, no.

615
01:07:07,113 --> 01:07:09,823
Ellie, don't worry.
We're going for help.

616
01:07:09,903 --> 01:07:11,743
Stay here.

617
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:30,172
- Help us.
- Help! Somebody help.

618
01:07:30,262 --> 01:07:32,341
Manny.

619
01:07:32,551 --> 01:07:34,721
Manny.

620
01:07:38,431 --> 01:07:41,601
- Manny.
- It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.

621
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:43,699
Ellie.

622
01:08:43,789 --> 01:08:45,789
Manny.

623
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:52,339
- Help!
- I'll save you.

624
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,049
Great. Who's gonna save him?

625
01:09:01,678 --> 01:09:03,808
You really need to brush.

626
01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:12,689
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.

627
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:16,489
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.

628
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:20,488
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

629
01:09:20,568 --> 01:09:22,948
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.

630
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:25,158
I am not your prey. I am not your prey.

631
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:27,658
I am not your prey.

632
01:09:50,727 --> 01:09:53,226
Attack the water. Stalking the prey.

633
01:09:53,306 --> 01:09:56,857
Claw, kick. Even babies can do it.
Come on.

634
01:09:56,937 --> 01:10:00,947
Claw, kick, claw, kick.

635
01:10:01,027 --> 01:10:04,157
Hey. I'm stalking the prey.

636
01:10:10,037 --> 01:10:12,036
Eddie.

637
01:10:25,716 --> 01:10:29,675
You did it, buddy.
You kicked water's butt.

638
01:10:29,765 --> 01:10:33,185
Nothing to it. Most animals
can swim as babies, you know.

639
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:36,515
Yeah, but not tigers.
I left that part out.

640
01:10:51,785 --> 01:10:54,745
There he is.

641
01:10:54,825 --> 01:10:57,245
Ellie, hold on to me.

642
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:31,574
Manny, Manny, behind you.

643
01:12:08,563 --> 01:12:10,573
There they are.

644
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:13,743
They made it.

645
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:27,292
We thought we'd never see you again.

646
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:38,801
We're gonna live.

647
01:12:42,431 --> 01:12:45,351
We're gonna die.

648
01:14:39,127 --> 01:14:40,927
Well, I'm not leaving.

649
01:14:40,877 --> 01:14:43,927
Grandpa, let go of the boat.
The flood's over.

650
01:14:44,007 --> 01:14:48,977
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

651
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:53,147
Stu. We made it. We're gonna live.

652
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:55,517
Well, I am anyway.

653
01:14:58,066 --> 01:15:00,987
I'm thinking about starting
a swim school.

654
01:15:01,067 --> 01:15:03,527
Sid's Squids.

655
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:11,617
All hail Fire King.

656
01:15:16,836 --> 01:15:18,626
Hi.

657
01:15:22,676 --> 01:15:28,346
Fire King avert flood.
Join us, O great and noble flaming one.

658
01:15:31,635 --> 01:15:35,805
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quality offer.

659
01:15:35,895 --> 01:15:41,485
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.

660
01:15:41,985 --> 01:15:48,236
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that holds us together.

661
01:15:49,366 --> 01:15:55,205
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.

662
01:15:55,285 --> 01:15:58,915
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.

663
01:15:58,995 --> 01:16:01,915
That doesn't mean "want to touch".

664
01:16:07,544 --> 01:16:09,674
Don't ask.

665
01:17:10,022 --> 01:17:13,113
We're not the last ones anymore.

666
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:20,032
You're not coming?

667
01:17:20,122 --> 01:17:22,372
You wanna go with them?

668
01:17:22,452 --> 01:17:24,622
I am a mammoth.

669
01:17:24,702 --> 01:17:27,332
I should probably be with a mammoth.

670
01:17:27,422 --> 01:17:29,922
Don't you think?

671
01:17:30,002 --> 01:17:32,002
Yeah, unless...

672
01:17:33,802 --> 01:17:35,802
Unless?

673
01:17:37,341 --> 01:17:39,681
Unless I...

674
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:44,971
I just wanna say...

675
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:48,231
I need to tell you...

676
01:17:50,021 --> 01:17:53,941
I hope you find everything
you're looking for.

677
01:17:57,321 --> 01:17:59,321
You too.

678
01:18:33,649 --> 01:18:39,530
Manny, you've come a long way since we
met and I'll take full credit for that,

679
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:44,620
but you need to let go of the past
so you can have a future.

680
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:51,619
- Go after her.
- It's OK.

681
01:18:52,539 --> 01:18:54,789
We'll always be here for you.

682
01:18:55,499 --> 01:18:59,339
- I'll keep in touch.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.

683
01:18:59,419 --> 01:19:02,089
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.

684
01:19:08,308 --> 01:19:11,348
Our Manny's growing up.

685
01:19:11,938 --> 01:19:14,858
Ellie! Ellie!

686
01:19:19,148 --> 01:19:21,148
Manny.

687
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:26,698
Ellie, I don't want us
to be together because we have to.

688
01:19:26,778 --> 01:19:29,408
I want us to be together
because we want to.

689
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,658
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.

690
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:38,128
- What do you say?
- Manny, I thought you were going...

691
01:19:42,127 --> 01:19:44,547
You're possum enough for me.

692
01:19:58,777 --> 01:20:04,656
Well, it's just you and me now.
Two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

693
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,407
Fine. But I'm not gonna carry you.

694
01:20:07,487 --> 01:20:12,207
- I still have my pride, you know.
- Come on, buddy, for old time's sake.

695
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,787
I'll carry him.

696
01:20:16,327 --> 01:20:19,246
- But your herd's leaving.
- We are now.

697
01:20:19,336 --> 01:20:20,796
Shotgun!

698
01:20:23,046 --> 01:20:25,756
Manny, who do you like better?
Me or Diego?

699
01:20:25,836 --> 01:20:29,136
- Diego. It's not even close.
- Told you.

700
01:20:29,216 --> 01:20:32,136
Manny, you can't choose
between your kids.

701
01:20:32,226 --> 01:20:35,265
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.

702
01:20:35,345 --> 01:20:37,975
If I had a dog and my dog had a kid...

703
01:20:37,975 --> 01:20:40,605
and the dog's kid had a pet,
that would be Sid.

704
01:20:40,685 --> 01:20:43,275
- Can I have a dog, Manny?
- No.

705
01:20:43,355 --> 01:20:46,275
- Ellie, can I have a dog?
- Of course you can, sweetie.

706
01:20:46,355 --> 01:20:49,865
Ellie,
we have to be consistent with him.

707
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:11,461
I saved you, little buddy.

708
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:27,890
Calm down.
I saved you, little buddy. Remember?

709
