00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:02,295
Do you have a name?

159
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,614
My name is Cornelius.

160
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:10,617
This is my wife Zira.

161
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:14,020
And I'm Lewis.
Lewis Dixon.

162
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,061
Nobody's going to believe this.

163
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,460
Believe what?

164
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,330
- That primitive apes can talk.
- Primitive?

165
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:25,897
Uh...well, I mean
that in our, um...

166
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:30,107
primitive, um, civilization,
apes just don't talk.

167
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,117
I mean, I think
it's important that when

168
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:35,587
our primitive security
precautions are lifted,

169
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:38,650
that the first time
you say anything in public,

170
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:41,493
you should talk
to what we primitively call

171
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,831
the right people.

172
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:49,106
May I say something...

173
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:51,112
personal?

174
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,115
Please.

175
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:55,084
I like you.

176
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,792
I have from the beginning.

[Murmuring]

178
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:19,278
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- All: Mr. President.

179
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:23,192
I'm aware that what I have to
tell you may conceivably create

180
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:25,823
- somewhat wider than the Grand Canyon.
- [Laughing]

181
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:29,632
Nonetheless, it is true.
Yesterday, a U.S. spacecraft

182
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:32,938
splashed down off
the Southern California coast.

183
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,979
It was one of two that
have been missing in space

184
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:37,015
for over 2 years now.

185
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,077
To be exact, the one commanded
by Colonel Taylor.

186
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:41,713
[Murmuring]

187
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,021
Have they identified the bodies,
Mr. President?

188
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:49,090
They have identified
3 bodies, yes, all living.

189
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,999
[Murmuring]

190
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,667
At the time of their rescue,
through an unfortunate accident

191
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:57,805
one of them was killed early
this morning in the Los Angeles Zoo.

192
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,248
- Zoo?
- What would astronauts

193
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:02,549
be doing in a zoo,
Mr. President?

194
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:06,525
They are not astronauts,
General Faulkner.

195
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:09,064
- They are apes.
- [Murmuring]

196
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:11,067
Chimpanzees,
to be more precise.

197
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:13,832
They're harmless, friendly,
and by all reports

198
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,467
extremely intelligent
and sophisticated creatures.

199
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,478
But naturally, being animals,

200
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:21,744
they cannot tell us
where the ship came from

201
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:24,151
or how they
came to be in it.

202
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,315
I have, therefore,
decided to convene

203
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:29,828
a Presidential Commission of lnquiry
in Los Angeles tomorrow.

204
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,458
The 2 surviving apes

205
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:35,504
will be presented to the commission
for their inspection.

206
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:38,974
The press will be invited to attend,
not to participate.

207
00:21:39,043 --> 00:21:42,173
I don't believe
that we can withhold

208
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:47,187
this extraordinary discovery
from the world any longer.

One of the 2
American spaceships

believed until now to have
disintegrated in orbit,

splashed down unexpectedly yesterday
in the Pacific Ocean

off the coast
ofSouthern California.

And is stated
to have been manned--

if you can call it manned--
by monkeys.

Reporters:
General!

219
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:27,716
No comment.
I have nothing to say, gentlemen.

00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:29,879
- Reporters: Senator!
- I'm sorry , boys, not now.

00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:32,048
I haven't the time now.
A little later, please.

Reporter:
Here comes the chairman.

Later. Later.

224
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,503
As the president's
senior science advisor,

225
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:46,375
what do you expect to experience
from this historic meeting?

226
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:49,440
- Fear.
- [All Talking At Once]

227
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:57,160
All right now,
after I break the news,

228
00:22:57,229 --> 00:23:00,028
I want you to start slowly
with simple answers to what will

229
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,296
certainly be
simple questions.

230
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:05,135
And if the questions
become less simple?

231
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:09,340
- Be yourself.
- Your better self, Zira.

232
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:12,476
- Please.
- [Knock]

233
00:23:12,552 --> 00:23:14,487
All right, it's time.

234
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,193
What do they think
we are, gorillas?

235
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:21,390
I'm sorry .

236
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,716
That's it.
Just be seated.

Uh, Mr. Chairman,
members of the commission,

238
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,664
Iadies and gentlemen,
my name is Lewis Dixon.

239
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:46,935
And I am
the animal psychiatrist

240
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,477
who has been in charge
of these 2 apes

241
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:51,844
since they came to
the Los Angeles Zoo.

242

My associate,
Dr. Stephanie Branton

243
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,016
and I are ready
to answer your questions.

244
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,550
What may astonish you
is that, um,

245
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:02,621
our chimpanzee friends

246
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:05,965
are ready to answer
your questions too.

247
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:08,734
Not by signs, not by looks,
or movements,

248
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:11,369
but by words.

249

[Gavel Strikes Bench]

251
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:20,721
Dr. Dixon, as a zoologist,
I know and respect your work,

252
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,388
but if you think you're going to turn
a presidential inquiry

253
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,990
into a ventriloquist's act,
I have to inform you--

254
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,002
And I have to inform you, sir,
that these two apes

255
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,005
have acquired
the power ofspeech.

256
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:32,304
Come now, Doctor,
you know as well as I do

257
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:34,312
their brain system
is not developed

258
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,180
in either the vocal or
abstract thinking area.

259
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:39,618
Yes, sir, but I repeat
that they have the power ofspeech.

260
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:43,251
And it is for you gentlemen
to assess how far that power

261
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:45,262
can be exercised intelligently.

262
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,166
Well, may we be told which
is the female of the species?

263
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,574
Did she rise as a reflex
to you having indicated her,

264
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:58,616
or in answer to my question?

265
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:01,176
That's for you to decide.

266
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,323
- Have you a name?
- Zira.

267

[Crowd Gasps]

268
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:10,333
Certainly she can articulate,

269
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:13,030
which, in itself,
is extraordinary !

270
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:16,634
Uh, but, Dr. Dixon, are we
to infer that Zira is her name

271
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:18,976
or some phrase
in her language?

272
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:20,982
Infer what you will,
Mr. Chairman.

273
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,315
I suggest you
rephrase the question.

274
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,860
What is your name?

275
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:30,898
Zi-ra!

276
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:35,237
One might as well
be talking to a parrot.

277
00:25:35,306 --> 00:25:37,571
A parrot!

Mechanical mimicry . Unique in
an ape vocally, without a doubt,

00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:47,414
but, uh, does
the other one talk?

280
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:52,525
Only when she lets me.

- Dr. Hasslein?

- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes?

- What is the male's name, please?
- Cornelius.

- My lawfully wedded spouse.
- Wedded?

We'll take that up later,
Your Eminence.

Cornelius, do you and
your lawfully wedded spouse

288
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:28,811
speak any language
other than English?

What is English?

290
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,386
I speak the language
taught to me

291
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:37,024
by my father and mother,
who were taught by their

292
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,092
It has been the language
ofour ancestors

293
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:41,138
for nearly 2,000 years.

294
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:43,937
As to its origins,
who can be sure?

295
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,743
Gorillas and orangutans
ofour community believe

296
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,877
that God created the ape
in his own image.

297
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:54,722
Nonsense!

298
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:57,592
Cornelius, as an intellectual,
you know damned well

299
00:26:57,663 --> 00:27:00,361
the gorillas are a bunch
ofmilitaristic nincompoops.

300
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,529
And the orangutans are
a bunch ofblinkered,

301
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:05,006
pseudoscientific geese!

302
00:27:08,547 --> 00:27:10,948
As to humans, I've dissect--

303
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:13,954
I've examined thousands of them.

304
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:18,222
And until now, I've only discovered
2 who could talk in my life.

305
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:21,129
God knows who taught them.

306
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,135
Where we come from,

307
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:25,729
apes talk.

308
00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:27,742
Humans are dumb.

309
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,018
Where do you come from,
Cornelius?

310
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:39,892
I'm not sure.

311
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:41,862
Dr. Milo was sure.

312
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:46,970
Dr. Milo was a genius
well in advance ofhis time.

313
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,477
When the spacecraft
first landed on our seaboard,

314
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,479
it was Dr. Milo who salvaged it.

315
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:56,041
He studied it
and halfunderstood it.

316
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,749
Half?
Was halfenough?

317
00:27:58,823 --> 00:28:02,022
It was enough for us to escape
when war became inevitable.

318
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:05,088
Enough for Dr. Milo
to be murdered in your zoo.

319
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:07,568
Enough for my wife and I
to be here now.

320
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:11,905
- From where, Cornelius?
- I told you, I'm not sure.

321
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:14,776
Maybe the female knows.

322
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:17,647
Of course the female knows!

323
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,847
We came from your future!

324
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:30,361
That doesn't make any sense.

325
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:32,372
It's the only thing that does.

326
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,104
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes?

327
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:39,709
Cornelius, you spoke ofwar.

328
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:43,951
- War between whom?
- The gorillas and whoever lives--Iived.

329
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:46,928
- Will live.
- Who won the war?

330
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:51,628
I don't know. Chimpanzees are pacifists.
We stayed at home.

331
00:28:51,703 --> 00:28:55,300
- But you left before the war had ended.
- In a spaceship.

332
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,312
- Which Dr. Milo learned to navigate.
- Correct.

333
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,409
Cornelius.
Did you know Colonel Taylor?

334
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,327
No. Is he a soldier?

335
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,767
We are peaceful creatures.

336
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,804
We are happy to be here.

337
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:17,000
May we be unchained?

338
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:34,563
Here they come.
Gentlemen, do you have--

339
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,571
No comment.
No comment.

340
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:40,600
- No comment.
- No comment.

341
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,341
- Mr. Chairman, a word.
- I'll give you one-- preposterous.

342
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:46,716
- Well, can you define that,
Mr. Chairman?

343
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,621
As head of this commission,
it will be our duty to sit through

344
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:52,594
the facts of this bizarre affair
and pass our conclusions

345
00:29:52,663 --> 00:29:56,396
onto the president of the United States
for implementation.

346
00:29:56,468 --> 00:30:00,770
- What a load ofhogger mogger.
- Dr. Hasslein.

347
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,106
- No comment, please.
- How will you advise the president

348
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:05,113
to handle this
unique situation?

349
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:07,344
- No comment.
- All right then, Dr. Hasslein,

350
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:09,684
could you tell us how you
personally would handle it?

351
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:13,989
No, gentlemen,
no comment...yet.

352
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,655
Doctor.

353
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,666
You were fabulous!

354
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:20,067
You were marvelous.
They loved you. All that applause.

355
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:22,333
But there was a moment--

356
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:25,037
There was when he
started to ask us--

357
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:27,240
Zira!

358
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:30,912
-Cornelius, I think we should tell them.
-No.

359
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:35,426
- But only to Lewis and Stevie.
- Oh, Zira.

360
00:30:35,494 --> 00:30:38,488
I have to be honest
with someone.

361
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:40,398
Cornelius, please.

362
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:42,938
You tell them.

363
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,243
Well, you see...

364
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:51,250
we did know Colonel Taylor.

365
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,788
We came to love him.

366
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:56,849
I don't understand what harm there could
be in telling that to the commission?

367
00:30:56,926 --> 00:31:00,659
Where we come from,

368
00:31:00,732 --> 00:31:04,033
apes did not love humans.

369
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:07,542
They, uh, hunted them
for sport,

370
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,545
much as you would animals.

371
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:12,606
Yes. We use their bodies,
alive and dead,

372
00:31:12,683 --> 00:31:15,677
experimentally for
anatomical dissection

373
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:18,418
and scientific research.

374
00:31:21,497 --> 00:31:25,799
Well, we do the same thing
to animals.

375
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,569
I mean, as a scientist,
I sympathize,

376
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:32,607
but I agree that that's a revelation
the masses would not take kindly to.

377
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:36,136
I think you did the right thing
in denying knowledge of colonel Taylor.

378
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:40,312
- There was another reason.
- Stevie: What?

379
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:43,084
They would have asked
ifhe was still alive.

380
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:46,687
- And is he?
- Oh, no, no, no, he can't be.

381
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:48,664
Well, how did you know?

382
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:51,225
Because

383
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:55,333
from the windows
of the spaceship...

384
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,403
we saw the Earth...

385
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,416
destroyed.

386
00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:09,130
Stand by.

387
00:32:12,202 --> 00:32:15,139
Good evening, this is Bill Bonds
reporting from Los Angeles

388
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:19,270
where the biggest story since
the moon landing broke this morning

389
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:23,944
I repeat, talked to the
Presidential Commission of lnquiry .

390
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:27,388
With me this evening in the studio
is Dr. Otto Hasslein.

391
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,950
He is a senior scientific advisor
at the White House.

392
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:32,225
And he'll be giving us his views
on the crucial statement

393
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:34,234
made at this
morning's session.

394
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:38,001
Dr. Hasslein, as I recall,
when you asked the male ape

395
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:39,737
where he was from,

396
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:43,304
the female replied,
"From your future."

397
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:45,978
- Yes.
- Would you believe that?

398
00:32:46,053 --> 00:32:49,616
Absolutely. I think
it is the only explanation.

399
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:52,253
Well, maybe the explanation
needs some explaining now.

400
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:54,491
You've written several
learned dissertations

401
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:56,626
on the nature of time.

402
00:32:56,702 --> 00:32:59,571
Could you explain in terms that
our viewers at home will understand?

403
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:02,805
How, for instance,
a person, or persons,

404
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:06,681
could travel from
time past to time future

405
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,415
or, indeed, vice versa?

406
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:12,220
Mr. Bonds, I think that time
can only be fully understood

407
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:16,163
by an observer with a godlike gift
ofinfinite regression.

408
00:33:16,232 --> 00:33:19,169
Could you explain
infinite regression for us?

409
00:33:19,237 --> 00:33:21,433
- Roll the film.
- I'd more than happy to.

410
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:23,442
As a matter offact,
I came prepared to do just that.

411
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,276
Now here's a painting
of a landscape.

412
00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:30,411
The artist who
painted that picture

413
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:32,252
says something is missing--
what is it?

414
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:36,456
"It is I myself, who was part
of the landscape I painted."

415
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:40,798
So he mentally takes
a step backward, or regresses,

416
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,103
and paints a picture of the artist
painting a picture of the landscape.

417
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:47,544
But still something is missing-- and
that something is still his real self

418
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:49,981
painting the second picture.

419
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,021
So he regresses further
and paints a third.

420
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:55,558
A picture of the artist
painting a picture

421
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:58,687
of the artist painting
a picture of the landscape.

422
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:01,199
But because something
is still missing,

423
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:03,203
he paints
a fourth and a fifth

424
00:34:03,271 --> 00:34:05,570
until he paints
a picture of the artist

425
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:09,704
painting a picture of the artist
painting a picture of the artist

426
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,945
painting a picture of the artist
painting a landscape.

427
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,215
So infinite regression then is--

428
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:19,227
It is the moment when our artist
has regressed to the point ofinfinity,

429
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:21,457
and himself, becomes part
of the landscape he painted

430
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:23,693
and is both the observer
and the observed.

431
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:26,466
Well, now in that
peculiar condition,

432
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:30,033
what would he be observing
ifhe were observing, let's say, time?

433
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:33,674
He would perceive, Mr. Bonds,
that time is like a freeway

434
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,719
with an infinite
number oflanes,

435
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:38,018
all leading from
the past into the future,

436
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,025
however, not unto the same future.

437
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:43,792
A driver in lane "A" may crash
while a driver in lane "B" survives.

438
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:47,735
It follows that a driver,
by changing lanes can change his future.

439
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:50,434
Now, Mr. Bonds, I do not
find it diffcult to believe

440
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:53,138
that in the dark and turbulent
corridors ofouter space,

441
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:57,049
the impact ofsome distant planetary ,
even galactic disaster,

442
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,315
jumped the apes from
their present into ours.

443
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,484
Indeed, the prooflies
in their arrival among us.

444
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:05,030
And in their spoken,
and I repeat spoken testimony.

445
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:07,294
Thank you very much,
Dr. Hasslein.

446
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:11,067
It's certainly the most incredible story
this reporter has ever covered.

447
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,575
I think that by their intelligence
and their good humor,

448
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,479
the 2 so-called "ape-o-nauts"
have already captured the hearts

449
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,949
of the entire American nation.

450
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,817
They will not be required

451
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:22,823
to appear before
the commission tomorrow.

452
00:35:22,891 --> 00:35:24,723
That hearing, of course,
is going to be held in private.

453
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:28,698
They will, however, be taken
from the zoo infirmary to a hotel,

454
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:31,829
and they will be given
an extended tour of the city.

455
00:35:31,905 --> 00:35:35,069
This is Bill Bonds reporting
for Eyewitness News.

456
00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:37,807
- Good night.
- Good night.

457
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:46,893
[Siren]

458
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:19,609
[Dog Barking]

459
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:28,753
- Your luggage, ma'am?
- Of course, it's mine!

460
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,942
Address, please.

461
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,913
- The zoo.
- [Laughs]

462
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,761
40.

463
00:37:42,937 --> 00:37:45,270
May I measure
your inside leg, sir?

464
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:50,103
- No.
- Oh.

465
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:59,683
Dr. Cornelius, tell me,
how do you find our women?

466
00:39:02,691 --> 00:39:04,626
Very human.

467
00:39:04,694 --> 00:39:06,427
Very good.
Very good.

468
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,265
Excuse me.

469
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:14,863
Madam Zira, I represent Furand Feather,
a pet magazine.

470
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,102
Do you think I'm a pet?

471
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:19,169
Well, yes, I do, rather.

472
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:25,588
- Say, why don't you try some?
- What is it?

473
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,684
Well, it's sort of
like grape juice plus.

474
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:35,097
Wait! Just a sip!

475
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:39,576
Madam Zira,
what is your favorite fruit?

476
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,670
Grape.

477
00:39:51,963 --> 00:39:54,365
And that's the way
it was tonight

478
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,266
at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.

479
00:39:56,337 --> 00:39:58,272
- Ha ha ha.
- Tomorrow, Zira is to speak

480
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,275
at the Bay Area's Women's Club.

481
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:04,179
And later, she'll accompany Dr. Hasslein
to the Museum of Natural History .

482
00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:07,880
Meanwhile, Cornelius will attend
a prizefight. That's his first one.

483
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:09,889
Later, he'll visit Disneyland

484
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:12,859
to dedicate a new boat
for theJungle Cruise.

485
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:14,863
Now, for a look
at the weather.

486
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:17,265
Sunny California will not
be exactly that tomorrow.

487
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:20,567
Clouds will cover the coastal area
with light showers predicted.

488
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,575
The downtown--

489
00:40:30,154 --> 00:40:32,123
[Knocking]

490
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:38,099
- Tired?
- A little.

491
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,904
- How is that?
- Soothing...

492
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:47,242
but very wet.

493
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:59,988
[Applause]

494
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,043
A marriage bed
is made for two,

495
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:11,811
but every damn morning
it's the woman who has to make it!

496
00:41:11,884 --> 00:41:15,253
We have heads
as well as hands.

497
00:41:15,323 --> 00:41:18,920
I call upon men
to let us use them!

498
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:25,270
[Crowd Cheering]

499
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,298
How do you like it,
Cornelius?

500
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,306
Beastly.

501
00:41:58,922 --> 00:42:01,518
A giant flesh-eating dinosaur.

502
00:42:01,593 --> 00:42:03,619
Now, its scientific name
is a compound

503
00:42:03,696 --> 00:42:06,165
of the greek antron
which means "hollow"

504
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,702
and dimas which
means "body frame."

505
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:11,366
Referring to
the backbone or vertebrae.

506
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:15,073
Now, this little fellow
is Camptosaurus Marsh,

507
00:42:15,147 --> 00:42:17,708
a primitive duckbilled dinosaur.

508
00:42:17,784 --> 00:42:22,416
Its scientific name is
a compound of the greek kampto,

509
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:24,927
which means
"flexible or bent,"

510
00:42:24,995 --> 00:42:27,521
and sauros,
which means "Iizard."

511
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,162
Its generic name,
therefore, is "flexible lizard."

512
00:42:31,238 --> 00:42:35,233
In 1 879, O.C. Marsh
of yale University

513
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:37,405
described the first known species

514
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:39,609
from the Jurassic beds
of arikoma.

515
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:42,712
Since then,
other specimens have been found--

516
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:49,956
- It must have been the shock.
- Shock, my foot!

517
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:52,025
I'm pregnant.

518
00:42:58,246 --> 00:43:00,909
I shan't leave you
until Cornelius is back.

519
00:43:00,983 --> 00:43:05,046
- No, no, no, no!
- No, I insist. Please sit down.

520
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:07,319
Now, is there anything
I can get you, Zira?

521
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:11,661
Well, I have a strange craving.

522
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:13,929
That is only natural.

523
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:16,598
For grape juice plus.

524
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:18,609
Grape juice plus?

525
00:43:18,677 --> 00:43:21,977
It's in the--
the refrigerator.

526
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:25,953
All right.

527
00:43:37,204 --> 00:43:39,139
Is this it?

528
00:43:45,985 --> 00:43:48,011
Here we go.

529
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:52,319
Lewis said only a sip.

530
00:43:52,394 --> 00:43:55,388
Zira, it is an excellent restorative,
I assure you.

531
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,061
Especially in cases ofpregnancy,
you know.

532
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:02,165
- How long have you known?
- Oh, since well before the war.

533
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:08,717
Mmm.

534
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:13,855
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Uh-uh.

535
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:18,059
Oh, no, I shouldn't,
not in your condition.

536
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:21,671
Who won your war?

537
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:24,608
It wasn't our war.

538
00:44:24,677 --> 00:44:27,146
It was the gorillas' war.

539
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:29,149
Chimpanzees are passion--

540
00:44:30,853 --> 00:44:33,186
pacifists!

541
00:44:33,256 --> 00:44:35,818
We stayed behind.
We never saw the enemy.

542
00:44:35,894 --> 00:44:37,691
But which side won?

543
00:44:37,764 --> 00:44:40,131
Neither.

544
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,669
But how do you know that
if you weren't there, Zira?

545
00:44:42,737 --> 00:44:45,036
When we were in space,

546
00:44:45,107 --> 00:44:50,742
we saw bright, white,
blinding light.

547
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:54,310
Then we saw the rim
of the Earth melt.

548
00:44:54,388 --> 00:44:59,419
Then there was
a tornado in the sky.

549
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,294
Wooo.

550
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,063
I feel magnificently sleepy.

551
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:06,071
The date meter
on the spaceship.

552
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:09,804
What did it read
af ter Earth's destruction?

553
00:45:09,878 --> 00:45:13,543
1 9...

554
00:45:13,617 --> 00:45:17,180
73.

555
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,284
And before-- before
the white light and the tornado?

556
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:23,195
39...

557
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:26,134
50...

558
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:28,332
something.

559
00:45:33,749 --> 00:45:36,275
Before the white light
and the tornado?

560
00:45:36,352 --> 00:45:38,480
Zira: 39...

561
00:45:38,555 --> 00:45:40,183
50...

562
00:45:40,258 --> 00:45:42,625
something.

563
00:45:42,695 --> 00:45:45,164
- So?
- So you have evidence, Mr. President,

564
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:47,259
that one day, talking apes
will dominate this Earth

565
00:45:47,336 --> 00:45:49,897
and eventually destroy it
by 3950 something.

566
00:45:49,973 --> 00:45:53,433
I doubt that we shall
still be in office by then.

567
00:45:53,512 --> 00:45:55,879
And according
to the NASA experts,

568
00:45:55,948 --> 00:45:59,681
who are still subjecting the spaceship
to microscopic scrutiny,

569
00:45:59,754 --> 00:46:01,620
the precise year
ofwhat you merely inferred

570
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,184
to be Earth's destruction
is recorded on the flight synthesizer

571
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:10,499
as 3955 A.D., presumably.

572
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:14,407
Now, what do you expect me
and the United Nations--

573
00:46:14,477 --> 00:46:16,639
though not necessarily
in that order--

574
00:46:16,713 --> 00:46:19,012
to do about it?

575
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:21,382
Alter what you believe to be
the course of the future

576
00:46:21,453 --> 00:46:23,422
by slaughtering 2 innocents?

577
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,256
Or rather 3, now that
one of them is pregnant.

578
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:29,560
Herod tried that,
and Christ survived.

579
00:46:29,632 --> 00:46:31,567
Mr. President,
Herod lacked our facilities.

580
00:46:31,636 --> 00:46:35,836
He also became very unpopular,
historically unpopular.

581
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:38,208
And we don't want
that to happen, do we?

582
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:43,447
I am saying that our 2 visitors seem
to be charming, peaceful people--

583
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:47,425
or rather creatures--
and that the voters love them.

584
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:49,894
Do you want them and their progeny
to dominate the world, Mr. President?

585
00:46:49,964 --> 00:46:53,163
Well, not at
the next election, no.

586
00:46:53,236 --> 00:46:55,398
But, one day,
if the progeny turn out

587
00:46:55,472 --> 00:46:57,964
as well as the parents,
who knows,

588
00:46:58,042 --> 00:47:00,008
they may do a betterjob ofit
than we have.

589
00:47:00,142 --> 00:47:02,475
By destroying the world?

590
00:47:02,546 --> 00:47:04,879
Are you quite sure that what
they saw destroyed was the world?

591
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,446
- Well, aren't you?
- I consider it dispassionately

592
00:47:09,523 --> 00:47:12,722
as a possibility,
not hysterically as a fact.

593
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:15,526
Mr. President, we have their own
testimony that they provoked the war.

594
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,695
And they seemed to have provoked
you pretty thoroughly into the bargain.

595
00:47:18,771 --> 00:47:21,673
I'm not saying that you're wrong,
Hasslein, but I am saying

596
00:47:21,741 --> 00:47:25,201
that before I have them shot
against the wall, I want convincing

597
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,150
that the handwriting on the wall
is calculably true.

598
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:31,746
Now... convince me.

599
00:47:34,861 --> 00:47:37,764
By their own testimony we know
that apes one day will acquire

600
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:40,029
the power of
intelligent speech.

601
00:47:40,103 --> 00:47:44,132
By Zira's testimony, we know
that she is pregnant with child.

602
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:46,678
By my own testimony we know
that it's genetically possible

603
00:47:46,746 --> 00:47:50,081
for this child-- provided, of course,
always that we permit its birth--

604
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:52,951
to bear or beget
a talking ape by a dumb one

605
00:47:53,023 --> 00:47:56,221
in a present-dayjungle
or a present-day zoo.

606
00:47:56,294 --> 00:47:59,993
Do you truly believe that
by deliberate present-day action

607
00:48:00,066 --> 00:48:02,001
we can neutralize
that possibility?

608
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:05,336
- That we can alter the future?
- Yes, Mr. President, I do.

609
00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:08,208
Do you also believe
that we should?

610
00:48:08,279 --> 00:48:10,976
Given the power to alter the future,
have we the right to use it?

611
00:48:12,586 --> 00:48:14,987
I don't know.

612
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:18,221
I've wrestled with this, Mr. President.
I just don't know.

613
00:48:18,294 --> 00:48:21,993
How many futures are there?
Which future has God, if there is a God,

614
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:24,093
chosen for man's destiny?

615
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:27,206
If I urged the destruction
of these 2 apes,

616
00:48:27,274 --> 00:48:29,767
am I defy ing God's will
or obeying it?

617
00:48:29,845 --> 00:48:31,905
Am I His enemy
or His instrument?

618
00:48:31,982 --> 00:48:35,579
An assassin would say the latter.

619
00:48:35,654 --> 00:48:38,123
- Do you approve of assassination?
- Well, Mr. President,

620
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:41,720
we condoned the attempted assassination
of Hitler because he was evil.

621
00:48:41,796 --> 00:48:43,731
Yes, but would we have
approved killing him

622
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,825
in babyhood when
he was still innocent?

623
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:47,838
Or killing his mother when
he was still in her womb?

624
00:48:47,906 --> 00:48:50,968
Or slaughtering
his remote ancestors?

625
00:48:51,044 --> 00:48:53,605
We have no proof, Hasslein,
that these apes are evil.

626
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,150
- Mr. President,
there are very strong indications.

627
00:48:56,218 --> 00:48:59,883
There were hesitancies
and small discrepancies in

628
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:01,926
Which suggests to me that
if they were properly interrogated--

629
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:04,759
Are you suggesting that they
were improperly interrogated?

630
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:07,357
- Let us say unprofessionally.
- You want it professional?

631
00:49:07,435 --> 00:49:09,563
- The full works, Mr. President.
- Tell that to the commission.

632
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:14,811
I'll abide by their findings.

633
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,943
Having convened in secret session
at the request of the president,

634
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:22,252
the commission makes
the following interim recommendations--

635
00:49:22,325 --> 00:49:24,556
" 1 . The public
should be informed

636
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,824
"that the apes, after
their arduous space voyage,

637
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:30,267
"and the fatigue arising
from its intended publicity,

638
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:33,638
"are to be afforded rest and privacy
in a location whose identity

639
00:49:33,709 --> 00:49:36,042
"will not be divulged
to the public.

640
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:38,947
"2. Since, however,

641
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,282
"there is justifiable cause
for suspecting

642
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:44,814
"that they have withheld vital
information from this commission,

643
00:49:44,892 --> 00:49:48,830
"the 'ape-o-nauts' will, in fact,
be escorted by Dr. Lewis Dixon

644
00:49:48,898 --> 00:49:51,595
"to the installation
known as Camp 1 1 .

645
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:54,697
"Held there in his care
for interrogation by the CIA

646
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:58,507
under the guidance and supervision
of Dr. Otto Hasslein."

647
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:16,674
Zira:
When we were in space,

648
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:19,882
we saw bright, white,
blinding light.

649
00:50:19,957 --> 00:50:21,892
Brighter than this?

650
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,054
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

651
00:50:27,969 --> 00:50:30,700
Zira: Then we saw
the rim of the Earth melt.

652
00:50:30,773 --> 00:50:34,267
Then there was
a tornado in the sky.

653
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:36,507
That's your voice, isn't it?

654
00:50:36,582 --> 00:50:39,212
How can I tell?
I don't even remember.

655
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:41,415
Why don't you remember?

656
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,723
Because Dr. Hasslein
made me drunk!

657
00:50:50,771 --> 00:50:53,502
Why did you tell something
to Dr. Hasslein when drunk

658
00:50:53,574 --> 00:50:55,509
that you never told
the commission when sober?

659
00:50:55,577 --> 00:50:57,978
Because you and your husband
were frightened

660
00:50:58,049 --> 00:51:00,780
for the safety of yourselves
and your unborn child?

661
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:03,686
I withheld nothing.
Nobody asked me.

662
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:07,159
But ifsomebody had asked...

663
00:51:07,228 --> 00:51:09,721
I should have said
that chimpanzees

664
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,269
had no part in
the destruction of Earth.

665
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:14,636
Only the gorillas
and the orangutans.

666
00:51:14,707 --> 00:51:16,767
What's the difference?
You're all monkeys.

667
00:51:16,843 --> 00:51:19,405
Please do not use
the word monkey.

668
00:51:19,481 --> 00:51:22,076
It is offensive to us.
As an archaeologist,

669
00:51:22,151 --> 00:51:25,714
I had access to history scrolls
which were kept secret from the masses

670
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,726
and I suspect that the weapon
which destroyed Earth

671
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,786
was man's own invention.

672
00:51:30,865 --> 00:51:35,201
I do know this: one of the reasons
for man's original downfall

673
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:38,070
was your peculiar habit
ofmurdering one another.

674
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:41,545
Man destroys man.
Apes do not destroy apes.

675
00:51:41,614 --> 00:51:43,549
Cornelius.

676
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:46,912
This is not
an interracial hassle,

677
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:48,924
but a search for facts.

678
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:52,395
We do not deny the possibility
ofman's decline and fall.

679
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:54,626
All we want to find out
is how apes rose.

680
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,275
Well...

681
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:04,645
it began in our prehistory

682
00:52:04,716 --> 00:52:07,277
with the plague
that fell upon dogs.

683
00:52:07,353 --> 00:52:11,291
- And cats.
- Hundreds and thousands of them died,

684
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,194
and hundreds and thousands of them
had to be destroyed

685
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:17,497
in order to prevent
the spread ofinfection.

686
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:21,063
- There were dog bonfires.
- Yes. And by the time

687
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:25,307
the plague was contained,
man was without pets.

688
00:52:25,381 --> 00:52:28,408
Of course, for man,
this was intolerable.

689
00:52:28,485 --> 00:52:30,477
I mean, he might
kill his brother,

690
00:52:30,555 --> 00:52:32,684
but he could not kill his dog.

691
00:52:32,759 --> 00:52:37,221
So humans took
primitive apes as pets.

692
00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:39,029
Zira:
Primitive and dumb,

693
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:42,767
but still 20 times more intelligent
than dogs or cats.

694
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:45,072
Correct.

695
00:52:45,144 --> 00:52:47,079
They were quartered in cages,
but they lived

696
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:49,446
and moved freely
in human homes.

697
00:52:49,517 --> 00:52:52,079
They became responsive
to human speech,

698
00:52:52,155 --> 00:52:56,093
and in the course ofless
than 2 centuries,

699
00:52:56,161 --> 00:52:59,621
they progressed from
performing mere tricks

700
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,135
to performing services.

701
00:53:02,203 --> 00:53:08,042
Nothing more or less than
a well-trained sheepdog could do.

702
00:53:08,112 --> 00:53:11,675
Could a sheepdog cook
or clean the house

703
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:14,482
or do the marketing for the groceries
with a list from its mistress

704
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,490
or wait on tables?

705
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:20,519
Or after 3 more centuries,
turn the tables on their owners?

706
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,566
How?

707
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:27,870
They became alert to
the concept ofslavery ,

708
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:31,311
and, as their numbers grew,
to slavery 's antidote,

709
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:33,612
which, of course, is unity.

710
00:53:33,684 --> 00:53:36,917
Well, at first,
they began assembling in small groups.

711
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:41,325
They learned the art of corporate
and militant action.

712
00:53:41,396 --> 00:53:44,367
They learned to refuse.

713
00:53:44,434 --> 00:53:48,873
At first, theyjust
grunted their refusal.

714
00:53:48,941 --> 00:53:51,376
But then,
on an historic day

715
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:53,379
which is commemorated
by my species

716
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:56,350
and fully documented
in the sacred scrolls,

717
00:53:56,419 --> 00:53:58,354
there came Aldo.

718
00:53:58,422 --> 00:54:00,948
He did not grunt.

719
00:54:01,025 --> 00:54:03,359
He articulated.

720
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,026
He spoke a word which
had been spoken to him

721
00:54:07,101 --> 00:54:10,698
over time without number
by humans.

722
00:54:10,773 --> 00:54:13,744
He said...

723
00:54:13,812 --> 00:54:15,940
"No."

724
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:26,089
So that's how
it all started.

725
00:54:27,866 --> 00:54:29,858
Clip one, please.

726
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:35,169
Cornelius:
Where we come from, apes talk.

727
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:37,179
Humans are dumb.

728
00:54:37,247 --> 00:54:40,047
You recognize your husband's words
to the commission?

729
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:42,054
Yes.

730
00:54:42,122 --> 00:54:45,183
So humans were dumb.
Were they happy?

731
00:54:45,259 --> 00:54:47,194
Clip two.

732
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:50,165
Zira:
As to humans, I've dissect--

733
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:52,965
I've examined thousands of them.

734
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:55,132
And until now,
I've only discovered

735
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:57,142
2 who could talk in my life.

736
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,739
Why did you change words
in the middle of a sentence?

737
00:55:00,816 --> 00:55:02,785
Repeat first three seconds
of clip two.

738
00:55:04,722 --> 00:55:09,253
Zira: As to humans,
I've dissect-- I've examined--

739
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:12,629
- What was the word you didn't finish?
- I can't remember.

740
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,569
- Play the loop.
- Zira: Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--

741
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:17,870
- Complete the word, monkey.
- Look, I have told you--

742
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:20,241
- Complete the word!
- Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--

743
00:55:20,312 --> 00:55:22,144
Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--

744
00:55:22,215 --> 00:55:24,651
Sounds as if I had hiccups!

745
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,982
[Laughing]

746
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,294
Call for Dr. Dixon, please.

747
00:55:32,531 --> 00:55:36,629
Dr. Dixon?
Dr. Hasslein calling Dr. Dixon.

748
00:55:39,876 --> 00:55:41,811
P.A.:
Calling Dr. Dixon.

749
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:51,320
Ah, Dr. Dixon. Come in.

750
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:03,271
- Be good enough to administer
this to the female.

751
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:05,507
Sodium Pentothal.
1/2 gram l.V.

752
00:56:05,581 --> 00:56:09,212
- Dr. Hasslein,
I'm an animal psychiatrist.

753
00:56:09,287 --> 00:56:11,882
You have
the commission's authority.

754
00:56:11,957 --> 00:56:15,156
And that of the president.
Please.

755
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:23,134
Zira, I've been asked
to give you an injection--

756
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:26,543
You can't use that! We only
use those things for killing.

757
00:56:26,613 --> 00:56:29,777
-Killing?
-No, this is not for killing, Cornelius.

758
00:56:29,851 --> 00:56:31,946
This is for relaxing.
It won't harm her.

759
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,924
- Will it harm my baby?
- No, it won't.

760
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:37,484
So, Zira, if you would
just come with me, please.

761
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:40,055
Lewis, you can't
use that on Zira!

762
00:56:40,134 --> 00:56:43,594
- Please, take him to his quarters!
- Really.

763
00:56:43,673 --> 00:56:45,972
No, you mustn't!

764
00:56:47,344 --> 00:56:49,371
Zira! Zira!

765
00:56:58,194 --> 00:57:00,060
Please.

766
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:03,702
Just lie down on the couch.

767
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:10,605
And bare your arm, please.

768
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,081
You don't have to tell me!

769
00:57:21,029 --> 00:57:25,559
This has the same effect
as grape juice plus.

770
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,187
Now count backward from 1 0.

771
00:57:41,259 --> 00:57:43,661
1 0...9...

772
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,699
8...7...

773
00:57:45,767 --> 00:57:48,703
6...5.

774
00:57:50,774 --> 00:57:52,470
4.

775
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,341
What comes after 4?

776
00:57:56,415 --> 00:57:58,043
2.

777
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:04,223
- Thank you, Dr. Dixon.
- It's customary to stay.

778
00:58:13,308 --> 00:58:16,746
- Zira.
- Hmm.

779
00:58:16,814 --> 00:58:19,807
You worked
in a room like this.

780
00:58:19,884 --> 00:58:21,750
Hmm...

781
00:58:22,823 --> 00:58:26,886
Bigger. Not so pretty.

782
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:30,764
And there you practiced--

783
00:58:30,835 --> 00:58:33,738
Comparative.

784
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:36,367
Comparative what?

785
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:39,277
- An--an--an--
- Anatomy?

786
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:43,286
- Anata--
- Whose anatomies did you compare?

787
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:45,289
Apes and humans?

788
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:51,695
Zira, say yes
if you mean yes.

789
00:58:52,831 --> 00:58:56,461
- Yes.
- So you dissected other apes?

790
00:58:56,536 --> 00:58:58,402
Ye--yes...

791
00:58:58,472 --> 00:59:02,410
when they died
a natural death.

792
00:59:02,479 --> 00:59:05,415
And humans, too, of course.

793
00:59:05,483 --> 00:59:07,315
Yes...

794
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:10,755
as they were made available.

795
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:15,993
- Available?
- Gorillas hunted them for sport

796
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:18,797
in nets and with guns.

797
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,035
The survivors were put in cages.

798
00:59:22,108 --> 00:59:26,012
The army used some
for target practice.

799
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:29,176
We could pick from the rest.

800
00:59:29,252 --> 00:59:33,315
In the interest ofscience,
you dissected, removed,

801
00:59:33,392 --> 00:59:35,189
and statistically compared...

802
00:59:35,261 --> 00:59:39,462

veins, arteries,

803

804
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:44,240

nails, tongues, eyes,

806
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:49,544
noses, nervous systems,

807
00:59:49,617 --> 00:59:51,916
the various reflexes.

808
00:59:51,987 --> 00:59:53,853
Reflexes?

809
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,858
Of the dead?

810
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:59,989
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Of the living.

811
01:00:00,065 --> 01:00:03,366
You can't make
a dead man's knee jump

812
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:08,468
any more than you can test
a corpse's reaction to a lobotomy.

813
01:00:08,546 --> 01:00:10,481
You were advanced enough

814
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:14,487
to perform experimental
brain surgery on living humans?

815
01:00:14,555 --> 01:00:18,687
Oh, yes.
We even tried to stimulate

816
01:00:18,761 --> 01:00:21,698
their atrophied speech centers.

817
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:23,826
Did you try to stimulate

818
01:00:23,902 --> 01:00:25,837
Colonel Taylor's speech centers?

819
01:00:25,905 --> 01:00:29,707
Of course not.
He could talk already.

820
01:00:29,778 --> 01:00:33,010
When you left,
was Colonel Taylor alive?

821
01:00:33,082 --> 01:00:36,144
We loved Taylor.

822
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:40,215
We did all we could
to help him--

Cornelius!

825
01:00:47,137 --> 01:00:49,072
She needs a nap.

826

She'll get it.

827
01:00:55,316 --> 01:00:58,252
Orderly.

828
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,760
- Sir?
- Take the female ape to its quarters.

829
01:01:02,828 --> 01:01:06,596
We must get this
to the commission.

If you'll be seated,
we'll get down to business.

01:01:24,427 --> 01:01:27,865
Now, let me review
our conclusions.

- Were they armed?
- No, I don't believe so.

944
01:09:34,143 --> 01:09:38,081
Then there's no need
for a shooting match.

945
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:40,084
Not strictly speaking.

946
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:42,087
I am speaking strictly,
Hasslein.

947
01:09:42,155 --> 01:09:44,386
Science regards
these apes as unique.

948
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:46,984
People regard them
as practically human.

949
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:49,498
The killers of today
could become

950
01:09:49,566 --> 01:09:51,660
the mass murderers of tomorrow.

951
01:09:51,736 --> 01:09:55,174
I can think ofno one
better equipped emotionally

952
01:09:55,242 --> 01:09:58,178
to persuade the people
of that possibility,

953
01:09:58,246 --> 01:10:01,183
but, in a democracy,
we do not shoot

954
01:10:01,251 --> 01:10:04,187
unarmed suspects on sight
for a murder

955
01:10:04,255 --> 01:10:07,192
in which their participation
is still legally unproven.

956
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,754
I want them taken, yes,
but taken alive.

957
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:12,698
Is that clear?

958
01:10:12,768 --> 01:10:14,862
Quite clear, Mr. President.

959
01:10:45,751 --> 01:10:47,686
You lost, miss?

960
01:10:47,754 --> 01:10:49,689
Oh, it's you, Dr. Branton.

961
01:10:49,757 --> 01:10:52,124
Be careful.
There's been a murder.

962
01:10:52,194 --> 01:10:56,326
- Murder?
- The monkeys have killed

963
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,838
What? I don't believe it.
How did it happen?

964
01:10:59,906 --> 01:11:02,843
All I know is they've
killed their orderly,

965
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:07,179
And I've been given orders
to find them. Drive carefully.

966
01:11:07,251 --> 01:11:10,654
There will be a lot
ofvehicles in the area.

967
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:36,894
Cornelius, what have you done?

968
01:11:36,962 --> 01:11:39,398
I didn't mean to kill him.

969
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:41,901
He was teasing Zira.
I hit him with a tray.

970
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:45,601
- Please believe me.
- I do, Cornelius, but they won't.

971
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:50,342
- Where's Zira?
- She's back there.

972
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:52,682
Stevie... she's in labor.

973
01:11:52,753 --> 01:11:56,451
Oh, God. Get in.

974
01:12:02,435 --> 01:12:06,874
Stevie, you won't
take us back to the camp?

975
01:12:06,941 --> 01:12:10,379
Get down.
I have a better idea.

976
01:12:26,137 --> 01:12:29,472
Now, wait a second.
Just a moment.

977
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:31,477
Let me get this straight.

978
01:12:31,545 --> 01:12:34,481
You are asking me
to risk imprisonment

979
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:37,418
for the sake of two
fugitive apes?

980
01:12:37,488 --> 01:12:40,926
The answer is
a thousand times... yes.

981
01:12:40,993 --> 01:12:43,929
Oh, yes.
I do it for you

982
01:12:43,997 --> 01:12:45,932
and for Stevie

983
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,435
and for your two
distinguished friends.

984
01:12:48,504 --> 01:12:51,942
- Uh, notorious now.
- The hell with notoriety.

985
01:12:52,009 --> 01:12:54,946
What is a husband
expected to do?

986
01:12:55,014 --> 01:12:57,950
Stand by and see
his wife insulted?

987
01:12:58,018 --> 01:13:00,955
Aren't we rude
enough to each other

988
01:13:01,023 --> 01:13:03,959
without having to be
rude to animals?

989
01:13:04,027 --> 01:13:06,964
Anyway, he didn't mean
to kill the boy.

990
01:13:07,032 --> 01:13:09,058
Los trato bien, muchachos?

991
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,901
Si, patron. Salud!

992
01:13:11,973 --> 01:13:14,408
I sure appreciate
what you're doing.

993
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,912
You helped deliver
our last baby.

994
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,415
Now you will deliver our next.

995
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:28,998
Lewis!
What took you so long?

996
01:13:29,065 --> 01:13:31,865
I had to make some excuse.
They think I'm searching.

997
01:13:31,937 --> 01:13:36,342
- Armando's been a saint.
- Saint Francis would have

998
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:40,542
- Never.
- Say hello to Heloise

999
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:43,314
and your goddaughter Salome.

1000
01:13:43,387 --> 01:13:47,758
- Hello, Salome.
- The first chimp ever born in a circus.

1001
01:13:47,827 --> 01:13:49,659
Los Angeles has had four.

1002
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:52,929
Los Angeles isn't a circus.
It's a zoo.

1003
01:13:53,002 --> 01:13:54,937
So New Yorkers say.

1004
01:13:55,005 --> 01:13:57,099
Lewis is here.

1005
01:13:57,175 --> 01:14:00,112
Lewis, I was not responsible
for the death--

1006
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:05,620
I know, but you will be responsible
for a birth. How is she?

1007
01:14:05,687 --> 01:14:08,021
The pains are coming
every five minutes.

1008
01:14:08,092 --> 01:14:10,584
Every four.

1009
01:14:10,662 --> 01:14:12,858
[Chattering]

1010
01:14:12,932 --> 01:14:17,394
- Look. Look at Heloise.
- [Baby Chattering]

1011
01:14:17,473 --> 01:14:20,307
She's showing an expectant mother
what to expect.

1012
01:14:20,377 --> 01:14:22,869
Mama. Mama.

1013
01:14:22,947 --> 01:14:25,884
Say it. Mama.

1014
01:14:25,952 --> 01:14:27,978
- Mama.
- Zira.

1015
01:14:28,055 --> 01:14:29,990
Zira, don't waste your breath.

1016
01:14:30,058 --> 01:14:32,995
You know the child
of two primitive apes

1017
01:14:33,063 --> 01:14:35,999
will never learn how to speak.

1018
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:38,002
I'm getting into practice.

1019
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:41,007
Mama. Mama.

1020
01:14:41,075 --> 01:14:44,243
Mam--
[Moaning]

1021
01:14:51,455 --> 01:14:53,390
There. That's good.

1022
01:14:55,961 --> 01:14:57,896
Come on. Over here.

1023
01:15:05,977 --> 01:15:08,412
What are we going to call...

1024
01:15:08,481 --> 01:15:10,916
- Him.
- him?

1025
01:15:10,984 --> 01:15:12,919
Milo?

1026
01:15:15,992 --> 01:15:17,927
Milo.

1027
01:15:18,996 --> 01:15:20,931
Milo.

1028
01:15:25,507 --> 01:15:28,443
- Milo.
- Congratulations.

1029
01:15:28,511 --> 01:15:30,446
Oh.

1030
01:15:32,517 --> 01:15:34,452
[Coughing]

1031
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,854
- No?
- No.

1032
01:15:57,088 --> 01:16:00,526
- But, sir--
- Captain, I'm aware

1033
01:16:00,593 --> 01:16:02,528
the areas we first established.

1034
01:16:02,596 --> 01:16:06,034
Evidently, we were wrong
because you haven't found them!

1035
01:16:06,102 --> 01:16:09,197
Thank you.
Dr. Dixon, can you pinpoint

1036
01:16:09,272 --> 01:16:12,607
the probable date of the baby's birth
with any degree of accuracy?

1037
01:16:12,678 --> 01:16:16,343
Well, I never examined her,
but from appearances

1038
01:16:16,417 --> 01:16:18,613
I'd say a week to 1 0 days.

1039
01:16:18,687 --> 01:16:21,453
If that's close,
she can't have gone far.

1040
01:16:21,525 --> 01:16:23,551
- Where do apes go?
- To other apes.

1041
01:16:26,632 --> 01:16:32,039
Of course. Captain, I want you
to start an immediate search

1042
01:16:32,107 --> 01:16:34,805
ofevery menagerie,
zoo, and circus.

1043
01:16:34,879 --> 01:16:36,973
I'll augment your force
with the city police,

1044
01:16:37,048 --> 01:16:41,350
and I want to be kept informed
about all results.

1045
01:16:41,421 --> 01:16:44,722
- Yes, sir.
- [Door Closes]

1046
01:16:48,266 --> 01:16:50,929
- Lewis will think ofsomething.
- I am so sorry .

1047
01:16:51,003 --> 01:16:52,869
I had planned it so well.

1048
01:16:52,939 --> 01:16:56,934
In one month, we move on
to our winter quarters in Florida.

1049
01:16:57,012 --> 01:17:00,006
I could have released you
in the Everglades.

1050
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:03,987
You might have lived
happily ever af ter.

1051
01:17:04,056 --> 01:17:06,491
But now...
what can I do?

1052
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,998
You have done enough
to make us grateful forever.

1053
01:17:10,065 --> 01:17:14,504
I did it because
I like chimpanzees best of all apes,

1054
01:17:14,572 --> 01:17:17,907
and you,
the best of all chimpanzees.

1055
01:17:19,479 --> 01:17:23,440
I did it because I hate those
who try to alter destiny

1056
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:26,580
which is the unalterable
will ofGod.

1057
01:17:26,657 --> 01:17:28,592
Ifit is man's destiny

1058
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,595
one day to be dominated,

1059
01:17:30,663 --> 01:17:33,030
Iet him be dominated by you.

1060
01:17:34,936 --> 01:17:38,168
All I can now do
to help you

1061
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:42,180
is give you this
for the baby.

1062
01:17:42,248 --> 01:17:46,016
It's a medal of
Saint Francis of assisi.

1063
01:17:46,087 --> 01:17:49,353
- Who is he?
- He was a holy man

1064
01:17:49,424 --> 01:17:51,860
who loved and cared for animals.

1065
01:17:51,929 --> 01:17:54,364
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.

1066
01:17:54,432 --> 01:17:57,197
We'll hang it around
the baby's neck

1067
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:59,205
for protection, huh?

1068
01:17:59,273 --> 01:18:02,244
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1069
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,746
And now, my dear,
dear friends,

1070
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:08,752
before the police come
and the audience gathers,

1071
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:11,222
you and your pretty baby must go.

1072
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,227
Lewis is on his way.

1073
01:18:13,295 --> 01:18:16,060
- Armando.
- Yes?

1074
01:18:16,132 --> 01:18:19,900
I should like to say good-bye
to Heloise first.

1075
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:23,272
Ifshe could speak,
she'd say she's sorry .

1076
01:18:23,343 --> 01:18:27,111
I know, but we
understand each other.

1077
01:18:30,253 --> 01:18:32,188
All right.
All right.

1078
01:19:32,415 --> 01:19:35,783
This is as far
as we dare to take you.

1079
01:19:35,852 --> 01:19:39,346
The police have roadblocks
on every main exit.

1080
01:19:39,425 --> 01:19:41,690
- Here are your supplies.
- Thank you.

1081
01:19:41,762 --> 01:19:43,731
Can you read a map?

1082
01:19:43,799 --> 01:19:47,236
I'm an archaeologist.
I can even draw one.

1083
01:19:49,306 --> 01:19:51,241
We're at the city limits

1084
01:19:51,309 --> 01:19:54,246
at the southern edge
of this oil field.

1085
01:19:54,314 --> 01:19:56,749
Over this hill,
you'll pass through

1086
01:19:56,818 --> 01:19:59,254
more oil wells,
an abandoned refinery ,

1087
01:19:59,322 --> 01:20:02,258
and you'll be looking
down at a harbor.

1088
01:20:02,326 --> 01:20:04,761
It's a graveyard
for old ships.

1089
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:07,266
I played there as a kid.

1090
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:10,270
There's a derelict tanker
at one end.

1091
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,569
- You can hide there for a week.
- A week?

1092
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:16,944
Until the commotion dies down and
we can smuggle you back to the circus.

1093
01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:20,350
Then you can travel
with them to Florida,

1094
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:24,017
found a colony in the Everglades,
and live happily ever after.
