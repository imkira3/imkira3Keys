2
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:25,746
Will!

3
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:29,541
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

4
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,003
You look beautiful.

5
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:38,508
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

6
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,886
- Make way! Let me through!
- How dare you!

7
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,348
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

8
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,185
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

9
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:53,397
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

10
00:02:55,233 --> 00:03:00,363
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

11
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:03,406
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

12
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:09,412
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

13
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:19,047
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- ls it? That's annoying. My mistake.

14
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,549
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?

15
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:25,260
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

16
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:29,473
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.

17
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,767
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?

18
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,437
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

19
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,065
That wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.

20
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:41,777
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

21
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:45,321
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

22
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:47,782
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

23
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,577
The charge is "conspiring to set free"

24
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,331
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

25
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:59,252
"and condemned to death,
for which the..."

26
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:02,964
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

27
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:08,635
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

28
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,679
Captain.

29
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:17,519
Captain Jack Sparrow.

30
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:19,813
Yes, I thought you might.

31
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:26,778
♪ Fifteen men
on a dead man's chest

32
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:31,699
♪ Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

33
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:37,121
♪ Drink and the devil
had done for the rest

34
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:41,876
♪ Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

35
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:06,608
Prisoners, come on!

36
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:17,367
Aaah!

37
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:46,744
Sorry, mate.

38
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:52,041
Mind if we make a little side trip?

39
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:55,253
I didn't think so.

40
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:05,304
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,

41
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:07,472
were overcome.

42
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,311
- You got what you went in for, then?
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:17,816
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

44
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:21,320
were expecting something
a bit more... shiny,

45
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:25,573
the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

46
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:28,284
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.

47
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:30,995
- And the hurricane.
- Aye.

48
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,499
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

49
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:41,005
- Shiny.
- Aye, shiny.

50
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,133
Is that how you're all feeling?

51
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:49,554
That perhaps dear old Jack is not
serving your best interests as captain?

52
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:51,932
Walk the plank.

53
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:55,018
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.

54
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:58,480
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

55
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:10,199
- You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.

56
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,496
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.

57
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:19,500
It is a drawing of a key.

58
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,800
Gentlemen,

59
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,802
what do keys do?

60
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:32,679
Keys...

61
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,139
...unlock things?

62
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:39,060
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

63
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,397
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

64
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,065
No.

65
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,569
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

66
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:52,532
So, what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

67
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:57,077
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

68
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,496
So we're going after this key.

69
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,916
You're not making any sense at all.

70
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,377
Any more questions?

71
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,046
So... do we have a heading?

72
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,257
Ah! A heading.

73
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,803
Set sail in a... uh...

74
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,722
...general...

75
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,311
That-way direction.

76
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:25,563
Captain?

77
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:28,941
Come on, snap to and make sail.
You know how this works. Go on.

78
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:36,240
Have you noticed lately

79
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:40,952
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

80
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:43,830
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

81
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:46,958
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

82
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:50,837
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

83
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:07,644
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

84
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:10,064
Those won't be necessary.

85
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:18,655
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

86
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,660
We wish for you to act as our agent

87
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:28,873
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

88
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:31,334
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?

89
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,378
We've had dealings in the past.

90
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:39,008
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

91
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:41,427
What mark did he leave on you?

92
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:47,891
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

93
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:50,018
I would like you to go to him

94
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:54,648
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

95
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,442
Recover. At the point of a sword?

96
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:00,070
Bargain.

97
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:08,494
Letters of marque.

98
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:12,331
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.

99
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:16,627
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

100
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:22,216
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

101
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,385
Freedom.

102
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:28,680
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

103
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,640
The world is shrinking,

104
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:34,144
the blank edges of the map filled in.

105
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:38,106
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

106
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,942
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

107
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:43,903
You and your fiancée
face the hangman's noose.

108
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:49,409
- So you get Jack and the Black Pearl.
- The Black Pearl?

109
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:53,203
- The property you want he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.

110
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:57,833
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

111
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,503
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

112
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,214
A compass?

113
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,425
Ah, you know it.

114
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:12,138
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

115
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,956
Why is the rum always gone?

116
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:47,255
Oh.

117
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:51,009
That's why.

118
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:59,016
As you were, gents.

119
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,215
Ah.

120
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:36,135
Time's run out, Jack.

121
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:57,239
Bootstrap.

122
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:59,533
Bill Turner.

123
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:06,622
You look good, Jack.

124
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,589
Is this a dream?

125
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:17,091
No.

126
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:20,761
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

127
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:31,146
You got the Pearl back, I see.

128
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:35,692
I had some help retrieving
the Pearl, by the way.

129
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:39,321
Your son.

130
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:41,865
William?

131
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,035
He ended up a pirate after all.

132
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,830
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

133
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:52,082
He sent me.

134
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:56,086
Davy Jones.

135
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,756
Oh.

136
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,841
So it's you, then.

137
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:05,763
He shanghaied you into service, eh?

138
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,848
I chose it.

139
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:12,935
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

140
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:16,272
I stood up for you.

141
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,775
Everything went wrong after that.

142
00:15:20,944 --> 00:15:25,782
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

143
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,785
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

144
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:30,452
Unable to move.

145
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:34,748
Unable to die, Jack.

146
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:40,420
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

147
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,298
I would trade anything for it.

148
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:48,637
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

149
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,390
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

150
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:53,933
He raised the Pearl
from the depths for you.

151
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:56,268
Thirteen years,
you've been her captain.

152
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:58,187
- Technically...
- Jack.

153
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:00,689
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

154
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:03,526
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

155
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,947
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

156
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:10,449
The Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...

157
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:12,868
Then it's the locker for you!

158
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:16,162
Jones's terrible leviathan
will find you

159
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:20,625
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.

160
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:25,171
Any idea when Jones
might release said terrible beastie?

161
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,008
I already told you, Jack.

162
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,263
Your time is up.

163
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:36,181
It comes now,

164
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:41,645
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

165
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:54,032
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

166
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:56,368
On deck! Scurry!

167
00:16:56,453 --> 00:17:01,038
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

168
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:04,917
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

169
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:09,380
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

170
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:12,884
- Do we have a heading?
- Aah! Ooh. Run! Land.

171
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:21,725
- Which port?
- Didn't say. I said "land." Any land.

172
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:31,276
- Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- No, no!

173
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,653
Leave it!

174
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,740
Run.

175
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:40,744
Back to your stations, the lot of you!

176
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:50,920
- Jack?
- Shh.

177
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:56,467
For the love of mother and child,
Jack, what's coming after us?

178
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,260
Nothing.

179
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:15,917
- Here, now, you can't be here.
- I think you'll find he can.

180
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:17,502
Mr. Swann!

181
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:19,671
Governor Swann, still.

182
00:19:19,714 --> 00:19:23,008
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

183
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,261
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

184
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:30,807
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and
convince him to return to Port Royal.

185
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,559
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

186
00:19:33,643 --> 00:19:37,354
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

187
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,982
Is that a lack of faith
in Jack or in me?

188
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,443
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow's

189
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:46,363
does not mean he would do
the same for anyone else.

190
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:50,701
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

191
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:53,871
I have faith in you.

192
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:55,580
Both of you.

193
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,835
Where will you find him?

194
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:05,590
Tortuga. I'll start there and I
won't stop searching till I find him.

195
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:09,552
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

196
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:12,930
- Properly?
- Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

197
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:16,808
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

198
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:29,071
- I'll wait for you.
- Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

199
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:40,665
Captain Jack Sparrow?

200
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:46,087
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

201
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:50,091
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

202
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:54,470
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

203
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,597
Jack Sparrow?

204
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,724
I haven't seen him in a month.

205
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:02,602
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

206
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:06,231
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

207
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:08,942
but there's an island
just south of the straits

208
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,403
where I trade spice for...

209
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:14,114
...mmm, delicious long pork.

210
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,786
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.

211
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,205
A ship with black sails.

212
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:31,630
My brother will take you ashore.

213
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,393
What's wrong? The beach is there.

214
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:47,145
What?

215
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,399
Bon voyage, monsieur.

216
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,926
Jack!

217
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:22,012
Jack Sparrow!

218
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:29,935
Marty!

219
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:32,521
Cotton!

220
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:35,483
Anybody?

221
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,865
Ah. A familiar face.

222
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:45,284
Don't eat me.

223
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:48,370
- I'm not going to eat you.
- Don't eat me.

224
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:51,039
No. Don't eat me.

225
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:03,968
Gibbs.

226
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:36,249
Come on! Let's go!

227
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,212
Come on! Who wants it?

228
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,342
I can do this all day!

229
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:52,280
Jack?

230
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,699
Jack Sparrow!

231
00:24:54,783 --> 00:24:57,452
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.

232
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,170
Jack, it's me.

233
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:09,546
Will Turner.

234
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,387
Tell them to let me down!

235
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:22,643
...Eensy-weensy.

236
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,524
...Eunuchy. Snip, snip.

237
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:34,862
Eunuchy.

238
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:40,201
- Jack, the compass.
- That's all I need.

239
00:25:40,243 --> 00:25:43,329
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for helping you.

240
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:45,748
She faces the gallows!

241
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:55,173
Savvy?

242
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:02,722
Save me.

243
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:06,059
Jack, what did you tell them?

244
00:26:06,143 --> 00:26:08,186
No!

245
00:26:08,604 --> 00:26:10,896
What about Elizabeth?

246
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:12,564
Jack!

247
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:17,653
That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.

248
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:22,074
- We don't bite.
- Go on. We won't bite you.

249
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,246
Come quickly.

250
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:30,582
- Tell me what's happening.
- Our name still has some standing.

251
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:34,210
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.

252
00:26:34,253 --> 00:26:36,254
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

253
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:38,423
We cannot count on William Turner.

254
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:41,551
- Come!
- He's better than you give him credit.

255
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:45,179
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only,

256
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:47,598
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

257
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:49,392
Even if Will succeeds,

258
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:51,978
do not ask me to endure
the sight of my daughter

259
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:54,563
walking to the gallows. Do not.

260
00:26:55,606 --> 00:27:00,027
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

261
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:02,404
A fair trial for Will
ends in a hanging.

262
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,157
Then there is nothing left
for you here.

263
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:11,288
Whoa!

264
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:14,499
Wait inside.

265
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,626
Captain?

266
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,131
Captain.

267
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:30,264
Evening, governor.

268
00:27:30,307 --> 00:27:32,308
Shame, that.

269
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:34,560
He was carrying this.

270
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:37,353
It's a letter to the king.

271
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:39,814
- It's from you.
- No...

272
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:45,320
Elizabeth.

273
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:48,448
What are you doing?

274
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,661
- Where is she?
- Who?

275
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:15,641
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

276
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:18,018
as your father believes.

277
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:21,354
Then what is?

278
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:24,690
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

279
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:30,071
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.

280
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:33,366
- I'm here to negotiate.
- I'm listening.

281
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:38,204
I'm listening intently.

282
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:42,542
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.

283
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:47,379
Yes, and they're not valid until they
bear my signature and my seal.

284
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:50,132
Or else I would not still be here.

285
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:54,261
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

286
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:58,098
- It will do you no good.
- Do explain.

287
00:28:58,182 --> 00:29:02,894
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

288
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:05,104
There is something
you need to know.

289
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:07,273
Ah, I see.

290
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:10,484
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

291
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:13,737
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

292
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:16,907
But you mustn't worry.

293
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,828
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

294
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:23,414
My desires are not so provincial.

295
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:28,418
There's more than one chest
of value in these waters.

296
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,715
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

297
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:41,055
Consider into your calculations that
you robbed me of my wedding night.

298
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:43,308
So I did.

299
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:47,562
A marriage interrupted...

300
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:52,608
...or fate intervenes?

301
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:56,612
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

302
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:59,239
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Oh, really?

303
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:02,034
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then,

304
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:05,662
I'll still want that compass.

305
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:09,374
Consider that in your calculations.

306
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:32,104
I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.

307
00:30:32,147 --> 00:30:34,814
And I say it was me being clever.

308
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:38,735
Ain't that right, poochie?

309
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:41,154
How'd you know it weren't
Divine Providence

310
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,989
what inspired you to be clever?

311
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,200
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

312
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:50,622
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?

313
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:55,334
Since we're not immortal no more. We
gotta take care of our immortal souls.

314
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:56,669
You know you can't read.

315
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:59,171
It's the Bible.
You get credit for trying.

316
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:04,760
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...

317
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:07,763
Look.

318
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,516
There it is.

319
00:31:15,146 --> 00:31:17,188
What's got into him?

320
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:19,440
Must have seen a catfish.

321
00:31:26,615 --> 00:31:28,741
Stupid mongrel!

322
00:31:44,632 --> 00:31:47,301
Come on!

323
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:57,978
- It's ours for the taking.
- Tide's coming in. That should help.

324
00:31:58,062 --> 00:32:00,856
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

325
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:02,815
There's the truth of it!

326
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:13,284
Suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,

327
00:32:13,368 --> 00:32:16,620
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

328
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:19,373
Amen to that.

329
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:37,599
Thank you.

330
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:57,743
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

331
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:00,287
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

332
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,957
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

333
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,169
So he had no choice. He's a captive
as much as the rest of us.

334
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,087
Worse, as it turns out.

335
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:13,966
See, the Pelegostos believe
that Jack is a god in human form,

336
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:15,927
and they intend to do him the honor

337
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:18,638
of releasing him
from his fleshy prison.

338
00:33:23,644 --> 00:33:26,145
They'll roast him and eat him.

339
00:33:27,189 --> 00:33:28,981
Where's the rest of the crew?

340
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:33,652
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

341
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:38,156
The feast is about to begin.

342
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:40,992
Jack's life will end

343
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:43,370
when the drums stop.

344
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,666
Well, we can't just sit here
and wait, then, can we?

345
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,795
No, no. Oi! No, no.

346
00:33:52,838 --> 00:33:56,006
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

347
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:58,217
I am chief. Want big fire.

348
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:00,511
Come on.

349
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,973
...Tout suite.

350
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:06,350
Come on. More wood.

351
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:35,336
Whoa!

352
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,834
Oh, bugger.

353
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:28,678
A little seasoning, eh?

354
00:35:42,484 --> 00:35:44,068
Well done.

355
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:26,817
Put your legs through. Start to climb!

356
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,030
Come on, men! It'll take all of us
to crew the Black Pearl!

357
00:36:32,115 --> 00:36:34,866
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

358
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,286
About six would do.

359
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:42,666
Oh, dear.

360
00:36:46,129 --> 00:36:48,838
- Hurry!
- Come on!

361
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:54,969
Come on! ls that all you got?

362
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:05,187
- Wait. Stop.
- Eh?

363
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:07,940
- Stop.
- Shh, shh.

364
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:16,406
Shh.

365
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:22,454
- What are they doing?
- Stop.

366
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:30,545
Snake! Aaah!

367
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:50,147
Move!

368
00:38:16,422 --> 00:38:18,590
Well, go on, go get them.

369
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:26,431
No, no. Oi! No, no!

370
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:30,435
Not good.

371
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,953
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

372
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,723
Roll the cage!

373
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:12,142
Come on!

374
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,208
Lift the cage! Hurry!

375
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,587
Come on, lads.
Lift it like a lady's skirt.

376
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:39,099
Run!

377
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:54,280
This way, lads!

378
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:19,638
Take cover!

379
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:22,432
Stop it!

380
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:18,986
Bugger.

381
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:49,223
Haul loose the mooring line!

382
00:42:49,308 --> 00:42:51,559
The mooring line!

383
00:42:51,644 --> 00:42:55,313
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

384
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:58,650
- Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!

385
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:01,361
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

386
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:04,863
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

387
00:43:04,948 --> 00:43:07,491
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

388
00:43:07,533 --> 00:43:10,494
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?

389
00:43:10,536 --> 00:43:13,872
- I won't leave without him.
- Oi!

390
00:43:22,048 --> 00:43:24,966
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!

391
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:36,852
- Make ready to cast off!
- Oi!

392
00:43:40,357 --> 00:43:41,691
Good doggy.

393
00:43:58,124 --> 00:44:01,584
Alas, my children, this is the day
you shall always remember

394
00:44:01,669 --> 00:44:03,670
as the day that you almost...

395
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,758
...Captain Jack Sparrow.

396
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:38,786
Let's put some distance between us and
this island and head out to open sea.

397
00:44:38,871 --> 00:44:43,249
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

398
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:45,460
That seems a bit contradictory, captain.

399
00:44:45,502 --> 00:44:48,671
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.

400
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:51,841
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

401
00:44:57,513 --> 00:44:59,931
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

402
00:44:59,974 --> 00:45:02,809
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?

403
00:45:02,852 --> 00:45:05,437
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.

404
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,400
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

405
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:14,195
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

406
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:16,822
I must trade it for her freedom.

407
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:21,827
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain.

408
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,955
We have a need to travel upriver.

409
00:45:24,998 --> 00:45:28,501
By need,
do you mean a trifling need?

410
00:45:28,585 --> 00:45:32,379
Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?

411
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:36,299
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

412
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:40,178
What we need to do is make sail
for Port Royal with all haste.

413
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:42,180
William,

414
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:44,307
I shall trade you the compass

415
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,184
if you will help me

416
00:45:46,268 --> 00:45:48,478
to find this.

417
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,651
- You want me to find this?
- No.

418
00:45:55,778 --> 00:45:58,195
You want you to find this...

419
00:45:58,279 --> 00:46:02,366
...because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

420
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:04,576
and/or locating in your discovering

421
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:08,288
a way to save your dolly belle,
ol' what's-her-face.

422
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,624
Savvy?

423
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,088
This is going to save Elizabeth?

424
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:21,467
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

425
00:46:23,804 --> 00:46:25,388
Not much.

426
00:46:25,472 --> 00:46:28,474
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

427
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:57,335
What's all this?

428
00:46:58,004 --> 00:47:00,839
If you both fancy the dress,
you'll just have to share

429
00:47:00,923 --> 00:47:02,966
and wear it one after the other.

430
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:06,343
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

431
00:47:07,012 --> 00:47:09,263
Is it, now? And you?

432
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:13,517
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

433
00:47:13,602 --> 00:47:16,103
All the men, they can feel it.

434
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:19,940
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

435
00:47:20,025 --> 00:47:22,318
searching for her husband, lost at sea.

436
00:47:22,402 --> 00:47:24,987
A virgin too, likely as not.

437
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:27,322
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

438
00:47:27,406 --> 00:47:31,951
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

439
00:47:31,994 --> 00:47:34,704
No! That will just
anger the spirit, sir.

440
00:47:34,788 --> 00:47:37,457
What we need to do is find out
what the spirit needs,

441
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,000
and then get it back to her.

442
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:41,252
Enough! Enough!

443
00:47:41,295 --> 00:47:45,506
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

444
00:47:45,591 --> 00:47:48,926
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

445
00:47:48,968 --> 00:47:51,261
A young woman, by the look of it.

446
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:53,972
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

447
00:47:54,015 --> 00:47:56,642
Oh, and, uh, she's probably naked.

448
00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:29,173
Why is Jack afraid
of the open ocean?

449
00:48:29,216 --> 00:48:31,634
Well,
if you believe such things,

450
00:48:31,677 --> 00:48:35,095
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones.

451
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:39,766
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

452
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,353
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

453
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,022
The kraken.

454
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:53,405
They say the stench of its breath
is like...

455
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:57,032
imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

456
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:58,701
is the roar of the kraken

457
00:48:58,785 --> 00:49:02,913
and the reeking odor
of a thousand rotting corpses.

458
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,251
If you believe such things.

459
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:09,753
And the key will spare him that?

460
00:49:10,505 --> 00:49:13,966
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

461
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,551
Bad enough even to go visit...

462
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:19,637
...her.

463
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:21,597
Her?

464
00:49:21,682 --> 00:49:23,725
Aye.

465
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:02,428
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

466
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:06,432
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

467
00:50:06,516 --> 00:50:08,893
Were. Have been.

468
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:10,936
Before.

469
00:50:10,979 --> 00:50:14,023
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

470
00:50:14,107 --> 00:50:19,987
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

471
00:50:20,072 --> 00:50:21,280
Mind the boat.

472
00:50:21,323 --> 00:50:23,740
Mind the boat.

473
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:39,506
Jack Sparrow.

474
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,758
Tia Dalma.

475
00:50:42,551 --> 00:50:47,012
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

476
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,644
You...

477
00:50:56,147 --> 00:50:58,774
You have a touch of...

478
00:50:58,817 --> 00:51:02,277
...destiny about you,

479
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,154
William Turner.

480
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:08,116
You know me?

481
00:51:08,158 --> 00:51:10,827
You want to know me.

482
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:12,495
There'll be no knowing here.

483
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:15,540
We've come for help
and we're not leaving without it.

484
00:51:15,624 --> 00:51:19,293
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

485
00:51:19,336 --> 00:51:21,504
- Come.
- Come.

486
00:51:25,175 --> 00:51:29,678
What service may I do you?

487
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:34,349
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment.

488
00:51:37,979 --> 00:51:39,980
Look.

489
00:51:40,022 --> 00:51:43,525
An undead monkey.

490
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:45,819
Top that.

491
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:53,659
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

492
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,662
The payment is fair.

493
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:58,706
We're looking for this.

494
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:04,086
And what it goes to.

495
00:52:05,547 --> 00:52:10,217
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

496
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,720
Maybe. Why?

497
00:52:13,762 --> 00:52:16,097
I hear you.

498
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:20,643
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

499
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:23,605
Or do you know,

500
00:52:23,689 --> 00:52:27,567
but are loath to claim it as your own?

501
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,362
Your key go to a chest.

502
00:52:31,947 --> 00:52:36,450
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

503
00:52:36,534 --> 00:52:39,495
- What is inside?
- Gold?

504
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:43,624
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

505
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:46,919
Nothing bad, I hope?

506
00:52:47,629 --> 00:52:50,547
You know of Davy Jones,

507
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,174
yes?

508
00:52:52,258 --> 00:52:55,052
A man of the sea.

509
00:52:55,094 --> 00:52:57,428
A great sailor,

510
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:02,475
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

511
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,603
What vexes all men?

512
00:53:07,105 --> 00:53:09,607
What indeed?

513
00:53:10,192 --> 00:53:12,235
- The sea.
- Sums.

514
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:14,111
The dichotomy of good and evil.

515
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:19,491
A woman.

516
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:21,701
He fell in love.

517
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:24,788
No, no, no, no. I heard
it was the sea he fell in love with.

518
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:28,792
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

519
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:31,253
See, it was a woman

520
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:34,089
as changing and harsh

521
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:37,551
and untamable as the sea.

522
00:53:37,635 --> 00:53:40,053
Him never stopped loving her.

523
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:44,974
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

524
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:47,726
but not enough to cause him to die.

525
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:53,983
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

526
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:55,985
Him heart.

527
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,195
Literally or figuratively?

528
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,824
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

529
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:04,909
Could he?

530
00:54:04,994 --> 00:54:10,248
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

531
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,834
And so...

532
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:15,587
...him carve out him heart,

533
00:54:16,213 --> 00:54:20,883
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

534
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,845
The key,

535
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:28,515
he keep with him at all times.

536
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:31,018
- You knew this.
- I did not.

537
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,687
I didn't know where the key was.
But now we do.

538
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:37,232
All that's left is climb aboard
the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,

539
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:40,027
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass.

540
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:41,903
Let me see your hand.

541
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,003
The black spot!

542
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,549
- The black spot!
- Black spot!

543
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,053
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

544
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,597
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

545
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,562
My little beauty,
where are you?

546
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,191
Such a long time in such a mess.

547
00:55:23,235 --> 00:55:26,154
Davy Jones cannot make port.

548
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:29,574
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

549
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,327
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

550
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:35,954
and so you will carry land with you.

551
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:47,257
Dirt.

552
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:51,970
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

553
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:57,266
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

554
00:55:57,309 --> 00:56:00,269
If you don't want it, give it back.

555
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:03,940
- No.
- Then it helps.

556
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:11,197
It seems we have a need
to find the Flying Dutchman.

557
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:18,120
A touch of destiny.

558
00:56:33,553 --> 00:56:35,137
That's the Flying Dutchman?

559
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:40,850
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

560
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:43,310
Do not underestimate her.

561
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:49,150
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

562
00:56:49,234 --> 00:56:52,737
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

563
00:56:52,821 --> 00:56:55,156
And if there are crewmen?

564
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,533
I cut down anyone in my path.

565
00:56:58,326 --> 00:57:01,286
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

566
00:57:01,328 --> 00:57:04,330
Your chariot awaits you, sire.

567
00:57:07,585 --> 00:57:08,752
Oi!

568
00:57:08,836 --> 00:57:10,837
If you do happen to get captured,

569
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,632
just say Jack Sparrow
sent you to settle his debt.

570
00:57:14,675 --> 00:57:19,095
- It might save your life.
- Bon voyage!

571
00:57:22,557 --> 00:57:25,184
Douse the lamps.

572
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:07,891
Sailor.

573
00:58:07,975 --> 00:58:10,560
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!

574
00:58:10,645 --> 00:58:13,063
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

575
00:58:13,105 --> 00:58:15,857
There's no use. You've run aground.

576
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,317
No.

577
00:58:17,401 --> 00:58:19,569
Beneath us.

578
00:58:20,404 --> 00:58:22,781
Foul breath.

579
00:58:35,377 --> 00:58:37,920
Hey! Hey!

580
00:59:15,331 --> 00:59:18,166
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

581
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:37,018
Get back! Get back!

582
01:00:08,633 --> 01:00:12,302
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

583
01:00:29,444 --> 01:00:32,613
Do you fear death?

584
01:00:34,032 --> 01:00:38,869
Do you fear that dark abyss?

585
01:00:40,746 --> 01:00:43,539
All your deeds laid bare.

586
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:47,794
All your sins punished.

587
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:51,756
I can offer you

588
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,300
an escape.

589
01:00:54,385 --> 01:00:56,052
Don't listen to him!

590
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:09,106
Do you not fear death?

591
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,194
I'll take my chances, sir.

592
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,697
To the depths.

593
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,203
Cruel blackguard!

594
01:01:24,246 --> 01:01:26,455
Life is cruel.

595
01:01:27,374 --> 01:01:30,126
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

596
01:01:30,669 --> 01:01:33,838
I offer you a choice.

597
01:01:33,922 --> 01:01:36,590
Join my crew

598
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:39,051
and postpone the judgment.

599
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:43,931
One hundred years before the mast.

600
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:48,184
Will ye serve?

601
01:01:50,021 --> 01:01:52,022
I will serve.

602
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:54,524
There.

603
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:04,951
You are neither dead nor dying.

604
01:02:04,994 --> 01:02:06,619
What is your purpose here?

605
01:02:10,415 --> 01:02:13,584
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

606
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:17,963
What is your purpose here?

607
01:02:18,048 --> 01:02:21,300
Jack Sparrow...
sent me to settle his debt.

608
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,805
Did he, now?

609
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:30,349
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

610
01:02:45,824 --> 01:02:46,824
Oh.

611
01:02:47,284 --> 01:02:50,078
You have a debt to pay.

612
01:02:50,162 --> 01:02:53,580
You've been captain
of the Black Pearl for 13 years.

613
01:02:53,664 --> 01:02:55,749
That was our agreement.

614
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:59,669
Technically, I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

615
01:02:59,754 --> 01:03:03,548
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

616
01:03:03,633 --> 01:03:06,968
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

617
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:09,554
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

618
01:03:12,517 --> 01:03:15,476
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.

619
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:18,687
- One soul is not equal to another.
- Aha!

620
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:21,607
We've established my proposal
is sound in principle.

621
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:23,609
Now we're haggling over price.

622
01:03:25,529 --> 01:03:28,114
Price?

623
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:33,661
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

624
01:03:37,373 --> 01:03:40,917
One hundred souls.

625
01:03:41,001 --> 01:03:42,752
Three days.

626
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:47,132
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

627
01:03:47,216 --> 01:03:50,343
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

628
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:53,429
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

629
01:03:56,142 --> 01:03:58,183
Have you not met Will Turner?

630
01:03:58,226 --> 01:04:01,061
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

631
01:04:01,146 --> 01:04:03,522
Worth at least four.

632
01:04:03,565 --> 01:04:05,858
Maybe three and a half.

633
01:04:06,651 --> 01:04:09,653
And did I happen to mention...

634
01:04:09,737 --> 01:04:12,239
...he's in love?

635
01:04:13,074 --> 01:04:15,659
With a girl.

636
01:04:15,743 --> 01:04:18,162
Due to be married.

637
01:04:18,246 --> 01:04:20,246
Betrothed.

638
01:04:21,165 --> 01:04:25,918
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

639
01:04:25,961 --> 01:04:29,964
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony.

640
01:04:30,048 --> 01:04:32,049
Eh?

641
01:04:34,803 --> 01:04:39,724
I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls.

642
01:04:39,766 --> 01:04:42,434
But I wonder, Sparrow,

643
01:04:42,518 --> 01:04:44,769
can you live with this?

644
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:49,316
Can you condemn
an innocent man, a friend,

645
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:54,404
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

646
01:04:57,617 --> 01:04:59,618
Yep. I'm good with it.

647
01:04:59,702 --> 01:05:02,871
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.

648
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:09,167
Three days.

649
01:05:24,184 --> 01:05:27,143
- Uh, Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye.

650
01:05:27,186 --> 01:05:29,812
I feel sullied and unusual.

651
01:05:29,897 --> 01:05:35,693
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

652
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:40,490
Fortunately, he was mum as to the
condition in which these souls need be.

653
01:05:40,532 --> 01:05:41,824
Ah.

654
01:05:41,909 --> 01:05:46,412
Tortuga.

655
01:05:50,416 --> 01:05:54,044
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

656
01:05:54,128 --> 01:05:57,381
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

657
01:05:57,465 --> 01:06:01,843
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

658
01:06:01,886 --> 01:06:06,390
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is the only
free port left in these waters.

659
01:06:06,474 --> 01:06:09,101
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

660
01:06:09,185 --> 01:06:10,851
An honest sailor is what I am.

661
01:06:10,936 --> 01:06:14,647
I make my living fair
and I sleep well each night.

662
01:06:15,357 --> 01:06:17,275
Sir!

663
01:06:40,548 --> 01:06:43,091
She wants you to do something.

664
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:48,888
She's trying to give a sign.

665
01:06:52,935 --> 01:06:54,435
Whoa!

666
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,732
Over there! Look for a sign!

667
01:07:04,529 --> 01:07:06,697
Look, there! There it is!

668
01:07:07,198 --> 01:07:09,742
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.

669
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:12,911
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

670
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:16,080
- That would be a bad sign.
- What's that over there?

671
01:07:36,393 --> 01:07:40,103
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

672
01:07:40,146 --> 01:07:41,938
I've never sailed a day in me life.

673
01:07:42,023 --> 01:07:45,233
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

674
01:07:45,276 --> 01:07:48,612
You'll do. Make your mark. Next!

675
01:07:48,696 --> 01:07:51,448
My wife ran off with my dog

676
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:54,368
and I'm drunk for a month

677
01:07:54,452 --> 01:07:56,495
and I don't give an ass rat's

678
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:58,622
if I live or die.

679
01:07:58,664 --> 01:08:01,707
- Perfect. Next!
- I know what I want...

680
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:05,920
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow's-nest for you.

681
01:08:05,962 --> 01:08:08,130
- I know what I want.
- Next!

682
01:08:08,173 --> 01:08:10,257
Ever since I was a little lad,

683
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,844
I've always wanted
to sail the seas... forever.

684
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:16,639
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

685
01:08:16,723 --> 01:08:19,016
Thanks very much.

686
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:20,434
How we going?

687
01:08:20,477 --> 01:08:24,270
Including those four,
that gives us... four.

688
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:29,901
And what's your story?

689
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,487
My story.

690
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:37,659
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

691
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:41,371
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

692
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:44,331
The pursuit cost me my crew,

693
01:08:44,374 --> 01:08:47,042
my commission,

694
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:49,294
and my life.

695
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:57,594
- Commodore?
- Not any more. Weren't you listening?

696
01:09:02,183 --> 01:09:04,768
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

697
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,022
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.

698
01:09:10,107 --> 01:09:11,524
Lord.

699
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,609
You didn't try to sail through it?

700
01:09:13,694 --> 01:09:16,237
So do I make your crew

701
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:18,322
or not?

702
01:09:19,158 --> 01:09:21,993
You haven't said where you're going.

703
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:24,036
Somewhere nice?!

704
01:09:24,121 --> 01:09:27,540
So am I worthy to serve

705
01:09:27,624 --> 01:09:30,375
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

706
01:09:32,879 --> 01:09:36,256
Or should I just kill you now?

707
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,598
You're hired.

708
01:09:44,682 --> 01:09:48,727
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

709
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:52,313
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

710
01:10:05,494 --> 01:10:07,495
- Time to go.
- Aye!

711
01:10:52,121 --> 01:10:53,872
- Thanks, mate.
- Aaah!

712
01:10:59,836 --> 01:11:01,170
Carry on.

713
01:11:09,054 --> 01:11:11,639
Come on, then! Who wants some?

714
01:11:11,682 --> 01:11:15,226
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

715
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,603
Come on, who's first?

716
01:11:20,273 --> 01:11:23,066
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

717
01:11:50,427 --> 01:11:53,137
James Norrington.

718
01:11:53,179 --> 01:11:57,057
What has the world done to you?

719
01:12:25,251 --> 01:12:27,544
Heave!

720
01:12:27,754 --> 01:12:29,354
Heave!

721
01:12:35,845 --> 01:12:39,306
- Heave!
- Heave!

722
01:12:42,226 --> 01:12:46,187
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner!

723
01:12:49,232 --> 01:12:51,400
Step to it!

724
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:59,575
- Step aside.
- Hey! Mind yourself!

725
01:13:00,035 --> 01:13:02,453
Let go, boy!

726
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:07,249
No.

727
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,801
Haul that weevil to his feet.

728
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:26,893
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!

729
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:32,106
- No!
- Impeding me in my duties?

730
01:13:32,148 --> 01:13:35,943
- You'll share the punishment.
- I'll take it all.

731
01:13:36,027 --> 01:13:38,487
Will you, now?

732
01:13:38,571 --> 01:13:43,784
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

733
01:13:47,539 --> 01:13:49,456
My son.

734
01:13:54,378 --> 01:13:56,754
He's my son.

735
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:11,185
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

736
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:15,147
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

737
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:22,612
No. No, I won't!

738
01:14:22,655 --> 01:14:25,449
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.

739
01:14:25,491 --> 01:14:27,659
Your issue will feel its sting,

740
01:14:27,744 --> 01:14:31,329
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.

741
01:14:35,168 --> 01:14:37,543
No.

742
01:14:37,627 --> 01:14:39,670
- Bosun!
- No!

743
01:15:23,838 --> 01:15:27,216
You had it easy, boy!

744
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,302
- Will.
- I don't need your help.

745
01:15:32,055 --> 01:15:37,059
The bosun prides himself on cleaving
flesh from bone, with every swing.

746
01:15:38,478 --> 01:15:43,439
So I'm to understand what you did
was an act of compassion?

747
01:15:43,524 --> 01:15:44,607
Yes.

748
01:15:51,573 --> 01:15:57,495
One hundred years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,

749
01:15:57,579 --> 01:16:00,498
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.

750
01:16:03,252 --> 01:16:07,254
Once you've sworn an oath to
the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

751
01:16:07,338 --> 01:16:09,297
Not until your debt is paid.

752
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:12,968
I've sworn no oath.

753
01:16:14,762 --> 01:16:16,930
You must get away.

754
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:20,100
Not until I find this.

755
01:16:21,769 --> 01:16:23,854
The key.

756
01:16:30,861 --> 01:16:33,279
The dead man's chest.

757
01:16:34,447 --> 01:16:36,615
What do you know of this?

758
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:41,370
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

759
01:16:41,454 --> 01:16:44,623
No, don't stab the heart.

760
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:49,711
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

761
01:16:49,795 --> 01:16:54,132
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

762
01:16:54,508 --> 01:16:57,093
So the captain has the key?

763
01:16:58,304 --> 01:17:01,014
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

764
01:17:01,098 --> 01:17:04,309
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.

765
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:09,272
Captain Sparrow!

766
01:17:09,315 --> 01:17:11,815
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

767
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,610
I'm here to find the man I love.

768
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:20,073
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

769
01:17:21,284 --> 01:17:25,329
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

770
01:17:25,371 --> 01:17:26,788
Elizabeth.

771
01:17:26,873 --> 01:17:28,874
Hide the rum.

772
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:32,627
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.

773
01:17:32,669 --> 01:17:35,379
- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

774
01:17:37,633 --> 01:17:40,843
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

775
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:44,513
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but...

776
01:17:44,556 --> 01:17:48,267
...through an unfortunate
series of circumstances

777
01:17:48,352 --> 01:17:51,520
that had nothing
whatsoever to do with me,

778
01:17:51,563 --> 01:17:56,316
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.

779
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,277
Davy Jones?

780
01:18:00,696 --> 01:18:03,073
Oh, please.

781
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,660
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?

782
01:18:06,702 --> 01:18:08,870
You look awful.
What are you doing here?

783
01:18:08,913 --> 01:18:10,121
You hired me.

784
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:12,457
I can't help it
if your standards are lax.

785
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:14,209
- You smell funny.
- Jack!

786
01:18:14,251 --> 01:18:17,544
- Huh?
- All I want is to find Will.

787
01:18:17,629 --> 01:18:19,630
Well...

788
01:18:21,967 --> 01:18:26,470
Are you certain?
ls that what you really want most?

789
01:18:27,389 --> 01:18:29,723
Of course.

790
01:18:29,808 --> 01:18:34,061
Because I would think you'd want
to find a way to save Will most.

791
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:38,564
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well...

792
01:18:38,649 --> 01:18:41,901
...there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.

793
01:18:41,986 --> 01:18:44,362
A chest of unknown size and origin.

794
01:18:44,405 --> 01:18:48,366
What contains the still-beating
heart of Davy Jones.

795
01:18:50,786 --> 01:18:52,620
And whoever possesses that chest

796
01:18:52,705 --> 01:18:56,749
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

797
01:18:56,792 --> 01:19:01,628
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

798
01:19:01,713 --> 01:19:05,340
You don't actually believe him, do you?

799
01:19:10,096 --> 01:19:12,431
How would we find it?

800
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,435
With this.

801
01:19:16,477 --> 01:19:19,438
My compass... is unique.

802
01:19:19,981 --> 01:19:23,149
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken."

803
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:28,612
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

804
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:33,617
Where does it point?

805
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:38,497
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

806
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,169
Oh, Jack.

807
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:48,965
- Are you telling the truth?
- Every word, love.

808
01:19:49,008 --> 01:19:51,468
And what you want most in this world

809
01:19:52,344 --> 01:19:57,307
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

810
01:19:57,349 --> 01:20:02,353
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

811
01:20:17,994 --> 01:20:20,329
- Mr. Gibbs!
- Cap'n.

812
01:20:20,371 --> 01:20:22,539
- We have our heading.
- Finally!

813
01:20:22,624 --> 01:20:27,211
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

814
01:20:27,295 --> 01:20:28,504
Miss Swann.

815
01:20:31,548 --> 01:20:35,009
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

816
01:20:41,642 --> 01:20:43,351
There's something to knowing

817
01:20:43,435 --> 01:20:46,521
the exact shape of the world
and one's place in it.

818
01:20:46,563 --> 01:20:49,315
I assure you, these are not necessary.

819
01:20:49,358 --> 01:20:53,777
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

820
01:20:53,861 --> 01:20:57,489
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on Tortuga,

821
01:20:57,532 --> 01:21:01,493
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

822
01:21:01,536 --> 01:21:04,496
and other fugitives from justice.

823
01:21:04,539 --> 01:21:06,373
"Justice"? Hardly.

824
01:21:06,457 --> 01:21:11,253
Including the previous owner
of this sword, I believe.

825
01:21:12,754 --> 01:21:14,338
Our ships are in pursuit.

826
01:21:14,381 --> 01:21:17,550
Justice will be dispensed
by cannonade and cutlass,

827
01:21:17,592 --> 01:21:21,554
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

828
01:21:21,638 --> 01:21:24,431
I find it distasteful
to even contemplate

829
01:21:24,516 --> 01:21:27,643
the horror facing all those on board.

830
01:21:30,939 --> 01:21:32,815
What do you want from me?

831
01:21:32,899 --> 01:21:36,025
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

832
01:21:36,068 --> 01:21:39,737
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

833
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:43,283
To you, you mean.

834
01:21:46,912 --> 01:21:49,664
Shall I remove these shackles?

835
01:21:52,918 --> 01:21:54,961
Do what you can for my daughter.

836
01:22:02,594 --> 01:22:07,514
So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

837
01:22:07,599 --> 01:22:11,351
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

838
01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:20,276
I wager... ten years.

839
01:22:21,153 --> 01:22:23,529
I'll match ten years.

840
01:22:24,489 --> 01:22:26,240
Agreed.

841
01:22:28,118 --> 01:22:31,954
Wondering how it's played?

842
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:33,956
- I understand.
- Liar!

843
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:35,791
It's a game of deception.

844
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:39,587
But your bet includes all the dice,
not just your own.

845
01:22:39,963 --> 01:22:43,048
- What are they wagering?
- Oh, the only thing we have.

846
01:22:43,132 --> 01:22:45,467
Years of service.

847
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:51,806
- Any crew member can be challenged?
- Aye. Anyone.

848
01:22:54,685 --> 01:22:57,437
I challenge Davy Jones.

849
01:23:17,082 --> 01:23:20,042
I accept, mate.

850
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:37,183
- The stakes?
- My soul. An eternity of servitude.

851
01:23:37,268 --> 01:23:39,519
No!

852
01:23:41,689 --> 01:23:43,189
Against?

853
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:46,693
I want this.

854
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:03,709
- How do you know of the key?
- That's not part of the game, is it?

855
01:24:06,879 --> 01:24:08,463
You can still walk away.

856
01:24:34,155 --> 01:24:37,240
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

857
01:24:37,366 --> 01:24:40,243
No! Don't do this.

858
01:24:42,204 --> 01:24:43,955
The die is cast.

859
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:48,126
I bid three twos.

860
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:50,420
It's your bid, captain.

861
01:24:56,718 --> 01:24:59,678
Four fours.

862
01:25:08,772 --> 01:25:09,938
Four fives.

863
01:25:12,067 --> 01:25:13,734
Six threes.

864
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:26,537
Seven fives.

865
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,812
Eight fives.

866
01:25:57,443 --> 01:26:00,945
Welcome to the crew, lad.

867
01:26:02,989 --> 01:26:04,740
Twelve fives.

868
01:26:06,368 --> 01:26:08,035
Twelve fives.

869
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,996
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

870
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:15,876
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

871
01:26:19,339 --> 01:26:24,217
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you
will spend an eternity on this ship.

872
01:26:26,137 --> 01:26:30,348
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore...

873
01:26:31,642 --> 01:26:34,769
...the very next time we make port!

874
01:26:42,361 --> 01:26:45,904
Fool. Why did you do that?

875
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:49,658
I couldn't let you lose.

876
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:52,536
It was never about winning or losing.

877
01:26:54,873 --> 01:26:56,331
The key.

878
01:26:58,042 --> 01:27:00,878
You just wanted to know where it was.

879
01:27:20,481 --> 01:27:23,107
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

880
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:29,237
Captain's orders.

881
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:21,636
Here. Take this too.

882
01:29:22,555 --> 01:29:25,932
Now get yourself to land,
and stay there.

883
01:29:26,392 --> 01:29:29,686
It was always in my blood
to die at sea.

884
01:29:29,729 --> 01:29:32,772
It was not a fate
I ever wanted for you.

885
01:29:37,236 --> 01:29:41,238
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

886
01:29:41,323 --> 01:29:45,159
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,

887
01:29:45,201 --> 01:29:47,536
when I left you to go pirating.

888
01:29:48,496 --> 01:29:52,791
But it would taste a lie to say
it wasn't what I wanted.

889
01:29:54,502 --> 01:29:57,171
You owe me nothing, Will.

890
01:29:57,213 --> 01:29:58,422
Now go.

891
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:03,301
They'll know you helped me.

892
01:30:04,637 --> 01:30:06,638
What more can they do to me?

893
01:30:12,478 --> 01:30:14,729
I take this with a promise.

894
01:30:14,813 --> 01:30:17,231
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

895
01:30:17,316 --> 01:30:20,234
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

896
01:30:22,738 --> 01:30:25,072
I will not abandon you.

897
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:29,242
I promise.

898
01:30:44,425 --> 01:30:46,425
- Beckett?
- Yes, they're signed.

899
01:30:46,468 --> 01:30:49,261
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

900
01:30:49,304 --> 01:30:50,763
Blaah!

901
01:30:50,806 --> 01:30:54,475
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

902
01:30:54,559 --> 01:30:58,729
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

903
01:30:58,772 --> 01:31:01,315
Of course.

904
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:05,152
- He wants the chest.
- He did say something about a chest.

905
01:31:05,237 --> 01:31:08,863
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

906
01:31:08,948 --> 01:31:12,701
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

907
01:31:12,785 --> 01:31:16,454
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

908
01:31:16,539 --> 01:31:19,791
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

909
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:22,001
Brace the foreyard!

910
01:31:22,086 --> 01:31:25,296
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

911
01:31:25,381 --> 01:31:27,340
- Persuasion.
- Friendly?

912
01:31:27,425 --> 01:31:29,092
Decidedly not.

913
01:31:29,135 --> 01:31:31,135
Will strikes a deal for these,

914
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:34,680
yet you were the one
with the prize... full pardon.

915
01:31:34,764 --> 01:31:37,307
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

916
01:31:37,392 --> 01:31:39,935
and the East India Trading Company."

917
01:31:39,978 --> 01:31:42,312
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

918
01:31:42,355 --> 01:31:44,857
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No.

919
01:31:44,983 --> 01:31:47,317
Persuade me.

920
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,155
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

921
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:57,243
As I said, persuade me.

922
01:32:11,508 --> 01:32:14,009
It's a curious thing.

923
01:32:15,052 --> 01:32:18,096
There was a time I would have
wanted you to look like that

924
01:32:18,181 --> 01:32:20,724
while thinking about me.

925
01:32:20,808 --> 01:32:23,143
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

926
01:32:23,186 --> 01:32:26,104
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

927
01:32:30,777 --> 01:32:33,195
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancé

928
01:32:33,237 --> 01:32:37,198
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?

929
01:33:01,722 --> 01:33:05,016
Strange to come upon a longboat
so far out in open waters.

930
01:33:05,059 --> 01:33:08,520
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

931
01:33:08,562 --> 01:33:11,648
And what are we running from?

932
01:33:16,529 --> 01:33:19,280
That dress. Where did you get it?

933
01:33:19,365 --> 01:33:21,073
It was found aboard the ship.

934
01:33:21,157 --> 01:33:25,702
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

935
01:33:25,745 --> 01:33:29,164
- That's foolish.
- Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

936
01:33:29,249 --> 01:33:31,375
It brought good fortune.

937
01:33:31,417 --> 01:33:35,254
The spirit told us,
"Pull in at Tortuga,"

938
01:33:35,338 --> 01:33:37,339
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

939
01:33:37,423 --> 01:33:40,592
Off the books, of course.

940
01:33:40,635 --> 01:33:44,428
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

941
01:33:44,513 --> 01:33:47,431
- Why do you ask?
- Captain! A ship's been spotted.

942
01:33:47,474 --> 01:33:50,309
- Colors?
- She isn't flying any.

943
01:33:50,394 --> 01:33:52,395
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

944
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:06,533
You will watch this.

945
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:17,627
Let no joyful voice be heard!

946
01:34:19,714 --> 01:34:22,966
Let no man look up at the sky
with hope.

947
01:34:25,177 --> 01:34:27,636
And let this day be cursed

948
01:34:27,721 --> 01:34:30,723
by we who ready to wake...

949
01:34:32,392 --> 01:34:34,518
...the kraken.

950
01:34:34,603 --> 01:34:36,645
No!

951
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:56,122
I've doomed us all.

952
01:34:56,498 --> 01:34:59,375
It's the Flying Dutchman!

953
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:06,758
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

954
01:35:06,842 --> 01:35:08,217
Must have hit a reef.

955
01:35:16,976 --> 01:35:20,020
Free the rudder! Hard to port
then hard to starboard.

956
01:35:20,063 --> 01:35:23,607
- Free the rudder!
- Hard to port!

957
01:35:30,865 --> 01:35:34,367
- Kraken!
- Kraken!

958
01:35:47,839 --> 01:35:50,841
Here it is! Take it!

959
01:35:50,884 --> 01:35:52,927
Take it!

960
01:38:04,804 --> 01:38:09,348
The boy's not here. He must
have been claimed by the sea.

961
01:38:09,432 --> 01:38:11,934
I am the sea.

962
01:38:15,647 --> 01:38:18,857
You need time alone with your thoughts.

963
01:38:18,942 --> 01:38:21,527
- Brig!
- What of the survivors?

964
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:30,368
There are no survivors.

965
01:38:50,555 --> 01:38:54,432
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

966
01:38:54,517 --> 01:38:57,227
Get me there first,
or there'll be the devil to pay.

967
01:38:57,311 --> 01:38:59,146
"First"?

968
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:02,440
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

969
01:39:02,525 --> 01:39:04,526
Who told him of the key?

970
01:39:07,655 --> 01:39:09,781
Jack Sparrow.

971
01:39:28,175 --> 01:39:30,509
My intuitive sense
of the female creature

972
01:39:30,594 --> 01:39:32,928
informs me that you are troubled.

973
01:39:35,014 --> 01:39:38,433
I just thought I'd be married by now.

974
01:39:38,517 --> 01:39:40,810
I'm so ready to be married.

975
01:39:48,444 --> 01:39:50,445
You know...

976
01:39:52,114 --> 01:39:57,492
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,

977
01:39:57,577 --> 01:39:59,453
and being captain of a ship,

978
01:39:59,495 --> 01:40:03,457
I could in fact
perform a "marr-I-age"...

979
01:40:04,292 --> 01:40:06,084
...right here.

980
01:40:06,127 --> 01:40:08,545
Right on this deck.

981
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:10,631
Right... now.

982
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:16,511
No, thank you.

983
01:40:16,596 --> 01:40:18,137
Why not?

984
01:40:18,222 --> 01:40:21,307
We are very much alike,
you and I. I and you. Us.

985
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:26,437
Oh. Except for a sense of honor
and decency and a moral center.

986
01:40:26,939 --> 01:40:29,774
And personal hygiene.

987
01:40:30,817 --> 01:40:33,110
Trifles.

988
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:35,780
You will come over to my side.
I know it.

989
01:40:35,822 --> 01:40:37,990
You seem very certain.

990
01:40:38,033 --> 01:40:41,117
One word, love. Curiosity.

991
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,827
You long for freedom.

992
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:45,997
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

993
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:49,167
To act on selfish impulse.

994
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:52,003
You want to see what it's like.

995
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:56,508
One day, you won't be able to resist.

996
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:59,344
Why doesn't your compass work?

997
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:04,348
My compass works fine.

998
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:06,600
Because you and I are alike,

999
01:41:06,685 --> 01:41:09,979
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

1000
01:41:10,021 --> 01:41:13,357
- To do the right thing.
- I love those moments.

1001
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:16,110
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

1002
01:41:16,194 --> 01:41:18,696
You'll have the chance
to do something...

1003
01:41:18,738 --> 01:41:21,782
Something courageous.

1004
01:41:21,866 --> 01:41:25,034
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

1005
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:27,704
That you're a good man.

1006
01:41:27,746 --> 01:41:30,290
All evidence to the contrary.

1007
01:41:30,374 --> 01:41:33,376
Oh, I have faith in you.

1008
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:36,421
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

1009
01:41:38,215 --> 01:41:41,217
Curiosity.

1010
01:41:41,302 --> 01:41:44,262
You're going to want it.

1011
01:41:44,346 --> 01:41:48,140
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

1012
01:41:49,559 --> 01:41:51,727
You won't be able to resist.

1013
01:41:53,062 --> 01:41:58,275
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

1014
01:42:00,862 --> 01:42:03,697
I do want to know what it tastes like.

1015
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:05,824
But, seeing as you're a good man,

1016
01:42:05,908 --> 01:42:08,200
I know that you'd never
put me in a position

1017
01:42:08,243 --> 01:42:10,244
that would compromise my honor.

1018
01:42:18,587 --> 01:42:20,671
I'm proud of you, Jack.

1019
01:42:20,756 --> 01:42:24,467
Land, ho!

1020
01:42:28,764 --> 01:42:30,513
I want my jar of dirt.

1021
01:42:32,058 --> 01:42:34,976
- You're pulling too fast.
- You're pulling too slow.

1022
01:42:35,061 --> 01:42:37,145
We don't want the kraken to catch us.

1023
01:42:37,229 --> 01:42:40,148
I'm saving me strength
for when it comes.

1024
01:42:40,232 --> 01:42:42,484
And I don't think
it's "kracken" anyways.

1025
01:42:42,568 --> 01:42:44,694
I always heard it said "krayken".

1026
01:42:44,779 --> 01:42:46,404
- With a long A?
- Uh-huh.

1027
01:42:46,447 --> 01:42:50,325
No, no, no, no, no. "Krocken" is
how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

1028
01:42:50,409 --> 01:42:52,159
and "kracken" is closer to that.

1029
01:42:52,243 --> 01:42:55,746
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

1030
01:42:55,789 --> 01:42:58,999
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

1031
01:43:02,462 --> 01:43:04,630
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

1032
01:43:04,714 --> 01:43:07,091
Don't touch my dirt.

1033
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:43,834
This doesn't work.

1034
01:43:43,876 --> 01:43:46,711
And it certainly doesn't show you
what you want most.

1035
01:43:52,343 --> 01:43:55,679
- Yes, it does.
- You're sitting on it.

1036
01:43:56,556 --> 01:43:58,264
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

1037
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:09,024
- "Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
- I could join the circus.

1038
01:44:09,067 --> 01:44:10,443
Mind if I shine your shoes?

1039
01:44:14,865 --> 01:44:19,618
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

1040
01:44:19,703 --> 01:44:21,703
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

1041
01:44:21,787 --> 01:44:25,081
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

1042
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:29,752
- Down, then!
- Down!

1043
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:40,487
It's real.

1044
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:44,574
You actually were telling the truth.

1045
01:45:44,617 --> 01:45:48,203
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

1046
01:45:48,287 --> 01:45:51,163
With good reason!

1047
01:45:51,248 --> 01:45:53,666
Will!

1048
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:57,586
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

1049
01:46:03,635 --> 01:46:05,761
How did you get here?

1050
01:46:05,804 --> 01:46:09,807
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

1051
01:46:09,849 --> 01:46:11,766
Not so easy, is it?

1052
01:46:11,809 --> 01:46:14,477
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

1053
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:18,648
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

1054
01:46:18,732 --> 01:46:20,817
- What?
- What?

1055
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,028
...I was reunited with my father.

1056
01:46:24,113 --> 01:46:26,823
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.

1057
01:46:27,324 --> 01:46:31,160
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

1058
01:46:31,245 --> 01:46:32,786
Pretty much.

1059
01:46:32,829 --> 01:46:35,205
Time and tide, love.

1060
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:37,541
Oi! What are you doing?

1061
01:46:38,668 --> 01:46:41,003
I'm going to kill Jones.

1062
01:46:42,005 --> 01:46:44,339
Can't let you do that, William.

1063
01:46:44,382 --> 01:46:45,799
'Cause if Jones is dead,

1064
01:46:45,842 --> 01:46:50,512
who's to call his terrible beastie
off the hunt, eh?

1065
01:46:56,518 --> 01:46:59,854
Now, if you please.

1066
01:47:00,522 --> 01:47:03,024
The key.

1067
01:47:05,193 --> 01:47:07,903
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

1068
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:11,365
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

1069
01:47:11,408 --> 01:47:15,077
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

1070
01:47:15,162 --> 01:47:17,412
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1071
01:47:19,624 --> 01:47:23,585
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

1072
01:47:23,669 --> 01:47:26,838
I deliver it, I get my life back.

1073
01:47:26,881 --> 01:47:29,883
Ah. The dark side of ambition.

1074
01:47:29,967 --> 01:47:33,803
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

1075
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:39,642
Stop it!

1076
01:47:46,358 --> 01:47:47,816
Will!

1077
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:51,987
- Guard the chest!
- No!

1078
01:47:52,072 --> 01:47:56,950
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...

1079
01:47:57,035 --> 01:47:58,702
Oh, fine!

1080
01:47:58,745 --> 01:48:02,580
Let's just haul out our swords and
start banging away at each other.

1081
01:48:02,623 --> 01:48:05,249
That will solve everything! I've had it!

1082
01:48:05,334 --> 01:48:10,296
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

1083
01:48:12,925 --> 01:48:14,717
How'd this go all screwy?

1084
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:18,137
Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

1085
01:48:18,222 --> 01:48:21,349
Mr. Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honor,

1086
01:48:21,433 --> 01:48:24,017
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

1087
01:48:24,102 --> 01:48:28,230
then Turner there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

1088
01:48:28,272 --> 01:48:31,942
'twixt him and his
twice-cursed pirate father.

1089
01:48:31,984 --> 01:48:33,944
- Sad.
- This is madness!

1090
01:48:34,028 --> 01:48:37,864
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

1091
01:48:37,949 --> 01:48:39,825
Terrible temptation.

1092
01:48:39,909 --> 01:48:42,160
If we was any kind of decent,

1093
01:48:42,245 --> 01:48:45,955
we'd remove temptation
from their path.

1094
01:48:51,586 --> 01:48:53,421
Enough!

1095
01:48:56,883 --> 01:48:59,677
Oh. Oh!

1096
01:48:59,761 --> 01:49:02,346
The heat!

1097
01:49:21,323 --> 01:49:22,323
Bugger!

1098
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:38,130
By your leave, Mr. Turner.

1099
01:50:16,667 --> 01:50:17,876
Aaaah!

1100
01:50:25,051 --> 01:50:28,136
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.

1101
01:51:20,228 --> 01:51:23,230
Do excuse me while I kill the man
who ruined my life.

1102
01:51:23,273 --> 01:51:27,317
- Be my guest.
- Let us examine that claim a moment.

1103
01:51:27,777 --> 01:51:30,279
Who was it,
that at the very moment

1104
01:51:30,321 --> 01:51:33,240
you had a notorious pirate
safely behind bars,

1105
01:51:33,283 --> 01:51:35,993
saw fit to free said pirate

1106
01:51:36,077 --> 01:51:39,621
and take your dearly beloved
all to hisself?

1107
01:51:39,664 --> 01:51:41,163
Eh?

1108
01:51:41,248 --> 01:51:43,791
So whose fault is it, really,

1109
01:51:43,876 --> 01:51:46,294
that you've ended up
a rum-pot deckhand

1110
01:51:46,336 --> 01:51:48,296
what takes orders from pirates?

1111
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,714
Enough!

1112
01:51:52,634 --> 01:51:56,470
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!

1113
01:51:58,432 --> 01:52:00,308
Still rooting for you, mate.

1114
01:52:06,814 --> 01:52:08,899
Whoa! Oof!

1115
01:52:11,068 --> 01:52:12,068
Oh.

1116
01:52:58,489 --> 01:53:01,282
We got it! We got it! We got it!

1117
01:53:15,672 --> 01:53:17,381
Hello, poppet.

1118
01:53:45,534 --> 01:53:47,493
Come on, run!

1119
01:54:30,285 --> 01:54:32,286
- Sword!
- Sword! Sword!

1120
01:54:35,206 --> 01:54:37,790
Sword!

1121
01:55:18,456 --> 01:55:21,123
Follow my voice. Follow my voice.

1122
01:55:21,166 --> 01:55:23,459
To the left... no, turn around.

1123
01:55:23,502 --> 01:55:25,586
Go to the right.

1124
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:28,339
No, that's a tree.

1125
01:55:28,381 --> 01:55:29,757
Oh, shut it.

1126
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:21,723
Jar of dirt!

1127
01:57:21,364 --> 01:57:22,656
Right.

1128
01:57:56,981 --> 01:57:59,233
We've got it!

1129
01:58:08,952 --> 01:58:11,954
Come on, Turner!

1130
01:58:28,095 --> 01:58:31,722
Leave him lie! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.

1131
01:58:32,724 --> 01:58:35,768
- We're not getting out of this.
- Not with the chest.

1132
01:58:35,852 --> 01:58:37,853
Into the boat.

1133
01:58:37,896 --> 01:58:40,021
- You're mad!
- Don't wait for me.

1134
01:58:46,612 --> 01:58:50,740
- I say we respect his final wish.
- Aye!

1135
01:59:00,126 --> 01:59:02,626
Your bravery is wasted.

1136
01:59:04,004 --> 01:59:10,009
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.

1137
01:59:12,262 --> 01:59:13,679
- Here you go!
- Oof!

1138
01:59:25,774 --> 01:59:27,608
Pirates!

1139
01:59:35,576 --> 01:59:37,035
Hey!

1140
01:59:45,501 --> 01:59:49,087
- What happened to the chest?
- Norrington took it to draw them off.

1141
01:59:49,172 --> 01:59:52,758
- You're pulling too hard!
- You ain't pulling hard enough!

1142
01:59:52,842 --> 01:59:56,303
- Where's the commodore?
- Fell behind.

1143
01:59:56,387 --> 01:59:58,555
My prayers be with him.

1144
01:59:58,598 --> 02:00:00,682
Best not wallow in our grief.

1145
02:00:00,767 --> 02:00:05,604
The bright side is you're back,
and made it off free and clear.

1146
02:00:20,952 --> 02:00:23,287
Lord on high, deliver us.

1147
02:00:26,541 --> 02:00:28,292
I'll handle this, mate.

1148
02:00:30,628 --> 02:00:32,295
Oi, fishface!

1149
02:00:33,756 --> 02:00:36,341
Lose something? Eh?

1150
02:00:41,639 --> 02:00:43,598
Got it!

1151
02:00:44,809 --> 02:00:47,852
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

1152
02:00:47,937 --> 02:00:49,396
Look what I got.

1153
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:52,648
♪ I got a jar of dirt
I got a jar of dirt

1154
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:54,566
♪ And guess what's inside it? ♪

1155
02:00:55,485 --> 02:00:56,985
Enough!

1156
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:07,830
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard!

1157
02:01:07,914 --> 02:01:11,041
Brace up the foreyard!

1158
02:01:14,211 --> 02:01:16,254
Hard to starboard!

1159
02:01:16,338 --> 02:01:19,841
Send his beloved Pearl
back to the depths.

1160
02:01:33,313 --> 02:01:37,190
She's on us! She's on us!

1161
02:01:38,776 --> 02:01:42,863
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, captain.

1162
02:02:08,722 --> 02:02:10,264
Make fast!

1163
02:02:11,516 --> 02:02:14,059
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

1164
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:16,896
Come on, girl!

1165
02:02:22,943 --> 02:02:25,403
- She's falling behind!
- Aye. We've got her!

1166
02:02:25,446 --> 02:02:26,529
We're the faster?

1167
02:02:26,572 --> 02:02:29,199
Against the wind,
the Dutchman beats us.

1168
02:02:29,241 --> 02:02:31,743
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

1169
02:02:31,785 --> 02:02:33,119
Aye.

1170
02:02:35,664 --> 02:02:37,248
We're out of range!

1171
02:02:37,291 --> 02:02:41,919
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

1172
02:02:42,003 --> 02:02:44,421
We're giving up, sir?

1173
02:02:54,474 --> 02:02:56,767
They're giving up!

1174
02:03:02,857 --> 02:03:04,982
My father is on that ship.

1175
02:03:05,067 --> 02:03:07,610
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.

1176
02:03:07,653 --> 02:03:10,279
Why fight when you can negotiate?

1177
02:03:10,364 --> 02:03:15,159
All one needs is the proper leverage.

1178
02:03:15,244 --> 02:03:16,285
Oh!

1179
02:03:24,711 --> 02:03:27,462
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

1180
02:03:28,548 --> 02:03:31,800
We must have hit a reef!

1181
02:03:33,928 --> 02:03:36,471
No. It's not a reef!

1182
02:03:36,556 --> 02:03:37,973
Get away from the rail!

1183
02:03:38,015 --> 02:03:41,101
- What is it?
- The kraken.

1184
02:03:41,477 --> 02:03:43,728
- To arms!
- Load guns! Defend the mast!

1185
02:03:43,813 --> 02:03:45,855
It'll attack the starboard.

1186
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:48,274
Run out the cannons
and hold for my signal!

1187
02:04:21,849 --> 02:04:24,309
Easy, boys!

1188
02:04:27,688 --> 02:04:28,730
Will?

1189
02:04:29,231 --> 02:04:31,441
Steady! Steady.

1190
02:04:33,401 --> 02:04:36,862
- Will!
- Hold. Hold.

1191
02:04:36,946 --> 02:04:39,948
I think we've held fire long enough.

1192
02:04:41,159 --> 02:04:43,535
- Will!
- Fire!

1193
02:04:47,582 --> 02:04:48,957
Oh!

1194
02:05:03,472 --> 02:05:04,472
It'll be back.

1195
02:05:04,556 --> 02:05:07,224
- We have to get off the ship.
- There's no boats.

1196
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:19,986
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

1197
02:05:22,323 --> 02:05:26,785
- Whatever you do, don't miss.
- As soon as you're clear.

1198
02:05:40,965 --> 02:05:45,094
We are short-stocked
on gunpowder! Six barrels!

1199
02:05:46,096 --> 02:05:47,971
Hurry up!

1200
02:05:48,056 --> 02:05:50,099
There's only
half a dozen kegs of powder!

1201
02:05:50,183 --> 02:05:51,934
Then load the rum.

1202
02:06:00,776 --> 02:06:03,611
Aye, the rum too!

1203
02:06:31,806 --> 02:06:33,807
Step to!

1204
02:06:37,103 --> 02:06:40,063
Oh, you coward.

1205
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:45,860
Not good.

1206
02:06:54,536 --> 02:06:57,538
- Haul away!
- Heave!

1207
02:06:57,622 --> 02:07:02,001
- Heave like you're being paid for it!
- Put your backs into it!

1208
02:07:45,043 --> 02:07:48,337
- I got you! I got you!
- Don't let me go!

1209
02:07:48,379 --> 02:07:51,088
- I won't let you go!
- Shoot me!

1210
02:07:56,345 --> 02:07:59,388
- Clear?
- Higher! Higher!

1211
02:08:15,905 --> 02:08:18,406
Here! Come on!

1212
02:08:19,075 --> 02:08:21,701
Come and get me. I'm over here!

1213
02:08:21,744 --> 02:08:23,870
Come on!

1214
02:08:48,812 --> 02:08:51,981
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

1215
02:10:19,357 --> 02:10:21,274
Did we kill it?

1216
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:24,860
No. We just made it angry.

1217
02:10:24,945 --> 02:10:28,322
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

1218
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:32,910
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

1219
02:10:35,205 --> 02:10:38,082
Jack. The Pearl.

1220
02:10:39,334 --> 02:10:41,710
She's only a ship, mate.

1221
02:10:41,753 --> 02:10:44,338
He's right.
We have to head for land.

1222
02:10:44,381 --> 02:10:47,507
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

1223
02:10:47,549 --> 02:10:52,220
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.

1224
02:10:54,098 --> 02:10:55,974
Abandon ship.

1225
02:10:56,058 --> 02:10:58,476
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1226
02:11:15,201 --> 02:11:17,369
Thank you, Jack.

1227
02:11:19,414 --> 02:11:22,207
We're not free yet, love.

1228
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:24,459
You came back.

1229
02:11:27,005 --> 02:11:29,673
I always knew you were a good man.

1230
02:11:42,728 --> 02:11:45,479
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

1231
02:11:45,564 --> 02:11:47,982
Come on, Will. Step to!

1232
02:12:07,126 --> 02:12:09,627
It's after you, not the ship.

1233
02:12:09,670 --> 02:12:12,630
It's not us.

1234
02:12:12,673 --> 02:12:15,466
This is the only way, don't you see?

1235
02:12:18,803 --> 02:12:20,971
I'm not sorry.

1236
02:12:26,478 --> 02:12:28,479
Pirate.

1237
02:12:47,873 --> 02:12:50,041
Where's Jack?

1238
02:12:53,670 --> 02:12:56,255
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

1239
02:13:06,015 --> 02:13:07,015
Go!

1240
02:13:20,904 --> 02:13:24,365
Bugger. Bugger, bugger,
bugger, bugger, bugger!

1241
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:53,726
Come on!

1242
02:13:58,983 --> 02:14:01,734
Just got it. Come on.

1243
02:14:30,804 --> 02:14:32,221
Not so bad.

1244
02:14:34,641 --> 02:14:35,725
Oh.

1245
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:46,360
Hello, beastie.

1246
02:15:35,241 --> 02:15:39,410
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

1247
02:15:40,829 --> 02:15:43,039
The captain goes down with his ship.

1248
02:15:43,123 --> 02:15:47,168
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

1249
02:15:52,424 --> 02:15:53,591
Open the chest.

1250
02:15:56,177 --> 02:15:58,679
Open the chest. I need to see it!

1251
02:16:14,279 --> 02:16:20,283
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

1252
02:16:26,081 --> 02:16:28,874
The last of our ships
has returned.

1253
02:16:28,917 --> 02:16:31,377
Is there any news on the chest?

1254
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:36,048
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

1255
02:16:37,134 --> 02:16:39,342
He had these.

1256
02:16:46,267 --> 02:16:49,436
I took the liberty
of filling in my name.

1257
02:16:56,986 --> 02:17:01,071
If you intend to claim these, then
you must have something to trade.

1258
02:17:01,114 --> 02:17:03,782
Do you have the compass?

1259
02:17:03,867 --> 02:17:05,701
Better.

1260
02:17:12,917 --> 02:17:15,377
The heart of Davy Jones.

1261
02:18:10,847 --> 02:18:13,307
Against the cold...

1262
02:18:13,392 --> 02:18:15,726
...and the sorrow.

1263
02:18:25,987 --> 02:18:28,572
It's a shame.

1264
02:18:28,657 --> 02:18:31,116
I know you're thinking that
with the Pearl

1265
02:18:31,158 --> 02:18:34,911
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1266
02:18:36,664 --> 02:18:39,416
Doesn't matter now.

1267
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:42,085
The Pearl is gone,

1268
02:18:42,169 --> 02:18:44,170
along with its captain.

1269
02:18:44,213 --> 02:18:46,423
Aye.

1270
02:18:46,507 --> 02:18:50,468
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

1271
02:18:50,511 --> 02:18:53,679
He fooled us all right till the end,

1272
02:18:53,721 --> 02:18:57,474
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

1273
02:19:00,353 --> 02:19:02,104
To Jack Sparrow.

1274
02:19:02,188 --> 02:19:04,857
Never another like Captain Jack.

1275
02:19:04,899 --> 02:19:07,192
He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1276
02:19:07,777 --> 02:19:09,862
He was a good man.

1277
02:19:30,549 --> 02:19:34,594
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1278
02:19:36,053 --> 02:19:39,014
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it? Hmm?

1279
02:19:40,975 --> 02:19:44,186
What would you... Hmm?

1280
02:19:46,772 --> 02:19:50,650
What would any of you
be willing to do, hmm?

1281
02:19:51,861 --> 02:19:55,780
Would you sail to the ends
of the Earth and beyond

1282
02:19:55,865 --> 02:20:00,951
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious Pearl?

1283
02:20:07,083 --> 02:20:08,683
Aye.

1284
02:20:13,256 --> 02:20:14,965
Aye.

1285
02:20:17,969 --> 02:20:20,011
Yes.

1286
02:20:22,306 --> 02:20:23,556
Aye.

1287
02:20:23,599 --> 02:20:25,600
All right.

1288
02:20:26,685 --> 02:20:31,648
But if you go and brave
the weird and haunted shores

1289
02:20:31,732 --> 02:20:33,691
at world's end...

1290
02:20:34,818 --> 02:20:38,446
...then you will need a captain

1291
02:20:38,531 --> 02:20:41,114
who knows those waters.

1292
02:20:56,005 --> 02:21:00,175
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?
