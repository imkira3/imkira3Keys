1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,878
Son of a bitch.

3
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:35,131
When I first saw you, I wasn't scared.

4
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:37,717
I was just wondering
why you wore those boots.

5
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:38,926
Now I know.

6
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:50,021
Shit.

7
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:16,464
We've both played this game, Rath.

8
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,383
What kind of shoes
will you be wearing...

9
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,886
when your day comes?

10
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:25,515
Whatever the contract is, I'll double it.

11
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,058
Just say you couldn't find me.

12
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:33,481
Listen to me.

13
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,149
I'm talking like a mark.

14
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:52,708
Oh, God. Don't pull yet. Not yet.

15
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:57,088
Christ. I've killed a few innocents
in my time.

16
00:03:57,922 --> 00:04:01,759
You're so high and mighty.
You and your principles.

17
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:04,971
Someone had to do the jobs
you wouldn't do.

18
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:10,268
I can't die like this.

19
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,520
I'm not a mark.

20
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,355
Not like a mark.

21
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,166
It's chambered.

22
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:43,843
Thanks, Rath.

23
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:52,101
Goodbye, old friend.

24
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:42,772
I don't care what you believe. I've had it.

25
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:44,523
I want out. I quit.

26
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,156
Go away, you son of a bitch.

27
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,168
You should be.

28
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,865
And army of press, police
and the private security.

29
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,074
Today.

30
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:18,492
However, the attention
is not for the man...

31
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,537
being laid to rest, but rather,
for one of the mourners.

32
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:25,541
We're just witnessing the arrival
of recluse billionaire Alan Branch...

33
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,420
here attending the funeral of his brother,
who died in an automobile accident.

34
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:33,757
Alan Branch was last seen testifying
before a Senate hearing 10 years ago.

35
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:37,761
He was questioned for his alleged financing
of right-wing death squads...

36
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:39,847
throughout South and Central America.

37
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,016
- Branch was born in Queens.
- Get over there.

38
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,393
As you can see
from the use of the wheelchair...

39
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,437
he is the victim of a hitman's bullet.

40
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:50,608
It was 10 years ago that Alan Branch was
brought before Senate hearings...

41
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:53,110
where he was questioned about
his involvement...

42
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:57,281
in money laundering, drug-trafficking.
And right-wing death squad financing.

43
00:09:57,448 --> 00:10:00,784
Those hearings went on
for several weeks...

44
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,006
Let us pray.

45
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:57,508
Lord Jesus Christ...

46
00:10:57,675 --> 00:11:00,886
by the three days you lay in the tomb...

47
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:08,560
they, like you, will rise again.

48
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:13,315
Bless this grave, O Lord,
and give Samuel peaceful rest...

49
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:31,208
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

50
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,585
He's been shot.

51
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,261
Come on, you little bastard, be brave.

52
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:25,429
Run for it.

53
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,823
Put it down. Put it down.

54
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,825
- Fuck.
- Put it down.

55
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:48,035
Throw the gun away.

56
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:51,246
On the ground. Face down.

57
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:52,998
- All right.
- Throw the gun away.

58
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:55,542
- All right, all right.
- Throw the gun away.

59
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,961
- Throw it away. Get down.
- Get down, don't move.

60
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,464
- Don't move.
- Don't even...

61
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,550
Hands behind your back.

62
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:04,927
What the hell is he doing?

63
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:06,845
- Hold on. Take it easy.
- Shut up.

64
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:08,639
- Just give me your hands.
- Shut up.

65
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:11,433
- Check him for more weapons.
- Where is it?

66
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,643
- Easy.
- My pocket.

67
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,186
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

68
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:15,479
- There it is.
- Here.

69
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,064
- Silencer, right?
- Get up.

70
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:18,524
- Pistol?
- Okay.

71
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,570
- What do we have here?
- The area's secure. Come on. Let's go.

72
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:29,743
Nice to meet you.

73
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,369
Hey, wait a minute, buddy.
Ambulance, let's go.

74
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,498
Come on. Come on. In there. In there.

75
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,919
Hold it. Number one, move it out.

76
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:23,130
Number two, come on.

77
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,340
Go.

78
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:27,676
All right, get out of there. Go.

79
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:29,803
Go.

80
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:54,119
Three-charlie-four. All
units in the vicinity.

81
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:57,789
A robbery at the liquor store.
Madison and 28th.

82
00:14:57,956 --> 00:15:01,418
One-bravo-five,
what is the disposition of your suspect?

83
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:04,421
This is one-bravo-five.
We're proceeding to the 7th precinct.

84
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:07,758
- We have the suspect in custody, over.
- One-bravo-five, roger.

85
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:10,928
I show you en route
to the precinct with one suspect.

86
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,932
- Look.
- Watch where you're pointing that.

87
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,308
No. Look at this.

88
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:34,826
Look out.

89
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,101
No.

90
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,563
Oh, my God.

91
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:05,440
Hey.

92
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:08,652
Don't fucking try it.

93
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:16,743
This is one-bravo-three,
officers down. Victoria Ave. 2700 block.

94
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:24,751
Repeat, officers down.

95
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:37,639
One-bravo-three, what's your status?

96
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:43,061
One-bravo-three, what's your status?

97
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:49,359
One-bravo-three, please respond.

98
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,716
One-bravo-three, please respond.

99
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:18,722
All units, officers down,
2700 Victoria Avenue.

100
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:21,475
Repeat, officers down.

101
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:44,581
All units, suspect
in the four-officer-down call is at large.

102
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:47,918
Male Hispanic, medium build,
about thirty years. Armed and dangerous.

103
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:50,837
Monitor bus stations, car rental agents
and the airport.

104
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:10,732
- Goddamn it.
- You okay?

105
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:14,111
- Son of a bitch, I just got this car.
- Are you okay? Are you okay?

106
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:16,655
I don't need a problem.
What's it gonna take?

107
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:20,325
I don't have insurance.
Here, take the whole thing. I'm sorry.

108
00:18:20,492 --> 00:18:22,411
I'm sorry about this.

109
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,424
Who's near Denny Way and 5th?

110
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,342
We have a couple going to Crown Hill.

111
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:41,263
Who's near Christina's Restaurant?
We have a man going to the airport.

112
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,307
501, I'm there.

113
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:55,402
Cab 401, pick up three sailors
at Pier 91.

114
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:59,239
Come on. Be the right one.

115
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:12,544
- Taxi. Taxi.
- Sorry, radio call. I'm booked.

116
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:14,004
We saw that first. Hey.

117
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,508
- Airport.
- You got it.

118
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:27,726
You know, you got a cut on your head here.
You see that?

119
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:33,857
- Yeah, I had an accident at work.
- Yeah, what kind of work do you do?

120
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,777
I am, how do you say...

121
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:37,986
dead tired.

122
00:19:38,153 --> 00:19:41,364
So save the chitchat
for someone else, please.

123
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:47,579
Chitchat. I haven't heard that word
for a long time. Chitchat.

124
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,224
- What are you doing?
- What?

125
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,476
- There was the turnoff.
- I'm sorry, okay?

126
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:13,563
- You just blew your tip.
- Think I'm trying to run you up?

127
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,398
- Do your job.
- Don't tell me my job.

128
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,776
- What the fuck?
- I never beat anyone for a fare.

129
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,820
Do your job.

130
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:22,030
All right.

131
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:26,535
Get out.

132
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,869
What?

133
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:31,248
You think I'm running you up, pal?
Then get out.

134
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:36,086
- You can't just...
- The hell I can't.

135
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:39,297
Get out. Go on, find another cab.

136
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:45,262
I don't believe this.

137
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:58,984
Robert...

138
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,861
Rath.

139
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:06,908
You can't shoot me through the glass.

140
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:10,370
Bulletproof. Eh?

141
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:12,247
So I get out...

142
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:15,000
Pow, you got me.

143
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,495
No.

144
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:19,880
So...

145
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:21,798
now what?

146
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:23,550
Who are you, kid?

147
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:27,804
Robert Rath...

148
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:29,472
wants to know me.

149
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:32,976
I don't believe this.

150
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:35,979
Well, eh, Bain.

151
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,315
Miguel Bain.

152
00:21:40,525 --> 00:21:43,570
Let me see. You rolled some cabbie...

153
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:46,865
then waited for the right call.

154
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:48,450
That's genius, man.

155
00:21:49,826 --> 00:21:54,873
Then you got the balls to bullshit with me.
No way I could have done that. No way.

156
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,667
You stole my contract.

157
00:21:58,251 --> 00:21:59,336
How'd you know about it?

158
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,838
A silenced...

159
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:03,214
Ruger .22.

160
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:07,344
Classic.

161
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,348
You know, I switched...

162
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:13,308
when I heard that's what you used.

163
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:18,688
Excuse this.

164
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:20,774
It was a long shot.

165
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:24,277
But a good one. Wasn't it?

166
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:27,030
Who's your contractor, Miguelito?

167
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:30,992
Why don't you drive?

168
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:33,578
We can get acquainted.

169
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,122
Chitchat.

170
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,626
Let's sit.

171
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,628
Okay?

172
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:03,441
Drive.

173
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,695
Number 13 looks tired.

174
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:10,115
Maybe she needs some rest.

175
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:13,201
Drive.

176
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:14,619
Drive.

177
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:16,454
Drive.

178
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,540
Drive.

179
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:22,002
Drive, drive, drive.

180
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:42,188
Protect the innocent. That's weak.

181
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:46,067
You could have had me at the cemetery
but you couldn't shoot the cops.

182
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:49,029
You are antiquado.

183
00:23:56,411 --> 00:24:00,582
I had to try. Who knows?
Maybe it wasn't made in America.

184
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:13,511
They look pissed, huh?

185
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,806
They get that way
when you kill 4 of them.

186
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,019
How do you like the cemetery?

187
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:24,105
Rome, 14 B.C.

188
00:24:24,272 --> 00:24:27,567
They killed a general, Flavius,
at his brother's funeral.

189
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:32,989
But you know, I couldn't wait for Branch's
brother to die, so I killed him too.

190
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:34,824
Proud of me, Bobby?

191
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,329
Well...

192
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:41,581
it was very nice meeting you.

193
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:46,461
Someday, I'll tell my little niños
about this wonderful encounter.

194
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:16,241
Shit.

195
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:47,021
- Oh, fuck.
- Who's your contractor, kid?

196
00:25:54,028 --> 00:25:57,524
You blew it. I am still alive.

197
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:06,624
Not for long.

198
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:19,512
Hey. What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

199
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,390
Watch it, watch it.

200
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:24,434
You'll get us killed.

201
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,979
Let's go get them.

202
00:26:28,146 --> 00:26:30,690
Two-robert-two is in pursuit
of Yellow Cab 501.

203
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:33,193
Robert-two in pursuit. Request backup.

204
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:36,070
Two-robert-three, responding.

205
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:38,823
All units to two-robert-two,
Yellow Cab number 501

206
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,993
was reported stolen in the vicinity
of the officers-down call.

207
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,706
- Ten-four, Regional Air responding.
- Regional Air has joined the pursuit.

208
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,834
Suspects are to be considered
armed and dangerous.

209
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:51,544
Robert-two, received.

210
00:26:55,131 --> 00:27:00,303
Turn it here, turn it here. I know this
neighborhood. Come on. Come on, hit it.

211
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,396
Don't give any more advice, okay?

212
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:13,983
Two-robert-two, this is Regional Air.

213
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,361
We're heading over
to the Michigan Viaduct.

214
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:20,615
Two-robert-two to all units, maintain
positions. We're gonna box him in.

215
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,533
Don't you lose this asshole.

216
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:25,662
This is Regional Air. We copy.

217
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,833
I studied everything you ever did.

218
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,672
Goddamn it, you were good.

219
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:38,716
You and the Russian, Nicolai Talinkov.

220
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:40,093
Tachlinkov.

221
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:46,933
Tachlinkov. Yes.

222
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,731
You know, they say
he's living on some Greek island.

223
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:56,192
But I say, you were the best.

224
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:01,698
I say, Nicolai's dead as a clavo,
a doornail. Am I right, Bob?

225
00:28:02,156 --> 00:28:05,368
I heard you guys played chess coded
in The New York Times obituaries.

226
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:10,164
Ten fucking miles of microfilm.
But I found it. I found it.

227
00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:12,667
The last game ends before anyone wins.

228
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:17,880
He thought you were his friend.

229
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:20,049
And now I know...

230
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:21,467
that's how you took him.

231
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,722
You killed him to be number one.

232
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:41,946
Bishop takes rook pawn.

233
00:28:57,962 --> 00:29:02,675
All units, Regional Air has a visual.
Repeat. Regional Air has a visual.

234
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:04,761
Suspect headed east on Sycamore street.

235
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:31,579
- Regional Air, do you have a visual?
- We got him, got him.

236
00:29:42,632 --> 00:29:43,633
We don't got him.

237
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:12,870
What are you talking about,
bishop takes rook pawn?

238
00:30:26,342 --> 00:30:29,595
Fifteen years
and I still remember this game.

239
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:31,764
It's like yesterday.

240
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:45,153
I hate to admit it,
but you're the world's best.

241
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:50,116
White rook to king one.

242
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,534
Yeah, I remember that one.

243
00:30:57,748 --> 00:31:00,042
- Enter next move.
- Let's see what this kid knows.

244
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:02,420
Enter next move.

245
00:31:02,837 --> 00:31:04,547
Bishop takes...

246
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:06,174
rook pawn.

247
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:13,389
Red bishop takes rook pawn.

248
00:31:18,603 --> 00:31:23,483
Game in check. Game in check.
Game in check.

249
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:28,654
A mark.

250
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:31,532
I'm a goddamn mark.

251
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:45,838
Miguel Bain.

252
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:50,176
Don't play with me now.

253
00:31:56,641 --> 00:31:58,559
You're setting me up.

254
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:01,687
Is this how it went, Nicolai?

255
00:32:02,438 --> 00:32:04,440
Is this how it went?

256
00:32:10,655 --> 00:32:12,406
That's it. I'm gone.

257
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,496
Where are you going?

258
00:32:18,663 --> 00:32:20,081
Where are you going?

259
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,594
Two million and I'm out of here.

260
00:32:34,804 --> 00:32:36,722
I'm gone.

261
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:43,271
Seattle.

262
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:51,404
Surveillance expert.

263
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:54,115
Buyers. Right.

264
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:43,873
The mark. Who's the mark?

265
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:48,669
Goddamn it.

266
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:10,816
<i>How does it feel?</i>

267
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:15,738
<i>How does it feel?</i>

268
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,534
<i>To be on your own</i>

269
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:26,123
Here you go, Pearl.

270
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,250
Here you go.

271
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,252
No, thanks. I won't have any.

272
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:34,173
I'm just gonna have some coffee,
you know? Okay?

273
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:36,592
<i>Come on</i>

274
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:41,222
You know what? I forgot to tell you.

275
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:43,724
We got our pictures back.

276
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,728
Let's see what we have here.

277
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:50,606
This one is good. I like this one of you.

278
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:53,025
It's your good side. See.
Take a look at that.

279
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,403
That nice? That's not so bad, huh?

280
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:57,571
And you say
you don't look good in pictures.

281
00:34:57,947 --> 00:35:01,283
So ridiculous. I do not have time
to talk about this right now.

282
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,244
Never have time to talk about anything.

283
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:04,995
That is not true.

284
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:07,081
I have time, but now is not a good time.

285
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:10,000
I wanted to talk about this
last night and you didn't.

286
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:11,711
I had to get my sleep last night.

287
00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:25,850
Hi, Mrs. Slattery. What you making?

288
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:28,894
Every time we talk about this,
we always end up...

289
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:30,771
- Oh, guys.
- What did you bring it up for?

290
00:35:30,938 --> 00:35:32,648
Guys.

291
00:35:32,815 --> 00:35:33,899
What are you doing?

292
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,151
Don't walk away from me...

293
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:37,820
because you had to bring this up,
we're going to have it out.

294
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:43,409
You're not helping matters here.
You're not...

295
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,910
- Stop it.
- What?

296
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:47,580
If you're so concerned about
what your mother thinks...

297
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:49,373
That is so...

298
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,752
Jeez.

299
00:35:56,797 --> 00:35:58,841
You wanna slam doors? Huh?

300
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:04,054
Fine, I can slam doors.

301
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:07,308
Oh, Jennifer.

302
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:14,857
- Room 115.
- I have the disc.

303
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:18,486
The buyers arrive at noon. Flight 1055.

304
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:23,073
I'll attempt contact at 12:30
and every 15 minutes after that.

305
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:25,701
Do you have the hard copy images?

306
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:28,496
Affirmative. What do I call the principal?

307
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:32,249
- Call him Remy. How will they know?
- They'll know.

308
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,044
Try and trace that one, baby.

309
00:36:43,677 --> 00:36:45,554
Poor baby.

310
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:51,852
Hi. Welcome to the Marriott.
How are you today?

311
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:54,313
- Here's 20 dollars. Keep the car handy.
- Great.

312
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,900
- Anything else I can do for you today?
- No thanks, pal.

313
00:36:58,067 --> 00:37:01,070
Get that for you.
Let me get your ticket for you.

314
00:37:01,237 --> 00:37:03,906
- Can I help you with your bags?
- Nope, I got it.

315
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:08,828
You need your ticket, ma'am.
Here's your ticket. Thank you.

316
00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:19,421
I hated that restaurant.
What a terrible place.

317
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:23,759
I didn't like anything about it.
All those foreigners. What an awful...

318
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,512
What an awful, awful restaurant.

319
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:32,643
Please don't make
another reservation there.

320
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:35,855
You can certainly find a better spot.

321
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:44,029
Fourth floor.

322
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:56,542
You're welcome, baby. My pleasure.

323
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,839
Arriving passenger Remy,
please go to a white courtesy phone.

324
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:05,551
Passenger Remy,
please go to a white courtesy phone.

325
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,388
Excuse me.

326
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:19,982
Hello, this is Remy.

327
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:22,610
Ready to go shopping
on the Horne Information Network?

328
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:24,236
Price is $40,000.

329
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:27,948
- Where are you?
- Are you ready? Yes or no.

330
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:31,327
- Yes.
- The Marriott Hotel, my friend.

331
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:33,621
There are pay phones
across from the elevators.

332
00:38:33,787 --> 00:38:36,916
You've got 20 minutes,
give or take 10 seconds.

333
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:12,660
Cut your hair.

334
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,084
Taxi.

335
00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:21,979
- Hello.
- Ah, good, you're early.

336
00:40:23,105 --> 00:40:24,273
Pick up the Yellow Pages.

337
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,859
- Right.
- Lonely?

338
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:29,236
In town on business?

339
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,613
Why don't you check the escorts?

340
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,877
- Got it.
- It's Room 718. I smell a rat...

341
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:46,837
The disc and I are gone.

342
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,425
- We simpatico?
- Simpatico, yes.

343
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:10,194
Hold the elevator, please.

344
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,613
Damn.

345
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:20,037
- Oh. Excuse me, sir.
- Sorry.

346
00:41:20,204 --> 00:41:23,082
It's okay. Maintenance.

347
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,342
Operator.

348
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:36,970
I'd like to report a problem
with the 12th floor. Electricity's out.

349
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:40,015
Fourth floor.

350
00:41:40,182 --> 00:41:41,683
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.

351
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:52,444
The 12th floor? What room?

352
00:41:53,237 --> 00:41:55,280
I'll go down
and check the circuit breakers.

353
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,993
Seventh floor.

354
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:04,581
Excuse me. Sorry.

355
00:42:23,225 --> 00:42:24,268
All right.

356
00:42:24,434 --> 00:42:27,229
I'd like to make a reservation.

357
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:31,150
Buyers, seller,
let's see who booked multiple rooms.

358
00:42:35,946 --> 00:42:37,614
Come out, wherever you are.

359
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:50,460
718.

360
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:02,639
Hey, fellas, slow down.

361
00:43:04,141 --> 00:43:05,809
Relax.

362
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:09,271
First, I'll need a $10,000 deposit.

363
00:43:09,438 --> 00:43:10,898
That's wasn't the arrangement.

364
00:43:12,482 --> 00:43:14,568
Then we have nothing to discuss.

365
00:43:14,735 --> 00:43:18,739
Wait, wait, wait. Hang on. Okay.

366
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,532
Here's today's menu.

367
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,410
Give me a second, I gotta put in a disc.

368
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:31,084
All right, it's in.

369
00:43:37,007 --> 00:43:38,842
Where do you want the ten thousand?

370
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:52,022
There's a screwdriver on the table.
And then you'll find a conveyance.

371
00:43:54,524 --> 00:43:57,736
Chicago Bulls. Big team. Twenty rooms.

372
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:01,073
No, no, no.

373
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:06,703
Here, Katz. Two rooms, 718, 542.

374
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,456
Paid in cash.
Let's check out the room service.

375
00:44:45,158 --> 00:44:46,368
- Hi.
- Hi.

376
00:44:59,714 --> 00:45:01,925
Twin 9 millimeters.

377
00:45:02,092 --> 00:45:05,345
Room 718, nothing. Room 542...

378
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:10,684
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

379
00:45:12,102 --> 00:45:13,270
Tuna fish.

380
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:19,985
Tuna fish.

381
00:45:21,903 --> 00:45:22,904
Yeah.

382
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,074
Here it comes. Here it comes.

383
00:45:30,412 --> 00:45:32,331
Look out, Pearl.

384
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:36,668
Yes.

385
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:38,211
Pennies from heaven.

386
00:45:38,378 --> 00:45:43,216
Baby. Here, you keep this warm
for me. Okay.

387
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,973
I'm going to format your disc,
orient it to receive the data.

388
00:45:57,606 --> 00:45:59,566
You getting this, Hans Brinker?

389
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,298
Interpol.

390
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,272
Next.

391
00:46:43,944 --> 00:46:45,529
Telephone?

392
00:46:46,446 --> 00:46:48,198
It come from here.

393
00:46:49,366 --> 00:46:51,701
- Beeper?
- This is not my beeper.

394
00:47:01,294 --> 00:47:02,671
No, no, no.

395
00:47:20,897 --> 00:47:22,141
Interpol.

396
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:25,569
What's going on down there?

397
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:29,322
Hello? Can you hear me?

398
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,203
Hey. Hans Brinker, Mr. Dutchman, man,
talk to me. I'm not kidding.

399
00:47:36,163 --> 00:47:39,708
- Hello?
- Please complete the transmission.

400
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,879
Who is this?

401
00:47:47,674 --> 00:47:48,800
Who the hell is this?

402
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:51,720
Please complete the transmission.

403
00:47:51,887 --> 00:47:53,805
Shit.

404
00:47:56,558 --> 00:47:59,686
No. No, no. No, wait.

405
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:06,818
Fuck.

406
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:10,238
Honey...

407
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,240
I'm going to tear your heart out.

408
00:48:13,074 --> 00:48:14,993
Holy Mary.

409
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:25,253
Case. Let's get you your case.

410
00:48:27,422 --> 00:48:32,594
Don't do this to me. We gotta go.
Come on, honey. We gotta go. Shit.

411
00:48:34,554 --> 00:48:37,307
Okay, Pearl, come on. Come on, please.
Please don't do this.

412
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:39,935
Please. Damn it. Okay.

413
00:48:42,395 --> 00:48:44,481
Pearl. Come on. Come on.

414
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:59,079
Don't.

415
00:48:59,955 --> 00:49:01,498
Don't?

416
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,584
Don't what?

417
00:49:09,548 --> 00:49:11,132
Rath.

418
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:15,428
Is that you?

419
00:49:16,137 --> 00:49:17,173
Yeah.

420
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:19,808
The disc.

421
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:22,352
It's you.

422
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,521
- It's you.
- Disc.

423
00:49:25,272 --> 00:49:29,985
You tried the move.
Bishop takes rook pawn.

424
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:32,362
It's a powerful move.

425
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:35,949
Would have been Nicolai's move.
Don't you think?

426
00:49:36,658 --> 00:49:39,995
You got a move for me, Rath? Huh?

427
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:42,872
You know, it's like chess.

428
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:44,249
Is she alive?

429
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:47,419
Did you kill her?

430
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:51,256
Did you kill my mark?

431
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,510
Are you there, sweetie?

432
00:49:58,888 --> 00:50:00,807
Five-forty-two.

433
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:04,352
Is she dead yet, Bobby?

434
00:50:05,353 --> 00:50:10,150
I took care of business on my end.
How about you?

435
00:50:10,317 --> 00:50:11,101
No.

436
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:20,869
A woman.
It's not the same as killing a man.

437
00:50:21,036 --> 00:50:24,581
You have to pull the
trigger a different way.

438
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:29,377
Is she beautiful? Bobby?

439
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:35,467
Pull the trigger. Kill her.

440
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:38,094
Come on. Do it. Do it. Do it.

441
00:50:38,261 --> 00:50:39,512
Come on, pull the trigger.

442
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:45,560
Do it.

443
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:48,938
Pull the trigger. Kill her.
Be professional.

444
00:50:49,105 --> 00:50:50,231
Kill her.

445
00:51:03,912 --> 00:51:05,914
It's my beeper.

446
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,512
Hey!

447
00:51:35,944 --> 00:51:37,278
Come on.

448
00:51:37,445 --> 00:51:39,948
- Where's your car?
- I don't remember where it's parked.

449
00:51:40,115 --> 00:51:42,492
I got your car right here. It's right here.

450
00:51:43,702 --> 00:51:44,744
Thanks.

451
00:51:54,295 --> 00:51:56,631
That's all right. I got it.

452
00:52:18,486 --> 00:52:21,197
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a government employee.

453
00:52:21,698 --> 00:52:22,741
That's bullshit.

454
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:25,160
- Drive and watch your speed.
- Where are we going?

455
00:52:25,326 --> 00:52:26,995
You'll know when we get there.
Watch your speed.

456
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:48,391
- Slow down.
- I can't, I'm too nervous.

457
00:52:48,558 --> 00:52:50,268
Slow down.

458
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:54,689
This other guy, does he work
for the government too?

459
00:52:54,856 --> 00:52:56,983
It's between you and him, right?

460
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,360
Why don't you just leave me out of it?

461
00:53:00,236 --> 00:53:01,905
We can't.

462
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:04,574
You're the mark.

463
00:53:38,274 --> 00:53:39,526
Hey, take it easy, buddy.

464
00:53:39,943 --> 00:53:41,069
Oh. Jeez. Excuse me.

465
00:53:41,236 --> 00:53:45,365
- Hey. Hey. My cat. My cat.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

466
00:53:45,532 --> 00:53:47,450
No, no, no.

467
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:10,974
Damn.

468
00:54:13,852 --> 00:54:15,103
Oh, yes.

469
00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:40,587
- Thank you, Heather.
- Thanks.

470
00:54:40,753 --> 00:54:42,046
- Hello.
- Hi.

471
00:54:44,716 --> 00:54:50,430
Pearl, come out, don't be afraid.
What are you here? How are you, sweetie?

472
00:54:50,597 --> 00:54:54,475
- Where's her mama?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.

473
00:55:05,653 --> 00:55:07,864
Thank you, pussycat.

474
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:12,118
Cold.

475
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:16,831
Cold.

476
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:23,254
Hot.

477
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:28,134
So that's where you live.

478
00:55:39,395 --> 00:55:40,813
Jen?

479
00:55:41,356 --> 00:55:43,942
- I really love you.
- I love you too.

480
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:50,281
<i>Nobody loves me</i>

481
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:51,824
<i>It's true</i>

482
00:55:53,868 --> 00:55:56,496
<i>Not like you do</i>

483
00:55:57,872 --> 00:55:59,332
Baby.

484
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:03,544
Oh, Pearl.

485
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:11,886
- Where is he?
- You sick little bitch.

486
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:13,096
Downstairs.

487
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:18,226
Do you wanna live?

488
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:20,269
<i>Oh, these sour times</i>

489
00:56:22,563 --> 00:56:25,775
<i>Nobody loves me</i>

490
00:56:25,942 --> 00:56:27,485
<i>It's true</i>

491
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:32,407
<i>Not like you do</i>

492
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,085
<i>After time the bitter taste</i>

493
00:56:44,252 --> 00:56:46,963
<i>Of innocence, descent or race</i>

494
00:56:48,214 --> 00:56:50,341
Give me the keys to your apartment.

495
00:56:53,011 --> 00:56:54,929
Meet me at the pet shop.

496
00:57:18,786 --> 00:57:20,830
<i>After time the bitter taste</i>

497
00:57:20,997 --> 00:57:23,624
<i>Of innocence, descent or race</i>

498
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:26,002
<i>Scattered seed, buried lives</i>

499
00:57:26,169 --> 00:57:27,420
<i>Mysteries of...</i>

500
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:33,342
<i>Circumstance will decide</i>

501
00:57:38,473 --> 00:57:40,475
<i>It's true</i>

502
00:57:45,646 --> 00:57:47,857
Blank. Shit.

503
00:57:51,027 --> 00:57:52,070
Blank.

504
00:57:53,988 --> 00:57:56,032
- Hi.
- Jennifer.

505
00:57:57,408 --> 00:57:59,494
Jennifer, wait. Goddamn it.

506
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,790
Hey, pal. Come on. Move it.

507
00:58:30,483 --> 00:58:33,569
<i>Nobody loves me</i>

508
00:58:33,736 --> 00:58:35,279
<i>It's true</i>

509
00:58:37,115 --> 00:58:39,700
<i>Not like you do</i>

510
00:58:40,368 --> 00:58:42,036
<i>Nobody loves me</i>

511
00:58:42,203 --> 00:58:43,204
Bob?

512
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,254
I'm sorry.

513
00:59:04,725 --> 00:59:05,768
Jasmine.

514
00:59:33,588 --> 00:59:35,047
Fuck.

515
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:38,050
Your gun is slow.

516
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:44,682
- I'm not the one shooting at mirrors, son.
- Just who the hell do you think...?

517
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:47,101
Surprise. The disc.

518
00:59:48,436 --> 00:59:50,354
The disc.

519
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:52,273
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

520
01:00:03,576 --> 01:00:05,620
- I told you to wait. Shut up.
- Just...

521
01:00:14,128 --> 01:00:16,422
- Disc.
- Get out.

522
01:00:23,221 --> 01:00:27,266
I beat you to the buyers.
Now, I beat you to the mark.

523
01:00:28,643 --> 01:00:29,977
I'm sorry...

524
01:00:30,144 --> 01:00:33,397
but I think I picked the wrong guy
to be my hero. Yep.

525
01:00:36,817 --> 01:00:39,028
Macho, macho, ooh-hoo.

526
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:42,740
You know...

527
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:44,158
today's my birthday.

528
01:00:45,576 --> 01:00:48,537
Today I become number one.

529
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:52,541
And I got a present...

530
01:01:05,388 --> 01:01:06,639
Fuck.

531
01:01:06,806 --> 01:01:09,100
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

532
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,211
Happy birthday, asshole.

533
01:01:40,256 --> 01:01:41,799
Shit!

534
01:02:31,265 --> 01:02:33,601
Goddamn it, I'm old.

535
01:02:38,064 --> 01:02:41,484
No. The girl from downstairs,
I saw her coming back to the building.

536
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,943
She's not in her apartment.

537
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:46,781
She could be here somewhere
in the building. I gotta find her before...

538
01:02:48,616 --> 01:02:50,284
She's dead.

539
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:29,156
- Come here, Pearl. Come here.
- Hey.

540
01:03:29,323 --> 01:03:31,700
- Get back here. Come here, come here.
- Hello, Pearl.

541
01:03:31,867 --> 01:03:34,745
- Pearl, get back here. Come here, girl.
- She likes me.

542
01:03:35,496 --> 01:03:36,956
She likes dead fish too.

543
01:03:39,834 --> 01:03:41,001
What do you call yourself?

544
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:43,671
Robert Rath.

545
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:46,799
Right.

546
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,510
You can call me Electra.

547
01:03:52,555 --> 01:03:54,390
Are you one of them?

548
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:58,936
Was.

549
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,814
Retired.

550
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,358
Pardon me if I choose not to believe you.

551
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:11,031
Electra, I'm telling you,
if I wanted to kill you...

552
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:12,616
I would have done it.

553
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:25,045
- Look what mommy did.
- What the matter, it's not loaded?

554
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,259
Oh, yeah, it's loaded. It's silenced.

555
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:34,513
All you have to do is shoot.

556
01:04:35,389 --> 01:04:36,807
I could.

557
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:39,477
I'd be 500 miles away
before anybody found you.

558
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:50,988
Quit it, she doesn't like it.

559
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:56,577
Pearl, I say she's afraid
she might hit you. Here.

560
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:04,084
You sorry I have the gun?
You think it was a mistake?

561
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:06,253
You think I'm scared?

562
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:10,174
- You don't know shit about me.
- You're wrong.

563
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:11,967
Shut up.

564
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:16,388
Today was supposed to be
a really good day.

565
01:05:16,555 --> 01:05:21,769
Payday. Forty grand.
I was gonna buy Pearl a boyfriend.

566
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:25,064
Now two people are dead.

567
01:05:27,441 --> 01:05:29,276
I'm in way over my head, mister.

568
01:05:30,528 --> 01:05:31,820
I just want out.

569
01:05:33,113 --> 01:05:35,741
You got the gun.
The key's on the dresser.

570
01:05:35,908 --> 01:05:37,409
Go.

571
01:05:38,452 --> 01:05:41,789
Look, I don't have a social security
number, a driver's license.

572
01:05:41,956 --> 01:05:44,917
I can barely remember my real name.

573
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:47,253
I'm a ghost. I'm nobody.

574
01:05:47,419 --> 01:05:48,546
I'll just disappear.

575
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,508
I found you. So did he. You can't hide.

576
01:05:53,968 --> 01:05:56,512
I just want my life back.

577
01:05:57,304 --> 01:05:59,390
That's all I want.

578
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,773
I'm sorry.

579
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:24,707
I'll take that.

580
01:06:30,004 --> 01:06:32,006
I need to be alone.

581
01:06:33,257 --> 01:06:36,885
I haven't spent this much time
with somebody in years.

582
01:06:49,023 --> 01:06:50,274
Neither have I.

583
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:26,894
Well, the disc...

584
01:07:45,454 --> 01:07:46,497
You'll get it.

585
01:08:09,937 --> 01:08:10,979
Fuck you.

586
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:22,157
I don't care what you are.

587
01:08:27,996 --> 01:08:30,791
Fuck you.

588
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:50,018
Then who the hell's Miguel Bain?

589
01:09:08,912 --> 01:09:11,248
Who the hell is Miguel Bain?

590
01:09:11,582 --> 01:09:13,751
Christ.

591
01:09:26,305 --> 01:09:28,056
From Japanese store shelves.

592
01:09:28,223 --> 01:09:31,185
Welland's apples have only been allowed
in Japan since December.

593
01:09:31,351 --> 01:09:34,188
- Hello, Pearl.
- A random test revealed trace amounts...

594
01:09:34,354 --> 01:09:36,607
What'd they say about the shooting
at the Marriott?

595
01:09:36,774 --> 01:09:38,025
Nothing.

596
01:09:38,192 --> 01:09:40,360
Well, no, I don't need details,
just in general.

597
01:09:40,527 --> 01:09:42,196
- Nothing.
- That's impossible.

598
01:09:42,362 --> 01:09:43,614
Not really. Not if...

599
01:09:44,198 --> 01:09:46,033
Not if what?

600
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:48,202
The CIA or Interpol...

601
01:09:51,747 --> 01:09:52,790
What's on this?

602
01:09:53,373 --> 01:09:55,751
Um... It's encrypted.

603
01:09:55,918 --> 01:10:00,214
Breaking the code on my laptop
could take 200 or 300 years.

604
01:10:00,589 --> 01:10:03,133
- I thought you said you a genius?
- I am.

605
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:06,094
I was the best. If it was stored
electronically, it was mine.

606
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:07,846
Was?

607
01:10:08,889 --> 01:10:11,225
Yeah, I'm retiring too.

608
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,269
I wish I had an insight...

609
01:10:14,436 --> 01:10:17,689
but it was all anonymous,
an intercepted satellite transmission.

610
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,485
Probably just industrial secrets.

611
01:10:25,197 --> 01:10:28,909
There's just one bed.
I guess you picked up on that.

612
01:10:29,076 --> 01:10:30,744
- It's all yours.
- You want the couch?

613
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,371
No, thanks.

614
01:10:38,627 --> 01:10:42,089
What's that, like, a trick of the trade?
So you don't get too comfortable?

615
01:10:43,757 --> 01:10:46,760
Why don't you just tie a string
from your toe to the doorknob.

616
01:10:46,927 --> 01:10:48,637
It opens in.

617
01:10:53,809 --> 01:10:58,105
- If it opens in, you wouldn't feel it.
- No. Yeah, I got it. I understand.

618
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:01,859
Pearl.

619
01:11:49,823 --> 01:11:51,325
Thanks.

620
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,744
For what?

621
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:55,704
I don't know.

622
01:11:56,288 --> 01:11:58,624
Saving my life, I guess.

623
01:12:04,546 --> 01:12:07,007
How'd you like to make a million dollars?

624
01:12:07,299 --> 01:12:09,384
What do I have to do?

625
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,513
Nothing cheap, I hope.

626
01:12:15,515 --> 01:12:18,226
- Well, tell me, what is it?
- I'll tell you tomorrow.

627
01:12:18,393 --> 01:12:20,687
- Great, now I can't sleep.
- Be patient.

628
01:12:20,854 --> 01:12:22,856
What? Tell me.

629
01:12:23,815 --> 01:12:25,943
Thanks for the chocolate.

630
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,363
Good night.

631
01:12:51,426 --> 01:12:53,261
Forget something?

632
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:03,522
You be careful, partner.

633
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,355
<i>Get to see you every day</i>

634
01:14:50,837 --> 01:14:53,632
<i>I live my life like I've been around</i>

635
01:15:04,142 --> 01:15:05,310
<i>To buy my...</i>

636
01:15:10,398 --> 01:15:12,025
<i>I'm right here, my friend.</i>

637
01:15:23,453 --> 01:15:26,039
<i>'Cause I want to experience</i>

638
01:15:26,373 --> 01:15:28,083
A hundred million more

639
01:15:37,759 --> 01:15:39,386
Hey.

640
01:15:43,056 --> 01:15:44,599
Damn.

641
01:15:44,766 --> 01:15:46,101
What's going on back there?

642
01:15:46,268 --> 01:15:47,686
Fine, I'll move.

643
01:16:14,504 --> 01:16:17,883
<i>There's no one who can have my reality</i>

644
01:16:18,049 --> 01:16:21,928
- I hate that music.
- Come on, let's go.

645
01:16:24,973 --> 01:16:26,558
Got it? Is it all there?

646
01:16:29,394 --> 01:16:31,188
- What're you doing?
- Shit. Drive.

647
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:33,690
- What?
- Drive, fast.

648
01:16:34,649 --> 01:16:35,942
I mean, fast.

649
01:16:39,321 --> 01:16:40,655
Get off this street. Turn.

650
01:16:45,785 --> 01:16:46,912
Stop.

651
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:52,542
Hit it. Go.

652
01:17:10,518 --> 01:17:12,979
No money, no disk.

653
01:17:15,315 --> 01:17:17,817
Hey. What's so funny?

654
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:21,738
Well, I wasn't sure you'd be coming back
so I switched the disks.

655
01:17:21,905 --> 01:17:24,032
And all they got was a list of file names.

656
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:26,576
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

657
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:29,955
And they got bubkes. Zero, zilch...

658
01:17:30,121 --> 01:17:32,999
zot, nix, nada, dry hump, squirt...

659
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:34,209
diddley-squat.

660
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:37,796
I read a slang dictionary once.

661
01:17:42,133 --> 01:17:44,552
Now you just keep reading.

662
01:17:47,138 --> 01:17:49,599
Contractor tried to kill you, buddy.

663
01:17:49,766 --> 01:17:52,185
And that's not good.

664
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:00,819
Here, Pearl.

665
01:18:01,861 --> 01:18:05,865
Hey, Pearl, I got some caviar
for you, baby. Come here.

666
01:18:06,658 --> 01:18:08,410
Good girl.

667
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:11,997
Hey, did you know that "caviar"
isn't a Russian word.

668
01:18:12,747 --> 01:18:15,208
I think the word is "ikra".

669
01:18:17,043 --> 01:18:19,713
- How did you know that?
- I had a Russian friend, Nikolai.

670
01:18:19,879 --> 01:18:21,715
He told me about it.

671
01:18:22,424 --> 01:18:25,885
- Had a friend?
- Yeah.

672
01:18:26,428 --> 01:18:29,347
About 15 years ago, he was taken.

673
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:33,893
That means he was killed, right?

674
01:18:45,363 --> 01:18:47,657
Yes, I'm still alive, you son of a bitch.

675
01:18:59,544 --> 01:19:00,670
Not this time.

676
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,382
Let's see how valuable
he really thinks this is.

677
01:19:07,052 --> 01:19:08,845
Three million?

678
01:19:09,012 --> 01:19:10,472
Four?

679
01:19:12,182 --> 01:19:13,808
More.

680
01:19:21,232 --> 01:19:22,901
Twenty fucking million dollars?

681
01:19:24,402 --> 01:19:25,445
Jesus.

682
01:19:30,325 --> 01:19:32,994
Where do you suppose
this person is right now?

683
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:37,582
A mile from here?
Thousand miles from here?

684
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:41,294
Never really thought about it till now.

685
01:19:42,003 --> 01:19:45,423
You quit your job, you're having thoughts
you never had before.

686
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:47,759
Sounds like a mid-life crisis.

687
01:19:52,597 --> 01:19:54,265
You're right.

688
01:20:13,868 --> 01:20:15,453
Oh, man.

689
01:20:16,538 --> 01:20:18,957
Twenty million dollars.
Twenty million dollars.

690
01:20:27,757 --> 01:20:29,551
We're partners, right?

691
01:20:40,186 --> 01:20:41,563
That's $10 million apiece.

692
01:20:41,729 --> 01:20:44,816
- It's 8 million. Bank keeps 20 percent.
- I thought I was a thief.

693
01:20:47,193 --> 01:20:50,280
- Do you have a passport?
- I have 12. Where we going?

694
01:20:50,447 --> 01:20:52,365
- Going to the bank.
- All right.

695
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:13,279
What happened to the hotel?

696
01:22:13,446 --> 01:22:16,616
They had a fire years ago.
And nobody had money to fix it.

697
01:22:18,493 --> 01:22:20,995
- Wait here.
- Okay.

698
01:22:22,664 --> 01:22:25,124
Keep the air on and watch my cat, okay?

699
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:26,584
You got it.

700
01:22:32,924 --> 01:22:36,553
Hey, is that our bank?
That where our money is?

701
01:22:41,015 --> 01:22:44,018
- What's up there?
- He'll be.

702
01:23:29,022 --> 01:23:30,982
It's all right. Hug the wall.

703
01:23:31,149 --> 01:23:32,692
- Hug the wall.
- Careful.

704
01:23:32,859 --> 01:23:35,028
Go light, go light, go light.

705
01:23:39,657 --> 01:23:41,367
Jesus.

706
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:46,307
Hey. You okay?

707
01:24:52,522 --> 01:24:55,900
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning,
I'm going go into that bank.

708
01:24:56,067 --> 01:24:59,779
He's gonna be down there in the plaza
somewhere, somewhere in the crowd.

709
01:24:59,946 --> 01:25:03,324
When he sees me go in,
he's gonna make his move up here.

710
01:25:03,574 --> 01:25:07,662
You're gonna be in the cafe over there.
You'll see him when he goes inside.

711
01:25:08,621 --> 01:25:09,956
Then we wait.

712
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:13,501
And we wait.

713
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,796
Tomorrow's gonna be a long day for him.

714
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:21,050
He's gonna begin to doubt himself.
He's gonna think he missed me.

715
01:25:21,384 --> 01:25:25,346
He's gonna want to see with his own eyes
whether I'm still in the bank.

716
01:25:26,305 --> 01:25:28,349
Then it'll be sunset.

717
01:25:28,808 --> 01:25:30,643
Closing time.

718
01:25:32,478 --> 01:25:33,938
He's gonna get desperate...

719
01:25:34,105 --> 01:25:35,898
real desperate.

720
01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:39,485
But he must leave his rifle behind.

721
01:25:39,652 --> 01:25:43,322
On this side. He's right-handed.

722
01:25:43,489 --> 01:25:46,743
He won't take a pistol because
there's metal detectors on the doors...

723
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:49,036
and he's gonna be very nervous.

724
01:25:52,707 --> 01:25:56,169
When he's out of sight,
you come up here and take the rifle.

725
01:25:56,335 --> 01:25:59,464
He'll shoot you
before you go into the bank.

726
01:26:01,048 --> 01:26:03,968
No. He'll wait for the prime shot.

727
01:26:07,221 --> 01:26:08,306
When I come out.

728
01:26:11,392 --> 01:26:12,769
He'll wanna see my eyes.

729
01:26:20,818 --> 01:26:22,153
Why are you so sure?

730
01:26:25,907 --> 01:26:27,992
He loves history.

731
01:26:29,076 --> 01:26:31,370
Fifteen years ago...

732
01:26:31,788 --> 01:26:34,040
in this same room...

733
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,585
in this same window...

734
01:26:38,628 --> 01:26:39,670
I was here.

735
01:26:45,092 --> 01:26:47,011
Oh, my God.

736
01:26:48,721 --> 01:26:51,307
Your friend, Nicolai.
You said he was taken.

737
01:26:55,603 --> 01:26:56,896
You killed him.

738
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,847
It's fine.

739
01:28:42,001 --> 01:28:44,837
- Who is it?
- Room service.

740
01:28:45,963 --> 01:28:48,299
I didn't order any room service.

741
01:28:48,549 --> 01:28:50,301
I did.

742
01:28:52,345 --> 01:28:54,639
You should tell me these things.

743
01:29:01,228 --> 01:29:02,271
Hi.

744
01:29:02,521 --> 01:29:04,690
Where would you like me to put the tray?

745
01:29:04,857 --> 01:29:07,360
Oh. Over here's fine.

746
01:29:09,362 --> 01:29:11,113
Here we go.

747
01:29:12,865 --> 01:29:15,660
So, what's going on outside?

748
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:19,038
The Day of the Dead.

749
01:29:19,205 --> 01:29:20,456
What are the flowers for?

750
01:29:20,623 --> 01:29:25,127
The families, they make a path
from their homes to the cemetery...

751
01:29:25,294 --> 01:29:31,092
with the flower petals so the souls of the
dead loved ones can find their way home.

752
01:29:31,258 --> 01:29:34,220
- That's nice.
- Please, call me anytime for the tray.

753
01:29:34,387 --> 01:29:36,555
Okay, gracias.

754
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:46,983
Sounds great, huh? Can we go?

755
01:29:47,692 --> 01:29:50,486
No, he's here now.
I know he is. He's here.

756
01:29:50,653 --> 01:29:52,571
So you and me,
we're staying in the hotel.

757
01:29:53,197 --> 01:29:55,783
The enemy of fun.

758
01:29:56,117 --> 01:29:57,368
I bought you a beer.

759
01:30:05,209 --> 01:30:07,294
Hey, Pearl. Come here.

760
01:30:35,114 --> 01:30:36,615
Electra.

761
01:30:48,461 --> 01:30:50,671
I wish I could explain to you why...

762
01:30:50,838 --> 01:30:52,965
I killed Nicolai.

763
01:30:53,466 --> 01:30:56,761
I guess at the time,
it was the right thing to do, but...

764
01:30:57,053 --> 01:30:58,721
I'm sorry I did it.

765
01:30:58,888 --> 01:31:02,141
But it's something I've had to live with
for 15 years.

766
01:31:03,642 --> 01:31:06,312
I used to wish the same thing
would happen to me...

767
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:08,564
and that would have been my way out.

768
01:31:09,815 --> 01:31:11,525
Permanently.

769
01:31:12,485 --> 01:31:14,320
But not anymore.

770
01:31:17,323 --> 01:31:19,492
Not since I met you.

771
01:31:21,869 --> 01:31:23,454
Electra?

772
01:32:12,795 --> 01:32:14,547
Cerveza. Cerveza.

773
01:32:17,299 --> 01:32:19,385
It's a shame
you don't understand English.

774
01:32:19,552 --> 01:32:23,556
You know, I would like to tell you how
wonderful this cemetery is. It's gorgeous.

775
01:32:23,722 --> 01:32:27,643
I love cemeteries. I really do.
I really do.

776
01:32:27,810 --> 01:32:30,229
One day, you're here,
the next day you're down there.

777
01:32:30,396 --> 01:32:33,232
You know, I put a lot of people
down there.

778
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:36,735
Oh yeah, a lot of people down there.
Yeah, I did.

779
01:32:36,902 --> 01:32:38,112
Right.

780
01:33:22,573 --> 01:33:24,533
Jasmine.

781
01:34:41,318 --> 01:34:43,112
Jasmine.

782
01:34:44,738 --> 01:34:47,032
It's all over the place.

783
01:34:49,702 --> 01:34:51,704
Excuse me. Excuse me.

784
01:35:14,226 --> 01:35:16,562
I just killed your brother.

785
01:35:28,198 --> 01:35:29,950
Come here, Pearl.

786
01:35:31,952 --> 01:35:34,204
Contract has been paid.

787
01:35:34,371 --> 01:35:38,334
Transferred to the specified account.

788
01:35:38,834 --> 01:35:41,545
And her disc?

789
01:35:44,506 --> 01:35:48,093
You'll be advised. Goodbye, Robert.

790
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,928
Goodbye.

791
01:35:51,013 --> 01:35:53,515
- Let's get ready.
- Okay.

792
01:35:56,602 --> 01:35:59,313
- Don't lose this.
- What's that? A two-way?

793
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:02,524
Oh, man. This is a piece of junk.
Why didn't you let me know?

794
01:36:02,691 --> 01:36:05,611
Listen. You tell me
when he leaves the hotel.

795
01:36:05,778 --> 01:36:08,030
I'll tell you when he leaves the bank.
We're out.

796
01:36:08,197 --> 01:36:09,740
- What's this for?
- Just in case.

797
01:36:10,366 --> 01:36:15,579
- No. I can't shoot anybody. I can't do that.
- You almost shot me.

798
01:36:16,205 --> 01:36:19,124
- I was aiming at the lamp.
- Well, you can aim at him.

799
01:36:23,128 --> 01:36:24,463
Remember when you were a kid?

800
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:27,132
- Ever play cowboys and Indians?
- Sure. Everybody did.

801
01:36:27,299 --> 01:36:30,636
- And which were you?
- An Indian.

802
01:36:31,637 --> 01:36:34,515
- I was always an Indian.
- Always the Indian.

803
01:36:34,681 --> 01:36:38,143
Well, you just pretend he's a cowboy,
and pull the trigger.

804
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:42,272
Then pretend he gets up after that.
But you got to pull the trigger.

805
01:36:43,232 --> 01:36:44,733
You got to.

806
01:36:47,027 --> 01:36:50,155
I never depended on anyone in my life.

807
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:52,408
But I'm depending on you.

808
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:24,106
I don't see him.

809
01:37:24,273 --> 01:37:27,234
I'm looking all the way
around the square.

810
01:37:30,863 --> 01:37:32,656
I'm in the bank.

811
01:37:39,955 --> 01:37:41,248
Where do I go for transfers?

812
01:37:41,915 --> 01:37:42,958
Oh, my God.

813
01:37:44,376 --> 01:37:45,919
He's here.

814
01:37:46,211 --> 01:37:47,754
He's heading towards the hotel.

815
01:37:50,132 --> 01:37:51,633
He's almost at the door.

816
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,596
Yeah, okay. He's almost in. He's...
Yeah. Yeah.

817
01:37:55,762 --> 01:37:57,973
He's going in. He's going in.
He's going in.

818
01:37:58,807 --> 01:38:01,643
That's what we want, Electra.
Relax, try the decaf.

819
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:03,729
He must be upstairs.
So, what do you want?

820
01:38:03,896 --> 01:38:05,981
Should I stay here?
Do you want me to go now?

821
01:38:06,148 --> 01:38:09,651
Should I stay? Wait, wait. I'll just wait.

822
01:38:09,818 --> 01:38:11,862
It's hot out here. Goddamn, it's hot.

823
01:38:12,029 --> 01:38:15,866
Believe me, I'd rather be out there
than in here.

824
01:38:17,659 --> 01:38:19,036
- May I help you, sir?
- Hi.

825
01:38:19,203 --> 01:38:21,830
I'm expecting a transfer.
Here's the number.

826
01:38:50,776 --> 01:38:55,197
- Señor, we have received your transfer.
- I'd like to close the account.

827
01:38:55,364 --> 01:38:58,033
- Would you get the paperwork ready?
- Today?

828
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,286
- You wish to close your account today?
- Right now. Today.

829
01:39:01,453 --> 01:39:04,540
- How would you like the funds?
- American currency.

830
01:39:05,123 --> 01:39:08,126
Would you please step right over there.
I'll be right back.

831
01:39:08,293 --> 01:39:09,336
No problem.

832
01:39:46,582 --> 01:39:48,584
Mr. Rath?

833
01:39:49,918 --> 01:39:52,588
You're aware, señor,
there may be a withdrawal fee.

834
01:39:52,754 --> 01:39:54,339
Yes, I am.

835
01:39:55,257 --> 01:39:57,426
This will take some time.

836
01:39:58,093 --> 01:40:00,012
I've got all day.

837
01:40:00,178 --> 01:40:01,346
Please, take care of him.

838
01:40:01,513 --> 01:40:04,349
Please, follow me. Right this way, sir.

839
01:40:06,184 --> 01:40:08,604
You may sit right over here.

840
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:11,565
Just relax. We'll get you some coffee.

841
01:40:40,093 --> 01:40:41,845
What are you doing in there?

842
01:41:00,197 --> 01:41:02,032
Fuck.

843
01:41:02,866 --> 01:41:04,576
Fuck.

844
01:41:42,072 --> 01:41:43,365
Talk to me.

845
01:41:43,532 --> 01:41:46,368
Well, no sign of him.
He's just sitting up there, same as us.

846
01:41:47,202 --> 01:41:50,872
No, I mean, talk to me.
Tell me some of that weird stuff you know.

847
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,333
Tell you weird stuff, huh?

848
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,961
- Like what?
- Tell me a joke.

849
01:41:56,128 --> 01:41:57,671
Oh, well...

850
01:41:57,838 --> 01:42:00,298
- May I?
- Oh, sure.

851
01:42:01,341 --> 01:42:03,468
Tell me something
to keep my mind off of this.

852
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:06,179
All right.

853
01:42:06,346 --> 01:42:10,058
- I'm not getting paid for this, but here goes.
- Come on, be generous.

854
01:42:10,225 --> 01:42:12,477
All right, once upon a time...

855
01:42:13,186 --> 01:42:15,063
there was a little sparrow...

856
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:17,858
who, while flying south
for the winter, froze solid...

857
01:42:18,024 --> 01:42:20,026
and fell to the ground.

858
01:42:20,444 --> 01:42:22,779
Then, to make matters worse,
a cow crapped on him.

859
01:42:22,946 --> 01:42:25,782
But the manure was all warm
and it defrosted him.

860
01:42:25,949 --> 01:42:30,954
So there he is, warm and
happy to be alive and he starts to sing.

861
01:42:31,121 --> 01:42:32,748
A cat comes along...

862
01:42:32,914 --> 01:42:36,710
and he clears off the manure and looks
at the little bird, and then he eats him.

863
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:39,171
The moral of the story is this.

864
01:42:39,337 --> 01:42:43,049
Everyone who craps on you
is not necessarily your enemy...

865
01:42:43,216 --> 01:42:45,594
and everyone
who gets you out of crap...

866
01:42:46,219 --> 01:42:48,346
is not necessarily your friend.

867
01:42:48,513 --> 01:42:50,974
And if you're warm and happy...

868
01:42:51,141 --> 01:42:54,019
no matter where you are,
just keep your big mouth shut.

869
01:42:58,190 --> 01:42:59,649
You like that, huh?

870
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:19,211
But, Rath, listen.
I think I'm running out of stories here.

871
01:43:19,377 --> 01:43:21,671
Seriously, keep your eye on that building.

872
01:43:21,838 --> 01:43:23,799
I know he's gotta be getting impatient.

873
01:43:23,965 --> 01:43:26,843
He has to make his move very soon.
And Electra...

874
01:43:28,094 --> 01:43:29,638
thanks for the stories.

875
01:43:56,456 --> 01:44:01,378
- Sorry I've been taking up the table. Here.
- Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

876
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:17,102
Fuck! Shit! Motherfucker!

877
01:44:17,269 --> 01:44:19,437
Fuck! Shit!

878
01:44:31,157 --> 01:44:34,369
We have deducted our fee
and are making a second count.

879
01:44:34,536 --> 01:44:36,746
The funds will be available
in one half hour.

880
01:44:37,289 --> 01:44:39,583
I hope you are comfortable.

881
01:45:06,818 --> 01:45:09,237
No, no, no.

882
01:46:24,312 --> 01:46:27,023
Oh, my God. He's coming.
He's coming out of the hotel.

883
01:46:27,190 --> 01:46:31,194
- He waited four minutes longer than I did.
- There he is. He's coming.

884
01:46:31,903 --> 01:46:34,197
- Go.
- Go. Okay.

885
01:46:37,909 --> 01:46:40,286
- I have your property.
- Be right there.

886
01:46:44,666 --> 01:46:47,419
- Where are you?
- I'm here, I'm in room 303.

887
01:46:50,255 --> 01:46:51,798
The rifle should be on the right.

888
01:46:51,965 --> 01:46:55,593
And if so,
the gun is going to be right here.

889
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,887
- It's not here.
- I'm not sure what's happening.

890
01:47:00,682 --> 01:47:03,810
- It's not here.
- Listen to me.

891
01:47:03,977 --> 01:47:05,020
Get out now.

892
01:47:09,774 --> 01:47:13,236
- Damn it.
- Listen to me, forget the rifle. Get out.

893
01:47:24,622 --> 01:47:26,916
Electra, have you left?

894
01:47:29,419 --> 01:47:33,465
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Found it. I see it.

895
01:48:19,177 --> 01:48:22,972
- It's a damn hot day, isn't it?
- Scorcher.

896
01:48:27,018 --> 01:48:30,230
I got it. Got it.

897
01:48:35,527 --> 01:48:37,403
Tell me something.

898
01:48:39,114 --> 01:48:41,449
How did you know?

899
01:48:42,075 --> 01:48:43,660
I mean, who the hell taught you?

900
01:48:44,619 --> 01:48:46,871
History. Nicolai.

901
01:48:48,623 --> 01:48:51,876
Fifteen years ago I walked into this bank
just like you are now.

902
01:48:52,043 --> 01:48:53,962
That makes you good...

903
01:48:54,129 --> 01:48:56,047
because I was the best.

904
01:48:57,132 --> 01:49:01,219
But now you feel like a mark, don't you?
You think you were sold out.

905
01:49:01,719 --> 01:49:03,721
Don't know who to trust.

906
01:49:04,472 --> 01:49:06,057
And you, antiquado?

907
01:49:07,392 --> 01:49:12,105
Who can you trust? No one.
You are alone. Same as me.

908
01:49:18,653 --> 01:49:19,988
I don't have it.

909
01:49:21,614 --> 01:49:22,740
I don't have the gun...

910
01:49:28,329 --> 01:49:31,916
Why the sunglasses, kid?
Afraid to let me see your eyes?

911
01:49:34,419 --> 01:49:36,588
Well, just between you and me...

912
01:49:37,505 --> 01:49:38,590
I'm nervous.

913
01:49:45,346 --> 01:49:46,848
I have $16 million in there.

914
01:49:49,767 --> 01:49:51,728
This is where we can change history.

915
01:49:51,895 --> 01:49:53,104
Our history.

916
01:49:54,689 --> 01:49:56,941
I'm willing to give it to you...

917
01:49:57,442 --> 01:49:58,985
if you'll let me walk.

918
01:49:59,152 --> 01:50:00,612
But...

919
01:50:02,447 --> 01:50:03,907
you won't do that, will you?

920
01:50:06,743 --> 01:50:08,119
No.

921
01:50:08,328 --> 01:50:09,370
No, no, no.

922
01:50:11,371 --> 01:50:12,458
Well...

923
01:50:15,376 --> 01:50:17,462
Excuse me, but...

924
01:50:19,797 --> 01:50:22,425
you are pathetic.

925
01:50:23,259 --> 01:50:25,470
You sound like a mark.

926
01:50:25,637 --> 01:50:27,555
What happened to you, man?

927
01:50:27,722 --> 01:50:30,141
Nothing. I just know where you're going.

928
01:50:31,476 --> 01:50:33,144
I tell you...

929
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:35,313
that night in the taxi...

930
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:37,941
I thought I was the lucky one,
just to be alive.

931
01:50:38,107 --> 01:50:39,442
Now...

932
01:50:39,609 --> 01:50:41,319
I think differently.

933
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:43,655
You were the lucky one.

934
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:51,663
I'm a very, very lucky man.

935
01:50:53,331 --> 01:50:56,417
Well, no more chitchat.

936
01:51:01,673 --> 01:51:03,258
Good luck.

937
01:51:22,986 --> 01:51:25,280
Electra, where are you?
Electra, talk to me.

938
01:51:27,699 --> 01:51:29,367
Rath...

939
01:51:35,415 --> 01:51:37,458
Can you hear me?
Rath, can you hear me?

940
01:51:38,918 --> 01:51:41,546
Fuck. Fuck.

941
01:51:48,553 --> 01:51:52,265
Everything is in order.
Please, come with me.

942
01:52:14,829 --> 01:52:17,665
This is awkward.
It's not really my affair...

943
01:52:17,832 --> 01:52:21,461
but I was told you would give us
something in return.

944
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:44,067
Oh, God, I'm fucked.
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

945
01:53:06,047 --> 01:53:08,466
- Okay.
- Now...

946
01:53:08,633 --> 01:53:10,134
we are closed, señor.

947
01:53:34,283 --> 01:53:36,577
Come on. Come on.

948
01:53:37,328 --> 01:53:40,039
Step outside, Rath.

949
01:53:40,206 --> 01:53:41,791
Step outside...

950
01:53:41,958 --> 01:53:43,501
and I'll set you free.

951
01:53:43,668 --> 01:53:47,588
Excuse me, sir,
would you please sign this receipt?

952
01:53:49,298 --> 01:53:50,883
Come on.

953
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:52,635
I got the sword...

954
01:53:52,802 --> 01:53:54,178
right here.

955
01:53:55,138 --> 01:53:57,890
There is no shame. Fuck.

956
01:53:58,057 --> 01:54:00,268
You won't feel a thing.

957
01:54:02,019 --> 01:54:07,275
- Well, thank you for your business, sir.
- You're welcome.

958
01:54:20,371 --> 01:54:22,832
Here he is. Here he is.

959
01:54:23,624 --> 01:54:25,251
Thank you, sir.

960
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:33,050
Electra, we've got it. We did it.

961
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:38,139
Come on. Step outside.

962
01:54:38,306 --> 01:54:41,809
We're in. You there?

963
01:54:41,976 --> 01:54:43,060
Electra, where are you?

964
01:54:49,942 --> 01:54:51,694
You there?

965
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,071
Yeah.

966
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,699
- Yeah.
- Can you hear me?

967
01:54:57,450 --> 01:55:00,745
Look up.
I wanna see your eyes, motherfucker.

968
01:55:02,079 --> 01:55:03,581
Look up.

969
01:55:23,935 --> 01:55:25,186
- Jasmine?
- Howdy.

970
01:56:15,361 --> 01:56:17,154
Electra!

971
01:56:19,156 --> 01:56:20,157
Yes.

972
01:56:23,411 --> 01:56:26,664
You have something
that belongs to me. I need it now.

973
01:56:35,965 --> 01:56:39,218
- Shit.
- I got something for you here.

974
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:47,560
- What the fuck do I do with this?
- Two against one!

975
01:56:47,727 --> 01:56:50,188
Is that your edge, Rath?

976
01:56:51,731 --> 01:56:53,316
You didn't take the mark.

977
01:56:53,482 --> 01:56:55,693
- You took the bribe.
- Found it.

978
01:57:02,033 --> 01:57:04,869
Don't worry. Don't worry, I'll take her.

979
01:57:05,036 --> 01:57:07,538
- I'll take her.
- He's serious, Rath.

980
01:57:07,705 --> 01:57:09,540
Even the odds.

981
01:57:10,458 --> 01:57:13,294
Are you scared, honey?

982
01:57:13,544 --> 01:57:15,880
I'm gonna find you.

983
01:57:33,856 --> 01:57:38,569
I told you
I was going to tear your heart out!

984
01:57:40,404 --> 01:57:42,365
And I will.

985
01:57:43,074 --> 01:57:45,368
I will!

986
01:57:46,118 --> 01:57:48,079
I promise you that!

987
01:59:08,659 --> 01:59:10,327
Wait here.

988
01:59:25,676 --> 01:59:27,428
Electra, I told you to stay up there.

989
01:59:27,595 --> 01:59:29,472
- I'm not gonna.
- Electra, this is...

990
01:59:29,638 --> 01:59:31,182
- The floor could give way.
- You could...

991
01:59:31,348 --> 01:59:32,475
Goddamn it, why can't you...?

992
01:59:35,227 --> 01:59:36,520
Don't move.

993
01:59:37,521 --> 01:59:38,564
Throw it away.

994
01:59:39,231 --> 01:59:40,983
Throw it away.

995
01:59:45,362 --> 01:59:47,114
That was no way to talk to a lady.

996
01:59:49,825 --> 01:59:51,327
No.

997
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:55,706
Nicolai.

998
02:00:01,337 --> 02:00:02,880
It's been a long time, my friend.

999
02:00:09,428 --> 02:00:11,347
The years have been good to you,
Robert.

1000
02:00:12,848 --> 02:00:14,558
Miguelito?

1001
02:00:14,892 --> 02:00:17,394
Never pictured him so young. A shame.

1002
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:19,230
Second best, after all.

1003
02:00:19,396 --> 02:00:20,689
He killed you...

1004
02:00:20,856 --> 02:00:24,193
- 15 years ago. He killed you.
- Yes, he did.

1005
02:00:25,152 --> 02:00:26,195
I don't understand.

1006
02:00:26,362 --> 02:00:30,324
Walking out of that bank
was the worst moment of my life.

1007
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:33,536
He always went for the heart.

1008
02:00:34,703 --> 02:00:35,746
Predictable.

1009
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:42,670
Fifteen years.

1010
02:00:44,129 --> 02:00:46,966
For 15 goddamn years...

1011
02:00:47,967 --> 02:00:50,469
you let me think I'd killed you.

1012
02:00:53,138 --> 02:00:55,182
Son of a bitch.

1013
02:00:56,559 --> 02:00:58,102
Son of a bitch.

1014
02:00:58,269 --> 02:01:02,481
You're forgetting you shot me.
You son of a bitch.

1015
02:01:02,648 --> 02:01:05,651
Why? Why did you set me up?

1016
02:01:05,818 --> 02:01:07,611
The Cold War was ending.

1017
02:01:07,778 --> 02:01:09,446
I needed to die...

1018
02:01:09,613 --> 02:01:12,116
to leave no past behind.

1019
02:01:12,283 --> 02:01:14,368
You delivered me.

1020
02:01:15,578 --> 02:01:18,706
- You must be the mark?
- You must be the contractor.

1021
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:22,877
I'm disappointed, Robert.
You were supposed to kill her.

1022
02:01:29,341 --> 02:01:31,302
You're a thief.

1023
02:01:32,344 --> 02:01:34,054
A good one.

1024
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:37,975
I retired.

1025
02:01:38,142 --> 02:01:39,894
You were so good.

1026
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:43,272
I had to use both my best
to track you down.

1027
02:01:44,148 --> 02:01:47,151
There's something on that disk
that would bring you back to life?

1028
02:01:47,318 --> 02:01:50,112
Enough information to expose us all.

1029
02:01:50,279 --> 02:01:51,780
Especially me.

1030
02:01:55,326 --> 02:01:58,245
Why can't you two
just kiss and make up?

1031
02:01:58,996 --> 02:02:01,290
This is sad for me, Robert.

1032
02:02:01,749 --> 02:02:05,002
Sentimental, but I did not want
to find you alive.

1033
02:02:07,671 --> 02:02:08,964
First things first.

1034
02:02:26,857 --> 02:02:28,150
Jesus, don't do this.

1035
02:02:32,404 --> 02:02:33,698
She's right.

1036
02:02:34,865 --> 02:02:35,950
She's always right.

1037
02:02:36,992 --> 02:02:38,827
- Female intuition.
- Yeah.

1038
02:02:42,998 --> 02:02:44,708
Where are you going, Miguelito?

1039
02:02:45,626 --> 02:02:47,169
To finish something...

1040
02:02:48,003 --> 02:02:50,047
you didn't finish years ago.

1041
02:02:50,589 --> 02:02:51,674
What's that?

1042
02:02:56,887 --> 02:02:58,806
Just to make sure.

1043
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:05,437
Take it.

1044
02:03:07,731 --> 02:03:09,566
Are you gonna kill me now?

1045
02:03:09,733 --> 02:03:12,695
I never wanted to kill you
in the first place.

1046
02:03:17,032 --> 02:03:19,201
Come on. Help me up.

1047
02:03:19,994 --> 02:03:23,580
- Will you?
- Don't even breathe hard.

1048
02:03:28,419 --> 02:03:30,462
Do you wanna die, Miguelito?

1049
02:03:34,049 --> 02:03:35,426
Help me up.

1050
02:03:38,971 --> 02:03:39,998
Come on...

1051
02:03:44,601 --> 02:03:46,270
Thank you.

1052
02:03:49,732 --> 02:03:51,108
So...

1053
02:03:52,109 --> 02:03:53,193
Now what?

1054
02:03:54,903 --> 02:03:56,196
I'm finished.

1055
02:03:57,156 --> 02:03:58,490
What do you mean finished?

1056
02:03:59,283 --> 02:04:01,160
The history stops here.

1057
02:04:01,326 --> 02:04:02,745
No more.

1058
02:04:02,911 --> 02:04:04,705
I'm gone.

1059
02:04:04,872 --> 02:04:05,914
I quit.

1060
02:04:16,133 --> 02:04:18,302
That would make me number one.

1061
02:04:19,469 --> 02:04:21,221
Number one.

1062
02:04:24,308 --> 02:04:26,810
I can live with that. Can you?

1063
02:04:32,983 --> 02:04:37,571
Then live with it, Miguel. Live with it.

1064
02:04:41,408 --> 02:04:43,327
It was very nice meeting you...

1065
02:04:44,036 --> 02:04:45,788
Robert Rath.

1066
02:04:45,954 --> 02:04:48,332
It was very dangerous meeting you,
Miguel Bain.

1067
02:05:01,804 --> 02:05:02,846
You know...

1068
02:05:03,847 --> 02:05:05,474
as long as you are out there...

1069
02:05:07,226 --> 02:05:08,852
I'll never be number one.

1070
02:05:11,897 --> 02:05:14,608
Say goodbye, Bobby.

1071
02:05:17,027 --> 02:05:18,362
No.

1072
02:05:19,238 --> 02:05:21,323
No goodbyes.

1073
02:05:23,033 --> 02:05:24,034
Goodbye, Miguel.

1074
02:05:52,771 --> 02:05:54,439
Thank you.

1075
02:06:02,781 --> 02:06:04,366
Wait a minute.

1076
02:06:14,918 --> 02:06:17,212
I think you'd better keep the disc, Robert.

1077
02:06:17,379 --> 02:06:20,716
- Joseph. My real name is Joseph.
- Oh, yeah? I'm Anna.

1078
02:06:20,883 --> 02:06:22,551
Nice to meet you, Joseph.

1079
02:06:22,718 --> 02:06:25,470
So, Joseph, let's go get Pearl
a boyfriend.

1080
02:06:25,637 --> 02:06:30,225
Sure. And after that, if you
don't mind, I'd like to go to the hospital.

1081
02:06:31,305 --> 02:07:31,460
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
