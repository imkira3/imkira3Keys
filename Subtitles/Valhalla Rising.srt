2
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:17,560
He's never belonged to anyone
for more than five years.

3
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,108
Your time has passed.

4
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,155
Mine has come.

5
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:07,349
They're bastards, these people.

6
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,730
These followers of the white Christ.

7
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,482
Bastards.

8
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:24,199
A much travelled man once told me
that they eat their own God.

9
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:29,371
Eat his flesh, drink his blood.

10
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,208
Abominable.

11
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:40,174
And they hate us... want us dead.

12
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:48,557
So you pray to the gods to protect us.

13
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,896
We have many gods.

14
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:57,983
They've only got the one.

15
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,459
Can't let him go.

16
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:18,837
We need him.

17
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:23,008
You need money, chieftain.

18
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,637
Like everyone else.

19
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:31,433
It's the only way to reason
with the Christians.

20
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,938
You might as well get it from me.

21
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:40,919
Who are you?

22
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,184
Hood him.

23
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:58,437
Take him away.

24
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:28,170
What do you see?

25
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,927
Yourself?

26
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,142
When I die...

27
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:46,897
...you will go back to hell.

28
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,917
He's driven by hate.

29
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,422
It's how he survives.

30
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,926
Why he never loses.

31
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:04,099
He'll come because he has to come.

32
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:08,228
To finish it.

33
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:24,447
Do you like it?

34
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:30,203
My father gave it to me, I think.

35
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,299
Are you from the clans, warrior?

36
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:13,348
No.

37
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,852
Why does the boy speak for you?

38
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,115
Are you Christians?

39
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,704
Yes.

40
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:41,376
You're lying.

41
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:46,047
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I've heard about him.

42
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:49,843
He's one of the biggest savages
in Sutherland.

43
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:56,599
Killed our chieftain's son,
and most of his men, as well.

44
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,733
Son.

45
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:14,552
Does the mute have a name?

46
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,933
His name is One-Eye.

47
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:21,768
One-Eye.

48
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,524
You can eat with us. Then we can talk.

49
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,944
Or at least, the boy can.

50
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,910
You need a name.

51
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,790
And you've only got one eye.

52
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:52,215
So... now you've got your freedom,

53
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,426
what do you plan to do with it?

54
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,640
I wanna go home.

55
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:04,811
Where is that?

56
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:14,320
Don't know.

57
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:19,033
Maybe he could bring us luck.

58
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:29,085
One-Eye...
I could use a good fighter like you.

59
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,132
We're God's own soldiers, warrior.

60
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:40,930
Heading for Jerusalem...
to reconquer the Holy Land.

61
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:46,603
There's great honour in it.

62
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,607
Riches. Land.

63
00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:52,650
Isn't that right, soldier?

64
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,903
Yeah.

65
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:58,239
That's right.

66
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:05,872
Endless warfare.

67
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,919
It makes more tramps than heroes.

68
00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:19,010
But you should come with us
to Jerusalem.

69
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:25,642
Your sins will be absolved,
whether you live or die.

70
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:30,730
You will see your loved ones again.

71
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:38,112
Boy.

72
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,742
Where does he come from?

73
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,580
He was brought up from hell.

74
00:27:57,925 --> 00:27:59,968
So where is it, this hell?

75
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:04,847
On the other side of the ocean.

76
00:28:08,143 --> 00:28:10,895
We're more than flesh and blood.

77
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:15,149
More than revenge.

78
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,612
All of these things go.

79
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,452
You should consider your soul.

80
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,164
That's where the real pain lies.

81
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,393
Do you think he'll come back?

82
00:28:57,818 --> 00:28:59,902
If it's God's will.

83
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,122
My father told so many tales
of the Holy Land.

84
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:40,378
And I never tired of listening to him.

85
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:46,592
All about its beauty.

86
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:49,846
Its wealth.

87
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:00,606
Do you know what I do
when I'm scared?

88
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:05,778
I pray to Christ.

89
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:09,824
Do you know who he is?

90
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:14,996
He sacrificed his life...

91
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,167
...so that we could be free

92
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:22,545
from pain and misery.

93
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:30,178
You see, that's what we're doing.

94
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:35,808
We're going to protect his land,
his kingdom.

95
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:39,979
So you have to be strong.

96
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:07,340
Never seen a mist
like this before.

97
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,844
So far from a shore.

98
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,183
It's been how long?

99
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,269
Days?

100
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:23,022
Perhaps it's a curse.

101
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:26,108
It's not a curse.

102
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,278
It's just a mist, nothing more.

103
00:32:46,588 --> 00:32:49,465
This ship is yours, Lord.

104
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:52,677
These men are yours, Lord.

105
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:57,431
These swords we bear are for you, Lord.

106
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,519
We ask you to send the wind
to lift this mist.

107
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:04,981
We ask you, Lord, to send the wind

108
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:10,528
to guide us on the path to your land,
to the Holy Land.

109
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:15,116
We ask you, Lord,
to put your hand with our hands,

110
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,743
to guide us to your kingdom.

111
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,955
Don't do it again. You'll die.

112
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,964
You're dead.

113
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:19,096
You see, that's what we are doing.

114
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:24,685
We are going to protect his land,
his kingdom.

115
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,994
So you have to be strong.

116
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:04,618
No winds.

117
00:36:08,623 --> 00:36:10,249
No current.

118
00:36:14,629 --> 00:36:16,255
It's a curse.

119
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:22,470
Do you think the boy
could be the cause of this?

120
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:25,306
Of course.

121
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:31,353
How are we gonna kill him?

122
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,153
I'll do it.

123
00:37:23,156 --> 00:37:25,199
- It was the boy.
- Shut up!

124
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,078
- He killed one of our men.
- Back off.

125
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:31,997
- Do something.
- I warned you what would happen.

126
00:37:32,165 --> 00:37:34,959
Now, back off.

127
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:51,452
The boy said he was from hell.

128
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:57,082
Maybe that's where we're going.

129
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:19,933
You want me to die?

130
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:55,135
It's fresh water.

131
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:39,800
It's a river.

132
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:16,678
I'm gonna show them
a man of God has arrived.

133
00:51:41,472 --> 00:51:45,266
So... if we're not in the Holy Land...

134
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:51,690
...then where the hell are we?

135
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,545
Where did you get that?

136
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:48,997
Where is he?

137
00:52:52,793 --> 00:53:07,974
Hello!

138
00:53:16,233 --> 00:53:18,318
He killed him.

139
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:24,741
One-Eye's gonna kill us all.

140
00:53:29,997 --> 00:53:32,123
One by one.

141
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:49,974
I had a dream about this once.

142
00:53:54,313 --> 00:53:56,356
I couldn't find my way home...

143
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,779
...and then I realised I was dead.

144
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:12,205
What are we going to do
about our friend?

145
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,918
Leave a sword.

146
00:54:17,086 --> 00:54:20,755
If he finds it, it's God's will.

147
00:54:24,635 --> 00:54:27,971
We have to keep moving,
find out where we are.

148
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:11,431
It's the fucking mud!
Get us out of the fucking mud!

149
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,350
- Leave him!
- Help me!

150
00:55:14,518 --> 00:55:16,603
Fuck off!

151
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:22,358
- Let's get ashore and fight!
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

152
00:55:22,526 --> 00:55:23,985
Move!

153
00:57:03,794 --> 00:57:05,878
Look at this.

154
00:57:10,217 --> 00:57:12,343
Stone.

155
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,347
That's iron.

156
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:21,978
They're primitives.

157
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:27,025
God brought us out of that mist
for a reason.

158
00:57:27,985 --> 00:57:31,154
We claim this land in his name.

159
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:34,991
How do we do that?

160
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:40,204
We're half starved.

161
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,916
Three men dead.

162
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:46,169
One missing.

163
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,304
Can you hear me?

164
01:06:29,734 --> 01:06:31,819
We left your sword.

165
01:06:36,241 --> 01:06:38,325
Can you not hear him?

166
01:06:41,204 --> 01:06:43,289
He talks.

167
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:46,959
Who?

168
01:06:50,255 --> 01:06:52,089
One-Eye.

169
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,845
What's he saying?

170
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,307
He says we're in hell.

171
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:17,114
I told you, he brought us here.

172
01:07:22,662 --> 01:07:24,747
We have to leave this place.

173
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:29,960
We have to go into the forest.

174
01:07:31,504 --> 01:07:34,131
Is he speaking through you now?

175
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:37,885
It's the only way out.

176
01:07:38,011 --> 01:07:40,888
What do you mean, out?

177
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,641
Home.

178
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,560
- We have to go back.
- Back to that mist?

179
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:49,980
- Have you lost your mind?
- We have to find salt water.

180
01:07:50,148 --> 01:07:53,525
- That's the road out of here.
- No.

181
01:07:53,693 --> 01:07:56,153
We stay and show them
what men are capable of

182
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,280
when they act in the name of God.

183
01:07:58,406 --> 01:08:01,867
We've raised the cross.
Now we bring the sword.

184
01:08:02,035 --> 01:08:05,704
The heathen will be converted,
their sins cleansed,

185
01:08:05,872 --> 01:08:08,415
a new Jerusalem established!

186
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:15,130
You promised us riches.
And the Holy Lands.

187
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:18,968
Well, One-Eye took us to hell.

188
01:08:19,135 --> 01:08:21,887
And there is no God.

189
01:08:58,675 --> 01:09:00,759
No.

190
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:12,289
We need to follow him.

191
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:34,978
My lifelong friend.

192
01:10:35,146 --> 01:10:37,689
Will you turn your back on me?

193
01:10:49,702 --> 01:10:51,829
Go on, then.

194
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:57,126
Turn your back on God.

195
01:10:58,336 --> 01:11:03,966
Only men of faith deserve the riches
of my new Jerusalem!

196
01:11:35,665 --> 01:11:38,041
I will build crosses
up and down the river

197
01:11:38,209 --> 01:11:41,211
to guide our brothers
when they come to join us.

198
01:11:44,382 --> 01:11:46,425
They'll bring women.

199
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:53,265
Our cities will stand
for a thousand years.

200
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:56,727
And you...

201
01:11:57,937 --> 01:12:01,398
...spiritual advisor
in my new Jerusalem.

202
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:18,530
Could I ever forgive my father
for bringing me to this place?

203
01:16:24,203 --> 01:16:28,498
I came here to beg forgiveness
from my sons.

204
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:39,468
I wasn't there when they died in battle.

205
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:48,977
It matters, doesn't it...

206
01:16:52,398 --> 01:16:54,399
...how I leave?

207
01:16:58,863 --> 01:17:00,906
Yes.

208
01:17:12,877 --> 01:17:14,920
Tell me...

209
01:17:20,343 --> 01:17:22,385
He says I'm gonna reach the sea.

210
01:17:27,433 --> 01:17:29,559
Gonna build a new boat.

211
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,024
Gonna go home.

212
01:17:40,404 --> 01:17:42,531
What does he say about me?

213
01:17:54,168 --> 01:17:56,294
You're gonna die.

214
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:01,049
Then he's lying.

215
01:18:04,387 --> 01:18:09,599
If he's lying...
why are you following him?

216
01:18:23,948 --> 01:18:25,991
Why did I come here, One-Eye?

217
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:32,789
Why did I have to go through this?

218
01:18:36,168 --> 01:18:38,253
Tell me.

219
01:19:03,988 --> 01:19:06,072
I have to go back.

220
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:11,828
I have to be with my father.

221
01:19:19,211 --> 01:19:21,338
Even if he's dead.

222
01:19:23,966 --> 01:19:26,051
Your sons are dead...

223
01:19:28,137 --> 01:19:30,347
...and you came here to be with them.
