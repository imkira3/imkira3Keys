1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,155
<i>There's a magic that
happens when you dance.</i>

3
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,365
<i>Everything lines up. The world is in sync.</i>

4
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,620
<i>And for one perfect moment,</i>

5
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,332
<i>you feel totally alive.</i>

6
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,581
<i>But to make a living as a dancer</i>

7
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,167
<i>you go through stuff that
doesn't feel so magical.</i>

8
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,256
<i>The rejection.</i>

9
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,712
<i>Crappy Pay-</i>

10
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,468
<i>Endless auditions.</i>

11
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,237
<i>That's when it feels like your world</i>

12
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,221
<i>shrinks down to the same cold room.</i>

13
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:54,309
<i>The same fluorescent
lights and the same indifferent people</i>

14
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,356
<i>day after day.</i>

15
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,644
<i>That's where my Hollywood story begins.</i>

16
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,320
All right, thanks for coming in today.

17
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,568
Uh, you guys know everybody here.

18
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,274
Can you
take off, um...

19
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,825
Take your shirts off.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,527
Yeah, just take your shirts off.

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,657
Oh, yeah, no shirts.

22
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,744
Good. That's good.

23
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:17,999
That's good.

24
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,382
That's great. Can you come forward?

25
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,959
And go backwards.

26
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,669
Can you just step to your left, please?

27
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,379
Just find the light to your left.

28
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,339
But as you're going left,
you need to go right.

29
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,648
I want you to feel the feeling
of feeling the product.

30
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,523
Good. And use the product.

31
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,704
I just want the feeling
that your hose is your family.

32
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,128
And I want you to, um, make love to it.

33
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,705
- Oh.
- But not in a weird way.

34
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,755
- That's good.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

35
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,601
Good. More, more!

36
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,108
Less, <i>less!</i>

37
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,025
Yeah, I wasn't expecting a beard.

38
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,110
I like the beard.

39
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,195
No, we need the beard to go.
Beard's gotta go.

40
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,155
- Beard's not going.
- The beard should go now.

41
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,365
Are you willing to shave your beard?

42
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,791
Yeah, I'll shave it off. Absolutely.

43
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,834
- You'll shave? He'll shave.
- Yeah.

44
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,002
- Yeah.
- Come on, please?

45
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,546
Thank you.

46
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,645
This is not working.

47
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,986
- What are you doin'? What's wrong with you?
- Oh.

48
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,203
- Mmm.
- Oh. That's nice.

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,367
Hey!

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,117
You gonna let her walk past you like that?

51
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,042
Yeah, exactly what was that?

52
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,246
Dawg, you gotta move on.

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,621
Huh?

54
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,171
Emily's on tour. All right? It's over.

55
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,759
Hot girl looks at you like that,
man, you gotta handle it.

56
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,358
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know better than that.

57
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,096
I know how I'd handle it.

58
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,224
Sorry, everyone, looks like
we found what we're looking for

59
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,772
and we're out of time
for today, so thanks again.

60
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,272
Are you serious? Come on.
We've been out here for three hours.

61
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,772
That's how it goes.

62
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,274
Thank you so much, Elizabeth.
Appreciate it.

63
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,605
Always a pleasure, Jasper.

64
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,156
Yes, it is.

65
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,196
Nice hats.

66
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,487
Ole.

67
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,156
Ole?

68
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,533
Shit.

69
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,953
Bad. That was bad.

70
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,538
<i>I</i> don't get it.

71
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,589
I actually had a good
feeling about this one.

72
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,666
Yeah. That one, and the one before,

73
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,299
and all the other ones that we didn't get.

74
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,345
Yeah, I thought LA was supposed to be

75
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,594
the place where dreams actually happen.

76
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,550
No, what actually happens is that

77
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,057
we keep putting on this
stupid shit for nothing.

78
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,764
Where did you find these anyway?
Actually, I don't wanna know.

79
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,394
In the dumpster behind El Compadre.

80
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,568
It's called vintage, boo.

81
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,164
Y'all act like we can afford new ones.

82
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,321
No, that's
called nasty.

83
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,693
- That's gross.
- Honestly, I can't take this anymore.

84
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,025
I really can't. You know?

85
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,737
All right. Let's just chalk this
up <i>as</i> another crappy audition.

86
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,243
Every audition is a crappy audition.

87
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,116
I thought we were on our way.

88
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,998
We move out here. We do the
big Nike ad. Everything's looking good.

89
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,875
And then nothing.

90
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,457
I hate to say it, but what
are we still doing here?

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,542
I feel you, bro.

92
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,423
Okay, it's been rough.

93
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,466
We gotta blow off some steam.

94
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,973
I know what we need.

95
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,812
Yo, The Mob is in the house, y'all!

96
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,891
What's up, Sean?

97
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,311
Brother, how you doin', man?

98
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,529
Oh, my man!

99
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,608
That's my man.
How you feelin', man? All right?

100
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,783
How many of y'all tonight?

101
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:59,860
The whole Mob.

102
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,195
Y'all always roam in packs, though.

103
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,451
I don't know why you gotta
do that to a brother.

104
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,624
Told you, this is what we needed.

105
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,598
Let's have
a good night, y'all.

106
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,745
Oh. What the...

107
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,050
Hey! It's the mariachi band from earlier.

108
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,968
You ladies play us something saucy?

109
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,388
That's cute. That necklace is cute,
too. You get that at Claire's?

110
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,008
Man, you spend all day comin' up with that?

111
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,685
You musta had a lotta
free time after not getting that gig.

112
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,228
Whatever, man, just get outta here.

113
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,351
We're just tryin' to have a good time.

114
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,602
Man, we ain't goin' nowhere.

115
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,898
We came here to do a little dancin'.

116
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,146
Unless that's a problem for you.

117
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,148
It is. So go.

118
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,446
Maybe we should settle it.

119
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,489
You wanna battle on the floor?

120
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,215
Please, let's not do it, all right?
Are we really doing this?

121
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,235
Right. Listen, please.

122
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,697
This guy's a douche, man. And I'm not
tryin' to get all sweaty in this.

123
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,076
Battling him is not the move.

124
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,533
Look, what's the problem?

125
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,039
Did the three amigos
forget their sombreros?

126
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,540
Mexican reference'? Good job, man.

127
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,042
This guy's a dick. Come on. Let's just go.

128
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,121
No, no.

129
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,043
You picked the wrong
night to get in my face, little man.

130
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,135
Are you having a tough day?

131
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,095
It must suck to be hot for five minutes,

132
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,266
then realize that your
flash mob ain't nothin' but a joke.

133
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,763
Whatever, man,
you're a joke!

134
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,265
Okay, yeah, we got that.
That's awesome. Thank you, man.

135
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,642
Look, we've been there and done that.

136
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,769
Let this go. Let's just go.

137
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,192
No, we came here to dance, right?

138
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,772
Why don't we line it up for
these clowns. Come on, let's go.

139
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,860
Come on.

140
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,380
Whoo!

141
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,954
Oh!

142
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,469
Yo!

143
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,265
Aah!

144
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,454
Grim Knights!
Grim Knights! Grim Knights!

145
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,377
That's the last time I make
a fool out of myself for you. That's it.

146
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,739
Way to look out for
the crew, bro. Thanks, man.

147
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,582
I'm outta here.

148
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,972
Hey, man, easy come, easy go, bro.

149
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,971
If everybody could make it,
it wouldn't be Hollywood.

150
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,111
- What time was lunch?
- Like 2:30.

151
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,567
There you are, man.

152
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,822
What is this?

153
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,945
Look, we been talkin' about it, man,

154
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,827
and it's time to go home, Sean.

155
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,160
I mean, we've gone hard.
And it's nothing to be ashamed of.

156
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,584
Then what? You're just gonna bail?

157
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,540
All of you?

158
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,462
Yo, man, wake up, man!

159
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,591
When are you gonna stop
acting like everything is just okay?

160
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,014
This crew's not ready for LA, man.

161
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,762
I don't know how you don't see that.

162
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,811
Because we made 50 grand off the Nike spot.

163
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,307
Yeah. Six months ago.

164
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,105
And split 12 ways.

165
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,478
Dawg, I spend more
money on gas going to auditions

166
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,730
than most people do on rent.

167
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,779
I'm over it. I'm done, man.

168
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,490
So what are you gonna do?

169
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,899
Hmm?

170
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,320
You gonna go back to Miami?

171
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,747
We're just all tapped out, man.

172
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,995
Dude, we're 40 days late on our rent.

173
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,291
43.

174
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,916
I've run out of stuff to sell
on eBay, man. I have nothing.

175
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,001
Man, let’s just call it what it is,
all right? We're ready to go back.

176
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,632
So quit then. Go crawling
back to Miami. Go ahead.

177
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,213
- Ain't gotta be like this.
- Yeah, it does.

178
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,014
Sorry, I'm not leavin'.

179
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,382
Really?

180
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,768
Yeah. I'm stayin' here.

181
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,440
All right, peace, man.

182
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,853
Hold up.

183
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,827

Lookin' good.

200
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,125
Yo, man, you shoulda called me sooner.

201
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,327
I had no idea you needed a job.

202
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,289
Yeah. Thank you.
Things have been a little rough.

203
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,497
Well, this is perfect!

204
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,299
My grandparents have been
looking for someone to help out.

205
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,376
Come on, I'll introduce you. Glad you came.

206
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,883
How's Camille'? You guys likin' LA?

207
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,592
Yeah, she's great. LA's fun.
What's not to like about LA?

208
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,937
Rumba's the dance of love, Miss Nakamura.

209
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,897
It's a courtship ritual.

210
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,228
That's Chad.

211
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,689
Copy me. Quick, slow, quick, slow.

212
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:03,944
<i>Baba!</i>

213
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,652
You must be Sean.

214
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,785
Mooski, you didn't tell me
your friend was so cute.

215
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,662
Thanks for letting me stay here.

216
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,788
You're welcome.

217
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,285
Oh. Finally, you are here.

218
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,372
The women's toilet
is leaking like a broken faucet.

219
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,674
And faucet is broken, too. Please fix.

220
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,719
Here. You are sleeping here
in the closets of storage.

221
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,922
Please, drop bag and get to work.

222
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,219
<i>Opa, he just got in. Let him same in first.</i>

223
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,847
Come on, I'll buy you a smoothie

224
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,098
before you get your hands dirty.

225
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,896
Go! Have smoothie. This can wait.

226
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,849
Okay-

227
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,528
Have you heard of The Vortex?

228
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,616
Uh. That's something on VH1, right?

229
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,575
What? Camille loves VH1.

230
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,122
Hey, nothin'.

231
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,830
No, but you should
totally enter that. Call The Mob.

232
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,747
No, come on, man.
The Mob is like the king of the streets.

233
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,878
I mean, sure, you and Eddy
had a little fallout or whatever.

234
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,709
But you can't enter alone.

235
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,671
I mean, don't get me wrong.

236
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,757
Back in the day, I woulda tore that
thing up. Y'know what I'm sayin'?

237
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,765
I mean, that's not a bad idea.
You and I on a crew together.

238
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,187
Come on.

239
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,436
I would love to, but I have
a job now, man. I'm an engineer.

240
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,940
Come on, man.
You're the Moose. There's only one Moose.

241
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,299
My life's totally different now.

242
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,276
I've got a lot of responsibility.

243
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,857
Dance competitions are fun and all,

244
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,317
but they're not really gonna pay the bills.

245
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,323
No, but that's the beauty of it, man.

246
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,030
This competition does pay
the bills. For a while, too.

247
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,660
I get it, man. I just...

248
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,087
I can't, man, I'm sorry.

249
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,174
But you should do it.

250
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,917
Yeah.

251
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,298
All right? See you around.

252
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,469
Later, man.

253
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,488
- Hello!
- Hi!

254
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,066
Welcome back.

255
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,699
- Good day?
- Yeah.

256
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,782
So how's Sean doing?

257
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,576
He's okay.

258
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,667
He's got this really crazy idea.

259
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,043
What?

260
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,795
It's honestly really crazy.

261
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,880
Remember that ad you saw
about The Vortex on VH1?

262
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,589
Yeah. What about it?

263
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,433
Yeah, well, he's thinking
about entering it.

264
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,636
And he can kinda pull it off.

265
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,688
But the only thing is he
doesn't have anyone to do it with.

266
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,232
And, so, well...

267
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,105
He kinda asked me to do it.

268
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,568
He asked you?

269
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,112
I know. Crazy, right?

270
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,314
Uh...

271
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,781
- And?
- No, no, no, I can't.

272
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,658
It's completely impractical.

273
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,662
So you have no interest in dancing at all?

274
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,287
Nope. Pretty sure that
part of my life is over.

275
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,170
Yup. I don't really even
think about it anymore, really.

276
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,801
Yeah. it was the right call.

277
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,594
What would you tell Mr. McGowan?

278
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,468
And how would you pull
a crew together that fast?

279
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,844
Exactly.

280
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,846
It's not like you've been keeping
up with training or anything.

281
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,302
Hey, hey, hey. I'm in shape.

282
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,103
But at that level?

283
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,556
I doubt you'd be able
to pick up where you left off.

284
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,233
Oh, come on!
The Moose does not lose these skills.

285
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,026
Shout it!

286
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,736
Wait a second. You just set me up.

287
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,320
Maybe.

288
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,994
So you really want me to do this?

289
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,625
You wanna do this.

290
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,422
And if you want something,
I want it for you.

291
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,466
Really'? 'Cause I thought you
would've thought it was crazy.

292
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,340
Please! Since when did I become that girl?

293
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,598
So you think I could swing it?
With my job and everything?

294
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,675
You're The Dancing Moose.

295
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,512
The Dancing Moose figures it out.

296
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,455
Mr. Alexander.

297
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,626
Mr. McGowan.

298
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,999
What are you doing?

299
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,079
Um...

300
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,335
Oh. It's actually a focusing exercise, sir.

301
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,466
It gets the blood flowing
faster to your brain,

302
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,925
thus causing an increase
in productivity, sir.

303
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,896
Um. You should try it sometime.
It's good for your health.

304
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,644
Actually, I was hoping
that we could talk, sir.

305
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,981
Look, my grandma's not
really doing too well,

306
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,819
and I'm the only
grandson that she kinda has out here,

307
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,155
and I promised my family
that I'd take care of her.

308
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,993
You have a grandma that
used to bake you cookies

309
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,247
and knit you sweaters.

310
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,246
My grandmother was a prison warden.

311
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,421
Oh, wow.

312
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,714
I didn't know that.

313
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,341
She must have been
a very strong, tough woman

314
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,262
who probably did have a soft side, too.

315
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,841
She was a prison warden.

316
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,676
I got that.

317
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,182
So you do understand
that from time to time,

318
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:30,984
if I need to leave work to, you
know, take her to the doctor.

319
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,356
I can admire a man who
puts his family first.

320
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,652
Thank you very much for understanding.

321
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,856
As long <i>as</i> he gets here
two hours early every morning

322
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,782
to cover the time he's missing.

323
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:39,984
Two hours?

324
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,284
Two hours.

325
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,794
Yes! Work those hips,
Miss Turnbuckle, work those hips.

326
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,341
Twerk it, Miss Turnbuckle.

327
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,261
Vegas, baby, Vegas.
We got three weeks to get ready for Vegas.

328
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,883
You comin' down from there, or what?

329
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,716
What? Oh, hell, yeah!
You better not be playin' me, man.

330
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,014
What about your job?

331
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,093
Figured it out.

332
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,308
Come on.

333
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,473
What about my job? Your grandparents?

334
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,557
Oh, they'll be all right.

335
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,233
Chad knows how to change
a light bulb. Right, Chad?

336
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,357
- Yeah.
- I know just the place to start.

337
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,780
Figure eights. Work those figure eights.

338
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,999
And we're at a fashion shoot?

339
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,331
Okay-

340
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,418
Oh, I get it. Costumes. Good thinkin'.

341
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,297
Oh, my God, that looks terrible!

342
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,256
I told you she would screw this up.

343
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,592
I look terrible?

344
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,223
I'm not finished yet.
I just need some more pins.

345
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,929
Pins won't work! What is wrong with you?

346
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,480
You are making her look fat.

347
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,556
What did <i>I</i> tell you?

348
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,732
You're making me look fat?

349
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,807
You don't look fat.

350
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,090
You need to solve this right now.
She looks like a whale.

351
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,400
Get me out of this dress.

352
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,776
Okay, I am gonna get some more pins.

353
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,983
I'm calling the designer.

354
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,626
Oh, my God, is this making me look fat?

355
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,612
Moose!
What are you doing here?

356
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,117
What do you mean? You're in our new crew.

357
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,291
We're gonna dance on live
television in Vegas... Blah blah blah!

358
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,788
Come on, we'll fill you in in the car.

359
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,620
No. Are you talking about that
Vortex thing? I have work. Can't.

360
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,047
Yo! Think this is a good look for the crew.

361
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,798
Who's the pretty boy?

362
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,471
This is Sean. He's an
amazing choreographer.

363
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,719
You've never heard of The Mob?

364
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,891
No.

365
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,685
How have you not heard of The Mob?

366
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,057
I don't get out much.

367
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,772
And, ah, who are you?

368
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,313
Hey. guys, relax, okay?

369
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,817
Andie, this is Sean. The
Mob is totally legit.

370
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,899
And, Sean, Andie
knows what she's doing. All right?

371
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,861
Cool. So she will help
with the costumes then, right?

372
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,738
This costume
girl could dance circles around your ass.

373
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,789
Okay, good to know.

374
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,250
Anytime, anyplace.

375
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,921
Okay, guys, let's just chill, all right?

376
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,418
Come on. Can we talk about this?

377
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,890
Does it always have to end up
in a big, giant dance battle?

378
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,300
What is going on here?

379
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,756
Get me off this thing!

380
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,638
All right, hang on, hang on.
Somebody get her a ladder.

381
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,469
Hang on. We'll get you down.

382
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,604
Oh, my God, the couture!

383
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,976
What is this?

384
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,643
Clean up this mess or you're fired.

385
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,608
Fired!

386
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:05,939
Eh.

387
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,695
Clean it up yourselves.

388
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,158
<i>Turns out,
Moose was well-connected.</i>

389
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,616
<i>First we found Vladd, the Human Robot.</i>

390
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,578
<i>And we all know he can do some crazy stuff.</i>

391
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,663
<i>Speaking of crazy,</i>

392
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,795
<i>we hunted down these two
busted-up sign spinners</i>

393
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,342
<i>who turned out to be...</i>

394
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,756
Moose!

395
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,836
What are you doing here?

396
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,672
<i>The Santiago Twins.</i>

397
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,224
<i>Two of the most
amazing dancers I've ever seen.</i>

398
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,475
<i>Next, Andie took us to meet Violet.</i>

399
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,524
This is Violet. Trust me, we need her.

400
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,769
<i>She makes a mean
banana split, but, hey...</i>

401
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:44,852
Ooh! That was hot.

402
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,694
<i>That's just her day job.
This girl can move.</i>

403
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,753
<i>Then calls went out to the East Coast.</i>

404
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,696
Hello?

405
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,781
<i>Jenny Kido.</i>

406
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,616
Does your aunt still have that van?

407
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,292
<i>Ditched her telemarketing job,</i>

408
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,746
<i>grabbed her aunt's van,</i>

409
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,249
<i>and hit the road.</i>

410
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,554
<i>Before heading west, she picked up Monster.</i>

411
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,269
- Monster!
- Kido!

412
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,096
Road trip! Are you in?

413
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,932
<i>A sick B-boy from the Bronx.</i>

414
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,231
<i>They swung through Baltimore
and grabbed our buddy, Hair,</i>

415
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,613
<i>who refused to come without his barber.</i>

416
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,451
<i>But, that guy could dance his ass off.</i>

417
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,243
How are you?

418
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,872
<i>Three days later,
we all showed up at the Cha Cha Palace.</i>

419
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,540
Mr. Moose!

420
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,039
Santiagos! Twin killers.

421
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,123
Hey!

422
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,633
Hi, Vladd.

423
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,007
Hi! How are you?

424
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,760
<i>Our crew was finally complete.</i>

425
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:54,973
Hi!

426
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,516
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

427
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,112
Let's call it a day, Miss Vanderblast.

428
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,770
You go take a load off those bunions.

429
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,347
Thank you.

430
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,355
That's Chad, everybody. He teaches here.

431
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,530
What's up, what's up?

432
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,534
Smooth. Are we still sayin' that?

433
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,581
Yo. So we're gonna be training here.

434
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,579
Ana and Boris already
gave us the "all clear."

435
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,258
We'll try and stay outta your way. Cool?

436
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,456
Cool.

437
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,790
Cool.

438
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,133
Okay, junior cotillion.
Today, foxtrot promenade.

439
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,928
Five minutes and we get started.

440
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,509
All right, all right.

441
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,265
Thank you all for coming out.

442
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,517
Yeah. Everybody knows why they're here.

443
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,690
This isn't just another dance competition.

444
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,644
We win this thing and we get our own show.

445
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,854
For three years.

446
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,612
That means quitting our day
jobs and dancing full-time.

447
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,240
The first round of The Vortex
is a video submission.

448
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,287
That's right. We got
some really cool ideas.

449
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,207
I work at a lab. And my boss is
at a conference next week,

450
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,882
and if we work fast, we can
shoot our video there while he's gone.

451
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,166
Only the best of the best get in.

452
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,794
So we need to give them a show.

453
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,922
So let's get to work and put our
heads in the same place. Yeah?

454
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,093
All right, let's do it.

455
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,762
Yeah, if we rehearse every single day,

456
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,384
I don't think that'll be a problem.

457
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,758
No, it wouldn't be.

458
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,344
But we need to think and breathe as a unit.

459
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,146
Thinkin' and breathin'?
No, we need to dance. We're gonna dance.

460
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:28,522
Well, obviously, we're gonna
dance, 'cause that's why we're here.

461
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,944
So just to be clear,

462
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,396
if we're gonna be a crew,

463
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,364
who's gonna be in charge?

464
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,778
- I am.
- I am.

465
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,285
What? I'm not doin' that.

466
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,456
What? Go over there!

467
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,579
Where?

468
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,041
Yeah, come on, we're doin' it.

469
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,089
Okay, cotillion,
ignore those guys.

470
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,293
Eyes right here. Keep
your eyes on the Chad.

471
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,300
Come on. Everybody up. Let's go.

472
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,756
Okay, take your partners.

473
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,091
Just follow what I'm doin'. Go.

474
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,226
So cool.

475
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,104
Guys! Seriously?

476
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,941
Okay, let's move on.

477
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,327
Hit this hard. Come back.

478
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,494
There you go.

479
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,874
I wanna be in your crew.

480
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,839
Dude, no offense, man,

481
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,336
but the cha-cha-cha doesn't really

482
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,043
mesh with what we're doin' here.

483
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,879
Yeah. So I cha-cha with cougars?

484
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,010
Pays the bills. Chicks dig it.

485
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,260
But I have been known to get pretty crunk.

486
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,638
This competition's gonna
be hard enough as it is.

487
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,769
We don't need any
help from Rico Suave over here.

488
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:54,107
Ooh. Ouch. Rico Suave, huh?

489
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,508
You don't think I got it, do ya?

490
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,984
Do you wanna see what I got?

491
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:03,287
Nope. No, I don't wanna
see what you've got.

492
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,454
Hit the music.

493
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,948
Watch.

494
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,235
That was great!

495
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,607
Bravo!

496
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,487
I can't believe it.

497
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,689
Whatever.

498
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,659
Fancy pants.

499
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,522
Mooski, take another meatball.

500
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,526
You need to be strong
tomorrow for your video.

501
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,825
I also made veggie loaf
in case anyone wants some.

502
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,701
Vegan, vaygan...

503
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,912
Vegan, Baba, vegan.

504
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,993
Foo to your vegan!

505
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,042
You need meat. Not grass.
Good for the blood.

506
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,414
Look at how she eats her balls.

507
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,746
You like the balls?

508
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,455
Yes, thank you. They're great.

509
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,917
I give you recipe. You make
for him. See how many he eats?

510
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,968
No, they're actually good.

511
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,404
Texture's a little different than
regular meatballs, though.

512
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,557
Kinda chewier.

513
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,761
That means he was a tough goat.

514
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,683
Goat?

515
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,327
Goat. You know.

516
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,816
Yeah, goat balls.

517
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,114
Yeah, they're a total
delicacy back in the old country.

518
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,442
Mmm.

519
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:51,287
And once again, veggie loaf? Anyone?

520
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,457
I like the meat.

521
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,129
Are you sure you're okay with the dishes?

522
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,334
Yeah, we got this.

523
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,964
Yeah, go. We're almost done.

524
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,967
And next time, I'm cooking dinner.

525
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,549
I do not hate that idea at all.

526
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,724
Okay. Sounds good.

527
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,473
<i>Bye.
- Adios, muchachos.</i>

528
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,807
Bye!

529
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,188
Those goat balls? Oh, my God, you
shoulda seen the look on your face.

530
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,985
Hey. I took it like a man.

531
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,028
Like a man. Right.

532
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:27,233
I didn't know if you
were gonna cry or puke.

533
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,363
You don't seem like the crying type.

534
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,819
So I seem like the puking type?

535
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,245
Well...

536
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,491
God, have you always been
such a perfectionist'?

537
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,248
I'm not a perfectionist.

538
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,458
Must have driven your ex nuts, huh?

539
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,384
She was a dancer, too, right?

540
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,965
I'm sorry. Moose told me. I didn't
know if it was a secret or anything.

541
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,095
No, it's not.

542
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,517
It was a while ago.

543
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,183
She was in my crew and...

544
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,935
She left.

545
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,061
I know all about that.

546
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,657
Can be really hard.
Dancing together. Being together.

547
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,485
Gets intense.

548
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,073
Yeah.

549
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:22,208
Look, look, look. Come here.

550
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,727
It's amazing how long
they've been together.

551
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,686
They still dance.

552
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:53,201
Wow. Moose, this
is perfect for the video.

553
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,244
Wait till you see
what I rigged up in here.

554
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,493
Dude, this place is crazy.
I can't believe you work here.

555
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,374
How long till your boss gets
back from his conference?

556
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,206
Precisely four hours and nine minutes

557
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,463
<i>as</i> long <i>as</i> he doesn't
travel faster than 67 miles per hour.

558
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,443
But we gotta work fast. Ready?

559
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,223
Who's on music? Let's roll.

560
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,426
Hmm.

561
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,052
Yo. It's so sick!

562
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,348
All right,
it's official. We're LMNTRIX.

563
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,224
LMNTRIX.

564
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:13,773
LMNTRIX! LMNTRIX! LMNTRIX!

565
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,484
Still nothin' from The Vortex?

566
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,573
Nope. Two weeks and not a thing.

567
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,659
Dude, our video was great.

568
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,537
I don't get it.

569
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,674
Yeah. I thought we killed it.

570
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,713
I wish things would just
work out just for once.

571
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,015
How'd your grandparents do it?

572
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,767
Must have been easier back in the day.

573
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,225
Was it easier back then?

574
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,025
I had to shovel...

575
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,851
Sheep poop-

576
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,564
Yeah. That's howl paid for
our shoes so we could dance.

577
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,406
Sounds terrible.

578
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,533
Are you kidding'?
It was greatest time of my life.

579
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,862
We dance all night
and forget about everything.

580
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,869
Oh, yeah. The light in
the bathroom, it needs fix.

581
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,200
And one more thing...

582
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,327
- Ana!
- What?

583
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,753
Where is the package? The lemon tricks.

584
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,828
The what?

585
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,339
The lemon tricks thing.

586
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,457
Oh.

587
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,254
Here.

588
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,888
<i>It's from The Vortex.</i>

589
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,027
<i>Welcome, Team LMNTRIX.
Your journey to The Vortex begins now.</i>

590
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,232
Vegas, baby!

591
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,689
Oh. yeah!

592
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,650
Vegas!

593
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,839
Caesars!
You guys, it's Caesars!

594
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,626
<i>Stop, stop, stop!</i>

595
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,843
Welcome to Caesars Palace.
You guys here for The Vortex?

596
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,550
All right, step right
this way to meet Alexxa.

597
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,512
So, Jasper, how did you feel
when you found out that

598
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,767
The Grim Knights will be competing here?

599
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,312
At Caesars Palace?

600
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,393
Oh, my God. So, so blessed.

601
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,604
When you grow up like I did,

602
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,735
life puts a cage around your heart.

603
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,825
All you hear is the can'ts,
the shouldn'ts, the don'ts.

604
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,701
Being in this magical place
and having this beautiful opportunity?

605
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,658
To me, that is the dream.

606
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,908
Aw.

607
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,118
Believe, yo.

608
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,120
She's so beautiful.

609
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,459
Yo.

610
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,040
That is so inspiring.

611
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,875
Thank you very much.

612
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,084
We got it. Cut.

613
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,045
Hey. Wait, wait, wait. Can we do it again?

614
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,096
I want us to do something
with a little bit more passion.

615
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,925
Maybe talk about how
I was bullied as a kid. Powder!

616
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,688
LMNTRIX? All right,
you'll do. Get up here.

617
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,182
So cute! Come here, guys.

618
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,934
Go, go, go!

619
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,227
Oh, hey.

620
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,734
It's The Lab Rats! Yeah!

621
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,115
I see you got yourself a new crew.

622
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,985
Y'all come to see some real dancin'?

623
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,741
Man, let's get outta here.

624
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,821
Ooh.

625
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,748
So it begins.

626
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:59,873
The drama! The passion! The Vortex.

627
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,497
How intimidating is it

628
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,834
to be going up against
all these tough crews?

629
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,794
No, we're excited.

630
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,972
We're a new crew.
But don't let that fool you. We're ready.

631
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,175
We been training really hard to get here.

632
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,477
Now I hear The Grim Knights
are the crew to beat.

633
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,556
How do you feel about that?

634
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,145
It's news to me.

635
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,023
We literally just arrived, so...

636
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,691
Okay. Thank you, guys.

637
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,951
Wait a minute, please!

638
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,112
It is going to be fierce.

639
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,823
I'm Alexxa Brava, and I am signing off.

640
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,129
Look at this place.

641
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,425
Smells great.

642
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,427
After that, you know what I mean?

643
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,054
Is that Sean?

644
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,556
Look who it is.

645
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,679
What are you guys doin' here?

646
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,474
What are we... What are you doing here?

647
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,058
Huh?

648
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,360
Man, it was really nice of you to call

649
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,436
your crew before you entered this thing.

650
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,443
- I know everybody's really happy with you.
Mmm-hmm.

651
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,522
- Crew?
- Mmm.

652
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,318
Oh, you mean my crew.
The crew that didn't leave me in LA.

653
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,403
Look, man, let's just
get one thing straight, all right?

654
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,239
We were done with LA,
but we were never done with The Mob.

655
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,541
Yeah. So this is your new crew?

656
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,289
Yeah, well, they ain't my book club.

657
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,249
So you called them before you called us?

658
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,498
Yeah, man.
Glad you made some new friends, bro.

659
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,561
They any good? They look pretty good.

660
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,460
Yeah, they're the best of the best.

661
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,472
The best of the best?
Oh. That's a statement right there. Yeah.

662
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,174
- As long <i>as</i> you believe that.
- I believe it.

663
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,555
Guys, we didn't get that last part.

664
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,931
Could you guys just repeat it?

665
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:41,554
What?

666
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,237
And could you be a little bit more hurt?
A little more vulnerable.

667
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,312
Who are you?

668
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,859
Could you maybe step back?

669
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,694
<i>I'm</i> with <i>The Vortex.</i>

670
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,113
- Yo, who is this guy?
- New crew.

671
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,864
- What's this about?
- Wow!

672
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,325
That was Sean's best friend.

673
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,995
Come on, let's go check out the room.

674
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,214
Welcome to your suite.

675
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,129
<i>Care of The Vortex.</i>

676
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,433
Feel it.

677
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,100
I love you, too, my little munchkin puppy.

678
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,651
Yeah, you're such a little
fluffy muffin. You're so cute.

679
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,484
We'd have the best time ever.
I wish you were here. I swear.

680
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,157
I love you, baby.

681
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,485
Camille says, "Hi."

682
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,825
Send it to her.

683
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,849
There's a huge bed upstairs.

684
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,731
Wanna check it out?

685
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,358
Gross.

686
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,819
Please go away.

687
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,495
What is that smell?

688
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,698
It's my scent.

689
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,666
Real smooth, buddy. Real smooth.

690
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,259
Hey, The Mob.

691
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,764
Anytime, baby. Mob up.

692
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:16,043
Good evening. Welcome to The Vortex.

693
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,133
Tonight, you'll meet the
dancers of tomorrow.

694
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,935
Finest in the world.

695
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,974
Each vying to be the lords of Vegas.

696
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,481
With a world-class show of their own

697
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,233
at sensational Caesars Palace!

698
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,825
Wish them luck.

699
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,195
They're gonna need it.

700
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,889
Was that hot enough for you?

701
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,607
So talented.

702
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,235
So full of hope and dreams.

703
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,900
They wish they could all stay.

704
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,660
But we only have room for four.

705
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:53,825
The crews that will
fight it out in the battle ring are...

706
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,536
Divine Intention.

707
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:07,755
Shh.

708
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,049
The Mob.

709
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,232
The Grim Knights.

710
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,954
And LMNTRIX!

711
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,333
My God!

712
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:47,921
Who ate all the muffins?

713
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,300
Andie, you did.

714
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,552
Is there more coffee?

715
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,182
Coffee.

716
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:55,262
All right, guys, we gotta
start rehearsal soon.

717
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,890
I don't think I can face
those camera crews anymore.

718
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,393
Good morning!

719
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,190
Housekeeping?

720
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,111
I got an idea.

721
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,324
This way. This is the place I told you.

722
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,405
Sean.

723
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,660
Good luck! Bye-bye!

724
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,707
Man! This is what I call
a great rehearsal space.

725
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,425
All right.

726
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:32,716
All right, yo, yo, listen up.

727
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,553
That circus up there,
the cameras, the people, the drama...

728
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,955
That's nothin' but a distraction.

729
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,532
Could keep us from winnin' this thing.

730
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,933
So let's stay focused,

731
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,056
and let's get to business.

732
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,652
Yeah!

733
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:51,859
Whoo!

734
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,028
Go!

735
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,334
And one, and two...

736
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,756
Go like this. Follow me.

737
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,887
Five, six, seven, eight.

738
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,397
Okay-

739
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,063
Okay. Ready? Let's go, come on.

740
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,989
Five, six, seven, eight.

741
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:34,569
One and two and three and four
and five and six and seven and eight.

742
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,904
Make sure these are clean.

743
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:41,743
One and two and three and four
and five and six and seven and eight.

744
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,245
Again, right away, let's go.

745
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:47,628
One and two and three and...
Stop! Stop! Stop!

746
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,266
He needs to catch on.
He's not doin' it right. Let's do it again.

747
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,928
Five, six, seven, eight.

748
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:57,725
One and two and three
and four and five and six, seven, eight.

749
00:52:58,926 --> 00:52:59,927
No!

750
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,808
Come on, that was good, man.

751
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,686
Not good enough. You wanna win?

752
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,233
I know you want this as bad as I do.

753
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,560
We're tired, man.

754
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,283
Please, help me help you guys, all right?

755
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,026
All right, I think
we've all had it for today.

756
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:15,451
Why don't you guys just
head out. We'll meet you upstairs.

757
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,369
- See you upstairs.
- Yeah.

758
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,216
Look, I wanna try this thing with you

759
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,884
that I've been imagining in my head.

760
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,971
Better be the dancing you're talking about.

761
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,047
<i>Easy.</i>

762
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,600
All right. You're gonna
put that leg right here,

763
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:44,805
that leg in my hand,

764
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,481
and hold on to my neck, okay?

765
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,059
And then what?

766
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,860
Just trust me. Okay?

767
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,903
You're so sweaty.

768
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,735
Come on, be serious. Okay?

769
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,991
So, I'm gonna jump into your other hand?

770
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,117
Yeah.

771
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,243
Okay-

772
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,326
Three, two... Go ahead.

773
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,286
- There we go.
- Oh, my God.

774
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,212
- Oh.
- We got it. We got it.

775
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:10,414
All right. I'm gonna toss you up.

776
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,498
Now what? No!

777
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:12,799
And you're gonna go into a layout.

778
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,673
No, put me down. Stop it.

779
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,596
Stop it. Put me down.

780
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,015
You gotta trust me. You gotta let go.

781
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,888
Okay, I know that you want some big,

782
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,685
cool move, but you can't force it.

783
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,353
Sounds like an excuse.

784
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,023
You saying I take
the easy way out, or something?

785
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:31,064
You don't know anything about me.

786
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,777
Do you know why I was primping
those models when we met?

787
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,858
- You know why I was doing that?
- No.

788
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,528
I was a part of this amazing dance group.

789
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:43,285
We pushed ourselves so hard
that I blew out my knee.

790
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,563
Thought I'd never dance again.

791
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,537
Yeah, really messed me up.

792
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,461
So, now, every time I come down hard,

793
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,959
I'm just waiting to hear that pop again.

794
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:57,966
Okay. Look, I get it.

795
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,923
But if you push past it
and get outta your head...

796
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,184
Oh, my gosh.

797
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,929
I can get over an old knee injury, okay?

798
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,212
I'm not scared to dance again.

799
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,316
What I don't want to risk is this.

800
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,022
I love that I'm a part of something again.

801
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,320
It's the closest thing I know to family.

802
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,028
Sure, winning, it's cool, it's great.

803
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,324
Hanging out with you guys,
though, being here.

804
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,746
Doing what I love.

805
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,242
It's all I care about.

806
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:36,007
Yeah, well, it's not enough for me.

807
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,779
Honey, I was looking for you.

808
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,250
What's wrong?

809
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,955
Sean. He's so frustrating.
He drives me crazy.

810
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,213
Do you know that he was wearing
ladies' underwear on his head

811
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,714
when I first met him?

812
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,218
That's pretty funny. You like him.

813
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,132
No, I don't.

814
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,260
He drives me nuts.

815
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,641
Yeah, that means you like him.

816
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,188
Stop it.

817
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,764
Oh.

818
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,731
What I would like is a night off. Okay?

819
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,063
Come on, we're in Vegas,
let's do something.

820
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:42,070
No, Sean will be mad if we go out.

821
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,321
Whatever.

822
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,619
Let's get the crew.

823
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,655
Hmm?

824
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,824
- Yeah? We go out?
- Yeah.

825
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,660
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay. Let's go.

826
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,836
We just gotta get there, okay?

827
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,011
Vladd, what's up?

828
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,219
I think they're in love. Kinda like us.

829
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,383
Oh.

830
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,611
Poor robot bastard.

831
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,501
Hey.

832
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:37,671
We're going out.

833
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,336
I know hanging out with us
isn't enough for you,

834
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,464
but the rest of us wanna
have some fun while we're here.

835
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,141
Wait up.

836
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:06,400
Whoa!

837
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,198
Ow!

838
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:38,974
Ha!

839
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,050
You wanna get out of here? Take a walk?

840
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,217
Yeah.

841
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,758
Hey. You were right.
This was a great idea.

842
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,603
Come on.

843
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,568
Oh, yeah.

844
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,107
Welcome to the Clark Inn.

845
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,317
Well, thank you.

846
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,075
What is this place?

847
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:35,956
Vintage...

848
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,584
Vintage Park'? Vintage Vegas Park.

849
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,659
Yeah.

850
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:45,041
So, you nervous about going
up against The Mob tomorrow?

851
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,795
Moose told me you and Eddy go way back.

852
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:55,259
We grew up together. We were like brothers.

853
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:58,970
What about you?

854
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,269
What happened between you and your ex?

855
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:05,353
Oh. Well, Moose
must have told you about Chase.

856
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,561
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

857
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:09,990
I don't know.
Long distance thing was kinda hard.

858
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,867
We were on tour, so we were always

859
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,287
on different schedules, different cities.

860
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,038
You know, it just never seemed to work.

861
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,704
But that was a really long time ago.

862
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,959
Dancing was the only
important thing to him.

863
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,084
He's an idiot.

864
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,465
Oh, my God.

865
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,017
You kidding me?

866
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,567
Thank you.

867
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,359
Old school Bobby Brown.

868
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,690
Yeah.

869
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:55,406
All right, fancy pants.

870
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,549
How come pot stickers taste
so much better in Vegas?

871
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,051
Because they're eggrolls.

872
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,262
Right? Go with this guy.

873
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,059
- Give me one.
- Try it.

874
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,512
You like it? I liked it.

875
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,347
EW!

876
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,229
Don't want your
stinky, goopy mess.

877
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,311
Come on, bro. Let it go, man.

878
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:35,980
No. No.

879
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,405
This guy's the worst.

880
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,735
- Ugh!
- Tries so hard, man. Just so hard.

881
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,661
- Yo. Mooski, this is your song.
- Yeah.

882
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,142
Come on, Moose, you gotta dance.

883
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,247
- Nah.
- Come on, Moose.

884
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,540
- Come on.
- Do it! Do it!

885
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:48,992
Give us a little sump'n.

886
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,835
Go, go, go.

887
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,717
Let's go, man.

888
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,192
What?

889
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,447
Whoa!

890
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,342
Oh, no.

891
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,783
Moose, I heard.

892
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,655
You Okay?

893
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,490
What happened to Camille?

894
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,114
I don't know, I can't find her.

895
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,665
I've called her a million times.

896
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:56,207
I'm sure she's somewhere, man.
People don't just disappear in Vegas.

897
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,959
Actually, it happens all the time.

898
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,040
I watched on TV. 20/20.

899
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,379
Scary.

900
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:03,714
Kido.

901
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,801
Oh. My bad. Sorry, Mooski. Sorry.

902
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,975
She's probably halfway to LA by now.

903
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:13,061
Come on, man.
There's no way she went all the way back.

904
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,185
I had no idea that girl was gonna kiss me.

905
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,560
Those moves?
I guess you were just too irresistible.

906
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:23,860
Look, guys, I'm sorry. All right.

907
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,816
I shouldn't be here.

908
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,572
It was all innocent fun.

909
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,090
I guess she didn't know that, but...

910
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,825
I just... I need to go home.

911
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:34,579
I mean, I love you guys. This has all
been great and fun and all, but...

912
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,829
I mean, I love Camille.

913
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:40,330
Wait. Can't this wait? We need you here.

914
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:41,756
We battle The Mob tomorrow.

915
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,966
You can't just abandon us now.

916
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,506
Yes, you can.

917
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:46,677
Are you kidding me?

918
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,300
No, I'm not kidding.

919
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,174
Get outta here.

920
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,475
Go do what you gotta do.

921
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,553
Sorry to let you guys down.

922
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,271
It's all good, bro.

923
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,114
And the winner is...

924
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,786
<i>The Grim Knights.</i>

925
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,874
Yo. Divine Intention
just got destroyed by The Grim Knights.

926
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,042
It was a massacre.

927
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,211
How we gonna
do this without Moose?

928
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:23,290
Hey, guys, come on. Just
stay focused, okay?

929
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,421
We'll be just fine without Moose.

930
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,006
<i>Stay tuned.
Up after the break,</i>

931
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:30,930
<i>The Mob and LMNTRIX battle for their lives.</i>

932
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:38,309
<i>Keep on watching. And
do not forget to text.</i>

933
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,478
<i>Every vote counts.</i>

934
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,818
<i>Are you ready for more?</i>

935
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,438
<i>I know I am.</i>

936
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,069
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah.

937
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,742
<i>Do we have any fans
of The Mob out there?</i>

938
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,990
<i>What about LMNTRIX?</i>

939
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,420
This is crazy, man.

940
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,706
I never thought that me and you

941
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,132
would end up against each other.

942
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,135
Are you seriously ignoring me right
now? Because I swear to God, man...

943
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,640
Don't even worry
about it. It's not even worth it.

944
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,393
<i>Are we ready?</i>

945
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,520
<i>LMNTRIX versus The Mob.</i>

946
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,945
<i>In this corner, hailing from Miami...</i>

947
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,401
<i>The Mob!</i>

948
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:38,911
<i>And in this corner, hailing
from Los Angeles, California...</i>

949
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,038
<i>LMNTRIX!</i>

950
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,875

01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:27,898
<i>Dance.</i>

953
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,203
Round 3.

954
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,201
<i>Dance.</i>

955
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,190
- Come on. Do it.
- No.

956
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,026
No. Stop it.

957
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,610
No.

958
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,021
<i>Your votes have been tallied,</i>

959

<i>and the surprise sleeper
crew of this competition.</i>

962
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,000
<i>LMNTRIX.</i>

963
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,507
Enjoy that win, man.

964
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:52,887
<i>In this fight to win a three-year
contract here at Caesars Palace,</i>

965
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:55,398
<i>only one battle remains.</i>

966
01:13:57,141 --> 01:14:00,736
<i>A clash between LMNTRIX,</i>

967
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,779
<i>who barely made the qualifying rounds,</i>

968
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:06,075
<i>but somehow eked their way into the finals,</i>

969
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,198
<i>and the team to beat,</i>

970
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,783
<i>The Grim Knights.</i>

971
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,791
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

972
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:21,002
<i>There will be blood on the dance floor.</i>

973
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,765
Hey. Hey. Hey!

974
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,092
What happened out there?

975
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:33,018
What happened out there? Are you serious?

976
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,643
You tried to pull me into a
dangerous trick that I wasn't ready for.

977
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:36,938
We were not ready for it.

978
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,642
But we won. We made it to the final round.

979
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,068
That's all that matters?

980
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,319
Ah. I should've known better.

981
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,112
Alexxa Brava.

982
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,697
- You guys.
- Cheers.

983
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,075
<i>Next up on VH1,

984
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,456
<i>with an Alexxa Brava video marathon.</i>

985
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:00,209
<i>Sweat Sugar Dance Voodoo!</i>

986

987

990
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:13,055
- That's the guy.
- That's The Grim Knights guy.

991
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,135
What guy?

992
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,516
That <i>ass</i> clown Jasper.

993
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,974
I knew I'd seen that
damn face before. I knew it.

994
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,933
Oh, my God, is he wearing a sparkle thong?

995
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,816
He looks like a dead baby.

996
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,022
Wait till Sean hears about this.

997
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,524
Oh. Where's Sean and Andie?

998
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,155
I don't know, but she was
super pissed after the battle.

999
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:31,702
I don't know.
Her knee's been bothering her.

1000
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,120
She might be icing it. I don't know.

1001
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,540
Wait, ice. We need ice.
We gotta keep these babies chilled.

1002
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:37,867
Where's the bucket?

1003
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,170
I think Monster use it to soak his foot.

1004
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:42,334
Ew!

1005
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,413
Come on, man.

1006
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,628
That's nasty.

1007
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,004
- Blisters.
- You're nasty, bro.

1008
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,380
Dancers, blisters. I do a lotta footwork.

1009
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,461
Hey, Andie.

1010
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,546
- Hey. There she is.
- There she is.

1011
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:53,423
Damn, gangster.

1012
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,594
I think I go get ice, too.

1013
01:15:56,385 --> 01:16:00,481
All right. Okay, fill it up.
I'll fill that back up.

1014
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:01,773
What was up with Andie?

1015
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:04,068
Something happened to her.
I don't know. She's really upset.

1016
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,736
You're being so paranoid.

1017
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:08,030
You said it
was gonna be The Mob.

1018
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,985
Relax. It was a last-minute
creative decision.

1019
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,911
LMNTRIX really brought it last night,

1020
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,988
so we changed up the plan a little.

1021
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:18,657
Hmm.

1022
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,959
You guys duking it out

1023
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,254
is gonna make for a much
more compelling storyline.

1024
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,081
Yo, just don't
make a fool outta me.

1025
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:28,213
Don't worry, baby, it's in the bag.

1026
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,215
This is gonna be some killer TV.

1027
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:31,928
What?

1028
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,084
You don't trust me?

1029
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,382
- Shh.
- You know I do.

1030
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,426
Oh. You do?

1031
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:37,556
Yeah.

1032
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:41,060
Then shut that

1033
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:45,314
pouty little mouth of yours.

1034
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:58,660
Holy balls.

1035
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,993
We just saw Jasper and Alexxa
mackin' on each other in the hallway.

1036
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,203
What? You sure?

1037
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,788
Who else dress like a zebra?

1038
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,123
That's not even the worst part.

1039
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,834
We heard them talking,
and this whole Vortex thing is scripted.

1040
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,802
It's been planned.

1041
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,630
She said it was gonna be
killer TV when we all went down.

1042
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,465
So they had it rigged from the beginning?

1043
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:17,596
We never had a chance?

1044
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,219
The Grim Knights were always gonna win.

1045
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,430
No, but America vote for us.

1046
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,393
Maybe they just thought
they were voting for us.

1047
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,271
I don't believe this.

1048
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,227
Connect the dots, sister.

1049
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,312
Jasper was her backup dancer.

1050
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,114
Now he's her private dancer.

1051
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,907
Jasper was her backup dancer?

1052
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,318
Yeah. We just saw him on TV

1053
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:39,576
shaking his nasty ass
in Alexxa Brava's video.

1054
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:40,952
We gotta tell someone.

1055
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:45,002
Who we gonna tell?
The producers? They're in on it, too.

1056
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:48,581
Of course it's rigged.
It's reality TV. Nothing's real.

1057
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,792
I can't go back to the sucky phone job.

1058
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,128
What about us?
We spin those stupid sign for living.

1059
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,837
Man, this sucks.

1060
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,638
For a second, I thought we had a shot.

1061
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,477
Hard to go back to our old lives now, huh?

1062
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:03,975
Okay, hang on.
We're still going out there, okay?

1063
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,226
We've worked so hard.

1064
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:06,307
This is gonna be an opportunity

1065
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,063
for us to just go out there and...

1066
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:09,644
What's the point'? Huh?

1067
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,445
We're not gonna win this thing.
And I'm not going out there

1068
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,238
and humiliating myself
in front of the whole world.

1069
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:17,490
The point is that we're an
awesome crew and amazing dancers.

1070
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,536
So, we're gonna go out
there and still show them what we've got.

1071
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,455
This isn't about winning some contest

1072
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,407
or some silly little prize.

1073
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,330
This was about booking a job.

1074
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,127
Everyone in this room is sick of

1075
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:28,921
scraping around to pay their rent.

1076
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:32,333
I live in a freakin' little storage closet.

1077
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,920
This was about
all our hard work finally paying off,

1078
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:38,631
so we can have some actual stability.

1079
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,472
It was far more than that for me.

1080
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,589
Camille?

1081
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,379
You home?

1082
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:26,205
I knew I'd find you up here.

1083
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,461
Look, I know that you're probably, like,

1084
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:35,085
super uber galactically
pissed at me right now,

1085
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,383
but I'm really sorry.
And I don't know how I let that happen.

1086
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:45,679
Seeing you and that girl,

1087
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,510
I wasn't just jealous of her,

1088
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:51,180
but also of you.

1089
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:57,191
You were just having the best time,

1090
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,772
and I didn't belong.

1091
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:03,401
I couldn't get out of there fast enough.

1092
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,737
It felt gross.

1093
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,947
I just wanted to come home.

1094
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,955
But home doesn't feel
like home without you.

1095
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,080
Does this feel like home to you?

1096
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:19,842
Are you kidding me?

1097
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,135
I love my life with you,

1098
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,839
and I wouldn't trade it for
anything else in the world.

1099
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:28,847
But being in the spotlight,
that's a big part of who you are,

1100
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:31,395
and I feel like I'm holding you back.

1101
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:34,265
I found the person
I wanna dance with, all right?

1102
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:38,686
Yeah, we have jobs
and, yeah, we have a nice apartment,

1103
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:41,397
but, I mean, we're more than that.

1104
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,653
Can't we have it both ways?

1105
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:45,363
Yeah.

1106
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:47,490
That's what you want?

1107
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:49,245
Yeah.

1108
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:51,787
Are you sure?

1109
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:04,131
I'm sure.

1110
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:12,386
Sean!

1111
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,855
Sean. Come. Eat and drink with us. Yes?

1112
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:18,438
This is so good. I'm going
to eat the whole thing, I don't care.

1113
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:20,019
- No worries.
- So good.

1114
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,775
She love it here, Sean.

1115
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:24,027
- We're moving here.
- Mmm.

1116
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,867
Oh. You have to try this. So good.

1117
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,620
So, you guys didn't take off with Moose.

1118
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,950
Mooski, he knows what's important.
He doesn't need us.

1119
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,126
And we would never miss finale.

1120
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,623
What time tomorrow you dance, huh?

1121
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:38,912
We're not.

1122
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,299
Whole contest is rigged.

1123
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,006
This whole thing was just a waste of time.

1124
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,260
The Mob hates me. Andie hates me.

1125
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:52,135
Viva Las Vegas, everybody.

1126
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:57,097
So you give up?

1127
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:00,392
Yeah.

1128
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:04,067
Better to quit now.
That's okay. We go back, you clean toilets.

1129
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:05,898
I think the one in the back is clogged, no?

1130
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:09,235
Take it easy on him.
Can't you see his heart is broken?

1131
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,573
You remember how we feel,
European Championship?

1132
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:15,704
That one.

1133
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:17,667
Sean...

1134
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:20,830
European Championship Dance Final.

1135
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,382
I step on her foot.

1136
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:26,169
I break her foot.

1137
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,337
Boom. We lose.

1138
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:32,633
I feel terrible, but she forgive me.

1139
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,059
I'm not perfect.

1140
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,641
Who is perfect?

1141
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,732
Where is perfect?

1142
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,484
Sheep poop, remember?

1143
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,488
Sean,

1144
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:56,286
sometime you just have
to shovel through it. That's all.

1145
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,084
Yes, you have problems.

1146
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,962
You think winning is all there is to life?

1147
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:06,421
Is this the only reason you work so hard

1148
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,630
and give up so much to be here?

1149
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,422
You know what you need to do.

1150
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,629
You do it.

1151
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:05,434
Wait, wait, wait.

1152
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:14,989
I'm sorry.

1153
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,160
I thought I could fix everything.

1154
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:26,376
I thought I could figure
everything out, but...

1155
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:29,425
Okay, stop, stop, stop, dude.

1156
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,878
You look absolutely
ridiculous when you cry.

1157
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,714
Sorry. I just really
need a friend right now.

1158
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:38,471
Look, man, you're my best friend.

1159
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,644
You're family. Families fight. It's cool.

1160
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,393
You've been there for me
when I was at my worst and,

1161
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:48,064
from the looks of it, you could
probably use someone in your corner.

1162
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,897
But first you gotta come and
apologize to the rest of the family

1163
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,527
'cause they still hate your guts.

1164
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,321
Come on. Get in here.

1165
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,111
Don't you dare tell 'em I cried.

1166
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:58,537
You look crazy when you cry.

1167
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:00,364
I know. I didn't cry, all right?

1168
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:09,206
Hey.

1169
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:12,338
Hold up.

1170
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,216
Yo, please. I've got a plan, okay?

1171
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,807
We can't go down like this, guys.

1172
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:19,883
Look...

1173
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:21,976
Where's Andie?

1174
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:23,178
She took off already.

1175
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:24,971
You said we were all going home,

1176
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:26,898
and she didn't wanna ride in the van with

1177
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:28,266
everybody.

1178
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:30,060
Yeah.

1179
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:34,694
Listen, drop your bags, please,

1180
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:37,276
and meet me in the basement
in 10 minutes, okay'?

1181
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:49,037
<i>Hey. It's Andie.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

1182
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:51,999
Hey. It's me.

1183
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:56,592
Me and the crew have a plan
and we really need you.

1184
01:26:57,003 --> 01:27:00,223
So, if you get this message in time,

1185
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:01,390
we'll be in the basement.

1186
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,066
Thanks for coming, guys.

1187
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,283
This all started out so simple.

1188
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:20,110
I love dancing.

1189
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,536
But everyone here knows
that it's not that easy

1190
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:27,413
when you're trying to
make a living out of it.

1191
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,953
Every day is a battle,

1192
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:33,711
and we work so hard just
to be unappreciated by some pop artist

1193
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,339
or win some little competition

1194
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:37,590
that everyone's gonna forget about

1195
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,262
in a couple months.

1196
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,721
The thing is,

1197
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,599
I wanted to win so bad that

1198
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:50,603
I didn't realize what I was losing.

1199
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:54,978
Our lifestyle isn't that easy.

1200
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,527
But it's the one we chose.

1201
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:01,201
So I say we choose to make the best of it.

1202
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:03,741
Tonight.

1203
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:08,914
Not for the show,
for the people watching, but for us.

1204
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,505
This is what matters. And I see that now.

1205
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:15,419
Nice.

1206
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:20,758
I thought you were gone.

1207
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:23,174
Well, I'm back.

1208
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,517
LMNTRIX is dancing, so am I.

1209
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,560
I'm not letting my crew down.

1210
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:28,683
Thanks for coming in.

1211
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,309
I'm not doing this for you.

1212
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,900
So, you guys wanna do this?

1213
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,147
Somebody got the music?

1214
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,274
Yeah.

1215
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,276
What, you thought I'd let you guys down?

1216
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,574
Moose!

1217
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,158
And we're back!

1218
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,034
We started this thing, right?
Let's finish it.

1219
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:46,618
Yo. Hold up.
You're not going anywhere without us.

1220
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:48,239
Yo.

1221
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,080
Thanks for coming, man.

1222
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,285
Really?

1223
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,797
Everybody, this is my family.

1224
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:59,168
New family, meet the old family.

1225
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,463
Y'all get along, okay?

1226
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,130
Yo.

1227
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,966
Okay. Let's try.

1228
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,559
- What's up, man?
- Nice to meet you.

1229
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:11,563
All right, so, guys, what's the plan?

1230
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,392
They rigged this thing?

1231
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,607
We'll give 'em a taste
of their own medicine.

1232
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:20,856
We bring the fuckin' house down.

1233
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:34,791
Good evening, children of The Vortex.

1234
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,675
We are at Caesars Palace tonight,

1235
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:46,552
and we are ready to settle the score.

1236
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:51,846
One team will leave here
the champions of The Vortex,

1237
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:54,306
with a three-year Vegas contract.

1238
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,687
And one team will just

1239
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,276
leave.

1240
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:06,277
Remember to text your votes.
And be merciless.

1241
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:09,488
And now,

1242
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,949
the moment we've all been waiting for.

1243
01:30:12,032 --> 01:30:16,208
The Grim Knights versus LMNTRIX.

1244
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:39,392
Whoo!

1245
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,035
Come on.

1246
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:02,669
Come on. Come on.

1247
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:06,710
Let's go.

1248
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,594
You want some of me?
You want some? Let's go!

1249
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:21,373
Y'all know what it is! Let's go!
Grim Knights!

1250
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:26,377
Weren't The Grim Knights amazing?

1251
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,006
So hot.

1252
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:34,503
They're gonna be very hard to beat.

1253
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:36,884
Next up, LMNTRIX.

1254
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:46,139
Thank you. Thank you.

1255
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:49,943
I just wanna say how much we've
enjoyed being a part of this contest.

1256
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:55,148
And, uh, it's been a life-changing ride.

1257
01:34:56,065 --> 01:35:00,320
And to be going up against
The Grim Knights. What an honor.

1258
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:02,656
And what a compelling storyline.

1259
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:06,167
It's gonna make for some killer TV.

1260
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:12,507
You know, I came here to win, but
I'm okay if that doesn't happen.

1261
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:15,210
Tomorrow, we might be back to our day jobs.

1262
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:19,139
But tonight, we're living
the dream together!

1263
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:24,186
Because I'm up here on this
stage with the best dancers...

1264
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,512
No.

1265
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:28,306
The best of friends.

1266
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:34,605
And a phenomenal woman

1267
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:38,362
who's taught me what really matters.

1268
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:46,242
So what do you say we all just
forget about this winning or losing,

1269
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:47,325
and just enjoy the show?

1270
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:04,220
Yeah!

1271
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:09,426
Is that fire?

1272
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:11,102
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1273
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:17,201
What the hell's goin' on?

1274
01:39:17,326 --> 01:39:19,920
Yo, I don't know. This is some horseshit.

1275
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:21,748
The Mob can't dance. This is cheating.

1276
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:22,957
I know.

1277
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:10,087
Ah-ha!

1278
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,858
Yo, this is crazy.

1279
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:32,159
I know!

1280
01:42:48,954 --> 01:42:49,955
Hey.

1281
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,217
Let's do it.

1282
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:54,635
Let's do the move.

1283
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:55,757
Yeah?

1284
01:42:56,629 --> 01:42:57,801
You better catch me.

1285
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:58,972
Trust me.

1286
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:12,937
Oh!

1287
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:04,530
What?

1288
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:08,163
But I haven't even tallied the votes yet.

1289
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:11,291
Did you see the stuff on the chandeliers?

1290
01:44:14,457 --> 01:44:15,674
I understand.

1291
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:18,173
Yes.

1292
01:44:18,669 --> 01:44:21,468
This crew will make
a fabulous show at the hotel.

1293
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:22,798
Mmm-hmm.

1294
01:44:24,175 --> 01:44:25,267
They got the show?

1295
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:26,594
Yes, they got the show.

1296
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:29,521
Go pack my bags. I need a week in Cancun.

1297
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:31,941
What just happened?
LMNTRIX just won?

1298
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:23,360
<i>Like I said, the life
of</i> a <i>dancer is not easy.</i>

1299
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:25,820
<i>But sometimes everything lines up.</i>

1300
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:27,576
<i>The world is in sync,</i>

1301
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:32,035
<i>and for one perfect moment
you feel totally alive.</i>

1302
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,417
B mark!

1303
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:27,552
One, and two, and...

1304
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:29,351
One, and two, and three,
and four, and five.

1305
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:32,766
- You have a tag here.
- Oops.

1306
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:42,400
There it is!

1307
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:44,607
A mark!

1308
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:46,483
Pot sticker?

1309
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:29,993
Just shut that pouty little mouth.

1310
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:32,826
Yeah.

1311
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,327
Pot sticker?

1312
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:35,407
Spring roll!

1313
01:47:37,117 --> 01:47:38,790
Egg roll!
One more time. Here we go.

1314
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:40,542
Egg roll, right?

1315
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:43,711
I'm going to shove my mane in your mouth.

1316
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:46,881
Bite it! Bite it! Bite it!

1317
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:52,307
One more time.
Ready, and...

1318
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:56,220
Put me down. Put me down. Put me down.

1319
01:47:57,388 --> 01:47:58,605
You gotta trust me.

1320
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:00,641
I'm sorry, that was a bit
weird at the end for me.

1321
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:04,069
You gotta...

1322
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:43,350
Bye, guys.

1323
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:05,213
How long do you want me to hold this?

1324
01:49:06,305 --> 01:50:06,939
