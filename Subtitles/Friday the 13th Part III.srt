Oh my, God. Please help me!

Oh, God...

4
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,916
Jason! It's all done, Jason.

5
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,380
You've done your job well,
and Mommy is pleased.

6
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,173
That's a good boy.

7
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,095
Now, come to Mommy. Come on.

8
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,891
Come on.

9
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,438
Mommy has a reward for you.

10
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:45,289
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

11
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,879
Come on.

12
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,507
That's my boy. Come.

13
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,259
Kneel down.

14
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,638
That's a boy.

15
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,433
Kneel down.

16
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,144
Kneel down, Jason.

17
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,481
That's my good boy.

18
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,780
That's a good boy.

19
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,617
Good, Jason.

20
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,965
Ginny!

21
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,667
Come on. Let's go. Ginny.

22
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,389
Jesus.

23
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,933
Come on.

24
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,131
God damn it, Harold! I spent all day
yesterday washing your clothes.

25
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,885
Look what you're doing to them!
You know I work very hard around here

26
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,804
trying to keep up with you

27

Just take what's yours

55
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,030
Very considerate.

56
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,534
Could've at least finished the job.

57
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,245
Do I have to do everything around here?

Harold?

Okay, boys, soup's on.

What's the matter, Lionel?
Aren't you hungry? Come on, it's good.

Here, look. I'm eating.

62

It is good.

63

Dayfly eggs?

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Come on. If Edna catches you in here,
she'll make a fur coat out of you.

Come on, I'll take you home.

67
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,782
Didn't I feed you enough for supper?

68
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,368
The doctor said you have to lose weight,
now didn't he?

69
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,120
You know, I'm trying to help you,

70
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,039
but you just keep sneaking food
behind my back.

71

What am I gonna do with you?

72
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,504
And would you put that filthy animal
back where it belongs? Come on.

73
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,693
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
so nervous about? Come on.

74
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,417
Who would do something like this?

75

What's the matter? What happened?

76

79
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,327
<i>Thank you, Johnny, and good</i>

<i>That's not the end.</i>

87
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,042
Harold?

88

It's the white house on the left.

-Shelly, come and meet your date.
-Bring her to me!

90
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,807
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

91
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,438
Sex, sex, sex. You guys
are getting boring, you know that?

92
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,315
What would a weekend
in the country be without sex?

93
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,360
-Cool it, Andy.
-I didn't mean it that way.

94
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,280
Look, you guys, I want you
to have a good time this weekend.

95
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,158
What happened to me at the lake
happened a long time ago.

96
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,827
I'm fine, really, okay?
Just forget about me.

97
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,080
I'm supposed to forget
that we've been friends...

98
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,876
God damn it, Shelly! Why do you
always have to be such an asshole?

99
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,921
I beg your pardon.
I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor.

100
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,631
Same thing.

101
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,680
Look, Shelly, you're my roommate,
and I like you. Most of the time.

102
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,141
But you've gotta quit doing those things.

103
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,852
Now, I got you a date, didn't I? Didn't I?

104
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,354
-Yeah.
-So don't embarrass me.

105
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,774
Just relax. Be yourself.

106
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,319
Would you be yourself
if you looked like this?

107
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,327
-Yes?
-Hi, Mrs Sanchez. I'm Chris.

108
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,704
We've come to pick up Vera.

109
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,706
She is not going!

110
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,923
-What are they saying?
-I don't know. I flunked Spanish.

111
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,509
Hi, everybody. What are you looking at?

112
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,552
Is everything all right?

113
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,971
Just your basic
old-fashioned mother problems.

114
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,682
So which one's my date?

115
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,850
Hi.

116
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,187
You're Shelly?

117
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,814
Sorry.

118
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,941
Hey, the van's on fire!

119
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,719
Is that all you two are gonna do
this weekend? Smoke dope?

120
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,389
Why not, man? Is there a law against it?

121
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,516
There are better things to do
with your life.

122
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,103
-Like what?
-I can't think of anything.

123
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,064
Hey, Chrissy.
How much further to the lake?

124
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,233
We would've been there already
if some people

125
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,485
didn't have to go to the bathroom
every five minutes.

126
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,238
That's what happens
when you're pregnant.

127
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,990
Sure, why not?

128
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,578
Hey! Let's share the wealth with those
less fortunate up front here.

129
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,415
Yeah.

130
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,296
-What do you got in there?
-My whole world.

131
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,759
-In that little thing?
-Stick around. You'll see.

132
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,598
-It's the cops.
-Oh, my God!

133
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,892
-What?
-They're catching us.

134
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,311
-What are we gonna do?
-Destroy the evidence! Hurry!

135
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,355
-No way, man.
-Let's go, Chuck! Come on!

136
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,107
-They're gaining on us.
-Throw it out!

137
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,444
-No, they'll see it.
-We gotta get rid of it. Eat it.

138
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,863
The cops are gonna get us.
We're going to jail!

139
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,406
-I'm driving.
-Breakfast?

140
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,408
No way! We're pregnant, remember?

141
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,160
Faster! Eat faster!

142
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:08,331
-Why don't you help us?
-I guess I'm just not hungry.

143
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,209
You're always hungry, Shelly.
Come on, eat!

144
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,003
-I'm allergic to pot.
-I gotta pull over.

145
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,678
-Oh, man!
-Oh, no!

146
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,014
Shit!

147
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,655
<i>Charlie 63 is unable to handle...</i>

148
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,116
Help out the ambulance.
I'll get the crowd.

149
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,534
Okay, you guys, show's over.

150
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,496
Let's move it back over here, all right?
Come on, you guys.

151
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,516
Hey, kiddo. Don't let your imagination
run away with you.

152
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,698
-Chris, stop the van. Stop!
-What is it?

153
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,787
-What are you doing?
-You almost ran over him!

154
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,331
I must have been daydreaming.
I didn't even see him.

155
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,835
Hey, he looks just like my grandfather.

156
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,044
Why,

157
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,007
I must be in heaven!

158
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,051
Don't touch him.
You don't know where he's been.

159
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,555
-Thank you.
-Sleeping in the middle of the road?

160
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,684
You are, indeed, all of you,
kind and generous young people.

161
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:57,148
Look upon what his grace
has brought unto me!

162
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,984
-What is that?
-I found this today.

163
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,070
-There were other parts of the body.
-That's an eyeball!

164
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,575
And he said that he wanted me
to have this. This.

165
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,954
He wanted me to warn you!
Look upon this omen

166
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,666
and go back from whence ye came!

167
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,086
I have warned thee!

168
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,798
I have warned thee.

169
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,433
Check it out!

170
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,468
Why don't we take our bags
into the house first.

171
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,220
Chris, come on down.

172
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:13,808
You go ahead. I'm gonna take my bags
in the house first and look around.

173
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,153
Don't you dare! I'm not ready!

174
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,499
Hello?

175
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,423
Is someone here?

176
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,806
Rick!

177
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,351
Is it my imagination
or did itjust get cold in here?

178
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,441
Did I do something wrong? Did I?

179
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,112
No. It's just being here again.

180
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,701
I know it's only been two years,
but I feel like I've been away forever.

181
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,745
Doesn't look like
anything's changed, though.

182
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,707
Even the paintings are still crooked.

183
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:24,044
Well, you've certainly changed.
Don't you even say hello any more?

184
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,546
I'm sorry.

185
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,010
-Hello, Rick. How are you?
-Well, that's a start.

186
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,637
Could you just slow down, please?

187
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,432
There's a whole weekend ahead of us.
Let me get to know you again.

188
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,392
Let me get to know this place again.

189
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,979
Okay. But there's only
so many cold showers I can take.

190
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,484
Come outside
and help me with the bags.

191
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,572
Oh, God!

192
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,409
You know, Chris, I think you've gained
some weight since last summer.

193
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:59,246
I have not! You creep. Put me down.

194
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,334
Here, you get the ones inside.
I'll get the ones off the top.

195
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,963
Wasn't this door closed
a few minutes ago?

196
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,091
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

197
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,683
Chris...

198
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,895
That's my bag. I'll take care of it.

199
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,730
Shelly, what are you doing in there?

200
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,899
Why aren't you down at the lake
with everybody else?

201
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,569
They said
they were going skinny-dipping.

202
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,780
And I'm not skinny enough.

203
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,494
This was my bedroom.
It's yours for the weekend.

204
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,204
Great.

205
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:54,301
Chris? I don't mean to be picky
or anything, but where's the bed?

206
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,805
Chris?

207
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,144
It's right here.

208
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,066
-What's this?
-It's your bed.

209
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,486
-A hammock?
-You might like it.

210
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,490
Why not?

211
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,167
Where's the bed?

212
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,462
All right.

213
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:35,009
Chris, I don't understand
why you guys have so much hay.

214
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,052
You don't even have any horses.
You never did.

215
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,348
It's my father's idea. Every year,
he makes plans to buy a horse

216
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:46,312
and every year, he buys all this hay
but no horse. You figure it out.

217
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:50,983
You realise, of course,
that I gave up an opportunity

218
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,194
to spend the weekend
with Mary Jo Conrad for this.

219
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,530
You mean you actually
gave up the chance

220
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,492
to be with the Mary Jo Conrad
for little old me?

221
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,494
That's right.

222
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,288
Boy, are you dumb.

223
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,626
Okay, Chris, I realise
I'm just a dumb country boy

224
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,170
and my feelings really don't matter.

225
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:15,257
But this is the sweat of a worker
on my forehead, not of a lover.

226
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,384
Now, I believe

227
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,557
that there is a time
and a place for everything.

228
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:29,229
And now's the time and now's the place,
if you know what I mean.

229
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,523
So, what I think we should do

230
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,902
is set aside three hours a day
to fulfil our needs.

231
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,280
One in the morning and two at night.

232
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,368
If you agree, I agree.

233
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,745
Were you talking to me?

234
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,927
-Is anyone in here?
-What's going on?

235
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,347
You check down here.
I'll check the upstairs.

236
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,037
Is anybody in there?

237
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,495
Don't look at him.
Let's just get the hell out of here.

238
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,873
-We heard screaming.
-Oh, my God!

239
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,541
-What happened to him?
-Is he dead?

240
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,335
-Don't touch him, Andy!
-Don't move him!

241
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,546
You creep! Get up!

242
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,841
I guess I fooled you?

243
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,551
-You jerk!
-Chris, leave him alone.

244
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,596
-He doesn't know any better.
-It was a joke!

245
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,182
-Chris.
-It was just a joke.

246
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,145
-I didn't mean to...
-You never mean to.

247
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,606
I gotta get out of here.
I'm going to the store.

248
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,900
-Can I use your car?
-Oh, sure.

249
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,777
Thanks.

250
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,945
Asshole!

251
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,833
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, let me go with you!

252
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,377
I gotta get out of here too.

253
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,733
Chris. Chris, wait up.

254
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,109
What's wrong?

255
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,863
It's that creep, Shelly.
What a sick sense of humour.

256
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,324
Oh, that's just his way
of getting attention.

257
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,743
He doesn't know what happened.

258
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,995
I know it, Deb.

259
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,750
But from the minute we got here, I've
been seeing things and hearing things.

260
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,128
It's probably just my imagination.

261
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,130
I shouldn't have
come back here so soon.

262
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:46,802
Don't let it get to you.
Relax. Enjoy the weekend.

263
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,763
Nothing's gonna happen to you
when we're all here together.

264
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,431
Okay.

265
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,018
-Hey. How are things with Rick going?
-Okay.

266
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,605
But he just doesn't understand.

267
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,776
That'll be $18.50.

268
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,196
We don't accept no food stamps.

269
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,949
Shelly!

270
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,619
I need some money.

271
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:25,132
Excuse me,
but I believe that's my wallet.

272
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,096
Make a wish.

273
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,016
Can I buy you two guys a beer
or something?

274
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,521
I'll take that now.

275
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,024
Is this your rubber?

276
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,484
Didn't your mama teach you manners?

277
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,154
If you want something, you ask.

278
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,657
-Nice.
-Please, be cool.

279
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,162
May I please have the wallet?

280
00:31:55,246 --> 00:32:00,083
You mean,
"May I please have the wallet, ma'am?"

281
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,840
May I please have the wallet, ma'am?

282
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:12,095
That's good. That's real nice.

283
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,529
Hey, that was a 20!

284
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,949
-Are they following us?
-No!

285
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,701
-Good.
-Here. You drive.

286
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,996
The way I feel right now,
I'd probably get us into an accident.

287
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:42,542
Next time, I'll know how to handle
a situation like that.

288
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,629
Let's just hope next time isn't too soon.

289
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,407
Oh, shit!

290
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,410
"Oh, shit" is right. Let's get out of here.

291
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,580
Hold on!

292
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,698
-What are you doing?
-He went too far this time.

293
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,539
Oh, shit!

294
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,131
-I did it. I did it. I did it! Did I do it?
-Yes, you did it.

295
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,467
-You were great.
-I was great.

296
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,262
You son of a bitch! You ought to
come back here, you bastard!

297
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,557
You ain't getting away with this!
God damn it! I'm gonna get you!

298
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,019
What do you say
we go get some exercise?

299
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,480
This is all the exercise I need.

300
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,152
That was close.

301
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,990
Hey, you better watch out
with that thing.

302
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,663
Come on. I'm warning you, Andy.
I'll break your string.

303
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,640
I wonder what happened to them.

304
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,767
What happened
to your windshield, man?

305
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:08,271
We had a slight misunderstanding
with a motorcycle gang.

306
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:12,442
Yeah, but Shelly made them see the
error of their ways. Didn't you, Shell?

307
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,194
It was nothing.

308
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,199
My poor car. What did you do to it?

309
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,537
Yeah, well, we're real sorry, you know?
But it wasn't our fault.

310
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,706
A few minor repairs,
it'll be good as new.

311
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,210
That's it. I've had it.

312
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,672
I thought it would be a good idea
for us to spend some time together,

313
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,966
but this is a little more
than I bargained for.

314
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,801
Where are you going?

315
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,469
Away from here.

316
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,472
Stay with me.

317
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,726
-Why should I?
-Because I want you to.

318
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,731
You don't play fair, do you? Get in.

319
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,963
-Hey. Let's go for a swim.
-I don't know.

320
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:19,843
Come on. We'll be all alone.
We can do whatever we want.

321
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,763
-Nobody'll see.
-Sounds disgusting. Let's go.

322
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,309
I'll grab a couple of towels.
I'll see you down there.

323
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,818
-Maybe we shouldn't do this, Ali.
-We gotta even the score, don't we?

324
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,654
Nobody's gonna get hurt, okay, baby?

325
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,572
-Right.
-Trust me.

326
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,037
-Let me do it.
-I know what I'm doing.

327
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,156
Oh, shit.

328
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,805
Who's up there?

329
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,407
Here, take this in the barn
and start pouring. And find Fox.

330
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:30,343
What the hell are you doing?
Get off that thing.

331
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,848
This feels good!

332
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,893
Ali is gonna be pissed,
he sees you screwing around.

333
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,688
Now, come on. We got shit to do.

334
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,027
What the hell?

335
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,040
Fox?

336
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,212
Where are you?

337
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,596
Stop screwing around.

338
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,641
You're messing everything up!

339
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,567
You're dead now, woman.

340
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,236
Fox.

341
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,630
Fox. Loco.

342
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,675
Open the damn door.

343
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,136
Fox.

344
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,662
What the hell are you guys doing
up there? You hear me talking to you?

345
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,514
Fox!

346
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,025
When I find you, you bastard,
you're a dead man!

347
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,778
Shit!

348
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,130
-I don't wanna go home. This is fun.
-I know.

349
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,178
-What are you doing?
-We haven't been in the barn...

350
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,555
We haven't been in the barn yet.
Let's take a look.

351
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,390
Not now. I'm cold.

352
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,062
Come on, Debbie,
how about a little roll in the hay?

353
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,398
Go play with yourself.
I'm going into the house.

354
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,740
Hey, wait up!

355
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,086
-Is that better?
-Yeah. Thanks.

356
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,590
You know, I don't think
I could live anywhere else.

357
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,760
The nights are always
so peaceful and quiet here.

358
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,763
-It's deceiving.
-What do you mean?

359
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,432
The quiet can fool you. It fooled me.

360
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,650
Chris, why'd you come back here?

361
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,986
To prove something to myself.

362
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,949
To prove I'm stronger than I think I am.

363
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,617
What about us?

364
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,288
I'm here with you.
Can't that be enough for now?

365
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,333
I don't know. I mean,
I don't see you for months on end.

366
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:17,046
Then when I do, you put this barrier up
between us. How do I break through?

367
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,227
-You give up?
-You out of your mind?

368
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,817
-Do you give up?
-Never.

369
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,156
I know how to stop this.

370
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:50,037
Andy? I can think of much better things
for you to be doing with your hands.

371
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,750
You win.

372
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,773
I guess that leaves you and me. Sort of.

373
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,357
Yep.

374
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,111
You really are very good at that.

375
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,696
It's nothing.

376
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:31,037
Vera, you and I have gotten to know
each other a little today, you know?

377
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,872
And I like you.

378
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:38,419
I like you a lot. I was thinking
that maybe, you know, we could...

379
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:43,299
I don't think so. Look, I'm gonna go
outside for a few minutes.

380
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:46,469
And then when I get back in,
we'll talk, okay?

381
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,099
Sure. We'll talk.

382
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,895
Bitch.

383
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,502
-How do we do it?
-Well, first we take our clothes off

384
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:05,214
and then you get on top of me,
or I could get on top of you.

385
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:09,135
I know how to do it. I mean,
how do we do it in the hammock?

386
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:15,808
Well, I think you can
figure something out.

387
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,729
I'll think of something.

388
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,987
You're right.

389
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,657
I should have told you everything
a long time ago, but I couldn't.

390
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,993
Look, Chris, you don't have to
if you don't want to.

391
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:38,331
I want to. I want you to know
what happened so you'll understand.

392
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:46,839
Everything is so clear in my mind,
as if it were happening right now.

393
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,346
I don't know if you remember,

394
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,642
but when you dropped me off
that night, it was very late.

395
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,270
I knew my parents would be waiting
for me, but I didn't care.

396
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,356
We had such a good time.

397
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,610
The minute I walked in the door,
my parents started yelling at me

398
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,278
and cursing me.

399
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,532
We had such a big fight.

400
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,370
My mom slapped me.

401
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:23,209
That was the first time my mother
had ever hit me. I couldn't believe it.

402
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,796
I ran out the door and into the woods.

403
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,134
I wanted to punish them.
So I decided to hide out all night.

404
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,722
I thought I'd get them so worried
that they'd be sorry for what they did.

405
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,727
It had been raining
and the woods were cold and wet,

406
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,982
but I found a dry spot
under an old oak tree.

407
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,985
I guess I fell asleep.

408
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,575
All I can remember next

409
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,747
is being startled out of sleep
by the sound of footsteps.

410
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:07,128
I was sure it was Dad,
so I just sat up and I listened for him.

411
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,506
But the footsteps stopped.

412
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,013
Then there was
this cracking noise behind me.

413
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,350
I turned around,

414
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,856
and standing there
was this hideous-looking man.

415
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,485
He was so grotesque,
he was almost inhuman.

416
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,114
He had a knife.

417
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,658
And he attacked me with it.

418
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,830
I was so hysterical, I don't know
how I was even able to think,

419
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:47,668
but I kicked the knife
out of his hands and I ran.

420
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:53,966
But he ran after me and he caught me
and he pulled me down on the ground.

421
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,721
I was kicking and screaming
and yelling, but it didn't do any good.

422
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,308
He dragged me along the ground.

423
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,313
I blacked out.

424
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,817
I don't know what happened after that.
I just don't know.

425
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,989
Chris? It's all right. You're all right.

426
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,418
When I woke up, I was in my own bed.

427
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,923
My parents have never said
a word about it.

428
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:39,011
They act as if the whole thing
never happened, but it did.

429
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,350
All I want is to just forget it, but I can't.

430
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,521
I'll never forget that horrible face, never!

431
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,358
What's that?

432
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,695
Damn it, it's that battery.

433
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,533
I charged it yesterday.
Must not have taken.

434
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,285
It may just start anyway. Let me try.

435
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,546
We're gonna have to walk back.
It's okay.

436
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,716
-Okay?
-Yeah.

437
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,470
I know a pretty good shortcut.

438
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,935
Shelly?

439
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,638
Heavy shit!

440
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,981
Who's there?

441
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,408
Shelly, if this is
another one of your tricks...

442
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,179
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you
like that.

443
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,808
Between you and Shelly, I'm lucky
I haven't had a heart attack already.

444
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,351
What's butterball up to now?

445
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:35,562
I don't know.
He just ducked into the barn.

446
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,023
Come on, let's give him
some of his own medicine.

447
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,414
I don't think he's in here. Let's go back.

448
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,222
Maybe that wasn't him.

449
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,057
Chili.

450
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,571
Are you crazy?

451
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:49,470
-I guess he must've left.
-Come on, let's get out of here.

452
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,601
I'm not going to let anybody hurt you.

453
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,729
Gee, thanks. I feel a lot better now.

454
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,052
That'll teach you a valuable lesson:

455
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:34,807
A beautiful girl like you
should never go out in the dark alone.

456
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,060
Damn it, Shelly!

457
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,271
Why do you do these stupid things?

458
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:45,025
-I have to.
-No, you don't have to.

459
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:49,321
-I just want you to like me.
-I do like you.

460
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:52,032
But not when you act like a jerk.

461
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:55,577
Being a jerk
is better than being a nothing.

462
00:56:55,662 --> 00:57:00,833
-I never said you were nothing.
-You don't have to say it. I could tell.

463
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,170
You're wrong. Shelly!

464
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,115
Chuck? Chili?

465
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,203
Hey. What are you guys doing in there?

466
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,437
Are you guys doing something
I shouldn't see?

467
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,107
That's great.

468
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,103
Hey, I dropped your wallet.

469
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,690
I'm sorry. I got it.

470
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,695
Who are you?

471
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,198
What are you doing?

472
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,494
Hey, now cut that out right now.
That's not funny.

473
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,622
That was the best one yet.

474
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,418
Was it you, me or the hammock?

475
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,756
-I vote for me.
-I vote for the hammock.

476
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,720
Where you going?

477
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,099
I'm taking a shower.
You ought to try it sometime.

478
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:40,028
-Hey, Debbie, can you hear me?
-Barely.

479
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,573
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get a brew. You want one?

480
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:58,964
Andy?

481
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,474
Oh, Jesus.

482
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,562
-Do you want a beer or not?
-Sure.

483
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,981
-All right. Be right back.
-Okay.

484
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,659
Andy.

485
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,807
-Andy!
-Yeah?

486
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,851
Are you still out there?

487
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,356
I can't hear you.

488
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,401
Andy?

489
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,071
Will you quit fooling around?

490
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,701
Cut it out.

491
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:43,693
Andy? I changed my mind.
I don't want that beer.

492
01:03:45,613 --> 01:04:15,642
Andy?

493
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,609
Andy? Did you hear me about that beer?

494
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,154
Andy!

495
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:32,409
Oh, God,
I hate when you don't answer me.

496
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,776
What?

497
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,281
Where's this coming from?

498
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,372
Great shortcut, Rick.

499
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,503
-Come on, let's move it.
-Always spoiling my fun.

500
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,797
-What was that noise?
-What?

501
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,634
I don't know.
I heard something over there.

502
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,677
Come on, let's get home.

503
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,819
-Did I hear you screaming?
-No.

504
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,656
It's probably Debbie having an orgasm.

505
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,908
How come you never scream
when we have sex?

506
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,577
Give me something to scream about.

507
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:02,123
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I was just practising.

508
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,084
Don't do that to me!

509
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,837
Here. Go down the cellar
and check the fuse box.

510
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,217
In the dark? Alone?

511
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,885
Be a man, man.

512
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:41,287
Nothing to be afraid of, man.
So, what if it's dark?

513
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,752
Nothing to be afraid of.

514
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:16,990
Jeez!

515
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,578
Oh, God.

516
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,420
All right.

517
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,640
Who's there?

518
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,146
Chuck, you back already?

519
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:55,195
Well, at least you got
the outside lights working.

520
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,655
Nice makeup job.

521
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:03,036
Stop fooling around, man.

522
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,134
That's better.

523
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,529
What's going on?

524
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,280
Get up!

525
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:42,117
Shelly, enough is enough!

526
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:47,831
Oh, my God!

527
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,544
Andy? Debbie?

528
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,880
Shelly's dead!

529
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,717
He's dead!

530
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,723
Andy! Deb...

531
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,517
No!

532
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,313
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

533
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,932
This wind sure came up.

534
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,565
Seems awfully quiet.

535
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,612
It's hard to believe
the wild bunch is already in bed.

536
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,281
Yeah, well, who knows with those guys?

537
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,883
I can't get this door open.
There's something behind it.

538
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:25,887
-Oh, I smell something burning.
-Here, take this. Let me do it.

539
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:31,726
No wonder. Some idiot put this chair
there. Something is burning.

540
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,646
Lights aren't working either.

541
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:38,399
Oh, real smart. What's going on here?

542
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,652
You tell me. They're your friends.

543
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,404
I'm gonna go out to the living room
and check what's going on there.

544
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,656
Okay.

545
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,164
Andy, Debbie, are you guys up there?

546
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,961
Anybody here?

547
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,349
Everybody else has taken off and left us.

548
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:13,601
-They wouldn't do that.
-I don't know what's going on,

549
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,854
but I'm gonna go outside
and take a look around.

550
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:18,523
Rick, wait. I wanna come with you.

551
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:27,365
Andy? Is that you?

552
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:42,213
Rick?

553
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,889
Is everything all right?

554
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,764
Where's that coming from?

555
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:45,443
I don't know what kind of game
you guys are playing, but I don't like it.

556
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:53,618
Debbie? You guys up here?

557
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,295
Hey, come on, you guys.
You're wrecking the house.

558
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:43,918
Rick!

559
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,325
Rick! Where are you?

560
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:06,501
Rick! Help me!

561
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:26,187
Rick!

562
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:29,774
Rick! Rick!

563
01:15:35,405 --> 01:18:10,935
No!

564
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,826
Keys. Keys!

565
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,122
Come on!

566
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:52,036
What's happening?

567
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:59,043
No!

568
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,590
Come on. Come on!

569
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,020
Gas.

570
01:26:03,366 --> 01:26:05,409
You can't be alive.

571
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:08,203
You!

572
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:21,300
You psycho!

573
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:19,311
No!

574
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:23,273
No! No! No!

575
01:29:27,987 --> 01:29:29,112
No!

576
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:31,174
Looks like she's the only one left alive.

577
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,176
What was all that
about a lady in the lake?

578
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,720
She must've flipped out.
That poor kid's been through hell.

579
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,848
All of her friends...

580
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:39,516
I'll take her.

581
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:10,130
It's okay. You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be fine.

582
01:31:11,305 --> 01:32:11,184
