2
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,226
What is the supernatural? Anyone?

3
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,905
Like ghosts or spirits or devils?

4
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,815
Those are examples.

5
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,202
Actions or events
which we cannot explain through science.

6
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,361
Good.

7
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,729
Before the discovery
of a pathogenic theory of medicine,

8
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,492
people believed that
sickness was caused by evil spirits.

9
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,627
A show of hands, if you get sick,

10
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,705
who here would
rather see a priest before a doctor?

11
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,459
Who here believes in God?

12
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,386
Heaven? Hell?

13
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,555
The apocalypse?

14
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,716
Ghosts?

15
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,012
Really? No one here believes in ghosts.
Interesting.

16
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,355
David Q., one of my first patients,

17
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,691
was a perfectly normal 12-year-old boy.

18
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,316
One day, that all changed.

19
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,196
<i>Who are you drawing, David?</i>

20
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,453
<i>You know.</i>

21
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,829
<i>Tell me again, to the camera.</i>

22
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,462
<i>Mr. Gregor,</i>

23
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,841
<i>the man that makes things happen.</i>

24
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,399
What if you could prove
that the supernatural was merely

25
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,407
a manifestation of what already
exists in the mind, the subconscious?

26
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,567
- What you're doing is immoral.
- Traitor.

27
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,160
That was disgusting. How dare you do that?

28
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,640
- It's not disgusting!
- You left!

29
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,533
No, don't take it personally.
Don't take it personally.

30
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,168
The onus is on the scientist
to prove himself.

31
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,207
So, where to start? With the individual.

32
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,258
You cure one patient, you cure all mankind.

33
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,678
- You have no idea.
- You don't get to have an opinion.

34
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,430
- You don't know how crazy...
- It's so bizarre.

35
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,680
Harry, will you take that for me? And this?

36
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,437
Phillip, you're welcome back anytime.

37
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,853
Let's have a chat.
I'll see you guys back at the house.

38
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,448
<i>There's not much of a budget,
everyone's working for science.</i>

39
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,283
Your job would be
to document every step of the experiment.

40
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,201
I hope you don't scare easily.

41
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,460
Do you speak?

42
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,458
Of course.

43
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,969
Tell me about yourself, Brian.

44
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,467
There's not much to tell.

45
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,305
I like cameras, that's my nature, I guess.

46
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,936
To be curious?

47
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,395
To film.

48
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,475
- And what's your passion?
- Passion?

49
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,984
Yes, what story are you looking for
with that camera of yours?

50
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,231
I don't know, everything.

51
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,152
Are you a believer?

52
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,166
My mother's religious.

53
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,332
My father's a banker, a clerk.

54
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,798
My father works in town,
my mother is at home.

55
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,461
I wonder,

56
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,346
are you avoiding my question
out of a reluctance to talk about yourself,

57
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,843
or because you're genuinely confused?

58
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,189
I suppose I don't know what I believe in yet.

59
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,778
Well, that's fair enough.

60
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,362
Well, Brian,

61
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,278
welcome to the experiment.
You are our official chronicler.

62
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,335
I work with the A.V.,
the audiovisual department.

63
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,219
But you are a student here, no?

64
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,344
No, I'd never get in here.

65
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,975
<i>So</i> how did you
get involved with the Experiment?

66
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,478
I volunteered as a subject.

67
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,059
Professor Coupland, or Joseph if you like,

68
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,977
he thought I was all wrong.

69
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,317
Not tortured enough, apparently.

70
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,826
He already had someone truly psychotic.

71
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,999
<i>I see someone.</i>

72
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,586
<i>Good, Jane. Who do you see?</i>

73
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,539
<i>Do you recognize this person?</i>

74
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,760
<i>I don't know. I'm not sure.</i>

75
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,340
<i>A girl... I see a little girl.</i>

76
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,428
<i>No,</i>

77
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,441
<i>maybe a doll.</i>

78
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,284
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

79
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,785
<i>It's okay, you're perfectly safe.</i>

80
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,209
<i>Her name is Evey. I don't like her.</i>

81
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,585
<i>The doll's name is Evey?</i>

82
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,799
<i>I just need to sleep.</i>

83
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,979
Be quiet! Calm down!
It's just the pipes, it's just the pipes!

84
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,152
Crazy fun, no?

85
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,647
Go on up.

86
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,514
It's for her own protection.

87
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,012
And ours.

88
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,647
What's wrong with her?

89
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,021
Suicidal.
She remembers nothing from her past.

90
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,864
Foster child, abandoned.
Passed from house to house.

91
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,611
Families would keep her for a bit, then,

92
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,123
you know, things would happen.

93
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,369
The furniture would move,
objects would catch on fire.

94
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,213
The authorities were
convinced she was possessed.

95
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,967
Luckily, Joseph discovered her.

96
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,845
He ruled out schizophrenia, the usual.

97
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,677
Then he measured her brain waves.

98
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,551
Frequencies off the charts, look.

99
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,056
That's why he chose her.
He took her from the asylum.

100
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,732
Well, Brian, welcome to the Experiment.

101
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,075
Don't look into her eyes,
don't say anything to her if you can help it.

102
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,582
I can't have the experiment
corrupted by outside inﬂuences.

103
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,420
I understand.

104
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,776
What?

105
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,412
Did you think
my head was going to spin off?

106
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,296
Sorry if I disturbed you.

107
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,630
- It comes and goes.
- Excuse me?

108
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,344
What's inside.

109
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:57,051
- Stop staring at my wrists.
- Sorry.

110
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,307
I promised Joseph that I wouldn't try again,

111
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,315
that I'd give him time.

112
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,649
Is there time?

113
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,153
Yeah, of course.

114
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,322
Can he cure me?

115
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm sure he can.

116
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,076
I just want to get better.

117
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,582
Tell Joseph that I'm ready.

118
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:36,014
Ask him to let me sleep. I'm begging you.

119
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,014
And, Brian,

120
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,516
thank you.

121
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,572
Seen a ghost?

122
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,664
She knew my name.

123
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,546
She probably heard us talking about you
at some point.

124
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,380
She's no fool.

125
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,427
She said to tell you

126
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,723
that she needs sleep and that she's ready.

127
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,306
Excellent, that is a good sign.

128
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,642
I really don't know if I can do this, sir.

129
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:30,478
If you think you're scared,
imagine how she feels?

130
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,899
Besides, aren't you just a little bit intrigued?

131
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,657
Hey, you! You over there!

132
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,832
Is he in? Is he in that house?

133
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,586
I am going to go mad
if this sound does not stop!

134
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,547
What's the point, exactly?

135
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,252
Remember,
"Cure one patient, we cure mankind"?

136
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,426
Jane Harper is that patient.

137
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,845
If we can push our subject
to manifest negative energy

138
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,926
in the form of telekinetic activity,

139
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:10,062
we can harvest that energy and remove it,
like extracting a tumor.

140
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,691
We cure mental illness for good.

141
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,116
Are you a skeptic, Brian?

142
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,776
Pardon?

143
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,453
Don't you think we can cure Harper?

144
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:29,620
We can't have non-believers
in this house, Brian.

145
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,797
It's a destructive energy

146
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,296
in a constructive space.

147
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,799
Not again.

148
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,643
Harry, will you turn the music off upstairs?

149
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,813
Well, thank you and good luck. I'm sorry.

150
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,934
It won't happen again.

151
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,982
You just clap.

152
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,072
Hello, Jane.
We've brought something for you.

153
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:11,499
You can put all your bad thoughts and
negative energy into the doll, Jane.

154
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,460
Get rid of them, get rid of them for good.

155
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,258
Evey doesn't look like this.

156
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,674
She's all wrong.

157
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,507
Why don't you describe her to me?

158
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,679
This doll's dead,

159
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,594
inside.

160
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,932
That's what my parents used to
say about my eyes.

161
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,981
They weren't my real parents.

162
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,401
With each new family, they'd sit me down,

163
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,699
ever so nice,

164
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,366
but I knew soon enough

165
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,366
that they'd hate me too.

166
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,953
That must have been very painful for you.

167
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,215
I scared them, all of them.

168
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,878
You're not possessed, Jane.
You're just unwell.

169
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,006
I just want to sleep,

170
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,638
forever.

171
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,690
Aren't you concerned that
Jane Harper will take her own life?

172
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,061
That's why we keep her under surveillance
and medicated.

173
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:22,573
So, why are you
working on this experiment, Harry?

174
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:23,733
Me?

175
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,073
Scientific pursuit.

176
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,162
The equipment we're using is cutting edge,
engineer's dream.

177
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,925
Help me!

178
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,262
It's 95 over 70.

179
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,108
So, how did you get into this?

180
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,566
Initially my field was abnormal psychology,

181
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,443
which, despite the frightening title,

182
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,865
merely indicates
the study of behavior outside the norm.

183
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,457
You run into a lot of charlatans,
con artists, and mental deficients,

184
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,375
Brian, and I disproved them all.

185
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,875
Then, there was David Q.

186
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,376
Harry, lights.

187
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,302
<i>Where are you, Mr. Gregor?</i>

188
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,644
I think David used
the character of Mr. Gregor

189
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,814
to explain the
telekinetic havoc his mind was wreaking.

190
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,068
The same way
Jane is mentally sculpting Evey?

191
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,736
Exactly.

192
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,736
<i>Why is Mr. Gregor
doing these things, David?</i>

193
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:54,658
<i>I don't know. Mother says he's evil.</i>

194
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,168
<i>What do you think he is?</i>

195
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,163
<i>He's bad. So am I!</i>

196
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,337
<i>Mr. Gregor is make-believe!
Your mind is creating him.</i>

197
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,505
<i>You can get rid of him. I can help you!</i>

198
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,817
Mr. Gregor was
a character from a bedtime story

199
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,936
David's father used to tell him.

200
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,946
His parents must feel so guilty.

201
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,024
What happened to David Q.?

202
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,529
He was improving with my help,
but his mother,

203
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,661
a religious woman, terminated the sessions.

204
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,375
We lost touch.

205
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,295
I've heard he's living
a relatively normal life somewhere.

206
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,094
Hello, Joseph.

207
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,599
Gentlemen.

208
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,938
Why do I get the impression
this is about to become unpleasant?

209
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,736
We have to move Jane.

210
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,073
- What?
- Why?

211
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,404
They've pulled
the funding for the experiment.

212
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,074
Bloody cowards!

213
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,074
They're dead already anyway.

214
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,080
Krissi, Harry...

215
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,047
You can leave the experiment
or see this through.

216
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,921
Either way I'll understand.

217
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,505
No, we're with you, Joseph.

218
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:34,973
All the way.

219
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,265
Cameraman, I'm not well off.

220
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,232
I won't have much left for film.

221
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,568
I'll use cheaper stock.

222
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,274
After all, I'm starting to be a bit intrigued.

223
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,245
It's for the best. Come on, let's pack.

224
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,402
Do you like it?

225
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,197
If it makes me better.

226
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,372
Let's get...

227
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,752
Yeah, one of all of us.

228
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,806
Okay, should we go in? I got you.

229
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,798
Just be careful.

230
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,020
EMF scanner.

231
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,867
And there's one in each corner
and one on the table. Five in total.

232
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:44,330
Basically, they pick up minute changes
in electromagnetic energy fields.

233
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,829
I borrowed them
from the Engineering Department.

234
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,999
<i>So</i> if we can connect
Harper's mental activity,

235
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,339
which is recorded on the EEG machine,

236
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,262
to telekinetic events, then...

237
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,720
So if Evey's made of negative energy,

238
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,767
then this should help us identify...

239
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,233
Very good, Brian, very good.

240
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,026
- Are we ready?
- Yeah.

241
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,281
Here we go.

242
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,578
We just want to ask Evey some questions.

243
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,457
Come on, Evey. Come out.

244
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,797
Come play with us.

245
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,966
One knock for yes, two for no.

246
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,477
God, please, Evey.

247
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,816
Why won't she speak to us?

248
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,271
Damn it, Jane!

249
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,864
I'm trying, Joseph.

250
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,201
Try harder.

251
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,330
So, how do we assess our progress?

252
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,671
How do I assess our progress?

253
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:21,048
Patience and courage.
Evey will slowly come to life.

254
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,797
If we survive, we win a Nobel Prize.

255
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,008
Wait, is there a chance we won't?

256
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,560
- Win?
- Survive.

257
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,432
There's always a chance.

258
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:35,854
"Security is a superstition.
It does not exist in nature.

259
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,649
"Life's either a daring adventure
or nothing."

260
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,316
- Einstein?
- Helen Keller.

261
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,287
Mate, just put it in the bottom corner.
Have you got it?

262
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,825
To brighten things.

263
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,033
Thank you.

264
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,875
You feeling okay?

265
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,994
I'm a disappointment.

266
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,626
I'm taking too long.

267
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,133
I have to find Evey.

268
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,171
<i>Slowly...</i>

269
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,263
<i>Go down into the darkness.</i>

270
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,021
Allow the total relaxation you're feeling

271
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,267
to plunge you through any mental chaos.

272
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,853
Deeper.

273
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,649
Ready.

274
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,034
Deeper.

275
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,161
She's in alpha wave state.

276
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,077
How are you feeling?

277
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,333
<i>Lost, alone...</i>

278
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,751
But you're not alone, are you?

279
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,512
Peer into the darkness.

280
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:16,435
There's something there with you,
isn't there? What is it?

281
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,270
Say it, "I'm not alone."

282
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,769
- I am alone.
- Say it!

283
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,364
I'm a failure. Everyone hates me.

284
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,029
I want to die.

285
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,920
Jane, if you're not going to try
you can go back to the chemical...

286
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,210
- Jesus.
- What was that?

287
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,545
The EMF, sensor two.

288
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,708
Something knocked the camera
out of my hand! I had a firm grip on it.

289
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,129
Oh, my God, it happened.

290
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,470
Evey was here? Why didn't you tell us?

291
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,717
She was playing.

292
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,640
Bring her back.

293
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,978
Jane, bring her back.

294
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:13,033
We made progress tonight.
A toast. Brian, you make it.

295
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,778
- I don't know...
- Be quick with it now. No thinking.

296
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,493
- Come on.
- To Jane.

297
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,536
To Jane!

298
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,543
- I think he's falling in love.
- My, my.

299
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,454
He'll be bringing her flowers next.

300
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,176
Harry.

301
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,603
Brian, she's had her sleep. Keep her up.

302
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,318
I love you.

303
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:53,782
Now why would you need to ruin the mood
with that filthy, filthy word?

304
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,694
- Good night, Brian.
- Good night.

305
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,524
Bed broke.

306
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,066
- Sorry about that.
- I'm not.

307
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,488
Good night, Brian.

308
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,948
You look tired. Why don't you go to bed.

309
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,780
I'll take over.

310
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,891
Harry.

311
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,273
Come see this.

312
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,278
Can you see her?

313
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,693
Krissi. Krissi!

314
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,699
I need the lights.

315
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,121
- Is that enough?
- Yeah, yeah, perfect.

316
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,679
Now you feel better, don't you?

317
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,684
May we see her, Jane?

318
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,482
She's pretty-

319
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,479
So, why are you doing this to her?

320
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,445
Is Evey losing her hair? Is she sick?

321
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,488
Is she someone you hated?

322
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,366
Did she hurt you when you were little?

323
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,710
Jane, please try to remember.

324
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:59,002
Hey, stop it, stop it!

325
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,140
You must let us help you. Okay?

326
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,437
Help me? God, no.

327
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,689
No one can help me.

328
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,688
They act like I'm invisible.

329
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,903
Do you want to see me disappear?

330
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,234
Sure. Weak pulse.

331
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,324
Brian, look at this.

332
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,909
- You see that?
- What is that?

333
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,170
Looks like she's been scratching something.

334
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,062
Jane, Jane! Harry!

335
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,848
Jane, Jane!

336
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,854
Come on, Krissi, come on, get up. Come on!

337
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,861
- What is with you?
- Do you want to meet Evey?

338
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,897
- What?
- She's inside me right now.

339
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,776
- Jane.
- Take me.

340
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,203
- Jane!
- She's inside me.

341
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,993
- Feel Evey. You can even touch her.
- What are you doing?

342
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,456
Stop! Stop!

343
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,950
- Let him go.
- Coward.

344
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,215
Take your hands
out of his trousers now, please.

345
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,464
Thank you.

346
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,943
I'm sorry. It wasn't what it looked like.

347
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,186
I know.

348
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:47,943
I don't understand what's going on.

349
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:52,031
It's obvious.
She's aware of your feelings for her,

350
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,584
which could be very dangerous for you.

351
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,744
<i>Coward.</i>

352
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,501
Better go.

353
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,252
<i>Coward!</i>

354
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,441
It's a job.

355
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,361
You can quit anytime.
She's not your responsibility.

356
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,900
Come on.

357
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,384
She's here.

358
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,513
EMF hit, sensors one through five.

359
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,892
Like you to let us talk to Evey.
Will you do that?

360
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,807
One knock for yes, two for no.

361
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,560
EMF sensor five.

362
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,561
- It's so hot.
- She's right there, guys.

363
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,314
There's a fire.

364
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,945
No, no, there's no fire. You're perfectly safe.

365
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,906
Krissi, pass me a candle.

366
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,079
Here you are.

367
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,828
Is Evey afraid of fire?

368
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,715
Joseph...

369
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,894
Stop! Stop!

370
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,598
Cameraman, you've scared her off!

371
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:23,856
We've lost it.

372
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,400
Do that again and you are gone.

373
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,447
Hello?

374
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,123
It's open.

375
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,470
Jane?

376
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,394
Jane?

377
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,678
Jane? Jane?

378
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,678
What's that? What have you done?

379
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,433
Krissi! Hurry, Krissi!

380
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,520
I don't know. She's lost three more pounds.

381
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,984
She's painting her body with blood.

382
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:45,402
She's mutilating herself.
I'm sorry, she must see a doctor.

383
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,996
- Do you always do this?
- Do what?

384
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,503
Retreat when you're
on the brink of something meaningful.

385
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,456
I don't know,
I've never thought about it like that...

386
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,967
There's so much you can accomplish.

387
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,527
Evey and I could be friends.

388
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,080
I think I must have
always been naked as a child,

389
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,496
my clothes always off.

390
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,755
Do I look like a woman to you?

391
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,426
Every time I look in the mirror
I see a little girl.

392
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,926
I want to see a woman.

393
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,430
Are you shy?

394
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,601
Don't you want to touch me?

395
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,439
Let me get you out of here.

396
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,115
And go where?

397
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,070
Another asylum? More doctors?

398
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,786
There must be something else
we can do for you other than this.

399
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,705
- This?
- The Experiment.

400
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,295
You know I can't leave.

401
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,794
Why not?

402
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,591
Joseph would be upset.

403
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,803
You shouldn't worry about him.

404
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,141
He rescued me. He saved me.

405
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,601
From myself and the likes of you.

406
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,770
Camera operators?

407
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,101
Men.

408
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,648
Silly, frustrated, violent men,

409
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:51,119
who want to touch you,
but can't or won't, so they torment you.

410
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,661
Not your body,
but your heart and your feelings.

411
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,835
And they set you on fire to watch you burn.

412
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,455
Is Joseph that kind of man?

413
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,749
Are you?

414
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,645
Double it. We're on the verge.

415
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,232
- Here you go, Jane.
- No.

416
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,110
Are you sure?

417
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,542
Krissi. Harry.

418
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,202
Harry.

419
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,204
Brian.

420
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,336
- You want me to...
- Yes.

421
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:47,667
<i>Okay-</i>

422
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,722
You said there was a fire.

423
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,360
There are flames,

424
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,405
everywhere.

425
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,747
The roof, the walls...

426
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,498
It's so hot.

427
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,586
<i>So</i> hot.

428
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,256
<i>So</i> hot.

429
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,174
Eve)!-

430
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,761
Evey, it's burning!

431
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,101
What do you see, Jane?

432
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,517
Tell us.

433
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,273
We can't get out. We're locked in.

434
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:53,733
Who?

435
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,619
Who's locked in?

436
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:02,788
Burning...

437
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,875
Burning, burning...

438
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:14,713
Burning! Burning! Burning, Evey!

439
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,557
Ice, Krissi, ice!

440
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,979
- She needs a doctor.
- No, no doctor.

441
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,556
Krissi, she needs...

442
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,144
No doctor.

443
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,650
I have ice!

444
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,820
- Jane!
- Oh, my God!

445
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,281
Did we get it on film?

446
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:42,957
I think I got it, whatever it is.

447
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:47,291
- And what do we think it was?
- Some friggin' exorcist shit.

448
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,789
It's what you always said.

449
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,170
She manifested her negative energy.

450
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,252
Whatever it was, it scared the hell out of me.

451
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,635
You're scared
because you can't explain what you've seen.

452
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:02,515
<i>So</i> your mind falls back
on the stories that scared you as a child.

453
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,679
Evil spirits and such.

454
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,147
How do you explain it?

455
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,187
I'd call it "teleplasm."

456
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,944
That was teleplasm? Bloody hell.

457
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:15,152
The next step is transference.

458
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,326
Once Jane's psychic energy
has found a new home,

459
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,696
we isolate it and get rid of it for good.

460
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,863
What, now?

461
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,538
The psychic floodgates have opened
and we are driving through.

462
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,544
She's hurt, tired.

463
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,836
She needs rest and food.

464
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,717
Even God rested on the seventh day.

465
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,386
Interesting.

466
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,881
Krissi?

467
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:44,557
Well, obviously, I want to go on, Joseph,
but

468
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,180
maybe she's earned a rest.

469
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,228
<i>- Harry'?
- Yeah.</i>

470
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,069
Well, it's unanimous.

471
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,320
Let's give our subject a well-deserved break.

472
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,530
Come and play.

473
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,042
You got to get him out first.

474
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,243
You ready?

475
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,582
- Yes, that's how it's really done.
- That was pathetic.

476
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,092
Cut that. Cut that out.

477
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,572
We need to speak with Evey.

478
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,458
She can come and stay right here.

479
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,953
Right here inside this doll.

480
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,875
It can be hers and
she can stay there anytime she wants.

481
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,382
I can't find her.

482
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,143
Where are you hiding tonight, Evey?

483
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,141
She's not hiding. She's lost.

484
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,144
She doesn't sound lost.

485
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,980
Are you going to come down and talk to us?
We want to meet you.

486
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,815
- God.
- Stay down!

487
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,316
Joseph...

488
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,838
Tell her to come in, Jane.
We just want to talk to her.

489
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,629
Tell her to come in and play with us.

490
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:42,637
- Play nice.
- She's here.

491
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,312
How big you've grown, little girl.

492
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,525
Big enough to walk.
If you're big enough to walk

493
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,028
you're big enough to talk. Speak to us!

494
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,032
Please, we just want to be friends.

495
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,487
She knows you're lying.

496
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,035
What can we do to calm you down?

497
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,333
- Where's she gone?
- I don't know.

498
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,332
Evey!

499
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,671
Come on. Come on.

500
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,680
Brian, get out of the way!

501
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,485
If you're her friend, you must leave her be!
Let Jane heal.

502
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,323
- Tell her, Jane.
- Leave, Evey, please.

503
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,742
- Say it like you mean it!
- Please, Evey!

504
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,417
Have you got something to show us?

505
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,259
Joseph. Joseph.

506
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:21,860
It bit me!

507
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,859
- Evey's gone, she's gone!
- Are you okay?

508
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,614
It bit me!

509
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,541
<i>Burning! Burning! Burning, Evey!</i>

510
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,292
<i>God, Jesus Christ!</i>

511
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,260
<i>She needs a doctor!</i>

512
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,996
What happens to Jane
now that Evey refuses to leave?

513
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,323
Maybe we burn down the house.

514
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:19,623
Maybe that's what Harper's been
talking about. Kill Evey.

515
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,998
And it'll be a wrap. Good ending.
Yeah, very dramatic.

516
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,257
I'm sorry,

517
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,004
are you insinuating that
we're making this whole thing up?

518
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,802
That this is somehow staged?

519
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:36,811
Professor hires gullible local cameraman
to make himself famous.

520
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:42,103
Don't be absurd. What about Jane's burns?

521
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,318
A bit of acid on the doll, basic chemistry.

522
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,191
I did go to school.

523
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,449
What about the electromagnetic
field readings, the heartbeat?

524
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,026
It's simple enough to fake.

525
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,281
And the bite?

526
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,364
Self-inflicted when we weren't looking.
And the knocks...

527
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,161
Evey? Evey, are you there?

528
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,047
<i>So</i> you break up something under the table,
a metal supported leg.

529
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,549
"Telekinetic event."

530
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,294
<i>So</i> what you're saying is that
Joseph is a fraud,

531
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,135
and Harry and I are fools, idiots.

532
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:17,138
No, I'm saying this isn't gonna
hold up as scientific proof.

533
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,474
And in the process,
we've tortured a human being,

534
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,227
for no other reason
than her sick desire to please him.

535
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,317
<i>What are you doing?</i>

536
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,907
Yes, the doll. We saw smoke.

537
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:35,449
They can say it's a fake,
that we hid something in here.

538
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,244
Oh, my God!

539
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,241
Jane?

540
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,912
- Jane. Oh, God.
- Jane. Oh, my God.

541
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,880
She faking this too?

542
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,928
I understand this has been difficult.

543
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,728
It's human nature
to question and be skeptical.

544
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:07,272
I'm sorry.

545
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,193
I didn't mean to cause...

546
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,239
We're depending on you, Brian.

547
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,953
We need every detail.

548
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,036
I'm okay now.

549
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,206
Here you go.

550
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:32,918
It's okay.

551
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,796
She will need your strength
for what lies ahead.

552
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,717
- What's that?
- Isolate Evey.

553
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,053
Turn her off.

554
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,027
Hold still, just a few more seconds.

555
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,134
Please try not to move.

556
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,020
Focus your eyes at the ceiling, okay?

557
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:38,026
Stay relaxed. Stay still, that's important.

558
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:42,872
- She's ready.
- Find Evey.

559
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,231
Don't move. Two,

560
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,517
three.

561
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:22,449
Photographs, Soviet technology.

562
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,415
Captures the bio-electric energy fields
around living organisms.

563
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,585
- Their aura?
- Their bio-electric energy fields.

564
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,088
These are Jane in a neutral state of mind.

565
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:41,255
These, when she's starting to manifest.

566
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,270
Eve)!-

567
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,773
It's ghastly.

568
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,027
So is this proof?

569
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,861
Using technology that exists, cameraman,

570
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,946
it's the best we can do.

571
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,162
See what you've made, Jane?

572
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:20,469
You made her. You can get rid of her.

573
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,465
I don't want to get rid of her.

574
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,635
You can't possibly mean that.

575
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:31,726
You can't.

576
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,479
Joseph.

577
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,236
It's okay.

578
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,736
He cares about us.

579
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:47,905
He does.

580
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,583
Joseph, I'm scared.

581
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,829
It means you're alive.

582
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,669
You'll be safe with someone else,
another family.

583
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:01,676
And I'll be sane.

584
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,345
I'm not fond of feeling scared.

585
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,773
Usually, I scare people.

586
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,571
I want to feel good.

587
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,951
Not tonight, Krissi.

588
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,836
We have to conserve our energy.

589
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,631
Go back to bed.

590
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,046
Go on.

591
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:43,937
What's wrong?

592
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,607
Nothing.

593
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,486
You've been distant all week,
something's up.

594
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:55,540
I just feel like we're living on a spaceship.

595
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,704
There's no TV, the phones don't work.

596
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,848
I've stopped going to lectures,
I haven't read a newspaper in...

597
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:05,584
It's a prison.

598
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,927
It's a prison and we are her prisoners.

599
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,429
This has gone on long enough.

600
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,010
What, you mean you and me?

601
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,892
No, you idiot! The Experiment.

602
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,273
Are both of you blind?

603
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:23,523
Joseph is in love with Jane Harper.

604
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,523
He's wants to cure her so he can have her.

605
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,858
Don't be a child!

606
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,655
Piss off.

607
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,238
Krissi!

608
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,919
I had nothing to do with this, I swear.
I was asleep.

609
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,176
You couldn't have been asleep.
That's impossible.

610
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,719
- She heard you laugh.
- I don't control Evey.

611
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:50,887
You made Evey.

612
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:55,058
This is where your grand hypothesis
meets reality, Joseph.

613
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:59,522
What's the bloody plan?
Do you even have one?

614
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,270
The plan's what it's always been.
Cure Jane Harper.

615
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,484
She tried to kill me!

616
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:09,482
Your tart tried to kill me.

617
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:13,403
Jesus, Joseph.
Are you screwing both of them?

618
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,783
Is that part of the Experiment?

619
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,866
You can go to hell, all of you.

620
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,327
Harry, go help her.

621
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,134
So, why couldn't she have been sleeping?

622
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:34,719
Because that would mean
she could manifest whilst unconscious.

623
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,263
And that is, well,

624
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:43,766
unexpected.

625
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,693
I'm sorry, Harry.

626
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,790
You're all in love with her, you know?

627
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,749
You, Joseph and Brian... Brian most of all.

628
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,872
Come on, Krissi. Get real.

629
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,625
You all think you can save her.

630
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,062
Power's out, just checked the fuse box.

631
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:33,156
- Brian! Brian!
- Sir?

632
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:35,409
Bring the light. Jane's missing.

633
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,410
- What?
- Come on!

634
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:40,990
Where's she gone?

635
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,997
She's missing. If I knew the answer to that,

636
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,710
she wouldn't be missing, would she?

637
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:56,838
What's that?

638
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,883
Help me!

639
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,520
- Jane!
- Jane!

640
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,855
Jane, where are you?

641
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,603
Jane?

642
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,948
Jane!

643
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,534
Open the door!

644
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,717
Be careful.

645
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,565
Krissi, go on. Slowly.

646
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,482
We don't know what's in here.

647
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:54,525
Sir, sir.

648
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,231
Jane?

649
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:58,942
Jane?

650
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,328
Shine the light, goddamn it. I can't see.

651
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,866
- Jane?
- Jane!

652
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,198
Jane.

653
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,001
Jane.

654
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,179
- Where is she?
- Jane.

655
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,428
Odd, there's a toy. What? Who's is it?

656
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:31,187
It's like the painting,
on the wall in Jane's room.

657
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,277
- You okay?
- Goddamn it!

658
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,034
- Oh, God, Joseph.
- It's pitch black in here!

659
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,235
<i>Semi -</i>

660
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,196
Jane!

661
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:51,124
- God, what is this?
- Jane? Jane?

662
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,832
Oh, my God, she's not here.
Can we please get out of here?

663
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:57,584
Go on.

664
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,841
Jesus! It's okay, it's okay, I'm sorry.

665
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,013
- We need to stick together!
- I'm sorry.

666
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,135
Oh, God!

667
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,729
- Jane, please.
- Jane!

668
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:15,644
We understand this has been difficult,
but we're your family now!

669
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,564
What's that?

670
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,533
What are you doing? Why are the lights off?

671
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,703
Where's Evey?

672
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:36,947
- What was that?
- What's that?

673
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,255
- It's coming from there.
- What was that?

674
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,466
She's right in front of you.

675
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,148
What's wrong, darling?

676
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:02,153
- Why are you upset?
- Get in close, go on.

677
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,158
You don't want to leave this house?

678
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,532
I understand.

679
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,707
Do you need me to hold you?

680
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,335
It's okay, love, I'm here.

681
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,376
Don't be afraid.

682
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,878
What's going on? Jane, Jane!

683
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,131
Put it out! Put it out quickly!

684
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,259
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- What is that?

685
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,020
What was that?

686
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,907
- It's a sigil.
- A what?

687
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,735
A sigil.

688
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,363
A sign of devil worship.

689
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,543
Which one of you idiots
put this into her mind?

690
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,005
Will you please just consider the possibility

691
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:00,874
that Jane didn't create Evey?

692
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,544
Okay, that maybe Evey came from...

693
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,053
Somewhere else?

694
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,257
What came from somewhere else,

695
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,059
is the idea of the fucking occult

696
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,438
to a patient who is highly suggestible!

697
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,766
So, I ask you again,

698
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,319
which one of you was it?

699
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,523
What if it didn't come from any of us?

700
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:29,157
What if she's just a vessel or a conduit?

701
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,325
She needs to go to the hospital.

702
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:34,578
Try to control your hysteria, Kristina,
it's beneath you.

703
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,251
- She's just expressing what she thinks...
- No one's asking you, Harry!

704
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,251
Don't talk to us like we're children.
We are colleagues.

705
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,128
Then think before you speak, colleague.

706
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,377
With each paranormal event,
we learn more about how to eradicate it!

707
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:50,511
To probe like scientists, not school girls.

708
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,850
That is so incredibly sexist.

709
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,145
Perhaps it doesn't
fit our hypothesis exactly.

710
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,222
Well, <i>not</i> if <i>she's possessed, it doesn't!</i>

711
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:58,557
I can't be.

712
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,190
We made her, didn't we, Joseph?

713
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,116
And we can purge her.

714
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,784
You believe that with all your heart,
don't you?

715
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,577
We can stop this experiment right now
if you wish to.

716
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:19,786
No.

717
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,047
I don't want to hear another word
of this superstitious

718
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,587
nonsense uttered in this house again.

719
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,926
If any of you are too frightened,

720
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,099
well, you can leave.

721
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:36,349
I am too frightened.

722
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,765
We should go back to Oxford.

723
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,087
Salvage what's left of the term.

724
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:43,476
What about Jane?

725
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:45,899
I'm sorry.

726
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,865
We gave her a break, now we need one.

727
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,582
Have you seen this sigil before?

728
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,957
Does it mean anything to you?

729
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,751
I can't remember.

730
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,795
Try, Jane, it's important.

731
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,385
Before I came here,

732
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,763
I was never comfortable with who I was.

733
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,480
Have you ever felt like that?

734
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,323
You ever heard someone call out your name,

735
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,238
but you couldn't recognize it <i>as</i> your own?

736
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:34,153
Or looked at old photographs of yourself,
but you couldn't recognize your face?

737
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:39,033
I felt like that for as long as I can remember.

738
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:47,920
Don't lose faith in Joseph,

739
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,425
or in Evey.

740
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:53,929
Or in me.

741
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,926
We need you.

742
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,769
For the first time in my life,

743
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,238
I think there's finally
a way for me to be happy.

744
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:14,526
Evey's making that happen.

745
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,447
- We can't.
- Why not?

746
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,167
<i>- Not yet.
- Brian'?</i>

747
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:24,790
Not until you're well.

748
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:40,181
Do you think
Evey will ever leave Jane Harper alone?

749
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,644
Whatever Evey is.

750
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,767
Screw Evey.

751
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,000
Jane.

752
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,711
Jane.

753
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,845
I need to leave.

754
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:29,061
I'll be back <i>as</i> soon as I can. Alright?

755
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,733
- Do you understand?
- Does she understand what?

756
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,735
I have to go to the film lab, get more stock.

757
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,109
It might take me a while.

758
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:46,950
<i>Okay-</i>

759
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:50,954
Take your time.

760
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:32,783
You.

761
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:36,788
You're the guy with the camera
working for Joseph Coupland.

762
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:44,129
Listen to you, nothing to say
just like everyone in Joseph's inner circle.

763
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:47,640
Tell me, have you already been
indoctrinated by the quiet ones?

764
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,430
You must have killed her by now.

765
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:53,646
You know, killing a young woman
is a wonderful way to create a ghost.

766
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,881
Harry! It's hot!

767
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:57,845
Harry!

768
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,063
Krissi!

769
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:18,867
She needs to be locked up in an asylum!

770
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,170
Sedated around the clock! Right?

771
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:25,332
When you leave a haunted house,
the spirit isn't meant to follow you.

772
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,792
- Keep it rational, Harry.
- Rational?

773
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,010
- Now Evey's...
- Cameraman.

774
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,130
What took you so long?

775
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,477
They called themselves "Lilitu."

776
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:43,191
A cult, devoted to an ancient demon
worshipped by the Sumerians

777
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,568
5,000 years before Christianity.

778
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:46,856
Is this a joke?

779
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,982
- Kristine nearly lost her life...
- It's not a joke, it's Evey!

780
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:56,362
Evey?

781
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:58,831
Evey Dwyer.

782
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,709
As a child
she exhibited a gift for clairvoyance.

783
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:06,548
Their leader Dr. Heinrich Dwyer
became convinced

784
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:09,208
that Evey could reincarnate their idol.

785
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:12,212
On June 6th, 1954,

786
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:15,515
Dr. Dwyer claimed that
Evey had received a message that

787
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,559
the Lilitu should lock themselves
inside this building.

788
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:23,766
A massive fire destroyed the building
that night, killing everyone inside.

789
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,225
Sir.

790
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,061
Sir.

791
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:33,532
Everyone including Evey Dwyer,

792
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:37,404
who was born with a birthmark, a sigil.

793
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,908
Evey Dwyer for some reason is

794
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:44,251
a force that possesses Jane Harper.

795
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:45,415
Oh, my God.

796
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:49,582
Evey's gonna do to us
what she did to the Lilitu.

797
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,761
- She's a...
- A demonic spirit?

798
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,594
Evil begetting evil for the sake of evil

799
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:00,093
until the end of all times?

800
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,312
Maybe even old Beelzebub himself.

801
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,932
Do any of these seriously work for you?

802
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,435
- They all work.
- Or...

803
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,194
Or what?

804
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,272
The rational explanation.

805
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:16,071
That Jane somehow
found out about this cult.

806
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,284
When she was four?

807
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:20,283
She heard it at the breakfast table,
her parents read it in a newspaper.

808
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,114
You make anything fit into your hypothesis.

809
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,875
This only strengthens
my hypothesis actually, Harry.

810
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:28,204
When we ask Jane to go deep
she plucked the name

811
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,790
Evey Dwyer out of the deepest
recesses of her mind.

812
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:34,586
That is what she is manifesting,
that is what you call her "possession!"

813
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:38,806
God, you're the one who's possessed,
Coupland, by your own bullshit!

814
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:44,228
Who is Evey Dwyer?

815
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,391
You know about her, don't you?

816
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,812
You found out about her
or somebody told you about her.

817
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,857
But you knew about her before I found you.

818
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,993
Answer me!

819
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:00,987
Hey, hey, hey!

820
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,162
Speak, damn you!

821
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:06,875
Brian!

822
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:10,462
Don't you touch her again.

823
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,081
But you will, won't you?

824
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,505
Maybe you can screw the truth out of her.

825
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:22,182
Krissi, Harry, stay or leave, your choice.

826
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:25,519
You, cameraman or Lancelot,

827
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:27,559
or whoever the hell you think you are,

828
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,682
I want you and your gear gone tonight.

829
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:34,316
The footage handed over. Every frame.

830
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,348
What are we gonna do?

831
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,806
I'm leaving. I'm taking Jane with me.

832
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,647
- He'll never let you.
- And even if he did, what then?

833
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,192
Find her help, professional help.

834
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:20,195
What kind of help? An exorcist?

835
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:23,486
She's not staying here, not with him.

836
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:27,907
I need your help, I need your car for starters.

837
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:34,084
Do you seriously believe that
Joseph still knows what he's doing?

838
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,554
It won't make a bit of difference.

839
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:18,257
<i>- Get it out! Get it out!
- David!</i>

840
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,461
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

841
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,014
<i>Tell him to leave me alone, Daddy!</i>

842
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:12,679
<i>I'm trying to find him, Daddy.
I can't find him.</i>

843
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,686
<i>I don't want to do this anymore, Daddy.</i>

844
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,618
<i>I'm sorry, David.</i>

845
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:34,533
<i>I'm trying to help you.</i>

846
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,317
If only I had more time with him.

847
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,203
If only she...

848
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,914
- David Q. was your son.
- You deceived me!

849
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:17,706
No, Jane, try and understand.

850
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,663
I've dedicated my entire life to this.

851
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:24,045
I'm absolutely certain that I am correct.

852
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:30,173
I can cure you. Please, I'm begging you.

853
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,184
Believe in me.

854
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,775
We believed in you, Joseph.

855
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,069
You bastard!

856
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:46,112
- You lied to us.
- You used me!

857
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,071
- I gave you everything!
- Don't you touch her!

858
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:51,868
Harry, stop! Harry, Harry, Harry, stop it!

859
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,531
- Harry!
- What the fuck?

860
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:12,097
Jesus!

861
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,970
- Get out of here!
- Krissi, wait!

862
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:20,977
Krissi!

863
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,399
Harry!

864
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:30,107
Krissi!

865
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:34,112
Krissi! Krissi!

866
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,948
Krissi, open up! Krissi!

867
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:39,909
Krissi, hold on, I'm coming!

868
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,416
- Krissi!
- Krissi!

869
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:46,756
Krissi!

870
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:49,634
It's got me!

871
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,506
No, no, no!

872
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:12,862
Krissi...

873
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:39,342
Jane?

874
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,554
Jane?

875
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,894
She was the only survivor.

876
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,572
They must have
kept it out of the newspapers

877
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:55,067
so she'd have a chance at a normal life.

878
01:25:57,194 --> 01:26:00,915
They changed her name.
A family took her in.

879
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:06,082
But the past became
a bad dream that lived in Evey like a virus.

880
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:11,713
It drove her mad, she forgot everything.

881
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:26,724
You're Evey Dwyer.

882
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,106
No wonder it's never leaving me.

883
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:34,231
The truth was always
there right in front of me.

884
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,942
I was born this way.

885
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:40,620
And that's how I'll die.

886
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,285
No, don't do that, don't...

887
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,873
All my life I felt
there's something burning inside of me.

888
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,750
Just let me help you.

889
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,373
I don't deserve to live.
I killed all those people.

890
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,458
Come with me. I can help you.

891
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,969
I can't be saved!

892
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:06,555
Jane, Jane!

893
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,599
I'm not Jane!

894
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,070
You okay?

895
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:24,698
Is she out?

896
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,000
I think so.

897
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:49,522
The patient we knew as Jane Harper
was born Evey Dwyer.

898
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:53,227
As a child
she was indoctrinated into an occult group

899
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:57,022
and made to believe
she could reincarnate their idol.

900
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:02,529
The damage that wrought on her mind
was severe.

901
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,538
The patient has expressed
on numerous occasions

902
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,371
a suicidal ideation, a death wish.

903
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,747
Joseph, you're gonna kill her!

904
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:14,374
Yes. But I'm going to bring her back.

905
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,548
Ten cc's of adrenaline injected
directly into the heart should do the trick.

906
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,257
You're not gonna get away with this.

907
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:23,723
Of course I'm not gonna get away with it!
Are you insane?

908
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,218
There are two dead people in this house.

909
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,554
- Untie, just untie...
- Quiet!

910
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,522
You have a part to play in this.

911
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:35,269
You are the reason
she's going to want to come back.

912
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,523
- Jane, dear.
- Jane?

913
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,989
- Can you hear me?
- Jane!

914
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,070
Can you hear my voice?

915
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:49,409
- Joseph...
- Yes, dear, it's me.

916
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:53,037
I want you to release Evey one last time.

917
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:55,455
- Joseph, leave her alone!
- Be quiet!

918
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,546
I will take photograms
of your bio-electric activity

919
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,761
<i>as</i> Evey leaves your body forever.

920
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:04,591
We will have scientific evidence.
It'll all be documented on film.

921
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,174
Jane!

922
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:12,351
All right, here we go.

923
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:13,473
Jane!

924
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:16,526
Joseph, don't you dare.

925
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:21,031
Joseph! Joseph! Joseph!

926
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,943
Jane! Joseph!

927
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:30,657
Jane.

928
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,458
Just give her the shot, Joseph! Get up!

929
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,626
Joseph, give her the adrenaline!

930
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:44,129
Aren't you just a little bit curious?

931
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,141
Please just give her the adrenaline now.

932
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,558
- Joseph, do it!
- Not until Evey arrives.

933
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:39,601
Jane? Jane, just... What?

934
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:04,050
Jesus, Jane, come on!

935
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:10,841
Jane, Jane.

936
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:14,018
Jane, look at me. It's me.

937
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,790
- Jane.
- I'm sorry.

938
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,263
Jane. Jane.

939
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:52,682
Jane, open the door.

940
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:55,135
Jane...

941
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:56,386
Jane!

942
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,022
Jane, open the door!

943
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,195
Jane!

944
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:17,115
Open the door, Jane!

945
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,205
Jane, please don't!

946
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:21,877
Jane, talk to me!

947
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,672
Jane! Jane!

948
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:50,148
<i>There was a fire.</i>

949
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:54,911
How did they die, Brian?

950
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:58,657
It's in here.

951
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:04,162
In here.

952
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,216
- It's in here.
- It's not in there.

953
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,506
All the film's destroyed.

954
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,305
You killed them, didn't you?

955
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:27,273
Tell us what really happened.

956
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:40,202
What is that?

956
01:33:41,305 --> 01:34:41,249
