1
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,514
You're just
having a bad dream.
That's all, baby.

2
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,350
That's all it was.

3
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:03,396
Bad dreams make
you think you've seen
things that you haven't.

4
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,276
You know what I do
when I have a bad dream?

5
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,738
I close my eyes
and I think of
something nice.

6
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,199
Like being
here with you.

7
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,607
Hurry up, sweetheart.
We're gonna be late.

8
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,069
Shit.

9
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,804
Jack?

10
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,057
Did you see someone
ring my doorbell?

11
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,684
No.

12
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,728
Okay, thanks.

13
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,307
I cleaned everything
away, sweetheart.

14
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,143
Everything is exactly
the way it was before.

15
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,855
They're clean
and shiny. Look.
Look. You see?

16
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,734
Okay, all right.
Just close your eyes.

17
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,687
Well, hello, sailor.

18
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,897
Hi!

19
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,398
Permission to
come aboard?

20
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,985
Honey, hold this.

21
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,781
So sorry we couldn't make
it yesterday. Somebody
was working late again.

22
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,284
How're you doing, Sal?

23
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,869
I'm good.
How are you?

24
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,372
I'm all right.

25
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,706
Look at you.

26
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,749
Do you like it?

27
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,209
You look great.

28
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,211
Really? I just
kinda threw it on.

29
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,254
She's had outfits
laid out for a week.

30
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,924
You're such a liar.
You know my husband.

31
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,385
I don't listen
to what he says.
You know that.

32
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,304
I brought my really
good friend, Heather.
She's so nice.

33
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,015
Promise me
you'll be attentive.

34
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,395
How're you doing, man?

35
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,230
She's not
to bring anyone.

36
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:18,526
You don't like her?
Believe me, she's the best
looking of Sally's friends.

37
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,696
Which it doesn't
say much.

38
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,823
I asked you not to.

39
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,618
You're living on a boat
with an 18-year old boy
and you're saying no girls.

40
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,788
Greg, this is Heather.

41
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,792
She's a very good friend
of mine, and I just thought
you guys should meet.

42
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,252
Hi.

43
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,336
Hi.

44
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,675
Can you just excuse me
for a moment?

45
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,929
Jess. You okay?

46
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,765
I don't think so.

47
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,601
Hey. What happened?

48
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,607
Hey. What's the matter?

49
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,859
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,153
You've got nothing
to apologize for.

51
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,988
What is it?
Are you okay?

52
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,032
I'm just tired.

53
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,368
Well, listen, we don't
have to go today if
you don't want to.

54
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,455
No, we do.
I-I wanna go.

55
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,206
You sure?

56
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,712
Yeah.

57
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,922
Yeah.

58
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,842
Yeah? Okay, come on.
Come up here.

59
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,891
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

60
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,727
This is Heather,
Sally's friend.
You remember Victor.

61
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,688
So let's go sailing!

62
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,065
Okay.

63
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,744
Hey.

64
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,496
You okay?

65
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,624
Is Greg okay?

66
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,585
He's fine.
He's upstairs.

67
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,879
You've been asleep
for a couple of hours.

68
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,256
I had this terrible dream.

69
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,716
What about?

70
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,926
I don't remember.

71
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,720
I wouldn't worry.

72
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,056
Apparently bad dreams
cure you of real
life stress.

73
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,144
As indeed
does champagne.
You want some?

74
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,188
Yeah.

75
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,233
Downey, wanna give me
a hand, please?

76
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:50,446
Actually, Victor, I'm
a guest of the Captain's,
but yes, I will help you.

77
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,616
Victor, what was that
back there at the harbor?

78
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,117
What?

79
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,995
I asked Jess if
she was all right
and you said no.

80
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,581
You told me she was
bringing the little
boy along.

81
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,460
When I was walking
with her in the harbor
I asked where he was.

82
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,587
She couldn't remember.

83
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,756
She stared into space
for like 20 seconds

84
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,883
and then she said
he's at school.

85
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,052
So?

86
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,180
Well, it's Saturday.
Ain't no school today.

87
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,017
Her son goes to a special
needs school and it's
open every day.

88
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,395
Be nice to her.

89
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,648
All right.

90
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,774
All right.

91
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,109
Do you boys
sunbathe together?

92
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,820
Sometimes.

93
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:36,325
The champagne is not
great but it is cold.
Want some?

94
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,368
No thanks.

95
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,328
Okay, more for me.

96
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,664
Hey, how are you feeling?

97
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,833
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize how tired I was.

98
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,379
You apologize one more
time, and I'm gonna
throw you overboard.

99
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,841
Here.

100
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,176
You all right?

101
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,928
Yeah.

102
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,944
He thinks we're
a fishing boat.

103
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,321
He's gonna go hungry.

104
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,200
You want to steer?

105
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,743
Nah.

106
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,454
Go on.

107
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,543
Which way
do I aim?

108
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,628
You're gonna
aim that way.

109
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,966
It's easy, right?

110
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,054
So, she's a waitress
at some diner.

111
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,724
At least there
they talk. They
became friends.

112
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,892
Oh, and she has
an autistic son.

113
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,269
So they're just friends.

114
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,937
Sally!

115
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,732
What do you want me
to say? I'm sorry she
has a retarded son?

116
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,483
Yeah!

117
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,945
Well, I'm sorry.
You know, that's not
Greg's problem, that's hers.

118
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,864
What is it,
is it the shorts?

119
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,908
No! Heather, Greg's
been my friend for
a really long time.

120
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,536
I can't just sit back
and watch him get
shaken down.

121
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,121
She isn't doing that.

122
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,750
Well, I hope not
because Greg is
far too trusting.

123
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,793
I'm kinda
linking the boy.

124
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,088
Uh, no, you're not.
Can you please go up
there and talk to Greg?

125
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,133
I really think
the two of you will
be perfect for each other.

126
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,511
And I really don't like
seeing him with her.

127
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,848
Jess, are you ready?

128
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,017
Yeah, let her go.

129
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,609
Yeah.

130
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,196
Woo!

131
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,991
So, how do you
know everyone?

132
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,077
Victor, he's staying
with me for good.

133
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,287
He got in trouble
at home. He had
to get away.

134
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,831
I found him sleeping
behind the store
at the harbor.

135
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,960
You know, we got talking,
and now he lives here.

136
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,879
Just like that
you let him move in?

137
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,840
Well, I got three rooms.
I can't sleep in them all.

138
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,635
And Downey,
I've known him
since I was a kid.

139
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,471
Sally, his wife,
I know her from
high school.

140
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,099
I dated her
for like four days
in the eighth grade,

141
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,602
so technically
she's my ex.

142
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,354
They seem really nice.

143
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,483
Yeah. Except for the fact
that every year they
feel obliged

144
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,945
to bring me
an eligible girl.

145
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,239
Maybe they think
you're lonely.

146
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,324
Do I give off
lonely to you?

147
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,118
Sometimes.

148
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,913
When I come to see you
at the diner, I'm not
lonely, I'm hungry.

149
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,251
Obviously yesterday
was different.

150
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,710
What happened yesterday?

151
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,505
Yesterday I was
not hungry.

152
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,341
I came in with the sole
purpose of inviting
you sailing.

153
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,802
You did?

154
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,595
I did.

155
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,853
Turn at port side.
We're losing wind.

156
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,938
Let me check it
for just a sec.

157
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,029
So, things are
okay with Tommy?

158
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,031
The same.

159
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,867
Every day is the same.

160
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,744
Tommy likes the things
to be a certain way. Yeah.

161
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,498
If I do one thing
differently, I lose him.

162
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,212
What's the matter?
I've never seen you
like this before.

163
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,341
I don't know. I just, uh,
I just feel guilty when
I'm not with Tommy.

164
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,302
That's because
you're a good mother.

165
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,347
But you can't
be everywhere
all of the times.

166
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,975
Hey, guys. Oh!

167
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,060
How is it going?

168
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,104
We're good.

169
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:39,026
I was just wondering
if I could steal Jess
away from you.

170
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,195
Sally's dying
to talk to her.

171
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,072
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now.

172
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,200
No, no, it's okay.
I-I should circulate.

173
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,539
Hey, just for the record,

174
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,792
I'm not interested.

175
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,102
Yo, what the fuck?

176
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,648
Wind's dropped down on us.

177
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,235
It's not dropped,
it's gone.

178
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,159
This is crazy.

179
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,161
You ever seen
this before?

180
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,706
Yeah, yeah. Just not
quite so sudden.

181
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,043
Are we okay to get
home? There is no wind.

182
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,629
Yeah, yeah. We got
an engine. It's not
a problem.

183
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,216
It's just, it's weird.

184
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,176
Greg?

185
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,096
Is that normal?

186
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,457
Okay, I'm fucking
freaked, what the fuck.

187
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,312
Triangle to coast
guard. Over.

188
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,483
Triangle to coast
guard. Over.

189
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,987
Coast guard,
go ahead. Over.

190
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,575
We've just gone from seven
knots to absolute zero. You've
got anything unusual? Over?

191
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,453
Nothing showing up. Over.

192
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:59,458
It's darkening up pretty
quick out here. Looks like
an electrical storm. Over.

193
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,919
Help me. Please.
Can you hear me?

194
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,672
Help me.
Please, help me.

195
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,760
Killing everyone. They're
dead. They're all dead.

196
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:13,221
We hear you.
What's your
position? Over.

197
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,311
Distressed caller,
we hear you. What are
your coordinates? Over.

198
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:25,192
Coast guard, did you hear
a distress call? We're not
getting it anymore. Over.

199
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,113
Distressed caller,
make another transmission.
What is your position?

200
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,282
Greg?

201
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,927
Get below deck now.
Get the life jackets.

202
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,250
Cut it.
Cut the sail.

203
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,964
Vic, get the main
sail down.

204
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,007
Get it down.

205
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,848
Vic!

206
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,683
No!

207
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,323
Get back.

208
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,578
Jess, take my hand.

209
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,996
Grab on.

210
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,457
Heather!

211
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,756
Grab on.

212
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,598
Heather!

213
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,772
Vic!

214
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,718
Jess.

215
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,477
Are you okay?

216
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,145
All right.

217
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,273
Downey?

218
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,528
Are you guys okay?

219
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,155
Have you seen Heather?
She got lost through
the window.

220
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,490
No. Come on, come on.

221
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,660
Heather!

222
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,497
Heather!

223
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,960
Greg! Help me!

224
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,337
Sally. Sally.

225
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,756
Just give me
your hand.

226
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,842
Heather!

227
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,746
Are you guys okay?

228
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,206
Yeah.

229
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,382
Are you all right?

230
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,679
Tommy's at school, yeah?

231
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,893
He'll be looked after
until we get back.
He'll be all right.

232
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,895
Thank God. Yo!
Help us!

233
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:16,733
Help us. Help.
Help us. Over here.

234
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,569
Oh, God.

235
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,696
Hey. Hey.

236
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,617
Wait. Come on,
over here!

237
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,411
There, there. Over there.
I can see someone.

238
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,498
Yo, we need some
help down here.

239
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,460
Help us, please!

240
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,296
Hello. We need
some help down here.

241
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,049
Yeah, he's seen us.
He's seen us.

242
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,844
Oh, thank God.

243
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,813
Jump, jump, jump.

244
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,776
Okay. Jess,
come on, come on.

245
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,237
Jess. Come on.

246
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,447
Come on, come on,
take my hand. Okay.

247
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,659
Okay. You okay?

248
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,220
You okay? Yeah?

249
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,225
Hey.

250
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,519
How is it?

251
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,189
See? I told you.

252
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,525
Hello?

253
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,500
Hello?

254
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,420
Hello!

255
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,926
Do we wait?

256
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,595
No, let's go
to the bridge.

257
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,473
We'll get the captain
to put a call out to
the coast guard.

258
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,224
We'll get a search
for Heather.

259
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,439
Come on.

260
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,902
Do you think Heather
would've made it
on board?

261
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,028
Honey.

262
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,780
There's a chance,
isn't there?

263
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,783
Yeah. Yeah,
there's a chance.

264
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,103
Hello?

265
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,232
Hello?

266
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,288
Hello!

267
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,920
Somebody please help us?

268
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,466
Hello?

269
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,731
Where the fuck
is everybody?

270
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,318
You don't even now
where we're going.

271
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,864
Well, we're just,
just walking for
the sake of it.

272
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,296
You all right?

273
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,507
I feel like
I know this place.

274
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,970
I recognize
this corridor.

275
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:18,766
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

276
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,269
No, that's not it.

277
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,855
Come check this out.

278
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,733
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

279
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,276
Jess.

280
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,863
Come on.
Come on.

281
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,658
1932. It's the same.
Here's where we boarded.

282
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,786
Oh, yeah.

283
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,955
Aeolus.

284
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,708
Aeolus.

285
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,295
Aeolus was the Greek
god of the winds and
the father of Sisyphus,

286
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,632
the man condemned by the gods
to the task of pushing a rock
up a mountain

287
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,634
and let it see
roll back down again.

288
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,677
That's a shitty
punishment. What
did he do?

289
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:58,598
He cheated Death.
No, he made a promise
to Death that he didn't keep.

290
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,977
I studied it but I can't
remember. Can we just
keep on moving, please?

291
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,484
Hello?

292
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,509
Whoever it was
might wanna come
back for these.

293
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,427
Let me see?

294
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,016
These are mine.

295
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,393
These are my keys.

296
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,894
What are you
talking about?

297
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:45,979
They're mine.

298
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,397
Bullshit.

299
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,565
This is, this is
my house key.

300
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,695
This is my, my car key.
This is my son. See?

301
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,989
Wait. So you had them
with you on the yacht?

302
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,157
Yes.

303
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,409
It's gotta be Heather.

304
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,535
Come on.

305
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,412
How else did
they get here?

306
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:06,332
It was Heather dropping
her keys but not bothering
to say, "I didn't drown."

307
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,625
Why not?

308
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,297
Come on.

309
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,011
Heather?

310
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,861
Looks like you get your
welcome party, just
not the welcome.

311
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,495
Heather!

312
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,581
Yo, Greg, what
time you got?

313
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,000
Eleven thirty.

314
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,002
Heather.

315
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,713
Heather!

316
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,095
Where is everyone?

317
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,722
Heather!

318
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,932
Sally! Please. Please.

319
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,603
I don't know where
everyone is but the
ship's not deserted.

320
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,315
I mean, maybe some of
us think that it is
but it's not,

321
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,941
so let's just go
to the bridge.

322
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,361
We'll find the skipper
and then we'll go home.

323
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,405
I saw someone.

324
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,115
Fuck.

325
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,867
Wait.

326
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,086
Hello?

327
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,024
Did you see
who it was?
Was it Heather?

328
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,693
I didn't see.

329
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,488
I'm sorry.

330
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,031
Where're you going?

331
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,117
Why don't you
just help me out here?

332
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,910
What?

333
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,745
Just wait for Vic.

334
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,166
What?

335
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,251
It's fine.

336
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,877
Why can't we
go with him?

337
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,423
Let's just do as Greg
says and wait here
for Victor, okay?

338
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,590
Fine.

339
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,259
I think Victor's
in danger.

340
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,553
I'm not worried
about Victor.

341
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,639
I'm sorry I'm acting
weird. It's just I'm
having denjavu

342
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,349
every time
I turn a corner.

343
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,684
No, no. No.

344
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,227
I know this place.

345
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,729
No, you don't
know this place.
You're just in shock.

346
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,273
That's funny.

347
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,400
What is it?
What is it?
Is it Tommy?

348
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:41,279
Is it guilt?
Is that what it is?
Do you feel guilty?

349
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,137
Hello?

350
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,014
Hello.

351
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,556
Hello.

352
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,643
We're on the third floor.
The bridge is exactly
two floors above us.

353
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,063
Greg, that was blood.
Are you just gonna
ignore it?

354
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,107
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

355
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,485
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off
some steam.

356
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,573
What? They rescue us
from the sea and then
they just hide for fun?

357
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,075
Yeah.

358
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,119
Well, what's
your theory?

359
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,663
I don't know,
but I'm not,
but I'm not in shock.

360
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,791
I'll be in the ball room.
I'm getting off this ship.

361
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,336
Jess, fuck! Don't you
see that this is all
just in your mind?

362
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,840
Jess! Ships don't
just magically appear
out of nowhere.

363
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,511
They have skippers.
I mean, in your world
right now they don't.

364
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:19,061
My world is waiting
outside school for his
mother to pick him up.

365
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,315
Don't talk to me
about my world.

366
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,902
Jess. Jess, I'm sorry.

367
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,465
Is that blood?

368
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,221
Babe, come on, we're
supposed to meet them
in the theater.

369
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,682
Heather!

370
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,020
Oh, my God. Shit.

371
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,397
Sally. Sal, come on.

372
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,858
Let's just go
to the theater.

373
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,378
Downey, I can't see
anymore blood. I don't
think she's in here.

374
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,339
To be honest with you,
I don't think she's
even on the ship.

375
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,383
Okay. So whose
blood was that?

376
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,225
Hello?

377
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,647
Downey? Sally?

378
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,266
Victor. What happened?

379
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,300
Oh, my God.

380
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,529
Stay with me, Greg.
Stay with me, man.

381
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,989
Stay with me, man.

382
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,911
No. No!

383
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,330
You fucking bitch!
You shot him!

384
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,414
What?

385
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,041
He said you shot him.

386
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,709
I didn't!

387
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:29,919
Fucking liar!

388
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,378
I wasn't even
with Greg!

389
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,549
He's dead!
He's dead!
Look!

390
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,426
God, you're a bitch!

391
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,726
Get your hands off him!

392
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,521
I didn't do it!
I was with Victor.

393
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,065
Someone attacked him.

394
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,900
Someone?

395
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,486
You think I did it?

396
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,072
Why did you tell us
to come to the theater?

397
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,326
I didn't. I-
Sally, I didn't.

398
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,911
I didn't.

399
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,455
My God, you're
a fucking skitso.

400
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,917
Sally, no.

401
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,929
Sally!

402
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,722
No!

403
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,936
Downey!

404
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,398
Let it go. Let it go.

405
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,316
No!

406
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,662
Don't shoot. Please.

407
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,084
Please, don't
shoot. Please.

408
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,670
I have a son.
I have a son.

409
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,361
Shit.

410
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,750
Who are you?
Tell me!

411
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,252
Who are you?

412
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,131
What the fuck
are you saying?

413
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,383
It's the only way
to get home.

414
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:29,968
What?

415
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,054
You have to kill them.

416
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,225
Kill them!
Kill them!
Kill them!

417
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,854
Over here.
Come on. Hey!

418
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,859
Help us, please!

419
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,237
Help!

420
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,698
Hey. Hey.

421
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,492
Help us!

422
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,826
Please!

423
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,789
There, there. Over there.
I can see somebody.

424
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,958
Please!

425
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,910
Hello?

426
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:43,704
Looks like they decided
to scratch the welcome.

427
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,580
Let's go
to the bridge.

428
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:49,167
We'll get the captain
to put a call out to
the coast guard.

429
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,882
Hello!

430
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,977
Hello?

431
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,113
Where the fuck
is everybody?

432
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,329
Do you even know
where we're going?

433
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,922
Well, we're just,
just walking for
the sake of it.

434
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,595
You all right?

435
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,264
I feel like
I know this place.

436
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,975
I recognize
this corridor.

437
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,520
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

438
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,148
No, that's not it.

439
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,735
Jess, come on.

440
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,404
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

441
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:02,783
Yeah. 1932.

442
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,035
It is the same.
Here's where we boarded.

443
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,705
Yeah. Aeolus.

444
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,957
Aeolus.

445
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,169
Aeolus was the Greek
god of the winds and
the father of Sisyphus,

446
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,547
the man condemned by the gods
to the task of pushing a rock
up a mountain

447
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,466
only to have it
roll back down again.

448
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,718
That's a shitty
punishment. What
did he do?

449
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:25,430
He cheated Death.
No, he made a promise
to Death that he didn't keep.

450
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:28,683
I studied him and I
can't remember. Can we
just keep on moving?

451
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,482
Hello?

452
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,594
Heather?

453
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,472
Hello!

454
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,393
Heather!

455
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,272
Heather!

456
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:01,067
Sally. Please. I don't
know where everyone is.

457
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,736
But the ship's
not deserted.

458
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,239
I mean, maybe some of
us think that it is
but it's not,

459
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,782
so let's just go
to the bridge.

460
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,869
We'll find the skipper
and then we go home.

461
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,330
I saw someone.

462
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,084
Hello?

463
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,717
Hello.

464
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,647
Shit. How did you
get here so fast?

465
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,276
Victor, you got, you
gotta listen to me. We
don't have much time.

466
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,986
Oh, what's going on?
Where's Greg?

467
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,112
He's dead.

468
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,488
What?

469
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,407
No, I mean,
he was dead.
He's not dead now.

470
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,908
What are you saying?

471
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:35,620
Downstairs right now
is a copy of myself.

472
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:38,707
Me, walking and
talking with Greg.

473
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,710
Right.

474
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,176
There.

475
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,720
There's birds.

476
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,597
No, that was
Downey's body.

477
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,641
I just left Downey
back there. How did
you get here so fast?

478
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,102
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

479
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:13,283
No. Downey was there.
It was Downey's body.

480
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,246
There are bodies
all over this ship.

481
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:22,208
Your body is on the floor
at the restaurant with
a hole in your head.

482
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,669
Listen, I'm gonna do
you a favor, okay?

483
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,880
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

484
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:31,343
It's the truth.
Victor, we gotta get
off this ship right now.

485
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,386
You're saying there's
two of you now.

486
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,055
Yes.

487
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,681
And I'm dead
in the restaurant.

488
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:38,308
You were killed.

489
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:42,145
Okay. So, I'm dead.
Downey's in the water.
He's dead, too.

490
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,314
Is Sally okay?

491
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,858
See where I'm going
with this, right?

492
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,777
If we are dead and
there's two of you,

493
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,862
how are we all gonna
get off this ship?

494
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,239
We should never have
boarded this ship.

495
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,033
I knew something
was wrong.

496
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,453
I should've forced you
to stay on the yacht
and you'd all be alive.

497
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,664
I've gotta tell you
I feel pretty alive
right now.

498
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,918
Soon you're gonna be dead.
Everything that happened
to you, happened before.

499
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,754
I can't even believe
I'm talking this shit.

500
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,299
You will die and then,
then Downey and Sally
and then Greg.

501
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,109
I didn't do this.
I didn't do it.

502
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,043
We're on the third level.

503
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:50,380
Greg, that was blood.
You just gonna ignore it?

504
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,424
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

505
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,385
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off
some steam.

506
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,648
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

507
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,276
Ships don't just
magically appear
out of nowhere.

508
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,863
They have skippers.
I mean, in your world
right now they don't.

509
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:19,367
My world is waiting
outside school for his
mother to pick him up.

510
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,954
Don't talk to me
about my world.

511
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,886
Who are you?

512
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,224
Who are you?

513
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:41,658
Who are you?

514
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,743
Listen, listen to me.

515
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:46,037
Please, you have
to listen.

516
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,249
Kill them all.

517
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,460
If they board,
kill them.

518
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,923
Jess. Jess, you
gotta kill them.

519
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,217
Please, you have
to listen.

520
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,594
Don't let them board.

521
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,931
No, no. No.
Please, please.
Stop, stop them.

522
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,267
If they board,
kill them.

523
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,727
Jess. Jess, you
gotta kill them.

524
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,646
If they board,
kill them.

525
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,650
No, no. No.
Please, please, stop.
If they board, kill them.

526
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,987
Please, please stop.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

527
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,656
Fuck you!

528
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,304
Shit.

529
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,772
Tommy.

530
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,912
Is that blood?

531
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,124
Babe, come on. We're
supposed to meet them
at the theater.

532
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:23,653
Victor.

533
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,617
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

534
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:32,954
You know I didn't mean
to hurt you, right?

535
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:36,290
Now, I'm gonna try
and get us off
this ship, okay?

536
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,084
Sally.

537
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,587
Sally?

538
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:47,552
Sally?

539
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,570
Victor?

540
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:07,363
What happened?

541
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,214
You're not me.

542
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,316
You're not me.

543
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,266
You see?
I'm not crazy.

544
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,649
Victor.

545
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:28,528
This didn't happen
before. Don't you see?

546
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,197
You tried to
strangle me, remember?

547
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,783
Now, you gotta be strong.
I'm gonna get the others.

548
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,707
Downey, do something.

549
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,376
Stay with me, man.

550
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,211
Do something.

551
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,712
I don't know
what to do.

552
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,465
Is he dead?
Is he dead?

553
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,301
Greg. Greg.

554
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:55,680
You fucking-

555
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,349
Listen, I'm not gonna
hurt you. We don't
have much time.

556
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,892
Don't you point
that thing.

557
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,644
Move!

558
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,980
Go, go, go.

559
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,733
I hit her.
I think I hit her.

560
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,318
What's going on?
Who was that?

561
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,822
It's starting over again.
That's what's going on.

562
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,073
Let's go.

563
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,700
We can't leave
without Greg.

564
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,411
We'll come back
for Greg. I promise.
Let's go, come on!

565
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,583
We can change
the pattern.
Don't you see?

566
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:27,420
We change the pattern,
we're not trapped. Then
we get off this thing.

567
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,380
She's fucking mad.

568
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,423
You think?

569
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,632
You have to
listen to me.

570
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,134
No, I don't have
to listen to you.

571
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,635
Was it me
that shot you?

572
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,220
I don't know.

573
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,764
Whoa, wait.
Could we just take
a breath for a second?

574
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,017
Okay, Jess, I am prepared
to listen to you

575
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,436
and even to believe
you, but you gotta
make some sense.

576
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,231
I'm making perfect sense.
I'm gonna get Victor, then
we get off this ship.

577
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:49,984
Wait here.

578
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,821
And don't trust anyone.

579
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:56,407
If anyone comes,
you shoot them.

580
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,950
What are you
talking about?

581
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:59,368
You shoot them.

582
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,330
What?

583
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,924
Victor.

584
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,509
Victor?

585
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,791
I said who is it?

586
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,259
I said who is it?

587
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,398
It's me, Jess.

588
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,361
Jesus Christ, what
the fuck happened to you?

589
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,405
A long story.

590
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,368
Where's Victor?

591
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,078
He's dead.

592
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,291
He fell over
the side.

593
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,919
How do we know
you didn't kill him?

594
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:33,629
You don't.

595
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:36,132
If you wanna live,
you'll follow me.

596
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,306
Downey!

597
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,224
Ignore it.

598
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,393
Downey!

599
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,894
What's going on?

600
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,105
Is said ignore it.

601
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,940
Where are you?
Call out.

602
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:57,486
No, I'm not just
gonna ignore it.
What is going on?

603
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,363
Where the fuck
are you?

604
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:03,034
Call out!
You're in danger.
You're in danger.

605
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,536
Who is that?

606
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,621
Not who you think?

607
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,673
So, what are we
doing in here?

608
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,654
Sally!

609
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,448
Wait!

610
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,002
I'm sorry but
I love my son.

611
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,008
Sally?

612
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:03,135
That wasn't me.

613
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,057
Sally?

614
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,797
Sally?

615
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,491
Hello? Hello?

616
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:09,910
Please, can
you hear me?

617
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:12,413
Help me.
Please, help me.

618
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,165
She's killing everyone.

619
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:17,543
They're dead.
They're all dead.
Please-

620
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,378
Sally?

621
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:22,381
What's your
position? Over.

622
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,180
Sally.

623
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:32,558
Distressed caller,
we hear you. What are
your coordinates? Over.

624
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:39,064
Coast guard, did you hear
a distress call? We're not
getting in anymore. Over.

625
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,901
Greg.

626
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,528
Greg, is that you?

627
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:52,786
Distressed caller, make
another transmission.
What is your position?

628
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,122
Greg, can you
hear me? Greg.

629
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,627
Shit.

630
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,638
Sally?

631
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,687
Sally?

632
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,286
Oh, my God, what
happened to you?

633
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,414
Get away from me.

634
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:21,959
It wasn't me, Sally.
I didn't do this to you.

635
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,881
It wasn't me.
Where is Downey?

636
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:30,634
I don't know
where he is.

637
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:32,052
You killed him.

638
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,555
What?

639
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,017
No, I didn't.
I didn't kill him.

640
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,226
What?

641
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:40,561
I swear.

642
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,688
You're crazy.

643
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,815
Why are you
doing this?

644
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,693
Sally, I know it's hard
but you gotta trust me.

645
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,154
Gotta trust me, okay?

646
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,516
Listen, you
gotta hold on.

647
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,101
I think it will
return again.

648
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:25,230
The yacht, the Triangle,
I think it'll come back.

649
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,233
If it does, we'll escape,
me and you together.

650
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,111
We'll re-board it
and escape.

651
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,490
Please.

652
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,870
Don't hurt me.

653
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,331
Sally, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

654
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,168
If you hold on,

655
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,879
you can see
Downey again.

656
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,910
Hey, come on.
Over here.

657
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:23,205
Hey. Hey. Help.

658
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,916
It returns when
they're dead.

659
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:34,007
It returns when
everyone's dead.

660
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,524
Do you think Heather
would've made it
on board?

661
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,817
Honey.

662
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,485
There's a chance,
isn't there?

663
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,529
Yeah. Yeah,
there's a chance.

664
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:49,374
Stop this thing.

665
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,543
Stop this fucking thing.

666
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,982
Please.

667
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,443
I wanna go home.

668
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,739
I wanna go home.

669
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:50,435
He's dead.
I mean, he
was dead.

670
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,646
He's not dead now.

671
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,023
I was hiding and I saw
this version of myself,

672
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:58,902
and she had blood
on her face, and
then I killed her.

673
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,779
I killed her on
the front of the ship.

674
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:02,781
Listen, I'm gonna
do you a favor, okay?

675
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:05,075
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

676
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,077
It's the truth.
You gotta listen to me.

677
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,454
No, I'm not listening
to another word you say.

678
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,375
You will die, and then
Greg and then Downey.

679
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:47,034
Don't be scared, Victor.
I can save you.

680
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,455
I know how to save you.

681
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,240
You should try
and eat, babe.

682
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,161
Jess?

683
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:27,134
Jesus, what
happened to you?

684
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,760
Where's Greg?

685
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,430
Greg told me to tell you
we should meet in
the theater.

686
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,224
There's a theater?

687
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,935
Yes, it's just
that way.

688
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,520
Where are you going?

689
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,272
I'll see you there.

690
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,650
Okay, she's really
starting to freak
me out now.

691
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,482
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

692
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:27,527
Ships don't just magically
appear out of nowhere.
They have skippers.

693
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,654
In your world
right now maybe
they don't.

694
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:34,826
My world is waiting
outside school for his
mother to pick him up.

695
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,788
Don't talk to me
about my world.

696
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:40,957
Jess.

697
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,876
Jess, I'm sorry.

698
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:21,915
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

699
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,959
Okay.

700
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,711
Take it easy, man.

701
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,797
Just take it easy.

702
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,636
What did we do?
We're not part
of this boat.

703
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:38,306
We just got here, okay?
We've been walking around.
There's no one on it.

704
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:41,601
I can go right
now. I will go.

705
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:45,105
Okay? Just-
Just take it easy.

706
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,065
Take it easy.

707
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,900
Okay?

708
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,741
Jess?

709
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,911
Jess.

710
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,371
Jess, what
are you doing?

711
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:05,917
Wha-what is this?
Why-what are
you wearing?

712
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,003
I don't want you
to see my face.

713
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,629
Why?

714
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:12,048
Because this
is not me.

715
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,844
I'm somewhere out there
in the yacht and
you're with me.

716
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,807
And after I kill you,
we'll return.

717
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:23,059
Is that right?

718
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:28,064
You know, why-why
don't you just put
down the gun first?

719
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,859
Okay? Come on.

720
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,445
You see, the boat
comes back when
you're all dead.

721
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,697
I've done everything
exactly like before.

722
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:38,617
But when the boat
comes back, I'll be
ready, I'll be waiting.

723
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:43,079
I'll be on the landing bay.
I won't let any of them
board, even the other me.

724
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,498
I'll make them all stay
on the upturned yacht.

725
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,833
Okay.

726
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:50,921
Jess, we'll do
whatever you want.

727
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:54,382
Okay? Just, just
put down the gun.

728
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,303
Come on.

729
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,888
I'm so sorry.

730
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,556
No, no, no, no!

731
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,352
Greg!

732
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,270
Oh, God!
What happened?

733
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:09,064
It was Jess.

734
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:12,859
You fucking bitch!
You shot him. He
said you shot him.

735
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:14,402
I wasn't even
with Greg!

736
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,655
He's dead!
He's dead!

737
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:20,951
My God, you're a
fucking skitso.

738
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,497
Downey!

739
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:41,948
Please.

740
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:44,743
Don't kill me.

741
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:47,329
I have a son.

742
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,331
I have a son.

743
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,829
Who are you?

744
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:12,831
Tell me!

745
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,499
They'll return.

746
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,334
Who are you?

747
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:18,920
They'll return.
You have to kill them.

748
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,505
It's the only way
to get home.

749
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,048
What the fuck
are you saying?

750
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:24,676
It's the only way
to save our son.

751
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,177
You have to kill them.

752
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,638
Kill them?
Kill them?

753
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:57,221
Hurry up, Sweetheart.
We're gonna be late.

754
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,133
What's fun in
buying you things

755
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,719
if you're gonna leave
them in the fucking garden!

756
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:38,888
I'm sick of telling
you this, Tommy.

757
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:43,101
I ain't buying you anymore
toys if you can't look after
the ones you've got.

758
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:51,025
Now what?

759
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,155
Oh, I'll just
clean it up, shall I?

760
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:02,120
Yeah, I'm just cleaning
the fucking mess!

761
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:08,751
What's the matter
with you, huh? What's
the matter with you?

762
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:12,880
Just one day off
is all I ask. Just
one fucking day off!

763
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,636
I don't know why you
can't paint a picture
like a normal kid.

764
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,180
You get this
from your father.

765
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,516
He was an asshole, too.

766
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:39,574
Shit.

767
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,129
Jack?

768
01:24:53,213 --> 01:24:55,757
Did you see anyone
ring my doorbell?

769
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,420
Tommy?

770
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,673
Sweetheart, come here.

771
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:41,385
Come here.
Come here!
It's okay.

772
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,812
Mommy's fine,
you see?

773
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,190
Mommy's fine.

774
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,779
You're just having
a bad dream. That's
all, baby.

775
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:02,698
It's all it was.

776
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:06,077
Bad dreams make you
think you've seen
things that you haven't.

777
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:54,709
Things are gonna be
different now, Tommy.

778
01:26:56,503 --> 01:26:58,963
Mommy won't lose
her temper anymore,

779
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,215
even when you
do things wrong.

780
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,468
And she won't hurt you.

781
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,805
I know she
won't hurt you.

782
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:11,225
You know how
I know that, Tommy?

783
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:15,146
Because that woman that
did those things to you
is not Mommy.

784
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,316
This is Mommy.
Mommy's nice.

785
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,901
Shit.

786
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:26,115
Shit.

787
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,714
Tommy, stay in the car.

788
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:43,925
I'm gonna
bury it, okay?

789
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:48,155
We have to go.
We have to get
out of here.

790
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,912
Stop screaming, babe.

791
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:57,790
Please, Tommy,
is just blood.

792
01:28:57,874 --> 01:28:59,709
Stop screaming!

793
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:02,503
Tommy, look. See?
There, it's gone.

794
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,880
See? There. It's gone.

795
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,806
Are you all right?

796
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:44,188
Who are you?

797
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,981
Just a driver.

798
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:56,325
No point trying
to save the boy.

799
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:59,370
There's nothing anyone
can do that's gonna
bring him back.

800
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,917
Can I give you a ride?

801
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,715
Yes.

802
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,510
Take me to the harbor.

803
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,617
Hey.

804
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:46,167
I'll leave
the meter running.

805
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:54,633
You will come
back, won't you?

806
01:31:57,012 --> 01:32:00,097
Yes, I-I promise.

807
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,036
Jess.

808
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:28,209
Do you know me?

809
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:31,879
I feel like I do.
Greg talks about
you enough.

810
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:35,633
Where is Greg?

811
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:37,718
Where do you think?

812
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:39,762
Come on, you're late.

813
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:41,931
You're the one
with the kid, right?

814
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:44,642
Yeah.

815
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,852
How come you didn't
bring him along?

816
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,904
He's at school.

817
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,573
You sure about that?

818
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:01,492
Yes.

819
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,836
Are you okay?

820
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:15,547
I don't think so.

821
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:18,092
Hey, what's the matter?
What happened?

822
01:33:21,388 --> 01:33:22,846
Hey.

823
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,598
I'm sorry.

824
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:28,852
You have nothing
to apologize for.
What's the matter?

825
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,854
I'm just tired.

826
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,607
Listen, we don't
have to go today if
you don't want to.

827
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:36,360
No, I do.
I-I wanna go.

828
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,737
Are you sure?

829
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:46,328
Yeah.

830
01:33:46,413 --> 01:33:48,497
Yeah? Come,
come here.

831
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:58,048
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

832
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,884
This is Heather,
Sally's friend. You
remember Victor.

833
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,761
Let's go sailing.

834
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:04,805
Okay.
