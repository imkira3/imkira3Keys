1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:41,751
- Make a wish.
- You got one?

3
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,490
Yeah. Okay.

4
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:48,949
- Okay. Ready?
- Yes.

5
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:56,231
So, we are almost at Joshua Tree

6
00:00:56,331 --> 00:01:00,537
and the excitement level
in the car is off the charts.

7
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:02,830
Right, guys?

8
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,875
Yep. Off the charts.

9
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:10,846
And I probably shouldn't be
filming this while driving.

10
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,843
So, Megan... any last words?

11
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:23,718
Wait a second.

12
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:27,456
No, no, no.

13
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:39,033
<i>I'm always chasing rainbows</i>

14
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,400
<i>Waiting to find</i>

15
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,958
<i>A little bluebird</i>

16
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:51,780
<i>In vain</i>

17
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:01,357
Locate Fila virus survivors.

18
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:05,115
Administer mosquito. Red retrieve.

19
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:07,136
Black leave.

20
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:10,532
Locate Fila virus survivors.

21
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:14,790
Administer mosquito. Red retrieve.

22
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,818
Black leave.

23
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,777
Locate Fila virus survivors.

24
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:25,250
Administer mosquito. Red retrieve.

25
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,292
Black leave.

26
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:37,251
So, you deploy in seven.

27
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,330
Your team has to be en route
by first light,

28
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,454
- so we have to do a rapid fire brief.
- Yes, sir.

29
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,667
Everything in the command
is coded by uniform.

30
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,768
The navigators wear green.
The drivers wear gray.

31
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:49,472
The gunners are camo.
The doctors are in tan.

32
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:55,136
There's one of each on every team.
Now, you've been assigned Unit 730-A.

33
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,445
Say hello to your new best friend.

34
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,606
It's time to suit up.

35
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:08,658
So, have you...

36
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:12,341
Have you seen what's out there?
I mean outside the gate?

37
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:16,098
Not lately.
I have a rational fear of dying.

38
00:04:16,198 --> 00:04:18,201
What's been happening
is that the extraction teams

39
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,637
have been bringing back the infected
with the uninfecteds.

40
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:24,107
So, we've embedded a doctor with
each team to do the testing in the field,

41
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:27,744
because one slip up could bring
the whole compound down.

42
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:32,270
So, the doctor's job, your job,
is to make sure that doesn't happen.

43
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,413
This goes up...

44
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:39,147
and over. How's it feel?

45
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:47,296
Heavy.

46
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:49,932
We received this transmission
from Dr. Ward.

47
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:55,203
<i>Control, this is Dr. Ward. We came across
98 uninfected at Saint Mary's supply drop.</i>

48
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:58,273
<i>Fortysix are accompanying us.
We need to send...</i>

49
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:01,222
And it just cuts out.
No more communication.

50
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:03,479
We don't know where Ward is.

51
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,859
Now, we presume
that the remaining 52 uninfected

52
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,585
are barricaded inside
Saint Mary's prep downtown.

53
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,254
Your mission is to get down there,
retrieve this virus

54
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,523
and bring it back to the compound.

55
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,592
You'll be with Team 314.

56
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,760
- The navigator'll have the details.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,522
Okay, here's a geographic illustration
of where the virus started.

58
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,954
And here's where we are now.

59
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,239
I'll take that back.

60
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:33,441
Okay, so the camera stays on at all times.

61
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,112
The information we've recorded
has been invaluable in the fight.

62
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:38,781
I'm gonna check your kit, okay?

63
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:42,785
You don't need this. All communication
will be through the suit transmitter.

64
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:47,058
- Sir, in New York we took extra phones.
- No exceptions.

65
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:48,759
- Understood, doctor?
- Yes, sir.

66
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:51,594
Great. Okay. Stay here.
We're gonna check the seal.

67
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:54,155
You have three minutes till departure.

68
00:05:57,332 --> 00:06:00,260
All right, raise your hands and rotate.

69
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:09,578
Clear. Light and radio check.

70
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:12,915
- Night vision activated.
- Helmet light?

71
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:15,309
No, right side.

72
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:18,079
Helmet light off.

73
00:06:18,521 --> 00:06:20,321
And radio?

74
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,827
- <i>Left, right. Left, right.</i>
- Radio is functional.

75
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,096
That building over there,
that's Quarantine A.

76
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:30,865
When you return, the survivors
are brought there for isolation.

77
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:32,300
What's in there?

78
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,003
That's where you bring the survivors.
That's all you need to know.

79
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,306
This is Quarantine B.

80
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:40,442
This is where the infected
are brought for research.

81
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,845
Now, we've separated
the infected into five types.

82
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:46,198
- I'm sorry. You said five?
- Level 1...

83
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:50,252
flu-like symptoms.
Initially mistaken for Ebola.

84
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:52,721
This is Level 2, the hemorrhaging begins.

85
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:57,126
Level 3, patient secrets a black necrotic
blood from prolonged internal hemorrhaging,

86
00:06:57,226 --> 00:07:02,398
brain damage from blood loss, confusion
from high fever, extreme aggression.

87
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:05,300
- And here's Level 4.
- Help us. Please.

88
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,160
This is the interesting stage,
the hibernation stage.

89
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,268
Kinda like suspended animation.
Comatose, unresponsive.

90
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:14,876
The heart eventually stops,
or so we thought.

91
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,280
But it actually slows
so that it's virtually untraceable.

92
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,448
Look at these two.
They come together in love,

93
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:25,221
but the first one to wake up will kill
the other one and not know why.

94
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:28,825
We were euthanizing Level 4's,
but we ran outta potassium chloride.

95
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:32,295
And that's when we discovered
a second incubation. Follow me.

96
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:35,898
Wait. We only diagnosed
four levels of infection.

97
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,733
Yeah. Well, no wonder New York fell.

98
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,037
Okay, now...

99
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:46,608
Do not step off the yellow line.
Repeat that.

100
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:50,305
- Do not step off the yellow line.
- Okay.

101
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,885
Level 5, severe brain damage.

102
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:01,524
The Fila virus
has mutated into a rabid state.

103
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:04,192
The patient becomes extremely violent

104
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:09,188
and will attack and kill anything
it encounters, even its own family.

105
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:14,609
- Let me go! Somebody, help me!
- I told you to stay on the yellow line!

106
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:29,452
Listen, you drop your guard
for one second and they will kill you.

107
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,345
We can't have that, doctor,
you're too valuable.

108
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,952
- Jesus.
- What are they doing?

109
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:43,669
- You're shooting them?
- Yeah, that's the way it is.

110
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:47,003
Look, we're not proud of it, but humanity
left this city a long time ago.

111
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,550
I thought that was all we had left.

112
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,007
This is an uphill battle
we're fighting and we are losing.

113
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:53,409
I know you worked a long time
in the lab. If you can't make it...

114
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:55,528
New York wasn't a cake walk.

115
00:08:55,628 --> 00:08:59,578
I survived there. I made it here.

116
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:01,784
I can handle it.

117
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,611
Good.

118
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:41,749
It's time to move.

119
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,374
- Is your radio off?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:10,085
This is between you and me. You're the only
one with CDC credentials on the team.

121
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:13,155
Now, while the gunner has
tactical command, you're in charge.

122
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:16,514
Now, if you become infected,
keep it to yourself. Don't tell anyone.

123
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:18,694
And when you return,
you'll be taken care of.

124
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:23,566
With antitoxins, Level 1 is treatable.
That applies to you and you alone.

125
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:27,903
If another member of the team gets infected,
you leave by any means necessary.

126
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:32,408
Now, we stayed strong for 33 days.
New York fell. We don't have to.

127
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:36,645
- Now, state your mission.
- Extraction. Saint Mary's Prep.

128
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:39,029
Eighty-nine Fila virus survivors.

129
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,313
Locate. Administer mosquito.
Red retrieve. Black...

130
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:45,421
- If the blood test is positive?
- We leave them behind.

131
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:50,426
Without exception. Hey, Lauren, good luck.

132
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,720
Thank you, sir.

133
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:58,767
Sir?

134
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:06,308
I was just wondering if we have any
new information about... Team 313.

135
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,803
No. Sorry.

136
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:11,596
- Sir?
- Yeah?

137
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:15,246
- Permission to search for 313?
- Turn your radio on.

138
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:18,955
Listen up, everyone. This is Dr. Greer.
Stay in the designated group.

139
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:22,725
Do not deviate to look for family
and friends. Stay strong.

140
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:27,657
Snatch the survivors.
Get home safe. Greer out.

141
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:31,066
You the doc on my 314?

142
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:35,742
- Yes, I'm Dr. Lauren Chase.
- You look fresh.

143
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:38,074
You got red on you, man.

144
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:41,376
You already bringing bad luck
and we ain't even out the gate yet.

145
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:43,804
Let's get this over with.

146
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,624
- So, you're the navigator?
- I am. I'm Denise.

147
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,704
Right. Dr. Chase.

148
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:01,623
- Mind if I take a look at the route?
- Sure thing.

149
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:05,358
I laid out three routes
based on unobstructed roads.

150
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,291
- Let's... let's try Number 2.
- Okay.

151
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:16,346
Hey, Doc, why don't you focus
on doing your own job? Let us do ours.

152
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:20,116
Hey, ignore him.
We're very happy to have you on board.

153
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:23,277
- Thank you.
- Okay.

154
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,085
Good morning, doctor.

155
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,348
We need you stand watch in the rear
when we get through the tunnel.

156
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:57,519
This is for me? I'd rather stay back here
and do my work if that's possible.

157
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,888
We need everyone. Here.

158
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,274
Take it. Take it.

159
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:10,298
- You ever play Whac-A-Mole?
- Yeah.

160
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,535
Okay, good.
Then you understand the concept.

161
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:16,305
If a mole pokes his head in,
you whack 'em right back out.

162
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:19,307
Just try to think of it
as a game. It'll help.

163
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:24,339
If you feel like you're in trouble,
just yell out. All right.

164
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,798
Wheeler, let's do it.

165
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,474
Bus 314 ready for transport.

166
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:31,146
Open in five, four, three, two...

167
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,474
Remember. It's just a game.

168
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:37,887
Oh, my God.

169
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:17,331
Gunner, get your ass up here, man.

170
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:22,474
- Let me in. Let me in.
- Fuckin' shoot him.

171
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:25,417
- I'll break the windshield.
- What the fuck do you think he's doin'?

172
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:27,728
Open the damn door.

173
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,101
- Keep it steady.
- You fuckin' crazy?

174
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:49,049
Fuck. Somebody get Gunner.

175
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:54,176
- Slow down. You're too fast.
- No, keep goin'.

176
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,389
Don't stop. Come on. Pull me back in.

177
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:04,499
No! Denise, help me!

178
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,076
Close the door.

179
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:33,672
Hey, help me.

180
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,957
Are we clear?

181
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:20,370
I said, are we clear?

182
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,082
Gunner?

183
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:39,601
We're clear.

184
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:41,528
Thanks.

185
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,253
That... wasn't a game.

186
00:17:58,353 --> 00:18:00,717
No, it's not.

187
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:06,359
So, next time, do us all a favor.
Fight back like your life depends on it.

188
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,313
Weren't we supposed to turn there?
The designated route

189
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:15,203
- takes us through Sherman Oaks.
- Jesus. How fuckin' green are you?

190
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,706
Tell me somethin',
you're not familiar with the suburbs?

191
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:21,744
- I was in Manhattan.
- But you have seen Level 5's, right?

192
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,614
I've seen one... today.

193
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:29,750
Well, imagine hundreds of 'em
and they all got eyes for you.

194
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,286
That's what you get in the suburbs.

195
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:34,689
I'm sure it's fine. They're not gonna
send us through there if it's dangerous.

196
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,793
In downtown, all we have
to deal with are Level 2's and 3's.

197
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:40,096
Roaming the streets in gangs, armed.

198
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,865
She's got a point.
I say we park this bitch, chill.

199
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:46,165
Then head back in like a few hours.
Tell Greer we didn't find shit.

200
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:48,840
No, we have our destination.

201
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,001
We're going downtown to Saint Mary's.

202
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:56,622
- That's where 313 made their last call.
- Where the fuck is 313?

203
00:18:57,222 --> 00:19:02,883
- Alls we bringin' back are corpses, man.
- Listen, Saint Mary's is a supply drop.

204
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:06,421
Do you wanna eat?
Does everyone want to eat?

205
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:10,349
You heard Greer.
We stick to the designated route.

206
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:14,863
I am the Commanding Officer, and I say
we're going through Sherman Oaks.

207
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:18,900
If you wanna follow Greer's plan, go ahead.
Be my guest. Go out and steal a car.

208
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,069
But if you wanna stay alive,
then you stay with us.

209
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:26,000
And we're not goin'
through any suburbs. That's final.

210
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,972
Hey.

211
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:34,206
We're just changing the route.
We're not changing the plan. I promise.

212
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,602
What's 313?

213
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:41,924
Another team. They went to Saint Mary's
on a supply run, came across the survivors.

214
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:45,443
But 313 never made it back.

215
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:50,323
- His wife was their gunner.
- Greer played me the tape from your doctor.

216
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:01,286
Okay, you're gonna try to get
on this freeway here on the onramp.

217
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:03,437
Just be careful.

218
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:13,067
No. Pick up.

219
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,561
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

220
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:18,326
<i>It's about time you called.</i>

221
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,854
<i>Too bad I'm not here. So leave a message.</i>

222
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,094
There's no use for it.

223
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:31,932
We use our suit transmitters for com.

224
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,935
Get back in your seat.

225
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:05,406
Where is everybody?

226
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:08,509
There aren't many left alive,
but most of them stick around churches.

227
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:11,680
And parking garages,
they treat those things like roach motels.

228
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,483
They're not roaches.
They're starving and scared.

229
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,711
Fuck this.

230
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:19,888
Don't worry. I'll put it back on.

231
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,291
You said you were in Manhattan.
Is that where you're from?

232
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:27,463
No, I'm from here. I was moved to New York
to be part of a team working on the vaccine.

233
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:29,898
Can you tell us how it's going,
finding a cure and all?

234
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:34,262
We've made some promising
breakthroughs with antitoxins. We...

235
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:39,275
We've extracted the contaminant from the
defective cells. We feel very confident...

236
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,277
Ain't nobody even figured out
what caused this shit-fest, man.

237
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:44,662
And we countin' on these same
fuckin' idiots to save us.

238
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,783
- I heard it was in the water.
- There were lice and Ebola mutations,

239
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:50,585
brain parasites, the rapture.
I've heard 'em all.

240
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,120
What about you guys? You from LA?

241
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,992
- I lived in the valley with my son.
- Is he back at the compound?

242
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:59,393
This is Josh.

243
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:03,156
He passed before the virus hit,
of leukemia.

244
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:09,520
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:14,976
It doesn't what we did before.
It only matters what we do now.

246
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:19,113
Bullshit. Look at you
tryin' to act all tough.

247
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,817
- He was a traffic cop.
- Go head. Keep talkin'.

248
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:24,690
That piece might make you feel safe,
but you need it.

249
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,137
Anybody can pull a trigger.
You're just Greer's bitch.

250
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:29,992
- Wheeler?
- No, let this jerkoff say what he wants.

251
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,227
- Put that down. I'll say a lot more.
- Yeah.

252
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:35,430
Y'all didn't ask me shit,
but I'll tell you anyway.

253
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,139
Forty-two, 92, seven off.

254
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,681
I call this work release.

255
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,870
- You're a felon.
- That scare you?

256
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,041
No. We all do
whatever it takes to survive.

257
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:51,113
For some of us,
this may be one last opportunity.

258
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:54,107
Yeah. For what?

259
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:00,146
A second chance.

260
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:05,160
Please stop! Please...

261
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:09,940
Help me. Please stop.

262
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:18,873
What the fuck is this?

263
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:21,367
- She doesn't look sick.
- Please...

264
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,879
All right, get what you need.

265
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:27,214
- I'm not sick. Please!
- Oh, man.

266
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:29,385
What are you doin'?
Get your tools. Your tools.

267
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:31,343
Shit.

268
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,790
Get me out of here, please!

269
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,316
Let's go, doctor!

270
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:42,873
Open the door.

271
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:51,473
Please get me out of here. I'm not...
Please get me out of here.

272
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:54,376
All right. Just take it easy.
We're gonna take care of you.

273
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,912
- Just relax. Just relax.
- Get me out of here.

274
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:59,715
Please. We have to get
out of here. I'm not sick.

275
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:04,319
Doc, what the hell are you doin'? Come on.
Check and see if she's infected. Let's go.

276
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:07,388
We have to get out of here now.
We have to get out of here now!

277
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,008
We will, ma'am. You have to calm down now.

278
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:12,693
I'm not sick. I'm not... I'm not sick.

279
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:15,797
- Come on. What are you doin'?
- Making sure this... this test...

280
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:19,759
Doctor, what are you doin'? Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give it to me.

281
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,373
- Here.
- I'm not sick, please.

282
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:27,734
All right, listen, just...
just turn around. Turn around.

283
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:32,572
Come on, Doctor.

284
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,652
Talk to me, Doctor. How she doin'?

285
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:42,089
She's not infected. She's not infected.
We can take her with us.

286
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,650
Let's get her on the bus. Let's go!

287
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:49,231
- Gunner, she's... she's stuck.
- She's what? What?

288
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:53,135
She's stuck. Gunner, she's stuck.
She's taped to the grate. I...

289
00:24:53,335 --> 00:24:56,005
- Please, don't let me die. Please!
- Doctor, get back on the bus.

290
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:59,650
Get back on the bus!
It's a trap. It's a trap.

291
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:09,375
- Get on the bus!
- All right, let's go. Let's go.

292
00:25:14,488 --> 00:25:16,649
Open the door.

293
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:50,357
Come on, come on, you can make it.
Grab my hand.

294
00:25:50,457 --> 00:25:53,703
- Wheeler, slow down.
- I can't!

295
00:25:57,032 --> 00:25:58,933
You're gonna shoot Gunner!

296
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:01,469
Shoot, damn it, shoot.

297
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,797
Shit!

298
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:06,441
Slow down! Slow down!

299
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,914
Run, you motherfucker, run!

300
00:26:13,914 --> 00:26:16,251
He's in! He's in! He's in!

301
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:21,455
Never again, you hear me. You learn
your ass to run like the rest of us.

302
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,379
Is it over?

303
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,091
- What are you doing?
- Listen to me.

304
00:26:26,191 --> 00:26:29,029
You better start fightin' back
or you gonna get us all killed,

305
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,033
and I'm not lettin' that happen.
You understand me?

306
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,485
Now, you go to Denise and then
you fix my goddamn shoulder.

307
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:38,164
Now do your damn job!

308
00:26:44,378 --> 00:26:46,904
How could they do that?

309
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:49,280
Everybody has their limit.

310
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:54,188
Think of it like being underwater.

311
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,992
Holding your breath, you're fine,
but once you reach a certain point...

312
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:00,821
you'll do anything to get back on top.

313
00:27:15,576 --> 00:27:18,113
Did they train you for the field?

314
00:27:19,113 --> 00:27:23,083
- Yes, extensive.
- Where'd you practice before this?

315
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:25,186
What?

316
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:27,709
You are a doctor.

317
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:32,027
- So, where did you practice?
- Lab technician, 11 years with the CDC.

318
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:36,423
I was chosen to lead this team
because I am qualified to do so.

319
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,294
I got it. Thank you, doctor.

320
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:25,205
We're less than two miles to the school.
Let's hope we're not too late.

321
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:29,251
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

322
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:33,087
Those people that attacked us...
what do they want?

323
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:36,423
Get various supplies, a way back in, food.

324
00:28:36,523 --> 00:28:38,426
Are you the suburbs are as bad?

325
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:42,497
The suburbs still look nice.
Don't let that fool you.

326
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:47,259
- Did you have family here?
- My husband and my daughter.

327
00:28:49,503 --> 00:28:51,864
Did they make it out?

328
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,478
I haven't heard from them
since all of this started.

329
00:28:57,978 --> 00:29:00,277
If the outbreak had happened...

330
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:03,710
a couple of days different
on either end, I would've...

331
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,594
I should've been there.

332
00:29:07,694 --> 00:29:10,390
Two point five billion dead
and he still believes in God.

333
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,726
There's one theory you can cross off.

334
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:15,996
The rapture would've sucked
his dumb ass right up.

335
00:29:16,096 --> 00:29:18,465
Shouldn't you ask him to stop
and check for uninfected?

336
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:21,336
- We're not stopping.
- They're trying to preserve the population.

337
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:23,828
Please. Greer could give
two shits about these people.

338
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,308
We're pickin' up guinea pigs.
You really think it's conspiracy shit?

339
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:30,878
Once the docs run outta people
to try their new vaccines on,

340
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,981
they'll turn to us. Am I wrong?

341
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,284
What am I asking you for?
You don't know shit.

342
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,521
If we get back,
ask Greer about Quarantine A,

343
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:43,859
about what he plans to do with these
survivors. He'll tell you I'm right.

344
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:47,061
The only thing I'm stoppin' for is Denny's.
I am fuckin' starvin'.

345
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:51,465
- Isn't there food at the compound?
- No, not for us. We have to earn our keep.

346
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:54,503
I've hardly eaten in days,
but it could be worse.

347
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:57,173
Most of them die of starvation.

348
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,108
Not all of us live in
the first-class camp, Dr. Chase.

349
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,409
- Oh, shit. Stop the bus!
- Dude, you see somethin'?

350
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,745
Yeah. Stop the bus.

351
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:07,282
I'm gonna take a lap around the block.
Make sure this ain't no trap.

352
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:12,152
Either this bus stops moving
or you stop moving.

353
00:30:12,252 --> 00:30:15,314
Stop the bus.

354
00:31:47,332 --> 00:31:49,892
Oh, my God.

355
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,909
Sorry.

356
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:52,680
Help me! Help... help me.

357
00:32:53,315 --> 00:32:55,041
Get off.

358
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,614
- Grab her.
- Oh, my God.

359
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,947
Thanks.

360
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,219
Nice shot.

361
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:46,020
- Thanks.
- Where the hell were you?

362
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,737
I'm the only one who knows how
to drive this bitch. I ain't riskin' shit.

363
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:52,265
Did you find anything inside?

364
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:00,425
Hey...

365
00:34:00,525 --> 00:34:03,451
the school's like three blocks
from here, so...

366
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:05,853
I'm gonna keep us movin'. Cool?

367
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:07,520
Yeah.

368
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:23,397
I'm sorry about your wife.

369
00:34:24,637 --> 00:34:26,465
Have...

370
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:30,914
Have you ever...

371
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:33,541
heard of infecteds...

372
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:38,511
eating people?

373
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:41,980
No.

374
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:44,657
Why?

375
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:49,122
Did you see something?

376
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:02,835
We're here.

377
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:14,347
Shall we?

378
00:35:15,256 --> 00:35:17,450
Let's do it.

379
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,020
Open the door.

380
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,196
Fuckin' sauna in here. I can't see shit.

381
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,039
Well, it looks like nobody's home.

382
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,960
Maybe they all left.

383
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:53,646
Yes. Yes.
Yeah, somebody help me push this.

384
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:03,914
Yeah, baby. Jackpot.

385
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,929
- Oh, my God.
- Wheeler, you can't take your helmet off.

386
00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:08,535
What's it matter?
It's not like it's airborne.

387
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:11,071
We have to keep going.
We have to keep looking for survivors.

388
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:13,941
Fuck that. Don't you wanna eat?

389
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:16,109
I'll help you look.

390
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:17,778
- Yeah.
- Don't go far.

391
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:19,671
Yo!

392
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:26,536
They got raspberry.
Shit. They got steak. What?

393
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,885
Yo, can I ask you somethin'?

394
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:37,455
What you think of the doc?

395
00:38:04,691 --> 00:38:06,519
Please...

396
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:08,955
Shit.

397
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,171
I'm gonna check out a few more of
these rooms. You go ahead. I'll catch up.

398
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:19,098
Okay.

399
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:02,075
Please, pick up.

400
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:05,845
Megan? Megan, sweetheart, is that you?

401
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,549
- <i>Mom?</i>
- Hi. Hi, baby. How are you?

402
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:13,266
- <i>Mom, is that you?</i>
- Yes. Yes, it's me. I'm here.

403
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:16,389
Are you okay? Where are you?
Are you at the house?

404
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:19,851
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Why haven't you been answering?

405
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:23,756
<i>Dad said to only turn it on once a day.</i>

406
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:28,828
Where is your father? Is he there?

407
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,641
<i>He left to find help.</i>

408
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:37,017
- <i>I'm scared. Please.</i>
- I know, baby. I know you are.

409
00:40:37,117 --> 00:40:39,986
But you're doing great. Okay?
I want you to listen to me.

410
00:40:40,086 --> 00:40:41,781
I'm coming to get you.

411
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:45,351
I'm gonna be there very soon,
and I love you more than anything.

412
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:48,889
So, you stay put
and I'm gonna be there soon, okay.

413
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,384
Megan?

414
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:54,636
Megan?

415
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,658
- Shit.
- You all right?

416
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:02,269
Yeah.

417
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:04,505
<i>You call for us?</i>

418
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:06,866
I found something.

419
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,769
Let's go.

420
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:19,620
- What?
- Here.

421
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,580
All right.

422
00:41:25,324 --> 00:41:27,819
It's barricaded from the inside.

423
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:14,649
Hello?

424
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,972
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

425
00:42:24,617 --> 00:42:26,979
Where are the others?

426
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:43,563
Is... is that your child?

427
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,705
Please. Take it.

428
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:57,611
- Please take it.
- Stand back, ma'am.

429
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:00,833
- Step back.
- Put your gun down. Put it down.

430
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:03,857
It's okay. It's okay.

431
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,860
We're not gonna hurt you.
It's okay. It's okay.

432
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,595
Are there other people here with you?

433
00:43:10,195 --> 00:43:13,806
- Just take him, please. He's not infected.
- That's great.

434
00:43:14,006 --> 00:43:16,937
I'm gonna have to give him
a blood test to make sure, okay.

435
00:43:17,037 --> 00:43:19,272
But he's not infected. Take him.

436
00:43:19,372 --> 00:43:23,096
I know. Just... just put him down
right in front of you.

437
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:34,946
His name's Jeffrey.

438
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:42,796
He cries a lot, but it'll pass.

439
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:48,001
I'm sorry. I can't take him.

440
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:52,406
But... you have to. He can't stay here.

441
00:43:52,806 --> 00:43:56,443
You have children? He's all I have left.

442
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,919
- I'm so sorry. I can't take him.
- But you said you'd take him.

443
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:03,888
It's okay. We can can come back for him.
Are there other people here with you?

444
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:07,296
- But you're here now. Take him now.
- Lower your fuckin' voice.

445
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,859
- Fuck her, let's go.
- Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

446
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:14,760
- Take him.
- We have to go now.

447
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,345
Please. Take him! Take him.
Take him! Take him!

448
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:38,211
How many you kill today?
This ain't no different.

449
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,819
Let's go. Come on.
We're leaving. Let's go.

450
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:49,955
Now.

451
00:44:59,705 --> 00:45:01,256
Denise!

452
00:45:01,356 --> 00:45:04,836
- What the fuck are you doing?
- We have to finish this.

453
00:45:06,146 --> 00:45:09,784
- Help me, Gunner. Please. Please.
- All right, all right, all right.

454
00:45:09,884 --> 00:45:12,058
Move to the side. Move.

455
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,534
Holy shit.

456
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:43,442
We're too late.

457
00:45:55,594 --> 00:45:59,525
What a fuckin' waste.
You wanna check 'em, doc?

458
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,637
No. You heard Denise.

459
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:07,322
Mission's over. We should go.

460
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,678
Fuck is that?

461
00:46:22,421 --> 00:46:24,816
Run. Run.

462
00:46:29,528 --> 00:46:32,057
Get those doors closed!

463
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,962
Denise, get somethin'
to keep these doors closed.

464
00:46:43,543 --> 00:46:47,980
- Come on, goddamn it. Feel it.
- Gunner... I really do.

465
00:46:49,529 --> 00:46:53,679
All right, come on. Let's move, move, move.
We need to get to the bus now.

466
00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:55,781
Fuck this.

467
00:47:45,439 --> 00:47:47,306
We can't jump from here.
We'll break our legs.

468
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,201
I don't care. Open the window.

469
00:47:52,645 --> 00:47:54,842
- You can't open it?
- Wheeler they're nailed shut.

470
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:57,275
Move damn it. Move.

471
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:04,783
Take this. You got it?

472
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,754
Okay.

473
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:21,533
- Gunner!
- Go. I'll be right behind you. Go.

474
00:49:01,947 --> 00:49:04,108
Oh, my God.

475
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,086
- Give me the gun.
- What? No.

476
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:09,422
- Give it to me!
- Why? So you can leave us?

477
00:49:09,522 --> 00:49:14,311
- Fine. Fucking die with it.
- Wheeler? Shit.

478
00:49:16,696 --> 00:49:18,656
You okay?

479
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:24,029
Let's go.

480
00:49:29,273 --> 00:49:31,405
- Where do we go?
- I don't know.

481
00:49:31,505 --> 00:49:34,039
Come on. You'll catch your breath later.

482
00:49:41,254 --> 00:49:43,423
- You have a cellphone?
- No. Call the control center.

483
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,617
How do I do that?

484
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:50,830
Hello? Control, this is Dr. Chase, 314.

485
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,114
Is anybody there?

486
00:49:53,445 --> 00:49:56,602
Hello? This is Team 314. Is anybody there?

487
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,492
We must be outta range.

488
00:49:58,592 --> 00:50:01,407
How we gonna get back to the compound?
It's too far to walk back.

489
00:50:01,507 --> 00:50:03,843
We need to find a place to hide
until Dr. Greer sends out the next team.

490
00:50:03,943 --> 00:50:06,520
How long will that take? I can't wait.

491
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:10,484
We don't have a choice. It's almost dark.
They'll be ten times as many of them.

492
00:50:10,584 --> 00:50:13,011
Pull it together. Let's go.

493
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:28,168
Why can't we just take one of these?

494
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:31,130
Because the X's mean
the gas is sucked out.

495
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,940
- How many bullets do you have left?
- Two.

496
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,445
You might wanna save them.

497
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,156
For us.

498
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:50,516
Shit. I think someone's coming.

499
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:57,622
- The van over there.
- Okay.

500
00:51:38,603 --> 00:51:40,073
Fucking starving.

501
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:43,657
- We're moving to the next block.
- Almost gone.

502
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,158
His feet...

503
00:52:50,844 --> 00:52:53,201
I think they're gone.

504
00:52:53,301 --> 00:52:55,649
Are you all right?

505
00:52:55,749 --> 00:52:59,043
Yeah. Let's go.

506
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:38,477
What was his name again?

507
00:53:38,577 --> 00:53:41,685
Josh. He would've been eight.

508
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:46,090
I told you maybe he was lucky
not to see all this.

509
00:53:47,132 --> 00:53:51,558
That's the lie I tell myself.
I want his clothes. I want his smell.

510
00:53:51,658 --> 00:53:56,592
I want his room. I...
I want him, not this fucking picture.

511
00:53:59,344 --> 00:54:01,423
Denise,

512
00:54:01,523 --> 00:54:05,447
I spoke with my daughter. She's alive.

513
00:54:05,547 --> 00:54:08,821
Oh, my God, Lauren.
I don't know what to say.

514
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:11,558
How long do you think it will take
for them to send another team?

515
00:54:11,658 --> 00:54:13,493
Maybe a day or a week, but they will.

516
00:54:13,593 --> 00:54:15,661
- We just have to wait here together.
- What do you mean?

517
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:18,231
They're not gonna let me back into
the compound without you or the bus.

518
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:19,899
- Yes, they will.
- No, Wheeler was right.

519
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:22,502
They don't care about us. I need you.

520
00:54:22,602 --> 00:54:25,872
But I can't wait. Dr. Greer said they
were gonna stop sending teams out,

521
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:27,707
that they were gonna lock
the doors and wait it out.

522
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:30,509
No, you're a doctor.
They will come for you.

523
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:32,442
No.

524
00:54:32,642 --> 00:54:34,831
Not if they...

525
00:54:36,748 --> 00:54:38,576
What?

526
00:54:40,452 --> 00:54:42,480
Dr. Chase?

527
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:47,532
If you could get Josh back...

528
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:52,832
wouldn't you do whatever it takes
no matter the consequences?

529
00:54:52,932 --> 00:54:56,067
I can save my daughter.

530
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:59,238
I thought she was dead, but she's alive.

531
00:54:59,938 --> 00:55:04,176
And they won't... they won't be
coming for me, not if they know...

532
00:55:04,276 --> 00:55:07,606
If they know what? What?

533
00:55:12,951 --> 00:55:15,593
- Lauren?
- I'm not...

534
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:19,444
I'm not Lauren Chase.

535
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:25,499
- What do you mean?
- I came to the compound on an extraction.

536
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:27,401
I'm not a doctor.

537
00:55:27,501 --> 00:55:30,369
No, I saw you.
You were with Greer. I saw...

538
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:33,018
I stole this...

539
00:55:33,118 --> 00:55:36,285
from a doctor I found
in the street in New York.

540
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:38,753
Dr. Chase.

541
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:43,216
- My name's Rebecca Thomas.
- Why are you telling me this?

542
00:55:43,316 --> 00:55:45,818
Because I thought you should know.

543
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:48,721
I was on a business trip
when the outbreak hit

544
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:52,525
and I should've come right back, but they
told me everything was gonna be okay.

545
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,995
And I believed them.
And then they told me I couldn't leave.

546
00:55:55,095 --> 00:55:58,298
- They told me my family was gone.
- You put all of our lives in danger.

547
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,742
Gunner is dead because of you.

548
00:56:01,002 --> 00:56:03,036
How could you do this?
How could you be so selfish?

549
00:56:03,136 --> 00:56:05,205
I did everything I could
to get back into the city.

550
00:56:05,305 --> 00:56:08,541
The only way was to pretend
I was somebody else.

551
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:12,211
I lost my family once,
because I didn't do anything,

552
00:56:12,311 --> 00:56:16,350
because I trusted that someone else
would bring them back to me.

553
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:19,986
Now, I'm sorry that I lied to you...

554
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:22,656
but I need to go my family
and I need to go now.

555
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:25,659
You can't go. We don't have Gunner.
We don't have a bus.

556
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:28,161
If Josh were alive...

557
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:32,047
and you knew that he didn't have a week,

558
00:56:32,147 --> 00:56:36,702
you would go to him, you would...
you would try no matter what.

559
00:56:38,302 --> 00:56:40,472
Before when you wanted to change
the route to Sherman Oaks,

560
00:56:40,572 --> 00:56:42,990
- that's where your family is, right?
- It's close.

561
00:56:43,977 --> 00:56:48,135
- All right. I'm gonna go with you.
- You don't have to.

562
00:56:48,235 --> 00:56:51,685
No, you're right. If Josh was still alive,
I would've done the same thing.

563
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:55,653
Besides if they haven't realized
you're lying, you're my only way back.

564
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:03,402
Okay. Let's see if this place
has water and weapons.

565
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:41,151
I can't see it. Can't... Denise?

566
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,422
Where did it go? Did you see it?

567
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,751
Help me. Help me.

568
01:00:11,851 --> 01:00:13,752
- I can't see it.
- Hit it! Hit it!

569
01:00:13,852 --> 01:00:16,181
I can't. Denise?

570
01:00:23,529 --> 01:00:25,789
You came back.

571
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,859
I ain't dyin' a virgin.

572
01:00:31,436 --> 01:00:33,238
What took you so long?

573
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,166
Come here.

574
01:00:36,209 --> 01:00:38,130
Thank God.

575
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,117
First time I seen a Level 5 downtown.

576
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:47,553
If you ain't gonna trust no one else to touch
that, how bout you keep it with next time?

577
01:00:47,653 --> 01:00:51,324
- Where the hell did you go?
- I hid in a bank. Retirement plan.

578
01:00:51,424 --> 01:00:53,359
I saw y'all run up in here.
But did you talk to the doc?

579
01:00:53,459 --> 01:00:57,095
- No response from the compound.
- I'm talking about the doc here.

580
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,631
- Another team?
- No, he's locked up in some hospital.

581
01:00:59,731 --> 01:01:01,427
I told him I'd find you and call him.

582
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:04,828
He didn't even believe
I was with the team. Turn it on.

583
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:08,964
This is Dr. Chase.

584
01:01:09,064 --> 01:01:12,303
Is there a doctor out there
who spoke with my driver?

585
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:19,450
<i>Hello? Dr. Chase?</i>

586
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:23,052
Yes, Dr. Lauren Chase,
extraction team 314.

587
01:01:23,152 --> 01:01:25,491
- <i>Thank God.</i>
- Told you I wasn't lyin', motherfucker.

588
01:01:25,591 --> 01:01:28,393
<i>My name is Dr. Ward.
I have eight survivors with me.</i>

589
01:01:28,493 --> 01:01:31,361
- <i>Can you rescue us?</i>
- Ward...

590
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:34,268
- Are you the doctor from 313?
- <i>That's right.</i>

591
01:01:34,368 --> 01:01:36,832
It was his voice on the call
that Greer played me.

592
01:01:36,932 --> 01:01:40,406
We were on an extraction to Saint Mary's.
We lost our vehicle in the process.

593
01:01:40,506 --> 01:01:43,542
<i>We have one. Does your driver know
how to hotwire an ambulance?</i>

594
01:01:43,642 --> 01:01:47,040
- Fuck yeah.
- <i>Good. We're in the Presbyterian Hospital.</i>

595
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,649
<i>We'll be waiting for you
in the back entrance.</i>

596
01:01:53,219 --> 01:01:55,913
That's like three
or four blocks from here.

597
01:01:57,723 --> 01:01:59,959
You really know
how to hotwire an ambulance?

598
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:03,120
Not so bad having a felon now?

599
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:06,583
Yeah.

600
01:02:06,683 --> 01:02:09,441
Three blocks. We can run.

601
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,980
What?

602
01:02:15,573 --> 01:02:17,313
Oh, shit.

603
01:02:17,413 --> 01:02:19,144
- I was gonna say.
- What happened?

604
01:02:19,244 --> 01:02:22,064
In the bank, I saw a dude like that.
I killed him, but...

605
01:02:22,164 --> 01:02:24,258
Open it.

606
01:02:27,318 --> 01:02:29,922
- Oh, my God.
- It's not bad. I can move, but...

607
01:02:30,022 --> 01:02:33,517
- It can't be that bad yet. Stitch me up.
- She can't.

608
01:02:35,928 --> 01:02:38,024
- We lost our first-aid supplies.
- Shit.

609
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:41,400
- Then we gotta get back to the compound.
- Wheeler, they won't let you back in.

610
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,328
- Those are Greer's orders.
- We are not leaving him.

611
01:02:46,705 --> 01:02:50,176
- You came back for us. Yes?
- I'm here.

612
01:02:50,276 --> 01:02:52,711
You chose to go to the compound and work.

613
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:56,114
You could've joined one of those gangs,
but you didn't because you wanted to help.

614
01:02:56,214 --> 01:02:59,184
You wanted to help.
You want a second chance, right?

615
01:02:59,284 --> 01:03:02,087
Yeah. I do.

616
01:03:02,187 --> 01:03:04,082
Good.

617
01:03:06,124 --> 01:03:09,929
We aren't going back
to the compound, not just yet.

618
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:12,431
We're gonna go the hospital.
You're gonna get us a car.

619
01:03:12,531 --> 01:03:14,724
You're gonna drive to my house

620
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,936
- and we're gonna save my family.
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?

621
01:03:17,036 --> 01:03:19,638
My husband and my daughter,
we're gonna go get them.

622
01:03:19,738 --> 01:03:22,008
- You know about this?
- I'm going with her.

623
01:03:22,108 --> 01:03:24,714
We get my family and I will get you
back into the compound

624
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:29,301
and have you treated for the virus, but
only if you do exactly what I tell you to.

625
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:33,378
- Yes or no?
- You ain't give me a fuckin' choice.

626
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:35,588
- If I do, you're gonna fix this.
- Yes.

627
01:03:35,688 --> 01:03:39,357
- Can you?
- Level 1 infections can be treated.

628
01:03:39,457 --> 01:03:43,653
Then, yeah. Fuck yeah.
You save me, I'll save your family.

629
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:46,164
Wait. What are you doing?

630
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:48,975
You wanna make it to the hospital...

631
01:03:49,475 --> 01:03:52,523
I go ahead of you,
let you know if it's clear.

632
01:03:53,123 --> 01:03:55,428
I'm already infected, so...

633
01:03:55,528 --> 01:03:59,177
- fuck it, right?
- Are you sure about this.

634
01:03:59,277 --> 01:04:01,655
What have I got to lose?

635
01:04:28,706 --> 01:04:30,601
Shit.

636
01:04:33,845 --> 01:04:35,739
Shit.

637
01:04:38,117 --> 01:04:41,678
- They're gonna kill him.
- Get ready to run.

638
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:46,883
Wheeler?

639
01:04:54,465 --> 01:04:55,893
What's happening?

640
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:14,552
- Are you okay?
- I think I just shit my pants.

641
01:05:14,652 --> 01:05:16,320
What happened?

642
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,758
They wanted what I had,
which ain't nothin'.

643
01:05:18,858 --> 01:05:21,866
So I said I seen a bus
a couple miles back.

644
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:24,218
- I think they bought it.
- Okay.

645
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:26,599
- Are we close?
- Yeah.

646
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:29,761
- It's just around this corner.
- All right, let's go.

647
01:05:46,419 --> 01:05:48,821
- Where is Josh?
- What?

648
01:05:49,521 --> 01:05:53,634
- I can't find Josh.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

649
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:55,394
Over there.

650
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:56,862
- Come on, Denise.
- Josh...

651
01:05:56,962 --> 01:05:59,864
- Denise, come on!
- Josh.

652
01:05:59,964 --> 01:06:02,192
Come on, Denise.

653
01:06:05,803 --> 01:06:08,064
Come on, Denise.

654
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,385
Doc, she's gone. Come on. She's gone.

655
01:06:19,485 --> 01:06:21,323
Denise!

656
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:30,480
Denise! Denise!

657
01:07:32,557 --> 01:07:36,299
No. Please. Please. Please. I'm hurt.

658
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:39,929
Don't hurt me.
You're a doctor, right? Right?

659
01:07:40,029 --> 01:07:43,360
Please. Please. Please, no. No.

660
01:07:59,718 --> 01:08:02,575
It's me. It's just me.

661
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:04,947
You're all right.

662
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:15,573
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

663
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:17,811
I'm so sorry.

664
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:22,332
We gotta go, all right? Come on.

665
01:08:44,696 --> 01:08:46,889
I can't hear you!

666
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:52,004
- Are you Dr. Chase?
- Yes, I am.

667
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:55,674
- Who's he?
- This is my driver. Now let us in.

668
01:08:56,274 --> 01:08:59,978
- No, he's not. He's one of them.
- Fuck you, man. I'm the fuckin' driver.

669
01:09:00,078 --> 01:09:04,450
- He's my driver. You have my word.
- Why isn't he wearing his suit?

670
01:09:05,501 --> 01:09:09,003
- We don't have time for this right now.
- Prove to me he isn't infected, both of you.

671
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,374
- Otherwise, no one's coming in.
- Let us in.

672
01:09:11,474 --> 01:09:14,852
Okay. Wheeler, can you open my pack.

673
01:09:23,435 --> 01:09:26,137
See. I'm not infected.

674
01:09:26,237 --> 01:09:28,264
Now him.

675
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:31,903
Okay.

676
01:09:44,406 --> 01:09:47,326
He's not infected. Now let us in.

677
01:09:47,426 --> 01:09:49,953
Meet us down in the garage.

678
01:09:54,029 --> 01:09:56,501
- You can take one of those.
- This one got gas?

679
01:09:56,601 --> 01:10:00,631
Yeah. And most civilians don't even know
where the tank is on one of those things.

680
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:05,550
- Are you all from Saint Mary's?
- Yeah.

681
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:09,314
Right after I contacted the compound,
our bus was ambushed.

682
01:10:09,714 --> 01:10:13,741
My whole team perished along with the rest
of the survivors. We're all that's left.

683
01:10:13,841 --> 01:10:18,681
All right, clear out the entire cabin.
We need to fit everyone inside.

684
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:22,067
- Where's the rest of your team?
- Where the fuck do you think?

685
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,662
My apologies.

686
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:26,957
Did you hear that?

687
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,005
All right. Come on. Let's go.
Everybody inside. Let's go. Let's go.

688
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,300
After you.

689
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:44,708
- What the fuck?
- Wheeler?

690
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:48,386
- You lied to me!
- Look, Doc.

691
01:10:48,486 --> 01:10:49,989
- Who are you?
- Dr. Ward, what...

692
01:10:50,089 --> 01:10:51,456
Answer me. Who are you?

693
01:10:51,556 --> 01:10:53,962
I already told you.
I'm Dr. Lauren Chase from 314.

694
01:10:54,062 --> 01:10:56,545
I worked with Dr. Chase.
What have you done with her?

695
01:10:57,095 --> 01:10:59,030
- I...
- We were sent to bring you all back, doc.

696
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,300
- Answer the question!
- Lower your gun.

697
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,104
We are all going back
to the compound together.

698
01:11:05,204 --> 01:11:08,247
Get back. Back!

699
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:15,780
At least leave us the gun.

700
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,484
If I see you in that compound,
I will fuckin' kill you!

701
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:21,378
You're infected. You never will.

702
01:11:27,727 --> 01:11:29,540
Motherfucker!

703
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,231
I'ma kill you, you motherfucker!

704
01:11:44,777 --> 01:11:46,444
Go, go, go.

705
01:11:47,044 --> 01:11:49,306
Just one more second.

706
01:11:52,885 --> 01:11:55,579
Yes! Come on!

707
01:12:19,611 --> 01:12:21,726
You all right? All your fingers and toes?

708
01:12:21,826 --> 01:12:24,520
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good.

709
01:12:24,826 --> 01:12:27,288
Now, where we goin'?

710
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:48,006
So, what's your real name?

711
01:12:48,506 --> 01:12:53,065
- Wheeler, I can explain.
- It's cool. Takes a con to know a con.

712
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:56,187
I was onto you way before
the doc blew your cover.

713
01:12:56,614 --> 01:12:58,650
You didn't know how to use the mosquito.

714
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,285
You didn't know how to wrap
Gunner's shoulder.

715
01:13:01,385 --> 01:13:04,121
But you did fake
that blood test pretty quick.

716
01:13:04,221 --> 01:13:06,926
I met some grifters in my day,
but you're good.

717
01:13:07,026 --> 01:13:11,362
- You gonna leave me out here?
- No. Your secret's safe.

718
01:13:11,462 --> 01:13:16,034
Just tell me one thing. Where'd you
learn how to speak like a doctor?

719
01:13:16,134 --> 01:13:18,028
Thesaurus.

720
01:13:20,538 --> 01:13:23,842
Wheeler, I will get you into the compound.

721
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:25,869
I know.

722
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:30,984
So you just a mama
tryin' to get to her cubs?

723
01:13:32,184 --> 01:13:35,428
I'm Frederick. Freddie.

724
01:13:35,654 --> 01:13:37,089
Rebecca.

725
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:41,085
Let's just stick with doc.

726
01:13:44,095 --> 01:13:47,358
Up there, the one with the garden.

727
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,837
All right. I'll keep the engine runnin'.

728
01:13:51,937 --> 01:13:55,673
If you don't find what you're lookin' for,
say your goodbyes.

729
01:13:55,773 --> 01:13:58,209
It's more than most got.

730
01:13:58,709 --> 01:14:00,736
Thank you.

731
01:14:46,424 --> 01:14:48,456
Megan?

732
01:14:49,604 --> 01:14:51,662
Megan?

733
01:14:54,165 --> 01:14:56,593
Baby, are you here?

734
01:15:01,605 --> 01:15:05,642
Please, please. Please. Please. Megan?

735
01:15:06,142 --> 01:15:08,389
Megan, it's Mom.

736
01:15:10,414 --> 01:15:13,452
Megan? Oh, my God.

737
01:15:13,552 --> 01:15:15,569
Oh, my God.

738
01:15:16,088 --> 01:15:19,183
Megan? Megan?

739
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:23,261
- Stay...
- No, baby.

740
01:15:23,361 --> 01:15:25,797
Baby, it's me. It's me.

741
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:27,700
Mom?

742
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,205
Come here.

743
01:15:30,991 --> 01:15:33,705
Come here. Come here, sweet...

744
01:15:33,805 --> 01:15:36,175
Mommy, you came.

745
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:39,310
- You're okay.
- You came.

746
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:43,371
Of course, I came for you. I told you
I was gonna come for you, didn't I?

747
01:15:44,181 --> 01:15:46,676
Of course, I came.

748
01:15:47,519 --> 01:15:49,536
I love you so much.

749
01:15:53,657 --> 01:15:57,600
- Megan, where's Dad?
- He's still not back.

750
01:15:59,663 --> 01:16:01,900
It's just me.

751
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,902
It's us now, okay.

752
01:16:04,002 --> 01:16:06,988
- Are we leaving?
- Yes. We have a ride out front.

753
01:16:07,538 --> 01:16:11,935
I have something for you. Eat this slowly.

754
01:16:16,413 --> 01:16:19,575
I'm gonna be right back, okay. Stay here.

755
01:16:39,603 --> 01:16:42,807
Baby? Megan?

756
01:16:43,207 --> 01:16:45,668
Tilt your head back a little bit.

757
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,238
It's just a little bit of water.

758
01:16:54,352 --> 01:16:55,920
What's that?

759
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:59,463
It's nothing to be nervous about.
I just need to check your blood.

760
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:00,884
Hold my hand.

761
01:17:13,137 --> 01:17:15,197
Am I sick?

762
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,709
No.

763
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:22,815
No, you're not infected.
You're gonna be fine.

764
01:17:22,915 --> 01:17:24,982
- I am?
- Yes. Everything is gonna be fine.

765
01:17:25,082 --> 01:17:27,652
No... I thought for sure that...

766
01:17:27,752 --> 01:17:31,689
Baby, you haven't eaten in so long.
Of course you feel sick.

767
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:35,959
I'm gonna go to the garage,
I need to grab a few things.

768
01:17:36,059 --> 01:17:39,689
And when I come back,
we're gonna go the safe zone, okay?

769
01:18:53,003 --> 01:18:54,872
No.

770
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,767
Oh, God, David.

771
01:19:13,191 --> 01:19:16,053
<i>My name is David Thomas.</i>

772
01:19:17,662 --> 01:19:20,664
<i>I've locked myself in here
to protect my daughter.</i>

773
01:19:20,764 --> 01:19:24,402
<i>Whoever you are, please save her.</i>

774
01:19:24,502 --> 01:19:27,021
<i>My wife is Rebecca Thomas.</i>

775
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:29,349
<i>If you find her...</i>

776
01:19:34,745 --> 01:19:37,039
<i>tell her I love her.</i>

777
01:19:41,418 --> 01:19:43,745
<i>And that I'm sorry.</i>

778
01:19:45,044 --> 01:19:46,580
<i>Goodbye.</i>

779
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,650
David.

780
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,617
I'm so sorry.

781
01:19:50,717 --> 01:19:52,763
Megan's alive.

782
01:19:52,863 --> 01:19:55,258
And if she's only Level 1, I can...

783
01:19:58,036 --> 01:20:00,834
I will save...

784
01:20:00,934 --> 01:20:03,025
our daughter.

785
01:20:19,656 --> 01:20:21,651
Fuck me.

786
01:20:26,497 --> 01:20:29,492
Megan, I've gotta check something
by the window, okay?

787
01:20:32,386 --> 01:20:34,313
Level 5's.

788
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,433
What's that sound?

789
01:20:42,113 --> 01:20:44,048
- What are you doing?
- You need to put this on.

790
01:20:44,148 --> 01:20:47,309
- What about you?
- Megan, trust me.

791
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:57,921
Here, let me help you.
Get down. Put your feet in first.

792
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:04,802
- We're gonna have to run, okay.
- Mom... I love you.

793
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:07,157
Megan, I love you more than anything.

794
01:21:07,257 --> 01:21:09,793
We're gonna be fine. Let's go.

795
01:21:13,978 --> 01:21:17,022
We're almost there. We're almost there.

796
01:21:18,315 --> 01:21:21,488
- Mom? Mom?
- Run, Megan! Run!

797
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,522
Mom? Mom?

798
01:21:24,622 --> 01:21:27,955
Go. Go, Megan. Up the stairs. Go upstairs.

799
01:21:30,194 --> 01:21:32,897
- Go, Wheeler, go.
- Go, go.

800
01:21:34,397 --> 01:21:36,291
Mom!

801
01:21:37,902 --> 01:21:40,345
Megan, run! Run!

802
01:21:43,441 --> 01:21:46,369
Wheeler! Go, Megan.

803
01:21:51,783 --> 01:21:54,485
- Fuck. There's too many.
- Okay. Okay. Open the door.

804
01:21:54,585 --> 01:21:57,212
- What?
- Just do it. Trust me.

805
01:22:00,191 --> 01:22:03,253
Go to the window. Megan, open the window!

806
01:22:04,228 --> 01:22:05,529
Go!

807
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,800
- You have to come with us!
- I know. Fuckin' jump!

808
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,494
Come on, Megan. Come on.

809
01:22:38,963 --> 01:22:40,766
He's hurt.

810
01:22:42,066 --> 01:22:44,504
Help me. We gotta get him
to the front yard.

811
01:22:44,604 --> 01:22:46,738
Come on... Get up.

812
01:22:46,838 --> 01:22:49,840
- I can't.
- Get up.

813
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:52,415
No, I'm good.

814
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:57,548
No more hero shit. Just get your girl.

815
01:22:57,848 --> 01:23:00,251
I'm so sorry, Freddie.

816
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:02,987
- Run! Run!
- Go. Come on.

817
01:23:03,087 --> 01:23:06,382
No. Run. Run.

818
01:23:07,057 --> 01:23:09,886
It's okay. It's okay. Go.

819
01:23:10,628 --> 01:23:12,122
It's okay.

820
01:23:19,102 --> 01:23:22,487
Get in, Megan. Get in. Get in.
Lock the door. Lock the door.

821
01:23:43,828 --> 01:23:46,400
Baby, it's okay. They're gone.

822
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:49,314
It's behind us. They're gone.

823
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:30,007
Megan? Megan, look at me.
Keep your eyes open, baby.

824
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:33,044
Open your eyes. We're almost there.

825
01:24:33,144 --> 01:24:35,797
Megan? Megan, stay with me.

826
01:24:36,347 --> 01:24:39,142
Megan? Megan, please.

827
01:24:56,534 --> 01:24:58,412
Lord.

828
01:24:58,912 --> 01:25:00,927
It's okay.

829
01:25:05,909 --> 01:25:07,969
There it is.

830
01:25:37,309 --> 01:25:41,621
Megan, come on, baby.
We have to get out. Okay? Hold on to me.

831
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:48,610
Talk to me.

832
01:25:51,755 --> 01:25:55,143
Megan? Get up. Get up. Get up.

833
01:25:57,961 --> 01:25:59,790
Megan.

834
01:26:04,968 --> 01:26:08,973
Don't shoot. Please. Please. Don't shoot.

835
01:26:09,073 --> 01:26:11,467
I'm Dr. Lauren Chase. Please.

836
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:20,519
It's okay. Please.

837
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:24,027
Get up here now!

838
01:26:32,914 --> 01:26:34,940
I love you.

839
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:55,787
We have an unconscious...
in the rear of the compound.

840
01:26:55,887 --> 01:26:58,990
- <i>What's the code on the suit?</i>
- 730-A.

841
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,538
- <i>Goddamn it. Are you sure?</i>
- 10-4.

842
01:27:01,638 --> 01:27:06,126
Okay, that's Dr. Chase. I need an evac at
the back entrance now! Is she still alive?

843
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:09,067
She's unconscious, sir.
I think she's infected.

844
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:11,169
Bring her to Quarantine A,
prep her for treatment.

845
01:27:11,269 --> 01:27:14,171
Orders are to keep all infected
outside of the compound.

846
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,774
<i>I give the orders.
She's the last of the CDC.</i>

847
01:27:16,874 --> 01:27:19,086
Bring her to Quarantine A!

848
01:27:19,186 --> 01:27:21,737
Yes, sir. Bringing her in.

849
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,681
Come on.

850
01:27:23,781 --> 01:27:26,142
Let's move. Let's go.

851
01:27:27,305 --> 01:28:27,479
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
