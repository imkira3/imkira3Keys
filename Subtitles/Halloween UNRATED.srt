2
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:06,340
Come on, sweetie pie.

3
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,978
Morning, Elvis.
You're a pretty Elvis, aren't you?

4
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:17,019
Yes, you are.

5
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:20,552
Jesus Christ, Ronnie, you know
I have to fucking work tonight.

6
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:22,289
Somebody around here
has got to make some money.

7
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,494
I'm all broken up here, bitch.
I can't work.

8
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:27,936
- Yeah, and whose fault is that?
- Fuck you.

9
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,269
Oh, my God, you're pathetic.

10
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,536
You know that new waitress
over at the Bingo Lounge?

11
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:34,841
She's been giving me the freaky eye.

12
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:37,313
Oh, the whore with the big tits
hanging down to her knees?

13
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:38,576
Maybe I'll choke the chicken,

14
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,141
purge my snorkel
all over them flappy-ass tits.

15
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:42,481
Good. Well, have
a good fucking time.

16
00:01:42,554 --> 00:01:43,816
- I will.
- I hope she likes cripples.

17
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:48,019
Bitch, I will crawl over there,
and I will skull fuck the shit outta you!

18
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:50,186
Oh, I'll get the crutches for you.

19
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:54,733
See what you did?
Fucking loudmouth.

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,789
Waah! Waah!

21
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:57,563
That's all that fucker does is cry.

22
00:01:57,637 --> 00:01:59,537
Waah! Waah!

23
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:02,068
Cry and shit. Cry and shit.

24
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:04,041
Just like you.
That's all you do is cry and shit.

25
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,340
Fuck you and set it
on my pole right now, bitch.

26
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:08,039
Fuck off.

27
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:15,880
Mom?

28
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:21,017
Can't you see I'm making eggs over here?

29
00:02:21,094 --> 00:02:22,561
I'll pass.

30
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,687
Since when?

31
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:27,097
Since now. They're chicken abortions,
and they're fucking gross.

32
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,998
They are not chicken abortions.

33
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,764
Like you know what an abortion is.

34
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:34,402
You know what, can you please
go upstairs and get your brother?

35
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:36,403
Why do I always have to do it?

36
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:37,671
Just do it!

37
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:43,173
Don't you give me that look!

38
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:46,186
Man, that bitch got herself
a nice little dumper.

39
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:50,084
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.

40
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,321
No, say it again, Ronnie!
Say it to my face!

41
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:56,922
Oh, what's the matter?
You jealous of your own daughter's ass?

42
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,160
- Fucking pig.
- Aah!

43
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:00,827
You fucking whore!

44
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:04,562
All right, now clean it up!

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,164
- Go on.
- I'm not gonna do this anymore!

46
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,505
Michael.

47
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:11,808
Stop jerking off in there.

48
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:13,178
Get away!

49
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,343
Hey! Get your ass downstairs

50
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,283
and wash your hands, you little shit.

51
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:20,881
I'm not listening!
Aaaahhh!

52
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:22,185
Let me tell you something.

53
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:24,420
That freak of yours,
he needs some serious discipline.

54
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,485
I mean, he runs around like a little bitch.

55
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:28,463
You leave him alone.
Keep your hands off him.

56
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:31,762
Give me a fucking break.
He's probably a queer.

57
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,134
He's gonna grow up,
end up cutting his dick and balls off

58
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:36,036
and changing his name to Michelle.

59
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,971
There he is.
Good morning, Michelle, ma belle.

60
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:42,012
What the hell took you two so long?

61
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,980
Elvis died. I had to flush him.

62
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:47,517
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

63
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:49,746
We'll get you a new one
after school, okay?

64
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,083
Okay.

65
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:54,091
What'd you do to him,
stroke him to death?

66
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,649
Uh, Elvis.

67
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:58,423
Elvis! Uh! Uh! Uh!

68
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:00,362
You know what?
It's a fucking rat.

69
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,229
Who pays money for a fucking rat?

70
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:04,098
I mean, it's a goddamn rat, man.

71
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,500
Morning, Boo.

72
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,038
"Morning, Boo. "

73
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:13,075
Take that damn thing off.

74
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:18,950
You are starting to annoy me, boy.

75
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:20,042
I hate you.

76
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,110
And I hate you, too. You see this?

77
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:25,055
As soon as this heals,
I'm gonna break it again on your fucking face!

78
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:27,592
Enough, all right?
Can we just eat in peace for once?

79
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,337
What a fucking pussy, dude.
I told you he wouldn't fight.

80
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:43,399
He's all fucking talk.
I was like- We were fighting, right?

81
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:46,139
You were there. He was like,
"I'm not gonna fight you. " I was like-

82
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:47,407
Yes!

83
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,248
I know where he lives.

84
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:52,548
- You want to egg his house?
- We can totally do that.

85
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,746
- Yeah.
- Oh.

86
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:55,722
Hey, shit-pants.

87
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,281
What's going on? You know, um...

88
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,921
I heard your sister got caught
selling blow jobs in the bathroom.

89
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:06,990
I heard they had to pump the cum
out of her stomach.

90
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:10,634
Hey, Mikey, how's your mom doing?

91
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:13,869
You know, my old man said that for a buck
she'd rub her tits on his face.

92
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:15,535
Shut up.

93
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,942
What the fuck did you say, faggot?

94
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:19,776
- Mikey's upset.
- Look how tough he is.

95
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:23,615
Hey, ball-licker, check this out.

96
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:27,679
I was thinking of making copies of Mommy
for the whole school.

97
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:30,386
- Fuck you.
- Hey! Tough guy!

98
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,920
Think she'd suck my dick for a quarter
and let me suck her tits?

99
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:38,764
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Don't fucking yell in my face, you bitch!

100
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:43,166
Fuck off!

101
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,265
What the hell is going on here?

102
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:46,331
Break it up!

103
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,809
I said break it up!

104
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,404
You over there,
you over there, you there.

105
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:52,813
- He started it.
- Shut up!

106
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:53,942
Fuck you.

107
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:57,579
What did you say, son?

108
00:05:57,655 --> 00:06:00,317
I said fuck you.

109
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:02,520
Fuck me?

110
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,919
Come here.
Come here.

111
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,363
- My bag!
- Grab it!

112
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,599
Again? Again? Jesus, what is it with you
and this goddamn school?

113
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,366
I cannot keep coming down here like this.

114
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,465
Look, Miss Myers,

115
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,808
I do not enjoy calling you down here
every five minutes.

116
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,177
Really?
It sure seems like you fucking do.

117
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:25,341
Can't you get control
over your school, principal?

118
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:28,682
Yes, I can get control.
I can control my school.

119
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,553
There's something you gotta know.

120
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,290
Will you just relax a moment?
Please sit down and let me talk to you.

121
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,561
- Please. Please.
- Okay. What?

122
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,694
Please, sit down.

123
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,604
- Thank God.
- Hi, Jim. How are you?

124
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,699
Is this her?

125
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,541
Miss Myers, this is Dr. Loomis.
I took the liberty of calling him in.

126
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,075
- Happens to be a child psychologist-
- Thank you, Jim.

127
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,447
Psychologist?

128
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,849
May I ask you,

129
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,252
has your son ever had any kind
of serious psychiatric evaluation?

130
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:04,791
Okay, I've had enough.
This is crazy.

131
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,521
- Miss Myers, please.
- I gotta get back to work.

132
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:08,062
- I gotta go.
- Please, ma'am.

133
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,893
We only want the best for the child.
Please don't take offense.

134
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,558
Please, sit down. Sit down.

135
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:13,658
Thank you.

136
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:16,397
Look, uh, Miss Myers...

137
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,132
we found this...

138
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:20,003
in Michael's school bag.

139
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:24,411
Come on. Big deal.
He found a dead cat.

140
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:27,813
And these.

141
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:30,375
What is that?

142
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,614
I hope you're not squeamish, Mrs. Myers.

143
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:35,987
Oh, God.

144
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:38,026
Oh, this is really sick.

145
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:41,955
Are you saying Michael did this?

146
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,057
Michael loves animals. He-

147
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:49,271
Why would he do this?

148
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:54,834
Mrs. Myers, typically the thrill of hurting
or causing pain to smaller creatures,

149
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:57,346
it's often an early warning sign.

150
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:58,972
Early warning sign for what?

151
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:03,813
For much deeper and bigger problems.

152
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:06,220
What do you mean problems?
What is this?

153
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,953
He's a very disturbed young man.

154
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:12,861
I have to evaluate him,
and I'd like to interview him.

155
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:15,832
I need to take him
through a series of tests.

156
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,527
Well, you can talk to him,
but what does-

157
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:19,331
what does evaluating him-
what does that mean?

158
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:23,500
Obviously, he's a very deranged
young mind that can do this to his pets.

159
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:25,544
You don't know that he did that.

160
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:31,246
Fuck, man, if I get one more fucking detention,
I'll be fucking expelled.

161
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:32,716
My old man's gonna beat my ass.

162
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,777
We gotta get that piece of shit
on the weekend so we don't get in trouble.

163
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:37,879
Dude, if I see that Myers pussy,
he's fucking dead.

164
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,829
You want it?

165
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:56,432
Huh? Do you want it?

166
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,549
Aah!

167
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,143
Ow!

168
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:43,590
What the fuck?

169
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,424
Oh, you're so fucking dead.

170
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:53,895
Oh, please stop.

171
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,028
Stop!

172
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:12,813
Please.

173
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:25,998
Please.
Please no!

174
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:27,629
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:33,077
Don't hurt me. Just- I'm sorry.

176
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:39,008
No, no, no, don't.
Don't. Please. Please.

177
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,353
Please.

178
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:52,158
Don't hurt me.

179
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:03,835
No.

180
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:00,299
Hey, clown.

181
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,768
Hey.

182
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:07,005
Psycho boy.

183
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:08,668
Cat killer.

184
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:13,612
Do you really torture and kill
all them worthless animals, boy?

185
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:20,150
Make you feel like a real bad-ass
motherfucker killer, huh?

186
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:23,159
That is some deep-ass,

187
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:26,685
serious, faggoty-ass shit, man.

188
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:28,732
Judith, I'm gonna be late!

189
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,462
"Judith, I'm gonna be late!"

190
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,232
You really are a whiny little bitch,
you know that?

191
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,933
Ronnie, knock it off.

192
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,544
Ma, Judith is wasting all my time.

193
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:46,516
I really shouldn't even let you go
after that shit you pulled today at school.

194
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:48,212
Oh, Ma, please?

195
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:50,254
All right, Michael, calm down.

196
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:51,721
Tomorrow things are gonna change
around here,

197
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,417
so I suggest you live it up tonight.

198
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:56,751
Judith!

199
00:12:57,997 --> 00:12:59,055
Here.

200
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:03,592
What?

201
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:05,796
Would you do me a favor and please
take your brother trick-or-treating?

202
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:09,137
Why don't you have that subhuman sloth
over there on the couch do it?

203
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,200
You know, if I could get that lazy drunk
off his fat ass, I would.

204
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:16,908
Bitch, if you don't think I ain't making
a mental list of all your fucking bullshit!

205
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:20,519
Sweetie, look at me.

206
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:22,350
I know things have been bad,

207
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:25,050
but tomorrow we start to make
everything better, okay?

208
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:28,627
Yeah.

209
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:31,994
I like your hair curly.
It looks pretty.

210
00:13:32,065 --> 00:13:35,398
Thanks, sweetie.
Have fun trick-or-treating, okay?

211
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,903
Don't eat too much candy.

212
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:38,131
Hey, Mrs. Myers.

213
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:39,764
I want you out by 11.

214
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:42,036
- What'd I do?
- I know what you do.

215
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,441
Whatever.

216
00:13:45,146 --> 00:13:47,205
What about trick-or-treating?

217
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:49,216
Are you kidding me?
Go by yourself.

218
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:51,548
Aren't you too old for that, anyway?

219
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:52,608
Whatever.

220
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:54,552
Sorry, squirt, but have fun.

221
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:56,613
Trick or treat!

222
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:17,078
# Love hurts #

223
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,173
# Love scars #

224
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,219
# Love wounds #

225
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:25,584
# And marks #

226
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:29,421
# Any heart #

227
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:32,427
# Not tough #

228
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:35,396
# Or strong #

229
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,457
# Enough #

230
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:40,698
# To take a lot of pain #

231
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:43,569
# Take a lot of pain #

232
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:46,439
# Love is like a cloud #

233
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,207
# Holds a lot of rain #

234
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:53,614
# Love hurts #

235
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:59,146
# Ooh, ooh, love hurts #

236
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:12,668
What if your dad hears us?

237
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:16,065
Hold up, man.

238
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:19,804
That fucking drunk-prick fuck Ronnie
ain't my dad.

239
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,938
Okay, I- I didn't know.

240
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:24,176
My daddy's in heaven, okay?

241
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,150
Okay.

242
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:28,653
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:30,188
Close your eyes.

244
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,553
Keep them closed, all right?

245
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,765
I got a surprise for you.

246
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:44,928
Open.

247
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,030
Aaarrrgghhh!

248
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:50,008
Aaahh!

249
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:51,635
- Wow.
- What?

250
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:53,009
Take that stupid thing off.

251
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:55,845
Oh, come on, babe.
I want to do it with the mask on.

252
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:28,099
Uhh!

253
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:41,482
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

254
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:13,872
Steve, stop it.

255
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:16,974
Stop.

256
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,210
Once a night is enough.

257
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:20,219
Stop it.

258
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,222
Michael?

259
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:26,786
Michael, what the fuck
are you doing in here?

260
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:28,886
Answer me.
Michael.

261
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,692
Michael!

262
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:31,754
Answer me!

263
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,768
What the fuck-
Michael!

264
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,133
Answer-

265
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:26,779
Happy Halloween, Boo.

266
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:51,372
Jesus, what the hell happened now?

267
00:24:54,682 --> 00:24:57,014
Sweetie, what are you doing out here?

268
00:24:58,419 --> 00:24:59,784
It's freezing.

269
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,482
Michael, what's going on?

270
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:05,051
Michael, answer me.

271
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:08,729
Give me the baby.

272
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:11,929
Michael, what is going on?

273
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,366
Answer me.

274
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:30,583
...in connection
with tonight's brutal murders.

275
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,649
...the Myers family,

276
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:39,786
and was described by police
as Manson-like in its viciousness,

277
00:25:39,864 --> 00:25:43,664
and more horrific than anything
Hollywood could imagine.

278
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,867
Judith Myers' nude body
was found lying face-down

279
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:51,373
in a pool of blood in an upstairs hallway.

280
00:25:51,442 --> 00:25:54,468
Apparently she had been stabbed 17 times.

281
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:59,414
Her boyfriend Steven Haley's body
was found in the kitchen downstairs,

282
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:03,978
the victim of an apparent vicious beating
with an aluminum baseball bat.

283
00:26:04,056 --> 00:26:05,250
Along with Myers and Haley,

284
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:07,291
a third victim, Ronnie White,

285
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,156
who was found bound to a chair,

286
00:26:09,227 --> 00:26:12,253
White's neck slit wide open
with a kitchen knife

287
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,493
and stabbed numerous times
in the face and chest.

288
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:18,968
Of course we'll have much more
on this horrific story as it develops.

289
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,802
But for now,
three people brutally murdered,

290
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:26,072
and a 10-year-old boy, Michael Myers,
being held in custody.

291
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:50,868
I'm standing outside
Smith's Grove Sanitarium

292
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:52,269
where late last night,

293
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:55,069
10-year-old Michael Myers was transferred

294
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:57,337
after being found guilty
of first-degree murder.

295
00:26:57,412 --> 00:27:00,006
Myers' verdict comes
after one of the lengthiest

296
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:02,675
and most expensive trials
in the state's history.

297
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:06,152
In attendance during this trial,
Dr. Samuel Loomis.

298
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:08,621
Loomis has now been appointed
by Judge Masterson

299
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,524
to oversee Myers' care
while incarcerated here at Smith's Grove.

300
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:15,353
Hello, hello, hello.

301
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:17,058
Can you talk in there?

302
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:18,498
Hi, I'm Michael Myers.

303
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:19,864
Okay, okay. That's fine.

304
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:22,870
That's good. That's good.
Okay, we're on.

305
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:24,735
How are you feeling today?

306
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:25,796
Good.

307
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,176
Could I ask you something?

308
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:32,441
You can ask me
whatever you want.

309
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:33,982
That's why I'm here.

310
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:37,485
If you have anything on your mind,
feel free- anything.

311
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:39,021
Okay.

312
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,216
Why do you talk so funny?

313
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:43,317
Talk so funny?

314
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:47,329
Tell me, Michael,

315
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:49,888
what do you remember about...

316
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:52,161
that night, Halloween?

317
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:57,572
What do you mean,
like my costume and candy?

318
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,911
So you remember nothing
about the killing?

319
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:06,879
You remember nothing
about getting a knife?

320
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,480
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, okay.

321
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,853
But you were covered in blood.
Whose blood was it?

322
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,084
I don't know.

323
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,660
Case: Michael Myers.

324
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:21,688
To the untrained eye,
there's nothing visually abnormal

325
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:26,136
with this angelic young boy,
but one must remember not to be fooled

326
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,436
by his calm, unassuming facade.

327
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,203
Can I go home today?

328
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,369
No, not today.

329
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,276
Tomorrow?

330
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:38,146
I don't know.
I have to talk to the doctor about that.

331
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,884
- Hey, Mommy.
- Yeah.

332
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:46,323
Is everyone at home okay?

333
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,825
Everything's okay at home.

334
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,328
Okay.

335
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:25,922
Hey, Mikey.

336
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:27,593
How you doing?

337
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,936
Look, you can't let those walls
get you down.

338
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:34,977
Believe me, I know.

339
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:36,944
I spent a little time behind walls.

340
00:29:38,381 --> 00:29:41,145
I know they can drive you crazy.

341
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:43,117
You gotta look beyond the walls.

342
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:46,916
You know,
learn to live inside your head.

343
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:49,856
Hey, there's no walls
that can stop you there.

344
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:53,961
All right, I gotta get back to work.

345
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:55,828
Now you take it easy, Mikey.

346
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:06,767
Look at my mask.

347
00:30:07,878 --> 00:30:10,369
Oh, wow. Beautiful. Yeah.

348
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:13,682
Why is it all black?

349
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:15,914
'Cause it's one of my favorite colors.

350
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:18,547
Well, actually black isn't a color, is it?

351
00:30:18,623 --> 00:30:20,523
It's the absence of color.

352
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:23,082
In the spectrum of colors,

353
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:25,561
you go from black,
which is no color,

354
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,463
all the way through to white,

355
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,398
which is every color.

356
00:30:31,837 --> 00:30:33,634
So technically-

357
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,369
not that it really matters-
but black isn't a color.

358
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:40,268
Why did you make it?

359
00:30:40,346 --> 00:30:41,608
I have my secrets.

360
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,080
Wait a minute.

361
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:47,380
I thought we had no secrets,
you and I.

362
00:30:47,453 --> 00:30:48,715
Because no one sees me.

363
00:30:48,787 --> 00:30:50,778
Yes, they do.
I see you every day.

364
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:54,258
Your mom, she comes every week.

365
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:57,023
Anybody else?

366
00:30:58,431 --> 00:30:59,420
No.

367
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:01,626
Michael has begun to obsess

368
00:31:01,701 --> 00:31:05,000
on the construction
of these primitive masks.

369
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,539
It is the rare occasion
that he will allow himself

370
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:09,438
to be seen without one of these.

371
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:11,704
Only during the weekly visits
from his mother

372
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:15,806
does he show brief glimpses of the boy
he once may have been.

373
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,256
Do you like my mask?

374
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,223
When did you make this?

375
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:31,788
Just yesterday.

376
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:36,565
I like the mask because it hides my face.

377
00:31:38,173 --> 00:31:40,403
I don't like you to hide your face.

378
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:41,942
Take it off.

379
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,807
It hides my ugliness.

380
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,039
Sweetie, don't say that.
Take it off.

381
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,605
You're not ugly.

382
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:51,848
Don't talk like that, okay?

383
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:53,183
Okay.

384
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:57,890
I miss you so much.

385
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,484
I miss you, too.

386
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:20,679
Michael's so-called normal moments

387
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:22,184
are becoming fewer and fewer,

388
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:24,584
and I'm particularly worried about this.

389
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:29,251
I believe that these masks have
begun to create a mental sanctuary

390
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:33,855
in which Michael can hide
within himself and from himself.

391
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:39,993
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly,
Fa la la la la, la la la la #

392
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,938
Fuck you! Fuck you all!

393
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:44,702
- I hate you!
- Let it out!

394
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:46,368
Shut the fuck up!

395
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,344
I gotta get out of here.

396
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:51,645
Just let me out!
I hate this world!

397
00:32:51,717 --> 00:32:54,379
- I don't want to be here anymore.
- I know. It's okay.

398
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:56,648
- I just want to go home.
- It's okay. It's okay.

399
00:32:56,722 --> 00:32:57,950
It's okay.

400
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:01,355
Why can't I just go home?

401
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:02,758
Okay.

402
00:33:02,828 --> 00:33:05,228
Okay. Okay. Okay.

403
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:06,821
I'm afraid you can't go home.

404
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,833
Why?

405
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,597
Because you've done terrible things.

406
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:16,606
Come here. Come on.

407
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:20,679
It's okay. It's okay, Michael.

408
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:22,510
Michael's downward slide

409
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:25,312
into this hellish abyss continues.

410
00:33:25,385 --> 00:33:29,048
I fear he's on the verge
of completely shutting down.

411
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:33,059
I managed to persuade the suits
to let you come outside

412
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,890
and sit out in the garden.

413
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:36,896
All right, gardens.

414
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:41,298
Hardly a charming place,
but at least there's a bit of greenery.

415
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:44,338
But please, I mean,
if you don't communicate with me,

416
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:46,168
how can I help you?

417
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,232
I'm here to help you.

418
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,211
I feel an utter failure at the moment,

419
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,147
that I just can't get through to you.

420
00:33:54,216 --> 00:33:56,946
And you know, they're going
to see in my reports

421
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:59,249
that you're not responding, and-

422
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:01,516
you know, they may
take me off the case.

423
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,387
I don't know. I hope not.

424
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,291
I need to get out of here.

425
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:11,294
Yes, that's not going to happen
for a while, Michael.

426
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:17,406
Michael, take off the mask.

427
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:23,337
Honey, you don't look good.
You have to eat. Come on.

428
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:27,714
- Put my mask back on.
- Michael.

429
00:34:27,785 --> 00:34:29,912
Please put my mask back on.

430
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:35,215
Come on.
Let's try to enjoy the day.

431
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:38,495
The child christened Michael Myers

432
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:40,655
has become a sort of ghost,

433
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:44,030
a mere shape of a human being.

434
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:46,262
There's nothing left here now.

435
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:14,763
Well, before I go,
I brought you something.

436
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,733
I found it. I thought you might like
to hang it up in your room.

437
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:23,832
I thought you'd like it.

438
00:35:34,321 --> 00:35:35,982
Well, I guess I'll see you next week.

439
00:35:36,056 --> 00:35:37,648
I'll walk you to the car.

440
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:43,127
Bye, sweetie.

441
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:48,001
Nurse, sit with Michael.
I'm taking Mrs. Myers to her car.

442
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:49,764
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

443
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:03,840
Cute baby.

444
00:36:08,857 --> 00:36:10,848
Couldn't be related to you.

445
00:36:23,073 --> 00:36:26,474
You know, he's been silent now
for two weeks almost.

446
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:30,104
We really may want to consider
maybe shock treatments.

447
00:36:37,954 --> 00:36:39,649
What happened?
What happened?

448
00:36:39,723 --> 00:36:41,088
What happened there?

449
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,181
Hey!

450
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,382
So you don't fucking talk a lot,
do you, Max?

451
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,858
Goddamn it, we're gonna get
one thing straight.

452
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:51,553
I don't work for you.

453
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:53,755
You may have worked here
for many years

454
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,161
and done all manner of things,

455
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,530
and I suppose that's because
you're a hard worker.

456
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,364
Most of you people are.

457
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,564
All your women keep
your little bungalows clean,

458
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,539
sweep off the dirt floors-

459
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,473
keep the papooses in order and all-

460
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,602
but I'm my own boss, all right?

461
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,977
I retire in about three months,

462
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,573
and you're still gonna be here
for a long time.

463
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,585
Now open the door.

464
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,417
Don't take no orders from anybody.

465
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,396
Let's go, fuck-nut. Time to go.

466
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:35,496
- Hey! Don't touch those.
- What?

467
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,872
He doesn't like it
when you touch the masks.

468
00:39:37,944 --> 00:39:40,469
God damn, I wouldn't want
the bum to freak out.

469
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,879
Sorry about these chains, Mikey.

470
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:45,474
What do you mean,
you're sorry about these chains?

471
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,782
You got feelings for this big idiot,
is that what it is?

472
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:50,755
What's the dig goin' on, Ismael?
What the fuck, man?

473
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:54,725
You know what? I've been taking care
of this kid for almost 20 years.

474
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:56,421
And me and him-

475
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:58,123
You know what? Never mind.
Just shut up, man.

476
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:00,132
Just keep your hands off his things.

477
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,633
Don't look at me.

478
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:05,194
I'll be a shitstorm
in your worst nightmare, motherfucker.

479
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:08,400
I'll come in here and fuck this place up
one night, you watch.

480
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:21,448
I really don't know what else to say, Michael.

481
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:25,789
You haven't said a word for 15 years.

482
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,727
Christ, that's a lifetime.

483
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:35,129
That's nearly twice as long
as my first marriage.

484
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:37,330
Wow.

485
00:40:37,406 --> 00:40:39,203
It's strange, Michael.

486
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:44,339
In a weird way, you've become like...

487
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:48,006
...like my best friend.

488
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:53,153
It just shows you how fucked up my life is.

489
00:40:55,324 --> 00:40:58,691
I've done all I possibly can for you.

490
00:40:58,762 --> 00:41:02,493
So I'm sorry to tell you

491
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:05,194
that this is going to be my last day.

492
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:07,395
Michael...

493
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:08,801
I have to move on.

494
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:12,669
I'm sorry.

495
00:41:28,826 --> 00:41:30,794
Take care, Michael.

496
00:41:34,098 --> 00:41:35,725
Take care.

497
00:41:58,525 --> 00:42:00,891
These eyes will deceive you.

498
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,130
They will destroy you.

499
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:09,896
They will take from you your innocence...

500
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:12,199
your pride...

501
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:15,400
and eventually your soul.

502
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:20,641
These eyes do not see
what you and I see.

503
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:27,681
Behind these eyes
one finds only blackness,

504
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:30,747
the absence of light.

505
00:42:30,825 --> 00:42:35,023
These are the eyes...

506
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:37,759
of a psychopath.

507
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,733
Michael was created

508
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:41,996
by a perfect alignment

509
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,233
of interior and exterior factors

510
00:42:45,307 --> 00:42:47,901
gone violently wrong-

511
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:52,743
a perfect storm, if you will.

512
00:42:52,815 --> 00:42:55,511
Thus creating a psychopath

513
00:42:55,585 --> 00:42:58,315
that knows no boundaries...

514
00:42:58,387 --> 00:43:01,413
and has no boundaries.

515
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:10,795
Kendall, I really don't appreciate

516
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:12,630
being called out of
my favorite watering hole

517
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:15,001
to come down on
the fuckin' graveyard shift.

518
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:17,870
If you do me dirt on this one,
I'll fuckin' hold it against you.

519
00:43:17,941 --> 00:43:20,136
Hey, you know what? I'll fuck her.
You don't want to fuck her?

520
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,235
I'll fuck her. Right here.

521
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:30,547
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

522
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:33,112
Here we go.
I want you to meet Cousin Noel.

523
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:40,057
- Hi, there, sweetie. Hi.
- Huh?

524
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:42,031
Oh, we're just here to look in on you.

525
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,330
We know it's your first night and all.

526
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:47,303
We just want to see how you are. Oh!

527
00:43:47,372 --> 00:43:49,636
- Aren't you a pretty little thing?
- Not bad, huh?

528
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:51,334
We're just makin' sure everything's okay.

529
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,935
Oh, now, we're okay. Hey.
Ooh, look at those little titties.

530
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:55,446
You're right!
Oh, look at there.

531
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:56,740
What else is under there?

532
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:59,216
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

533
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:01,116
We got ourselves a fighter!

534
00:44:01,187 --> 00:44:02,677
A fresh one!
You done good, cousin.

535
00:44:02,755 --> 00:44:03,881
Hah-hah!

536
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:05,287
- I got an idea.
- Okay.

537
00:44:05,357 --> 00:44:09,259
I got me a fuckin' bona fide,
sure as shit idea!

538
00:44:09,328 --> 00:44:11,922
- Keep her fuckin' quiet.
- God, shut up.

539
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:18,794
Oh, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

540
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:20,237
Hello, Mike!

541
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:25,334
Hey, Mikey. We brought you
a little company.

542
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,744
Yeah, we got you
some new, fresh meat, baby.

543
00:44:27,814 --> 00:44:30,282
Fuckin' bitch.
You want some of that?

544
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,284
Come on, baby!

545
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:33,820
Show us you're a man, huh?

546
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:35,515
You want some fuckin' pussy?

547
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,888
Yeah.

548
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:39,950
You want some fuckin' pussy, huh?

549
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,694
Yeah. Mm, that's good.
How 'bout some of that, killer?

550
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,891
He ain't gonna do it.
Let me lick-

551
00:44:47,635 --> 00:44:48,897
Let me just-

552
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:50,437
You wanna fuckin' fight, huh?

553
00:44:50,505 --> 00:44:53,269
- Come on, bitch.
- Fuck the shit outta her.

554
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:55,435
- Come on! Get on her!
- Yeah, baby!

555
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,565
You fucking tard-ass faggot, come on!

556
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:17,827
Yeah!

557
00:45:24,507 --> 00:45:25,940
You a faggot, boy?

558
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,407
You a faggot, huh?

559
00:45:33,117 --> 00:45:34,209
What the fuck?

560
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:36,776
Hey, you son of a bitch!

561
00:45:36,854 --> 00:45:38,378
Son of a bitch!
Let him go.

562
00:45:38,455 --> 00:45:39,979
Kendall!

563
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,987
What the fuck, Mikey?
It's Kendall.

564
00:45:46,397 --> 00:45:47,591
It's Kendall, Mikey.

565
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:52,926
Gloria?

566
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:33,133
En el nombre del Padre, y del Hijo,
y del EspÃ­ritu Santo...

567
00:47:38,214 --> 00:47:41,672
Mikey, what are you doing
out of your room?

568
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:45,047
Okay...

569
00:47:47,158 --> 00:47:49,126
Now, don't do nothing

570
00:47:49,193 --> 00:47:52,492
we're both gonna regret later,
okay, Mikey?

571
00:47:52,563 --> 00:47:55,691
I'm gonna have to get you back
into your room, okay now?

572
00:47:56,967 --> 00:47:59,197
Let me get these.

573
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,999
I'm just gonna...

574
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:03,040
get these handcuffs and...

575
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:06,838
I'm gonna try to put these handcuffs
on you right now, Mikey.

576
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:09,881
And then we'll get you back
into your own bed, okay?

577
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,288
Mikey!

578
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,065
I was good to you, Mikey.

579
00:48:47,221 --> 00:48:49,451
I was good to you, Mikey.

580
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:50,675
Hello.

581
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,779
- Sam.
- Who is this?

582
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,118
Sam, it's Koplenson.

583
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,148
Who?

584
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,889
Dr. Koplenson from Smith's Grove.

585
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,692
He's out.

586
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:02,789
Michael's out.

587
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:05,563
Shit. What?

588
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:08,764
He broke out a few hours ago.

589
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,831
Sam, it's a-
it's a fucking massacre.

590
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:16,271
I'm coming right away.
All right.

591
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:19,548
Oh, shit.

592
00:50:25,257 --> 00:50:27,725
# A modern-day warrior
Mean, mean stride #

593
00:50:27,793 --> 00:50:29,988
# Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride #

594
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,544
Oh, fuck!

595
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:47,136
Gotta leave the truck.

596
00:50:49,749 --> 00:50:51,740
All right, boys.

597
00:50:51,818 --> 00:50:55,083
Grizzley's back in town.
Who's got the Cracker Jacks?

598
00:50:55,154 --> 00:50:57,179
Grizzley's back!

599
00:50:57,257 --> 00:50:58,884
All right!

600
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,118
Look it here.

601
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,990
That's a new paint job.

602
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:04,690
Don't mess it up. Don't scratch it.

603
00:51:10,471 --> 00:51:11,699
Yeah.

604
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:17,539
Oh, man.

605
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,379
Oh, my goodness.

606
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:24,748
Ooh!

607
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:34,317
# The world is,
the world is love and... #

608
00:51:35,363 --> 00:51:36,955
Naughty girl.

609
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:38,932
Naughty, naughty girl.

610
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:02,746
Hey, buddy,
just to give you a heads up,

611
00:52:02,826 --> 00:52:06,523
I got a taco deluxe supreme
talking back at me,

612
00:52:06,596 --> 00:52:07,961
so I'm going to be a while.

613
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:13,196
So do you mind waiting somewhere else
and let me pass this beast in peace?

614
00:52:21,879 --> 00:52:24,712
Look, brother...

615
00:52:24,782 --> 00:52:26,579
if you're looking for some kind of action,

616
00:52:26,651 --> 00:52:30,917
you better take it on the arches
before I'm done dropping this load.

617
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:33,855
Or you're going to be one sorry A-hole.

618
00:52:36,794 --> 00:52:38,386
I see.

619
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:42,490
What we got here is...

620
00:52:42,568 --> 00:52:44,832
a failure to communicate.

621
00:52:47,072 --> 00:52:50,974
You just hold on, Daisy.

622
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,034
I've got something for you.

623
00:52:56,448 --> 00:52:59,212
Let me introduce myself.

624
00:52:59,285 --> 00:53:01,185
I'm Joe Grizzley, bitch.

625
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:05,990
And I'm going to cut that mask
right off your face, you-

626
00:53:08,795 --> 00:53:10,353
Get- Get back!

627
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,057
I ain't scared!

628
00:53:26,814 --> 00:53:28,873
Come on, what-

629
00:54:04,253 --> 00:54:06,778
# Mr. Sandman... #

630
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:09,619
Mason, Laurie!

631
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,823
Morning.

632
00:54:14,897 --> 00:54:17,388
Where are my goddamn glasses?

633
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:19,299
- Jesus, Cynth, I'm gonna be late.
- On your head.

634
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:21,394
- Oh, sh- I'm gonna lose my mind.
- Move.

635
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:22,666
Excuse me.

636
00:54:25,576 --> 00:54:27,635
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Now what?

637
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:30,407
It says here Nickel's Hardware
is going out of business.

638
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:32,915
42 years and that's it, over and done.

639
00:54:32,983 --> 00:54:35,474
Yeah, well, good. They're a rip-off.

640
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:38,783
And Mr. Nickels is a horny old pervert.

641
00:54:38,857 --> 00:54:41,189
Okay, don't even want to know.

642
00:54:41,259 --> 00:54:42,453
Guess what, Mom.

643
00:54:42,527 --> 00:54:45,553
Mr. Nickels likes to touch me
the wrong way.

644
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,461
Ooh, whoo, Mommy!

645
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:49,090
Okay, that is so not funny.

646
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:51,101
Want a screwdriver, Mommy?
You want a hammer?

647
00:54:51,402 --> 00:54:52,733
Look at this, Mom. Oh!

648
00:54:52,804 --> 00:54:54,601
- Laurie, stop!
- I'm sorry. Okay.

649
00:54:54,672 --> 00:54:57,232
- Are you eating?
- No, I'll get something at school.

650
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:59,004
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, sure.

651
00:54:59,078 --> 00:55:02,343
Just let the faceless marauding
corporate monsters of America

652
00:55:02,414 --> 00:55:04,109
destroy everything
beautiful about this town.

653
00:55:04,183 --> 00:55:07,516
Corporate monsters or not,
Epic Mart's a lot cheaper.

654
00:55:07,586 --> 00:55:09,747
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

655
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:16,651
- Thanks again for dropping that thing off.
- No sweat, Dad.

656
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,290
Just shove the envelope
inside the mail slot, okay?

657
00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:20,594
Yeah, Dad, I know.

658
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,157
They're coming by to look at it later, honey.

659
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,224
- So, it's very important that-
- Dad, okay.

660
00:55:23,303 --> 00:55:25,533
I understand.
Muy importante.

661
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:26,663
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

662
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,832
Have a good day.

663
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:31,674
Mason, you forgot your briefcase, honey.

664
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,906
- Ah, shit.
- Ah, shit.

665
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,413
I feel like "What round is it?"

666
00:55:38,152 --> 00:55:39,278
Yeah.

667
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:43,346
Oh, uh, you think you could...
glue Mr. Bones' arms on or something?

668
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:46,757
- Have a good day, baby.
- Yeah. Top on my priority list.

669
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:51,287
Hey, Laurie!

670
00:55:51,365 --> 00:55:52,423
- Wait up!
- Oh, God.

671
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,401
- Leave me alone, Tommy.
- Wait.

672
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,439
Definition: Stop walking.

673
00:55:58,507 --> 00:56:01,874
- Can I ask you something serious?
- Sure, why not?

674
00:56:01,944 --> 00:56:04,310
Did you ever hear
about the Mexican Wolf Man?

675
00:56:04,379 --> 00:56:06,438
- No.
- Yeah, well, he's real.

676
00:56:06,515 --> 00:56:08,039
- I saw him on TV last night...
- Yeah.

677
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:11,882
And his name's Danny, and his face
is completely covered with hair.

678
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:13,649
And he likes soccer.
I swear it! They showed-

679
00:56:13,723 --> 00:56:14,781
- Okay.
- He's a wolf!

680
00:56:14,857 --> 00:56:17,121
Tommy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

681
00:56:17,193 --> 00:56:18,558
Lay off the candy corn, kid.

682
00:56:18,628 --> 00:56:21,153
Stop acting like I'm crazy. It's true!

683
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,255
Tommy, I'm your babysitter.
You're crazy.

684
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,824
- I know this. You're crazy.
- Ooohhh!

685
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:54,123
All right, gotta make a stop here.

686
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:57,392
Whoa! What are you, insane?

687
00:57:57,465 --> 00:57:59,899
Oh, my gosh, Tommy,
I'm not even listening to you.

688
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:01,992
You'd better listen to me.

689
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,264
He's right there.

690
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:05,430
What are you, crazy?
You can't go in there.

691
00:58:05,506 --> 00:58:07,201
Oh, yes, I can.

692
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,505
Hold my books, please?

693
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,506
That's the devil's house.
The Boogey Man lives in there.

694
00:58:13,582 --> 00:58:15,641
Yeah.
Oh, no, Tommy.

695
00:58:15,718 --> 00:58:17,811
Don't even joke about it.
I'm serious.

696
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:19,979
Oh, you're scaring me.

697
00:58:20,055 --> 00:58:23,286
The Boogey Man will get me
or Danny the Wolf Man.

698
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:31,425
Oh, no, Tommy.

699
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:34,265
Oh, no!

700
00:58:34,337 --> 00:58:35,964
Oh, no, it's pulling me-

701
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:38,530
Oh, no, Tommy, it's pulling me in!

702
00:58:38,608 --> 00:58:40,542
Ha ha ha.

703
00:58:41,244 --> 00:58:42,711
It was just a joke. Chill.

704
00:58:42,779 --> 00:58:44,679
I wish it wasn't.

705
00:58:44,748 --> 00:58:46,579
Come on, hurry up.

706
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:48,844
Chill, spazz-monkey.

707
00:58:48,918 --> 00:58:50,112
Thanks.

708
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,158
That's no place to screw around,
Laurie.

709
00:58:55,226 --> 00:58:57,751
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

710
00:58:57,828 --> 00:58:59,989
Do you know whose house that is?

711
00:59:00,064 --> 00:59:01,361
Come on.

712
00:59:01,432 --> 00:59:03,525
- It's going to be fine.
- Yeah.

713
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:05,034
What if something happens?

714
00:59:05,102 --> 00:59:07,866
- Laurie, what is going to happen?
- I don't know.

715
00:59:07,938 --> 00:59:09,599
It's going to be fine.

716
00:59:09,674 --> 00:59:11,904
What is going to be fine?

717
00:59:11,977 --> 00:59:15,310
Annie wants me to pretend
to baby-sit Lindsey Wallace,

718
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:18,941
then sneak out and dump her with me
so she can go and see Paul.

719
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:20,382
Sounds like
one of my crafty ideas.

720
00:59:20,452 --> 00:59:21,680
- Yeah.
- I like it.

721
00:59:21,753 --> 00:59:24,620
Anyway, I thought Paul was, like, grounded
for trashing his dad's motorcycle.

722
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:26,680
Oh, yeah.
No, he was, but he got out of it.

723
00:59:26,758 --> 00:59:28,020
- You know.
- Yeah.

724
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:30,357
Please?

725
00:59:30,429 --> 00:59:31,794
What if they come home early?

726
00:59:31,864 --> 00:59:34,526
Dude, they are not
going to come home early.

727
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,397
Okay? Mrs. Wallace is a lush.

728
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:39,461
They're going to be out all night
getting hammered.

729
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:42,406
Yeah. Annie, I really hate lying.
You know that.

730
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:45,035
God, what are you, Mother Teresa?

731
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:46,442
- No.
- Yes, she is.

732
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:48,139
Look at her.
She's like a little angel.

733
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:52,048
- She's Mother-fucking Teresa.
- Stop. I am not!

734
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:53,609
Please?

735
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,324
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes!

736
00:59:58,392 --> 00:59:59,586
You owe me big time.

737
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,594
- I love you.
- I love you.

738
01:00:03,897 --> 01:00:07,697
Did you know that ethyl alcohol
boils at 78.5 degrees Celsius?

739
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:09,235
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

740
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:10,771
That's pretty cool, right?

741
01:00:11,773 --> 01:00:12,865
Call me back.

742
01:00:16,277 --> 01:00:18,108
This is all your fault.

743
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:20,010
I mean, you're responsible.

744
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:26,477
I cannot be responsible
for everything that goes on in here.

745
01:00:26,554 --> 01:00:28,021
- What about you?
- No, no, no, no.

746
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,058
You're not pinning this on me.

747
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:33,822
- He was your patient, Doctor.
- Was my patient.

748
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:37,354
Look, all you guys had to do
was to play zoo-keeper.

749
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,891
Just keep the monkeyhouse locked
until the monkey died of old age.

750
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,437
How difficult is that?

751
01:00:42,504 --> 01:00:46,338
Christ, you can barely tell
he's breathing half the time.

752
01:00:46,408 --> 01:00:50,208
He's been like a comatose kitty
for 15 years.

753
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,113
If our security wasn't sufficient, Sammy,

754
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,980
you should have warned us.

755
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:59,317
I see. So you're just going
to wash your hands of the whole thing.

756
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:02,222
You know, you two make me sick.

757
01:01:10,368 --> 01:01:14,702
"He is mad that trusts
in the tameness of a wolf. "

758
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:19,035
We've given the authorities
his complete profile.

759
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:22,602
Two road blocks and an all-points bulletin
wouldn't stop a 5-year-old.

760
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,341
Well, what do you want us to do?

761
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:26,406
Yes. I mean,
what do you want us to do?

762
01:01:27,886 --> 01:01:29,854
I want you to get on the phone,

763
01:01:29,922 --> 01:01:33,619
and I want you to tell them
who broke out of here last night.

764
01:01:33,692 --> 01:01:37,150
And I want you to tell them
exactly where he's going.

765
01:01:37,229 --> 01:01:38,696
Christ, we don't know where he's going.

766
01:01:38,764 --> 01:01:40,857
It must be great living in denial.

767
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:42,525
I must try it sometime.

768
01:01:42,601 --> 01:01:46,298
Look, you and that army
of shirt-tuckers up there,

769
01:01:46,372 --> 01:01:48,340
you know damn well where he's going.

770
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:51,133
And where is that?

771
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:56,345
Haddonfield!

772
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:59,180
Haddonfield's a hundred miles
away from here.

773
01:02:00,453 --> 01:02:01,715
This is so fucked.

774
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:03,915
What, me suspended from the squad?

775
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,184
I don't mean to sound conceited,

776
01:02:05,259 --> 01:02:07,420
but I'm, like, the fucking hottest
cheerleader they've got.

777
01:02:07,494 --> 01:02:09,223
Yeah, Lynda,
that doesn't sound conceited.

778
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:11,196
What, so now nobody
can take a joke anymore?

779
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:12,892
- What did you say?
- Check it.

780
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:15,561
So Lady Fuck-face gives us
three new cheers to learn,

781
01:02:15,636 --> 01:02:19,595
so I'm like, "Hey, why don't we just
rock it commando, flash some snatch?

782
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:21,732
And maybe nobody will notice
we're doing the same old tired cheers. "

783
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:23,743
- Oh, you didn't.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

784
01:02:23,811 --> 01:02:24,800
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

785
01:02:24,879 --> 01:02:26,574
You know what that
dried-up fucking bitch did?

786
01:02:26,648 --> 01:02:29,344
- What?
- Calls my dad and tells him what I said.

787
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:30,406
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

788
01:02:30,485 --> 01:02:33,716
That C-U-N-T, yeah,
needs to get laid.

789
01:02:33,788 --> 01:02:35,415
What did your dad say?

790
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,718
Oh, who cares?

791
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:40,557
I'll just give him the little sweetie-pants
princess suck-up routine.

792
01:02:40,628 --> 01:02:43,859
Daddy's little pookie would never
say something like that.

793
01:02:43,932 --> 01:02:45,695
Gosh, ever since your parents split up,

794
01:02:45,768 --> 01:02:47,827
you have your dad
wrapped around your little finger.

795
01:02:47,903 --> 01:02:50,133
Totally wrapped.

796
01:02:50,206 --> 01:02:52,731
- Hey, bitches!
- Hey, Annie.

797
01:02:52,808 --> 01:02:56,471
- Thanks for waiting for me.
- Whatever. Hurry your ass up.

798
01:02:56,545 --> 01:02:58,274
God.

799
01:02:58,347 --> 01:03:01,578
Hey, I heard about your
little cheerleading incident.

800
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,880
Yeah, I'm totally famous.

801
01:03:03,954 --> 01:03:05,581
You're totally a slut.

802
01:03:05,655 --> 01:03:07,179
Yeah.

803
01:03:07,257 --> 01:03:09,088
Anyway, today in class,
in French class,

804
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:11,127
Mr. Leclerc was totally
flirting with me.

805
01:03:11,194 --> 01:03:15,096
- God, here we go!
- We were conjugating the verb "to want. "

806
01:03:15,165 --> 01:03:18,931
- Because he so wants you!
- Je veuxl Je veuxl

807
01:03:19,002 --> 01:03:21,800
- Oh, my gosh.
- Bare Leclerc.

808
01:03:21,872 --> 01:03:23,499
Bare Leclerc wants me.

809
01:03:23,574 --> 01:03:25,474
I think that guy's watching us.

810
01:03:25,543 --> 01:03:27,204
- What guy?
- That guy over there.

811
01:03:27,278 --> 01:03:28,370
Yeah?

812
01:03:28,446 --> 01:03:30,243
- Oh, please.
- I saw him outside school earlier.

813
01:03:30,314 --> 01:03:32,339
Probably just some pervert
cruising school poontang.

814
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:34,476
Yeah, wait. Watch this.

815
01:03:34,552 --> 01:03:36,076
Hey, freak!

816
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:38,019
Hey, freak, you want
some of the young stuff?

817
01:03:38,089 --> 01:03:39,989
You like that?
Well, come and get it.

818
01:03:40,058 --> 01:03:41,184
- Hey!
- Lynda, stop.

819
01:03:41,259 --> 01:03:43,591
Hey, asshole.
My daddy's the sheriff.

820
01:03:43,662 --> 01:03:46,062
Huh? Why don't you go crawl back
under your fucking rock?

821
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:48,691
- Yeah, whatever.
- See, I told you.

822
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:50,701
He's just some
stupid fucking pervert.

823
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:52,794
- Total pervert.
- Gosh, you guys are crazy.

824
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,133
That guy could have been dangerous.

825
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:55,434
- Oh, God.
- Whatever.

826
01:03:55,507 --> 01:03:57,304
- What is he going to do?
- I don't know.

827
01:03:57,376 --> 01:04:00,868
Oh, my God.
You should date him!

828
01:04:02,315 --> 01:04:04,249
- You should!
- You guys!

829
01:04:04,317 --> 01:04:05,409
Come on, let's go get something-

830
01:04:06,619 --> 01:04:08,644
- Oh, no, 5-0.
- Hey.

831
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:10,279
Hi, Dad.

832
01:04:10,356 --> 01:04:11,880
Hey, Mr. Brackett.

833
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:14,859
- Nice furry hat, Mr. Brackett.
- Thank you.

834
01:04:14,928 --> 01:04:16,190
What's up, Dad?

835
01:04:16,262 --> 01:04:18,958
I'm on my way home.
Anybody want a ride?

836
01:04:19,032 --> 01:04:20,499
Yeah. Hell, yeah, I'll take a ride.

837
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:21,727
- No.
- You guys?

838
01:04:21,802 --> 01:04:23,292
Bacon-mobiles make me nauseous.

839
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,928
- Nice.
- Bye, Annie.

840
01:04:25,005 --> 01:04:26,472
- See you later.
- Bye, guys.

841
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:28,405
Hey, kiddo.

842
01:04:31,312 --> 01:04:34,713
- Kind of a drag having a pig as a dad.
- Nah, I like him.

843
01:04:34,782 --> 01:04:37,250
Yeah? Do you think
he was flirting with me?

844
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:39,149
- You are so demented.
- Totally.

845
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:41,518
- Yeah. See ya.
- Bye.

846
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:20,360
I hate you!

847
01:05:25,502 --> 01:05:27,629
Aw, how cute.

848
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:29,865
Would you please help me
with this stupid thing?

849
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,771
Okay, okay, okay.

850
01:05:31,842 --> 01:05:34,936
Jeez. Mom, why do you
deal with this every year?

851
01:05:35,012 --> 01:05:37,071
Because for some unbelievable reason,

852
01:05:37,147 --> 01:05:39,911
your father likes it.

853
01:05:39,984 --> 01:05:42,009
- The feet look like the hands-
- It's not working.

854
01:05:42,086 --> 01:05:45,283
And the hands like the feet,
and I can't get the thing in the hole, and-

855
01:05:45,356 --> 01:05:48,382
- Oh, I can't get it!
- Calm down, I'm helping-

856
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:49,824
Oh, I got it.

857
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:52,863
- You got it?
- Will you try and get those right?

858
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:54,398
Okay, I'll try.

859
01:05:54,465 --> 01:05:55,625
Oh, jeez.

860
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,863
I've been out here
for two hours doing this.

861
01:05:58,937 --> 01:06:00,905
There.

862
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,440
- Hey, do you want me to get-
- Just hang himself. No!

863
01:06:03,509 --> 01:06:06,239
I'm still upset about the whole
bagel thing this morning,

864
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:07,301
if you want to know the truth.

865
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:08,539
Mom, that was a joke.

866
01:06:08,614 --> 01:06:09,979
- Oh, yeah. Well, let me tell you.
- It was a joke.

867
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,914
There are some things
moms don't need to hear.

868
01:06:11,984 --> 01:06:13,576
- Yeah, I'm 17.
- I know you're 17.

869
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:16,450
You're the best, Mom.

870
01:06:21,928 --> 01:06:23,759
Yeah, it's right over here.

871
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:27,065
Yeah. Hello?

872
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:29,533
Yes, uh, Sheriff Brackett, please.

873
01:06:29,603 --> 01:06:33,471
Dr. Samuel Loomis.
Yeah. Hello? He-

874
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:38,102
Oh, sh- ugh!
Can I borrow your cell phone?

875
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:40,738
This thing's about as useful
as a row of Christmas puddings.

876
01:06:40,815 --> 01:06:42,806
Oh, no. I don't have one.

877
01:06:42,883 --> 01:06:44,441
Causes brain cancer.

878
01:06:44,518 --> 01:06:46,247
Oh, yeah. Right.

879
01:06:46,387 --> 01:06:49,754
You know, I remember this mess
just like it happened yesterday?

880
01:06:49,824 --> 01:06:51,189
It was tragic.

881
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:53,056
The poor woman,
I guess she couldn't stand the stress

882
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:56,062
of being labeled "Satan's mother. "

883
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:58,564
I think she blew her fucking head off.

884
01:06:58,634 --> 01:07:00,465
I'm still amazed.

885
01:07:00,535 --> 01:07:04,027
A young boy like that
butchering all those people.

886
01:07:04,106 --> 01:07:07,974
And the doctor involved-
I think he wrote a book or something.

887
01:07:08,043 --> 01:07:09,533
Fucking blood money.

888
01:07:09,611 --> 01:07:11,374
Yeah, I read that book.
It was a masterpiece.

889
01:07:11,446 --> 01:07:14,108
- Now, are we close?
- Yes, it's just here. I gu-

890
01:07:15,617 --> 01:07:17,778
- Goddamn son of a bitch!
- What?

891
01:07:17,854 --> 01:07:20,652
Those fucking kids!
Jesus Christ!

892
01:07:20,723 --> 01:07:24,318
Don't they think I have anything better to do
with my time than clean up this shit?

893
01:07:24,394 --> 01:07:26,385
Fucking little idiots! God damn it!

894
01:07:26,462 --> 01:07:28,123
Where the hell are you going?

895
01:07:30,366 --> 01:07:33,927
Who would do sick shit like this?

896
01:07:34,003 --> 01:07:36,836
I think I know whose grave that is.

897
01:08:07,806 --> 01:08:11,333
Dude, it fucking totally sucks
that they're selling this place.

898
01:08:11,409 --> 01:08:13,934
It's reduced.
Maybe I can buy it.

899
01:08:14,012 --> 01:08:16,879
Yeah, with like, your $10 you have
in your piggy bank?

900
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:20,642
It's a shithole anyway.

901
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,210
I'm going to miss it.

902
01:08:22,288 --> 01:08:23,346
Don't worry, dude.

903
01:08:23,422 --> 01:08:25,788
We'll find another house to party in.

904
01:08:25,858 --> 01:08:28,827
Besides, I'm gonna
get the van all jacked up.

905
01:08:28,894 --> 01:08:31,658
You're gonna want to spend
more time in there anyway.

906
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:50,548
Wait, wait!

907
01:08:50,617 --> 01:08:52,778
Wait, just like that.

908
01:08:52,853 --> 01:08:55,287
Oh, God.

909
01:08:55,356 --> 01:08:56,448
Oh, wait. Wait.

910
01:08:56,524 --> 01:08:57,616
Right there, right there.

911
01:08:57,692 --> 01:09:00,490
- Hold on!
- Wait, my calf is cramping, man.

912
01:09:00,561 --> 01:09:02,290
Why'd you stop?
Oh, God-

913
01:09:02,363 --> 01:09:04,228
Oh, fuck.

914
01:09:09,036 --> 01:09:11,095
A fucking little warning would be nice.

915
01:09:11,172 --> 01:09:13,834
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry.

916
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:15,876
Jesus.

917
01:09:19,648 --> 01:09:22,014
- Get me another beer.
- You get it.

918
01:09:22,084 --> 01:09:24,644
I'm the one that just did all the heavy lifting.

919
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:27,922
All right, I'll go.

920
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:36,824
So, seriously, on a scale from 1 to 10,
should I have a 5?

921
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:41,303
How about... zero?

922
01:09:41,371 --> 01:09:42,531
- More like-
- Zero.

923
01:09:42,605 --> 01:09:43,833
More like zero plus 11.

924
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:25,476
- Hello?
- Yo, Mama.

925
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,313
What up, dude?

926
01:10:27,385 --> 01:10:30,183
- Nothing much.
- Oh, what's wrong?

927
01:10:30,255 --> 01:10:32,780
I was just thinking about
what Annie said earlier today,

928
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:35,191
concerning my so-called
"cheerleading incident. "

929
01:10:35,261 --> 01:10:37,092
I don't know.
It's kind of bumming me out.

930
01:10:39,565 --> 01:10:42,500
Fuck, dude, who put
all the empties back in here?

931
01:10:43,836 --> 01:10:45,167
You don't think that, do you?

932
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:46,500
Lynda, I don't think you're a slut.

933
01:10:46,572 --> 01:10:48,005
Come on, that's ridiculous.

934
01:10:48,074 --> 01:10:50,702
I don't give a shit what Annie thinks anyway.

935
01:10:50,776 --> 01:10:51,902
But I care what you think.

936
01:10:52,412 --> 01:10:54,039
Aww!

937
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:10,619
Fuck!

938
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:13,633
What- What the f-

939
01:11:56,413 --> 01:11:59,905
Jesus, Bob, could you move
your pokey ass a little slower?

940
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:01,314
Well, could you?

941
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:07,621
Well, that's cute.

942
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:11,858
See anything you like?

943
01:12:20,204 --> 01:12:21,865
Okay, enough.

944
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:23,372
Joke's over.

945
01:12:23,441 --> 01:12:25,068
Beer, please.

946
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,213
Hey, Casper the Friendly Asshole Ghost,
hand me my beer.

947
01:12:35,687 --> 01:12:37,814
Well, fucking hand it over, dip-shit.

948
01:12:40,792 --> 01:12:43,625
Why do you have to become
such a fucking jerk every time we do it?

949
01:12:43,695 --> 01:12:46,459
You think you'd be grateful
that I let you touch me with that thing.

950
01:12:46,531 --> 01:12:47,896
And anyway, you're not a zero.

951
01:12:47,966 --> 01:12:50,434
You're a fucking minus 5 or something.

952
01:12:50,503 --> 01:12:51,765
Whatever.

953
01:12:51,838 --> 01:12:53,396
What'd you do to this beer?

954
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,250
What about this big one here?
That looks perfect.

955
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,843
- You mean, like, this one here?
- Yeah, that one.

956
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:42,822
- Yes, yes, that's lovely.
- .22 Smith & Wesson.

957
01:13:42,891 --> 01:13:44,722
- That's good.
- Yeah.

958
01:13:44,793 --> 01:13:46,886
That's okay if you want to just piss it off.

959
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:50,692
If you want to blow its fucking head off...

960
01:13:50,766 --> 01:13:52,063
this is what you want.

961
01:13:52,134 --> 01:13:53,999
.357 Magnum.

962
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:56,436
Wolff mainspring, polygonal rifling.

963
01:13:56,505 --> 01:13:57,972
Beautiful, beautiful.
Poly what?

964
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,770
- Muzzle velocity of 1,450 feet per second.
- Great, just wrap it up.

965
01:14:00,843 --> 01:14:02,174
- That's fine.
- Okay, okay.

966
01:14:02,244 --> 01:14:03,836
- Take it easy.
- Thank you. Yes.

967
01:14:03,913 --> 01:14:05,005
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

968
01:14:05,081 --> 01:14:06,571
If you could just wrap it up,
that'd be great.

969
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:08,139
- Thank you.
- What are we hunting?

970
01:14:08,218 --> 01:14:12,279
- Girls, you look so beautiful.
- Little princesses.

971
01:14:12,355 --> 01:14:13,344
- Trick or treat.
- Here you go.

972
01:14:13,423 --> 01:14:14,447
- Thank you.
- Here's some candy.

973
01:14:14,524 --> 01:14:16,822
- Oh, Happy Halloween.
- You, too.

974
01:14:16,893 --> 01:14:19,555
- Bye, you guys.
- Thank you. Bye.

975
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:22,928
So cute.

976
01:14:22,999 --> 01:14:25,593
I cannot believe you're graduating this year.

977
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:28,399
I remember when you used
to run around looking like that.

978
01:14:28,473 --> 01:14:30,407
Mom, I was never a princess.

979
01:14:30,475 --> 01:14:32,739
Last thing I was at their age
was dead Little Red Riding Hood.

980
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:34,107
You were this beautiful ballerina-

981
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,942
No, you bought me the blood
and you gave me the cuts.

982
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:38,379
"My costume's too tight. "

983
01:14:38,449 --> 01:14:40,041
- You don't remember that?
- I never wore a tutu.

984
01:14:40,118 --> 01:14:41,847
You getting many kids?

985
01:14:41,919 --> 01:14:44,786
Only two so far.

986
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:47,290
Listen...

987
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:48,348
be careful tonight.

988
01:14:48,427 --> 01:14:49,416
I know.

989
01:14:49,495 --> 01:14:51,895
A lot of nut cases come out on Halloween.

990
01:14:51,964 --> 01:14:55,161
It's, uh-
What was it you told me to say?

991
01:14:56,635 --> 01:14:59,297
- Amateur night.
- Yeah, that's right. Amateur night.

992
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:01,498
Dad, I'm just going to be babysitting.

993
01:15:01,573 --> 01:15:03,165
- What's the worst thing I could do?
- All right, okay.

994
01:15:03,242 --> 01:15:04,937
- I'm just saying.
- Nice.

995
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:06,034
- All right.
- Sorry.

996
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,669
- Aah!
- Mom, st-

997
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:13,680
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Strode!

998
01:15:13,753 --> 01:15:14,879
- Hey, Annie.
- Hey.

999
01:15:14,954 --> 01:15:16,012
How's your dad?

1000
01:15:16,089 --> 01:15:18,683
Oh, you know, same as always.

1001
01:15:18,758 --> 01:15:20,953
- You know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.

1002
01:15:22,629 --> 01:15:24,096
Yeah. Love you guys!

1003
01:15:24,164 --> 01:15:26,496
- Love you, too!
- Bye-bye!

1004
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:27,829
Gonna give me some lovin'?

1005
01:15:27,902 --> 01:15:32,202
I'll give you some lovin' later, but first
you're going to talk about the vacation.

1006
01:15:32,273 --> 01:15:35,640
I'm going to go build a fire.

1007
01:15:35,709 --> 01:15:37,404
Vacation.

1008
01:15:37,478 --> 01:15:39,946
I hate vacation. Let's stay home.

1009
01:16:12,315 --> 01:16:13,612
Aaahhh!

1010
01:16:40,577 --> 01:16:42,568
No! No!

1011
01:16:42,646 --> 01:16:45,911
You leave my baby alone, you-

1012
01:17:06,005 --> 01:17:08,473
Okay, Tommy,
here's your jelly sandwich,

1013
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,565
hold the peanut butter.

1014
01:17:10,643 --> 01:17:11,871
Good.

1015
01:17:11,944 --> 01:17:13,844
You know, if you listened to me
the first time,

1016
01:17:13,913 --> 01:17:15,403
you wouldn't had to have made it twice.

1017
01:17:18,651 --> 01:17:21,119
- Laurie?
- What?

1018
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,821
Is the Boogey Man real?

1019
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:26,188
Why are you so obsessed
with the Boogey Man, Tommy?

1020
01:17:26,259 --> 01:17:29,558
- Well, I hear things at school.
- Like what?

1021
01:17:29,629 --> 01:17:32,359
Well, I heard that on Halloween night,

1022
01:17:32,432 --> 01:17:35,890
the Boogey Man sneaks out
and attacks kids who don't believe.

1023
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:39,762
You know what, Tommy?

1024
01:17:39,839 --> 01:17:41,807
It is true.

1025
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:44,537
He likes to eat little boys like you.

1026
01:17:46,614 --> 01:17:48,206
Oh, my God!
The Boogey Man's here!

1027
01:17:48,282 --> 01:17:49,977
We're going to die!

1028
01:17:51,452 --> 01:17:53,010
Hold that thought.

1029
01:17:53,087 --> 01:17:55,282
That's not appropriate
babysitter behavior, Laurie.

1030
01:17:55,356 --> 01:17:56,584
Hello?

1031
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:58,724
Shut up.

1032
01:17:58,793 --> 01:18:01,626
- My parents will hear about this one.
- Yo, it's me. Hey.

1033
01:18:01,696 --> 01:18:03,994
So the Wallaces are finally out of my face.

1034
01:18:04,066 --> 01:18:05,658
I just talked to Paul.
He's on his way over.

1035
01:18:05,734 --> 01:18:11,229
So I'm finishing making the Queen of Sheba
her popcorn, and then I will be over.

1036
01:18:11,306 --> 01:18:14,434
I have some fun and exciting news for you,
so I'll see you in a few minutes.

1037
01:18:14,509 --> 01:18:15,942
Okay, bye.

1038
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,011
- Guess what, Tommy.
- What?

1039
01:18:20,082 --> 01:18:22,573
Lindsey Wallace is coming over.

1040
01:18:22,652 --> 01:18:24,677
What? She can't come over here!

1041
01:18:24,754 --> 01:18:27,552
- What if the guys see her?
- So?

1042
01:18:27,623 --> 01:18:29,090
One, she's a girl.

1043
01:18:29,158 --> 01:18:31,285
Two, she's not a boy.

1044
01:18:31,361 --> 01:18:33,022
And three, she smells like you.

1045
01:18:33,096 --> 01:18:36,497
This is going to be a long night.

1046
01:18:36,566 --> 01:18:37,897
For the both of us.

1047
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:39,890
- Don't start with me.
- Uh, uh.

1048
01:18:39,969 --> 01:18:41,994
What's the matter with you?

1049
01:19:08,633 --> 01:19:11,431
Lindsey... get your coat on.

1050
01:19:11,503 --> 01:19:13,437
We're going to go over
and see Tommy Doyal.

1051
01:19:13,505 --> 01:19:15,268
Okay.

1052
01:19:22,748 --> 01:19:25,683
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1053
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:28,083
Yeah, exactly.
I said get your coat on.

1054
01:19:28,154 --> 01:19:32,215
We're going over to your late-night lover
Tommy Doyal's house.

1055
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:33,417
No, you didn't.

1056
01:19:33,492 --> 01:19:34,754
Yes, I did.

1057
01:19:34,827 --> 01:19:36,818
No, you didn't.

1058
01:19:36,896 --> 01:19:41,333
Don, I'm sorry if I don't
sound too concerned,

1059
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:45,497
but a dead coyote and a missing headstone
doesn't prove anything.

1060
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:46,596
Well, I think you're wrong, Sheriff.

1061
01:19:46,673 --> 01:19:49,369
I think it does prove
that he's here in Haddonfield.

1062
01:19:49,443 --> 01:19:52,003
It was a Halloween prank.

1063
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,377
Kids pull shit like that all the time.

1064
01:19:54,448 --> 01:19:55,972
The stone will be returned tomorrow.

1065
01:19:56,049 --> 01:19:58,108
And besides, it weighs over half a ton.

1066
01:19:58,185 --> 01:20:00,653
That's my point exactly.

1067
01:20:00,721 --> 01:20:04,657
So you're saying that one man picked it up
and walked away with it?

1068
01:20:04,725 --> 01:20:05,851
Yes.

1069
01:20:05,927 --> 01:20:08,623
Doc, I may have been born,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

1070
01:20:08,696 --> 01:20:11,961
I'm sorry, Sheriff,
but please listen to me.

1071
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:14,263
This may be a matter of life and death.

1072
01:20:14,335 --> 01:20:17,463
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1073
01:20:17,538 --> 01:20:19,335
You come by my office tomorrow-

1074
01:20:19,408 --> 01:20:21,842
Tomorrow is too late.

1075
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:24,174
Evil is here.

1076
01:20:24,246 --> 01:20:26,077
It's walking amongst us.

1077
01:20:26,148 --> 01:20:29,140
Doc, it sounds to me like
you're talking about the Antichrist.

1078
01:20:29,218 --> 01:20:31,778
Well, perhaps I am.

1079
01:20:31,854 --> 01:20:32,843
Smell my feet

1080
01:20:32,921 --> 01:20:34,582
Give me something good to eat

1081
01:20:34,656 --> 01:20:36,453
If you don't, I don't care

1082
01:20:36,525 --> 01:20:38,459
I'll pull down Annie's underwear

1083
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:41,656
I can't believe you're making me
haul this thing all the way over there.

1084
01:20:41,731 --> 01:20:45,167
I can't believe you think
I'm not going to tell.

1085
01:20:46,269 --> 01:20:49,102
Gonna share some popcorn
with your little boyfriend?

1086
01:20:49,172 --> 01:20:51,037
No, I'm not.

1087
01:20:51,107 --> 01:20:52,631
You know you are.

1088
01:20:52,709 --> 01:20:55,371
You know you're going
to share something with Paul.

1089
01:20:55,445 --> 01:20:57,640
You know how annoying you are?

1090
01:20:57,714 --> 01:20:59,579
How?

1091
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:01,709
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

1092
01:21:01,785 --> 01:21:03,514
Give me something good to eat

1093
01:21:03,587 --> 01:21:06,579
- If you don't, I don't care-
- I swear to God, Lindsey.

1094
01:21:06,657 --> 01:21:08,147
If you don't stop singing that song,

1095
01:21:08,225 --> 01:21:10,056
we're going to have
a pumpkin-smashing party

1096
01:21:10,127 --> 01:21:11,856
right here in the middle of the street.

1097
01:21:20,705 --> 01:21:22,935
Tommy, where's your girlfriend Laurie?

1098
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:25,374
Laurie's not my girlfriend.
I hate girls.

1099
01:21:25,443 --> 01:21:27,638
Why doesn't anyone understand this?

1100
01:21:27,712 --> 01:21:29,304
Good. So does Lindsey.

1101
01:21:29,381 --> 01:21:31,076
Go worship your god.

1102
01:21:31,149 --> 01:21:33,549
- Hey.
- Brought you a present.

1103
01:21:33,618 --> 01:21:35,245
Thanks.

1104
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,414
You, my dear, will be happy to know

1105
01:21:38,491 --> 01:21:41,460
that I talked to Paul
about his buddy Ben Tramer.

1106
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:44,018
Oh, I thought you said
Ben Tramer was retarded.

1107
01:21:44,096 --> 01:21:48,226
Yeah, but he's not
Shortbus retarded or anything.

1108
01:21:48,301 --> 01:21:49,359
What? He's okay.

1109
01:21:49,435 --> 01:21:53,064
- I mean, you need a boyfriend!
- Annie, I don't need a boyfriend.

1110
01:21:53,139 --> 01:21:54,470
- No, that's not what I meant.
- I'm fine.

1111
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,132
- You need-
- Okay, Annie-

1112
01:21:56,209 --> 01:21:58,040
Oh! Oh! Yes!

1113
01:21:58,111 --> 01:21:59,135
Yes, Annie!

1114
01:21:59,213 --> 01:22:01,408
Okay, ok-

1115
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:02,743
All right, you're right.

1116
01:22:02,816 --> 01:22:04,078
I need a boyfriend.

1117
01:22:04,151 --> 01:22:05,914
So, what did he say?

1118
01:22:05,986 --> 01:22:08,921
He said, and I quote,

1119
01:22:08,989 --> 01:22:12,447
"Dude, she's fucking hot. "

1120
01:22:12,526 --> 01:22:14,426
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1121
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,328
Oh, fuck, that's Paul.
I gotta go.

1122
01:22:21,402 --> 01:22:23,233
- Have fun.
- Thanks, I will.

1123
01:22:23,304 --> 01:22:24,965
- Bye, sexy.
- Bye.

1124
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:31,974
Hi, baby.

1125
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:33,604
- What's up?
- How are you?

1126
01:22:33,681 --> 01:22:34,773
I'm good.
How are you?

1127
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,009
Good.

1128
01:22:36,752 --> 01:22:40,711
You have to stop thinking
that we're dealing with a normal man here.

1129
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,054
We're dealing with
a soulless killing machine,

1130
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:46,754
driven by pure animal instinct.

1131
01:22:47,997 --> 01:22:51,899
Dr. Loomis, I'm going
to have to level with you.

1132
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,832
I read your book.

1133
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:56,700
I know exactly who you are,
and frankly, I don't like you.

1134
01:22:56,773 --> 01:22:58,604
And I'll tell you something else.

1135
01:22:58,675 --> 01:23:02,338
I think you have created
quite the masterpiece of a monster

1136
01:23:02,412 --> 01:23:07,816
off the blood of this town,
because monsters sell books.

1137
01:23:07,884 --> 01:23:12,287
Please, just look at this photograph
on the cover of the book.

1138
01:23:12,355 --> 01:23:13,447
All right.

1139
01:23:15,426 --> 01:23:18,862
I first met Michael 17 years ago.

1140
01:23:18,929 --> 01:23:24,492
When I first met him,
he was a sweet, charming little boy.

1141
01:23:24,568 --> 01:23:28,265
But he had nothing inside.

1142
01:23:28,339 --> 01:23:30,967
There was something missing, a void.

1143
01:23:31,042 --> 01:23:34,603
There was no conscience, no reason,

1144
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:40,277
even a rudimentary sense
of life or death, right or wrong.

1145
01:23:40,352 --> 01:23:44,118
Yeah. He's come back for her.

1146
01:23:44,189 --> 01:23:48,558
And who is her?

1147
01:23:48,627 --> 01:23:52,188
He's come back for his baby sister.

1148
01:23:52,264 --> 01:23:55,062
I know it in my bones, Sheriff.

1149
01:23:56,636 --> 01:23:57,967
To do what?

1150
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:03,771
I don't know, Sheriff, but...

1151
01:24:05,144 --> 01:24:07,374
it's not good.

1152
01:24:11,417 --> 01:24:15,319
If I break a promise I made a long time ago,

1153
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:18,825
then you must promise that you will play it

1154
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:22,555
razor, and I mean razor, straight with me.

1155
01:24:25,933 --> 01:24:28,561
Hello. You have reached
the Strode residence.

1156
01:24:28,635 --> 01:24:31,399
We can't come to the phone right now.

1157
01:24:31,472 --> 01:24:35,499
So please leave a message and have a...

1158
01:24:35,577 --> 01:24:39,377
Happy Halloween!

1159
01:24:41,616 --> 01:24:44,346
Yeah, this is Sheriff Brackett. Hello?

1160
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:45,886
If you can hear me, pick up.

1161
01:24:45,954 --> 01:24:50,721
Please, if you can hear me,
I need to talk to you immediately.

1162
01:24:56,899 --> 01:24:57,888
Let's go.

1163
01:24:57,967 --> 01:25:00,902
- Laurie?
- What, Tommy?

1164
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:05,430
I would like to return to the subject
we started earlier this evening.

1165
01:25:05,508 --> 01:25:07,032
What? Your hatred of peanut butter?

1166
01:25:07,109 --> 01:25:09,270
No, the Boogey Man.

1167
01:25:09,345 --> 01:25:11,506
I need some closure on this topic.

1168
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,104
I've heard all about this.

1169
01:25:13,183 --> 01:25:15,583
What do you want to know, Tommy?

1170
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,950
Why would he only attack kids
who don't believe?

1171
01:25:18,021 --> 01:25:20,148
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

1172
01:25:20,223 --> 01:25:22,817
Is it because if you believe,
then you're protected by his powers?

1173
01:25:22,893 --> 01:25:24,827
Okay, Tommy,
enough about the Boogey Man.

1174
01:25:24,895 --> 01:25:25,953
It's nonsense.

1175
01:25:26,029 --> 01:25:28,759
I'm with Tommy on this one.

1176
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:32,825
Yeah. Why do you keep
avoiding the subject, Laurie?

1177
01:25:32,904 --> 01:25:34,701
Is- Is she scared?

1178
01:25:34,772 --> 01:25:36,000
- Maybe she is.
- Ooh, yeah.

1179
01:25:36,073 --> 01:25:38,234
- Maybe you're scared!
- Are you scared?

1180
01:25:38,309 --> 01:25:40,004
Okay, stop! Stop!

1181
01:25:40,077 --> 01:25:43,604
Leave me alone for five seconds, please.

1182
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:46,479
- Five, four, three...
- You guys...

1183
01:25:46,551 --> 01:25:48,678
- Okay, please don't.
- Two, one.

1184
01:25:48,753 --> 01:25:50,277
No! No!

1185
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:51,981
I'm going to tell your parents!

1186
01:25:55,694 --> 01:25:58,686
Hey, don't pull it like that.
You're going to stretch it all out.

1187
01:25:58,764 --> 01:26:02,757
- Come on, munchie.
- Stop. This is expensive, idiot.

1188
01:26:12,212 --> 01:26:14,077
- You want to fuck me?
- Yeah.

1189
01:26:14,147 --> 01:26:15,876
- Yeah?
- You're so fucking hot, babe.

1190
01:26:15,949 --> 01:26:18,816
You want to fuck me?
I want to hear you say it.

1191
01:26:18,885 --> 01:26:20,375
- I'm gonna fuck you.
- Yeah?

1192
01:26:20,453 --> 01:26:21,852
Say it again.

1193
01:26:26,392 --> 01:26:28,587
It's so fucking warm.

1194
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:56,682
Oh, my-

1195
01:26:56,758 --> 01:26:57,850
What's the matter?

1196
01:28:19,411 --> 01:28:21,174
Lindsey, it's time for you to go home.

1197
01:28:21,246 --> 01:28:22,804
But the movie's not over.

1198
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,508
You can finish watching the movie
at your house.

1199
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:27,575
- How about during the commercial break?
- Negative.

1200
01:28:27,654 --> 01:28:28,951
Go get your jacket!

1201
01:28:29,022 --> 01:28:32,287
You heard her, girl.
Keep on marching.

1202
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:34,657
Ugh! I am Queen Sheba, okay?

1203
01:28:34,728 --> 01:28:38,630
- Bow down and worship me.
- Go get your jacket.

1204
01:28:40,634 --> 01:28:42,363
Are you sure you're okay
while I take Lindsey home?

1205
01:28:42,435 --> 01:28:44,926
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure, little Tommy?

1206
01:28:45,005 --> 01:28:48,497
- You'll be by yourself!
- I'm fine, now stop asking!

1207
01:28:48,576 --> 01:28:49,565
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

1208
01:28:49,644 --> 01:28:51,942
- He's scared.
- No, I'm not.

1209
01:28:52,013 --> 01:28:53,378
- Yes, you are.
- Shut up.

1210
01:28:53,447 --> 01:28:56,245
Okay, you guys. Stop.

1211
01:28:56,317 --> 01:28:59,218
Behave, Tommy-Wommy.

1212
01:29:01,622 --> 01:29:05,786
About 17 years ago,
I respond to a 911

1213
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:08,852
which turned out to be
the Myers woman's suicide.

1214
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:14,027
And I see this beautiful,
innocent baby sitting in this bloody mess,

1215
01:29:14,102 --> 01:29:17,265
and I can't imagine this child growing up
with a stigma around her neck,

1216
01:29:17,839 --> 01:29:23,641
so I omit her from the report,
I drive her to another town,

1217
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,976
and drop her off
at the nearest emergency room.

1218
01:29:26,049 --> 01:29:27,880
And I think that this
is going to be the end of it.

1219
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:30,817
About three months later,
I find out from a friend of mine,

1220
01:29:30,887 --> 01:29:33,947
Mason Strode,
that he's adopted the baby.

1221
01:29:34,023 --> 01:29:35,285
Oh, my God.

1222
01:29:43,766 --> 01:29:45,495
- Cold?
- Yeah.

1223
01:29:45,569 --> 01:29:47,059
Okay, come here.

1224
01:29:49,239 --> 01:29:51,366
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

1225
01:29:51,442 --> 01:29:53,273
You sure?

1226
01:29:53,343 --> 01:29:54,571
Yeah.

1227
01:29:57,314 --> 01:29:59,475
Annie? We're coming in.

1228
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:01,279
You better be decent.

1229
01:30:03,854 --> 01:30:05,788
- Where are the lights?
- Here.

1230
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:09,849
Annie!

1231
01:30:12,063 --> 01:30:13,291
Oh, my God!

1232
01:30:13,698 --> 01:30:14,790
Lindsey, run home!

1233
01:30:14,866 --> 01:30:16,766
Go call the police! Go!

1234
01:30:16,835 --> 01:30:20,100
Help! Help! Help!

1235
01:30:20,171 --> 01:30:23,072
Oh, my God, honey!
Are you okay?

1236
01:30:23,141 --> 01:30:25,803
Oh, baby, what happened?

1237
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,107
- He's in-
- I'm going to call the police.

1238
01:30:29,181 --> 01:30:30,978
Okay? I promise.

1239
01:30:45,799 --> 01:30:47,096
Shit!

1240
01:30:50,604 --> 01:30:54,165
- 911.
- I need an ambulance, please!

1241
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:56,709
My friend's bleeding to death.

1242
01:31:22,637 --> 01:31:28,840
Laurie!

1243
01:31:28,911 --> 01:31:33,575
My name is Laurie Strode,
and I'm at 1987 Winchester Drive.

1244
01:31:33,649 --> 01:31:36,675
We have a 911 call,
1987 Winchester Drive.

1245
01:31:39,488 --> 01:31:40,546
This is Brackett.

1246
01:31:40,622 --> 01:31:43,284
What's the nature of the emergency
and who called it in?

1247
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:46,385
Two-stabbing-victim call
placed by a Laurie Strode.

1248
01:31:46,462 --> 01:31:49,090
He's found her!
He's found her, for God's sake!

1249
01:31:49,165 --> 01:31:52,066
- How long's it going to take to get there?
- It's about ten minutes.

1250
01:31:53,436 --> 01:31:55,370
Laurie!

1251
01:31:55,438 --> 01:31:56,871
Please, you've got to help her.

1252
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:58,965
Laurie!

1253
01:31:59,042 --> 01:32:02,739
Baby! Baby, hold on, okay?
Annie, they're com-

1254
01:32:28,173 --> 01:32:30,801
Help!

1255
01:32:30,876 --> 01:32:32,639
Help! Please!

1256
01:32:36,882 --> 01:32:39,316
Help!

1257
01:32:39,384 --> 01:32:41,477
Help! Please!

1258
01:32:41,554 --> 01:32:44,352
Help, please! Someone!

1259
01:32:50,596 --> 01:32:52,826
Tommy!

1260
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,425
Tommy, open the door!

1261
01:32:56,502 --> 01:33:00,461
Open the door!
Tommy, open the door!

1262
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:03,974
Tommy!
Open the door!

1263
01:33:04,044 --> 01:33:08,811
Open the door! Tommy!
Open the door!

1264
01:33:08,882 --> 01:33:10,440
What's going on?

1265
01:33:10,517 --> 01:33:11,609
What's happening?

1266
01:33:11,685 --> 01:33:12,845
Where's Lindsey, Tommy?

1267
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:13,978
- Where's Lindsey?
- She's right there!

1268
01:33:14,054 --> 01:33:16,079
- She's upstairs!
- I'm right here.

1269
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:22,461
Go upstairs!

1270
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:24,828
Tommy, go upstairs!

1271
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,837
Guys, get in the bathroom!

1272
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:37,942
- He's coming!
- Stop! Shh!

1273
01:33:38,012 --> 01:33:40,412
Tommy, be quiet, please?

1274
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:55,559
I got this.
You check upstairs.

1275
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:56,996
Right.

1276
01:34:14,617 --> 01:34:16,983
This is the police.
Are you all right?

1277
01:34:17,053 --> 01:34:19,988
He's out there! Please help us!

1278
01:34:20,057 --> 01:34:21,183
The door's locked.

1279
01:34:21,258 --> 01:34:22,885
Are you able to unlock the door?

1280
01:34:30,968 --> 01:34:32,560
Are you able to open the door?

1281
01:34:33,771 --> 01:34:35,068
Yeah.

1282
01:34:37,074 --> 01:34:38,871
Laurie, no.

1283
01:34:38,944 --> 01:34:40,275
Is he gone?

1284
01:34:40,345 --> 01:34:41,937
No, there's no one out here.

1285
01:34:47,386 --> 01:34:49,377
Please, just unlock the door.

1286
01:34:49,454 --> 01:34:50,785
Yeah, hold on.

1287
01:34:50,856 --> 01:34:54,917
- No!
- Open the door.

1288
01:35:01,501 --> 01:35:02,661
Oh, God!

1289
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:14,972
Freeze!

1290
01:35:19,186 --> 01:35:20,813
Aah!

1291
01:36:28,725 --> 01:36:30,352
Stay behind me.

1292
01:36:45,176 --> 01:36:47,041
Annie?

1293
01:36:47,111 --> 01:36:48,544
Sweetie?

1294
01:36:49,347 --> 01:36:51,144
Annie.

1295
01:36:51,215 --> 01:36:53,240
Annie. Oh, sweetie.

1296
01:36:53,317 --> 01:36:56,218
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

1297
01:36:56,288 --> 01:36:58,347
They'll be here soon.
Come on, darling.

1298
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:00,614
Jesus.

1299
01:37:00,692 --> 01:37:02,557
Over here!

1300
01:37:03,795 --> 01:37:04,784
Inside here!

1301
01:37:04,863 --> 01:37:06,558
- Boogey Man!
- Help!

1302
01:37:09,401 --> 01:37:10,459
Guys, over here!

1303
01:37:10,536 --> 01:37:12,128
- The Boogey Man!
- What is it?

1304
01:37:12,204 --> 01:37:13,967
Help! The Boogey Man!

1305
01:37:14,039 --> 01:37:15,028
- What? What?
- He's over there!

1306
01:37:15,108 --> 01:37:17,668
He took Laurie.
He took Laurie away.

1307
01:37:17,744 --> 01:37:18,836
Okay, guys.

1308
01:37:18,912 --> 01:37:21,346
Go over and stand by that ambulance
and just wait there.

1309
01:37:21,414 --> 01:37:22,881
Don't move!

1310
01:37:52,179 --> 01:37:54,511
Lynda?

1311
01:37:57,152 --> 01:37:58,949
Lynda?

1312
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:08,026
Lynda, wake up!

1313
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:10,326
Lynda, wake up, please!

1314
01:38:10,398 --> 01:38:12,025
Lynda, wake up!

1315
01:38:15,371 --> 01:38:17,737
Lynda, please wake up!

1316
01:38:21,677 --> 01:38:25,704
Lynda, please!
Please, please, please wake up!

1317
01:38:28,084 --> 01:38:29,244
He's going to come soon.

1318
01:38:29,318 --> 01:38:32,116
Lynda, wake up, please!

1319
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:42,728
Who are you?

1320
01:38:42,799 --> 01:38:43,993
What do you want?

1321
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:51,564
No, no, please.

1322
01:38:51,642 --> 01:38:54,440
Please don't hurt us, please!

1323
01:38:54,512 --> 01:38:57,310
No, please don't hurt me, please!

1324
01:39:28,147 --> 01:39:29,512
I don't understand.

1325
01:39:29,581 --> 01:39:33,915
Please, just let-
Please leave me alone!

1326
01:39:33,987 --> 01:39:37,047
I don't know them! Please!

1327
01:40:19,601 --> 01:40:22,502
I want to help you.

1328
01:40:22,571 --> 01:40:25,335
I just don't understand.

1329
01:40:25,407 --> 01:40:28,274
I want to help you.

1330
01:40:28,343 --> 01:40:31,870
I just don't know how.

1331
01:40:31,948 --> 01:40:34,974
I want to help you.

1332
01:40:35,051 --> 01:40:36,951
I don't-

1333
01:40:37,019 --> 01:40:38,714
You motherfucker!

1334
01:40:44,794 --> 01:40:47,285
Someone help me!

1335
01:40:48,264 --> 01:40:50,824
Shit. Let me out!

1338
01:41:17,796 --> 01:41:20,390
Somebody, please help me!

1339
01:41:25,336 --> 01:41:27,804
Please!
Somebody, please!

1340
01:41:55,702 --> 01:41:57,465

1343
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:49,748

Help! Help!

1347
01:42:58,835 --> 01:43:01,133
Somebody, please!

1348
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,739
Please. Please.

1349
01:43:11,081 --> 01:43:13,049
No. No. No.

1350
01:43:13,751 --> 01:43:15,378
Shit.

1351
01:43:18,522 --> 01:43:21,355
Please! Somebody!

1352
01:43:32,037 --> 01:43:34,528
Michael! Stop!

1353
01:43:36,741 --> 01:43:39,539
Michael, it's me... Samuel.

1354
01:43:42,814 --> 01:43:45,339
Michael, please stop!

1355
01:43:45,418 --> 01:43:48,251
Help! Please!

1356
01:43:48,321 --> 01:43:50,551
Please! Stop!

1357
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:55,093
Stop! Michael!

1358
01:43:56,829 --> 01:43:58,091
Shit.

1359
01:43:58,164 --> 01:43:59,791
Help!

1360
01:43:59,865 --> 01:44:01,264
Stop!

1361
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:10,509
Please.

1362
01:44:16,383 --> 01:44:18,146
Help me, please.

1363
01:44:22,289 --> 01:44:24,723
It's all right. It's all right.

1364
01:44:24,792 --> 01:44:28,353
You're safe now. It's okay.

1365
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:30,192
Ow, my leg.

1366
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,791
It's okay.

1367
01:44:32,867 --> 01:44:34,300
It's all right.

1368
01:45:46,178 --> 01:45:49,545
Was that the Boogey Man?

1369
01:45:51,883 --> 01:45:56,820
As a matter of fact, I do believe it was.

1370
01:46:01,126 --> 01:46:03,253
Jesus Christ! What the hell?

1371
01:46:04,564 --> 01:46:06,794
Michael, don't!

1372
01:46:09,969 --> 01:46:11,732
Michael, stop!

1373
01:46:15,108 --> 01:46:18,134
For God's sake, listen to me!

1374
01:46:18,211 --> 01:46:21,442
Look... it's not her fault.

1375
01:46:24,051 --> 01:46:25,609
Michael, it's my fault.

1376
01:46:25,686 --> 01:46:28,052
I failed you.

1377
01:46:28,122 --> 01:46:30,818
Please, let her go. Please.

1378
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:01,281
Open!

1379
