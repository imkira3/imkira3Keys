00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,541
It's so beautiful.

167
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,585
Where did you get it?

168
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,750
From my Dad.

169
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,088
He must really love you.

170
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,636
Yeah, he also feels guilty.

171
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,301
I was adopted.

172
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,261
Oh.

173
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,809
See, my biological father
was black.

174
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,223
You can tell by my hair.

175
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,930
My mom is my real mom...

176
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,399
But, you know,
when Darryl married her...

177
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,064
he adopted me.

178
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,312
I'm pretty sure
it was to make her happy.

179
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,610
No, I think he really cares
about you.

180
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,317
My dad didn't want me
anywhere around.

181
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,196
He'd get so pissed
if you tried to talk to him.

182
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,994
He'd throw stuff at me,
like food or spitballs.

183
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,207
Ugh.

184
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,497
Your dad read Hustler?

185
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,620
[laughs]
I don't think so.

186
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,293
Well, one day I went
through his room,

187
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,414
and I found all this stuff,

188
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,008
and he had, like, 500 magazines

189
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,254
of the kind with the chicks
in the high heels,

190
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,178
and, like, they like they look
like they're ready for a...exam.

191
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,597
Sordid. Come on.

192
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,639
Hey, I bet that's why
you look so sexy...

193
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,312
<i>so</i> that your dad
would notice you.

194
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,646
Thank you, Doctor.

195
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,564
- So did it work?
- Nope.

196
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,189
He left anyway.

197
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,903
I tried to commit suicide once.
See?

198
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,495
- Where?
- There.

199
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,739
Used to be a lot worse.

200
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,708
Oh, is my hair thing covered up?

201
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,327
Yeah. Why?

202
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,995
My parents.

203
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,545
I tried to convince them that
it was female pattern balding,

204
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,043
you know, that my hair fell out
in the shape of an eye,

205
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,966
but I don't think
they really bought it.

206
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,636
Whoa.

207
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,560
Um, it's too big.
You can never find anyone.

208
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,900
So, um,
how are you getting home?

209
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,818
Hitch.

210
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,280
Not everybody gets to go home
in a Mercedes.

211
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,240
Maybe I'll see you around.

212
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,860
Uh...

213
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,781
You know, I don't really
have many friends.

Um, well, yeah, any friends.

00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,296
Yeah. Everybody hates me.

Oh, well,
everybody hates me, too.

219
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,302
Um, so...

220
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,642
Do you want to come over?

221
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,476
Yeah.

222
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,020
We kind of have to be quiet.

223
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,436
My mom sleeps a lot.
She's got emphysema.

Oh.

225
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,272
Yeah, well,
I think it's to get attention.

226
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,690
She spends her life dying.

227
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,280
Do you got any booze?

Hi, PUPPY-

Oh, um, he really only likes me.
It's this weird loyalty thing.

Head Start.

I teach reading a couple nights
a week to some inner city kids.

Well, that's mighty white

Sorry.

244
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,021
I like pianos.

245
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,573
If I was to kill myself,
I'd like to fall,

246
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,698
just close my eyes
and pretend I was flying.

247
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,826
Yeah, with a big splat
at the end.

248
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,327
Well, you wouldn't feel it.

249
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,668
Yeah, but everybody'd stand
around looking at your insides.

250
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,710
Yeah, well, it's a lot faster
than slashing your wrists.

251
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,004
Who slashed their wrists?

252
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,720
Oh, Ivy, this is my mom Georgie.

253
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,309
Hi there, Georg--

254
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,099
Did she tell you
she slashed her wrists?

255

Oh, Sylvia.

256
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,027
I'll be right back.

257
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,867
Hand me the Percodan.

258
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,332
You never stop testing, do you?

259
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,008
What kind of girl
is impressed by suicide?

260
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,631
I like her.

261
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,508
She has a hole in her nose.

262
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,101
Yeah, well, a lot of girls do.

263
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,264
Leave it open.

264
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,938
It's supposed to rain tonight.

265
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,560
Then open it wider.

266
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,693
I'd think you'd be embarrassed.

267
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,815
What?

268
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,113
Getting caught lying
all the time.

269
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,704
Did you tell her
you're black, too?

270
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,082
You don't want me
to have any friends, do you?

271
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,747
People you have to lie to
so they like you

272
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,834
aren't worth your friendship.

273
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,210
Look, when I'm gone you...

274
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,085
you can play your music
as loud as you want.

275
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,136
Your dad can turn this room
into a study

276

with leather chairs
and dead animals on the wall,

277
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,882
but in the meantime,

278
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,976
you are not
gonna hang out with a girl

279
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,847
who has a naked woman
with a sword on her back.

280
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,144
What do you think
that says to the boys?

and I'll cut your dick off"?

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,866
- It's okay.
- Wait.

285
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,992
Look, I don't think your mom
wants me here right now.

286
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,459
Yeah, well, I want you here,
and she's sick,

287
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,000
and sometimes it makes her act
a little bit crazy.

288
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,755
She just cares about you.

289
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,295
Maybe I'll see you at school.

290
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,221
Do you go to Oakhurst, too?

291
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,090
Um, yeah. She has a scholarship.

292
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,015
I know.
I'm kind of out of place there.

293
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,146
I'm always out of place...

294
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,895
especially here.

00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,108
She's a good person.

Um, well, my aunt gets money
for letting me stay there.

00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,332
I get the picture.

303
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,963
Here. Let me.

304
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,676
What are you doing?

305
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,926
It was too low.

306
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,222
Try it now.

307
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,888
Aren't you afraid?

308
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,438
Of what?

309
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,392
Catching death.

310
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,527
Oh, Mom.

311
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,734
Energy never dies.

312
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,323
It just changes form.

313
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,612
Yeah, well...

314
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,028
you see if you're
ready to change form

315
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,825
when you're 38 years old.

316
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,789
Well, my mom died
in her forties...

317
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,629
but she was dead
way before that.

318
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,507
She only pretended to be alive.

319
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,461
She was so coked out
all the time,

320
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,134
looking out windows.

321
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,925
Every shadow was a cop
or a dealer she owed.

322
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,930
She was always asking
if I heard noises.

323
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,814
And she flinched
every time I touched her.

324
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,447
Even for a hug.

325
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,961
I bet you drove it with
the top down even in the rain.

326
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,008
Best time.

327
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,307
I hope that when I die...

328
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,843
