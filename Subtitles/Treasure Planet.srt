2
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:30,361
On the clearest of nights

3
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,199
when the winds of the Etherium
were calm and peaceful

4
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,469
the great merchant ships

5
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:48,540
with their cargoes
of Arcturian sura crystals

6
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:52,748
felt safe and secure

7
00:00:52,788 --> 00:00:56,485
Little did they suspect
that they were pursued by

8
00:00:57,993 --> 00:00:59,187
pirates

9
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,260
And the most feared
of all these pirates

10
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:08,463
was the notorious
Captain Nathaniel Flint

11
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:09,732
Fire!

12
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:16,742
Aah!

13
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:25,183
Like a Candarian zap-wing
ovetaking its prey--

14
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:28,856
WOMAN:
James Pleiades Hawkins

15
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:28,957
l thought you were asleep
an hour ago.

16
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,721
l thought you were asleep
an hour ago.

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,526
Mom, l was just getting
to the best part.

18
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:37,794
Please?

19
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,529
Oh, can those eyes
get any bigger?

20
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:43,166
Scootch over.

21
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:47,638
like
a Candarian zap-wing

22
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:49,667
ovetaking its prey

23
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,111
Flint
and his band of renegades

24
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:55,048
swooped in out of nowhere

25
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,626
Ha ha ha ha!

26
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,220
And then. gathering up
their spoils

27
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,997
vanished without a trace

28
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,763
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

29
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:17,101
Flint's secret trove
was never found

30
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:20,700
but stories have persisted
that it remains hidden

31
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:25,111
somewhere at the fathest
reaches of the galaxy

32
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:29,174
stowed with riches
beyond imagination--

33
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:32,483
the loot
of a thousand worlds

34
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:35,456
Treasure Planet

35
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,515
OK. Blow your nose.

36
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:43,560
How do you think
Captain Flint did it, Mom?

37
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,798
How'd he swoop in out of nowhere
and vanished without a trace?

38
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,930
l have no idea.

39
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:52,964
Come here, you, you li--

40
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:54,600
l'm gonna get--oh!

41
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:01,377
OK, now it's time for this
little spacer to go to sleep.

42
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,146
You think somebody'll
ever find Treasure Planet?

43
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:08,350
Sweetheart,
l think it's more...

44
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,449
like a legend.

45
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:12,619
l know it's real.

46
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:15,789
You win. lt's real.

47
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:19,759
-Nighty-night, Mom.
-Nighty-night, sweetheart.

48
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:23,102
l love you.

49
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:24,537
Love you, too.

50
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:33,306
There are nights when
the winds of the Etherium

51
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:37,682
so inviting in their promise
of flight and freedom

52
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,052
made one's spirit soar!

53
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,686
Yaaaa-hoo!

54
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:25,489
Whoo!

55
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:34,201
Come on!

56
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,836
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

57
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,847
Whoo-hoo!

58
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:49,614
Oh, great.

59
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:59,457
Mrs Hawkins!

60
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:01,724
l know--
refill on the purp juice.

61
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:03,094
Coming right up,
Mrs. Dunwiddie.

62
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:05,759
There we go. That's four
powdered spheroids...

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,598
two lunar eclipses,
and it's a big bowl...

64
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:10,900
of Zorellian jelly worms
for the big boy!

65
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:13,100
-Awesome!
-Enjoy.

66
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:19,070
Sorry, Delbert. lt's been
a madhouse here all morning.

67
00:05:19,113 --> 00:05:20,410
No problem, Sarah.

68
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:24,077
Ah! My Alponian chowder
with the extra solara seed.

69
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:25,915
Mmm! Yum!

70
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:29,217
Hello.

71
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:31,825
DOPPLER:
What brings you here

72
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:33,918
curious littleone?

73
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:41,896
Go away.

74
00:05:41,936 --> 00:05:43,870
Are your parents around?

75
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:47,497
What's the matter?
Cat got your--yaah!

76
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:51,605
Oh, they're so adorable
at that age.

77
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:53,739
Oh, yes...deplorable.

78
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:55,681
Uh...adorable! Hmm.

79
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:58,208
Speaking of which,
how's Jim doing?

80
00:05:58,252 --> 00:06:01,312
Much better. l know
he had some rough spots...

81
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:03,620
earlier this year,
but l really think...

82
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,250
that he's starting
to turn a corner.

83
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,124
Mrs. Hawkins?

84
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:08,458
Jim!

85
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,396
Ooh...wrong turn.

86
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,194
OK. Thanks for the lift, guys.

87
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,962
Not so fast.

88
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:15,629
We apprehended
your son operating...

89
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,262
a solar vehicle
in a restricted area.

90
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:19,398
Moving violation 9-0-4...

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,307
section fifteen,
paragraph, um...

92
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:23,469
Six?

93
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:24,978
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

94
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:27,140
-Jim!
-As you are aware, ma'am...

95
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:29,172
this constitutes a violation
of his probation.

96
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:32,880
Yes, yes. No, l understand.
Um, but could we just--

97
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,387
DOPPLER:
Um. ahem. pardon me

98
00:06:34,422 --> 00:06:37,914
Officers, if l might,
uh, interject here.

99
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,395
l am the noted astrophysicist
Dr. Delbert Doppler.

100
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:42,862
Perhaps you've heard of me.

101
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:45,161
No? Uh, l have a clipping.

102
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,895
-Are you the boy's father?
-Oh! Good heavens, no!

103
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:50,995
Eww! He's just an old friend
of the family.

104
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,472
Back off, sir!

105
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,873
Thank you, Delbert.
l will take it from here.

106
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,740
Well, Sarah, if you insist.

107
00:06:56,778 --> 00:06:59,246
Ahem. Don't ever let me
do that again.

108
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:01,372
Due to repeated violations
of statute 1 5-C...

109
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,408
we have impounded his vehicle.
Any more slip-ups will result...

110
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:06,010
in a one-way ticket
to Juvenile Hall.

111
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:07,851
-Kiddie hoosegow.
-The slammo.

112
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,518
Thank you, officers.
lt won't happen again.

113
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,117
We see his type
all the time, ma'am.

114
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:14,651
-Wrong choices.
-Dead-enders.

115
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:16,664
Losers

116
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:18,928
-You take care now.
-Let's motor.

117
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,875
Jim, l have had it.

118
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,208
Do you want to go
to Juvenile Hall? ls that it?

119
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:34,610
SARAH: Jim?

120
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:36,276
Jim, look at me.

121
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:38,308
lt's been hard enough
keeping this place...

122
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:40,217
afloat by myself
without you going--

123
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:42,449
Mom, it's no big deal.
There was nobody around.

124
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,186
Those cops just
won't get off my--

125
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:49,027
Forget it.

126
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:51,793
MRS DUNWDDE:
Mrs Hawkins! My juice!

127
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,233
Yes, l'll be right there,
Mrs. Dunwiddie.

128
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:56,065
Jim, l just don't want
to see you...

129
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:59,232
throw away your entire future.

130
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:03,209
Yeah, what future?

131
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:17,347
DR DOPPLER:  really don't
know how you manage it. Sarah

132
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:20,121
Trying to run a business
while raising a felon like--

133
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:23,995
felon...fellow...
fellow like Jim.

134
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:26,898
Managing it?
l'm at the end of my rope.

135
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:28,834
Ever since his father left

136
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,362
well. Jim's just
never recovered

137
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:34,636
And you know how smat he is

138
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:38,702
He built his first solar sufer
when he was eight!

139
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:41,180
And yet.
he's failing at school

140
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,274
he is constantly in trouble

141
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:46,115
and when  talk to him.
he's like a stranger to me

142
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:48,952
don't know. Delbet
've tried everything--

143
00:08:58,032 --> 00:08:59,499
Hey, Mister?

144
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:01,434
Mister,
you're OK in there, right?

145
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:02,959
Aah!

146
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,667
He's a-comin'.

147
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,676
Can you hear him?

148
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,702
Those gears and gyros
clickin' and whirrin'...

149
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:14,408
like the devil himself!

150
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:17,349
Uh, hit your head there
pretty hard, didn't ya?

151
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:18,977
He's after me chest...

152
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,354
that fiendish cyborg
and his band of cutthroats.

153
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:26,719
But they'll have to pry it...

154
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:32,893
from old Billy Bones' cold,
dead fingers afore l--argh!

155
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,036
Oh, my--

156
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,766
Uh, come on, give me your arm.

157
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:41,540
That's it.

158
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:47,472
-Good lad.
-Mom's gonna love this.

159
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:58,651
Thanks for listening, Delbert.

160
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:01,890
lt helps.

161
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:07,495
lt's going to be OK.

162
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:09,298
You'll see.

163
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:11,999
l keep dreaming one day
l'll open that door...

164
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:14,667
and there he'll be
just the way he was.

165
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:18,042
A smiling, happy little boy,
holding a new pet...

166
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,741
and begging me
to let him keep it.

167
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,675
James Pleiades Hawkins!

168
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,950
Mom, he's hurt...bad!

169
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,649
Me chest, lad.

170
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:38,026
BLLY BONES:
He'll be comin' soon

171
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,891
Can't let them find this.

172
00:10:41,936 --> 00:10:43,267
Who's coming?

173
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:46,398
The cyborg!

174
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,036
Beware the cyborg!

175
00:10:57,852 --> 00:10:59,012
Ohh!

176
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,065
Quick! We gotta go!

177
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,330
-Ohh!
-Aah!

178
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:17,496
l believe l'm with Jim
on this one!

179
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:30,277
Delilah! Hallelujah!

180
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:32,679
Stay! Don't move!

181
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,585
PRATE: Where is it?!

182
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,249
Find it!

183
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,621
DOPPLER:
Don't worry. Sarah

184
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:39,888
l'm an expert in the laws
of physical science.

185
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,986
-On the count of three--one...
-Three!

186
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:44,520
-Aah!
-Aah!

187
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:46,192
Go, Delilah! Go!

188
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:49,566
Go! That's it! That's it! Go!

189
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,004
Hyah! Hyah!

190
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:13,606
DOPPLER:  just spoke
with the constabulary

191
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:16,707
Those blaggard pirates
have fled without a trace

192
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,742
l'm sorry, Sarah.

193
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:23,882
l'm afraid the old Benbow lnn
has burned to the ground.

194
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:31,024
Ahem. Well, certainly
a lot of trouble...

195
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:34,227
over that odd little sphere.

196
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:36,964
Those markings baffle me

197
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:39,165
Unlike anything
've ever encountered

198
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:41,807
DOPPLER: Even with
my vast experience

199
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:43,309
and superior intellect

200
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:46,437
it would take me years
to unlock its--hey!

201
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:53,382
DOPPLER: Why, it's a map!

202
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:55,882
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

203
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:58,858
This is us,
the planet Montressor.

204
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:03,687
That's the Magellanic Cloud!

205
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,823
Whoo! The Coral Galaxy!

206
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:06,958
Oh!

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,127
DOPPLER:
That's the Cygnus Cross

208
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:11,603
and that's the Kerian Abyss.

209
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:15,074
Wait. What's this? What's this?
Why, it--it's...

210
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:16,939
Treasure Planet.

211
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:18,342
No!

212
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:20,312
That's Treasure Planet!

213
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:22,008
DOPPLER: Flint's trove?

214
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:24,017
The loot of a thousand worlds?

215
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:25,678
You know what this means?

216
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:29,177
lt means that all that treasure
is only a boat ride away.

217
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:32,749
Whoever brings it back
would hold an eternal place...

218
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:36,320
atop the pantheon of explorers!
He'd be able to experience--

219
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:38,763
Whoo! What just happened?

220
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,859
Mom, this is it. This is
the answer to all our problems.

221
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:44,132
Jim, there is
absolutely no way--

222
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:46,731
Don't you remember,
all those stories?

223
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:49,606
That's all they were--stories!

224
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:50,769
With that treasure...

225
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:53,439
we could rebuild the Benbow
a hundred times over!

226
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,176
Well, this is--
it's just--oh, my.

227
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:58,616
Delbert, would you please
explain how ridiculous this is?

228
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,950
lt's totally preposterous...

229
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:03,013
traversing
the entire galaxy alone.

230
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:05,115
SARAH: Now at last,
we hear some sense!

231
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,786
-That's why l'm going with you.
-Delbert!

232
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:10,228
l'll use my savings
to finance the expedition.

233
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:13,721
l'll commission a ship,
hire a captain and a crew.

234
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,064
You're not serious.

235
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:17,696
All my life l've been waiting
for an opportunity like this...

236
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:21,174
and here it is screaming,
''Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!''

237
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,336
OK. OK! You're both grounded!

238
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:27,512
JM: Mom. look

239
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:31,074
l know that l keep
messing everything up...

240
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:33,848
and l know...

241
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,878
that l let you down.

242
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,555
But this is my chance
to make it up to you.

243
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:43,256
l'm gonna set things right.

244
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:46,026
Sarah?

245
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:48,261
lf l may?

246
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,735
You said yourself,
you've tried everything.

247
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,398
There are much worse
remedies...

248
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:55,567
than a few character-building
months in space.

249
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:58,407
Are you saying this
because it's the right thing...

250
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,709
or because
you really want to go?

251
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:03,477
l really, really, really,
really want to go...

252
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:05,451
and it's the right thing.

253
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:14,120
Jim...

254
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:16,823
l don't want to lose you.

255
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:20,390
Mom...you won't.

256
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:22,595
l'll make you proud.

257
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:26,196
DOPPLER: Well. uh. ahem

258
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,797
There we are then.

259
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:30,077
We'll begin preparations
at once.

260
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:30,475
We'll begin preparations
at once.

261
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,810
Jim, my boy, soon we'll be
off to the spaceport.

262
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:18,323
DOPPLER:
Jim! Oh. Jim! Wait for me!

263
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:28,195
Well, Jim, this should be
a wonderful opportunity...

264
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:30,396
for the two of us
to get to know one another.

265
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:32,803
You know what they say,
familiarity breeds, um...

266
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,807
well, contempt,
but, in our case--

267
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:38,937
Look, let's just
find the ship. OK?

268
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:43,664
-Second berth on your right!
-You can't miss it.

269
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,974
Hey, thanks.

270
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:48,606
lt's the suit, isn't it?
l should never have listened...

271
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:51,014
to that pushy
two-headed saleswoman.

272
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,382
This one said it fit,
that one said it was my color.

273
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:56,445
l didn't know what to do.
l get so flustered. Ooh!

274
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,318
Oh, Jim! This is our ship!
The R.L.S. Legacy!

275
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,964
Whoa!

276
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,395
OFFCER:
Stow those casks foward!

277
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:14,906
Heave together now!

278
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:17,774
How cool is this?

279
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:20,808
Sorry about that.
l didn't mean--

280
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:27,447
Allow me to handle this.

281
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:37,028
l'm fluent in Flatula, Jim.

282
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:38,690
Took two years of it
in high school.

283
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,964
Flatula? Cool.

284
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,262
Good morning, Captain.
Everything shipshape?

285
00:17:47,306 --> 00:17:50,935
Shipshape it is, sir,
but l'm not the captain.

286
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:52,808
The captain's aloft.

287
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,981
Mr. Arrow, l've checked
this miserable ship...

288
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:06,458
from stem to stern,
and, as usual, it's...spot on.

289
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:08,517
Can you get nothing wrong?

290
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:10,927
You flatter me, Captain.

291
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:15,859
Ah, Dr. Doppler, l presume?

292
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:17,699
Uh, um, yes. l--

293
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:20,968
-Hello! Can you hear me?
-Yes, l can! Stop that banging!

294
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:23,669
lf l may, Doctor,
this works so much better...

295
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,836
when it's right-way up
and plugged in.

296
00:18:25,878 --> 00:18:28,005
-Ooh!
-Lovely. There you go.

297
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,675
lf you don't mind,
l can manage my own plugging!

298
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:31,842
l'm Captain Amelia...

299
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:33,686
late of a few run-ins
with the Protean armada.

300
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:35,881
Nasty business, but l won't
bore you with my scars.

301
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:37,685
You've met
my first officer, Mr. Arrow.

302
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:39,816
Sterling, tough, dependable,
honest, brave, and true.

303
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,486
Please, Captain.

304
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:43,495
Oh, shut up, Arrow. You know
l don't mean a word of it.

305
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:46,896
Ahem, excuse me. l hate to
interrupt this lovely banter...

306
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,401
but may l introduce to you,
Jim Hawkins?

307
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:52,734
Jim, you see, is the boy
who found the treasure--

308
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:54,933
Doctor, please!

309
00:18:57,543 --> 00:19:00,011
l'd like a word with you
in my stateroom.

310
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,708
Doctor, to muse and blabber
about a treasure map...

311
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:08,720
in front of
this particular crew...

312
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,984
demonstrates
a level of ineptitude...

313
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:13,184
that borders
on the imbecilic...

314
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:15,217
and l mean that
in a very caring way.

315
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:18,719
lmbecilic, did you say?
Foolishness, l've--

316
00:19:18,764 --> 00:19:20,391
May l see the map, please?

317
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,232
Here.

318
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:31,275
Hmm. Fascinating.

319
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:34,947
Mr. Hawkins, in the future...

320
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:36,881
you will address me
as ''Captain'' or ''Ma'am.''

321
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,042
ls that clear?

322
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:40,552
Ugh...

323
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:41,883
Mr. Hawkins?

324
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:45,891
-Yes, ma'am.
-That'll do.

325
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:48,223
Gentlemen, this must be kept
under lock and key...

326
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:51,025
when not in use.
And, Doctor, again...

327
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:52,758
with the greatest
possible respect...

328
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:54,823
zip your howling screamer.

329
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,528
Captain, l assure you l--

330
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:00,061
Let me make this
as monosyllabic as possible.

331
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:04,406
l don't much care
for this crew you hired.

332
00:20:04,443 --> 00:20:06,843
They're...how did l
describe them, Arrow?

333
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,211
l said something rather good
this morning before coffee.

334
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:13,548
''A ludicrous parcel
of driveling galoots,'' ma'am.

335
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:17,113
-There you go--poetry.
-Now, see here--

336
00:20:17,156 --> 00:20:21,320
Doctor, l'd love to chat--
tea, cake, the whole shebang--

337
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,691
but l have a ship to launch...

338
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,830
and you've got your outfit
to buff up.

339
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,162
Mr. Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes...

340
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,723
down to the galley
straightaway.

341
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:31,498
Young Hawkins will be working
for our cook, Mr. Silver.

342
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:33,971
What? The cook?

343
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,812
That woman! That...feline!

344
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,042
Who does she think
is working for whom?

345
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:42,414
lt's my map, and
she's got me bussin' tables?

346
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:45,181
l'll not tolerate a cross word
about our captain!

347
00:20:45,221 --> 00:20:49,555
There's no finer officer
in this or any galaxy.

348
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,655
ARROW: Mr Silver?

349
00:20:54,697 --> 00:20:56,927
Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.

350
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,366
Bringin' in such fine
and distinguished gents

351
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:01,370
to grace my humble galley.

352
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:03,872
Had l known,
l'd have tucked in me shirt.

353
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:05,339
Heh heh heh heh!

354
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,379
A cyborg!

355
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:12,643
May l introduce Dr. Doppler?

356
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:15,081
The financier of our voyage.

357
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:17,244
Love the outfit, Doc.

358
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:20,813
Well, thank you.
Um, love the eye.

359
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:23,586
Uh, this young lad
is Jim Hawkins.

360
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:26,786
Jimbo! Uh...

361
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:35,596
Aw, now, don't be too put off
by this hunk of hardware.

362
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:43,603
Whoa!

363
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:45,910
These gears have been
tough getting used to...

364
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:49,714
but they do come in
mighty handy from time to time.

365
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,489
Mmm!

366
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:04,625
Here, now, have a taste
of me famous bonzabeast stew.

367
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:07,736
Mmm! Delightfully tangy,
yet robust.

368
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:11,365
Mmm! Delightfully tangy,
yet robust.

369
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:13,967
SLVER: Old family recipe

370
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,101
Aah!

371
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:18,773
ln fact, that was part
of the old family!

372
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:21,783
Ha ha ha!

373
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:24,843
Oh, ho! l'm just kiddin', Doc!

374
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:26,218
Uh, yeah, well...

375
00:22:26,255 --> 00:22:28,780
l'm nothin'
if l ain't a kidder.

376
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:31,315
Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.

377
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:39,994
SLVER: Morph!

378
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:43,300
You jiggle-headed
blob of mischief!

379
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:45,830
So that's
where you was hiding!

380
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:53,344
Wha--? Ha!
What is that thing?

381
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:54,713
''What is that thing?''

382
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,547
SLVER: He's a morph

383
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:59,554
rescued the little
shape-shifter on Proteus 1

384
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:03,716
Aw, he took a shine to me.

385
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,523
We been together ever since.

386
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:09,395
Right? Yeah. Nice boy.

387
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,830
We're about to get underway.

388
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:12,993
Would you like to observe
the launch, doctor?

389
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:14,263
Would l?

390
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:17,966
Does an active galactic nucleus
have superluminal jets?

391
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:20,373
l'll follow you.

392
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:24,209
Mr. Hawkins will stay here
in your charge, Mr. Silver.

393
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:27,712
Beggin' your pardon, sir, but--

394
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,653
Captain's orders! See to it
the new cabin boy's kept busy.

395
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:35,452
-Aw, but, no, but--
-No, you can't--

396
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:43,888
So, Captain's
put you with me, eh?

397
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,798
Whatever.

398
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:51,238
Well, who be a humble cyborg
to argue with a captain?

399
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:53,571
Yeah.

400
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:56,601
You know...these purps...

401
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,911
they're kind of like the ones
back home on Montressor.

402
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,542
You ever been there?

403
00:24:02,585 --> 00:24:05,247
l can't say as l have, Jimbo.

404
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,484
Come to think of it,
just before l left...

405
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:11,550
l met this old guy,
who was, um...

406
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:14,961
he was kind of looking
for a cyborg buddy of his.

407
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,294
ls that so?

408
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:17,663
Yeah.

409
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,534
What was that
old salamander's name?

410
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,061
Oh, yeah. Bones.

411
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:26,040
Billy Bones?

412
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:29,169
Bones? Bones?!

413
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:31,509
Mm-mmm.
T'ain't ringin' any bells.

414
00:24:31,547 --> 00:24:33,811
Must have been
a different cyborg.

415
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:37,114
There's a slew of cyborgs
roamin' this port.

416
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:40,083
ARROW: Prepare to cast off!

417
00:24:40,122 --> 00:24:44,058
Eh, off with you, lad,
and watch the launch.

418
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:48,029
There'll be plenty work
a-waitin' for you afterwards.

419
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:58,637
We best be keepin' a sharp eye
on this one, eh, Morph?

420
00:24:58,674 --> 00:25:03,577
We wouldn't want him strayin'
into things he shouldn't.

421
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:06,813
We're all clear, Captain!

422
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:10,188
Well, my friend. Are we ready
to raise this creaking tub?

423
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,318
My pleasure, Captain.

424
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:15,353
All hands to stations!

425
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,724
ARROW: Smatly now!

426
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,324
Come on, you scurvy scum!
l'll race you!

427
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:26,336
Loose all solar sails!

428
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,606
Come on!

429
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,546
ARROW: Heave up the braces

430
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,386
Brace up

431
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,500
Ooh. Oh.

432
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,441
Mr. Zoff,
engage artificial gravity.

433
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,317
South by southwest,
Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.

434
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:15,221
Aye, Captain. 2-1-0-0.

435
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:19,787
Full speed, Mr. Arrow,
if you please.

436
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,125
Take her away!

437
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,227
Brace yourself, Doctor.

438
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:29,237
''Brace yourself.''

439
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,262
Aah! Oof!

440
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:51,618
Whoa.

441
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:12,475
Upon my word,
an Orcus Galacticus.

442
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:15,479
Smile.

443
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,075
Uh, Doctor, l'd stand clear--

444
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,913
Ha.

445
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:24,983
SLVER: Ah. 'tis a grand day
for sailing. Captain

446
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:26,460
and look at you

447
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:29,123
You're as trim and as bonny
as a sloop

448
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:31,962
with new sails
and a fresh coat of paint

449
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,831
You can keep that kind
of flim-flammery...

450
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:35,734
for your spaceport floozies,
Silver.

451
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:37,238
Spaceport floozy,
spaceport floozy--

452
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:39,672
You cut me to the quick,
Captain.

453
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,643
l speaks nothing
but me heart at all times.

454
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:43,905
MORPH: Nothing but me heat

455
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:46,743
And, by the way,
isn't that your cabin boy...

456
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:50,479
aimlessly footling about
in those shrouds?

457
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,146
Yep, it--oh...

458
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:57,215
A momentary aberration, Cap'n,
soon to be addressed. Jimbo!

459
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,491
l got two new friends
l'd like you to meet.

460
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:07,834
Say hello to Mr. Mop
and Mrs. Bucket.

461
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:09,803
Heh heh heh heh!

462
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:11,169
Yippie.

463
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,939
Yeah, l got your Mr. Mop.

464
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:20,944
Watch it, twerp.

465
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,458
What are you looking at,
weirdo?

466
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:40,894
Yeah, weirdo.

467
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:51,039
Cabin boys should learn
to mind their own business.

468
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,570
Why? You got something to hide,
bright eyes?

469
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,849
Maybe your ears
don't work so well.

470
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:01,856
Yeah. Ahem.

471
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,915
Too bad my nose works just fine.

472
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:07,952
Why, you impudent little--

473
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,728
Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!

474
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:17,731
Any last words, cabin boy?

475
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:21,440
Mr. Scroop...

476
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:26,945
you ever see what happens
to a fresh purp...

477
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:30,850
when you squeeze real hard?

478
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:34,521
ARROW: What's all this. then?

479
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,857
You know the rules.

480
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:42,523
There'll be no brawling
on this ship.

481
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:43,758
Aye, aye, sir.

482
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,495
Any further offenders
will be confined to the brig...

483
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,300
for the remainder
of the voyage.

484
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:53,967
Am l clear, Mr. Scroop?

485
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,115
Transparently.

486
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,387
SlLVER:
Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!

487
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:13,292
A tight ship's
a happy ship, sir.

488
00:30:14,462 --> 00:30:17,192
Jimbo, l gave you a job.

489
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,632
Hey, l was doing it
until that bug thing--

490
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:24,833
Belay that! Now, l want
this deck swabbed spotless...

491
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:28,434
and heaven help you if
l come back and it's not done.

492
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:32,173
Morph?
Keep an eye on this pup...

493
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:34,842
and let me know if there be
any more distractions.

494
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:36,043
OK Aye-aye

495
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:47,488
So, we're all here, then.

496
00:30:47,525 --> 00:30:50,756
-Excuse me.
-Fine.

497
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:57,261
Now, if you pardon
my plain speaking, gentlemen...

498
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:58,963
are you all...

499
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:02,701
stark-raving,
totally blinking daft?!

500
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:06,273
After all me finagling
getting us hired...

501
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,938
as an upstanding crew...

502
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:11,745
you want to blow the whole
mutiny before it's time?

503
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:14,752
The boy was sniffing about.

504
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:20,383
You just stick to the plan,
you bug-brained twit.

505
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:24,122
As for the boy,
l'll run him so ragged...

506
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:26,221
he won't have time to think.

507
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:39,436
Well, this has been
a fun day, huh?

508
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:43,937
Making new friends
like that spider psycho.

509
00:31:43,982 --> 00:31:45,916
Spider psycho, spider psycho.

510
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,781
Heh. A little uglier.

511
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:50,253
Mwah-ha-ha-ha!

512
00:31:50,288 --> 00:31:51,516
Pretty close.

513
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:52,818
SLVER: Well

514
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:55,849
thank heavens
for little miracles.

515
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:57,486
Up here for an hour...

516
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,827
and the deck's
still in one piece.

517
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:02,833
Um, look, l, uh...

518
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:06,268
What you did...

519
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,973
Thanks.

520
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,810
Didn't your pap
ever teach you...

521
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,143
to pick your fights
a bit more carefully?

522
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:23,946
Your father's
not the teachin' sort.

523
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:25,785
No.

524
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:29,954
He was more the taking off
and never coming back sort.

525
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:31,825
Oh.

526
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:36,165
Sorry, lad.

527
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:39,796
Hey, no big deal.
l'm doing just fine.

528
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:43,467
ls that so?

529
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:47,171
Well, since the captain
has put you in my charge...

530
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:49,373
like it or not,
l'll be pounding a few skills...

531
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:51,814
into that thick head of yours
to keep you out of trouble.

532
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,181
-What?
-From now on...

533
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:55,482
l'm not letting you
out of me sight.

534
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,646
You can't do--

535
00:32:56,754 --> 00:32:58,449
You won't so much
as eat, sleep...

536
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,584
or scratch your bum
without my say-so.

537
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:03,093
Don't do me any favors!

538
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:05,926
Oh, you can be sure of that,
my lad.

539
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:06,020
You can be sure of that.

540
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,318
You can be sure of that.

541
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:09,914
Heh heh heh heh!

542
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:16,519
Put some elbow into it.

543
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:31,609
#  am a question
to the world #

544
00:33:31,646 --> 00:33:34,877
# Not an answer
to be heard #

545
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:40,047
# Or a moment
that's held in your arms #

546
00:33:40,088 --> 00:33:44,650
# And what do you think
you'd ever say #

547
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:47,889
#  won't listen anyway #

548
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:49,624
# You don't know me #

549
00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:52,462
# And 'll never be
what you want #

550
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,900
# Made of pain #

551
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:04,069
# And what do you think
you'd understand? #

552
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:07,343
# 'm a boy. no. 'm a man #

553
00:34:07,382 --> 00:34:12,285
# You can take me
and throw me away #

554
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,121
# And how can you learn
what's never shown #

555
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:20,218
# Yeah. you stand here
on your own #

556
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:21,922
# They don't know me #

557
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:27,299
# 'Cause 'm not here #

558
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:31,294
# And  want a moment
to be real #

559
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:34,934
# Want to touch things
don't feel #

560
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:40,004
# Want to hold on
and feel  belong #

561
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:44,610
# And how can the world
want me to change #

562
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:47,746
# They're the ones
that stay the same #

563
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,882
# They don't know me #

564
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:54,361
# But 'm still here #

565
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:59,298
# And you see the things
they never see #

566
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:02,497
# All you wanted.
could be #

567
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:04,164
# Now you know me #

568
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:07,038
# And 'm not afraid #

569
00:35:07,075 --> 00:35:12,138
# And  want to tell you
who  am #

570
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,343
# Can you help me be a man? #

571
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:16,975
# They can't break me #

572
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:21,352
# As long as  know
who  am #

573
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:26,992
# They can't tell me
who to be #

574
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:34,793
# 'Cause 'm not
what they see #

575
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:36,827
# Yeah. the world
is still sleeping #

576
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:39,674
# While  keep on
dreaming for me #

577
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:41,539
# While  keep on
dreaming for me #

578
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:43,942
# And the words
are just whispers and lies #

579
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:49,610
# That 'll never believe #

580
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:56,085
# And  want a moment
to be real #

581
00:35:56,124 --> 00:35:59,184
# Want to touch things
don't feel #

582
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:02,924
# Want to hold on
and feel  belong #

583
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,261
Whoa!

584
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:08,962
# How can you say
never change? #

585
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,870
# They're the ones
that stay the same #

586
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:13,931
# 'm the one now #

587
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:18,742
# 'Cause 'm still here #

588
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,013
# 'm the one son still here #

589
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:27,385
# 'm still here #

590
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:31,415
# 'm still here #

591
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,798
Oh, ho ho!

592
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,170
You having
a little trouble there?

593
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,333
Oh, get away from me.

594
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,606
Oh, Jimbo.

595
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:59,014
lf l could maneuver a skiff
like that when l was your age...

596
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,178
they'd be bowing in the streets
when l walked by today.

597
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,345
Bowing in the streets.

598
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,786
-Oof.
-Oof.

599
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,687
l don't know.

600
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,785
They weren't exactly singing
my praises when l left home.

601
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,228
-Heh. Whew.
-Whew.

602
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:16,395
But l'm gonna change all that.

603
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,494
Are you now? How so?

604
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:23,200
Uh, l got some plans.

605
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,334
Gonna make people see me
a little different.

606
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,403
Ooh.

607
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:33,008
Sometimes, plans go astray.

608
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,416
Not this time.

609
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,977
Hmm.

610
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,926
Ooh...

611
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:47,353
Oh, thank you, Morphy.

612
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,036
So, uh,
how'd that happen anyway?

613
00:37:55,973 --> 00:38:01,275
You give up a few things
chasing a dream.

614
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,439
Was it worth it?

615
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,176
Heh.

616
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,253
l'm hoping it is, Jimbo.

617
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:13,779
l most surely am.

618
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,623
What the devil?

619
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,327
Good heavens.

620
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,802
The star Pelusa...

621
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,964
it's gone supernova!

622
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,236
Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle!

623
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,469
Aye-aye, Captain.

624
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,715
All hands,
fasten your lifelines!

625
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:55,496
Mr. Arrow, secure those sails!

626
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,933
Secure all sails!

627
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,596
Reef them down. men!

628
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,448
Yeah, baby! Ba-boom!
Ha ha ha ha!

629
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,750
-Aah!
-Silver!

630
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,629
Whoa. Thanks, lad.

631
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:54,519
Captain, the star!

632
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,719
lt's devolving into a...

633
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,696
a black hole!

634
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,791
We're being pulled in!
Ohh!

635
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,529
No, you don't, you--

636
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,577
Blast these waves!
They're so deucedly erratic!

637
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,844
No, Captain.
They're not erratic at all.

638
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:22,216
There'll be one more
in precisely 47.2 seconds.

639
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,915
Followed by the biggest
magilla of them all!

640
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:27,014
Of course! Brilliant, Doctor!

641
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,890
We'll ride that last magilla
out of here.

642
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,361
All sails secured, Captain!

643
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,923
Good man!
Now release them immediately!

644
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:40,199
Aye, Captain.
You heard her, men.

645
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,364
Unfurl those sails

646
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,964
-What?!
-But we just finished...

647
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:47,535
-Tying them down!
-Make up your blooming minds!

648
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:50,913
Mr. Hawkins...

649
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,907
make sure all lifelines
are secured good and tight!

650
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,419
Aye-aye, Captain.

651
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,595
Lifelines secured, Captain!

652
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,789
Very good!

653
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,032
Gaah! Whoa!

654
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,765
Oof!

655
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:26,506
Aah!

656
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,957
DOPPLER:
Captain. the last wave!

657
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,984
Here it comes!

658
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,087
Hold on to your lifelines,
gents!

659
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,496
lt's gonna be a bumpy ride!

660
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:01,549
Oof!

661
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:25,003
Captain! That--oh, my goodness.
That was--

662
00:42:25,038 --> 00:42:26,596
that was absolutely--
that was the most--

663
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,006
Oh, tish-tosh.
Actually, Doctor...

664
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:31,875
your astronomical advice
was most helpful.

665
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:35,575
Well, uh, uh--thank you.
Thank you very much.

666
00:42:35,615 --> 00:42:37,810
Well, l have a lot of help
to offer anatomically--

667
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:41,252
amanamonically--
as-astronomically.

668
00:42:41,288 --> 00:42:44,121
Well, l must congratulate you,
Mr. Silver.

669
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:45,283
lt seems your cabin boy...

670
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:47,850
did a bang-up job
with those lifelines.

671
00:42:49,462 --> 00:42:51,896
All hands accounted for,
Mr. Arrow?

672
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:56,095
Mr. Arrow?

673
00:42:58,171 --> 00:43:02,631
l'm afraid Mr. Arrow
has been lost.

674
00:43:04,678 --> 00:43:07,647
His lifeline was not secured.

675
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,244
No, l checked them all.

676
00:43:16,022 --> 00:43:19,617
l--l did. l checked them all.
They were secure.

677
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:21,388
l swear.

678
00:43:32,472 --> 00:43:35,566
Mr. Arrow was a...

679
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:39,807
Ahem. Fine spacer...

680
00:43:39,846 --> 00:43:43,782
finer than most of us
could ever hope to be...

681
00:43:45,285 --> 00:43:48,413
but he knew the risks,
as do we all.

682
00:43:48,455 --> 00:43:51,947
Resume your posts.
We carry on.

683
00:44:16,683 --> 00:44:18,378
lt weren't your fault,
you know?

684
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:26,120
Why, half the crew would be
spinning in that black abyss--

685
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,526
Look, don't you get it?!
l screwed up!

686
00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:31,530
For two seconds,
l thought that maybe...

687
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:33,930
l could do
something right, but--

688
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:37,061
Aagh! l just--

689
00:44:40,206 --> 00:44:43,232
Just forget it. Forget it.

690
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:53,818
Now, you listen to me,
James Hawkins.

691
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:57,289
You got the makings
of greatness in ya...

692
00:44:57,324 --> 00:45:00,657
but you gotta take the helm
and chart your own course.

693
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:04,152
Stick to it,
no matter the squalls...

694
00:45:04,197 --> 00:45:06,392
and when the time comes
you get the chance...

695
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:08,697
to really test
the cut of your sails...

696
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,298
and show what you're made of,
well, l hope l'm there...

697
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:18,903
catching some of the light
coming off ya that day.

698
00:45:31,157 --> 00:45:33,182
There, there.

699
00:45:33,226 --> 00:45:36,024
Lad, it's all right, Jimbo.

700
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:38,656
lt's all right.

701
00:45:42,068 --> 00:45:44,832
Now, Jim, l, um...

702
00:45:44,871 --> 00:45:47,396
l best be getting
about my watch...

703
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,500
and you best be getting
some shut-eye.

704
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:10,352
Getting in too deep here,
Morphy.

705
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:14,595
Next thing ya know, they'll be
saying l've gone soft.

706
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:47,207
Uh--oh! Oh! Ugh!

707
00:46:54,587 --> 00:46:55,986
Morph?

708
00:47:01,661 --> 00:47:05,188
Morph, knock it off.
lt's too early for this.

709
00:47:05,231 --> 00:47:06,721
Ow! Hey, Morph!

710
00:47:06,766 --> 00:47:08,097
Pbbbt!

711
00:47:10,904 --> 00:47:13,168
-Hey, come back here!
-Come back here!

712
00:47:17,076 --> 00:47:19,044
Gotcha, Morph!

713
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,183
That's it, you little squid.

714
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:26,185
You little squid.
You little squid.

715
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,210
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.

716
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:34,688
Ungh! Unh!

717
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,869
Ha! Busted!

718
00:47:49,676 --> 00:47:52,770
Look. what we're saying is
we're sick of all this waiting

719
00:47:52,812 --> 00:47:54,211
There's only
three of them left

720
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,408
We are wanting to move.

721
00:47:56,449 --> 00:47:59,384
We don't move till
we got the treasure in hand.

722
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:02,616
SCROOP:
say we kill 'em all now

723
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:06,216
l say what's to say!

724
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:07,920
Disobey my orders again...

725
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:10,020
like that stunt you pulled
with Mr. Arrow...

726
00:48:10,063 --> 00:48:13,132
and so help me,
you'll be joining him!

727
00:48:13,132 --> 00:48:13,621
and so help me,
you'll be joining him!

728
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:21,471
Strong talk,
but l know otherwise.

729
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:24,135
SLVER: You got
something to say. Scroop?

730
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:27,044
lt's that boy.

731
00:48:28,147 --> 00:48:33,107
Methinks you have
a soft spot for him.

732
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:35,313
SALORS: Yeah

733
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:38,449
Now, mark me, the lot of ya.

734
00:48:38,491 --> 00:48:42,154
l care about one thing,
and one thing only!

735
00:48:42,195 --> 00:48:44,720
Flint's trove.

736
00:48:44,764 --> 00:48:46,823
You think l'd risk it all
for the sake...

737
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:50,461
of some nose-wiping
little whelp?

738
00:48:50,503 --> 00:48:52,164
SCROOP: What was it now?

739
00:48:52,205 --> 00:48:57,108
''Oh. you got the makings
of greatness in ya ''

740
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,633
Shut your yap!

741
00:48:58,678 --> 00:49:03,172
l cozied up to that kid
to keep him off our scent.

742
00:49:03,216 --> 00:49:05,446
But l ain't gone soft.

743
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:07,476
ONUS: Land ho!

744
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,224
Ha ha ha! There it is!

745
00:49:16,262 --> 00:49:18,958
Feast eyes and click heels
if you got 'em.

746
00:49:27,306 --> 00:49:29,399
Where the devil's me glass?

747
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,111
Jimbo.

748
00:49:42,488 --> 00:49:46,424
Playing games, are we?

749
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:48,450
Yeah.

750
00:49:48,494 --> 00:49:50,553
Yeah, we're playing games.

751
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:57,559
Oh, l see. Well, l was never
much good at games.

752
00:49:57,603 --> 00:50:01,198
Always hated to lose.

753
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,208
Hmm.

754
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:04,209
Me, too!

755
00:50:04,243 --> 00:50:05,767
Yaaah!

756
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:10,775
Right-o...

757
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:17,680
SLVER: Ohhblast it all

758
00:50:22,128 --> 00:50:24,756
Change in plan, lads!

759
00:50:24,797 --> 00:50:26,924
We move now!

760
00:50:31,437 --> 00:50:34,463
Strike our colors, Mr. Onus.

761
00:50:34,507 --> 00:50:36,998
With pleasure, Captain.

762
00:50:51,357 --> 00:50:51,534
Pirates on my ship?
l'll see they all hang.

763
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:54,002
Pirates on my ship?
l'll see they all hang.

764
00:50:54,036 --> 00:50:55,162
Doctor, familiar with these?

765
00:50:56,372 --> 00:50:57,930
Oh, l've seen--
well, l've read--

766
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:00,938
Uh, no. No. No, l'm not.

767
00:51:02,111 --> 00:51:03,373
Ooh.

768
00:51:04,614 --> 00:51:07,674
Mr. Hawkins!
Defend this with your life.

769
00:51:07,717 --> 00:51:09,207
Morph! Give me that!

770
00:51:12,488 --> 00:51:15,286
Oh, you're taking
all day about it.

771
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:25,565
Oh! Stop them!

772
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:31,206
DOPPLER: Aah, aah, aah. Oof!

773
00:51:33,409 --> 00:51:34,376
Ooh hoo hoo!

774
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,877
Hey, you!

775
00:51:35,911 --> 00:51:38,209
To the longboats, quickly!

776
00:51:41,617 --> 00:51:42,982
Unh!

777
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:50,892
Rrr-yeah!

778
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:55,797
Morph! No!

779
00:51:59,802 --> 00:52:02,464
AMELlA: Chew on this,
you pus-filled boils!

780
00:52:08,944 --> 00:52:11,344
Did you actually aim for that?

781
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,007
You know, actually, l did.

782
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:21,384
Oh, blast it.

783
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,589
Doctor, when l say ''now'',
shoot out the forward cable.

784
00:52:25,628 --> 00:52:26,754
l'll take this one.

785
00:52:26,796 --> 00:52:28,457
JM: Morph. here! Morph!

786
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:32,193
Morph!

787
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:34,259
Morphy, come here.

788
00:52:34,303 --> 00:52:37,329
Morph. Morph. Bring it here.
Morph, come here.

789
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:39,807
Come here. Come here, boy.
Come to your dad.

790
00:52:39,842 --> 00:52:41,139
Come here, boy. Morph!

791
00:52:41,177 --> 00:52:43,441
-Come on!
-Morph! Morph, here!

792
00:52:43,479 --> 00:52:44,605
-Morphy!
-Morph!

793
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:46,911
Ohh.

794
00:52:57,026 --> 00:52:58,050
Now!

795
00:52:59,428 --> 00:53:00,417
Whoa!

796
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:03,031
Unh!

797
00:53:07,002 --> 00:53:08,299
Jim!

798
00:53:10,573 --> 00:53:12,871
Parameters met.
Hydraulics engaged.

799
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,635
That's it! Come to papa!

800
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:20,206
Hold your fire!
We'll lose the map!

801
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:24,052
Captain!
Laser ball at 1 2 o'clock!

802
00:53:33,129 --> 00:53:35,029
-Whoa!
-Aah!

803
00:53:52,948 --> 00:53:54,347
Ow.

804
00:53:54,383 --> 00:53:56,248
Oh, my goodness.

805
00:53:56,285 --> 00:53:58,651
That was more fun than
l ever want to have again.

806
00:53:58,687 --> 00:54:01,815
That's not one of my...

807
00:54:01,857 --> 00:54:04,417
gossamer landings. Unh!

808
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,087
Captain!

809
00:54:06,128 --> 00:54:08,528
Oh. Ooh.

810
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:09,963
Oh, don't fuss.

811
00:54:09,999 --> 00:54:11,523
Uh-uh--

812
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,194
Slight bruising. That's all.

813
00:54:13,235 --> 00:54:15,430
Cup of tea,
and l'll be right as rain.

814
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:16,631
Mr. Hawkins.

815
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,268
The map if you please.

816
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:23,100
Ah.

817
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,782
Morph!

818
00:54:26,782 --> 00:54:27,476
Morph!

819
00:54:27,516 --> 00:54:29,245
Morph, where's the map?!

820
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:34,780
Are you serious?!
lt's back on the ship?

821
00:54:36,158 --> 00:54:39,616
Stifle that blob and get low.

822
00:54:41,197 --> 00:54:43,597
CAPTAN AMELA:
We've got company

823
00:54:48,337 --> 00:54:51,033
We need
a more defensible position.

824
00:54:51,073 --> 00:54:53,234
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.

825
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,236
Aye, Captain.

826
00:54:56,278 --> 00:54:59,372
-Unh!
-Steady, steady.

827
00:54:59,415 --> 00:55:02,009
Now, let's have a look at that.

828
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:32,599
Shh. shh.

829
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:42,468
-Aah!
-Aah!

830
00:55:42,511 --> 00:55:44,035
Oh, this is fantastic!

831
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,105
A carbon-based life form
come to rescue me at last!

832
00:55:47,149 --> 00:55:49,140
l just want to hug you
and squeeze you...

833
00:55:49,184 --> 00:55:50,947
and hold you close to me.

834
00:55:50,986 --> 00:55:54,217
All right. OK.
Would you just let go of me?

835
00:55:54,256 --> 00:55:55,985
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

836
00:55:56,024 --> 00:55:59,619
lt's just l've been marooned
for so long.

837
00:55:59,661 --> 00:56:02,323
l mean, solitude's fine.
Don't get me wrong.

838
00:56:02,364 --> 00:56:04,195
For heaven's sakes,
after a hundred years...

839
00:56:04,232 --> 00:56:07,861
you go a little nuts!
Ha ha ha!

840
00:56:07,903 --> 00:56:09,666
l'm sorry. Am l...

841
00:56:09,704 --> 00:56:11,103
l am, um...

842
00:56:11,139 --> 00:56:14,768
My name is, uh...

843
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,380
B.E.N.! Of course, l'm B.E.N.

844
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:24,112
Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.

845
00:56:24,152 --> 00:56:25,779
-And you are?
-Jim.

846
00:56:25,821 --> 00:56:27,345
Oh, what a pleasure
to meet you, Jimmy.

847
00:56:27,389 --> 00:56:29,619
-lt's Jim.
-Anyway...

848
00:56:29,658 --> 00:56:31,125
Look, l'm kind of
in a hurry, OK?

849
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:33,753
l got to find a place to hide,
and there's pirates chasing me.

850
00:56:33,795 --> 00:56:36,992
Oh, pirates!
Don't get me started on pirates!

851
00:56:37,032 --> 00:56:40,092
l don't like them.
l remember Captain Flint.

852
00:56:40,135 --> 00:56:42,399
This guy had such a temper.

853
00:56:42,437 --> 00:56:44,530
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?

854
00:56:44,573 --> 00:56:47,508
l think he suffered
from mood swings, personally.

855
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,305
l'm not a therapist,
and anyway...

856
00:56:49,344 --> 00:56:51,471
but l--you let me know
when l'm rambling.

857
00:56:51,513 --> 00:56:52,844
But that means--but wait.

858
00:56:52,881 --> 00:56:55,247
But then you gotta know
about the treasure?

859
00:56:55,283 --> 00:56:56,944
-Treasure?
-Yeah, Flint's trove?

860
00:56:56,985 --> 00:56:58,953
You know,
loot of a thousand worlds.

861
00:56:58,987 --> 00:57:00,921
lt's--well, it's...

862
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:04,483
it's all a little--
little--little fuzzy.

863
00:57:04,526 --> 00:57:08,121
Wait. l--l r-r-remember.

864
00:57:08,163 --> 00:57:10,222
l do. l--treasure!

865
00:57:10,265 --> 00:57:13,166
Lots of treasure
buried in the centroid--

866
00:57:13,201 --> 00:57:15,226
centroid--centroid
of the mechanism.

867
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:18,535
And there was this big door
opening and closing...

868
00:57:18,573 --> 00:57:20,598
and opening and closing...

869
00:57:20,642 --> 00:57:22,234
and Captain Flint
wanted to make sure...

870
00:57:22,277 --> 00:57:23,869
nobody could ever
get to his treasure...

871
00:57:23,912 --> 00:57:26,904
so l helped him...

872
00:57:26,948 --> 00:57:29,508
Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!

873
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:31,746
JM: BEN ? BEN ? BEN !

874
00:57:31,786 --> 00:57:34,380
Reboot! Aah! And you are?

875
00:57:34,422 --> 00:57:35,787
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure?

876
00:57:35,824 --> 00:57:37,257
l want to say Larry.

877
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:39,453
The--the centroid
of the mechanism, or--

878
00:57:39,494 --> 00:57:42,657
l'm sorry. My memory
isn't what it used to be.

879
00:57:42,697 --> 00:57:42,764
l've lost my mind. Ha ha!
l've lost my mind.

880
00:57:42,764 --> 00:57:45,790
l've lost my mind. Ha ha!
l've lost my mind.

881
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:47,267
You haven't found it, have you?

882
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:50,999
Uh, my missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?

883
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,567
Look, B.E.N., l really need
to find a place to hide, OK?

884
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:59,637
So l'm just gonna be,
you know, moving on.

885
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:03,139
Oh, uh, so, well, then...

886
00:58:03,185 --> 00:58:07,053
l guess, uh...
this is good-bye, huh?

887
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:11,991
l'm sorry that
l'm so dysfunctional.

888
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:17,055
So, uh, go ahead and...
l do understand.

889
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:20,556
l do. Bye-bye.

890
00:58:23,705 --> 00:58:26,173
Look,
if you're gonna come along...

891
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:27,903
you're gonna have
to stop talking.

892
00:58:27,943 --> 00:58:31,538
Huzzah! Ha ha ha!
Oh, this is fantastic!

893
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,346
Me and my best buddy
are lookin' for a...

894
00:58:36,952 --> 00:58:38,852
Being quiet.

895
00:58:38,887 --> 00:58:41,185
And you have to stop
touching me.

896
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:44,886
Touching and talking.
That's my two big no-nos.

897
00:58:44,926 --> 00:58:46,985
OK. Now, l think
that we should--

898
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:50,122
Say, listen, before we go out
on our big search...

899
00:58:50,165 --> 00:58:54,659
um, would you mind if we made
a quick pit stop at my place?

900
00:58:54,703 --> 00:58:56,671
Kind of urgent.

901
00:58:56,705 --> 00:59:00,232
JM: BEN.  think
you just solved my problem

902
00:59:04,346 --> 00:59:06,280
BEN:
Uh. pardon the mess. people

903
00:59:06,314 --> 00:59:07,440
You'd think
in a hundred years...

904
00:59:07,482 --> 00:59:09,313
l would've dusted
a little more often...

905
00:59:09,351 --> 00:59:11,683
but, you know,
when you're batchin' it...

906
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,314
you tend to, uh, let things go.

907
00:59:14,356 --> 00:59:16,586
Aw, isn't that sweet?

908
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:19,890
l find old-fashioned romance
so touching, don't you?

909
00:59:19,928 --> 00:59:21,759
How about drinks
for the happy couple?

910
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:23,957
Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.

911
00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:25,899
Thank you, we don't drink...

912
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:28,198
and, uh, we're not a couple.

913
00:59:30,272 --> 00:59:32,740
Ahem.
Look at these markings.

914
00:59:32,774 --> 00:59:36,107
They're identical
to the ones on the map.

915
00:59:36,144 --> 00:59:38,271
l suspect these are
the hieroglyphic remnants...

916
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:40,042
of an ancient culture.

917
00:59:40,081 --> 00:59:41,571
CAPTAN AMELA: Mr Hawkins

918
00:59:41,616 --> 00:59:44,551
stop anyone
who tries to approach. Ohh!

919
00:59:44,586 --> 00:59:46,144
Yes, yes. Now listen to me...

920
00:59:46,187 --> 00:59:50,385
stop giving orders for a few
milliseconds and lie still.

921
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:52,518
Very forceful, Doctor.

922
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,619
Go on. Say something else.

923
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:54,833
BEN: Hey. look! There's
some more of your buddies!

924
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:58,064
BEN: Hey. look! There's
some more of your buddies!

925
00:59:58,103 --> 01:00:01,072
Hey, fellas!
We're over here, fellas!

926
01:00:01,106 --> 01:00:04,200
Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!

927
01:00:06,277 --> 01:00:10,475
Stop wastin' your fire!

928
01:00:11,516 --> 01:00:14,007
SLVER: Hello. up there!

929
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:18,216
Jimbo?

930
01:00:18,256 --> 01:00:21,623
lf it's all right
with the captain...

931
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,560
l'd like a short word with ya.

932
01:00:24,596 --> 01:00:28,191
No tricks,
just a little palaver.

933
01:00:28,233 --> 01:00:30,929
Come to bargain for the map,
doubtless.

934
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:32,095
Pestilential...

935
01:00:32,137 --> 01:00:34,196
-Ugh!
-Captain.

936
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:39,677
That means...that he thinks
we still have it.

937
01:00:44,582 --> 01:00:50,521
Ah, Morphy! l wondered
where you was off to.

938
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:55,387
Ooh.

939
01:00:55,426 --> 01:00:58,725
Oh, this poor old leg's
downright snarky...

940
01:00:58,763 --> 01:01:01,732
since that game attack
we had in the galley.

941
01:01:03,835 --> 01:01:05,427
Ahh.

942
01:01:07,505 --> 01:01:10,440
Whatever you heard
back there...

943
01:01:10,475 --> 01:01:12,739
at least the part
concerning you...

944
01:01:12,777 --> 01:01:16,645
l didn't mean a word of it.

945
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:20,811
Had that bloodthirsty lot
thought l'd gone soft...

946
01:01:20,852 --> 01:01:23,286
they'd have gutted us both.

947
01:01:25,423 --> 01:01:29,951
Listen to me.
lf we play our cards right...

948
01:01:29,994 --> 01:01:35,296
we can both walk away
from this rich as kings.

949
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:37,767
-Yeah?
-Ha ha ha.

950
01:01:37,802 --> 01:01:40,896
You get me that map...

951
01:01:40,939 --> 01:01:42,702
and, uh...

952
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:47,234
an even portion
of the treasure is yours.

953
01:01:52,951 --> 01:01:55,283
Boy.

954
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,982
You are really something.

955
01:01:58,022 --> 01:02:00,718
All that talk of greatness...

956
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:04,353
light coming off my sails...
what a joke.

957
01:02:04,395 --> 01:02:06,192
Now, just see here, Jimbo--

958
01:02:06,231 --> 01:02:07,459
l mean, at least
you taught me one thing.

959
01:02:07,498 --> 01:02:08,863
Stick to it, right?

960
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,868
Well, that's just
what l'm gonna do.

961
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:12,529
l'm gonna make sure
that you never see...

962
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,198
one drabloon of my treasure!

963
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,767
That treasure is owed me,
by thunder!

964
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:23,179
Well, try to find it
without my map, by thunder!

965
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:28,311
Oh, you still don't know how to
pick your fights, do you, boy?

966
01:02:28,353 --> 01:02:31,789
Now, mark me.

967
01:02:31,823 --> 01:02:35,452
Either l get that map
by dawn tomorrow...

968
01:02:35,493 --> 01:02:39,623
or so help me,
l'll use the ship's cannons...

969
01:02:39,664 --> 01:02:43,464
to blast ya all
to kingdom come!

970
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:46,527
Morph, hop to it.

971
01:02:47,905 --> 01:02:49,372
Now!

972
01:02:51,943 --> 01:02:53,706
Oh, blast it!

973
01:03:05,356 --> 01:03:07,153
Gentlemen...

974
01:03:07,191 --> 01:03:11,127
we must stay together and...

975
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,993
and...ohh.

976
01:03:13,031 --> 01:03:14,828
And what? What?!

977
01:03:14,866 --> 01:03:17,391
We must stay together
and what?!

978
01:03:17,435 --> 01:03:22,930
Doctor,
you have wonderful eyes.

979
01:03:22,974 --> 01:03:24,566
She's lost her mind!

980
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:25,837
Well, you gotta help her.

981
01:03:25,877 --> 01:03:28,209
Dang it, Jim. l'm an astronomer,
not a doctor.

982
01:03:28,246 --> 01:03:30,612
l mean, l am a doctor,
but l'm not that kind of doctor.

983
01:03:30,648 --> 01:03:32,275
l have a doctorate.
lt's not the same thing.

984
01:03:32,317 --> 01:03:33,784
You can't help people
with a doctorate.

985
01:03:33,818 --> 01:03:36,343
You just sit there,
and you're useless.

986
01:03:36,387 --> 01:03:38,651
lt's OK, Doc.

987
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,419
lt's all right.

988
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:43,859
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows exactly
how to get out of this.

989
01:03:43,895 --> 01:03:47,023
lt's just Jimmy
has this knowledge of things.

990
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:50,692
Jim, any thoughts at all?

991
01:03:50,735 --> 01:03:53,829
Without the map, we're dead.

992
01:03:55,006 --> 01:03:57,839
lf we try to leave, we're dead.

993
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,866
-lf we stay here--
-We're dead!

994
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:01,378
We're dead! We're dead!

995
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:10,180
Well, l think that Jimmy could
use a little quiet time. Heh.

996
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,452
So l'll just slip out
the back door.

997
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:15,686
-Back door?
-Oh, yeah.

998
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,887
l get this delightful breeze
through here...

999
01:04:17,929 --> 01:04:19,191
which l think is important...

1000
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,629
because ventilation
among friends--

1001
01:04:20,665 --> 01:04:23,225
Whoa What is all this stuff?

1002
01:04:23,267 --> 01:04:25,531
You mean the miles and miles
of machinery that run

1003
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,800
through the entire course
of the inside of this planet?

1004
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:29,533
Not a clue.

1005
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,974
Hey, Doc! Doc! l think
l found a way out of here!

1006
01:04:32,009 --> 01:04:34,477
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay--

1007
01:04:34,512 --> 01:04:37,413
-l'll be back.
-Cannonball!

1008
01:04:37,448 --> 01:04:39,040
Woof.

1009
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:49,816
-So, what's the plan?
-Shh. B.E.N., quiet.

1010
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,296
OK, here it is.

1011
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:58,860
We sneak back to the Legacy,
disable the laser cannons...

1012
01:04:58,903 --> 01:05:00,564
and bring back the map.

1013
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,833
That's a good plan.

1014
01:05:01,872 --> 01:05:03,464
l like that plan.
The only thing is...

1015
01:05:03,507 --> 01:05:05,941
l'm wondering,
how do we get there?

1016
01:05:05,977 --> 01:05:07,410
On that.

1017
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,606
MORPH: Ooh.

1018
01:05:13,851 --> 01:05:16,183
Oop?

1019
01:05:18,656 --> 01:05:20,089
-Aah!
-BEN. shh!

1020
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:23,184
Sorry. sorry Sorry

1021
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,296
OK, l'll get the map.
You wait here.

1022
01:05:32,336 --> 01:05:34,998
Roger, Jimmy. l'll neutralize
laser cannons, sir!

1023
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,506
B.E.N.! B.E.N.!

1024
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,338
# Yo-ho. yo-ho.
a pirate's life for me #

1025
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,638
Disable a few laser cannons.
What is the big deal?

1026
01:05:45,683 --> 01:05:48,379
All we gotta do is find
that one little wire.

1027
01:05:48,419 --> 01:05:52,082
Oh, mama.

1028
01:05:56,927 --> 01:05:58,656
Yes.

1029
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:01,828
Bad, B.E.N. Bad.

1030
01:06:01,866 --> 01:06:02,992
OK, fixing.

1031
01:06:03,034 --> 01:06:06,003
That stupid robot's
gonna get us all...killed.

1032
01:06:06,037 --> 01:06:08,301
Cabin boy.

1033
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,178
Aah!

1034
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:38,066
BEN:
Whoops OK. don't panic

1035
01:06:38,102 --> 01:06:40,434
Breathing in
breathing out

1036
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,345
-Aah!
-Hmm?

1037
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,150
Raah!

1038
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:03,450
This has gotta be cannons.

1039
01:07:04,962 --> 01:07:06,020
Maybe not.

1040
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:14,565
Rraar!

1041
01:07:22,012 --> 01:07:24,503
Heh heh.

1042
01:07:28,853 --> 01:07:31,185
Come on, come on, come on.

1043
01:07:31,222 --> 01:07:32,883
No!

1044
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:35,187
Oh, yes.

1045
01:07:35,226 --> 01:07:38,354
Do say hello to Mr. Arrow.

1046
01:07:40,297 --> 01:07:42,026
Rraar!

1047
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:43,897
Tell him yourself!

1048
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:52,167
Aah!

1049
01:07:53,644 --> 01:07:56,875
Back you go, you naughty plug!
Oh!

1050
01:07:56,914 --> 01:07:59,974
Unh!

1051
01:08:06,557 --> 01:08:08,184
Morph?

1052
01:08:08,225 --> 01:08:09,886
BEN:
Laser cannons disconnected

1053
01:08:09,927 --> 01:08:11,485
Captain Jimmy, sir!

1054
01:08:11,529 --> 01:08:13,622
Gee, that wasn't so tough.

1055
01:08:21,912 --> 01:08:23,641
Doc! Doc, wake up!

1056
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,877
l got the map.

1057
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:32,184
Fine work, Jimbo.
Fine work indeed.

1058
01:08:36,326 --> 01:08:39,124
Thanks for showing us
the way, boy.

1059
01:08:42,566 --> 01:08:44,466
Aah!

1060
01:08:47,237 --> 01:08:49,637
What's this sorry stack
of metal?!

1061
01:08:49,673 --> 01:08:50,970
Not the face!

1062
01:08:51,008 --> 01:08:53,875
You're just like me, Jimbo.

1063
01:08:53,911 --> 01:08:57,005
Ya hates to lose.

1064
01:09:05,389 --> 01:09:07,755
What the devil's the...

1065
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:13,456
Open it.

1066
01:09:22,172 --> 01:09:24,538
l'd get busy.

1067
01:09:41,158 --> 01:09:44,787
Oh, the powers that be.
Would you look?

1068
01:09:48,999 --> 01:09:51,194
Ha ha ha ha!

1069
01:09:51,235 --> 01:09:55,228
Tie him up and leave him
with the others till we--what?

1070
01:09:56,306 --> 01:09:57,864
You want the map...

1071
01:09:57,908 --> 01:09:59,739
you're taking me, too.

1072
01:10:03,113 --> 01:10:04,580
Hmm.

1073
01:10:07,718 --> 01:10:09,549
We'll take 'em all.

1074
01:10:21,298 --> 01:10:23,061
Unh.

1075
01:10:31,909 --> 01:10:34,605
lt's OK, Morph. lt's OK.

1076
01:10:34,645 --> 01:10:36,545
Jimmy,
l--l don't know about you...

1077
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:40,414
but l'm starting to see my life
pass in front of my eyes.

1078
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:42,441
At least, l think it's my life.

1079
01:10:42,486 --> 01:10:45,614
Was l ever dancing
with an android named Lupe?!

1080
01:10:45,656 --> 01:10:47,783
B.E.N., shh.

1081
01:10:47,824 --> 01:10:49,985
This isn't over yet.

1082
01:10:51,195 --> 01:10:53,663
SLVER:
We're gettin' close. lads

1083
01:10:53,697 --> 01:10:56,962
l smell treasure a-waitin'.

1084
01:11:02,206 --> 01:11:03,332
Huh?

1085
01:11:03,373 --> 01:11:05,432
SLVER: Where is it?

1086
01:11:05,475 --> 01:11:09,969
l see nothing! One great, big
stinking hunk of nothing!

1087
01:11:10,013 --> 01:11:12,914
What's going on, Jimbo?

1088
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:15,817
l don't know.
l can't get it open.

1089
01:11:15,852 --> 01:11:18,548
We should've never
followed this boy!

1090
01:11:18,589 --> 01:11:20,022
Hey!

1091
01:11:20,057 --> 01:11:21,820
SLVER: 'd suggest you get

1092
01:11:21,858 --> 01:11:23,985
that gizmo going again.
and fast!

1093
01:11:24,027 --> 01:11:27,326
Let's rip his gizzard
right out right now!

1094
01:11:27,364 --> 01:11:29,992
Throw him off the cliff!

1095
01:11:51,088 --> 01:11:53,488
Oh, have mercy.

1096
01:11:54,925 --> 01:11:57,291
JM: The Lagoon Nebula?

1097
01:11:57,327 --> 01:12:00,888
But that's halfway
across the galaxy.

1098
01:12:02,599 --> 01:12:05,067
JM: A big door

1099
01:12:05,102 --> 01:12:07,229
opening and closing

1100
01:12:11,141 --> 01:12:12,938
Let's see.

1101
01:12:12,976 --> 01:12:16,434
Kinapis.

1102
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,107
Montressor spaceport.

1103
01:12:21,318 --> 01:12:23,286
So that's how Flint did it.

1104
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:28,519
He used this portal to roam
the universe stealing treasure.

1105
01:12:28,558 --> 01:12:30,958
But where'd he stash it all?

1106
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:35,392
SLVER: Where's
that blasted treasure?!

1107
01:12:35,432 --> 01:12:37,593
Treasure! Treasure!

1108
01:12:37,634 --> 01:12:39,625
lt's buried in the--

1109
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:44,004
Buried in the centroid
of the mechanism.

1110
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:47,841
What if the whole planet
is the mechanism...

1111
01:12:47,878 --> 01:12:52,144
and the treasure is buried
in the center of this planet?

1112
01:12:55,852 --> 01:12:58,878
And how in blue blazes
are we supposed to get there?

1113
01:12:58,922 --> 01:13:02,380
Just open the right door.

1114
01:13:19,112 --> 01:13:22,411
Wait for me! Wait for me!

1115
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:35,561
The loot of a thousand worlds.

1116
01:13:38,532 --> 01:13:41,695
CREATURE: We are going
to need a bigger boat!

1117
01:13:54,147 --> 01:13:57,446
This is all seeming
very familiar.

1118
01:13:59,486 --> 01:14:03,081
can't remember why

1119
01:14:03,123 --> 01:14:04,420
B.E.N., come on.

1120
01:14:04,457 --> 01:14:06,891
We're getting out of here, and
we're not leaving empty-handed.

1121
01:14:06,927 --> 01:14:09,088
But--but, Jimmy! Jimmy!

1122
01:14:10,497 --> 01:14:14,126
A lifetime of searching.

1123
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:17,227
And at long last...

1124
01:14:18,338 --> 01:14:21,102
l can touch it.

1125
01:14:21,141 --> 01:14:22,335
Do you know what's strange?

1126
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,275
l can't tell you how
frustrating this is, Jimmy...

1127
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:25,801
'cause there's something just--

1128
01:14:25,845 --> 01:14:27,938
it's nagging
at the back of my mind.

1129
01:14:27,981 --> 01:14:29,676
Aah!

1130
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:33,208
-Captain Flint?
-ln the flesh!

1131
01:14:33,253 --> 01:14:37,053
Well, s-sort of,
except for skin, organs...

1132
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:39,786
or anything that--that--that
resembles flesh...

1133
01:14:39,826 --> 01:14:41,817
that's not there.

1134
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:43,920
And yet it's so odd. you know?

1135
01:14:43,964 --> 01:14:47,024
remember there was
something horrible

1136
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:49,126
Flint didn't want
anyone else to know

1137
01:14:49,169 --> 01:14:53,162
but -- just can't
remember what it was

1138
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:56,573
Oh, a mind
is a terrible thing to lose!

1139
01:14:58,745 --> 01:15:01,236
B.E.N.,
l think l just found your mind.

1140
01:15:01,281 --> 01:15:02,475
Hold still.

1141
01:15:02,515 --> 01:15:05,712
Aah! Jimmy, your hands
are very, very cold.

1142
01:15:07,487 --> 01:15:09,216
Whoa!

1143
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:11,156
Hello.

1144
01:15:11,191 --> 01:15:13,785
You know, uh, Jimmy,
l was just thinking...

1145
01:15:13,827 --> 01:15:16,352
l was just think--

1146
01:15:16,396 --> 01:15:19,422
lt's all flooding back!
All my memories!

1147
01:15:19,466 --> 01:15:21,195
Right up until Flint
pulled my memory circuits...

1148
01:15:21,234 --> 01:15:24,135
so l could never tell anybody
about his booby trap!

1149
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:28,397
-Speaking of which...
-Huh?

1150
01:15:30,343 --> 01:15:31,469
Flint wanted to make sure...

1151
01:15:31,511 --> 01:15:32,910
that nobody could ever
steal his treasure...

1152
01:15:32,946 --> 01:15:34,208
so he rigged
this whole planet...

1153
01:15:34,247 --> 01:15:37,546
to blow higher than
a Kalepsian kite!

1154
01:15:48,328 --> 01:15:50,228
Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!

1155
01:15:50,263 --> 01:15:51,787
You go back and help
the captain and Doc!

1156
01:15:51,831 --> 01:15:55,164
lf l'm not there in 5 minutes,
leave without me.

1157
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:58,364
l am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.

1158
01:15:58,405 --> 01:16:01,533
Unless he looks at me
like that.

1159
01:16:01,574 --> 01:16:02,905
Bye, Jim!

1160
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:12,817
No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1161
01:16:12,852 --> 01:16:13,978
No! Aah!

1162
01:16:15,755 --> 01:16:19,486
-Aah!
-Aah!

1163
01:16:23,463 --> 01:16:26,193
Come back here, ya blighters!

1164
01:16:41,648 --> 01:16:45,982
All my life, l dreamed
of an adventure like this.

1165
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:48,010
l'm just sorry...

1166
01:16:48,054 --> 01:16:51,251
l couldn't have been
more helpful to you.

1167
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:53,259
Oh, don't be daft.

1168
01:16:53,293 --> 01:16:57,024
You've been very helpful.
Truly.

1169
01:16:57,063 --> 01:17:02,262
l feel like such
a useless weakling...

1170
01:17:02,302 --> 01:17:04,862
with abnormally thin wrists.

1171
01:17:04,904 --> 01:17:07,099
Excuse me, brutish pirate.

1172
01:17:08,308 --> 01:17:10,105
Yes, you. l have a question.

1173
01:17:10,143 --> 01:17:12,373
ls it that your body
is too massive...

1174
01:17:12,412 --> 01:17:13,936
for your teeny-tiny head...

1175
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:16,414
or is it that your head
is too teeny-tiny...

1176
01:17:16,449 --> 01:17:19,316
for your big, fat body?

1177
01:17:19,352 --> 01:17:21,445
l pummel you good!

1178
01:17:21,488 --> 01:17:23,786
Yes, l'm sure you will,
but before you do...

1179
01:17:23,823 --> 01:17:26,849
l have one more question.
ls this yours?

1180
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,292
Uhh...

1181
01:17:35,101 --> 01:17:37,296
Yes!
Morph, we are so out of here!

1182
01:17:38,805 --> 01:17:40,295
SLVER: Ah. Jimbo!

1183
01:17:41,508 --> 01:17:45,342
Aren't you the seventh wonder
of the universe?

1184
01:17:45,378 --> 01:17:47,812
Get back!

1185
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:55,854
l like you, lad,
but l've come too far...

1186
01:17:55,889 --> 01:17:58,255
to let you stand
between me and me treasure.

1187
01:18:03,329 --> 01:18:04,956
Aah!

1188
01:18:18,178 --> 01:18:20,874
Oh, no, you don't!

1189
01:18:29,589 --> 01:18:30,783
What?

1190
01:18:34,928 --> 01:18:36,327
Jimbo.

1191
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,326
Reach for me now!

1192
01:18:41,367 --> 01:18:44,336
Reach!

1193
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:46,133
l--l can't!

1194
01:18:46,172 --> 01:18:48,732
Aah!

1195
01:18:54,948 --> 01:18:56,643
l...

1196
01:19:01,221 --> 01:19:06,352
Oh, blast me for a fool!

1197
01:19:06,392 --> 01:19:07,916
Aah!

1198
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:30,922
Silver, you gave up?

1199
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,828
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.
l'll get over it.

1200
01:19:34,864 --> 01:19:36,695
BEN: Aloha. Jimmy!

1201
01:19:39,002 --> 01:19:40,833
Hurry, people!
We got exactly two minutes...

1202
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:43,862
and thirty-four seconds
till planet's destruction!

1203
01:19:43,906 --> 01:19:45,203
You're doing fine, Doctor.

1204
01:19:45,241 --> 01:19:47,471
Now ease her over
gently--gently!

1205
01:19:48,845 --> 01:19:53,043
Aah! We were better off
on exploding planet!

1206
01:19:55,418 --> 01:19:57,283
Take us out of here, metal man!

1207
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,810
Aye, Captain!

1208
01:20:02,425 --> 01:20:05,223
Captain, you dropped from
the heavens in the nick of--

1209
01:20:05,261 --> 01:20:07,991
Save your claptrap
for the judge, Silver!

1210
01:20:18,408 --> 01:20:20,069
Missile tail demobilized,
Captain!

1211
01:20:20,109 --> 01:20:21,872
Thrusters at only 30%
of capacity.

1212
01:20:21,911 --> 01:20:23,845
30% ? That means we're--

1213
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,974
We'll never clear
the planet's explosion in time.

1214
01:20:34,857 --> 01:20:37,758
-We gotta turn around.
-What?

1215
01:20:37,794 --> 01:20:40,695
There's a portal back there.
lt can get us out of here!

1216
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:43,028
DOPPLER: Pardon me. Jim.
but didn't that potal open

1217
01:20:43,066 --> 01:20:45,227
onto a raging inferno?!

1218
01:20:45,268 --> 01:20:48,237
Yes, but l'm gonna change that.

1219
01:20:48,271 --> 01:20:50,933
'm gonna open
a different door

1220
01:20:52,275 --> 01:20:53,572
Captain, really, l don't see
how this is possible--

1221
01:20:53,609 --> 01:20:55,770
Listen to the boy!

1222
01:20:55,812 --> 01:20:58,372
One minute, twenty-nine seconds
till planet's destruction!

1223
01:20:58,414 --> 01:21:01,906
-What do you need, Jim?
-Just some way to attach this.

1224
01:21:01,951 --> 01:21:04,442
All right. Stand back.
Stand back, now.

1225
01:21:06,055 --> 01:21:08,285
There you go.

1226
01:21:08,324 --> 01:21:09,518
There you go.

1227
01:21:10,626 --> 01:21:13,026
OK. Now,
no matter what happens...

1228
01:21:13,062 --> 01:21:15,530
keep the ship heading
straight for that portal.

1229
01:21:15,565 --> 01:21:18,432
BEN: Fifty-eight seconds!

1230
01:21:25,308 --> 01:21:27,401
Well, you heard him!

1231
01:21:27,443 --> 01:21:30,776
Get this blasted heap
turned 'round!

1232
01:21:31,848 --> 01:21:33,372
Doctor,
head us back to the portal.

1233
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:34,781
Aye, Captain.

1234
01:21:57,373 --> 01:21:59,136
Go to the right! The right!

1235
01:21:59,175 --> 01:22:02,770
l know, l know!
Will you just let me drive?!

1236
01:22:04,981 --> 01:22:06,846
Twenty-five seconds!

1237
01:22:11,787 --> 01:22:13,220
No! No!

1238
01:22:16,692 --> 01:22:18,489
Come on, lad.

1239
01:22:19,962 --> 01:22:22,795
Seventeen seconds!

1240
01:22:37,847 --> 01:22:39,178
BEN: Seven

1241
01:22:39,215 --> 01:22:42,275
sixfivefour

1242
01:22:42,318 --> 01:22:44,843
three...two...

1243
01:22:52,929 --> 01:22:55,921
Wow! Yeah!

1244
01:22:55,965 --> 01:22:58,957
SLVER: You done it. Jimmy!

1245
01:22:59,001 --> 01:23:02,596
You done it, boy! Ha ha ha!

1246
01:23:02,638 --> 01:23:05,232
Didn't l say the lad
had greatness in him?

1247
01:23:17,486 --> 01:23:21,183
Unorthodox,
but ludicrously effective.

1248
01:23:21,224 --> 01:23:23,089
CAPTAN AMELA: 'd be proud
to recommend you

1249
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:26,822
to the interstellar academy
They could use a man like you

1250
01:23:26,862 --> 01:23:29,797
Just wait until your mother
hears about this!

1251
01:23:29,832 --> 01:23:31,993
Of course, we may downplay
the life-threatening parts.

1252
01:23:32,034 --> 01:23:35,902
Jimmy, that was unforgettable!

1253
01:23:35,938 --> 01:23:37,235
l know you don't like
touching...

1254
01:23:37,273 --> 01:23:40,504
but get ready for a hug,
big guy, 'cause l gotta hug ya!

1255
01:23:40,543 --> 01:23:41,737
Ha ha ha ha!

1256
01:23:43,713 --> 01:23:46,011
Hey, you hugged me back.

1257
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,846
Oh, l promised myself
l wouldn't cry.

1258
01:23:55,091 --> 01:23:58,060
BEN:
Does anyone have a tissue?

1259
01:23:59,502 --> 01:24:02,665
-Morphy, we gotta make tracks.
-l know.

1260
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:04,969
JM: You never quit. do you ?

1261
01:24:05,007 --> 01:24:07,737
Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha!

1262
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:09,836
l was merely
checking to make sure...

1263
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:13,007
our last longboat
was safe and secure.

1264
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:16,618
Mmm.

1265
01:24:16,652 --> 01:24:17,812
Well...

1266
01:24:19,422 --> 01:24:20,582
that should hold it.

1267
01:24:20,623 --> 01:24:24,115
Heh heh heh.
l taught you too well.

1268
01:24:26,162 --> 01:24:29,654
lf you don't mind,
we'd just as soon avoid prison.

1269
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:34,796
Little morphy here,
he's a free spirit.

1270
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:38,568
Being in a cage,
it'd break his heart.

1271
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:53,945
Ohh!

1272
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:59,593
What say you ship out
with us, lad?

1273
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:01,960
You and me,
Hawkins and Silver...

1274
01:25:01,997 --> 01:25:06,764
full of ourselves
and no ties to anyone!

1275
01:25:09,004 --> 01:25:13,338
You know,
when l got on this boat...

1276
01:25:13,376 --> 01:25:17,472
l would've taken you up
on that offer in a second...

1277
01:25:17,513 --> 01:25:21,847
but, uh,
l met this old cyborg...

1278
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:25,342
and he taught me that
l could chart my own course.

That's what l'm gonna do.

Got a bit of grease
in this cyborg eye of mine.

1287

Oh, hey, Morph.

1292
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,618
Aye-aye, Captain.

01:26:46,569 --> 01:26:48,730
Oh, and one more thing.

1294
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:52,538
This is for your dear mother...

1295
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:55,669
to rebuild that inn of hers.

1296
01:26:57,813 --> 01:26:57,880
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scalawag.

1297
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,008
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scalawag.

1298
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,610
Why, Jimbo, lad...

1299
01:27:03,652 --> 01:27:06,519
when have l ever done otherwise?

1300
01:27:39,815 --> 01:27:42,807
Oh!

1301
01:29:12,674 --> 01:29:17,202
# t's good to see the sun
and feel this place #

1302
01:29:17,245 --> 01:29:21,443
# This place  never thought
would feel like home #

1303
01:29:21,483 --> 01:29:23,747
# And  ran forever #

1304
01:29:23,785 --> 01:29:25,980
# Far away #

1305
01:29:26,021 --> 01:29:30,617
# And  always thought
'd end up here alone #

1306
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:34,390
# Somehow
the world has changed #

1307
01:29:34,429 --> 01:29:36,556
# And 've come home #

1308
01:29:36,598 --> 01:29:40,830
# To give you back the things
they took from you #

1309
01:29:40,869 --> 01:29:42,860
# And  feel you now #

1310
01:29:42,904 --> 01:29:45,099
# 'm not alone #

1311
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:51,375
#  always know
where you are #

1312
01:29:51,413 --> 01:29:53,813
# When  see myself #

1313
01:29:53,849 --> 01:30:00,345
#  always know
where you are #

1314
01:30:00,389 --> 01:30:05,326
# Where you are #

1315
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:09,421
# And  found something
that was always there #

1316
01:30:09,464 --> 01:30:14,060
# Sometimes it's got to hut
before you feel #

1317
01:30:14,102 --> 01:30:18,471
# But now 'm strong.
and  won't kneel #

1318
01:30:18,507 --> 01:30:22,500
# Except to thank
who's watching over me #

1319
01:30:22,544 --> 01:30:26,708
# And somehow
feel so strong #

1320
01:30:26,748 --> 01:30:30,684
# And 've begun
to be the one #

1321
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,949
#  never thought 'd be #

1322
01:30:32,988 --> 01:30:35,149
# And  feel you now #

1323
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:37,624
# 'm not alone #

1324
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:43,723
#  always know
where you are #

1325
01:30:43,765 --> 01:30:46,290
# And when  see myself #

1326
01:30:46,334 --> 01:30:52,671
#  always know
where you are #

1327
01:30:52,707 --> 01:30:58,077
# Where you are #

1328
01:30:58,113 --> 01:31:01,640
# Now it's all so clear #

1329
01:31:01,683 --> 01:31:03,981
# And  believe #

1330
01:31:04,019 --> 01:31:07,887
# That everything's been
opened up to me #

1331
01:31:07,923 --> 01:31:09,982
# And  feel you now #

1332
01:31:10,025 --> 01:31:12,323
# 'm not alone #

1333
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,328

1334
01:31:14,362 --> 01:31:20,892

where you are #

1335
01:31:20,936 --> 01:31:23,268
