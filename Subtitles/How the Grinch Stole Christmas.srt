2
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:14,792
...there happened a story
you must see to believe.

3
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:35,062
Way up in the mountains,
in the high range of Pontoos...

4
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:37,940
...lay the small town of Whoville:

5
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,817
The home of the Whos.

6
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,491
Ask any Who, and they'll have this to say:

7
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,954
"There is no place like Whoville
around Christmas Day."

8
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:55,290
Every window was flocked,
every lamppost was dressed...

9
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:59,753
...and the Whoville band marched
in their Christmasy best.

10
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,720
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

11
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:23,569
Arbor Day was fine,
and Easter was pleasant...

12
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:26,905
...and every Saint Fizzin's day,
they ate a Fizz pheasant.

13
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:31,076
But every Who knew,
from their twelve toes to their snout...

14
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,539
...they loved Christmas the most,
without a single Who doubt.

15
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,254
- Farfingle's welcomes you!
- Thank you.

16
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,883
Merry Christmas!
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's!

17
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:49,011
We got a snoozlephone
for your brother Drew...

18
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:53,974
...and a snoozlephone for your brother Stu,
a muncle for your uncle...

19
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,936
...a fant for your aunt
and a fandpa for your cousin Leon.

20
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,272
So, we just need.... Cindy?

21
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,899
Sale on Aisle 3!

22
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,859
- Cindy Lou!
- Merry Christmas.

23
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,570
Hello, Myrna. Merry Christmas, Fred.
Excuse me.

24
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,197
Cindy Lou? Honey?

25
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:10,449
- Dad?
- Yeah?

26
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,493
Doesn't this seem like a bit much?

27
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:14,995
This is what Christmas is all about!

28
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,872
Can't you feel it?

29
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:18,123
Merry Christmas!

30
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,501
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's.
Wait a second!

31
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:21,835
Your change!

32
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:23,921
Another minute closer to Christmas!

33
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:29,969
And, for the next five minutes only,
99 percent off!

34
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,820
Yes, every Who down in Whoville
liked Christmas a lot...

35
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:51,907
...but the Grinch,
who lived just north of Whoville...

36
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,243
...did not.

37
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,790
Get on it, girls.
All the good mistletoe's at the top.

38
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:03,252
- Hey, Drew, I'll race you!
- Not if I race you first.

39
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:06,672
Last one to the top is a stinky old Grinch!

40
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:12,428
You guys, where are we?
I think we should go back.

41
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:14,972
What? You're scared of the Grinch!

42
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:16,765
No!

43
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:19,643
They say he lives up here in a big cave.

44
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:22,479
And only comes down
when he's hungry for the taste of...

45
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,690
- ...Who flesh!
- Drew!

46
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:29,320
You're scared of the Grinch!
You're scared of the Grinch!

47
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:32,614
- Are too!
- Am not!

48
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:37,411
Wait for me!

49
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,883
Go on, touch it. Touch the door.

50
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,676
Do it for me, Stu.

51
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:26,794
Well done, Max!

52
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,464
Serves them right, those Yuletide-loving...

53
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:33,926
...sickly-sweet,
nog-sucking cheer mongers!

54
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:37,554
I really don't like them.

55
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,599
No, I don't.

56
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:44,353
Max!

57
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:48,524
Get my cloak!

58
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:52,695
I've been much too tolerant
of these Whovenile delinquents...

59
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:55,823
...and their innocent, victimless pranks.

60
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,618
So, they want to get to know me, do they?

61
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,539
They want to spend a little quality time
with the Grinch.

62
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:07,376
I guess I could use a little...

63
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,211
...social interaction.

64
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:20,222
Merry Christmas!

65
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:21,932
Yeah, you bet.

66
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,809
Ho, ho, ho, and stuff.

67
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:27,980
Oh, my.

68
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,899
Someone has vandalized that vehicle.

69
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:33,861
You see, Max?
The city is a dangerous place.

70
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,822
The Grinch hated Christmas.
The whole Christmas season.

71
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:38,073
Top of the day. Flatfoot.

72
00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:41,660
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

73
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:43,120
Here's a present for you.

74
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:46,457
Be sure to run real fast with it.
Come on. Double time. Move.

75
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,501
It could be that his head
wasn't screwed on just right.

76
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:53,005
Or it could be, perhaps,
that his shoes were too tight.

77
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,758
But I think that
the most likely reason of all...

78
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:59,845
...may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.

79
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:03,682
Stranger, won't let you go
till you buy a chapeau!

80
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:17,738
Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right?

81
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:19,657
I guess.

82
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:22,034
You guess?

83
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:27,331
It's just, I look around at you and Mom
and everyone getting all kerbobbled.

84
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,209
Doesn't this seem superfluous?

85
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,335
Dad!

86
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:33,629
Dad!

87
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:39,009
- What happened to you?
- It was the Grinch!

88
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,934
- Grinch?
- What do you want? I mean....

89
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,686
"Grinch? Oh, no!"

90
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,898
Did someone just say, "Grinch"?

91
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,693
Hello, Mayor May-Who, sir.

92
00:07:58,946 --> 00:07:59,947
Lou.

93
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:06,620
I don't need to remind you
that this Christmas...

94
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:09,873
...marks the one thousandth Whobilation.

95
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,167
Whoville's most important celebration!

96
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:16,046
And The Book of Who says, very clearly:

97
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,800
"Every size of Who we can measure...

98
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:23,846
"...knows that Whobilation
is a time we must treasure."

99
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,890
Now, Lou, please tell me that your boys...

100
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,268
...were not up on Mount Crumpit...

101
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:33,230
...provoking the one creature
within a billion bilometers of here...

102
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:34,606
...who hates Christmas!

103
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,567
But it was the Grinch!

104
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:40,696
No, sir, the boys didn't see any Grinch.

105
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:42,948
It was, and he came after...

106
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:45,200
I think they were up on the mountain...

107
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:48,537
...playing with matches,
or defacing public property, or....

108
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,332
That's a relief.

109
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,500
All right, you heard the man:

110
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,628
There is no Grinch problem here.

111
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,098
- I need it there by tomorrow.
- Heck of a rush.

112
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,726
Merry Christmas, Mo. Heck of a rush.

113
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:14,772
But, Dad...

114
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:16,732
...I just don't understand something.

115
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,610
Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch?

116
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,237
You kids and the Grinch!

117
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:27,034
You see, Cindy,
the Grinch is a Who, who always....

118
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:30,371
Actually, not a Who. He's more of a....

119
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:34,166
- A what?
- Exactly, honey.

120
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,294
And he's a What
who doesn't like Christmas.

121
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,130
Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie.

122
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:43,050
Not a single Christmas card, in or out.

123
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,718
Ever!

124
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:45,886
But why?

125
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,513
Lou, where's my mail?

126
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,932
Lou! Got the wrong mail here.

127
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:52,267
Lou! I got the wrong mail!

128
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:57,147
- I'll be right there.
- Lou, we got a problem!

129
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,900
All right, we'll straighten this out.

130
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:05,990
It'll take them years to sort this out.

131
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:10,411
This is his and now it's yours,
and this hers and now it's his!

132
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,831
And for the rest of you:

133
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:17,835
Jury duty! Jury duty! Jury duty!

134
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,754
Blackmail. Pink slip.
Chain letter. Eviction notice.

135
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,007
Jury duty!

136
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:31,724
Would you mind helping me
take this to the back room, honey?

137
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:35,227
- Be careful of the sorting machine, right?
- Yeah.

138
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,474
Gesundheit.

139
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:23,692
You're the....

140
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,653
The....

141
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:26,987
The Grinch!

142
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,534
That worked out nicely.

143
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:34,453
Help!

144
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,713
Help me! Somebody!

145
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,465
Max, let's go.

146
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:49,093
Our work here is finished.

147
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:50,469
Help me!

148
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:53,222
Please help!

149
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:55,516
That is not a chew toy!

150
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,142
Stop it, Max!

151
00:11:57,434 --> 00:12:00,437
Get that out of your mouth!
You have no idea where it's been!

152
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:06,485
Help!

153
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:12,950
Bleeding hearts of the world, unite!

154
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,127
There! Give me that!

155
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:26,547
Don't you know you shouldn't
take things that don't belong to you?

156
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,590
What's your problem?
Are you a wild animal?

157
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,678
Let's go.

158
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,097
Thanks for saving me.

159
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:43,022
Saving you?

160
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,108
Is that what you think I was doing?

161
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:50,654
Wrong-o.

162
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,119
I merely noticed that you were
improperly packaged, my dear.

163
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,165
Hold still!

164
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:03,125
Max, pick out a bow.

165
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:05,878
Can I use your finger for a second?

166
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,380
Hello! Hello!

167
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,720
- Cindy?
- Dad!

168
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:17,723
Daddy!

169
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,516
Daddy!

170
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:21,518
What the hey...?

171
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:23,812
Honey.

172
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:26,023
Cindy?

173
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:27,775
Dad! It was amazing!

174
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:31,153
You've been practicing
your Christmas wrapping!

175
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:32,863
I am so proud of you.

176
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:37,242
Now, that's holiday.

177
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,871
Sweet little Cindy didn't know what to do.

178
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,916
In her head, bum-tumbled a conflict or two.

179
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,628
"If the Grinch was so bad,
then why did he save me?

180
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:49,338
"Maybe he wasn't so bad."

181
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,216
Maybe. Just maybe.

182
00:13:57,096 --> 00:13:59,932
No lights on in the house.
Your mom must be shopping.

183
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:02,226
Good, I'm so glad you're home.

184
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:05,312
I can feel it, Lou. This is the year.

185
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:10,985
When everybody asks who has the most
spectacular lights in greater Whoville...

186
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:15,030
...they're gonna cry out,
"Mrs. Betty Lou Who!"

187
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:17,992
Isn't this the chandelier
from the dining room?

188
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:20,327
It's all for the cause, dear.

189
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:23,956
And Cindy?
Could you be Mommy's little helper...

190
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,583
...and unscrew the bulb there
from the refrigerator?

191
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:29,211
- 'Cause somehow I missed that one.
- Go on!

192
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:39,179
Every year Martha May Whovier
has the best lights.

193
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:41,807
Not this year.

194
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,475
This year...

195
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,146
...I'm gonna beat
that prim, perfect little prissy...

196
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:48,439
Betty!

197
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,401
- Hi!
- Martha!

198
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:56,655
My, I've never seen so many
beautiful Christmas lights, Betty Lou!

199
00:14:57,031 --> 00:15:00,451
I'd blow every fuse if I tried to
keep up with you, Martha May!

200
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,287
Isn't this antique darling?

201
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:07,374
It's handcrafted and almost 100 years old.

202
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,960
Jeez. I'm really impressed!

203
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,130
This, however, is new.

204
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:27,811
Betty! Sweetie!

205
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,412
Good night, Betty.

206
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,586
- I got it!
- Honey, I've got it.

207
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,754
Hello?

208
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,925
Is my sub-zero chillibrator running?

209
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:01,428
- I suppose.
- You better go catch it!

210
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,231
That's a good one! That is rich.

211
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,736
Let's go home.

212
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,910
Fleas before beauty. Thank you.

213
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:31,375
Come on, hurry up, Slowpoke.

214
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:48,642
There's got to be a better way!

215
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:13,167
A car would have paid for itself by now!

216
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:17,212
Goody. Another load coming down.

217
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:23,844
What's that stench?

218
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:26,096
It's fantastic!

219
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,267
Max! Grab a bag.

220
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,187
We'll come back for the rest.

221
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:36,315
Of course, when I say "we, " I mean "you."

222
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:40,277
It's amazing
what these Whos just throw away.

223
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:41,445
Oh, well.

224
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,617
One man's toxic sludge
is another man's potpourri.

225
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:49,286
I don't know. It's some kind of soap.

226
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:05,427
"Where are you, Christmas?

227
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:09,431
"Why can't I find you?

228
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:14,979
"Why have you gone away?

229
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,860
"My world is changing

230
00:18:21,986 --> 00:18:25,823
"I'm rearranging

231
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,742
"Does that mean Christmas

232
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:32,830
"changes too?

233
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,509
"Where are you, Christmas?

234
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:48,887
"Do you remember

235
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:55,019
"The girl you used to know?

236
00:18:56,395 --> 00:19:01,358
"You and I were so carefree

237
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,862
"Now nothing's easy

238
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,615
"Did Christmas change

239
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:14,246
"Or just

240
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:19,501
"me?"

241
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,030
Sweet!

242
00:19:58,082 --> 00:20:00,376
"Be it ever so

243
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:01,835
"Heinous

244
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,964
"There's no place like home"

245
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:13,222
First floor, factory rejects.

246
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,892
Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max!

247
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:20,270
But we did our worst.
And that's all that matters.

248
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:24,149
At least I scared the bejeebles
out of that little girl at the post office.

249
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,694
She'll be scarred for life, if we're lucky.

250
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:45,337
Funny she didn't rat on us, though.

251
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:47,673
Must be afraid of reprisals.

252
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:00,894
Yes!

253
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,480
Down a size and a half!

254
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:07,609
And this time, I'll keep it off.

255
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:12,406
Get the stick, Max. Get the stick!

256
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:18,162
There's no stick!

257
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:19,747
I'm smarter.

258
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:28,213
Any calls?

259
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:31,800
You have no messages.

260
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:35,763
Odd. Better check the outgoing.

261
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:39,516
If you utter so much as one syllable...

262
00:21:39,642 --> 00:21:43,479
...I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish!

263
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:46,565
If you'd like to fax me, press the star key.

264
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:50,444
Oh, well.

265
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:57,660
That's more like it.

266
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:19,640
Excellent year.

267
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:22,309
I'll tell you, Max...

268
00:22:22,518 --> 00:22:24,895
...I don't know why I ever leave this place.

269
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,857
I've got all the company I need right here.

270
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:31,902
Hello!

271
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,487
Hello!

272
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:35,656
How are you?

273
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:37,032
How are you?

274
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,076
I asked you first.

275
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,411
I asked you first.

276
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:44,915
That's really mature,
saying exactly what I say!

277
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,627
Mature...exactly...what I say....

278
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:51,255
I'm an idiot!

279
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,716
You're an idiot!

280
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:58,137
All right, fine.

281
00:22:58,262 --> 00:23:01,765
I'm not talking to you anymore.
In fact, I'm going to whisper.

282
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:06,228
So that by the time my voice reverberates
off the walls and gets back to me...

283
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:09,273
...I won't be able to hear it!

284
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:12,693
You're an idiot!

285
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:26,915
Am I just eating because I'm bored?

286
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:38,552
Who could that be?

287
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,599
Hello, little girl.
Are you here to read to us?

288
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:44,808
No.

289
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:48,312
I hear you know some things
about the Grinch.

290
00:23:48,437 --> 00:23:52,191
Cindy Lou had some questions
in her curious heart.

291
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:56,362
Why did the Grinch hate Christmas?
Where did it all start?

292
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:59,448
With her dad's blabbacorder
she wouldn't give an inch.

293
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:04,119
In your own words, please tell me
everything you know about the Grinch.

294
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,080
Where did he come from?

295
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:10,459
He came the way all Who babies come.

296
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:13,921
On calm nights...

297
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:17,966
...baby Who girls
and tiny Who fellas...

298
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:23,180
...drift from the sky
in their own pumbersellas.

299
00:24:30,854 --> 00:24:34,024
Hey, honey, our baby is here!

300
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:38,070
He looks just like your boss.

301
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:42,241
So that's how it works.

302
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:47,871
It was Christmas Eve,
and a strange wind blew that night.

303
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:17,443
We were having
our annual holiday get-together.

304
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:44,970
It was morning before anybody realized
that he was out there!

305
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:46,138
The poor dear!

306
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:48,182
But, you know what?

307
00:25:48,265 --> 00:25:50,309
We knew right away that he was special.

308
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:58,400
Do you want a Christmas cookie?

309
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:01,362
Yes, which Christmas cookie
would you like?

310
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:02,488
Santa.

311
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:05,449
His first words!

312
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:07,826
Yes, that is a Santa plate.

313
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:10,579
Do you want to hold this Santa plate?

314
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:19,755
Santa, bye-bye!

315
00:26:24,593 --> 00:26:26,637
He was a wonderful...

316
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:28,764
...whatever he was.

317
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:32,643
And we raised him
like any other Who child:

318
00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:34,728
With a deep love of Christmas.

319
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:41,443
Don't forget, tomorrow
is our big Christmas gift exchange.

320
00:26:41,944 --> 00:26:45,948
Everyone bring a special gift
for a special someone.

321
00:26:46,865 --> 00:26:48,033
The...

322
00:26:48,158 --> 00:26:49,743
...Grinch....

323
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:53,580
He had no sense of color coordination.

324
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:58,043
Although I hardly remember him.
I didn't have time to socialize.

325
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:00,796
I was far too busy with my...

326
00:27:01,505 --> 00:27:02,589
...studies.

327
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,801
Now, class, is everyone almost finished?

328
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:09,930
And if the truth be told, he....

329
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:11,348
He liked Martha.

330
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:15,144
Martha was my girlfriend.

331
00:27:18,022 --> 00:27:22,192
I don't like discussing this Grinch
so very close to Christmas, but...

332
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:25,154
...maybe if you hear the truth,
you'll understand why...

333
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:27,031
Put your back into it!

334
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:30,701
I tried to take him under my wing.

335
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:35,372
You don't have a chance with her.
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

336
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:41,545
He had hair. Not pleasant.

337
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:44,798
He shed.

338
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:46,133
Not right.

339
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:52,014
You know, Christmas
is my favorite time of year.

340
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:54,350
I just love the colors.

341
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,268
The red...

342
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:58,312
...and the green.

343
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:04,026
Did I have a crush on the Grinch?

344
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,320
Of course not.

345
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,238
I didn't ask you that.

346
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:11,909
Right.

347
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:15,663
For some reason,
when he came home that day...

348
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:18,957
...he really got into the Christmas spirit
for the first time.

349
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,001
Perfect!

350
00:28:24,546 --> 00:28:25,631
Whoopsie!

351
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:34,640
What a lovely family heirloom!

352
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:48,612
The fires of love!

353
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:53,701
This will be perfect on the top of her tree.

354
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:56,704
Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas!

355
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:06,380
I want you all to look your best tomorrow.

356
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:09,258
You don't have a chance with her.

357
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:12,177
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

358
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,611
Has everyone given their gifts?

359
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:32,531
- I haven't.
- What?

360
00:29:39,872 --> 00:29:41,832
Merry Christmas, Martha May.

361
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,586
Why do you have a bag on your head?

362
00:29:46,337 --> 00:29:50,174
Probably because
he's embarrassed by that hideodorous gift.

363
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:53,302
Mr. Grinch...

364
00:29:53,636 --> 00:29:56,013
...please take the bag off.

365
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:58,557
Yes, you.

366
00:29:58,682 --> 00:29:59,850
Take it off.

367
00:30:04,897 --> 00:30:06,690
Put the book down.

368
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:12,738
And your foot.

369
00:30:15,741 --> 00:30:17,368
Look at that hack job!

370
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,839
Stupid present!

371
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:33,050
Stupid tree!

372
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:36,303
I hate Christmas!

373
00:30:36,553 --> 00:30:38,681
- The anger.
- The fury!

374
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:40,891
The muscles!

375
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:57,157
It was a horrible day
when they were so cruel to him.

376
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:58,909
And...

377
00:31:00,536 --> 00:31:02,162
...I could hardly bear it.

378
00:31:18,512 --> 00:31:21,348
I hate Christmas! I hate it!

379
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:25,311
And that was the last time
we ever saw him.

380
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:30,274
The very last time.

381
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,287
So, whatever the reason,
his heart or his shoes...

382
00:32:25,704 --> 00:32:27,831
...he stood outside his cave...

383
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,292
...hating the Whos.

384
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:32,628
Alphabetically.

385
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:37,174
Aardvarkian Abakenezer Who...

386
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:38,550
...l...

387
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:42,262
...hate you!

388
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:49,061
Aaron B. Benson Who, I hate you.

389
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,647
Hate, hate, hate.
Hate, hate, hate.

390
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,190
Double hate.

391
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:57,236
Loathe entirely!

392
00:33:04,118 --> 00:33:05,911
Nutcrackers?

393
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:09,581
It's their Whobilation.

394
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:12,209
He snarled with a sneer.

395
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:16,797
Tomorrow is Christmas!
It's practically here.

396
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:19,591
Max!

397
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:22,636
Fetch me my sedative.

398
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:26,890
Now to take care of those pesky memories.

399
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:32,354
"Whobilation, plentiful
with candy canes and pies

400
00:33:32,438 --> 00:33:35,524
"I can't wait to get there
to eat some google fries

401
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:37,234
"Whobilation, Whobilation"

402
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:38,652
- Dad?
- Yeah.

403
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:42,823
I've been thinking about the Whobilation
and I may do something drastic.

404
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:45,034
That's fine, dear. Ask your mother.

405
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:47,661
- Where did she go?
- Honey!

406
00:33:47,745 --> 00:33:49,371
Honey! Hi!

407
00:33:50,456 --> 00:33:54,293
Look, I just found the cutest light
for my Christmas display.

408
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:57,880
Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Come on.

409
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:19,109
And now, the nominations...

410
00:34:19,193 --> 00:34:21,945
...for that Who among us
who best typifies...

411
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:25,532
...the qualities of Whodom and Whodery...

412
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:29,912
...the Whoville holiday cheer-meister!

413
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:41,131
Do I hear a nomination?

414
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:42,549
I nominate the Grinch!

415
00:34:44,635 --> 00:34:47,513
- The Grinch?
- The Grinch?

416
00:34:49,682 --> 00:34:51,642
My, my, my.

417
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:55,062
What an altruistic daughter
you have there, Lou!

418
00:34:56,188 --> 00:34:57,773
Thank you.

419
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:00,526
Cindy?

420
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:05,614
Let me quote a verse...

421
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:08,200
...from The Book of Who.

422
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,035
Thank you.

423
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,499
"The term 'Grinchy' shall apply
when Christmas spirit is in short supply."

424
00:35:15,582 --> 00:35:18,919
Now, I ask you: Does that sound
like our holiday cheer-meister?

425
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:23,799
True, Mr. May-Who.
But The Book of Who says this too:

426
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:26,427
"No matter how different
a Who may appear...

427
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,430
"...he will always be welcomed
with holiday cheer."

428
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:35,728
Yes, the book also says, the....

429
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:37,187
"The award...

430
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:40,107
"...cannot go to the Grinch, because...

431
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,028
"...sometimes things
get the lead-pipe cinch."

432
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:46,530
You made that up! It doesn't say that.

433
00:35:47,114 --> 00:35:48,824
No, it does.

434
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,160
What page?

435
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,499
Lost my place, but it's....

436
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,209
It's in here!

437
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:01,253
But the book does say:

438
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:05,090
"The cheer-meister is the one
who deserves a back slap or a toast.

439
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:08,677
"And it goes to the soul at Christmas
who needs it most."

440
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:11,388
And I believe that soul is the Grinch.

441
00:36:12,473 --> 00:36:16,852
And if you're the Whos I hope you are,
you will too.

442
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:19,563
She's right!

443
00:36:24,818 --> 00:36:25,903
Fine.

444
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:29,698
You people want to waste
a perfectly good nomination...

445
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:31,533
...why, it's up to you.

446
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:34,370
But I am telling you...

447
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:37,790
...the Grinch will never come down.

448
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:40,834
And when he doesn't,
the Mayor will wear the crown.

449
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,003
Well, more or less.

450
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:46,757

00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,712
Blast this Christmas music.

462
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:28,507
It's joyful and triumphant.

463
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,427
Must drown them out!

464
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:42,855
Not working!

The whipper-winds whipped
high above the Who town.

466
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:51,822
A trip or a slip
you'd slide all the way down.

467
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:55,784
But this girl had a mission.
She knew what to do.

468
00:37:55,868 --> 00:38:00,247
She'd invite the Grinch herself,
that brave Cindy Lou.

469
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,800
Play, monkey! Play!

470
00:38:24,146 --> 00:38:25,939
Howdy?

471
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:30,819
Mr. Grinch?

472
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:35,741
Mr. Grinch!

473
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:41,664
Hello?

474
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:09,358
Excuse me.

475
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,750
Hello...

476
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,711
...little girl.

477
00:39:29,211 --> 00:39:31,755
How dare you enter...

478
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:34,508
...the Grinch's lair?

479
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:37,594
The impudence! The audacity!

480
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:40,556
The unmitigated gall!

481
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,683
You called down the thunder...

482
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:46,228
...now, get ready for the boom!

483
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:51,025
Gaze into the face of fear!

484
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:54,945
Mr. Grinch...

485
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,781
...my name is Cindy Lou Who.

486
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:58,866
You see?

487
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:03,287
Even now the terror
is welling up inside you.

488
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:06,123
I'm not scared.

489
00:40:06,332 --> 00:40:10,461
Denial is to be expected
in the face of pure evil.

490
00:40:12,629 --> 00:40:14,214
I don't think so.

491
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:16,508
Doubt?

492
00:40:16,592 --> 00:40:20,429
Another unmistakable sign
of the heebie-jeebies!

493
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:24,642
Now you're doomed!

494
00:40:32,274 --> 00:40:34,234
Run for your life...

495
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,738
...before I kill again!

496
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,784
I'm a psycho!

497
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:47,164
Danger! Danger!

498
00:40:56,382 --> 00:40:58,509
Maybe you need a time-out.

499
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:05,391
Kids today.

500
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:08,435
So desensitized by movies and television.

501
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:10,562
What do you want?

502
00:41:11,855 --> 00:41:14,858
Mr. Grinch, I came to invite you...

503
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:18,070
...to be holiday cheer-meister.

504
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:23,617
- "Holiday Whobie-what-y"?
- Cheer-meister.

505
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:26,996
"Cheer-meister. Celebrate with friends."

506
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,835
That's a good one.

507
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:37,631
I know you hate Christmas,
but what if it's all just a misunderstanding?

508
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:41,468
- Don't care.
- I myself am having some Yuletide doubts.

509
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:45,639
But maybe if you reunite
with the Whos and be a part of Christmas...

510
00:41:45,723 --> 00:41:48,726
"Maybe if you reunite with the Whos
and be a part of Christmas."

511
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:49,810
Grow up!

512
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:51,979
Then maybe it'll be all right for me, too!

513
00:41:52,062 --> 00:41:53,564
I'm sorry, your session is over.

514
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:56,817
Please make another appointment
with the receptionist on the way out.

515
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,278
Please, please.
You have to accept the award.

516
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:06,535
Award?

517
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:12,041
You never mentioned an award!

518
00:42:12,624 --> 00:42:14,668
Yeah, with a trophy and everything.

519
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:16,795
- And I won?
- You won!

520
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,507
- That means there were losers.
- I guess.

521
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:24,887
- So, if you come...
- A town full of losers!

522
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:26,889
I like it.

523
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:30,267
Was anyone emotionally shattered?

524
00:42:31,226 --> 00:42:34,480
Come on, a minute ago
I couldn't shut you up! Details, details!

525
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:36,982
The Mayor wasn't happy.

526
00:42:39,276 --> 00:42:40,527
Oh, no.

527
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:42,905
Martha May will be there.

528
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:46,200
She will?

529
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:49,078
And she'll see me.

530
00:42:49,662 --> 00:42:50,746
A winner.

531
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:56,043
She'll be on me like fleegle flies
on a flat-faced floogle horse.

532
00:42:56,126 --> 00:43:00,673
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Martha, baby,
but the G train has left the station.

533
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:03,008
So, will you come?

534
00:43:03,676 --> 00:43:05,094
All right.

535
00:43:05,928 --> 00:43:08,722
I don't know if it's
that adorable twinkle in your eye...

536
00:43:08,806 --> 00:43:10,391
...or that nonconformist streak...

537
00:43:10,516 --> 00:43:14,103
...that reminds me of a younger,
less hairy me.

538
00:43:14,436 --> 00:43:16,313
But you've convinced me.

539
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:21,485
Who knows? This Whobilation
could change my entire outlook on life!

540
00:43:22,152 --> 00:43:23,862
- Really?
- No.

541
00:43:57,896 --> 00:43:59,773
There you are, honey.

542
00:44:00,149 --> 00:44:02,359
You can make snow angels later.

543
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:04,862
We can't be late for the Whobilation!

544
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:09,867
The nerve of those Whos.

545
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,370
Inviting me down there
on such short notice.

546
00:44:13,495 --> 00:44:17,082
Even if I wanted to go,
my schedule wouldn't allow it.

547
00:44:19,543 --> 00:44:22,338
"4:00, wallow in self-pity.

548
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:25,341
"4:30, stare into the abyss.

549
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:28,218
"5:00, solve world hunger...

550
00:44:28,344 --> 00:44:30,387
"...tell no one.

551
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:32,348
"5:30, jazzercise.

552
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:35,476
"6:30, dinner with me."
I can't cancel that again.

553
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:39,229
"7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing."

554
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,814
I'm booked.

555
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:44,193
If I bumped the loathing to 9:00,
I'd have time to lay in bed...

556
00:44:44,276 --> 00:44:48,030
...stare at the ceiling
and slip slowly into madness.

557
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:50,532
But what would I wear?

558
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:13,180
It's not a dress, it's a kilt!

559
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,850
Sicko!

560
00:45:17,935 --> 00:45:18,936
Stupid.

561
00:45:19,103 --> 00:45:20,104
Ugly.

562
00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:21,689
Out of date.

563
00:45:23,273 --> 00:45:24,817
This is ridiculous.

564
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,404
If I can't find something nice to wear,
I'm not going!

565
00:45:46,588 --> 00:45:48,465
That's it, I'm not going.

566
00:46:00,686 --> 00:46:05,065
It's time for our Holiday Cheer-meister
of the Year Award!

567
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:14,783
Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!

568
00:46:17,411 --> 00:46:18,912
He isn't here.

569
00:46:19,538 --> 00:46:20,706
What?

570
00:46:21,582 --> 00:46:23,292
He didn't show?

571
00:46:25,002 --> 00:46:26,879
Who could have predicted this?

572
00:46:28,172 --> 00:46:32,259
All right. I'll swing by for a minute,
allow them to envy me...

573
00:46:32,343 --> 00:46:35,512
...grab a handful of popcorn shrimp,
and blow out of there.

574
00:46:36,013 --> 00:46:39,600
But what if it's a cruel prank?
What if it's a cash bar?

575
00:46:40,184 --> 00:46:41,977
How dare they?

576
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,104
All right, I'll go.

577
00:46:44,188 --> 00:46:45,689
But I'll be fashionably late.

578
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:48,067
No. Yes. No. Yes. No!

579
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:49,234
Yes!

580
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,446
Definitely not!

581
00:46:52,905 --> 00:46:55,282
All right. I've made my decision!

582
00:46:55,824 --> 00:46:58,202
I'm going, and that's that.

583
00:46:59,745 --> 00:47:01,163
Had my fingers crossed.

584
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,878
Maybe I should flip a coin!

585
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:18,597
I guess the award goes to...

586
00:47:18,806 --> 00:47:20,140
...the runner-up.

587
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:25,980
That's right. A man for whom
Christmas comes not once a year...

588
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:28,565
...but every minute of every day.

589
00:47:29,024 --> 00:47:31,485
A handsome, noble man.

590
00:47:32,194 --> 00:47:34,321
A man who
has had his tonsils removed twice!

591
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:37,324
That's an interesting story.

592
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:39,618
You see, what happened was...

593
00:47:54,591 --> 00:47:55,843
Hello, Martha.

594
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:57,052
He made it!

595
00:47:57,428 --> 00:47:58,512
- Cindy.
- Honey!

596
00:48:22,578 --> 00:48:23,579
Look...

597
00:48:26,248 --> 00:48:28,042
Hot crowd. Hot crowd.

598
00:48:30,085 --> 00:48:32,129
I believe I'm here to...

599
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,009
...accept an award of some kind.

600
00:48:39,345 --> 00:48:43,098
And the child mentioned a check.

601
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,143
- No, I didn't.
- All right, then, give me the award.

602
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:48,228
Come on, while I'm young!

603
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:52,775
Don't you worry, Mr. Holiday Cheer-meister,
you'll get your award.

604
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,945
But first, a little family reunion.

605
00:48:57,988 --> 00:49:01,158
They nursed you. They clothed you.

606
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:02,785
Here they are...

607
00:49:02,868 --> 00:49:05,704
...your old biddies!

608
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:09,792
Are you two still living?

609
00:49:10,501 --> 00:49:11,877
We missed you!

610
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:15,172
Rose. The sweater. The sweater, Rose.

611
00:49:15,547 --> 00:49:18,258
Sweater? What are you talkin' about?
No, I can't!

612
00:49:18,342 --> 00:49:19,969
I can't do that!

613
00:49:22,554 --> 00:49:24,348
Don't touch me there!

614
00:49:32,189 --> 00:49:34,400
Put him in the Chair of Cheer!

615
00:49:34,483 --> 00:49:35,901
Chair of Cheer?

616
00:49:35,985 --> 00:49:37,778
What's the Chair of Cheer?

617
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:40,114
You didn't tell me about the Chair of Cheer.

618
00:49:40,197 --> 00:49:42,574
Please, Mr. Grinch.

619
00:49:43,784 --> 00:49:45,369
No. I can't do it, honestly.

620
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:47,246
I'm not ready. It's too much, too soon!

621
00:49:47,538 --> 00:49:49,415
It's that time of year.

622
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:51,792
The Cheer-meister's ride
in the Chair of Cheer!

623
00:49:52,793 --> 00:49:54,920
Put me down! I mean it!

624
00:49:55,004 --> 00:49:56,380
I've got a lawyer.

625
00:49:56,463 --> 00:49:58,424
There'll be hell to pay!

626
00:49:59,842 --> 00:50:02,928
First, you'll put
your taste buds to the test...

627
00:50:03,012 --> 00:50:07,391
...as you judge the Who pudding cook-off!

628
00:50:08,017 --> 00:50:09,977
- Mine first.
- I really don't know...

629
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,770
No, mine's the best!

630
00:50:12,187 --> 00:50:13,814
You'll enjoy this!

631
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:16,859
This is not pudding.

632
00:50:17,776 --> 00:50:19,028
What is it?

633
00:50:20,988 --> 00:50:23,365
This is mine. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

634
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:25,492
Christmas conga!

635
00:50:25,701 --> 00:50:28,620
Look at the time.
I really should be getting back.

636
00:50:28,704 --> 00:50:30,581
All right!

637
00:50:35,377 --> 00:50:37,004
Fruitcake, tra-la-la!

638
00:50:38,172 --> 00:50:39,340
No.

639
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:46,639
Fudge Judge.

640
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:50,601
Made it myself.

641
00:50:50,976 --> 00:50:52,561
Yeah? Mine are homemade too.

642
00:50:53,145 --> 00:50:54,313
Okay.

643
00:50:55,022 --> 00:50:56,815
Put it in. Bring it on!

644
00:50:57,524 --> 00:50:59,401
Is that all you got?

645
00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:01,362
Is that all you got? Come on.

646
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:08,869
Out of the way, slow-mo!

647
00:51:10,537 --> 00:51:11,622
Excuse me.

648
00:51:24,885 --> 00:51:27,262
He's number one in the sack race run!

649
00:51:27,346 --> 00:51:30,516
Number one! I'm number one!

650
00:51:30,683 --> 00:51:32,726
I'm number one!

651
00:51:33,268 --> 00:51:36,438
No child can beat the Grinch!

652
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:43,362
I beat you.

653
00:51:51,704 --> 00:51:53,038
He won!

654
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:58,127
And now it's time
for the moment we've all been waiting for.

655
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,754
Yes! My award.

656
00:52:00,963 --> 00:52:02,923
- Write the check.
- There's no check.

657
00:52:03,007 --> 00:52:06,510
Are you sure? Because I thought
I heard someone mention a check.

658
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:09,346
I said, there's no check.
And now it's time...

659
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,724
...for Present Pass-it-on!

660
00:52:12,182 --> 00:52:15,269
As always, we start with our Cheer-meister.

661
00:52:23,902 --> 00:52:26,447
The gift of a Christmas shave.

662
00:52:40,794 --> 00:52:42,755
Look at that hack job!

663
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,601
Yes, yes, yes. Good times!

664
00:52:57,102 --> 00:52:58,187
Good times.

665
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:03,359
And now, I have a little something
for the love of my life.

666
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,111
Martha May...

667
00:53:08,447 --> 00:53:11,450
...please become Mrs. Augustus May-Who.

668
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:21,168
Augustus....

669
00:53:22,086 --> 00:53:23,879
If you agree to be my wife...

670
00:53:24,088 --> 00:53:28,384
...along with a lifetime supply of happiness,
you'll also receive this:

671
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,681
It's a new car!

672
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,143
Generously provided
by the taxpayers of Whoville!

673
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,855
What do you say, Martha?

674
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:45,609
You got 20 seconds on the clock.

675
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:49,905
I....

676
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:55,869
These gifts are quite dazzling.

677
00:54:06,213 --> 00:54:08,590
Of course they are.

678
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:11,468
That's what it's all about, isn't it?

679
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:15,139
That's what it's always been about!

680
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:17,433
Gifts!

681
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:19,143
Gifts.

682
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,687
Gifts, gifts, gifts.

683
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:24,815
You want to know what happens
to your gifts?

684
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:27,776
They all come to me. In your garbage.

685
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:29,570
You see what I'm saying?

686
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:31,697
In your garbage!

687
00:54:32,781 --> 00:54:37,578
I could hang myself with all the bad
Christmas neckties I found at the dump!

688
00:54:38,871 --> 00:54:40,289
And the avarice.

689
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:45,044
The avarice never ends!

690
00:54:45,169 --> 00:54:47,046
"I want golf clubs." "I want diamonds."

691
00:54:47,171 --> 00:54:51,091
"I want a pony, so I can ride it twice,
get bored, and sell it to make glue."

692
00:54:51,842 --> 00:54:56,889
Look, I don't want to make waves,
but this whole Christmas season is...

693
00:54:57,097 --> 00:54:59,475
...stupid, stupid, stupid!

694
00:55:00,893 --> 00:55:02,686
There is, however...

695
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,315
...one teeny-tiny...

696
00:55:06,857 --> 00:55:08,484
...Christmas tradition...

697
00:55:09,026 --> 00:55:10,527
...I find...

698
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:13,947
...quite meaningful.

699
00:55:19,286 --> 00:55:20,663
Mistletoe.

700
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,874
Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville!

701
00:55:32,466 --> 00:55:35,219
Somebody's fabulous!

702
00:55:38,889 --> 00:55:40,432
All right, your turn! Go on!

703
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:49,858
- Let's go!
- No!

704
00:55:50,484 --> 00:55:51,986
Excuse me, old-timer.

705
00:55:52,903 --> 00:55:54,697
Mind if I wet my whistle?

706
00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:01,245
That's my good stuff!

707
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:11,880
Burn, baby! Burn!

708
00:56:25,185 --> 00:56:27,646
The Whomanity!

709
00:56:28,147 --> 00:56:29,481
- Let's go! Come on!
- No, wait!

710
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:32,192
- Do something.
- Right!

711
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:41,744
Calling all units. Calling all units.

712
00:56:45,914 --> 00:56:47,291
Taxi!

713
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:52,004
It's because I'm green, isn't it?

714
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,344
Halt!

715
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:02,765
Evening, folks. Mind if I ride along?

716
00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:05,225
You might want to scooch over.

717
00:57:07,311 --> 00:57:08,896
You did the right thing.

718
00:57:17,279 --> 00:57:18,906
Out of the way!

719
00:57:28,707 --> 00:57:31,085
That's gonna hurt in the morning.

720
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:57,236
It's gonna blow!

721
00:58:14,837 --> 00:58:16,338
You fellas all right?

722
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:18,215
How about a nice hat?

723
00:58:18,674 --> 00:58:19,842
Lou?

724
00:58:28,934 --> 00:58:30,269
I'm hurt, Lou.

725
00:58:31,603 --> 00:58:33,897
I'm hurt, and I don't hurt easily.

726
00:58:34,023 --> 00:58:36,775
But you and your family....

727
00:58:37,776 --> 00:58:39,361
I'm so...

728
00:58:39,445 --> 00:58:41,030
...disappointed.

729
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:45,159
Can we just get back to Christmas...

730
00:58:45,576 --> 00:58:47,953
...the way it should be?

731
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,372
Grinch-less?

732
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:53,208
Merry Christmas!

733
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:56,545
Merry Christmas!

734
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:04,637
I just wanted everybody
to be together for Christmas.

735
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:09,475
I quite enjoyed that.

736
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,560
I hope I get another invite soon.

737
00:59:16,982 --> 00:59:18,359
Come on, come on!

738
00:59:18,442 --> 00:59:20,569
Good thing we have a spare.

739
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,741
Suffering snorkelblatz!

740
00:59:26,158 --> 00:59:28,285
They're relentless!

741
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:37,586
Only four hours till Christmas!

742
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,217
Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow
all the Who girls and boys...

743
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:46,679
...would wake bright and early
and rush for their toys.

744
00:59:46,804 --> 00:59:49,723
And then, the noise!

745
00:59:49,932 --> 00:59:53,769
The noise, noise, noise!

746
00:59:54,353 --> 00:59:56,480
They'll bang on tong-tinglers.

747
00:59:56,605 --> 00:59:58,732
They'll blow their floo-flounders.

748
00:59:58,941 --> 01:00:02,695
They'll crash on jang-jinglers
and bounce on boing-bounders!

749
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:07,241
Then Whos young and old
would sit down to a feast.

750
01:00:07,324 --> 01:00:09,952
And they'll feast and they'll feast.

751
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:13,706
And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast!

752
01:00:13,956 --> 01:00:15,833
They'll eat their Who pudding.

753
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:19,795
And rare Who roast beast!

754
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:24,466
But there's something
I just cannot stand in the least.

755
01:00:24,842 --> 01:00:26,010
Oh, no.

756
01:00:26,385 --> 01:00:29,972
I'm speaking in rhyme!

757
01:00:35,227 --> 01:00:38,314
Blast you Whos!

758
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:47,072
And the more the Grinch thought
of what Christmas would bring...

759
01:00:47,406 --> 01:00:49,616
...the more the Grinch thought:

760
01:00:49,742 --> 01:00:52,661
I must stop this whole thing.

761
01:00:54,204 --> 01:00:58,208
Why, for year after year
I've put up with it now!

762
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:01,795
I must stop this Christmas from coming!
But how?

763
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:05,299
I mean, in what way?

764
01:01:08,552 --> 01:01:12,681
"Christmas is goin' to the dogs

765
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:17,728
"We're scoffing down
the turkey and the grog

766
01:01:20,522 --> 01:01:22,983
"Things are looking very good, it's true"

767
01:01:24,526 --> 01:01:27,863
Are you having a holly, jolly...

768
01:01:28,739 --> 01:01:30,532
...Christmas?

769
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:33,452
Wrong-o!

770
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,430
If you're not going to help me...

771
01:01:53,764 --> 01:01:55,975
...then you might as well....

772
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,227
Then he got an idea.

773
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:01,188
An awful idea.

774
01:02:02,064 --> 01:02:04,274
The Grinch got a wonderful...

775
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:06,694
...awful idea.

776
01:02:07,027 --> 01:02:11,407
I know just what to do.

777
01:02:19,915 --> 01:02:22,459
The Grinch laughed in his throat.

778
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,754
And he made a quick
Santy Claus hat and a coat.

779
01:02:29,008 --> 01:02:31,677
And he chuckled and clucked...

780
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:34,305
...at this great Grinchy trick.

781
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:38,309
With this coat and this hat,
I'll look just like Saint Nick.

782
01:02:40,144 --> 01:02:43,147
â™ª You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch â™ª

783
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:48,652
â™ª You really are a heel â™ª

784
01:02:49,236 --> 01:02:53,365
â™ª You're as cuddly as a cactus
and as charming as an eel â™ª

785
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:55,993
â™ª Mr. Grinch â™ª

786
01:02:56,702 --> 01:02:58,495
â™ª You're a bad banana â™ª

787
01:02:58,954 --> 01:03:02,374
â™ª With a greasy black peel â™ª

788
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,133
â™ª Just face the music, you're a monster â™ª

789
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,011
â™ª Mr. Grinch, yes, you are â™ª

790
01:03:14,511 --> 01:03:18,599
â™ª Your heart's an empty hole â™ª

791
01:03:18,974 --> 01:03:22,728
â™ª Your brain is full of spiders
You got garlic in your soul â™ª

792
01:03:22,853 --> 01:03:25,230
â™ª Mr. Grinch â™ª

793
01:03:26,398 --> 01:03:28,692
â™ª I wouldn't touch you with a â™ª

794
01:03:29,777 --> 01:03:33,280
â™ª thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole â™ª

795
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,170
I asked for three-quarters, not five-eighths.

796
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:49,838
Stay focused!

797
01:03:56,136 --> 01:03:59,473
â™ª You know, if you asked
the who's who of Whoville â™ª

798
01:04:00,933 --> 01:04:04,436
â™ª No one would deny it â™ª

799
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:26,792
Air bag is a little slow.

800
01:04:29,211 --> 01:04:31,755
But that's what these tests are for!

801
01:04:32,673 --> 01:04:34,550
â™ª You're a vile one â™ª

802
01:04:35,134 --> 01:04:36,552
â™ª Mr. Grinch â™ª

803
01:04:37,678 --> 01:04:41,598
â™ª You have termites in your smile â™ª

804
01:04:42,224 --> 01:04:46,687
â™ª You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile â™ª

805
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:48,981
â™ª Mr. Grinch â™ª

806
01:04:50,274 --> 01:04:52,568
â™ª Given the choice between you â™ª

807
01:04:52,651 --> 01:04:55,988
â™ª I'd take the seasick crocodile â™ª

808
01:05:18,886 --> 01:05:22,473
Fat boy should be finishing up
anytime now.

809
01:05:23,474 --> 01:05:25,351
Talk about a recluse.

810
01:05:25,434 --> 01:05:29,813
He only comes out once a year,
and he never catches any flak for it!

811
01:05:31,148 --> 01:05:33,901
Probably lives up there to avoid the taxes.

812
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:38,489
Merry Christmas!

813
01:05:40,324 --> 01:05:41,575
Oopsie.

814
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,037
Forgot about the reindeer.

815
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:48,540
Did that stop the old Grinch?

816
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,834
No.

817
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:53,003
The Grinch simply said:

818
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,964
If I can't find a reindeer...

819
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:00,052
...I'll make one instead.

820
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:08,102
Oh, Max!

821
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:13,357
So he called his dog Max...

822
01:06:14,108 --> 01:06:15,985
...and he took some red thread...

823
01:06:16,193 --> 01:06:19,613
...and tied a big horn on top of his head.

824
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:24,284
All right.

825
01:06:24,827 --> 01:06:27,705
You're a reindeer. Here's your motivation.

826
01:06:27,997 --> 01:06:30,958
You're Rudolph, a freak with a red nose,
nobody likes you.

827
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:34,003
Then one day,
Santa picks you and you save Christmas.

828
01:06:36,422 --> 01:06:38,799
No, forget that part. We'll improvise.

829
01:06:38,924 --> 01:06:41,385
Just keep it kind of loosey-goosey.

830
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:43,679
You hate Christmas! You're gonna steal it!

831
01:06:44,096 --> 01:06:47,599
Saving Christmas was a lousy ending.
Way too commercial.

832
01:06:49,143 --> 01:06:50,602
Action!

833
01:06:53,272 --> 01:06:54,440
Brilliant!

834
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:56,817
You reject your own nose...

835
01:06:56,942 --> 01:06:59,611
...because it represents the
glitter of commercialism!

836
01:06:59,695 --> 01:07:01,488
Why didn't I think of that?

837
01:07:01,572 --> 01:07:03,782
Cut, print, check the gate. Moving on.

838
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:15,085
That...

839
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:16,628
...feels...

840
01:07:16,712 --> 01:07:18,839
...good.

841
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:32,978
Here goes nothin', hot dog!

842
01:07:38,817 --> 01:07:39,902
Wow!

843
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:56,418
This is nuts!

844
01:07:58,462 --> 01:08:00,506
On, Crasher! On, Thrasher!

845
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:02,966
On, Vomit and Blitzkrieg!

846
01:08:11,809 --> 01:08:13,268
We're gonna die!

847
01:08:13,394 --> 01:08:15,104
We're gonna die!

848
01:08:15,479 --> 01:08:18,899
I'm going to throw up,
and then I'm gonna die!

849
01:08:21,318 --> 01:08:24,405
Mommy, tell it to stop!

850
01:08:43,382 --> 01:08:46,135
Almost lost my cool there.

851
01:08:51,348 --> 01:08:55,561
All their windows were dark.
Quiet snow filled the air.

852
01:08:55,769 --> 01:09:00,024
All the Whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care...

853
01:09:00,149 --> 01:09:02,818
...when he came to the first
little house on the square.

854
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:04,945
Welcome to Whoville, Max.

855
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:13,954
Betty?

856
01:09:14,246 --> 01:09:15,497
- Betty?
- What?

857
01:09:15,581 --> 01:09:17,541
Did you hear something?

858
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:20,836
It's Santa!

859
01:09:20,919 --> 01:09:22,880
Go right back to sleep.

860
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:31,597
Come on, Max. It's our first stop.

861
01:09:31,847 --> 01:09:34,058
The old Grinchy Claus hissed.

862
01:09:34,183 --> 01:09:37,019
And he climbed to the roof,
empty bags in his fist.

863
01:09:37,102 --> 01:09:40,439
He'd slide down the chimney.
A rather tight pinch.

864
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:43,817
But if Santa could do it,
then so could the Grinch.

865
01:09:44,276 --> 01:09:47,863
He's planning a double-twisting
interrupted forward-flying 2-and-a-half...

866
01:09:47,946 --> 01:09:49,573
...with a combo tuck and pike.

867
01:09:49,698 --> 01:09:51,325
High degree of difficulty.

868
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:02,711
He got stuck only once,
for a moment or two.

869
01:10:02,836 --> 01:10:06,507
Blasted water weight!
Goes right to my hips.

870
01:10:16,475 --> 01:10:19,353
Then he stuck his head
out of the fireplace flue.

871
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:23,023
A little more stealth, please.

872
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:25,859
Where the little Who stockings
all hung in a row.

873
01:10:25,943 --> 01:10:27,027
These stockings...

874
01:10:27,152 --> 01:10:28,070
...he grinned...

875
01:10:28,195 --> 01:10:29,989
...are the first thing to go.

876
01:10:30,447 --> 01:10:32,908
Okay, fellas. Show time.

877
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:06,817
Then he slunk to the icebox.

878
01:11:08,152 --> 01:11:09,236
Slunk?

879
01:11:11,447 --> 01:11:15,367
He eyed the Whos' feast.
He took the Who pudding.

880
01:11:16,535 --> 01:11:18,662
He took the roast beast.

881
01:11:19,204 --> 01:11:20,289
Hike!

882
01:11:21,623 --> 01:11:23,917
He cleaned out that icebox
as quick as a flash.

883
01:11:24,043 --> 01:11:27,963
Why, that Grinch,
he even took their last can of Who hash.

884
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:32,551
Then he stuffed all the food
up the chimney with glee.

885
01:11:33,218 --> 01:11:34,845
And now...

886
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:36,847
...grinned the Grinch...

887
01:11:38,807 --> 01:11:40,601
...I'll stuff up the tree.

888
01:11:40,684 --> 01:11:43,687
And the Grinch grabbed the tree,
and he started to shove...

889
01:11:44,396 --> 01:11:48,067
...when he heard a small sound
like the coo of a dove.

890
01:11:48,192 --> 01:11:49,610
Excuse me.

891
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:58,869
The Grinch had been caught
by this tiny Who daughter...

892
01:11:59,078 --> 01:12:01,622
...who'd got out of bed
for a cup of cold water.

893
01:12:01,747 --> 01:12:05,167
Santa Claus?
What are you doing with our tree?

894
01:12:05,709 --> 01:12:09,630
But, you know, that old Grinch
was so smart and so slick...

895
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:14,176
...he thought up a lie,
and he thought it up quick.

896
01:12:14,718 --> 01:12:15,970
Why...

897
01:12:16,095 --> 01:12:18,931
...my sweet little tot.

898
01:12:19,181 --> 01:12:20,808
The fake Santa Claus lied.

899
01:12:21,183 --> 01:12:23,477
There's a light on this tree...

900
01:12:24,186 --> 01:12:25,604
...that won't...

901
01:12:25,688 --> 01:12:27,648
...light on one side.

902
01:12:28,107 --> 01:12:32,194
So I'm taking it home
to my workshop, my dear.

903
01:12:37,282 --> 01:12:39,410
I'll fix it up there...

904
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:43,497
...and I'll bring it back here.

905
01:12:45,332 --> 01:12:47,292
Santa, what's Christmas really about?

906
01:12:47,584 --> 01:12:49,378
Vengeance!

907
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:52,381
I mean...

908
01:12:55,009 --> 01:12:56,510
...presents...

909
01:12:57,594 --> 01:12:59,054
...I suppose.

910
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,893
I was afraid of that.

911
01:13:06,395 --> 01:13:09,565
And his fib fooled the child.

912
01:13:09,857 --> 01:13:13,193
Then he patted her head,
and he got her a drink...

913
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:15,696
...and he sent her to bed.

914
01:13:23,454 --> 01:13:24,455
Santa?

915
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:28,500
- What?
- Don't forget the Grinch.

916
01:13:29,293 --> 01:13:31,253
I know he's mean and hairy and smelly.

917
01:13:33,213 --> 01:13:35,674
His hands might be cold and clammy.

918
01:13:37,176 --> 01:13:40,679
But I think he's actually kind of sweet.

919
01:13:41,055 --> 01:13:42,139
Sweet?

920
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:51,649
You think he's sweet?

921
01:13:52,524 --> 01:13:54,318
Merry Christmas, Santa.

922
01:14:01,408 --> 01:14:04,328
And when Cindy Lou
went up with her cup...

923
01:14:04,453 --> 01:14:06,080
Nice kid.

924
01:14:06,997 --> 01:14:09,625
Bad judge of character.

925
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:13,504
...he went to the chimney
and stuffed the tree up.

926
01:14:21,595 --> 01:14:24,932
And the last thing he took
was the log for their fire.

927
01:14:25,015 --> 01:14:29,186
On their walls he left nothing
but some hooks and some wire.

928
01:14:29,311 --> 01:14:32,064
And the one speck of food
that he'd left in the house...

929
01:14:32,147 --> 01:14:35,484
...was a crumb that was even
too small for a mouse.

930
01:14:38,612 --> 01:14:42,866
Then he slithered and slunk,
with a smile most unpleasant...

931
01:14:43,033 --> 01:14:46,787
...around each Who home,
and he took every present.

932
01:14:58,048 --> 01:14:59,133
Clearance sale.

933
01:14:59,258 --> 01:15:01,218
Everything must go.

934
01:15:14,273 --> 01:15:16,233
What now?

935
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:52,811
Martha...

936
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:56,899
...have you ever kissed a man
who lost his tonsils twice?

937
01:15:58,150 --> 01:15:59,943
No, silly!

938
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:07,618
But it's an experience
that I've always longed for.

939
01:16:08,035 --> 01:16:09,745
Kiss me, you fool!

940
01:17:32,536 --> 01:17:34,580
What are you laughing at...

941
01:17:35,414 --> 01:17:37,374
...Rudolph?

942
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,544
It's all you, Maxie!

943
01:17:40,627 --> 01:17:44,048
3,000 feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit...

944
01:17:44,131 --> 01:17:47,718
...he rode with his load
to the tiptop to dump it.

945
01:17:57,645 --> 01:18:00,814
We did it!

946
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:08,030
We did it! We did it!

947
01:18:08,656 --> 01:18:10,699
That wasn't so bad, was it, Max?

948
01:18:14,578 --> 01:18:16,372
They'll be waking up now.

949
01:18:18,582 --> 01:18:22,336
And I know just what they'll do.

950
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,297
All those Whos...

951
01:18:25,714 --> 01:18:27,424
...down in Whoville...

952
01:18:27,549 --> 01:18:29,843
...will all cry.

953
01:18:47,987 --> 01:18:50,614
What an embarrassment!
I've been robbed!

954
01:19:20,686 --> 01:19:22,896
Mayor May-Who? Oh, dear.

955
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:33,324
I wonder who could have done this.

956
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:36,785
Tell you people one thing:

957
01:19:37,411 --> 01:19:38,954
Invite the Grinch...

958
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,457
...destroy Christmas.

959
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:43,667
Invite the Grinch...

960
01:19:43,792 --> 01:19:46,587
...destroy Christmas!

961
01:19:49,757 --> 01:19:52,509
But did anyone listen to me?

962
01:19:52,593 --> 01:19:54,303
- I did.
- No.

963
01:19:54,386 --> 01:19:57,389
You choose to listen...

964
01:19:57,556 --> 01:20:02,186
...to a little not-to-be-taken-seriously girl...

965
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:06,398
...who hasn't even grown into her nose yet.

966
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:11,070
Cindy, I hope you're very proud...

967
01:20:11,487 --> 01:20:12,738
...of what you've done.

968
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,540
If she isn't, I am.

969
01:20:25,709 --> 01:20:27,586
I'm glad he took our presents.

970
01:20:29,505 --> 01:20:31,298
- What?
- I....

971
01:20:34,093 --> 01:20:36,220
- I'm glad.
- He's glad.

972
01:20:37,096 --> 01:20:40,057
You're glad.
You're glad everything is gone.

973
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:45,437
You're glad that the Grinch
virtually wrecked....

974
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:47,982
No, not wrecked, pulverized Christmas.

975
01:20:48,065 --> 01:20:49,775
Is that what I'm hearing?

976
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:53,070
You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor...

977
01:20:53,153 --> 01:20:57,157
...because it isn't about the gifts
or the contests or the fancy lights.

978
01:20:57,241 --> 01:21:00,494
That's what Cindy's been trying
to tell everyone.

979
01:21:01,036 --> 01:21:03,247
And me. She's been trying to tell me.

980
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:06,750
What is wrong with you? This is a child.

981
01:21:07,626 --> 01:21:09,253
She's my child.

982
01:21:09,336 --> 01:21:12,172
And she happens to be right, by the way.

983
01:21:20,764 --> 01:21:24,977
I don't need anything more for Christmas
than this right here, my family.

984
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:31,567
- Merry Christmas, everybody!
- Merry Christmas!

985
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:37,072
Merry Christmas, you hunk of burnin' Who!

986
01:21:44,496 --> 01:21:46,123
Give me a break.

987
01:21:53,964 --> 01:21:55,049
Merry Christmas!

988
01:22:07,686 --> 01:22:08,854
Mr. Grinch?

989
01:22:10,314 --> 01:22:12,274
Mr. Grinch?

990
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:15,194
Now for the final note in my symphony...

991
01:22:15,277 --> 01:22:18,280
...of downright nasty not-niceness!

992
01:22:18,614 --> 01:22:21,867
The crescendo of my odious opus!

993
01:22:27,956 --> 01:22:30,501
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

994
01:22:31,001 --> 01:22:35,464
The bellowing of the bitterly bummed out!

995
01:22:36,006 --> 01:22:39,176
It'll be like music to my ears!

996
01:22:47,518 --> 01:22:51,730
Then the Grinch heard
a sound rising over the snow.

997
01:22:51,855 --> 01:22:55,901
It started in low. Then it started to grow.

998
01:22:58,278 --> 01:23:00,739
But the sound wasn't sad.

999
01:23:01,407 --> 01:23:04,201
Why, this sounded merry.

1000
01:23:05,077 --> 01:23:07,454
But it was merry.

1001
01:23:07,621 --> 01:23:08,789
Very.

1002
01:23:08,998 --> 01:23:12,918
Every Who down in Whoville,
the tall and the small...

1003
01:23:13,043 --> 01:23:16,296
...were singing without any presents at all.

1004
01:23:22,303 --> 01:23:24,930
He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming.

1005
01:23:25,222 --> 01:23:26,223
It came.

1006
01:23:26,348 --> 01:23:29,601
Somehow or other, it came just the same!

1007
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,024
Mr. Grinch?

1008
01:23:37,818 --> 01:23:41,655
And the Grinch,
with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow...

1009
01:23:41,739 --> 01:23:44,408
...stood puzzling and puzzling.

1010
01:23:44,742 --> 01:23:46,869
How could it be so?

1011
01:23:47,161 --> 01:23:48,954
It came without ribbons!

1012
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:51,749
It came without tags!

1013
01:23:51,999 --> 01:23:55,336
It came without packages, boxes or bags!

1014
01:23:58,422 --> 01:24:01,258
And he puzzled and puzzled...

1015
01:24:01,342 --> 01:24:03,802
...till his puzzler was sore.

1016
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:10,142
Then the Grinch thought of something...

1017
01:24:10,267 --> 01:24:11,977
...he hadn't before.

1018
01:24:12,227 --> 01:24:13,479
Maybe...

1019
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:15,981
...Christmas...

1020
01:24:16,065 --> 01:24:17,941
...he thought...

1021
01:24:20,235 --> 01:24:23,906
...doesn't come from a store.

1022
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,286
Maybe Christmas...

1023
01:24:30,621 --> 01:24:32,039
...perhaps...

1024
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,381
...means a little bit more.

1025
01:25:13,747 --> 01:25:15,332
Help me!

1026
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,292
I'm...

1027
01:25:18,335 --> 01:25:19,795
...feeling!

1028
01:25:26,593 --> 01:25:28,721
And what happened then...

1029
01:25:29,054 --> 01:25:31,598
...well, in Whoville they say...

1030
01:25:31,849 --> 01:25:34,518
...that the Grinch's small heart...

1031
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:38,522
...grew three sizes that day.

1032
01:26:09,928 --> 01:26:13,182
What's happening to me?

1033
01:26:36,664 --> 01:26:37,998
I'm all...

1034
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:41,126
...toasty inside.

1035
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,678
And I'm leaking.

1036
01:26:54,014 --> 01:26:55,099
Oh, Max.

1037
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,771
I love you!

1038
01:27:08,821 --> 01:27:11,907
All right, that's enough.
Knock it off. Beat it!

1039
01:27:12,574 --> 01:27:14,201
Get out of here!

1040
01:27:14,368 --> 01:27:16,245
One step at a time.

1041
01:27:24,628 --> 01:27:27,715
No. The sleigh. The presents.

1042
01:27:27,923 --> 01:27:29,299
They'll be destroyed!

1043
01:27:29,383 --> 01:27:30,759
And I care!

1044
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:33,804
What is the deal?

1045
01:27:34,638 --> 01:27:36,140
Wait!

1046
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:38,892
This can't happen!

1047
01:27:39,018 --> 01:27:42,187
It shouldn't! It couldn't!
It mustn't! It wouldn't!

1048
01:27:42,813 --> 01:27:45,274
Not now, not then, not ever again!

1049
01:27:55,534 --> 01:27:56,994
No!

1050
01:28:46,335 --> 01:28:47,336
Oh, well.

1051
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:50,631
It's just toys, right?

1052
01:28:52,132 --> 01:28:53,759
Hi, Mr. Grinch!

1053
01:28:56,011 --> 01:28:57,638
Cindy Lou!

1054
01:28:57,763 --> 01:29:00,057
What are you doing up there?

1055
01:29:00,808 --> 01:29:04,728
I came to see you.
No one should be alone on Christmas.

1056
01:29:21,203 --> 01:29:22,204
No!

1057
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,363
I got you, Cindy Lou!

1058
01:29:56,905 --> 01:29:57,990
You did it!

1059
01:30:40,032 --> 01:30:42,326
Spread eagle! Nailed it!

1060
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:01,637
Are you all right?

1061
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:03,180
Are you kiddin'?

1062
01:31:03,263 --> 01:31:05,724
The sun is bright and the powder's bitchin'!

1063
01:31:05,891 --> 01:31:08,352
Now scoot over! It's my turn to drive!

1064
01:31:15,859 --> 01:31:17,569
I'd better slow this buggy down!

1065
01:31:21,448 --> 01:31:25,119
- We're gonna crash!
- Now you listen to me, young lady!

1066
01:31:25,703 --> 01:31:28,247
Even if we're horribly mangled...

1067
01:31:28,998 --> 01:31:30,958
...there'll be no sad faces on Christmas.

1068
01:31:41,969 --> 01:31:43,345
What is it?

1069
01:31:43,846 --> 01:31:45,222
Help!

1070
01:31:45,472 --> 01:31:47,099
- Cindy!
- Grinch?

1071
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:51,270
My baby!

1072
01:31:55,482 --> 01:31:56,483
Grab an end.

1073
01:31:56,859 --> 01:31:59,403
By the way,
these lights match your outfit perfectly.

1074
01:32:02,114 --> 01:32:04,241
This could be more difficult to negotiate.

1075
01:32:04,742 --> 01:32:06,952
Heads up, Whoville!

1076
01:32:07,244 --> 01:32:09,038
Hurry! Here he comes!

1077
01:32:10,247 --> 01:32:12,791
Out of the way! I have no insurance!

1078
01:32:16,128 --> 01:32:17,379
Yeah!

1079
01:32:24,345 --> 01:32:25,429
Run for your lives!

1080
01:32:25,512 --> 01:32:27,556
Watch out, I can't stop!

1081
01:32:29,516 --> 01:32:31,894
- Daddy, move!
- Dad, move it!

1082
01:32:42,946 --> 01:32:44,114
Thanks for the help.

1083
01:32:44,406 --> 01:32:46,450
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, Cindy, honey!

1084
01:32:46,617 --> 01:32:48,661
Merry Christmas...

1085
01:32:49,203 --> 01:32:50,537
...one and all!

1086
01:32:50,663 --> 01:32:51,664
Cindy!

1087
01:32:53,749 --> 01:32:54,750
Mommy!

1088
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:04,468
All right.

1089
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:07,596
What do we have here?

1090
01:33:08,472 --> 01:33:10,766
You got me, Officer!

1091
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:13,185
I did it!

1092
01:33:13,268 --> 01:33:15,938
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas.

1093
01:33:17,481 --> 01:33:18,816
And I'm...

1094
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,734
...sorry.

1095
01:33:25,614 --> 01:33:27,324
Aren't you gonna cuff me?

1096
01:33:27,449 --> 01:33:30,953
Put me in a choke hold?
Blind me with pepper spray?

1097
01:33:31,078 --> 01:33:33,038
You heard him, Officer. He admitted it.

1098
01:33:33,998 --> 01:33:37,584
- I'd go with the pepper spray.
- Yes, I heard him, all right.

1099
01:33:38,836 --> 01:33:41,296
He said he was sorry.

1100
01:33:42,423 --> 01:33:46,093
Besides, it looks like everything
is all here and accounted for.

1101
01:33:46,468 --> 01:33:48,262
Help me out here, people.

1102
01:33:48,971 --> 01:33:49,972
Martha?

1103
01:33:50,055 --> 01:33:52,433
Merry Christmas, August May-Who!

1104
01:33:54,018 --> 01:33:57,354
I'm afraid I do have something for you!

1105
01:34:08,365 --> 01:34:09,867
Your ring back.

1106
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:11,535
Sorry...

1107
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:14,121
...but my heart belongs to...

1108
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:16,332
...someone else.

1109
01:34:32,431 --> 01:34:34,391
No hard feelings?

1110
01:34:41,649 --> 01:34:43,067
Cheer up, dude. It's Christmas.

1111
01:34:57,915 --> 01:35:00,042
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.

1112
01:35:04,963 --> 01:35:06,215
Your cheek is so....

1113
01:35:06,757 --> 01:35:07,841
I know.

1114
01:35:08,968 --> 01:35:09,969
Hairy?

1115
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:12,596
- No.
- Greasy?

1116
01:35:13,514 --> 01:35:15,474
Stinky? Do I have a zit?

1117
01:35:15,933 --> 01:35:17,017
No.

1118
01:35:18,686 --> 01:35:20,270
Warm.

1119
01:35:26,944 --> 01:35:31,991
â™ª Fah who foraze, dah who doraze â™ª

1120
01:35:32,116 --> 01:35:36,829
â™ª Welcome, Christmas, come this way â™ª

1121
01:35:36,996 --> 01:35:41,542
â™ª Fah who foraze, dah who doraze â™ª

1122
01:35:41,959 --> 01:35:46,755
â™ª Welcome, Christmas, Christmas Day â™ª

1123
01:35:47,089 --> 01:35:51,885
â™ª Welcome, welcome, fah who rahmus â™ª

1124
01:35:52,011 --> 01:35:56,890
â™ªWelcome, welcome, dah who dahmus â™ª

1125
01:35:57,016 --> 01:36:01,645
â™ª Christmas Day is in our grasp â™ª

1126
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:06,734
â™ª So long as we have hands to clasp â™ª

1127
01:36:06,859 --> 01:36:11,822
â™ª Fah who ray-moo ya-who hee haw â™ª

1128
01:36:11,905 --> 01:36:16,702
â™ª Welcome, Christmas, bring your cheer â™ª

1129
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:19,371
â™ª Fah who foraze â™ª

1130
01:36:19,455 --> 01:36:24,335
â™ª Dah who doraze, welcome all Whos â™ª

1131
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:25,919
â™ª far â™ª

1132
01:36:26,962 --> 01:36:28,380
â™ª and â™ª

1133
01:36:30,007 --> 01:36:31,800
â™ª near â™ª

1134
01:36:33,886 --> 01:36:37,389
So he brought back the toys
and the food for the feast.

1135
01:36:37,598 --> 01:36:40,351
And he, he himself, the Grinch...

1136
01:36:40,893 --> 01:36:42,686
...carved the roast beast.

1137
01:36:42,895 --> 01:36:44,229
Yeah!

1138
01:36:58,911 --> 01:37:00,537
There's nothin' like the holidays.

1139
01:37:00,663 --> 01:37:03,040
- Who wants the gizzard?
- I do!

1140
01:37:03,165 --> 01:37:04,166
Too late!

1141
01:37:04,291 --> 01:37:05,668
