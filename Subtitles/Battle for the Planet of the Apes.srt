00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:14,164
"In the beginning,
God created beast and man

3
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:16,875
so that both might live in friendship

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,795
and share dominion
over a world of peace."

5
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:26,885
"But in the fullness of time,
evil men betrayed God's trust,

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,432
and in disobedience to His holy word
waged bloody wars,

7
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:34,518
not only against their own kind,

8
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:40,941
but against the apes,
whom they reduced to slavery."

9
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:45,696
"Then God in His wrath
sent the world a savior,

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,574
miraculously born of two apes,

11
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:53,495
who descended on Earth
from Earth's own future."

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,501
"And man was afraid, for both parent apes
possessed the power of speech."

13
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:00,836
Come on.

14
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,018
"So both were brutally murdered."

15
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:04,691
"But the child ape survived, and grew up
to set his fellow creatures free

16
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:07,152
from the yoke of human slavery."

17
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,123
No.

18
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:03,310
"Yet, in the aftermath of this victory,

19
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:09,316
the surface of the world was ravaged
by the vilest war in human history."

20
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:14,738
"The great cities of the world
split asunder and were flattened,

21
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:21,245
and out of one such city our savior
led a remnant of those who survived

22
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,914
in search of greener pastures,

23
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:28,335
where ape and human
might forever live in friendship,

24
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,047
according to divine will."

25
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:35,384
"His name was Caesar,

26
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:40,097
and this is his story in those far-off days."

27
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:22,486
- You're not gonna make it, Jake.
- We'll make it.

28
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,237
I'll show you how.

29
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:47,594
- Thanks, Aldo.
- You will call me by my proper rank.

30
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:50,472
General.

31
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:52,599
Yes, General.

32
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,479
Don't put him in the corral.
I won't be long.

33
00:08:58,022 --> 00:09:03,443
"Ape shall never kill ape."

34
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:12,536
Shall ape ever kill man?

35
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:18,041
You're late, General Aldo.
Come and read this to the class.

36
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:22,003
- I won't.
- You won't because you can't.

37
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:25,465
And you can't
because you don't want to learn.

38
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,011
And it is my duty to report this to Caesar.

39
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:32,264
If my father were a gorilla,

40
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:35,475
we'd all be learning riding
instead of writing.

41
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:43,942
Silence. Silence.

42
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:46,736
Cornelius...

43
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:49,573
Remember - you are Caesar's son and heir.

44
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:53,410
Being a good rider isn't enough
for being a good ruler.

45
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:55,370
Though, in human history,

46
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:59,082
quite a number of military dictators
seem to have thought so.

47
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,961
Now, all of you, take your
charcoal sticks and parchments

48
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:04,921
and copy down what l"ve written.

49
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:08,174
The best shall be hung from these hooks.

50
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,429
I can think of better things
to hang from those hooks.

51
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:15,599
- But, Virgil, can we tamper with time?
- Accept my premise.

52
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:19,436
- What premise?
- Man learned to travel faster than sound.

53
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,397
He could have learned
to travel faster than light.

54
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:24,899
- We accept.
- Then imagine a musician

55
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:30,196
giving a live broadcast from London
to New York on a Wednesday.

56
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:33,283
He then travels faster than light
from London to New York,

57
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:37,871
where he arrives, as physicists
would confirm, on the previous Tuesday.

58
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:42,626
Listens to his own broadcast
on the Wednesday, dislikes its quality,

59
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,295
then travels faster than light to London,

60
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:50,133
in time for him to decide
not to give his broadcast.

61
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,801
Come. I'll prove it to you logically.

62
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,560
Good, Cornelius.

63
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:05,523
But you"ve made a mistake here.
You have put a b in place of the second p.

64
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:10,487
Teacher,
have you forgotten your own name?

65
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:15,992
Everyone has always called me "Teacher" -
I had forgotten. "Ape shall never kill Abe."

66
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:20,163
Thank you, Cornelius.
That was a very kind thought.

67
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,416
Gorillas?
All right, Aldo, let's start with you.

68
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,798
General Aldo.

69
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:41,685
With respect, General Aldo, this is barely
legible and will have to be written again.

70
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:46,106
Your capital A leans over
like a tent in a high wind.

71
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,906
And your capital K...

72
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,577
"Ape shall never kill Abe."

73
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:02,455
No, Aldo, no.

74
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,922
Teacher! Teacher.
You have spoken the unspeakable.

75
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:16,136
In all our years of slavery, "no" was
the one word we were conditioned to fear.

76
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,930
Caesar has forbidden you
its utterance in perpetuity.

77
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:20,890
An ape may say no to a human,

78
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:24,728
but a human may
never again say no to an ape.

79
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:29,941
Tell him you're sorry, Abe, and go home.
I'll put in a good word for you with Caesar.

80
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:41,828
General Aldo, I'm... I'm sorry. The writing
you destroyed was by Caesar's son.

81
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:43,830
I did not want you
to suffer Caesar's anger.

82
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:48,084
What do I care for Caesar's anger?
Let me give you a taste of mine.

83
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:13,651
Stop him.

84
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:25,955
Get him. Get the teacher.

85
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,470
Stop! Stop.

86
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,722
We'll teach the teacher a lesson.

87
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:46,017
Throw him in the corral,
where all humans belong.

88
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:53,608
I said stop, Aldo.

89
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:57,195
He broke the law. With his own mouth,
he broke the First Law.

90
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,407
- I am the law. What has he done?
- Caesar.

91
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:03,034
I...

92
00:14:03,118 --> 00:14:06,496
I was there. Teacher only
reverted to type under provocation.

93
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,500
He... he spoke like a slavemaster
in the old days of our servitude,

94
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:14,212
when we were conditioned
to mechanical obedience.

95
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:17,549
He uttered a negative imperative.

96
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:22,679
Could you put that into words
which even Caesar could understand?

97
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:27,433
He said "No, Aldo, no."

98
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:30,436
- The schoolroom was wrecked.
- The class is ended.

99
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:35,441
The schoolroom is closed.
Now we go back to riding horses.

100
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:38,361
Aldo!

101
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:44,117
You and your friends will return to
the schoolroom and put it back in order.

102
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:51,833
Abe, no gorilla is to be dismissed
until everything is back in its place.

103
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,877
- Yes, Caesar.
- Father?

104
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:58,548
Since there won't be any more
school today, may I go out and play?

105
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:04,888
- Well, can't you study in the house?
- I could, Father, but...

106
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,764
Run along and play.

107
00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:14,689
Where are my students? I was in the midst
of explaining my theory of time relativity.

108
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:20,361
- If Caesar permits, I would like to...
- Caesar permits.

109
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:23,072
- You look concerned, MacDonald.
- I am, Caesar.

110
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:26,576
I think that Aldo's hatred
is not confined to humans.

111
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:32,540
Look out!

112
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:44,010
I think Aldo may be riding for a fall.

113
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:51,267
If only my mother and father,
whom I was too young to remember,

114
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:53,353
if only they'd lived.

115
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:58,399
Perhaps they would have taught me
if it was right to kill evil

116
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,944
so that good should prevail.

117
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:04,614
But you know, Caesar, history shows...

118
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:08,952
Now that is human history,
not ape history.

119
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,954
Ape never kills ape.

120
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,795
Here's the list of
our winter supplies so far.

121
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,632
Well, l"ve gotta be getting along.
I'm starving. I could eat a horse.

122
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,843
- A horse?
- You remember Lisa.

123
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:29,931
They used to eat lots of things.
Dead cattle, dead chickens, dead pigs.

124
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:36,479
Now we live and chew nuts
at our masters" command.

125
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:40,316
- That will be all, Julie.
- Thank you.

126
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:42,402
We are not your masters.

127
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,825
We're not your equals.

128
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,910
MacDonald,

129
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:55,665
I believe that when you truly
grow to know and trust a person,

130
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,792
you cannot help but like him.

131
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:02,880
When we grow to know and trust your
people, then we shall all be equals -

132
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:06,134
and remain so until the end of the world.

133
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:09,679
- Which may be sooner than you think.
- You are such a pessimist.

134
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:14,392
- Or a prophet?
- Well, now that apes are at the helm,

135
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:18,104
Earth will sail safely
through space until the end of time.

136
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:22,942
And Virgil says "Time has no end."
So you see, I cannot believe you.

137
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:27,363
Would you believe it if you heard it
from the lips of your own parents?

138
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:33,953
- Are my parents alive?
- No.

139
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:38,708
- But their images and their voices are.
- MacDonald.

140
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,711
When you talk about my parents,
please do not speak in riddles.

141
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,046
I cannot see or hear them.

142
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,383
They came out of the future.
They cannot give me knowledge.

143
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:51,637
Caesar... You can see them.

144
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:56,476
You can hear them.
And they can give you knowledge.

145
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,271
- How?
- Under the dead city where we once lived,

146
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:03,941
in the archives
near the old command post,

147
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:06,402
there are tapes - sealed tapes -

148
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:11,240
of Cornelius and Zira being examined
by officials of the American government.

149
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:14,911
When my brother was Governor Breck's
assistant, he told me about them.

150
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:19,415
I know where they are. And I know
that they concern Earth's future,

151
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,918
from which your parents came.

152
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:25,046
But the city was flattened.
The bomb left nothing.

153
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,508
Except, I suspect,

154
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:32,762
the archives section - indeed,
many sections of the underground city

155
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:37,308
were designed to survive
the impact of a ten-megaton overblast.

156
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:39,143
Then the tapes and
pictures of my parents...

157
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:44,899
Are still down there.

158
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,984
MacDonald...

159
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:49,403
I want to see what they look like.

160
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:53,199
I... I suppose every orphan does.

161
00:18:53,283 --> 00:18:58,037
I want to hear
what they thought and knew.

162
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:04,460
The city's radioactive.

163
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,962
Yeah, well...

164
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:09,841
Let me see, who...
who is there among your people

165
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:13,261
who knows something
about radioactivity?

166
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:17,265
- No one.
- Among mine?

167
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,814
Who knows everything about everything?

168
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:30,987
Virgil. Go and find him.

169
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:37,618
Lisa, you remember your parents.

170
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:40,913
I was too young
when they died to remember mine.

171
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,751
But I don't want to have to remember
my husband. I want to love him now.

172
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:51,507
Look, Virgil will be with us.
Now, we'll take good care.

173
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:55,428
Say goodbye to Cornelius.
I don't want him to know I'm afraid.

174
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,601
Cornelius?

175
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,816
Cornelius.

176
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:18,492
Father.

177
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:23,873
- I'm going on a journey.
- What will you bring me back?

178
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:28,419
What would you like?

179
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:32,256
More nuts for my squirrel.
He's growing fast.

180
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:35,843
So are you.

181
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:39,639
One day you will be as tall as a king.

182
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:47,897
Mandemus?

183
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:52,068
- He's asleep.
- Not eternally, I trust?

184
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:55,279
Mandemus.

185
00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:57,323
- Who's there?
- Caesar.

186
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,752
- What does Caesar want?
- Weapons.

187
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,045
For what purpose?

188
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:14,715
Self-protection
in the pursuit of knowledge.

189
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,428
- Self-protection against whom or what?
- We don't know.

190
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:24,183
Why protect yourself against a danger
of which you have no knowledge,

191
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:26,936
in pursuit of a knowledge
you do not possess?

192
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,271
Oh, God!

193
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:35,653
- Is it a knowledge for good or evil?
- All knowledge is for good.

194
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:39,407
Only the use to which you put it
can be good or evil.

195
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:42,326
- Well put.
- Thank you.

196
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:47,665
The sun is rising. I should like to
get this matter settled before it sets.

197
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:51,460
Caesar has appointed me
not only as the keeper of this armory,

198
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:53,629
but as the keeper of his own conscience.

199
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:59,677
That is why I have asked six boring
questions, and propose to ask a seventh

200
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:04,015
before issuing or not issuing
the weapons you require.

201
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:08,519
What is the nature of the knowledge
you cannot seek without weapons?

202
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:13,607
The knowledge of Earth's ultimate fate,
recorded on tapes in the forbidden city.

203
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:20,072
Which is contaminated,
but still may be inhabited by humans.

204
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:21,407
Come in.

205
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:30,416
- Name your protective pick.
- Three submachine-guns.

206
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,377
- For?
- The removal of obstacles.

207
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,925
One...

208
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,511
Two...

209
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:48,684
- And three. Now what?
- Ammunition.

210
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,728
I really don't hold
with knowing the future -

211
00:22:50,812 --> 00:22:53,773
even my own, which is short.

212
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:55,775
A Geiger counter.

213
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:00,821
If we knew for a fact there was an afterlife,
and that the afterlife was bliss eternal,

214
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:07,203
we'd all commit suicide
in order to be able to enjoy it.

215
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:09,330
Pistols.

216
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:13,417
- To remove smaller obstacles?
- It's a three-day journey.

217
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:18,672
With Caesar's permission, MacDonald
may want to shoot, cook and eat a rabbit.

218
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:24,720
But who needs three pistols
to shoot one rabbit?

219
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:27,056
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

220
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:33,729
He may be old,
but he's got a mind like a razor.

221
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:36,107
When I was a boy, he was my teacher.

222
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:39,318
Let's collect our stores
and be on our way, huh?

223
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:43,757
There it is - or was.

224
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:47,219
Like a storm at sea, but solidified.

225
00:24:47,304 --> 00:24:50,973
By a bomb from an armory
1,000 times the size of ours.

226
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,893
And nobody to keep
its owner's conscience.

227
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:20,503
This is the hell
my forefathers used to speak about.

228
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,809
Do you know where we are, MacDonald?

229
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:22,856
Yes. Now, this is...
I mean was, 11th Avenue.

230
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:26,944
Ape Management was
two blocks east from here.

231
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:31,448
The archive section, two blocks west -
corner of Breck and Ackerman.

232
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,367
Get us there quickly.

233
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:12,114
The Governor's very irritable lately.

234
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:16,285
Who wouldn't be, living in this
hell of radiation all these years?

235
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:21,290
If the bomb hadn't killed the old governor,
boredom certainly would have.

236
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:25,002
Alma, I just want somebody to talk to.
Anybody.

237
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:31,091
We are at best brave
and at worst mad to be here.

238
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:36,430
This background radiation alone
will give us 300 roentgens per hour.

239
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:37,973
Meaning?

240
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:40,643
That unless we leave
this place within two hours,

241
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:43,812
we shall become inmates.

242
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:47,066
This is a ghost city.
I want to put some flesh on it.

243
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,817
Radioactive flesh?

244
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:55,908
Well, we're all radiated,
but at least we're active.

245
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,917
Getting stronger. We must hurry.

246
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:14,677
Governor, look.

247
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:16,595
- F6. F6.
- What now?

248
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:24,228
Alert Mendez.

249
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:28,273
Men... Mendez to Control Room.
Mendez to Control Room.

250
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:30,275
Mendez to Control Room.

251
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,823
Somebody's breached
the warning system at F6.

252
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:39,326
- One of our scavengers.
- No. It's been locked for years.

253
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:43,205
- It must have been someone else.
- Impossible. There is no one else.

254
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,041
Mendez, we have to act, and act quickly.

255
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,668
- Alma?
- Yes, sir?

256
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:50,170
Work the B console.

257
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:53,757
Quick, Mendez, quick. Quick.

258
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:56,385
No, quicker. Faster.

259
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:06,562
Keep going... No, no. Back. Back.

260
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:11,734
This is the place.

261
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:23,328
That's Caesar,
come back to reconquer his kingdom.

262
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:27,416
Doesn't he know that the bomb did that?

263
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:42,639
- We're still all right.
- This way.

264
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:50,314
Quicker. Quicker.

265
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:51,940
There. Hold it.

266
00:29:52,984 --> 00:29:55,778
Can anything live down here?
I mean, for long?

267
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:59,782
Yes. But in the end, not recognizably.

268
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:06,413
The black man is the brother
of my predecessor's personal assistant.

269
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:10,125
He supervised the archives.

270
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,212
I don't think I know the orangutan.

271
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:25,724
- Look.
- It's been there for years.

272
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:28,977
The late governor had this whole place
equipped with cameras.

273
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:31,897
To forestall ape conspiracies,
as I remember.

274
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:37,820
Archives. We haven't been in there since...

275
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:40,781
I wonder what the devil
they want in there.

276
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:47,538
We'll find the tape we're looking for under
the heading of "Presidential Commission."

277
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:08,100
"Proceedings of the Presidential
Commission on Alien Visitors, 1973."

278
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,856
- Is this it?
- Let's see.

279
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,233
Yes, that's it. Now, if this thing works,

280
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:19,778
the picture should come out
on that screen over there.

281
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:31,039
All security forces, alert.
All security forces, alert.

282
00:31:31,124 --> 00:31:34,585
Check out all sections in areas M5.

283
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:37,421
Apprehend three strangers
you will find there.

284
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:43,510
One human and two apes.
But caution. I repeat, caution.

285
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:47,139
If they resist, you may shoot.
But shoot to maim.

286
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:50,183
We want them alive for interrogation.

287
00:31:50,268 --> 00:31:53,395
If we shoot, we break 12 years of peace.

288
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,027
Yes, it has been rather boring, hasn't it?

289
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:06,658
My mother.

290
00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:08,243
Who won your war?

291
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:12,748
It wasn't our war. It was the gorillas" war.

292
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:17,294
The date meter on the spaceship.
What did it read after Earth's destruction?

293
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:21,965
3950.

294
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:26,637
And you talk to your pupils about eternity.

295
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:30,015
There are only three.

296
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:32,309
There must be more. But how many?

297
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:35,395
That's the question we'll have answered
when we get them.

298
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:39,316
My father.

299
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,526
That's my father.

300
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:43,946
How did apes acquire
the power of speech?

301
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,739
They learned to refuse.

302
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:48,617
On a historic day,
there came an ape who spoke a word

303
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:52,287
which had been spoken to him
time without number by humans.

304
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:54,498
He said "No."

305
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:05,717
No wonder all mankind thirsted for
my blood and wanted my birth aborted.

306
00:33:05,802 --> 00:33:09,137
In the year 3950,
apes will destroy the Earth.

307
00:33:09,222 --> 00:33:11,765
Not apes. Gorillas.

308
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:16,019
- Besides, that's only one future.
- How can there be more than one?

309
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:18,313
You remember the old motorways?

310
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,358
I believe that time
is like an endless motorway,

311
00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:26,405
with an infinite number of lanes
all running from the past into the future.

312
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:32,744
It follows that a driver would try
to change his lanes and change his future.

313
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:37,541
If you left this room right now,
you might wind up shot. Dead.

314
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:42,045
If you left a minute later,
you might survive.

315
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:48,051
It's a blind choice,
but you can change lanes.

316
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:50,971
I know what it is I want to change.

317
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,489
The camera. It moved.

318
00:34:09,574 --> 00:34:12,784
Are you sure?

319
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:14,703
Virgil's right.

320
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:20,792
Governor? We just lost the TV monitor.
Our 8-41 archive.

321
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:25,297
- I'm not interested in equipment failures.
- It wasn't a failure. It was destroyed.

322
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:52,199
- We have to find another way out.
- Is there another way?

323
00:34:57,538 --> 00:35:02,084
They got past you? Then shoot on sight.
Never mind about bringing them here.

324
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:06,421
Just get them.
Don't let anyone escape alive.

325
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:10,300
Sections M5 and R7 and 8.

326
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:14,096
Form a group here. Quick, quick.
All right, move out. Move.

327
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,348
Move! Move!

328
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:19,392
Hurry! Run!

329
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:20,519
Run!

330
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:26,608
Now you"ve got your guns,
we need another patrol quickly.

331
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,735
Quickly, men. Hurry. Hurry.

332
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,822
The rest of you,
take your weapons and go to M5.

333
00:35:31,906 --> 00:35:34,533
Go. Go. What are you waiting for?

334
00:35:34,617 --> 00:35:36,827
To R8.

335
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,152
All forces into exit level 3.

336
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:54,487
They're getting away. Kill them.

337
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:56,907
Kill them. Kill them!

338
00:40:02,802 --> 00:40:07,555
You knew every bolt and nut
in those corridors.

339
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,226
You have a hundred armed men.
How could you let them escape?

340
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,521
They were fast and smart, Governor Kolp.

341
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:18,608
Many of my men were sick.
And the chimp surprised us.

342
00:40:18,692 --> 00:40:21,903
Yeah... He surprised me too, once.

343
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:24,489
But he's an animal. He's only an animal.

344
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:28,743
No, Governor, he's more than an animal.
He can speak.

345
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:31,704
- So can they all.
- So speech makes them human?

346
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:33,790
Speech makes them intelligent.

347
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:37,585
And intelligence may make them
not human, but humane.

348
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,839
- Perhaps they came in peace.
- Idiot. They were armed.

349
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:44,259
From what we saw on the monitor,
only for self-protection.

350
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:46,386
Let them return in peace.

351
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,805
- To where?
- To wherever they live.

352
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:50,974
So that they can come back
and exterminate

353
00:40:51,058 --> 00:40:53,685
those of us the bomb
has not exterminated?

354
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:56,938
- Where do they live?
- They came with few provisions.

355
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:59,774
- It can't be too far.
- Which way did they head?

356
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:03,153
- They headed north, Governor.
- Organize scout parties.

357
00:41:03,237 --> 00:41:06,948
Assemble workable equipment
and follow them to their camp.

358
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:10,702
Yes, Governor Kolp.

359
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:13,496
Why, Governor?

360
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:15,957
So that we can exterminate them.

361
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:27,552
- It's Caesar.
- What a welcome.

362
00:41:27,636 --> 00:41:30,555
- We should have stayed in the city.
- The city is forbidden.

363
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,975
- I know. I forbade it.
- Then why?

364
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:36,561
If a king forbids
his subjects to wear a crown,

365
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:39,105
that doesn't mean
he can't wear one himself.

366
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:42,525
Caesar is Caesar.
He went to the city for a reason.

367
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,986
What reason?

368
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:50,450
I went looking for my past.
But I found our future.

369
00:41:50,534 --> 00:41:52,744
Explain.

370
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:58,917
- You wouldn't understand.
- Aldo will make the future. With this.

371
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:02,295
Well then,
Aldo may very soon be in the past.

372
00:42:21,815 --> 00:42:25,193
Cornelius.

373
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:28,696
Cornelius, are you all right?

374
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:32,700
- No, Mother. I'm just dead.
- Dead?

375
00:42:32,785 --> 00:42:35,537
- We were playing war.
- War?

376
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:39,499
Cornelius, hasn't your father
explained to you that war is not a game?

377
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:40,708
Yes, Mother.

378
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:43,211
And also forbidden you to play with guns?

379
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:46,756
- Yes, Mother.
- Then you'll stop it.

380
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,134
- Yes, Mother.
- Now come along. Father wants us.

381
00:44:12,926 --> 00:44:18,139
My friends, I have convened this
extraordinary meeting of the council

382
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:22,977
in order that I may report
upon an action which I deemed necessary:

383
00:44:23,062 --> 00:44:27,148
a reconnaissance expedition
to the forbidden city,

384
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:30,777
with Virgil and MacDonald as my aides.

385
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:33,321
Why MacDonald? Why not a soldier?

386
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:37,659
Because we went in peace
to what we thought would be a dead city.

387
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:41,663
But, in case there were some survivors,
we took MacDonald with us

388
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:46,042
so that he could parley with them
and secure permission for our search.

389
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:48,836
Survivors there are...

390
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:52,507
Maimed, mutated,

391
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:56,052
hostile and human.

392
00:44:56,136 --> 00:44:59,722
- Did the humans follow you here?
- We saw no sign of it.

393
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:03,476
But we must prepare for the day
when they may come out of the city,

394
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:06,396
when they may come to find us.

395
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:14,195
No humans in council.
No humans in council.

396
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:17,323
No. No. No. No.

397
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:32,004
Yes!
They are here because I sent for them.

398
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:35,133
Now that we know the danger,
we need their help and counsel.

399
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:38,219
No. No.

400
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,680
- Yes.
- Come.

401
00:45:40,764 --> 00:45:43,516
We shall not sit in council with humans.

402
00:45:57,489 --> 00:46:01,993
Now, let us reason together
and make plans.

403
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:08,583
Somewhere along the line of history,
this bloody chain reaction has got to stop.

404
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:15,006
A destroys B, B destroys C, C destroys A
and is destroyed by D, who destroys E.

405
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,632
Before anyone knows where they are,

406
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:19,093
there won't be anyone left
to know anything.

407
00:46:19,178 --> 00:46:23,431
Governor.
Governor, the captain has come back.

408
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:25,808
We found it, Governor. We found Ape City.

409
00:46:25,893 --> 00:46:27,101
Where?

410
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,814
This... This is a gorilla outpost.

411
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:35,985
Below is a valley with orchards
and vineyards - enough to feed hundreds.

412
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:38,237
- Here is Ape City.
- Was it very large?

413
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:40,865
- It is of a size we can deal with.
- Were you seen?

414
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:44,410
No, sir.
Caesar was busy with a council of war.

415
00:46:44,495 --> 00:46:46,496
One day soon they'll be coming for us.

416
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,624
No, we're going after them - now.
You have your orders.

417
00:46:51,168 --> 00:46:56,088
Caesar... On the Night of the Fires
you swore an oath

418
00:46:56,173 --> 00:47:01,969
that in the future, apes and humans
would live together in kindness and peace.

419
00:47:02,054 --> 00:47:05,598
Why are you now making every sort
of preparation to break that oath?

420
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:09,644
Because, unlike the humans in our city,

421
00:47:09,728 --> 00:47:15,358
those in the forbidden city are mad.

422
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:20,863
Mad enough not to want peace
and friendship, but enmity and war.

423
00:47:20,948 --> 00:47:23,658
- Did they tell you that?
- Yes.

424
00:47:23,742 --> 00:47:27,829
Yes. By opening fire on us
without giving us a chance to explain.

425
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:30,623
You were trespassing on their territory.

426
00:47:30,707 --> 00:47:34,126
But Lisa, we didn't know
the city was inhabited.

427
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:39,507
But how, if you didn't speak to them,
do you know its inhabitants are mad?

428
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:45,221
Lisa, you didn't see them. They're...

429
00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:47,682
They're malformed.

430
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:50,226
Like the freaks in
your foster father's circus?

431
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:54,355
- Were they mad?
- What's "malformed"?

432
00:47:54,439 --> 00:48:00,486
- Cornelius, go to bed.
- When l"ve given Ricky his water.

433
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:03,406
Lisa, freaks are different.

434
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:09,495
These humans are the
end product of nuclear radiation.

435
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,499
They're mutant, and they're mad.

436
00:48:15,878 --> 00:48:18,671
- Keep all emergency channels open.
- Yes, Governor.

437
00:48:18,797 --> 00:48:21,299
All emergency channels will remain open.

438
00:48:21,383 --> 00:48:24,635
If anything should miscarry,
I'll signal you as arranged.

439
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,554
Yes, sir.

440
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,806
Hurry, man. We need it.

441
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:38,524
The school bus will be operational,
Governor.

442
00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:42,445
The convoy will join us at junction C.

443
00:48:42,529 --> 00:48:43,946
Get moving.

444
00:49:35,374 --> 00:49:36,540
Ricky?

445
00:50:06,488 --> 00:50:09,198
Without guns, we have no power.

446
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:16,080
We shall take the guns,
and we shall keep them.

447
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:18,666
They equal power.

448
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,711
Guns. Guns are power.

449
00:50:23,964 --> 00:50:28,926
We are an elite. We are a superrace.

450
00:50:29,011 --> 00:50:35,182
We have the right to lead.
Without us, there would be no army.

451
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:39,228
What is an army without guns?

452
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:58,372
We need power. We deserve it.
We deserve to have power.

453
00:50:58,457 --> 00:51:02,334
We need power.

454
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:08,174
Guns. Guns. Guns are power.

455
00:51:08,258 --> 00:51:11,719
We shall get them,
and we shall keep them.

456
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:17,516
With guns, we will smash the humans.

457
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:23,147
All humans.
And then, we will smash Caesar.

458
00:51:36,078 --> 00:51:37,828
Look.

459
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:49,298
- It's Caesar's son.
- And he overheard every word we said.

460
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:52,176
Cornelius... Come down.

461
00:51:55,806 --> 00:51:58,599
Come down, or else.

462
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:01,829
Father...

463
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:06,458
Cornelius?

464
00:53:13,091 --> 00:53:14,300
Father!

465
00:53:53,006 --> 00:53:54,256
Cornelius!

466
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:35,422
I only heard about it this morning.
His squirrel is missing.

467
00:54:35,507 --> 00:54:39,176
- He must have been out looking for it.
- How is Cornelius?

468
00:54:39,261 --> 00:54:41,178
Hurt. He's badly hurt.

469
00:56:16,566 --> 00:56:18,150
Speak the truth.

470
00:56:26,326 --> 00:56:28,452
Even if we had a hospital...

471
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:39,004
I'm not going to tell Caesar. Not yet.

472
00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:41,632
He still believes he can change the future.

473
00:56:58,316 --> 00:57:00,651
Humans - going towards our city.

474
00:57:05,407 --> 00:57:06,865
I'll get him.

475
00:57:38,106 --> 00:57:40,607
Get ready to fire. Fire.

476
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:21,690
The doctor is doing her best.
I don't believe Cornelius can live.

477
00:58:21,774 --> 00:58:25,277
Caesar does. He...
he refuses to leave his side.

478
00:58:25,403 --> 00:58:27,196
How can a benevolent God

479
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,698
allow the branch of one
of His own trees to crack

480
00:58:29,782 --> 00:58:31,825
and injure an innocent child?

481
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:35,496
It didn't crack, Virgil. It was cut.

482
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:42,127
Order at council. Order. Order.
The humans are attacking.

483
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:46,298
They have killed one gorilla,
and they have wounded another.

484
00:58:46,424 --> 00:58:47,799
Tell them.

485
00:58:47,884 --> 00:58:52,012
We were scouting desert approaches
to the city and saw their army.

486
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:56,350
They fired. My companion was killed.

487
00:58:56,434 --> 00:59:00,312
- I have come to warn you.
- And how long before they get here?

488
00:59:00,438 --> 00:59:03,857
Soon. So now we must prepare.

489
00:59:03,942 --> 00:59:06,777
Take the humans out.
Lock them all in the corral.

490
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:13,784
Aldo. Aldo, you can't do this.
You're acting against Caesar's orders.

491
00:59:13,868 --> 00:59:16,036
Caesar is not here.

492
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:33,428
Hey. What the...?

493
00:59:38,184 --> 00:59:42,062
Jake... Strong man.

494
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:45,732
Take him to the corral.

495
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:53,282
Take all humans to the corral.

496
00:59:58,705 --> 01:00:01,248
All humans. Take them to the corral.

497
01:00:09,674 --> 01:00:13,010
Where are you going?
Martial law has been declared.

498
01:00:13,094 --> 01:00:17,472
- Everybody is to stay in their homes.
- By whose orders?

499
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:18,807
Go home.

500
01:00:23,438 --> 01:00:29,234
We want guns. Guns are power.

501
01:00:29,319 --> 01:00:32,112
Now we go and get guns.

502
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:34,865
- Mandemus.
- Who's there?

503
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:39,703
Aldo. General Aldo.

504
01:00:39,787 --> 01:00:42,164
- What do you want?
- Guns.

505
01:00:42,248 --> 01:00:45,375
- Guns.
- What will you do with them?

506
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:49,963
- We shall do with them what we will.
- "Do what you will" is the Devil's law.

507
01:00:50,048 --> 01:00:54,509
- And who are you, Mandemus? God?
- I am the keeper of Caesar's conscience.

508
01:00:54,594 --> 01:00:59,806
- And I am the keeper of Caesar's army.
- Under allegiance to Caesar. Where is he?

509
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:01,099
Mandemus, as I speak,

510
01:01:01,184 --> 01:01:04,436
our city is being attacked
by humans from without and within.

511
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,397
- Who cares where Caesar is?
- I care.

512
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:12,402
There is a law that weapons may only be
issued under direct orders from Caesar,

513
01:01:12,487 --> 01:01:15,781
not under threats from
a thick-headed subordinate,

514
01:01:15,865 --> 01:01:22,329
for whom war means only personal glory.
Now find me Caesar. I will listen to him.

515
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:24,498
First, listen to this.

516
01:01:28,836 --> 01:01:31,338
Take every gun in the place. Everything.

517
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:34,424
Get the ammo boxes.
Get the handguns, grenades.

518
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:38,637
Stop. Stop! Caesar forbids you.

519
01:01:52,151 --> 01:01:55,195
Well, there it is. Ape City.

520
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:58,532
When we leave, I don't want to see
one tree left standing,

521
01:01:58,616 --> 01:02:02,452
two pieces of wood nailed together,
or anything left alive.

522
01:02:02,537 --> 01:02:09,251
I want it to look like
that city we came from.

523
01:02:09,335 --> 01:02:12,295
What the devil is
all that rubbish down there?

524
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,756
Some sort of barricade, sir.

525
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:17,467
Nothing that a couple of
flame bombs won't take care of.

526
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:36,069
Caesar, forgive me,
but I couldn't get here before now.

527
01:02:36,154 --> 01:02:37,696
Aldo has seized power.

528
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:41,116
He's broken into the armory
and imprisoned all humans.

529
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,162
- MacDonald?
- He was dragged away by Aldo's gorillas.

530
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:52,377
I can't leave Cornelius. He needs me.

531
01:02:52,462 --> 01:02:57,424
Every ape and human
in Ape City needs you. Now.

532
01:02:57,508 --> 01:03:00,218
I... I think you should go to Cornelius.

533
01:03:09,687 --> 01:03:11,980
Father?

534
01:03:12,064 --> 01:03:15,025
They hurt me.

535
01:03:18,196 --> 01:03:22,407
They want to hurt you.

536
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:31,708
Who hurt you? The humans?

537
01:03:31,793 --> 01:03:34,795
No...

538
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:36,171
Then who?

539
01:03:40,802 --> 01:03:43,595
Shall...

540
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:47,224
Shall I be malformed?

541
01:03:51,604 --> 01:03:56,066
No.

542
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:01,947
One day you are going to be
as tall as a king.

543
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:05,135
Captain, lay the smoke screen, and when
I give the signal, start the bombardment.

544
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:09,139
Men and equipment out of the bus.
Deploy your weapons, quickly.

545
01:05:12,018 --> 01:05:15,061
- All is in order, sir.
- All right, let's go.

546
01:05:30,286 --> 01:05:34,873
He said they hurt him. Who?

547
01:05:34,957 --> 01:05:37,709
Who would hurt him?

548
01:05:37,793 --> 01:05:41,379
I think you'll have your answer - and soon.

549
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:48,720
- What do you know?
- That's what I know.

550
01:06:18,376 --> 01:06:21,461
- You did this.
- For security.

551
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:24,172
Did you raid the armory
for the same reason?

552
01:06:24,256 --> 01:06:26,216
- For security.
- Caesar.

553
01:06:29,804 --> 01:06:35,016
I order you to stop this. I order you to
stop it now and release those people.

554
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:45,944
See? Aldo was right.
War has come. Let's go.

555
01:07:17,768 --> 01:07:20,687
Go to the barricade. To the barricade.

556
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:48,506
Come on. Go to the barricade.

557
01:09:01,247 --> 01:09:03,498
They're laying a smoke screen.

558
01:09:15,553 --> 01:09:17,095
Here they come.

559
01:09:45,624 --> 01:09:49,711
- Where's Aldo?
- Probably the other side of the valley.

560
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:25,079
Hurry! Fall back! Fall back!

561
01:10:25,164 --> 01:10:27,624
Fall back. Go back to the village.

562
01:10:32,504 --> 01:10:36,674
Get away from the fire. Fall back. Hurry!

563
01:10:36,759 --> 01:10:40,970
Flee the barricade. Fall back! Fall back!

564
01:10:41,055 --> 01:10:43,014
Get back to the village.

565
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:51,040
You can't stay here any longer.
You must save yourself.

566
01:13:12,414 --> 01:13:13,623
Caesar.

567
01:13:18,962 --> 01:13:24,425
Your people weakened our city
by rebelling against your human masters.

568
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:28,971
But we who survive will create a new race.

569
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:32,850
And you and yours will be brought low.

570
01:13:32,935 --> 01:13:39,148
And you shall learn again
what it is to have a master.

571
01:13:42,236 --> 01:13:45,279
You're learning already.

572
01:13:45,364 --> 01:13:47,240
Clever ape.

573
01:13:51,245 --> 01:13:54,163
Oh, no.

574
01:13:54,248 --> 01:13:57,792
Ape. Clever ape.

575
01:14:00,045 --> 01:14:03,589
But then you always were clever.

576
01:14:03,674 --> 01:14:07,260
I was told how you chose your own name.

577
01:14:07,344 --> 01:14:11,848
But every Caesar must have his Brutus.
Did you know that, ape?

578
01:14:11,932 --> 01:14:15,810
Do you understand that, ape?

579
01:14:15,894 --> 01:14:21,065
And now Ape City is about to lose its king.

580
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:22,650
No, Kolp! No!

581
01:14:28,073 --> 01:14:30,032
Now. Fight like apes.

582
01:15:04,526 --> 01:15:07,778
No. Stop. No killing. Take them captive.

583
01:15:16,747 --> 01:15:18,956
Let's get moving.

584
01:15:20,918 --> 01:15:24,629
No. No, no, no. Don't kill them.
Take them prisoner.

585
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,100
No. No, Virgil.

586
01:15:52,074 --> 01:15:55,952
All right, Virgil. Let's go home.

587
01:16:02,876 --> 01:16:06,379
No prisoners. No prisoners.

588
01:16:19,017 --> 01:16:20,309
Dismount.

589
01:16:45,794 --> 01:16:47,670
Caesar! Caesar!

590
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,301
Hail, Caesar!

591
01:17:15,157 --> 01:17:18,576
- Let the humans go, Virgil. All of them.
- No.

592
01:17:34,968 --> 01:17:38,304
They stay. Aldo says what we do now.

593
01:17:38,388 --> 01:17:40,973
They have done nothing.
They shall go free.

594
01:17:41,058 --> 01:17:44,894
You like humans?
You want them out of the corral?

595
01:17:44,978 --> 01:17:48,731
All right. Kill them. Kill them.

596
01:17:51,902 --> 01:17:54,695
Kill them all.

597
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:58,074
Stop. Stop!

598
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:00,660
No more killing, Aldo.
Put down your weapons.

599
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:04,205
- Take them back to the armory.
- No. We shall keep the guns.

600
01:18:04,289 --> 01:18:06,832
Move, Caesar, or we shall kill you.

601
01:18:31,525 --> 01:18:37,113
Ape has never killed ape,
let alone an ape child.

602
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:51,127
Aldo has killed an ape child.

603
01:18:51,211 --> 01:18:55,798
The branch did not break.
It was cut, with a sword.

604
01:19:20,615 --> 01:19:25,953
Aldo... You... You killed...

605
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:34,670
Aldo killed.

606
01:19:34,755 --> 01:19:38,883
Aldo has broken our most sacred law.

607
01:19:42,888 --> 01:19:47,183
Our child... You killed our child.

608
01:19:47,267 --> 01:19:50,770
What's the matter with them?

609
01:19:50,854 --> 01:19:53,939
I guess you might say
they just joined the human race.

610
01:19:54,024 --> 01:19:58,736
Ape has killed ape. Ape has killed ape.

611
01:21:54,853 --> 01:22:00,232
You murdered my son.
You murdered my son.

612
01:22:07,157 --> 01:22:09,575
No.

613
01:22:40,065 --> 01:22:42,942
Should one murder
be avenged by another?

614
01:22:43,026 --> 01:22:47,863
Only the future can tell.
So let us start building it.

615
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:20,980
If we appear to be lacking in gratitude,
Caesar, what have we to be grateful for?

616
01:23:21,064 --> 01:23:25,234
If you mean to set us free,
then free us completely.

617
01:23:25,318 --> 01:23:29,697
- What do you mean?
- We are not your children, Caesar.

618
01:23:29,781 --> 01:23:32,992
We have a destiny too. As equals.

619
01:23:33,076 --> 01:23:36,412
Respecting each other.
Living together, with love.

620
01:23:36,496 --> 01:23:39,039
Love?

621
01:23:39,124 --> 01:23:42,334
The human way is violence and death.

622
01:23:42,419 --> 01:23:46,255
Aldo wasn't human, was he, Caesar?

623
01:23:50,093 --> 01:23:53,095
Virgil...

624
01:23:53,179 --> 01:23:56,765
You are a good and wise ape.

625
01:24:01,146 --> 01:24:05,858
And you, Caesar, are a good and wise king.

626
01:24:05,942 --> 01:24:10,029
We'll rebuild what's ruined
and begin again.

627
01:24:10,113 --> 01:24:14,283
Tell me something, MacDonald.
Can we make the future what we wish?

628
01:24:14,367 --> 01:24:17,036
l"ve heard that it's possible, Caesar.

629
01:24:25,128 --> 01:24:29,882
There. Every weapon is back
in its proper place.

630
01:24:29,966 --> 01:24:33,135
Caesar, I want to ask a favor.

631
01:24:33,219 --> 01:24:35,721
This armory's been my home for 27 years.

632
01:24:35,805 --> 01:24:37,890
You may live in it for the rest of your days.

633
01:24:37,974 --> 01:24:41,101
But I don't want to live in it. No, no.

634
01:24:41,186 --> 01:24:46,899
Now that the danger is over,
I want to see it destroyed, blown up.

635
01:24:46,983 --> 01:24:52,029
The greatest danger of all
is that danger never ends.

636
01:24:52,113 --> 01:24:58,494
And so, Mandemus,
we must be patient and wait.

637
01:25:00,163 --> 01:25:04,083
We still wait, my children.

638
01:25:04,167 --> 01:25:07,336
But as I look at apes and humans

639
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:12,257
living in friendship, harmony and at peace

640
01:25:12,342 --> 01:25:19,139
now, some 600 years after Caesar's death,
at least we wait with hope for the future.

641
01:25:19,224 --> 01:25:22,351
Lawgiver, who knows about the future?

642
01:25:24,935 --> 01:25:27,604
Perhaps only the dead.
