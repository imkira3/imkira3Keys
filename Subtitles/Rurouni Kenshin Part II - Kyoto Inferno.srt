00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,570
Settsu Mine, Hyogo
1878 (Meiji Era 11)

3
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,440
You're really sure he's here?

4
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,170
We've been watching for two months.
There's no mistake.

5
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,910
Let's end this here.

6
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,960
Be very careful.

7
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,080
Over here!

8
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,420
Who are you?

9
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,850
Halt!

10
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,120
Do you believe in hell?

11
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,960
Surely a world like this, awash in blood,

12
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,360
deserves the name hell.

13
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,390
Are you Makoto Shishio?

14
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,720
What if I am?

15
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,400
You know damn well!

16
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,830
Uh-uh.

17
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,500
Don't move from there.

18
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,070
I love that sound!

19
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,580
You bastard!

20
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,910
Why do you think I knew you were coming?

21
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,920
Hajime Saito of the Shogun's
<i>Shinsengumi</i> police.

22
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,520
A traitor...

23
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,930
We both remember the Shogun.

24
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,930
Are you content with
what this world has become?

25
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,540
Take off that new-government uniform.

26
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,210
Come and join us.

27
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,210
We will turn the clock back
to those days of upheaval.

28
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,950
I take orders from no one.

29
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,220
No?

30
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,720
Very well.

31
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,270
Shishio!

32
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,160
Man is born to carnage.

33
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,130
This world itself is hell.

34
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,490
Shishio!

35
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,650
RUROUNI KENSHIN: KYOTO INFERNO

36
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,390
Kyoto is in chaos!

37
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,330
What do the Shogun's police
think they're doing?

38
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,900
Indeed!

39
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,500
At least they shouldn't be
adding to the trouble!

40
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,500
Onward.

41
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
Who's that?

42
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,480
Here he comes!

43
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,520
Who are you?

44
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,190
That scar!

45
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,020
My name is not one worth stating.

46
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,330
I walk the streets of Kyoto,
dreaming of a new age

47
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,770
when the Emperor reigns supreme.

48
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,040
Bakkyusai the Killer.

49
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,710
I am he!

50
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,050
What nerve!

51
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,050
We will cut you down!

52
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,680
Have at him!

53
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,960
Why is Battosai the villain?

54
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,290
"Bakkyusai", not "Battosai."

55
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,930
Bakkyusai?

56
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Hang in there!

57
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:10,600
Asakusa, Tokyo

58
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,020
You're an old legend now, "Battosai."

59
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,690
Invigorate the Heart

60
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,700
Step in!

61
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,370
Hit him first!

62
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,570
Watch him!

63
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,910
Harder!

64
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,410
Shout out!

65
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,930
We have returned.

66
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,100
We're back!

67
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,130
Hello.

68
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
Sensei!

69
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,070
Why won't you teach us?

70
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,270
You're why we came here!

71
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,610
Please!

72
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,580
You're mistaken.
I am merely a guest here.

73
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,920
I am no master of fencing.

74
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,250
But...

75
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,620
The way of the sword has changed.

76
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,290
The motto of the Kamiya Dojo
is "invigorate the heart."

77
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,960
In this new age,
that is what the sword must teach you.

78
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,140
If it's a fight you want,
Street-fightin' Sanosuke's your man!

79
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,970
I don't charge much.

80
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,170
Well?

81
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,810
What do you say?

82
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,150
You want to fight?

83
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,480
Why not show them some stuff?

84
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,650
These days of peace have no need
for my High Heaven style.

85
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Kenshin!

86
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,420
Miss Megumi!

87
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,630
How's the clinic?
Business good?

88
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,460
Doctors don't talk about
"good business," you oaf!

89
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,300
I'll get dinner ready.

90
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,500
Wait. You have visitors.

91
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,840
You're Mr. Himura?

92
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,480
What would you like?

93
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,580
I'm Superintendent Kawaji.

94
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,490
Someone wishes to talk with you.
Would you come with me?

95
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,160
Hey! We're just getting ready
for dinner here.

96
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,690
Who sent you to come
waltzing in here like this?

97
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,530
Toshimichi Okubo, the Home Minister.

98
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,200
Who's that?

99
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,370
The top man in the government, that's who.

100
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,680
Don't go. It'll just be trouble.

101
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,710
Hey...

102
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,850
If he goes, I come with him.

103
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,690
I don't trust you guys
in the new government.

104
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Fine.

105
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,890
Come with us.

106
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,700
I won't be long.

107
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,210
Home Ministry

108
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,220
Excuse us.

109
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,200
It's been a long time, Mr. Okubo.

110
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,740
At last we meet again.

111
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,900
You know him?

112
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,380
I'll come straight to the point.

113
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,950
What is it?

114
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,450
Shishio is plotting in Kyoto.

115
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,090
Shishio? Who's that?

116
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,430
Another assassin.

117
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,930
What?

118
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,730
The successor to Battosai the Killer.

119
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,570
When you laid down your sword
at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi,

120
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,640
he was fighting there, too.

121
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,380
He was one of our assassins.

122
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,940
<i>In speed, skills, and quick thinking,
he was a match for you.</i>

123
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,110
<i>However, unlike you,</i>

124
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:49,850
<i>he cared nothing for the weak,
or for those with him.</i>

125
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,020
Victory!

126
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,650
It's the Emperor's banner!

127
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,860
We've won!

128
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,000
<i>Ruthless ambition.</i>

129
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:19,480
<i>A wish to rule for which
he will trample over anyone.</i>

130
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,510
<i>That's Shishio.</i>

131
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,150
I've won!

132
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,330
Well done!

133
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,040
We won!

134
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,510
Thanks to you!

135
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,740
You did it!

136
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,340
Well done!

137
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,910
You bastards!

138
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,690
Bastards!

139
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,230
You bastards!

140
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
Some of his assassinations were so brutal

141
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,770
they would have brought discredit
on the new government.

142
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,940
We had to eliminate him.

143
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,050
You put down your sword,
and his body was burned.

144
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,420
<i>He should have died, but then it snowed...</i>

145
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,530
He's alive?

146
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,670
He disappeared into the Kyoto underworld.

147
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:31,240
He's taken in a bunch of
bloodthirsty mercenaries

148
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,710
and formed his own private army.

149
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,180
He has one aim in mind,

150
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,580
to overthrow the new government.

151
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,050
Wait a minute!

152
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,920
He hates the government for a reason.
Why drag Kenshin into this?

153
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,600
He's destroyed every force
we've sent against him!

154
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,240
The only one we can turn to

155
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,610
is you.

156
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,080
Mr. Okubo,

157
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,120
you look worn out.

158
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,790
Building the new age

159
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,460
is much harder work
than destroying the old one.

160
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,360
Enrich the country, strengthen the military

161
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,140
I don't expect an immediate answer
to a request like this.

162
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,140
Will you take a week and think about it?

163
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,310
So, on May 14th, one week from today,

164
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,950
I hope you'll say yes.

165
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,630
<i>That's crazy!</i>

166
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,660
They want Kenshin to assassinate him?

167
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,500
It's not my idea!

168
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,140
They want Kenshin to clean up the mess

169
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,840
that they've made!

170
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,310
Bastards!

171
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,310
Not only that.

172
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,810
You will, of course, be well-rewarded.

173
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,650
And there are certain illegalities
we are prepared to overlook.

174
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,690
For example,

175
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,690
Megumi Takani's acquittal
on an opium charge.

176
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,190
That's bullshit!

177
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,030
If that's how they're pressuring him,
they can hang me first!

178
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,130
Tell me about it!

179
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,710
I won't let you go to Kyoto.

180
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,330
Kioicho, Tokyo

181
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:08,330
May 14

182
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,690
<i>Without Himura, the nation is lost.</i>

183
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,760
How do you do?

184
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,890
What the...

185
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,800
I have a message from Mr. Shishio.

186
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,310
"If you're thinking of sending
Battosai Himura against me,

187
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,970
"don't waste your time.

188
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,980
"This land will be mine."

189
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,330
There! Now it's clean.

190
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,170
Is this the time for laundry?

191
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,670
Tell them to take that job and shove it.

192
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,510
You really hate
the new government, don't you?

193
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,180
I hate people like that.

194
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,190
Kenshin?

195
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm going to Mr. Okubo's now.

196
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,370
Yahiko, will you hang these out?

197
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,870
Maybe I'll come, too.

198
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,880
No, it might get complicated.

199
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm best alone.

200
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,230
He's chosen life as a wanderer
who never kills.

201
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,530
He won't leave you and go to Kyoto.

202
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,640
Here he comes.

203
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,780
Let's go.

204
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
Ichiro Shimada, samurai!

205
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,080
Tsurahide Cho, samurai!

206
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,650
Villains!

207
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,260
Someone got here before us!

208
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,200
Okubo!

209
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,620
Mr. Okubo...

210
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,300
There were men planning to assassinate him.

211
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,810
We used that.

212
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,820
Was he one of Shishio's men?

213
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,490
<i>This is how Shishio works!</i>

214
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,330
He wreaks havoc using what he learns
from spies he has everywhere.

215
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,840
You never see his hand!

216
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,170
He'll whittle away at us

217
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,840
until the day he rises up.

218
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,350
Come with me.

219
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,370
Who are they?

220
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,210
Officers Shishio killed.

221
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,550
He's taunting us.

222
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:21,550
He sent them last night,
as if to coincide with today.

223
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,790
I will repeat Mr. Okubo's request.

224
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,460
You are our only hope.

225
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,970
Japan is about to lose its way.

226
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,570
Shishio will seize his chance.

227
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,810
It's war.

228
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,810
See you in Kyoto.

229
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,330
Extra! Extra!

230
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,900
Lord Okubo assassinated!

231
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,840
The Home Minister's been assassinated!

232
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:37,190
Assassins Kill Home Minister Okubo!

233
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,210
You're back.

234
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,610
Shishio did that.

235
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,720
We cannot let him go on.
I will go to Kyoto.

236
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,230
To kill

237
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,570
Shishio?

238
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,410
Even when you found out

239
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,750
I was Battosai the Killer,

240
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,250
you let me stay at your dojo.

241
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,190
That made me

242
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,590
very happy.

243
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:55,440
But to those who hate the likes of
Shishio or Battosai,

244
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,610
Battosai is who I remain.

245
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,440
But why?

246
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,120
Why do you have to go?

247
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,120
What do you care
if he hates the government?

248
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,960
Stay here.

249
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:23,030
Eat with us, practice
with us, laugh with us.

250
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,970
When I swore off killing,
Shishio took my place.

251
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,240
It is my job to stop him.

252
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,120
If you go,

253
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,420
you might fall back into killing.

254
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,830
No one can throw away

255
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,670
his past.

256
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,850
Thank you

257
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,850
and goodbye.

258
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,490
Once again,

259
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,830
I will be a wanderer.

260
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,860
That son of a bitch!

261
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,870
Damn him!

262
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,040
I'll help.

263
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,370
He took off alone and left me!

264
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,210
He doesn't want anyone in his way.

265
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,050
What?

266
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,250
Who'd be in whose way?

267
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,390
Don't start yelling at us!

268
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,890
That's not what I meant.

269
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,230
Kaoru! Why are you acting
like nothing's wrong?

270
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,100
Kaoru!

271
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,370
Of course she's upset, stupid!

272
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,080
You too, Yahiko!

273
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,080
Smarten up!

274
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,750
You shut up!

275
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,750
Damn it!

276
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,090
Hey! Come back here!

277
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,640
This is bullshit!

278
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,640
Damn him!

279
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,140
Damn it!

280
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,650
What do you want?

281
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,320
Battosai Himura.

282
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,160
Word is there's someone
like him around here.

283
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,490
There's no Battosai here.
Out of my way.

284
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,680
Perfect!

285
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,340
You want trouble?

286
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,350
You found it.

287
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
Where is Battosai?

288
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,520
Take me and I'll tell you.

289
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,700
Sanosuke!

290
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,770
Sanosuke!

291
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,730
Tell me before you pass out.

292
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,570
Let me think...

293
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,590
Stop it!

294
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,110
Where is Battosai?

295
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,110
Tell me!

296
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,780
I'm just a passing doctor. I don't know.

297
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,970
Odawara, on the Tokaido Highway

298
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,950
He's got a sword!

299
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,820
They were banned years ago!

300
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,510
Battosai's passed Odawara.

301
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,540
He'll come through the village.

302
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
Probably.

303
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,390
Let's arrange a welcome.

304
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,790
Could I have my sword back?

305
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,860
How?

306
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,300
It's of no use to anyone but me.

307
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,630
Yeah, sure!

308
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,310
If you're still keeping it
now that swords are illegal,

309
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,140
that means it's valuable.

310
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,000
Hold it!

311
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,340
Give me that!

312
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,340
But it's my sword!

313
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,850
Give it to me, I said!

314
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,970
Wait!

315
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,310
Please tell me

316
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,210
why you want it.

317
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,890
Excuse me.

318
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:06,060
This sword is a back-blade.

319
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,240
Only the back of the blade is sharp.

320
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,250
So the front won't cut?

321
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,420
My scabbard?

322
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,760
I thank you.

323
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,260
Who are you, anyway?

324
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,930
I am a mere wanderer.

325
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,770
Why is a girl stealing swords?

326
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,270
To pay for a journey.

327
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,040
That is no reason to steal.

328
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,780
Keep your advice!

329
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,780
Who's there?

330
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,260
Help!

331
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,130
Help!

332
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,970
Help my brother!

333
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,470
Brother!

334
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,970
Brother!

335
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,320
Save our village.

336
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,820
What happened?

337
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:43,660
I'm a constable.
I lost contact with my home village.

338
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,330
I went to see what was wrong.

339
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,510
Shishio found out who I was.

340
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,680
Eiji.

341
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,850
Brother!

342
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,860
Take care of him, will you?

343
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,200
Here's water.

344
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,640
Brother!

345
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,700
Brother!

346
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,040
Brother!

347
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,550
Brother!

348
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,550
This way.

349
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,070
Dad!

350
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,010
Mom!

351
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,290
Dad! Mom!

352
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,370
Animals!

353
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,940
Those animals!

354
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
Dad!

355
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,650
Mom!

356
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,820
Animals!

357
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,090
Animals!

358
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,490
Dad!

359
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,830
Mom!

360
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,780
You killed my mom and dad!

361
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,110
I'll kill you!

362
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,950
Who are you?

363
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,120
You want to die, too?

364
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,530
Are you Shishio's men?

365
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,370
What if we are?

366
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,440
Why did you kill those two?

367
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:17,710
Their son was going to tell the world
about this village.

368
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,390
They took the blame.
The penalty is death.

369
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,560
As an example?

370
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,070
Watch the boy.

371
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,900
Kill him!

372
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,990
Let's bury them.

373
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,500
Wait!

374
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,340
Leave them.

375
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,680
If we cut them down, we will anger Shishio.

376
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,080
We'll be helpless before him.

377
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,020
What are you talking about?
They're from your village!

378
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:38,590
They should never have gone
against Shishio!

379
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,860
No! Don't do it!

380
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,700
Mom!

381
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,200
Mom! Mom!

382
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,970
Mom!

383
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,040
Mom!

384
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,720
Dad! Dad!

385
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,720
Dad! Dad!

386
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,800
Dad! Mom!

387
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,170
So this is the world that Shishio wants...

388
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:42,590
Very well done!
Taking all these men by yourself.

389
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,430
So the stories are true,

390
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,100
Battosai Himura.

391
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,930
Himura?

392
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,270
"Battosai?"

393
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,610
Mr. Shishio calls.

394
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,190
Mr. Shishio! Please!

395
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,820
This sword deserves its reputation.

396
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:42,820
It cuts.

397
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,500
Your visitor is here.

398
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,340
You're Shishio?

399
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:14,850
At least say "mister,"
even if you had the job first.

400
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,020
Why this village?

401
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:26,360
You want the whole country,
not a few small places.

402
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,340
The hot spring here is good for my skin.

403
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:36,710
But without bandages, I scare people away.

404
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,210
So to spare them that,

405
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,710
I made the village mine.

406
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,050
Damn you.

407
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,890
Don't be mad. I'm just kidding.

408
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,720
It's a joke.

409
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,060
Is this revenge for what
the government did?

410
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:04,740
I don't care about revenge now.
Far from it. I'm grateful.

411
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,570
My injuries taught me a lot.

412
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,410
Trust, and you'll be betrayed.
Drop your guard, and you die.

413
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,410
Kill first, before they kill you.

414
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,250
The strong survive, and the weak die.

415
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,760
Reality, plain and simple.

416
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,600
I will make this country strong.

417
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:38,770
That is the justice I will bring.

418
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:40,940
Soon the whole land...

419
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:44,440
It is not you who sheds blood for justice.

420
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,120
Draw, Makoto Shishio.

421
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,790
I won't allow any more bloodshed

422
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:05,470
for this thing you call justice.

423
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:24,280
Sojiro, play with him for me.

424
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,290
May I?

425
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,260
In that case, I don't mind if I do.

426
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,630
What's that sword?

427
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,470
I'm disappointed.

428
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,640
I'll see you in Kyoto.
Come back as the real killer.

429
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,980
You're running away?

430
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,820
That's not nice.

431
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:59,490
Stick around and let's play.
Mr. Shishio says we can.

432
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:37,860
What's so funny?

433
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,700
Nothing's funny.

434
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,360
Nothing.

435
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,890
It's a battle of technique.

436
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,730
<i>They're both equally fast.</i>

437
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:22,900
<i>What will decide the outcome
is that one is happy to kill</i>

438
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,580
and one is not.

439
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,810
Look what you did to this sword!

440
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,990
Have a new sword ready
for the next time we meet.

441
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,330
Now's your chance!

442
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:29,900
Take revenge for your mother and father!

443
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,240
No!

444
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,070
Stop it!

445
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,410
Kill them!

446
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:58,430
You will please no one
by soiling those little hands.

447
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:08,440
The dead wish only that
the living be happy.

448
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,120
In time, those little hands will grow big

449
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,790
and you will be a man.

450
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:27,790
Do not use your strength to oppress,
like those who serve Shishio.

451
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:36,640
And do not let fear make you helpless,
like these people of the village.

452
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:44,140
Be a man who guards his family to the last,

453
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,650
like your brother.

454
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:46,540
Look what he did
to a Kotetsu Nagasone sword.

455
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,380
I underestimated him.

456
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,380
"Kotetsu Nagasone?"

457
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,720
A swordsman like you doesn't know him?

458
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:04,060
Most people would give their eye teeth
to have a sword he made.

459
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,730
That's good.

460
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,070
Very good.

461
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:15,900
Yes!

462
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:19,240
Excellent!

463
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,240
Welcome back, sir!

464
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,750
Have you done what I wanted?

465
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,250
We have all the weapons you asked for.

466
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,920
Sojiro.

467
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,090
Do something for me.

468
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,760
Anything but pay for that sword.

469
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,760
Summon the Ten Swords.

470
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,600
What?

471
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,770
You mean, at last?

472
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,110
When they arrive,

473
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,110
we go to war.

474
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,460
I can't stand this.

475
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,470
Stand what?

476
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,970
Get down to Kyoto.

477
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,310
Stop pretending.

478
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:27,980
I'm not pretending.

479
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,650
It is my opinion as a doctor

480
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,320
that while everyone might think
Kenshin is invulnerable,

481
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,000
I think he is a gifted
athlete, but otherwise

482
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:47,000
he's no different from us.

483
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:52,840
Where one wound might easily heal

484
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:56,510
multiple wounds add up.

485
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:01,680
And Kenshin's battle
hasn't only just begun.

486
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,180
There's more than guns or swords
that could kill him.

487
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:18,530
You'll regret it if you wait.

488
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,540
I'm going.

489
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:30,380
He'll face more than just Shishio.

490
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,380
But you're still hurt!

491
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:38,880
Quiet! I'll heal up on the road.

492
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,720
I'll toughen up.

493
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,720
Wait!

494
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,560
Then take this.

495
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,060
An elixir.

496
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:59,070
An old family recipe. Take it once a day.

497
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,070
And this.

498
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,580
It's salve.

499
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:14,590
Give Kenshin some, too.

500
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,260
Thanks.

501
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:22,760
But,

502
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:27,270
you bring it.

503
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,270
It's not my job to heal his wounds.

504
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,450
Right!

505
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,120
Right!

506
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:47,620
I'm on my way!

507
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:14,210
Kyoto

508
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,330
Found you!

509
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:34,500
I almost lost you!

510
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,510
Have you got a place to stay?

511
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:42,010
I know a good, cheap inn.

512
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,850
- No, thank you.
- Wait, wait, wait!

513
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,850
I'm Misao Makimachi.
I'm not a villain.

514
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,190
Trust me.

515
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,990
Come on!

516
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,030
There it is!

517
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,200
But...

518
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,710
I'm back!

519
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,540
Hey!

520
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,710
A guest!

521
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,210
Welcome!

522
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:18,550
Elder?

523
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:21,950
I'm back!

524
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,050
Misao!

525
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,650
Come here!

526
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:26,220
I'll take your things.

527
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,120
Don't be shy.

528
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:29,720
But...

529
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,060
He helped me out.

530
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,560
Let him stay, all right?

531
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,070
We'll charge through the nose!

532
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,070
Just kidding!

533
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,540
Hello.

534
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,240
You're welcome here,

535
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:47,080
Battosai Himura.

536
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,080
Yes.

537
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,750
The Battosai Himura

538
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,250
Aoshi's looking for.

539
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,270
Please...

540
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,440
You've had a long journey.

541
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,110
Thank you.

542
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:26,450
It's been ten years since
you were in Kyoto, Battosai.

543
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,960
I've always thought

544
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:42,970
some day we would meet.

545
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,900
I never thought it would
be here, like this.

546
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:49,570
You are?

547
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,480
I am a ninja, one of the Hidden Watchers

548
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:56,980
who was stationed with
the Kyoto Constabulary.

549
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,480
So Miss Misao...

550
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,150
Yes.

551
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:06,660
The Shogunate assigned me
to gather information

552
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:13,830
in the guise of an innkeeper,
as you see me now.

553
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,770
When all of you brought down the Shogun,

554
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,770
this became my living.

555
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,180
But there were those among
the Shogun's servants

556
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:33,680
for whom the transition was not so easy.

557
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:49,200
<i>One of the Watchers
stationed outside Edo Castle</i>

558
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,200
<i>was Aoshi Shinomori.</i>

559
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,210
You remember the two sides agreed
Edo Castle would be surrendered

560
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,890
and there would be no bloodshed
in Edo itself.

561
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,220
Had that not happened,

562
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:16,230
you would probably have encountered him.

563
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,900
You were the two champions of each side.

564
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:29,580
The Watchers were given
no opportunity to fight.

565
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,210
And to make sure we wouldn't,
the Shogun's men...

566
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:41,390
Why are you doing this to us?

567
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:47,160
Intruder!

568
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:53,870
<i>Even though the new government
had offered him a post,</i>

569
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:59,870
<i>Aoshi still tried to save his men
from death at the Shogun's hands.</i>

570
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:05,750
Captain!

571
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,580
So the victors write the history?

572
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,860
And we're flung into the dark?

573
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,190
Ryujo!

574
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,030
Shoot them!

575
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,600
Captain! Live on!

576
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:29,300
Long live the Watchers!

577
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:37,810
Long may our name live!

578
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:50,560
<i>With no companions to preserve,
or Shogunate to hate,</i>

579
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,260
<i>all of his anger and despair</i>

580
01:08:54,660 --> 01:09:00,970
<i>turned on Battosai Himura,
the greatest fighter of the age.</i>

581
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,510
He aims to kill you

582
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:15,620
and, before the graves
of his dead comrades,

583
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,790
proclaim the Watchers as
the mightiest of all.

584
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,160
And Miss Misao?

585
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:31,370
<i>She doesn't know the demon he's become.</i>

586
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:36,200
<i>She still pines for him.</i>

587
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:44,050
I understand.

588
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:49,380
However, I have come to Kyoto

589
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:54,720
to put an end to Shishio.

590
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:57,060
I see.

591
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:05,740
After ten years,
Battosai comes back to Kyoto.

592
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,910
I knew there had to be a reason.

593
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:18,910
The Hidden Watchers network
of informants remains in place.

594
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:25,090
If you have need of us,
please do not hesitate to ask.

595
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,000
I'll take you up on that.

596
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,100
Yes?

597
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:39,270
Could you find someone for me?

598
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,450
The father of this sword,

599
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,450
Shakku Arai.

600
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:59,120
Let's find him right away.

601
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,480
Excuse us.

602
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:29,150
Another guest.

603
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,160
Make yourself at home.

604
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:34,990
You're here?

605
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:40,330
Everyone knows who you are.

606
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:54,510
Takano, Kyoto Police.

607
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,850
These are Shishio's villages.

608
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,690
The government has abandoned
about a dozen.

609
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,030
They're under Shishio's control.

610
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:15,330
Where's the army?

611
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:17,040
They could fix this!

612
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,170
I'm afraid

613
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:25,710
we cannot afford to show weakness
in the face of the Western powers.

614
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,380
They're just all afraid

615
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:31,380
they'll end up like Okubo.

616
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:33,720
Then what do we do?

617
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:37,560
The way we're going,
we play right into Shishio's hands.

618
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:46,730
That's exactly the reason
we're all here now.

619
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:13,590
Permission to enter!

620
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,430
That was quick.

621
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,940
I only live over in Osaka.

622
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:29,940
Take it easy here till the others arrive.

623
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,110
Yumi...

624
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,350
So?

625
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,420
Where's Battosai now?

626
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,460
Kyoto, we think.

627
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:49,130
Probably looking for a sword
to replace the one Sojiro broke.

628
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:54,470
Battosai's sword would have come
from the best swordsmith.

629
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,800
That means Shakku Arai.

630
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,640
You can always depend on Cho
to know those things.

631
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:09,820
Battosai's a bit of a fool, isn't he?

632
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:14,490
Trying to get a dead man
to make him a sword.

633
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,510
Shakku...

634
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:37,180
Shakku Arai, d. 1870

635
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,410
<i>Himura!</i>

636
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:43,350
So you're going?

637
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:55,370
Without killing anymore,
I will try to preserve

638
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:59,540
those who seek to bring about a new age.

639
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:07,380
Well, if you find a way,
I sure hope you'll tell me.

640
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:13,620
A farewell gift.

641
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:18,890
Try being a swordsman
wearing one of those.

642
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:25,230
Then you'll know
what you're saying is nonsense.

643
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,470
The blade's

644
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,500
on the back?

645
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:38,080
If your head's still full
of that nonsense when it breaks,

646
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:42,680
come back to Kyoto and find me again.

647
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,450
Seiku! Someone's here.

648
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:17,620
Coming.

649
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,420
Can I help you?

650
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,290
Mr. Seiku Arai?

651
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,030
Yes.

652
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,630
I owe your father a great
debt of gratitude.

653
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,470
Learning he has passed away,
I have come with a request.

654
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,140
Could you please make me a sword?

655
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,320
My father would often say

656
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:57,990
how his swords would create a new age.

657
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:06,670
But the truth is that
those swords took many lives.

658
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,340
You can say it was the times,
and it had to be that way

659
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,510
but this is the new age.

660
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,850
Killing to change the world...

661
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:32,030
The new age no longer requires
those weapons or that logic.

662
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,700
Now I make kitchen knives
or things for everyday use.

663
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,210
I'm sorry, but I will never make
another sword.

664
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,210
Very well.

665
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:57,550
I'm sorry to bother you.

666
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,410
Wow! So this is Kyoto!

667
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:34,490
Hey!

668
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:35,860
Stop leering!

669
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,920
That hurt!

670
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:40,760
Save that for when you grow up.

671
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,360
I'm just looking!

672
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:46,600
We're here to find Kenshin,
so get looking for him.

673
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:48,440
Yeah, I know.

674
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,280
Windmills for sale!

675
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:58,610
Windmills! Come and get one!

676
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,180
Look!

677
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:05,850
Windmills! Windmills for sale!

678
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,140
Hey!

679
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:24,470
What are you doing?

680
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:25,810
What's wrong?

681
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,250
I'm just playing with him.

682
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,650
What's the problem?

683
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,820
He's got Iori!

684
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:42,660
Who would you be?

685
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:46,330
Do you wish something of me?

686
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:52,300
You're Shakku Arai's son Seiku?

687
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,000
Rumor has it

688
01:19:56,670 --> 01:20:00,010
that you've still got
the last sword your dad made.

689
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,850
No one's ever used it, right?

690
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,850
Can I see it?

691
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,130
What's wrong?

692
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,200
Mr. Himura!

693
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,800
The police!

694
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:25,200
Get the police!

695
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,540
Our baby!

696
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:28,370
Our baby!

697
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:31,540
Calm down, will you!

698
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:41,890
Come on now! Don't cry!

699
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,050
I'll shut you up soon enough.

700
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,900
Who are you?

701
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,570
Give back the child.

702
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:07,580
Two scars crossed on your left cheek...

703
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:11,250
So you're the famous killer,

704
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,920
Battosai Himura?

705
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:18,590
I hear your sword broke.

706
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:23,430
So you're here for
Shakku's last sword, too?

707
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:26,260
What do you mean?

708
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,270
You mean you don't care if I step in here?

709
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,940
Then get lost.

710
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:36,610
Give back the child.

711
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:39,110
Why?

712
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:44,950
If I get his last sword
but I can't try it out,

713
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:48,290
where's the fun in that?

714
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,230
There's a fight going on!

715
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,000
Fight!

716
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:37,500
Call the police!

717
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:40,170
Aw, just leave them.

718
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:42,510
What's going on?

719
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,780
Some ex-samurais are fighting
over in that shrine.

720
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:48,010
You'd better keep away!

721
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,020
Come on!

722
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,690
Draw your damn sword!

723
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:15,540
You're good, I'll give you that.

724
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:20,210
But this prize is going to cost you!

725
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:39,070
Iori!

726
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:40,370
Stay back!

727
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:45,570
Are we done?

728
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:50,410
You're going to risk your life
just to save one kid?

729
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,100
What's that look?

730
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:12,270
You're pissing me off!

731
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:15,940
I killed many

732
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:20,840
to bring about a new age.

733
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,450
Are you bragging?

734
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:26,450
Be my guest.

735
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:30,790
Go ahead and cling to
the glories of the past.

736
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,620
What a loser!

737
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,790
Ten years since struggle and blood
brought us to a new age.

738
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:44,800
Now, in a happy home
that knows nothing of war,

739
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:51,470
we begin to see a time of peace
in which to raise its children.

740
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:59,980
Think what you will, but that child
is the blessing of the new age.

741
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,170
If it costs me my life,

742
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:23,510
I will take him back.

743
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,020
A real hero of justice, huh?

744
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:44,190
My father's last killing swords!

745
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,550
Wait, Iori! Just a little bit longer!

746
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,070
<i>I'll take the chance!</i>

747
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:25,900
<i>If anyone can put that sword
to good use, it's him!</i>

748
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,940
Father! Watch over us!

749
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:35,710
Damn you!

750
01:28:22,690 --> 01:28:23,760
Kenshin!

751
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,360
That hurt!

752
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,030
Who's that?

753
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,530
Where's his sword?

754
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,540
Mr. Himura! Take this!

755
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:53,520
It's my father's last sword! Use it!

756
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:58,560
So there was one!

757
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:01,400
That sword will be mine!

758
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:07,000
Draw.

759
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:12,570
We'll have a real fight.
Let's see who wins.

760
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:26,590
Well? You're Battosai
the Killer, aren't you?

761
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:30,930
My sword's out. Where's yours?

762
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:38,770
Fine! If you've forgotten
how good killing feels.

763
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:41,440
I'll remind you.

764
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:44,110
I'll do one right now!

765
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,440
Iori!

766
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:47,280
Iori!

767
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,110
Wait there.

768
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:52,280
I'll cut you into pieces.

769
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,180
No killing!

770
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,130
You know,

771
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,470
you're really good.

772
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:19,140
Iori!

773
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,810
Iori!

774
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,150
Iori!

775
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,050
Kenshin...

776
01:30:38,830 --> 01:30:40,100
Kenshin?

777
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,080
He's not dead.

778
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:59,680
Kaoru! He didn't kill him!

779
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:01,520
That's a back-blade.

780
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:15,030
I'm glad!

781
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:21,870
Iori!

782
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:27,710
Iori!

783
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,010
Iori!

784
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,050
He's fine!

785
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:36,720
On your feet!

786
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,220
Get him up!

787
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:43,130
Bring him!

788
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:47,230
Walk!

789
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:51,040
Kenshin! Are you okay?

790
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,070
Is that a new back-blade?

791
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,080
Hey...

792
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,580
Hey, Kenshin...

793
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,590
Kenshin...

794
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:21,560
<i>Seiku,</i>

795
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,400
what's this?

796
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:32,840
The true back-blade.

797
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,010
"True?"

798
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:42,350
The sword he made for the gods

799
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:47,190
out of remorse, mixed
with a tiny bit of hope.

800
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:54,700
When you dedicate a sword
to the gods, you forge two.

801
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:59,200
The better one is "true."
You give that to the gods.

802
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:06,040
The other one is the "shadow."
You let someone else have that.

803
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,040
So...

804
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:11,380
Yes.

805
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:18,050
The one he gave you was the shadow.

806
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:28,560
Have that sword.

807
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,900
Father would have wanted that.

808
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:55,590
"Reluctantly, for years,
I have tempered swords.

809
01:34:57,190 --> 01:35:00,930
"Not for the world of my son,
but to bring peace for his child."

810
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,270
Kenshin, I'm coming in.

811
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,440
Did you rest?

812
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:16,210
Yeah.

813
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:17,850
Right, Kaoru?

814
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,290
Are you angry?

815
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,960
About me following you to Kyoto?

816
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:36,470
Half.

817
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,800
The other half

818
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,140
relieved.

819
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:50,980
Shishio's men are everywhere.

820
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,990
Be very careful.

821
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,830
See? I told you.

822
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:05,830
When a woman follows a man,
he acts like she's a pest,

823
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,330
but he's still happy about it.

824
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:13,500
You be quiet. You don't know
what you're talking about.

825
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,190
<i>Shakku,</i>

826
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:36,190
<i>I'm just like you.
My head's still full of nonsense.</i>

827
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:41,530
Thanks for coming out!

828
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:44,340
I greet the Ten Swords!

829
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,540
Hoji!

830
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:48,040
Take charge.

831
01:36:56,710 --> 01:37:00,220
Tomorrow, at one minute to midnight,

832
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:04,220
we make Kyoto an inferno!

833
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,670
You hear that, comrades?
The time has come at last!

834
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,240
Those lazy fools will feel

835
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:23,470
our power to the full!

836
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,790
You're Cho the Sword Hunter,

837
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,460
one of Shishio's Ten Swords.

838
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:18,300
Are you not?

839
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:23,800
So what's the big deal?

840
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:26,540
What's he planning?

841
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:44,160
Tell us and it'll go easier on you.

842
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:50,830
It's time to stop being loyal to Shishio.

843
01:38:54,330 --> 01:39:00,340
What are you talking about?
I'm not loyal to Shishio.

844
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:04,950
He was just a way to get where I wanted.

845
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,200
The guy you beat up talked.

846
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:29,040
Shishio's burning Kyoto.

847
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:32,870
That's been planned before.

848
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:39,550
In the days of the Shogun,
when we raided the Ikedaya.

849
01:39:40,450 --> 01:39:43,220
We were in time to stop them.

850
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,390
And Shishio wants to
try the same thing again?

851
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:52,060
Probably to prove that this government
can't stop them now.

852
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:58,730
But why would Cho just tell you
something that important?

853
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:06,080
They're a bunch of hoodlums.
There's always one who'll talk.

854
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:10,410
It's set for tomorrow
at one minute to midnight.

855
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:45,450
Shishio is plotting something
for the night of the waning moon.

856
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:48,450
Sniff the wind.

857
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:53,120
Kyoto, a sea of fire?

858
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:55,960
If we allow it,

859
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,800
many will die.

860
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:04,800
We have deep roots here in Kyoto.

861
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:07,640
He won't get away with it.

862
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:10,470
Misao, send pigeons.

863
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:12,140
Tell all Kyoto.

864
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:13,210
I will.

865
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,750
Kurojo, Shirojo,

866
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,480
Masugami, Omime.

867
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:19,480
Dress for action.

868
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:26,320
We'll show them what
the Hidden Watchers can do!

869
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,180
The north side!

870
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,210
Stay in your homes!

871
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:20,150
Martial Law is declared for all of Kyoto!

872
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:56,980
Kenshin!

873
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:02,120
We'll fight, too.

874
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:04,820
But...

875
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:07,660
I made up my mind before I came.

876
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:11,660
I'll see this through to the end.

877
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:15,300
Me, too. You can see what I've learned.

878
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:21,000
Let's go.

879
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:26,010
Don't try too much.

880
01:44:32,010 --> 01:44:33,250
Stay with them.

881
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:39,190
This is a fight to the death.

882
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:43,690
A fencing instructor won't help.

883
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:57,970
Come and fight with us.

884
01:44:59,110 --> 01:45:00,140
Let's go.

885
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:17,360
They're here.

886
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:31,740
Take your positions.

887
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:46,760
Sojiro.

888
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:48,590
Yes?

889
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,430
Remember my souvenir.

890
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:54,360
I will.

891
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,610
Set them off.

892
01:46:08,110 --> 01:46:09,280
Yes, sir.

893
01:47:50,350 --> 01:47:53,550
Everybody, be on your guard.

894
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,600
Riflemen, forward!

895
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:52,910
On your honor as police officers,
stop them in their tracks!

896
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:54,680
All right!

897
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:00,290
Burn the place!

898
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:03,120
Fire!

899
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,070
Police!

900
01:49:16,270 --> 01:49:17,940
Kill!

901
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:19,810
Fire!

902
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:22,810
Men!

903
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:23,880
Charge!

904
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,670
You're getting better.

905
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:30,680
I am Yahiko Myojin, samurai of Tokyo!

906
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:39,790
Bring fire!

907
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:42,520
We know what you're planning!

908
01:51:56,770 --> 01:52:01,140
Thanks for coming out this late at night!

909
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:05,980
Street-fightin' Sanosuke's in town!

910
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:37,780
He's back.

911
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:41,110
Go on ahead.

912
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:58,800
Where's Battosai?

913
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:06,040
I heard you're sheltering a man
with crossed scars on his cheek.

914
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:14,720
You know how hard
Misao's been looking for you?

915
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:20,190
She still believes
you're the man you always were.

916
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,220
That is of no concern.

917
01:53:23,190 --> 01:53:27,900
He is a valued guest here at the Aoiya.

918
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,970
Hiding in plain sight, is he?

919
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:37,410
Open your eyes, Aoshi.

920
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:42,010
What you need is not battle.

921
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:46,010
Calm your heart.

922
01:53:46,650 --> 01:53:48,520
The Shogunate lives!

923
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:34,900
If you have abandoned
your honor as a Watcher

924
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:38,800
to tread the path of blood and carnage...

925
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:56,250
I will crush you!

926
01:55:41,330 --> 01:55:42,630
Burn!

927
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:52,710
No! No!

928
01:55:53,710 --> 01:55:54,980
Don't kill!

929
01:55:55,610 --> 01:55:56,980
Don't kill.

930
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:03,820
Are you okay?

931
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:27,580
Fire! Put it out!

932
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:35,090
We'll take over here.

933
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:36,820
Please.

934
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:43,430
Hold still.

935
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,180
Shishio!

936
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:24,870
Decoys.

937
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:18,530
Kenshin!

938
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:20,690
Where are you?

939
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:26,530
Wait for me!

940
01:58:37,180 --> 01:58:40,210
Give me a fight, damn it!

941
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,220
Misao!

942
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:45,490
What?

943
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:47,890
It's Elder and Aoshi!

944
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:50,220
Aoshi's come back?

945
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:23,420
Where's Battosai?

946
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,100
That again?

947
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:12,540
Aoshi!

948
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:13,810
Stay back!

949
02:00:34,830 --> 02:00:36,330
Damn you, Aoshi.

950
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,510
Is that how low

951
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:47,680
you've sunk?

952
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:30,650
I am not the Aoshi you once knew.

953
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:29,480
Hey!

954
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:34,590
All you underlings, get outta here!

955
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:46,430
Sanosuke?

956
02:02:47,130 --> 02:02:48,270
Why are you here?

957
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:53,110
"Why?"

958
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:57,280
To help you out, stupid!

959
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,290
Thank you.

960
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:12,960
All right, then.

961
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,300
Victory is ours!

962
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:17,360
Who are they?

963
02:03:19,170 --> 02:03:20,470
Get them all!

964
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:24,110
Himura!

965
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:25,410
You again?

966
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:27,470
Something's wrong here.

967
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:28,970
Yes.

968
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,980
Where's Shishio and his Ten Swords?

969
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:34,820
Why are you two looking so down?

970
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:37,820
It's all been too easy.

971
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:44,830
If he meant to burn Kyoto,
he'd be here to see it himself.

972
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:11,520
Miss Kaoru Kamiya?

973
02:04:12,990 --> 02:04:14,020
Who are you?

974
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:20,200
You mean Shishio's got
something else up his sleeve?

975
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,700
At the Battle of Toba-Fushimi,
when the Shogun and the Emperor

976
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,040
battled for rule over the land,

977
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:37,380
Shogun Yoshinobu abandoned
his forces and fled by ship to Edo.

978
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:47,560
Without that, the new government
never would have won.

979
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:49,890
History changed course.

980
02:04:50,030 --> 02:04:55,400
If he can rewrite history,
he'll terrify the government.

981
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:57,570
By spitting in their eye?

982
02:04:57,830 --> 02:05:00,570
Burning Kyoto is a first step.

983
02:05:01,370 --> 02:05:03,740
If he wants to retrace history...

984
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:06,910
Just maybe...

985
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:11,750
I'm going to bombard Tokyo

986
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:19,920
and destroy the country!

987
02:05:23,230 --> 02:05:25,430
His real aim is Tokyo!

988
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:27,360
Kenshin!

989
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:38,280
Miss Kaoru!

990
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:14,980
Where are you?

991
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:21,320
Where are you?

992
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:25,990
Where are you, Battosai?

993
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:29,990
Where?

994
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:33,830
Where?

995
02:06:35,470 --> 02:06:37,500
Battosai!

996
02:07:28,190 --> 02:07:29,190
Who are you?

997
02:07:40,530 --> 02:07:41,570
Stop!

998
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:52,580
Well done!

999
02:07:53,550 --> 02:07:56,420
You saw that Kyoto was just a feint.

1000
02:07:57,050 --> 02:07:58,590
Where's Miss Kaoru?

1001
02:07:58,790 --> 02:08:02,520
What, you mean you're only here
for a woman?

1002
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:05,090
Leave her out of this!

1003
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:07,090
Whatever.

1004
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:10,260
Miss Kaoru, you're on!

1005
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:15,500
Miss Kaoru!

1006
02:08:15,570 --> 02:08:19,540
Come on, Yumi! Untie the poor girl.

1007
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,770
Sure.

1008
02:08:21,810 --> 02:08:23,610
Have no fear! I will...

1009
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:27,110
Stop talking like a damn samurai!

1010
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:35,620
I want to see that killing spirit of yours.

1011
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:38,630
It's me you want. Let her go.

1012
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:42,460
This is the perfect chance

1013
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:47,970
to see once and for all who's the best.

1014
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:54,310
Kenshin!

1015
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:55,640
Hoji!

1016
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:58,010
I'll burn her!

1017
02:08:58,180 --> 02:08:59,210
No!

1018
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:03,420
It hurts when you burn.
So much you want to die.

1019
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:04,650
No.

1020
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:06,320
Yes!

1021
02:09:06,790 --> 02:09:09,490
It's that rage I want to see!

1022
02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:14,000
You want to kill me, right?

1023
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:15,300
Try it.

1024
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:16,400
Shut up.

1025
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:19,500
No! Don't let him tempt you!

1026
02:09:19,630 --> 02:09:23,170
Curse yourself, curse the gods.

1027
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:27,410
Curse Buddha, hate the times,
hate everything.

1028
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:28,480
No!

1029
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:30,780
Now you're looking good.

1030
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:39,860
Shishio!

1031
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:45,860
Kenshin!

1032
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:52,800
Miss Kaoru!

1033
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:55,570
Stay alive!

1034
02:10:02,180 --> 02:10:04,850
Watch, Battosai!

1035
02:10:18,890 --> 02:10:21,060
Is that all you got?

1036
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:23,900
Can't the legendary Battosai
do better than that?

1037
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:37,750
What?

1038
02:10:39,550 --> 02:10:43,090
The legend just wants
to play love-suicides?

1039
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:47,760
Miss Kaoru!

1040
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:49,930
Miss Kaoru!

1041
02:10:51,730 --> 02:10:53,100
Miss Kaoru!

1042
02:10:54,305 --> 02:11:54,923
