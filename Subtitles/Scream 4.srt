00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,189
<i>- Hello?
-  Hello.</ I></i>

4
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:17,899
<i>- Uh, yes?
- Who is this?</i>

5
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:21,320
<i>- Who are you calling?
-  Who am I speaking to? </ I></i>

6
00:00:21,424 --> 00:00:23,498
- Wrong number.
- Who was that?

7
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,939
- Oh, nobody.
- Did you pick a movie?

8
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:31,672
- Yeah, we re gonna go scary: Saw IV.
- Oh, I saw that in theaters. It sucks.

9
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:35,155
It's not scary, it's gross. I hate all that torture porn shit.

10
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:37,240
Why, angry feel.

11
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:43,849
- Well, I like Jigsaw. I think he kills people very creatively.
- But she don't give a shit who dies...

12
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:48,824
...cos there's no character to fill a man.
It's just body parts whipping and blood spewing.

13
00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:53,004
- Who you keep texting?
- I have a  Facebook stalker. He keeps leaving me messages.

14
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:58,187
- Nah, like what?
- Just stuff like: Hey, what's up? You are hot. I want to kill you...

15
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:02,919
- Well, delete him.
- I did it, but he hacked its way back in.

16
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:08,696
- Or report him.
- He is really hot, tho. You wanna see?

17
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:16,891
- That's Channing Tatum.
- It is not. Is it?

18
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:20,862
Yeah, from his Abercrombie days.
You were being punk'd.

19
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:30,340
<i>- Hello?
-  Who is this? </ I></i>

20
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:32,801
The more impatient version
of the person you just spoke to.

21
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:37,462
<i> I am sorry. You don't have to be a bitch about it. </ I>
- Of course I don't. Eat me.</i>

22
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:41,704
<i>-  You hang up on me and I cut thru your neck until I feel bone! </ I>
- Who is it?</i>

23
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,727
It's for you.

24
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,795
<i>- Hello?
-  Who is this? </ I></i>

25
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,425
<i>- It's Trudie. Who's this?
-  This is the last person you ever gonna see alive. </ I></i>

26
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:58,157
- It's a prank. Hang up.
- Why did you give the phone to me?

27
00:01:58,157 --> 00:02:01,504
- You are the one with a stalker.
- Are the doors locked?

28
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:02,859
Don't freak out.

29
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:10,272
Let it ring.

30
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:21,052
It's from stalker boy.
He said "Answer the phone".

31
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,223
For God's sake, it's a joke Trudie.
It's probably Lexie or Karen.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,425
- Where are you going?
- To make sure the front door is locked.

33
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,783
- No, don't open it.
- You're overreacting.

34
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:41,717
It's a joke, Trudie, ok? Someone made a
dummy profile. They re just trying to scare you.

35
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:43,594
Wait. Who is it?

36
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:50,288
I said, who is it?
Let's call the cops.

37
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:59,681
"I dare you to open the door."
No, Sherri, don't. No, don't, I'm scared.

38
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:04,029
It could be anyone that we know.
Lisa, Bailey, Wayne.

39
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:06,437
Or the hoped-for long shot, Channing Tatum.

40
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,528
There is nobody out here.

41
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,555
What is it say?

42
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:35,964
It says "I'm not outside,
I am right beside you. "

43
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:39,531
Trudie!

44
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,656
- Fucking kidding me?
- What?

45
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:08,045
That was so fucking stupid. Pure horse shit.
The death of horror right here in front of us!

46
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:13,050
- I jumped. It scared me.
- A fucking Facebook killer? You re kidding me right?

47
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:17,033
I guess now it would be Twitter. That'd make more sense.

48
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:23,424
Under articulate teens sit around and deconstruct horror movies
until Ghostface kills them one by one.

49
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:28,564
It's been done to death. The whole self-aware
post-modern meta-shit.

50
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:31,004
Stick a fork in 1996 already.

51
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:34,799
I like the Stab movies. They are scarier.

52
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:38,344
It's not aliens or zombies
or little Asian ghost girls.

53
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:44,433
There is something real about a guy
with a knife who just ... snaps.

54
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:51,751
- It can really happen.
- I can't do it. These people don't know when to stop.

55
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:54,109
They just keep recycling the same shit.

56
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,342
Even the opening scene, there is always some random girl
who gets a call that undoubtedly ends up getting her killed.

57
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:02,073
It's all so predictable.
There's no element of surprise.

58
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:04,117
You can see everything coming.

59
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:11,530
Did that surprise you?

60
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:19,642
- Why?
- Because you talk too much.

61
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,260
Now shut the fuck up
and watch the movie.

62
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,863
Oh my God. I love it.

63
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:37,168
I've seen it five times,
and it still gets me every time.

64
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:45,488
- You re kidding? I don't get it.
- Ok, it's like the Twilight Zone.

65
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,500
- Twilight zone...
- A movie within a movie.

66
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,314
I get that. But it's illogical..

67
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:54,153
It begs the question that if the beginning of Stab 7 is
Stab 6 then it's the beginning of Stab 6 Stab 5?

68
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,238
And if so, what is Stab 4 about?

69
00:05:56,238 --> 00:06:02,076
- You re over thinking it.- Am I or did you ever make it,
just under think it, there's a reason i don't watch these movies?

70
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:05,797
I can't believe you haven't seen them. We live in Woodsboro.

71
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:11,303
It has nothing to do with Woodsboro.
I thought you said Stab was based on true stories.

72
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,817
The first three, the original trilogy is based off of Sidney Prescott.

73
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:19,165
But then she threatened to sue em if they used
the true story so they just started making stuff up.

74
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:22,741
Stab 5 has time travel, which is by far the worst.

75
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:28,558
- And don't you have enough about this story every year?
- At least Woodsboro is known for something.

76
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:31,759
Did you hear that?

77
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,273
Uh, no, I didn't hear anything.

78
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:37,671
I did.

79
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,528
Jenny, don't try to scare me.

80
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:42,717
I am not trying to scare you.

81
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:43,927
You do it all the time.

82
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,219
No, I don't.

83
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:46,397
Where are you going?

84
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:48,170
I told you, I heard something.

85
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,848
I know you re trying to scare me.

86
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:51,756
I am not.

87
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,660
What is it?

88
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,517
I must have left the window in my room open.

89
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:11,097
- Could you get that? Marnie?
- Yeah.

90
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:19,000
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Who is this?</i>

91
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,430
Marnie. Who is this?

92
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,714
This is the last person you ever gonna see alive.

93
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:28,498
What?

94
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:36,630
- I am sorry. I had to.
- You bitch!

95
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:41,124
- So not funny.
- Somebody falls for it every year.

96
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:45,649
- I don't see why you get off on this shi.....
- Marnie?

97
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:54,688
Marnie? Marnie?!?

98
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:05,479
Good one, Marnie. Lights out, phone on the floor.

99
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,545
You know, you really should direct horror films.

100
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,808
Wherever you are...

101
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:20,159
Lemme guess. You want me to walk
by an open door frame so you can pop out, huh?

102
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:32,639
Ok. Timing, timing is perfect. But you don't have the
app on your phone, so you can't talk like Ghostface.

103
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,673
<i>- Can you?
- Yes, I can.</i>

104
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,115
<i>- Who is this?
- Not an app.</i>

105
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:43,076
<i>- Is this Trevor?
- Do I sound like a Trevor to you?</i>

106
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:47,987
Think of me as your director. You re in my movie.
You got a fun part so don't blow it.

107
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:52,720
<i>- What movie?
- Same one Marnie's in, only her part got cut way back.</i>

108
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,526
But you, you re dumb blond with the big tits.
We'll have some fun with you before you die.

109
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:03,949
I have a 4.0 GPA (Grade Point Average) and 135 IQ asshole.
What did you do with Marnie?

110
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:06,670
<i>- She's on the cutting room floor.
-That's not funny.</i>

111
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,319
This isn't a comedy, it's a horror film. People live, people die.

112
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:12,405
And you'd better start running.

113
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:18,013
Marnie?

114
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:40,643
- What do you think?
- Well, I guess today's the anniversary.

115
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:44,010
- Kids...
- No, I meant the display.

116
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:54,103
- It's good.
- Told the owner I'd kill his cat if you didn't get a ring.

117
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:56,751
Nice...

118
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:44,023
- Woah, 25 to stay alive!
- Shit! Sorry Sheriff!

119
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:47,224
Kirby...

120
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,711
Ehi, before you get in the car, you
have to promise not to kill me.

121
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:08,932
Why? What did you do?

122
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:10,673
Trevor called me last night.

123
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:12,309
Why is he calling you?

124
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,958
Because you won't take his calls, he knows
I have your ear and he wants to know.

125
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:19,159
- Know what?
- How upset you are.

126
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,881
- Can we just not talk about this?
- Fine, fine.

127
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:25,560
So, Trevor called me last night.

128
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,584
He called you too?

129
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:31,723
He's afraid your cousin coming to Woodsboro is distracting you from knowing how sorry he really is.

130
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,924
- Well, that's inventive.
- God...

131
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,919
Oh, by the way, have you seen the Grim Reaper? Angel of Death?

132
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,317
What are you talking about?

133
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:50,125
Your cousin. Last stop in a book tour, first stop in a road to a new life.

134
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:54,128
It's very dramatic. She's the reason why I love horror movies.

135
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:58,789
I'm sure she'd love to hear that. If I knew her which, I don't really.

136
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:03,657
Well, wherever she went, peple died. Other people. It was never her.

137
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:07,306
I mean, Stab is the wrong franchise for her, it should be Final Destination.

138
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,914
- And why is Jenny Randall calling me?

139
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:11,728
- I cannot stand Jenny Randall...
- Hello?

140
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:13,959
<i>- Oh, Jill...
- Why?</i>

141
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,044
- Shh...Jenny, is this you?

142
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,349
<i>What's your favorite scary movie?</i>

143
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:22,237
- Ok, who is this?
- What does she want?

144
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:27,554
<i>- I said, who is this?
- I asked you a question.</i>

145
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:30,338
<i>What's your favorite scary movie?</i>

146
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:32,288
I'm hanging up.

147
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,605
Wow, that was original.

148
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,180
I got a call like that this morning from Marnie the Carnie.

149
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,547
- What?
- Watch out!

150
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:46,655
<i>- Nice proof asshole!
- Ok...</i>

151
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:51,139
- You should really stop at sign.
- Sorry...

152
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:55,423
Angel of Death.

153
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:05,296
- Mayor wants these down before lunch.
- Only 25 more to go.

154
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:12,742
- Morning Sheriff.
- Morning Deputy. Joe.

155
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,003
Morning Sheriff.

156
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,559
- Looks like the celebration's begun.
- High School kids probably.

157
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,178
Yeah. One generation's tragedy is the next one's joke.

158
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:25,065
Sorry you can never get away from this.

159
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:30,944
You know, I wish I had been old enough to be
part of the Forest when you were solving those crimes.

160
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:35,919
It's those intense investigations that really bond relationships.

161
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:40,683
- Yeah.
- How's Gale by the way?

162
00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:45,061
Gale's good. She's writing...fiction.

163
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,410
Hey I made some lemon squares, they're in my car.

164
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:53,174
Thanks Deputy, but no, thanks.

165
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:57,208
Sheriff, you're not cheating on your wife if you eat my lemon square.

166
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,337
Yeah, but I would be cheating on the diet.

167
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:03,819
<i>Sheriff Riley! Come in! Sheriff Riley!</i>

168
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:05,622
This is Sheriff Riley, go ahead.

169
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:09,834
You gotta get over to the Randall house right
away. It's bad Sheriff, real bad.

170
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,746
<i>The book is "Out of Darkness" and its author Sidney Prescott is here with us today.</i>

171
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:33,387
<i>Have the 7 Stab movies all based on Gale Weathers'
books about you made it even harder to go on?</i>

172
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:40,519
<i>I don't blame Gale, that's in the past. Now if I was
a victim for too long, it was up to me to reinvent myself.</i>

173
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:47,368
<i>- That's why I wrote this book.
- Sidney Prescott, everybody. And rave reviews for her book, "Out of Darkness".</i>

174
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:51,966
Allright Gale, let's do it. Let's reinvent myself.

175
00:16:54,021 --> 00:17:03,613
Except, I have no fucking idea what to write!

176
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:17,636
- How's that new?
- That's the 2.0 upgrade version. I am totally mobile, man.

177
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:18,887
Nice.

178
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:26,852
Ouh, this is Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer, here with
the luscious Olivia "Don't look at my tits, I have a mind" Morris.

179
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:31,512
Here is my Woodsboro masquerade anniversary
question: What is your favorite scary movie?

180
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:34,129
Is that all you got? Some stupid douche question?

181
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:35,725
Yeah, where did you hear that anyway?

182
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:38,895
It's a line from Stab 1. Hey Charlie.

183
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:43,273
- You re a genre nut Kirby, what's your favorite scary movie?
- Bambi.

184
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:45,671
- Dork.
- What?

185
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:47,443
That's...funny, Kirby.

186
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:53,084
- Completely unaware you exist.
- No, man, she wants me.

187
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,953
Yeah, I wish, right? Asshole.

188
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:05,648
- I think Charlie likes you.
- And I like him. To tease, to torment, to make him squirm.

189
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,014
You could do a lot worse, trust me.

190
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:13,852
Oh, hi Trevor. Bye Trevor.

191
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:20,286
Can we talk? Somebody cares about you over here you know?

192
00:18:20,286 --> 00:18:22,371
Someone who made you really happy once.

193
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,165
Someone who never should have let you go.

194
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:29,232
When you re done with a phone call, you let someone go...

195
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:32,328
When you take someone to the airport, you let them go...

196
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:37,333
When you tell someone you love her, and she gives you
everything, and then you go out with someone else...

197
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:41,795
that is not letting her go, that is dumping her. Ok? That's betrayal.

198
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:49,239
Trevor Sheldon denied live on Hall Pass with
Robbie Mercer. What is your favorite scary movie, man?

199
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:50,521
I'll show you.

200
00:18:57,758 --> 00:19:05,170
Now I began to believe myself that that was all I
was, a victim. And that was unacceptable to me...

201
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:13,479
So, I sat down and began to write a new role that would be my own.

202
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:18,287
A role for a woman who could leave the walls
of fear behind and step out into the sunlight.

203
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,028
Out of Darkness.

204
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:28,889
<i>- Thank you.
- Ok, we re gonna start the book signing in a sec, so buy your copies while they last.</i>

205
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,654
<i>- May you ladies.
- New York Times best seller. Rave reviews...</i>

206
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:38,324
- Gale...I am glad you came.
- Congratulations, Sidney.

207
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:41,901
- I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but...
- Well, you can get one.

208
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:51,086
- Dewey! Ehi!
- Hey, Sidney. Gale, you made it.

209
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:52,515
What's going on Dewey?

210
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:56,341
Hey, Sid, I am sorry. I gotta do
something...I am really sorry.

211
00:19:56,341 --> 00:20:02,045
Excuse me. This will only take a minute. I need
you all to stay where you are and remain silent.

212
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:04,338
Nobody leaves, you heard the Sheriff, thanks you.

213
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:08,551
- Can't this wait 45, I am running an event here.
- M'am this is a police event now.

214
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:12,762
- What's going on?
- Gale, this is police  business. If you could just let us handle this.

215
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,774
I am talking to my husband, Deputy Judy.

216
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:19,132
Listen. There's a phone we believe may have
been taken from the scene of a crime.

217
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:22,605
Deputy Hicks has traced its location
back to these coordinates.

218
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,296
- The rest is "need to know".
- And I am not "need to know"?

219
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:27,161
Shhhh.

220
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:32,760
Sheriff! Ringing out here!

221
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:37,670
There.

222
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:46,127
- It's coming from the trunk
- Yeah.

223
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,733
- Dewey...
- They need everyone to stay back.

224
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:50,787
- Not now, Sid.
- It's my rental.

225
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:04,007
- Damn. - It's now official crime scene. Let's lock it down.

226
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:06,332
- Crime scene. - Detach him right out of here. Everybody back.
- Give me that camera. - Stand back.

227
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,916
- Give me that camera.
- Stand back.

228
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:13,046
- Please tell me this is a prank, Dewey.
- I am afraid not, Sid. Come on.

229
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:16,560
<i>- Amber, you re not gonna believe this...</i>

230
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,729
- Stand back, Gale. Gale.
- Just wanna see.

231
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:27,831
Ok, essays are due Tuesday, "Why Woodsboro is the best..."

232
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:32,042
Anything with an on-off swith should be off, that's the rule.

233
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,066
Somebody wanna share?

234
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:38,267
Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper were murdered last night. - What?

235
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:41,092
- What? - Stabbed to death.

236
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,626
- What's your favorite scary movie? - Shut up!

237
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:47,943
Y'all Tuesday, class is not hold then
- That was fast.

238
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:51,800
This week marks the anniversary of the infamous Woodsboro murders.

239
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:58,796
Two girls killed the exact day local celebrity victim
Sidney Prescott chose to return to her hometown.

240
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:02,967
<i>It could be something right out of a Gale Weathers' best seller. And where is she now?</i>

241
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:07,356
<i>Well, living right here in Woodsboro, cos
she's the wife of Sheriff Dewey Riley - Mrs Riley - Hoss.</i>

242
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:09,159
- First Lady.
- Perkins.

243
00:22:10,588 --> 00:22:12,674
Excuse me, Gale. He's conducting an interview.

244
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:16,677
- Great! I love interviews.
- You have to wait, Gale. Sorry, can't let you in there.

245
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:20,430
What are you gonna do? Arrest me, Deputy Judy?

246
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,446
If it comes to it. Civilian interference with a police
investigation poses many a problem in a court of law.

247
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:29,657
Ok. Listen to me Judy. I don't mind that
you re working with my hudband.

248
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:32,920
Or that you re even baking those little treats, as you do

249
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:37,623
But if you re gonna start acting like him, you
gotta put a mustache on, cos you sound ridiculous - Gale.

250
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,395
- Judy.
- Gale!

251
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:44,504
Deputy. Gale. Calm please.

252
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,207
- Uh, Sidney, if you don't mind giving us a minute.
- Sid. - Hi, Gale.

253
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:55,013
Dewey, would you please explain to Betty Crocker
that I have every right to be here?

254
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,797
If there's been another murder in Woodsboro obviusly....

255
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:03,500
- That is not public information.
- It is all over the Internet, Dewey.

256
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,369
- It is?
- Yes, the whole world knows about it before me.

257
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,840
She wants to be a part of the investigation, Sheriff.

258
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:17,941
Ok. Hang on. Uhm, are you familiar with the phrase "I wrote a book on this" ?

259
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:27,752
- Gale, with all due respect, I don't see how that pertains to...
- Because I wrote the book on this.

260
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:33,809
"The Woodsboro murders" by Gale Weathers.
- But you re not a reporter anymore, Gale.

261
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:34,956
- Woh, woh,woh..
- And even if you were...

262
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,667
Woh. Don't treat me like I'm the media.

263
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:43,964
I helped solve these things. 3 times, remember?
You and me, together.

264
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:48,447
<i>- But I am the Sheriff now, Gale.
- Right?</i>

265
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,119
- What, you re not gonna help you with this?
- I can't.

266
00:23:56,277 --> 00:24:02,575
Allright then, I am going rogue. This is what
I am good at, Dewey. This is what I know how to do.

267
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:10,749
Your lemon squares taste like ass.

268
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:17,151
- They don't. They really don't.
- Thank you, Sir.

269
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:18,475
- Sheriff. - Yeah? - We got a couple high school kids in here.

270
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:21,050
We got a couple high school kids in here.

271
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,532
Two of em, they say they got threatening phone
calls this morning from the victims' phones.

272
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:32,529
- Names are Olivia Morris and Jill Roberts.
- That's Sid's cousin. Damn.

273
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,938
- Right in here, Sheriff. - Hey, Jill.

274
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:38,722
- Sidney. Hi.
- Hi.

275
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:42,194
It's nice to see you, even under the circumstances.

276
00:24:42,924 --> 00:24:44,560
- You ok? - Yeah.

277
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:49,743
- So two of you got phone calls?
- Yeah, us two. "What's your favorite scary movie?".

278
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:55,561
It was the killer's voice. From Stab.
From, I mean you know, from your life.

279
00:24:56,249 --> 00:24:58,448
I am Kirby, by the way. I am their friend.

280
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:02,305
- And the killer didn't call you?
- No.

281
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:07,623
This is..this is a bad thing? Does that mean
that I am not gonna live as long as these two?

282
00:25:07,623 --> 00:25:14,025
No...Maybe. Of course not. Just...just be careful.

283
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:19,071
- Oh my God, did you hear that? I am gonna be next!
- Dewey, I shouldn't be here. I should leave town.

284
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:21,438
I am afraid that's not really possible, Sidney.

285
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:26,515
Look, nobody thinks you re involved but
everyone's a suspect. I am sorry.

286
00:25:26,515 --> 00:25:31,281
And there was evidence in your car connecting
the killer to you. You may be a material witness.

287
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:39,256
- So, you know, you ll have 24 hour police surveillance.
- That's comforting.

288
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:50,840
It's Rebecca. Oh my fucking God, Henry.
Yes! Its true. Two girls butchered. Pay day.

289
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:58,492
I was so not feeling Woodsboro. Was like lame
PR, am I right? Well, fuck me wow! Best idea ever.

290
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:00,577
Henry, I ll call you back.

291
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:07,949
Excuse me. I have to geek out. I hadn't got a chance to
say something earlier, but it's suck an honor to meet you.

292
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:09,690
- Thank you. - Rebecca Walters.

293
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,308
- Hi.
- When I was a kid it was all about top story with Gale Weathers.

294
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:16,748
- You were my 90s!
- Well, it's Gale Riley now.

295
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:20,127
You gave it all for love, I know that. How
long have you and Dewey been married?

296
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:24,130
- Ten years.
- Oh, just like your characters in Stab 3. Wow!

297
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,516
Wow...

298
00:26:26,872 --> 00:26:30,385
I didn't mean "bad wow", it's just, it always seemed
like more of a horror movie romance than a real one

299
00:26:30,385 --> 00:26:32,857
because it was a movie, and in real life it should never be.

300
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:38,289
Uh, dug a hole. Climbing out, here. So anyway,

301
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:43,335
Kudos on being brave enough to drop off the professional map.
Any plans on revitalizing your tarnished brand

302
00:26:44,544 --> 00:26:49,486
Listen, in about 2 seconds I am gonna revitalize
your face... with my tarnished brand.

303
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:51,645
I still got it.

304
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:54,876
Uhm, tasty.

305
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:08,587
She's so pretty. When you think about what
she survived. She must have scars everywhere.

306
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:10,359
Shhhh, Come on.

307
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:17,074
Her mom is my sister. I have scars too.
None ever asks me about my scars.

308
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,808
- I am sorry Mrs Roberts.
- She means  nice scars, mom.

309
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:25,185
Oh, well. Fine.

310
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:36,383
- How are you? How's Gale?
- I am alright. But Gale,

311
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:45,046
it's been hard on her. Small town. Small town husband. Not much to write about.

312
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:55,348
- You two ok?
- Well, i read somewhere once "Just when you think things can't get any worse,

313
00:27:56,109 --> 00:28:03,939
sometimes they don't...Sometimes, they get better.", Out of Darkness by Sidney Prescott, page 220.

314
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:14,616
Gotta get going.

315
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:26,762
- It's nice to see you, Dewey. Been thru a lot together.
- We ll get thru this too, ok?

316
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:28,701
I ll go.

317
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,775
Be good. It's ok. Relax, relax. It's just me.

318
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:57,654
- What the hell are you doing here? There are cops right out front.
- No match for the ninja, baby.

319
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:06,037
Anyway, what are you doing in the house of Sidney
Prescott? I mean, that's like being on Top Chef with Jeffrey Dahmer.

320
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:12,022
Can you please get away from the window?
You've no right to be in here. Not anymore.

321
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:17,861
Hang on. I heard you got a phone call from the killer. Is that true?

322
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:23,083
- And you care?
- Don't you think it'd be a lot safer with me around?

323
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:29,756
- I don't trust you, Trevor.
- Hey. I am just gonna have to make sure that you do. Alright?

324
00:29:33,165 --> 00:29:37,452
Oh, sorry, I didn't...
- No, he's just leaving. Its...it's my ex.

325
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:41,100
- Oh. - Yeah, the one and only.

326
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:43,227
- Hi.
- Hi.

327
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:49,796
It's cool to meet you...officially. I keep meaning to
pick up a copy of your book, but...

328
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,246
You re smaller in person.

329
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:07,572
- What?
- Nothing, you just, ehm, you remind me of me.

330
00:30:10,147 --> 00:30:13,378
- Lock your window, ok?
- Yeah, goodnight.

331
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:14,776
Night.

332
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:24,347
- Sorry about that. Just making my rounds before taking off.
- Great, thanks.

333
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:30,739
- You don't remember me, do you?
- Sorry?

334
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:34,533
We went to High School together. Judy Hicks?

335
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:43,094
We had the same Homeroom in. Drama club too.
We were in Peter Pan together. I played a Lost Boy.

336
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:51,966
- You were... Tiger Lily.
- I am sorry, it was a long time ago.

337
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:59,692
It's ok, ehm. You had a lot of stuff going on back then.

338
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:04,561
Well, it's nice to see you again, Judy.
- You too.

339
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:15,101
<i>- Everything ok upstairs?
- You re supposed to be out front, Perkins.</i>

340
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:30,480
- 4 letter word for...courage?
- Uh, guts.

341
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:43,347
- It's Olivia Morris, she lives next door. She's on the list.
- She can live next door to me.

342
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:51,978
<i>Now seriously, ehm, Mary I am warning you, ok? I am
gonna have to get physical. I mean it. This is it! Just fuck off!</i>

343
00:32:03,145 --> 00:32:05,440
- Hello?
- What are you guys up to?

344
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:10,589
Uhm, we re watching Shaun of the Dead.
- You know there's two zombies sitting outside your house in a car?

345
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:14,759
- Yeah, they are cops. You wanna come up?
- Angel of Death leave?

346
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:19,566
- No, she's in the guest room.
- Forget it. Next door is close enough.

347
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:25,374
- Your mom home?
- She's at her boyfriend's. It's creepier in here tonight.

348
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:31,077
No, the zombies are still in their
car, so you should be alright.

349
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:33,162
- Call me tomorrow, ok?
- Right.

350
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:36,988
- She wanna come up?
- She fears the Reaper.

351
00:32:37,342 --> 00:32:38,416
Watch this.

352
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:53,127
- Who's speaking?
- What's your favorite scary movie, Olivia?

353
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:58,216
It's the worst imitation I've ever heard, Jill. Speaking of
Stab, you heard where the Stab- a- thon's gonna be at?

354
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,833
No. It doesn't matter to me anyways, mom doesn't let me go.

355
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:08,924
- It's Trevor, I'll handle this.
- Trevor is calling...again.

356
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,719
<i>-What do you want?
- I wanna talk to Jill.</i>

357
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:18,181
Uhm, no it's Kirby. Sorry, Trevor, Jill is
screening her calls from all past relationships.

358
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:21,591
-What's going on over there?
- Hang on one sec. What is he saying?

359
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:27,086
<i>- I am not Trevor.
- W-What? I can barely hear you, Trevor.</i>

360
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:32,831
<i>- This isn't Trevor.
- Oh, oh, alright. Then why do you have his phone?</i>

361
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:38,148
- Whoever this is. He's trying to do Ghostface.
- He's being weird.

362
00:33:38,877 --> 00:33:43,058
- I wanna talk to Jill.
- Ok, well, she doesn't want to talk to you.

363
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:48,241
Come on, Mr Ghostface, whisper to me.
Aren't you supposed to ask me a question?

364
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:52,901
<i>- Alright. How's the movie?
- What movie?</i>

365
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:57,801
<i>- Shaun of the Dead.
- How did you know that?</i>

366
00:33:58,364 --> 00:34:03,128
<i>- Because I'm standing in the closet.
- Stop, you're not.</i>

367
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:05,767
- What's going on?
- Trevor is being weird.

368
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:07,820
- I mean, if it is him, I dunno.
- What?

369
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:11,793
<i>- This is not fucking Trevor!
- Well, then who the fuck are you?</i>

370
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:19,268
<i>- Open the closet door.
- You do know there are cops all over this house?</i>

371
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:22,261
<i>I think that I have just enough time to slice someone open.</i>

372
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:26,088
- I'll talk to him.
- Shhhhhh.

373
00:34:27,578 --> 00:34:28,975
- What's going on over there, you guys? -

374
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:30,257
- S-Sorry, I dunno. Kirby? -Shhhhhh.

375
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:33,396
S-Sorry, I-I dunno. Kirby?
- Shhhh.

376
00:34:33,396 --> 00:34:35,930
<i>- Kirby.
- Come on, do it.</i>

377
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:40,318
<i>- There is no way you re in there.
- See for yourself.</i>

378
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:46,825
Kirby? Kirby, come on, talk to me.
This isn't funny! Kirby!

379
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,169
<i>- Liar. I am over this.
- I never said I was in your closet.</i>

380
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:05,956
Oh my God!

381
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,146
- Olivia! - Oh my God!

382
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:10,618
Help, in my house!

383
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:16,633
No!

384
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,143
No. No!

385
00:35:38,695 --> 00:35:40,571
<i>- Hoss!
- Olivia!</i>

386
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:41,540
Perkins!

387
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,428
Shit.

388
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:44,650
<i>- What?
- Welcome home Sidney. Preview of coming events.</i>

389
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:49,801
<i>- Why don't you come for me? You got the balls for that?
- Oh, poor Sidney. You think this is all about you?</i>

390
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:53,481
<i>- You think you're still the star.
- This isn't a fucking movie!</i>

391
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:55,222
<i>- It will be. - These are innocent people.</i>

392
00:36:55,222 --> 00:37:01,175
<i>Spare me the lecture! You've done very well by all this
blood shed, haven't you? How about the town you left behind?</i>

393
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:08,025
<i>I ve got plans for you. I am gonna slit your eyelids in
half so you don't blink when I stab you in the face.</i>

394
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:15,574
<i>You'll die when I want you to, Sidney. Not
a moment before. Until then, you re going to suffer.</i>

395
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:20,443
- Sidney!
- Jill? Stay right there.

396
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:23,226
- Is she...
- Do not look, ok?

397
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:27,887
- She said you were the Angel of Death.
- Look out!

398
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:52,483
- Come look. Look over there.
- He's in here.

399
00:37:53,181 --> 00:37:58,571
- Where is he?
- He was...

400
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:02,188
<i>- What's your status?
- Jill?</i>

401
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:04,629
- Don't.

402
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:16,661
What happened? Oh my God, Jill.

403
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:24,532
Jesus. Your hon, 'Vis. Baby, baby. Come here.
Come on, let's go, let's go. Let's get care of you, right?

404
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,641
- Jill? Oh my God. Are you ok?
- Give me a hand.

405
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,007
- Keep your pressure on it.
- There's somebody back there.

406
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,344
- Call it in.
- Right.

407
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:41,892
- Hey, are you ok?
- You should look upstairs.

408
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:55,842
<i>Let's get the corners and rub around these.</i>

409
00:39:01,263 --> 00:39:02,587
<i>Thought this was over!</i>

410
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:07,634
<i>It's all your fault, Sidney.</i>

411
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:09,927
<i>Just like her mother!</i>

412
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,444
I am sorry of what I said.

413
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:23,075
- Shouldn't you get that looked at?
- Yeah.

414
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:30,800
- What the hell happened?
- Ok, I saw him going to that yard, two houses down, right before.

415
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,209
- A-A-And I circled around to cut him off.
- And?

416
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:39,913
- And I met Hoss coming from the other direction.
- No, he must have circled back around somehow. He's like a ghost.

417
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:43,604
- Chief, we're sorry.
- We feel terrible.

418
00:39:44,886 --> 00:39:46,971
Alright. Get outta here.

419
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:04,539
This is Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer
webcasting live in our darkest hour.

420
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:08,157
What began as a day of remembrance,
has ended with a serial murder.

421
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:13,870
Olivia Morris, who officially would never go out
with me, is dead. So is Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper.

422
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:18,010
Our local legacy, the Stab movies, is coming to life.

423
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,953
- Excuse me, are you recording with that thing?
- My video blog upload. He's webcasting right now.

424
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:28,373
- Mind turning it off? A little old school, off the record?
- Can't. Owe it to my audience.

425
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:31,125
- Turn the fucking thing off.
- Ok...

426
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:37,351
- So, you two are the boys who run the
movie club at Woodsboro High, huh?

427
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:41,521
- Oh, Charlie rents it. I'm just VP, in case he takes a bullet.
- It's called Cinema Club.

428
00:40:42,146 --> 00:40:48,100
- So you must have a very unique insight into the movie buffs at your school?
- Maybe.

429
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:52,478
What if we could catch the killer, by working together?

430
00:40:52,478 --> 00:40:57,911
Two generations of cutting edge journalists
intertwining our passions for media.

431
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:01,800
- What would you say?
- I love you?

432
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:10,088
Very good. Now, you give me your expertise on the gore geek
scene at Woodsboro High and maybe I give you something in return

433
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:18,440
- Say, a celebrity visit to your Cinema Club...by me?
- What about Sidney?

434
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:22,642
- What about Sidney?
- Hey, you know her, right? I am you're friends with her?

435
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:29,877
No offense but, that'd be a big deal for some of the club.
A visit from Sidney Prescott, I mean, she's the star.

436
00:41:29,877 --> 00:41:34,058
Uh, yes she's Daniel Radcliffe to my J.K. Rowling.

437
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:38,051
- When was the bookshelf in the box office? - Never.

438
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:46,131
- There's no broken bones. I think you'll be
fine. Maybe just take a couple weeks off.

439
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:56,494
So, Sidney...Uh, ouh. Anyway, long story short
, Random wants to lock you into 3 more books, now.

440
00:41:56,807 --> 00:42:00,457
See the blank line in your contract? You can name your phrase.

441
00:42:00,457 --> 00:42:03,939
And as soon as you re clear in this investigation,
we re on the next plane to New York.

442
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:09,225
- I booked Today, The View, Nancy Grace, MTV News.
- Excuse me, can I...can I ask you a question?

443
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:15,001
- Did you read my book?
- Thought I'd wait for the movie.

444
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:26,616
- Book tour is over. - Sidney. Accept your situation.
You re a victim, for life. So, embrace it, use it.

445
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:32,016
I know you care about your readers. All those little
down-trodden fucks that just need a light at the end of their

446
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:38,199
tunnels so they don't jump off a bridge. And a lucky break
like this? I am talking a 100 percent increase in sales, minimum.

447
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:43,454
That's maybe a million more people getting your
message and you get a ton more checks. Win-win.

448
00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:48,365
- I won't be needing you anymore.
- Sidney!

449
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,481
- You re fired.
- Fired?

450
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:53,577
- Fired!
- Fine.

451
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:18,110
"What do you think about my book, Rebecca?"

452
00:43:31,602 --> 00:43:36,157
The problem of Sidney is she never gets laid.
Or even a little shit faced once in a while.

453
00:43:37,585 --> 00:43:41,037
She'll call me at 9 to apologize. Just watch.

454
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:55,019
She'll come around. Gotta just give her
time. Sidney will come....around.

455
00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:09,938
<i>- This is Rebecca.
- Sidney Prescott, please. </i>

456
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,764
I am handling Ms Prescott's calls and appearances.
May I take a message?

457
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:23,096
<i>You are the message. Are you writing this down?
- Yes, I am.</i>

458
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:27,966
But, it's kinda hard to hear you. I'm in a hospital,
with Sidney. If you can just hang on one second.

459
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,958
<i>I've got time. It's you that doesn't.</i>

460
00:44:39,716 --> 00:44:43,302
<i>You know, Rebecca, it doesn't
sound to me like you re in the hospital.</i>

461
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:50,537
<i>Sounds like you re in a parking garage.
A dark and deserted parking garage.</i>

462
00:44:52,102 --> 00:44:57,221
<i>But if you wanna be in the hospital, I'd be
happy to put you there. In the morgue!</i>

463
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,736
Help! Help! Save me!

464
00:46:03,384 --> 00:46:06,243
Cut and run, you fucking bastard.

465
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:21,487
This is an ongoing investigation.
But rest assured, we re pursuing a number of leads.

466
00:47:21,487 --> 00:47:23,822
-Sheriff
- The less I say about that, the better.

467
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:26,668
So, I'm taking questions.

468
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,588
- Dewey!
- Gale?

469
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:35,333
Any comment on the fact that these killings seem to
resemble the pattern of the original Woodsboro murders?

470
00:47:35,615 --> 00:47:37,491
Hun? Later!

471
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:39,545
<i>What was that, Sheriff?</i>

472
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:43,746
As I was saying...my officers are hard at work.

473
00:47:43,746 --> 00:47:50,399
We just want the community to know that we re very
close to bringing this whole situation under control.

474
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,731
Hey, someone! Get up to the top
of the structure! Go! Go!

475
00:48:00,731 --> 00:48:03,650
<i>- Everyone back! Stay back!
- Back, nobody move!</i>

476
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,776
Jenkins, I want a man on this stairwell.

477
00:48:08,237 --> 00:48:10,782
<i>- You see anybody?
- Nobody out there.</i>

478
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:12,836
There's nobody out there, Sheriff!

479
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,060
- It's all under control huh, Sheriff?
- But what am I supposed to say?

480
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,554
Listen, I may not be wearing a uniform,
but I happen to have a lead and you don't.

481
00:48:25,222 --> 00:48:27,588
So let me know when you re back on Team Gale.

482
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,133
Move back, I am the Sheriff.

483
00:48:41,643 --> 00:48:47,210
Ok, Cinema Club, we re not in session.
Welcome. I'll tell you a little bit about ourselves.

484
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:54,196
We re a sanctioned after school activity, one
rung below the Glee club, two above Nintendo Wii Fit

485
00:48:54,196 --> 00:48:59,795
and let me just say to our guest
, Sidney Prescott, it's an honor.

486
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:07,416
Beyond Jamie Lee Curtis, forget Linda Blair,
I mean, this is the ultimate.

487
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:14,725
Thanks, I-I guess. This, uhm...you film your entire
High School experience and what, post it on the net?

488
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:18,760
- Everybody will be doing it someday, Sid.
- It's kind of the one component the killer is missing.

489
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:25,756
- Wait, what do you mean?
- Well, if you wanna be the new "new version", the killer should be filming the murders.

490
00:49:25,756 --> 00:49:30,103
That's like the natural next step in the psycho
slasher innovation. I mean you film em all real time

491
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:34,659
- and then before you get caught, you upload em into cyberspace.
- Making your art as immortal as you.

492
00:49:35,702 --> 00:49:37,194
- Not to implicate him...
- Not to implicate me...

493
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:43,250
-So who do you think is behind the murders?
- Well, it's a Stab fanatic, clearly.

494
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:47,285
Working on less of a Screquel and more of a Screamake.
- Copyrighted terms, by the way.

495
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:50,934
Cos all there are now are remakes.
Only horror the studios green-light.

496
00:49:51,247 --> 00:49:55,908
I mean, there are still rules, but the rules have changed.
The unexpected is the new cliché.

497
00:49:55,908 --> 00:49:58,764
Yeah, you gotta have an opening sequence
that blows the doors off

498
00:49:58,764 --> 00:50:02,873
done with some flashy music video direction.
And the kills gotta be way more extreme.

499
00:50:02,873 --> 00:50:07,845
Modern audiences got savvy to the rules of the originals,
so the reversals become the new standard.

500
00:50:07,845 --> 00:50:13,308
In fact, the only surefire way to survive a modern
horror movie, you pretty much have to be gay.

501
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:22,661
So, why are you so sure that the killer is working by the rules of a horror remake?
- Well, the original Stab structure is pretty apparent.

502
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:27,708
- Two kids killed in a house while their parents are away.
- And then the school's "hot chick" savaged beyond recognition.

503
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:30,209
- We all know where it goes from there...
- A party.

504
00:50:30,877 --> 00:50:37,727
- Exactly. A party. Guaranteed third act main cast blood bath.
- Fingers crossed on some nudity for a change.

505
00:50:40,094 --> 00:50:44,890
- Ok, do you know of a party that's happening tonight?
- Well, there's Stab- a- thon.

506
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:51,990
- Stab- a- thon?
- Uh, It's a movie marathon. All 7 Stabs back to back. We do it every year.

507
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:59,090
- Is tonight? There's a killer out there patterning his murders after the original movie.
- I know, it's pretty wild.

508
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,414
We have to call it off.

509
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:05,732
- Uhm, ok, I mean, it's Friday. I am sure we re not
the only party that's going on at Woodsboro.

510
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:10,183
- But where is this circle-jerk gonna take place?
- So, let's ready for this Q&A.

511
00:51:10,183 --> 00:51:16,138
- No, no. I really want the location.
- You know, it's kind of an underground thing. Email invites. Pretty secret.

512
00:51:17,149 --> 00:51:23,331
What, you re not gonna tell me? Really?
We re working together. Remember?

513
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:27,856
- So you re ready for the Q&A?
- Fuck you. Let's go.

514
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,392
That was awesome.

515
00:51:34,017 --> 00:51:36,801
- Nobody comes to the house unless we say so.
- Got it.

516
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:38,886
I feel like I'm under house arrest.

517
00:51:54,265 --> 00:52:01,918
You know when people say "I know how you feel", but
you know they re just saying that because they really have no

518
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:08,246
freaking idea how you feel? I know how you feel.

519
00:52:12,177 --> 00:52:14,679
I am so sorry about Olivia.

520
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:21,467
I am sorry about your publicist.

521
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:33,436
How do you handle it, people staring at you all the time?
- People stare at me?

522
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:40,703
I could never handle that kind of attention.
I just feel like it would take over your whole life.

523
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:56,915
Uh, all I do is I...try not to think about me.
I have people I care about. I focus on them.

524
00:52:58,793 --> 00:53:01,962
And the rest, uhm, it works out.

525
00:53:04,255 --> 00:53:10,240
You saved my life last night. I mean, I know
we re family but... you heard a thing on me.

526
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:16,610
Makes me wonder, you know,
if I'd be brave enough to do the same thing.

527
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:21,198
I really hope you never have to find that out.

528
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:27,631
Oh, if you need me, you know where to find me.

529
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,217
I'll be up in my cell, oh, I mean, my room.

530
00:53:55,634 --> 00:54:01,412
Our rooms are boarded up. That's the
view from my cell. It's really weird.

531
00:54:01,975 --> 00:54:05,446
I think Olivia would understand, ok?
She'd want me to be around other people.

532
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:10,701
Holy shit. Even if I did just crash land on planet dork.

533
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:15,257
Speaking of which, Trevor's here.
- Hey, Kirby.

534
00:54:15,257 --> 00:54:20,021
-What is he doing there? That is so not his scene.
- I have no idea, maybe he thought you would be here.

535
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:25,142
Yeah, fat chance. After what happened last night?
I mean, my mum is just completely freaked out.

536
00:54:25,142 --> 00:54:29,801
-It's not prim.
- Alright, you go do your good girl thing and I'll drink for the both of us.

537
00:54:29,801 --> 00:54:33,210
- I will keep you posted.
- Alright, be safe.

538
00:55:17,428 --> 00:55:22,609
Stab-a-thon!
Stab-a-thon!

539
00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:26,614
- Thank you! Thank you. Gracias. Gracias.
- Shhhh.

540
00:55:27,938 --> 00:55:31,034
Cinema Club thanks you for coming up for our third annual Stab-a-thon.

541
00:55:31,034 --> 00:55:33,223
Thank you, number-3-thon. We thank you in rows.

542
00:55:33,223 --> 00:55:37,081
- Are you ready to drink every time someone can't get a cellphone signal?
- Yeah!

543
00:55:37,363 --> 00:55:43,274
- Are you ready to drink every time someone shuts the refrigerator
door and, oh my God, there's the harmless character right behind it?

544
00:55:43,274 --> 00:55:44,734
Yeah!

545
00:55:44,734 --> 00:55:48,738
-Are you ready to drink every time somebody screams the word....
- No!

546
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:51,834
Let's get the Stab-athon started!

547
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,298
<i>Ghostface!</i>

548
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,664
<i>Get out in 5!</i>

549
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:14,063
<i>Move your ass!</i>

550
00:56:14,657 --> 00:56:15,700
Screw you!

551
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:52,952
Yes!

552
00:56:59,979 --> 00:57:02,106
Uh, Yeah. Back on my game.

553
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:07,257
Perfect. New work in progress, chapter 1.

554
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:14,316
When I moved to Woodsboro, I never in a million
years dreamed that I would again play the critical role...

555
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:16,890
...in solving another series of these...

556
00:57:25,553 --> 00:57:26,702
What the hell?

557
00:57:50,254 --> 00:57:53,872
- Gale, where are you?
- I followed the kids to the Stab-a-thon.

558
00:57:54,154 --> 00:58:00,898
There's an old abandoned farm on 4th Dylan Road.
Listen, I-I got it under surveillance, but I think the killer is about to make his move.

559
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:07,373
- What makes you so sure?
- You do a remake to outdo the original, that's what the kids said.

560
00:58:07,373 --> 00:58:11,753
This party is all about the Stab movies.
Come on, how meta can you get?

561
00:58:12,243 --> 00:58:15,860
- How "what the.." can you get?
- I dunno, I heard em say it.

562
00:58:16,278 --> 00:58:22,637
- Dewey, listen to me, you have to get out here.
Come on, you catch the killer, I get the story. It's a win-win.

563
00:58:22,637 --> 00:58:27,474
- Well, I thought you were going rogue, Gale.
- Oh come..are you serious? C'mon!

564
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:34,502
- Forget it. Thanks for having faith in me! I gotta fix my equipment.
- Gale!

565
00:58:37,317 --> 00:58:38,328
Shit.

566
00:58:53,468 --> 00:59:00,421
Bravo, well...very well done, very, I'm very impressed.
Kind of. Kinda impressed. Not Really.

567
00:59:00,807 --> 00:59:02,611
- That'll do. - Yeah? - Yeah.

568
00:59:02,611 --> 00:59:04,977
- Yeah, she wants you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:59:07,793 --> 00:59:10,369
<i>Nooooooo!</i>

570
00:59:12,808 --> 00:59:13,642
<i>Ghostface.....</i>

571
00:59:22,785 --> 00:59:25,089
<i>- Hello?
- Hello.</i>

572
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:30,124
<i>- Who is this?
- Were you expecting somebody now?</i>

573
00:59:37,465 --> 00:59:40,947
<i>You know, I don't even know you...
- ...and I dislike you already.</i>

574
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:45,129
- Hicks, how far are you from 4th Dylan Road?
- 5 minutes at the most, Sir.

575
00:59:45,129 --> 00:59:45,890
Well, step on it.

576
00:59:48,287 --> 00:59:49,538
<i>Look out your window.</i>

577
01:00:35,008 --> 01:00:37,343
Gale! Gale, behind you!

578
01:00:49,655 --> 01:00:50,208
No!

579
01:00:54,212 --> 01:00:55,046
Gale!

580
01:01:10,602 --> 01:01:11,436
Freeze!

581
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:26,814
Get out of the way, you morons!

582
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:33,246
Dammit.

583
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,962
- Ok, put pressure on that.
- Did you catch him?

584
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:45,216
- No, hopefully your cameras got something.
- They weren't the only ones, Dewey.

585
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:48,480
- What?
- There's a webcam... set back there.

586
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,305
- He was watching me.
- A webcam?

587
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:54,328
- He's recording the murders.
- What?

588
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:58,228
This time... he's making the movie.

589
01:02:02,816 --> 01:02:07,028
This Sidney Prescott detail man, I don't like it.

590
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,874
The cops scouting the house, they always get it.

591
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,773
What are you talking about?
- It's a movie cop rule.

592
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:19,831
Sucks to be a cop in a movie. Unless you re Bruce Willis.
- Not all cops die in movies.

593
01:02:20,457 --> 01:02:24,002
No, but if it's your last day before retirement you do.

594
01:02:24,805 --> 01:02:27,588
If you re a rookie, some with a wife
who's pregnant, you do.

595
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:33,218
Or if your partner is better looking than you,
you do, and by the way, I win that one.

596
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:38,234
You know what, I'll take the next perimeter. I'll be right back.

597
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,393
Shit.

598
01:02:41,393 --> 01:02:46,480
- I know this one, you re not supposed to say that, are you?
- Eh, new decade, new rules.

599
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:52,600
You know, these days, you might come back, find me
dead. Eyes gouged out, tongue sticking out. Could go either way.

600
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,322
- I gotta learn this shit.
- Eh, I'll take this one.

601
01:02:58,752 --> 01:03:03,944
- Hey, Hoss. Be careful.
- I am always careful.

602
01:03:07,874 --> 01:03:09,542
Dead man walking.

603
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:07,220
- Perkins, was there a window open on your
last perimeter check? Perkins, come in. Over.

604
01:04:38,247 --> 01:04:38,737
Anthony?

605
01:04:41,033 --> 01:04:41,554
Perkins?

606
01:04:47,225 --> 01:04:51,093
- Dammit.
- You should have seen the look on your face, rookie.

607
01:04:53,418 --> 01:04:55,441
Hoss! What the fuck!

608
01:04:57,557 --> 01:04:58,599
Holy shit...

609
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:10,152
Hoss!

610
01:05:27,198 --> 01:05:28,345
Fuck Bruce Willis!

611
01:05:57,601 --> 01:06:02,992
- Sorry. The wind chimes were over here.
- It was me, I was trying to fix em, sorry.

612
01:06:04,879 --> 01:06:07,934
- I am just back the store.
- Were you shopping?

613
01:06:08,247 --> 01:06:12,385
A stress buster. I got one more bag
in the car. I'll be right back.

614
01:06:38,721 --> 01:06:40,118
Jill, you re gonna get that?

615
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:47,803
<i>- Roberts residence.
- You re a survivor, aren't you, Sidney?</i>

616
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:53,193
<i>Your one and only skill: You survive.
Well, I have one question for you.</i>

617
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:58,375
<i>What good did to be a survivor in this little drama if everyone close to you is dead?</i>

618
01:06:58,896 --> 01:07:01,888
<i>- Who are you?
- Turn on the TV to channel 6.</i>

619
01:07:01,888 --> 01:07:05,340
<i>- Who the fuck are you?
- Turn it on. Watch the teaser.</i>

620
01:07:07,247 --> 01:07:13,232
<i>...But it nearly turned deadly tonight, with the latest
victim of this attack being the wife of the Woodsboro Sheriff...</i>

621
01:07:13,232 --> 01:07:20,437
<i>...Gale Riley, AKA Gale Weathers, who's in serious condition
tonight after being stabbed. Her assailant then disappeared...</i>

622
01:07:20,437 --> 01:07:25,515
<i>in a sea of identic.... - Glad you came home, Sidney. Has it been worth it yet?</i>

623
01:07:25,515 --> 01:07:32,572
<i>- Why are you doing this?
- Ah, friends count, but it's the family ties that cut deep. Am I right?</i>

624
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:38,870
<i>- What do you mean?
- The ones you care about most. And what's closer than family?</i>

625
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,715
<i>- The bond of blood.
- Don't.</i>

626
01:07:41,205 --> 01:07:45,137
<i>You can't save them. All you can do is watch.</i>

627
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:47,357
Jill!

628
01:08:06,187 --> 01:08:07,917
- Kate!
- Sid?

629
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,940
- She's not in her room.
- Oh my God.

630
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,130
She's gone at Kirby's. You gotta call her, get her back here.
- Ok.

631
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,414
<i>- Come on, Jill!
- Leave a message.</i>

632
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:22,670
- She's not picking up. What's going on?
- The killer called, he's coming after me. But he wants my family first.

633
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,380
- Oh God, Jill...
- Let's get the cops.

634
01:08:25,141 --> 01:08:26,215
- The cops aren't there.
- What?

635
01:08:26,466 --> 01:08:29,697
They were there when I first came in, but they re not there now.
- Let's get to Kirby's.

636
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:35,025
Out the front.

637
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,013
Press up on the bottom. Can you?

638
01:08:52,447 --> 01:08:53,281
Let's get out of here.

639
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:57,316
Kate, come on! Kate!

640
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:13,602
- Tell Jill I am so sorry...
- No, no, no, no, shhhh...

641
01:09:25,008 --> 01:09:25,852
Kate...

642
01:09:42,575 --> 01:09:46,547
- Hicks. What are you doing?
- I just saw somebody coming around the side of the house.

643
01:09:46,651 --> 01:09:48,559
Where are Hoss and Perkins?
I couldn't get em on the radio.

644
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:55,483
- Whose blood is that?
- Is...Is Kate's, we were just attacked. She's dead.

645
01:09:55,588 --> 01:09:57,745
- Where is she?
- The front door.

646
01:09:58,235 --> 01:09:59,518
- Show me.
- Ok.

647
01:10:04,429 --> 01:10:05,440
- Stay here.
- Ok.

648
01:10:11,737 --> 01:10:17,191
This is Deputy Hicks. I've got a homicide at the
Roberts residence. No sign of Perkins or Hoss.

649
01:10:17,608 --> 01:10:20,151
- Copy that. We'll try to locate em.
- I'm so sorry.

650
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:38,377
You're gonna be fine, alright? I swear.
No more on your own. It's you and me, forever.

651
01:10:40,952 --> 01:10:41,681
Easy.

652
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:44,850
- Dewey.
- Yeah?

653
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:49,510
Promise me something.
- Anything.

654
01:10:50,722 --> 01:10:56,122
- Catch that motherfucker.
- Absolutely. I love you.

655
01:10:56,122 --> 01:10:57,029
I love you.

656
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:03,952
- It was chaos. Utter chaos.
- I can't believe that.

657
01:11:03,952 --> 01:11:08,372
The Sheriff's wife, man. She told us to cancel it
and we didn't and now this? What are we supposed to do?

658
01:11:08,372 --> 01:11:10,352
Robbie, calm down. It makes sense.

659
01:11:10,769 --> 01:11:13,450
- This is about the reboots too.
They-they-they one up the original ending.

660
01:11:13,762 --> 01:11:19,601
- "The Woodsboro murders" ended at a party, so in the remake...
- ...The party is the false ending. New rules.

661
01:11:19,883 --> 01:11:23,886
- Exactly.
- Ok, no offense guys but I'm gonna put in Stab 7.

662
01:11:23,886 --> 01:11:25,658
- Yes...
- Nobody cancels my film festival.

663
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:31,611
Wohaa, I don't wanna watch that. Not after what happened to Olivia.
- Oh, come on. It was her favorite.

664
01:11:31,611 --> 01:11:35,230
Oh, wow Kirby. You have some classics here.
- Yep.

665
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:41,069
"Suspiria","Don't look now"...
- You know it. I can trivia your ass under the table, cinema boy.

666
01:11:41,069 --> 01:11:45,312
Oh, yeah? Who played Leatherface first?
- Gunnar Hansen.

667
01:11:45,312 --> 01:11:48,199
Wow, did you feel that?

668
01:11:49,732 --> 01:11:54,498
- The charge that moved between us, then?
- Oh, that was me. I have powers.

669
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,103
So sexy...

670
01:11:57,177 --> 01:12:02,400
You guys are unbelievable. You re playing fucking trivia games?
The cops are gonna come for us, they are gonna shut down my website.

671
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,756
-We re so dead!
- Yeah. I agree.

672
01:12:04,756 --> 01:12:10,053
- Jesus Christ, where did you come from?
- The front door. By the way Kirby, with everything that's going on right now...

673
01:12:10,053 --> 01:12:14,223
...you probably shouldn't leave that unlocked.
- Sorry...

674
01:12:14,922 --> 01:12:20,552
- And...May I ask what the hell are you doing here?
- Why, didn't I find the after-party?

675
01:12:21,011 --> 01:12:26,891
- No, you found the Anti-party and it's invitation only.
- Yeah, well, I got an invitation. From Jill.

676
01:12:29,247 --> 01:12:33,115
So, what's the story?
- What?

677
01:12:33,709 --> 01:12:39,235
- You sent me a text message.After-party at
Kirby's house. I mean, it was from your phone.

678
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:47,065
What do you mean, from my phone? Oh, where is
my phone? I think I left it in your car, I didn't text him.

679
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:51,381
I didn't text you. And I'll prove it!

680
01:12:53,289 --> 01:12:58,472
So, Charlie, Robbie, how does it feel
to be accessories to a crime, huh?

681
01:12:58,858 --> 01:13:02,475
- I mean, really? Dewey's wife?
- My life is over.

682
01:13:02,684 --> 01:13:05,436
So which one of you guys sent me a text
message from Jill's phone, huh?

683
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:13,151
- W-We re just supposed to accept that you re telling the truth?
- Isn't your phone missing?

684
01:13:14,371 --> 01:13:18,542
- Got a new one.
- Really? Oh, that's incredibly convenient.

685
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:22,275
Dewey, it's Hicks.
- What's up?

686
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,985
- Kate Roberts is dead.
- Huh?

687
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:29,124
- And Sidney fled the scene.
- What, what happened to Kate?

688
01:13:29,645 --> 01:13:32,284
- She was stabbed, just like the others.
- And what about Jill?

689
01:13:32,711 --> 01:13:36,256
- No sign of her at all
- Where the hell were Hoss and Perkins?

690
01:13:36,882 --> 01:13:42,199
<i>They were found dead in their car two blocks away.
Multiple stab wounds.</i>

691
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:47,871
<i>Ok. I'm on my way.
- Yes, Sir.</i>

692
01:13:55,773 --> 01:13:58,454
<i>- Wrong number.
- Who was that?</i>

693
01:13:59,006 --> 01:14:00,956
<i>- Oh, nobody.
- Did you pick a movie?</i>

694
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:06,658
<i>- Yeah, we re gonna go scary: Saw IV.
- Oh, I saw that in theaters. It sucks.</i>

695
01:14:06,658 --> 01:14:10,068
<i>It's not scary, it's gross. I hate all that torture porn shit.</i>

696
01:14:10,068 --> 01:14:12,017
<i>Why, angry feel.</i>

697
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:18,867
<i>- Well, I like Jigsaw. I think he kills people very creatively.
- But she don't give a shit who dies...</i>

698
01:14:18,867 --> 01:14:23,007
<i>...cos there's no character to fill a man.
It's just body parts whipping and blood spewing...</i>

699
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,268
Charlie, you wanna sit next to me?

700
01:14:44,234 --> 01:14:53,763
Alright...Get ready for a Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer extra.
Now tonight, there is a good chance that Charlie Walker,

701
01:14:54,045 --> 01:15:05,660
yes, my Charlie Walker, may get lucky with a girl. Now I'm unable to
, to publish my exact location, however, suffice it to say...

702
01:15:06,077 --> 01:15:11,718
Woodsboro High may be in store for some geek history. We'll see.

703
01:15:25,783 --> 01:15:26,950
Hello?

704
01:15:30,328 --> 01:15:31,474
Who's there?

705
01:15:36,969 --> 01:15:38,741
Oh my God.

706
01:15:52,733 --> 01:15:55,517
<i>- Where are you going?
- To make sure the front door is locked.</i>

707
01:15:57,946 --> 01:16:00,909
<i>- No, don't open it.
- You're overreacting.</i>

708
01:16:03,754 --> 01:16:04,766
Hey, Charlie.
- Yeah?

709
01:16:06,851 --> 01:16:13,461
I'm sorry, I know you re into the movie and all
, but...now would be a really good time to make a move.

710
01:16:14,962 --> 01:16:18,434
- For me to make a move?
-Mhh mhh.

711
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:23,970
- Couldn't you make a move?
- I just did.

712
01:16:25,566 --> 01:16:33,958
Cos you re actually pretty cute. Especially
when I'm scared...and lonely...and drunk.

713
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:44,916
Ehi, guys. Did...did you see Jill, coming? I didn't see her outside.
- Yes, Trevor. She is upstairs.

714
01:16:45,438 --> 01:16:48,430
Thank God you re here to protect her when you can't even find her.

715
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:55,905
<i>- There's nobody out here.
- Oh, dude. I love this part of the movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

716
01:16:55,905 --> 01:17:00,356
<i>- What is it say?
- Just when you think they're all safe and comfortable in the house</i>

717
01:17:00,846 --> 01:17:03,173
Ghostface comes in and bang!

718
01:17:06,936 --> 01:17:15,632
- Did I interrupt something for you? Shut the fuck up.
- Who invited you, Trevor?

719
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:20,187
Alright. Clearly not you. Wow.

720
01:17:20,709 --> 01:17:25,578
- I'm moving upstairs.
- Get out of my house!

721
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:34,315
Ehi, ok, I'm a little drunk so, don't blame your Internet connection.

722
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:41,061
Let's see what Charlie is up to, shall we?
Or the saga of Trevor and Jill...

723
01:17:41,446 --> 01:17:45,513
Oh, intrigue of Woodsboro High.
Who needs to kill around with so much drama?

724
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:01,589
Oh, man...

725
01:18:03,465 --> 01:18:06,251
Yeah... That's better.

726
01:18:20,471 --> 01:18:23,401
Wait, no!. You can't, you can't, there's rules.

727
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:27,916
I-I-I'm gay, I'm gay. I mean, if it helps...

728
01:18:35,047 --> 01:18:38,289
<i>...some random girl who gets a call that
undoubtedly ends up getting her killed.</i>

729
01:18:38,289 --> 01:18:41,970
<i>It's all so predictable. There's no
element of surprise. You can see ev...</i>

730
01:18:56,734 --> 01:19:03,895
Kirby! So, my phone was up in your room.
There was no text message sent to Trevor. He is such a liar.

731
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,901
- Where is he?
- What do you mean, where is he, he just went upstairs looking for you.

732
01:19:09,944 --> 01:19:18,681
- He's not upstairs.
- Trevor! Charlie! Robbie!

733
01:19:19,994 --> 01:19:21,183
Maybe they are outside.

734
01:19:22,642 --> 01:19:27,553
Jill...................................... No, it's ok, just I need you to come with me.
Sidney! I am sorry, I should have told you and mom where I was going.

735
01:19:27,553 --> 01:19:32,141
Come with me right now, ok?
Run.

736
01:19:32,423 --> 01:19:33,184
Robbie!

737
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:37,531
Go!

738
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:41,919
Sidney!

739
01:19:44,276 --> 01:19:45,183
Come on!

740
01:19:49,156 --> 01:19:51,137
- The balcony!
- There's no other way out?

741
01:19:51,658 --> 01:19:58,196
- We can jump?
- It's two stories. Where's your cell? Get under the bed.

742
01:19:58,196 --> 01:20:01,531
- What?
- Just do what I say. Get under the bed and don't make a sound and don't come out till I come get you.

743
01:20:01,531 --> 01:20:03,345
- Just go. Trust me!
- Ok.

744
01:20:11,176 --> 01:20:14,794
You got it? You ok? Jill, run. Just keep running. Get out!

745
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,339
- Hello?
- Dewey!

746
01:20:42,339 --> 01:20:46,343
- Sidney, where are you?
- I'm at Kirby's. The killer is here, I need your help.

747
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:47,948
- I'm on my way.
- Ok.

748
01:20:51,077 --> 01:20:52,401
Sid! Sidney!

749
01:20:53,089 --> 01:20:57,718
- I need all units to 329 Whispering Lane.
- All units! 329 Whispering Lane!

750
01:21:18,737 --> 01:21:23,147
Sorry, it's just me. Look, I tried to call 911
with the land line instead, but someone smashed the router.

751
01:21:23,147 --> 01:21:25,274
I think I called them myself
- Well, where's Jill?

752
01:21:26,661 --> 01:21:28,714
Go, go, go, go!

753
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,190
- There's a room down there. We can lock ourselves in.

754
01:21:35,638 --> 01:21:38,870
- I heard you yelling to Jill. Did she get away?
- I think she's safe.

755
01:21:47,086 --> 01:21:49,483
- Kirby, let me in!
- Charlie...

756
01:21:52,059 --> 01:21:56,406
No, no, no, no, no, don't. I just found Robbie.
It's...It's just his blood, please.

757
01:21:56,646 --> 01:22:00,859
- Please, there is someone else out here. Let me in.
- If you can't trust him, don't open the door.

758
01:22:02,839 --> 01:22:06,009
- My God! Let me in!
- Get away from the door, Charlie.

759
01:22:06,457 --> 01:22:10,356
- Kirby, it's me! Please let me in!
- Get away from the door, Charlie!

760
01:22:10,356 --> 01:22:15,508
- It's me!
- I'm sorry, I can't...

761
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:18,604
What the fuck...
- I am sorry.

762
01:22:19,542 --> 01:22:20,824
Behind you! Look out!

763
01:22:23,577 --> 01:22:25,766
No, no, no, no, no!

764
01:22:27,643 --> 01:22:28,696
Kirby!

765
01:22:39,237 --> 01:22:42,365
Oh, no, God, no. He's...Leave him alone!

766
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:44,731
Leave him alone!

767
01:22:48,036 --> 01:22:56,242
<i>- It's Charlie's phone.
- Tell Sidney heads are gonna roll tonight. Tell Sidney it's all because of her.</i>

768
01:22:56,242 --> 01:23:01,987
<i>- Or maybe she wants into his place. I promise to be quick.
- It's him.</i>

769
01:23:01,987 --> 01:23:06,365
Ok, I'm gonna get Jill, she should be in the same place.
Just-just keep him on the phone, I'll be right back ok?

770
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:15,791
<i>- Let him go, please...
- I hear you like horror movies, Kirby. But do you like em so much as him?</i>

771
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:22,891
<i>- Forget watching Stab. You get to live it.
- No, no, no, no, no. He's the expert, it's not me.</i>

772
01:23:22,891 --> 01:23:27,447
<i>- Warm up question: Jason's weapon?
- Uh, it's a machete.</i>

773
01:23:27,447 --> 01:23:33,609
<i>- There, you see? You do know the genre. Michael Mayers?
- Uh, butcher knife.</i>

774
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:36,393
- Leatherface?
- A chainsaw. Please...

775
01:23:36,393 --> 01:23:40,386
<i>- Just ask Sidney if you need some help. Freddy Krueger?
- Uh, uh, razor hands.</i>

776
01:23:40,386 --> 01:23:46,130
<i>- Name the movie that started the slasher craze: "Halloween",
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "The Last House on the Left" or "Psycho"?</i>

777
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:51,135
- "Psycho".
- None of the above. "Peeping Tom". 1960, directed by Michael Powell.

778
01:23:51,135 --> 01:23:56,849
<i>- First movie to ever put the audience in the killer's POV.
- Wait, wait. No, no, no, no.</i>

779
01:23:56,849 --> 01:24:04,919
<i>- Please, just ask me one more question, just one more.
- Alright, Kirby. Then it's time for your last chance question.</i>

780
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:09,756
<i>- Name the remake of the groundbreaking
horror movie in which the villain...</i>

781
01:24:09,756 --> 01:24:16,680
"Halloween", "Texas Chainsaw", "Dawn of the Dead",
"The Hills Have Eyes", "The Amityville Horror", "The Last House on the Left"

782
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:22,549
"Friday the 13th", "A Nightmare on Elm Street",
"My Bloody Valentine", "When a Stranger Calls", "Prom Night"

783
01:24:22,549 --> 01:24:30,066
"Black Christmas", "House of Wax", "The Fog", uh,
"Piranha". It's one of those, right? Right?!

784
01:24:37,896 --> 01:24:41,275
I got it right. I was fucking right!

785
01:24:41,546 --> 01:24:42,318
Jill?

786
01:24:54,839 --> 01:25:01,240
- I won, Charlie. I fucking won. I won. He tried to beat me, but I fucking won.
- It's so great...

787
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:13,001
- Wait, I'm almost there. Just hang tight.
- Kirby? This is making a move.

788
01:25:16,682 --> 01:25:22,875
- 4 years of classes together and you notice me now?
You stupid bitch! It's too late!

789
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:29,767
-Shh, shhhh, I know, I know. It's ok, take your time.

790
01:25:29,767 --> 01:25:34,666
- Doesn't happen as fast as it does in the movies, honey.
- Charlie...

791
01:26:01,775 --> 01:26:02,609
Kirby?

792
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:09,803
You know, you learn the law when you
watch the movies over and over.

793
01:26:10,293 --> 01:26:12,169
All the plots are about trying to kill you.

794
01:26:14,191 --> 01:26:18,614
- Where's Jill?
- Oh, you think she's gonna get away? You think anyone gets away?

795
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:33,220
- Jill?
- Hello, Sidney. Surprised?

796
01:26:34,085 --> 01:26:41,602
Watch this. This is the part when,
dear cousin, the cameras...turn off.

797
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:48,035
- Charlie?
- Want her taken care of.

798
01:26:48,702 --> 01:26:53,706
Then I got great footage in my Robbie kill.
Better than Jenny and Marnie or Olivia even.

799
01:26:53,706 --> 01:26:56,741
Good. We'll cut and upload it later.
Make it all traceable to Trevor.

800
01:26:56,741 --> 01:27:02,820
Speaking of which...Remind you of anything?

801
01:27:03,309 --> 01:27:05,676
- Jill, please...
- Shut up! Dick.

802
01:27:05,676 --> 01:27:10,410
- Everything I learned, I learned from you.
- You think you had a shitty boyfriend, Sidney?

803
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:19,177
Here's one that fucks you, dumps you and doesn't even make you famous.
- What the fuck, Jill, I loved you!

804
01:27:19,177 --> 01:27:21,441
- Shut the fuck up, already!

805
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,206
Sure those cops wanted you to have this, Jill. For your protection.

806
01:27:28,259 --> 01:27:29,093
Put it dow...

807
01:27:32,533 --> 01:27:38,487
- Ehi, please.
- Shouldn't have killed all those people; Trev. Gone and put it on video even.

808
01:27:39,029 --> 01:27:43,356
- But it means a lot that you did it for me.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

809
01:27:43,356 --> 01:27:46,380
I am NOT the girl you cheat on.

810
01:27:51,697 --> 01:27:56,711
- I've gone thru everything. We're definitely good on timeline.
- Oh, yeah. We're perfect.

811
01:27:56,711 --> 01:27:58,349
No, no, no. Please.

812
01:28:05,824 --> 01:28:07,148
Ready for act 3?

813
01:28:08,608 --> 01:28:14,457
- Have figured it out yet, Sidney? Keeping it to our
remake theme, Trevor is this generation's Billy Loomis

814
01:28:14,728 --> 01:28:17,824
and we're the innocent victims: Sidney and Randy.

815
01:28:18,106 --> 01:28:24,581
See, with you, the world just heard about
what happened but with us, they're gonna see it.

816
01:28:24,581 --> 01:28:30,701
It's gonna be a worldwide sensation. And people gotta
see this shit. It's not like anyone reads anymore.

817
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:37,968
I gonna know fame like you never even dreamed of.

818
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:51,783
Last two teenagers standing. This time Randy gets the girl.
You're amazing. And you're the perfect victim.

819
01:28:52,544 --> 01:29:02,532
I was so believable today, wasn't I? I mean, I told so many lies,
I actually started to believe them. I really think that I was born for this.

820
01:29:02,532 --> 01:29:09,277
- How could you do this?
- Do you know what it was like growing up in this family?

821
01:29:09,528 --> 01:29:17,597
Related to you? I mean, all I ever heard was:
Sidney this and Sidney that, and Sidney, Sidney, Sidney.

822
01:29:18,046 --> 01:29:25,668
- You were always so fucking special! Well, now I am the special one.
- You'll slip, they always do.

823
01:29:27,055 --> 01:29:42,015
- Come on, Charlie. Let's go on with this. You have to be strong and hold still. Ok?
- Yeah, yeah, old school, like Billy and Stu. Come on, baby, get it up. Come on.

824
01:29:43,099 --> 01:29:45,633
Shoulder me, shoulder me, shoulder me. Get it up!

825
01:29:52,035 --> 01:29:53,703
Not the way we rehearsed it.

826
01:29:53,703 --> 01:29:57,050
You said it, Charlie: Billy and Stu. Trevor and you.

827
01:29:58,405 --> 01:30:10,301
What the media really loves, baby, is a sole survivor. Just ask you
know who. Trevor was your partner and you, you were the idea man.

828
01:30:20,383 --> 01:30:30,445
- Even your friends?
- My friends? What world are you living in? I don't need friends. I need fans.

829
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:38,901
Don't you get it?! This has never been
about killing you. It's about...becoming you.

830
01:30:39,557 --> 01:30:45,364
I mean, for fuck's sake, my own mother had to die,
no great loss there, so I could stay true to the original.

831
01:30:45,927 --> 01:30:54,446
It's sick, right? Well sick is the new sane.
You had your 15 minutes, no I want mine!

832
01:30:55,457 --> 01:31:05,226
I mean, what am I supposed to do? Go to college, grad school, work?
Look around, we all live in public now, we re all on the Internet.

833
01:31:05,226 --> 01:31:15,287
How do you think people become famous anymore? You don't have
to achieve anything. You just gotta have fucked up shit happen to you.

834
01:31:16,184 --> 01:31:25,410
So, you do have to die Sid. Those are the rules. New movie, new
franchise. There's only room for one lead and, let's face it,

835
01:31:25,410 --> 01:31:28,227
your ingenue days, they are over.

836
01:31:34,868 --> 01:31:36,890
Don't tell me you didn't know this day would come.

837
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:59,236
Oh, fuck!

838
01:34:20,006 --> 01:34:21,227
Come on! Let's move in!

839
01:34:31,662 --> 01:34:34,104
- Check the rooms, both sides and upstairs.
- Yes Ma'm.

840
01:34:52,087 --> 01:35:10,521
Jill can you give us a description...Over
here...Jill...Jill, how does it feel to be a hero?...

841
01:35:21,969 --> 01:35:28,652
- Jill. You made it. That's all that matters.
- True, Charlie and Trev tried to kill me.

842
01:35:28,652 --> 01:35:37,452
And I heard they killed my mom. And Robbie and Kirby too.
- Shhh. Just lay back. Try to rest.

843
01:35:39,537 --> 01:35:44,020
- Is-is your wife...
- She's gonna be fine. She's tough.

844
01:35:46,981 --> 01:35:55,363
If I ever write a book one day I'd, I'd want her to write it with me.
It'd be a good team with our matching wounds and all.

845
01:35:58,533 --> 01:36:10,012
We're survivors now. I just wish Sidney was too.
- Jill, they re not sure yet. It's still touch and go.

846
01:36:11,054 --> 01:36:15,611
But she's in ICU (intensive care unit) and
they think Sidney just might make it.

847
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:25,735
What? I mean, I saw Trevor kill her.
- Look, we don't know yet. But she's hanging on.

848
01:36:29,009 --> 01:36:38,018
I-I-I wanna se her.
- She's not awake yet. And, she may not remember anything. You'll have to help her with that.

849
01:36:39,477 --> 01:36:42,605
All in time. Just get some rest now, ok?

850
01:37:31,659 --> 01:37:36,736
- She gonna be ok?
- Yeah, she's a strong kid.

851
01:37:36,736 --> 01:37:45,537
- She's gonna have to be.
- She asked if you were ok. She thinks you guys should write a book together.

852
01:37:45,537 --> 01:37:49,331
- With your matching wounds.
- Why, she was stabbed in the shoulder?

853
01:37:53,679 --> 01:38:01,509
- How did she know I was too?
- Shit!

854
01:38:08,255 --> 01:38:17,618
You just won't die, will ya? Who are you,
Michael fucking Mayers? Yeah, I don't think so.

855
01:38:22,998 --> 01:38:24,645
Fucking die already!

856
01:38:48,302 --> 01:38:49,865
How are those stitches?

857
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:55,986
<i>Sidney!</i>

858
01:39:00,406 --> 01:39:04,128
- Hicks, get to the Sidney Prescott's room and call for backup!
- Be right up, Sir.

859
01:39:12,646 --> 01:39:16,128
- Sid? Sid.
- Dewey!

860
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:41,495
Is this how it's gonna be, Sid? The ending of the movie was
supposed to be at the house. I mean, this is just...silly.

861
01:39:42,016 --> 01:39:47,230
Consider this an alternate ending. You're not gonna get out of this, Jill.

862
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:48,658
- Of course I will.
- Dewey?

863
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:51,338
Sid...

864
01:39:52,516 --> 01:39:59,126
- Easy..Wait, wait. What about the book?
- Looks like I'll just have to write it myself.

865
01:40:01,357 --> 01:40:02,399
Goddammit!

866
01:40:04,725 --> 01:40:07,718
Don't even think about shooting or I'll blow Dewey's head off.

867
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:12,691
- What, you think I won't do it? Give me your gun!
- Do it.

868
01:40:22,918 --> 01:40:27,277
You just had to be the hero, huh? Give me your gun.

869
01:40:30,091 --> 01:40:34,440
What are you, deaf? Give me...your gun.

870
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:48,911
- And get up. And keep your hands over your head.
- Don't do anything stupi...

871
01:40:50,808 --> 01:40:52,841
Don't fucking tell me what to do.

872
01:40:53,571 --> 01:40:56,771
- Oh, God...
- Now, get up bitch.

873
01:40:57,367 --> 01:41:02,026
- Ok.
- Get up. Now!

874
01:41:02,026 --> 01:41:17,155
- Ok...
- Come on. Let's go. Get your skinny ass out here.

875
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:23,942
- Ok...
- I'm gonna enjoy blowing your head off.

876
01:41:25,016 --> 01:41:32,950
Ok, but can I just have one final word?
- What? Please?

877
01:41:35,568 --> 01:41:36,360
- No...

878
01:41:39,561 --> 01:41:41,406
- Clear.
- Clear?

879
01:41:41,896 --> 01:41:42,521
Clear!

880
01:41:48,403 --> 01:41:52,291
You forgot the first rule of remakes, Jill: Don't fuck with the original.

881
01:41:57,170 --> 01:42:00,820
- Oh my God, Dewey.
- Uh, what hit me?

882
01:42:01,414 --> 01:42:06,074
Don't ask. You ok?

883
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:14,697
- She was standing right behind?
- They always are.

884
01:42:27,636 --> 01:42:31,149
- Oh, God...
- Nice one.

885
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:39,261
- Hicks, you're alive?
- Wear the vest, save your chest.

886
01:42:42,253 --> 01:42:47,955
I got two officers down, several injuries and a new suspect.

887
01:42:50,084 --> 01:42:52,408
We need a doctor, Goddammit!

888
01:42:53,315 --> 01:42:55,609
I dunno about you, but I feel a whole lot better.

889
01:42:59,539 --> 01:43:05,836
We're live at Woodsboro Community Hospital,
awaiting a first public statement from Jill Roberts, survivor.

890
01:43:05,836 --> 01:43:10,362
...a survivor of what is now being called "the Woodsboro Massacre reboot"...

891
01:43:10,362 --> 01:43:13,949
...Jill Roberts is her name. A name the whole world will now know...

892
01:43:13,949 --> 01:43:19,130
...who single-handedly put a stop to this 21st century Woodsboro killing spree...

893
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:27,648
...Jill Roberts of Woodsboro, a girl who's lifted all our spirits tonight.
An American hero, right out of the movies.
