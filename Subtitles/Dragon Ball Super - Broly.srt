1
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,840
Son of a bitch Watch where you're going!

2
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,020
Great King Cold-<i>sama</i> has arrived.

3
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,020
So it would seem.

4
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,260
It has been a long time, King Vegeta.

5
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,530
Great King Cold, my humble greetings.

6
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,370
Allow me to introduce you; this is my son, Freeza.

7
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,910
Oh... an honor to meet you, Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

8
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,580
The pleasure is all mine.

9
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,250
This may seem a bit sudden, but...

10
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,550
I've decided to retire.

11
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,360
From now on, Freeza here will take command of the army.

12
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,000
In other words, the Cold Army shall become the Freeza Army.

13
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,030
Nothing will change.

14
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,110
The Saiyans shall do as Freeza commands.

15
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,140
I suppose the one small difference

16
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,880
is that Freeza is even more cruel than I.

17
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
Greetings.

18
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,060
I have high hopes for you Saiyans.

19
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,200
To commemorate my inauguration

20
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,500
I've brought a new battle item for you all.

21
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,540
It's a brand-new invention called a 'scouter'.

22
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,010
It's like the 'scout-scopes' you've used for reconnaissance

23
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,340
but compact and designed to be worn

24
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,680
and they can be used for communication too.

25
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,780
Like the old scout-scopes

26
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,780
they can measure the battle power

27
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,880
and distance of your opponent.

28
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,890
It seems that several Saiyans are aiming weapons this way.

29
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,100
The Saiyan hiding over there has a battle power of...

30
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,470
2000. Not bad at all.

31
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,780
See, that's how it works.

32
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,280
Aren't they convenient?

33
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,020
For now, I'll give you 500 or so as a gift.

34
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,100
Let me know if you need more.

35
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,290
Well then.

36
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,980
Look how big he's grown!

37
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,450
My son, you are my pride and joy!

38
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,920
You are truly gifted!

39
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,390
That monster Freeza won't be the one to rule the universe...

40
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,420
It shall be you!

41
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,030
I can't wait to see you grow up!

42
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,840
Who is this?

43
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,140
What is he doing inside a special capsule?

44
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,580
This is Broly, the son of Colonel Paragus.

45
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,820
What is the meaning of this?

46
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,820
This incubation chamber is supposed to be for the future Saiyan elite!

47
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,490
Yes, well...

48
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,930
They say Broly has extraordinary potential.

49
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,630
You mean he's as gifted as my son?!

50
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,970
Y-Yes sir...

51
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,410
The researchers said his data is higher than even the prince.

52
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,410
That is impossible!

53
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,910
The prince's data is the highest ever!

54
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,610
Give me that!

55
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,860
My apologies.

56
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,630
Obviously it must be a malfunction.

57
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,230
I'll bring a new meter at once.

58
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,930
I've got one here.

59
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,740
I've measured him again, but his data is only half what it was before.

60
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,440
Although he has registered some extraordinarily high numbers in the past...

61
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,570
I suppose the meter was simply malfunctioning.

62
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,570
But even eliminating those outliers, Broly's potential is quite substantial.

63
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,150
With training, he can grow into a magnificent warrior

64
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,690
and become a major asset for our army.

65
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,030
He could even become a legendary Super Saiyan!

66
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,370
Let go of me!

67
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,240
Pardon my intrusion...

68
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:12,810
But I heard that my son Broly was to be sent in a pod off to a frontier planet.

69
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,810
Indeed.

70
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,420
But that is a job for a low-level warrior.

71
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,990
If he can grow strong enough to subdue that planet

72
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,790
perhaps it will make him into an even more powerful warrior.

73
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,900
Conquering planets and selling them for a high price...

74
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,200
 That is the role of the Saiyan warrior race.

75
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,070
His target is the dwarf planet Vampa...

76
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,740
 A harsh world devoid of civilization.

77
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,740
I doubt it shall fetch a high price.

78
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:49,550
Your son's potential is high...too high.

79
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,650
One might even call him a mutant.

80
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,160
If he becomes mentally unbalanced as he grows up

81
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,060
he may pose a threat to my army, or even to the universe itself.

82
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,570
Be grateful that I have spared his life

83
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,240
and that I am merely exiling him to another world.

84
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,910
But that's... that's... You're...

85
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:21,920
You're simply trying to get rid of Broly because he has greater potential than the prince!

86
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,320
Hold your tongue, or I will have you put to death.

87
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,600
In any case, it is already too late. His pod has just launched.

88
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,560
What?!

89
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,210
Out of my way!

90
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,340
What the–?

91
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,640
Hold on!

92
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
The ship isn't cleared for takeoff!

93
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,620
<i>Your ship isn't cleared. Return at once.</i>

94
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,620
--Take her back down!

95
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,760
I can't do that. I've got to save my son!

96
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:09,030
King Vegeta took pride in the brilliant potential of the prince...

97
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:15,540
So he hated that my son Broly was even more gifted.

98
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,340
It seems his pod is heading for some sort of frontier planet.

99
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,250
A dwarf planet called 'Vampa', orbiting Star No. 94.

100
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,090
Why? There shouldn't be any populated planets out there.

101
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,090
The king wasn't interested in conquering the planet.

102
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,360
He just wanted to kill my son Broly!

103
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,260
S-Surely not...

104
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,930
Don't worry...

105
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,800
Once I rescue Broly, we shall settle down on some other world.

106
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,510
You can return to Planet Vegeta after you drop us off.

107
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,040
You're not going back yourself?

108
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,310
Obviously not.

109
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,050
We would just be killed if we did.

110
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,850
I shall raise Broly into the ultimate warrior

111
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,820
and get my revenge on King Vegeta!

112
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:27,950
[PotatoHead Subs]

113
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,530
So that's the dwarf planet Vampa?

114
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,630
The calculations show that his pod should have arrived about two days ago.

115
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,240
Stay alive, Broly! I'll come rescue you soon!

116
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,710
It should be around here.

117
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,480
This place where the light is shining looks calm. Let's land there.

118
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,680
No, here!

119
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,830
Let's go find him at once. Follow me!

120
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,530
Me too?

121
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,090
That's right. I wouldn't want you taking off while I'm out searching.

122
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,440
I wouldn't do that, trust me.

123
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,270
You can never trust a Saiyan.

124
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,640
Apparently there's an updated version of those scout-scopes, too.

125
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,810
I heard that the new commander 'Freeza' brought them.

126
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,720
I'm aware.

127
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,550
That Freeza is really something.

128
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,120
That is no concern of mine.

129
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,460
What could that be?

130
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,800
What the–?

131
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,650
What was that?!

132
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,050
You've got to be kidding me! I'm not even a fighter!

133
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,430
Looks like it's always stormy at night.

134
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,630
It's hot now though.

135
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,030
Is that a moon over there?

136
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,570
It's nearly full.

137
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,070
Don't look at it too long or you'll become a Great Ape.

138
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,040
Right...

139
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,880
 I've never gone Great Ape before.

140
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,510
We lose control of ourselves when we become Great Ape.

141
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,420
It should be reserved for when there is no other option.

142
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,020
What the–?!

143
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,360
Is the ground soft? This doesn't look like grass.

144
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:00,700
They seem to be drinking something from out of the ground.

145
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,840
What the–?!

146
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,090
That's no field!  It's a giant beast!

147
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,890
The monsters survive by sucking the beast's blood

148
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,460
and the beast survives by eating the monsters.

149
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,170
This planet sure is creepy.

150
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,940
Oh, it's the pod! The pod's over there!

151
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,140
He's not here. Where could he have gone?

152
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,810
Maybe he got eaten...

153
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,220
Over there!

154
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,690
Aw man... are you sure he's here?

155
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,320
Broly!

156
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,590
You attacked the monster and ate its leg.

157
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,590
That's my boy!

158
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,330
So that's Broly?

159
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,200
Battle power...920.

160
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,530
Hey, he's stronger than me!

161
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:43,510
Even an able-bodied boy with a battle power of 920 wouldn't be able to defeat these monsters.

162
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,380
See, his suit's a little baggy...

163
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,880
I bet he looked at the full moon and became a Great Ape.

164
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,420
Let's get off this planet quick.

165
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,690
It sure got banged up.

166
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,230
Oh no!

167
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,960
What's the matter?

168
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,330
The main floater's cracked!

169
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,800
It can't be! Can you fix it?

170
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,440
No way. We'll need a new floater...

171
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,840
Are you saying we're stuck here?!

172
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,880
We can't radio for help out here.

173
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,080
We've got enough food rations and water to last ten days.

174
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,180
Do you really think anyone is going to find us in only ten days?

175
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,390
Ugh, I knew we shouldn't have forced a landing here!

176
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,760
This will save on rations.

177
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,200
Bardock-<i>san</i>...

178
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,070
Bardock-<i>san</i>...

179
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,440
What?

180
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,940
We'll be arriving on Planet Vegeta soon.

181
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,980
It sure has been a long time!

182
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,550
Yeah.

183
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,420
What's going on, anyway?

184
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,190
Why this order for all Saiyans to hurry back to Planet Vegeta?

185
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,690
I hear that bastard Freeza commanded it.

186
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,290
Take off that scouter or he might hear you.

187
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,670
Right!

188
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,270
Look, everyone's swarming back.

189
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,270
Look over there!

190
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,320
 Freeza's ship!

191
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,170
There should still be plenty of time.

192
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,080
Why is he already hanging around here?

193
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,310
Odd, isn't it?

194
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,150
He could just radio us if he had something to say rather than having us come back.

195
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,090
And if he had some new weapon to give us...

196
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,090
we don't need to all hurry back.

197
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,030
There must be something more to this.

198
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,870
That's a little paranoid, don't you think?

199
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:56,140
Conquering planets is the livelihood of the Saiyan warrior race.

200
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:04,620
It was Freeza's father Cold who forced us to do this in his service.

201
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,250
That was a long time ago.

202
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,460
Do you think things are going well now?

203
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,430
Well, there's not a single Saiyan who likes Freeza...

204
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,970
And Freeza feels the same way about the Saiyans.

205
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,600
But Freeza's army has grown.

206
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,110
They can probably get by without us pesky Saiyans.

207
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,050
You mean he's going to wipe us out?!

208
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,270
Maybe so.

209
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,420
You're too much, Bardock-<i>san</i>.

210
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,500
Yo, Bardock! Back alive and well, I see!

211
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,630
Yeah. Do you know the reason for this congregation order?

212
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,310
Beats me. Maybe they've found a big planet...

213
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,010
They might need all of us to conquer it!

214
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,880
Yeah, it's gotta be something like that!

215
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,250
Now that you mention it...

216
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,090
I hear Freeza and his cronies were asking around about the Super Saiyan.

217
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,560
The Super Saiyan...

218
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,130
You mean that legend?

219
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,230
That's it!

220
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,470
Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan God...

221
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,470
I've investigated them, but they seem to be merely legends.

222
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:40,410
Naturally, but I cannot tolerate even the smallest cause for concern.

223
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,980
So then, shall we call off the attack?

224
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,550
Surely you jest!

225
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,890
I've gone to all this trouble to gather them all together.

226
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:57,630
Is this not the perfect opportunity to annihilate them and their entire planet?

227
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,730
Welcome back, Bardock-<i>san</i>!

228
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,600
Hey.

229
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,610
Yo! I'm home, Gine!

230
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,810
Huh? Bardock!

231
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,210
The town is really bustling.

232
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,420
Yeah, everyone has come home.

233
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,680
Where is Raditz?

234
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,350
He's already a combatant!

235
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,020
He's off with Prince Vegeta on another planet.

236
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,290
They haven't come back yet.

237
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,790
Prince Vegeta, huh?

238
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,330
 A tough guy to be partnered with.

239
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,200
What about Kakarot?

240
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,170
Is he still in the incubation capsule?

241
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,270
Yeah, but it should be about time for him to come out soon.

242
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,870
Wanna see?

243
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,410
So small.

244
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,010
Looks like he's a late bloomer.

245
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,080
But he looks just like you!

246
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,780
Especially that distinctive hair!

247
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,790
Let's steal a pod tonight.

248
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,200
Then we'll send him off to some planet.

249
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,760
Eh?! You're joking!

250
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,970
No, I'm serious.

251
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,970
Why would we do that now?

252
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,570
He still hasn't even learned to talk!

253
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,210
With Kakarot's potential

254
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,780
he'll probably be sent off somewhere anyway.

255
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,650
We might as well send him somewhere a bit more agreeable.

256
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,420
But it's still too early!

257
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,890
We might not have much time.

258
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,520
Not much time?

259
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,260
Freeza...

260
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,260
He's afraid that a legendary Super Saiyan might appear.

261
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,830
A Super Saiyan?

262
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,640
 That's just a fairy tale!

263
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,810
Yeah, but he's worried about it all the same.

264
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,780
And now he's plotting something.

265
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,650
I smell death in the air.

266
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,920
I still can't believe any of that.

267
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,760
Don't worry.

268
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,000
We'll go rescue him if it turns out wrong.

269
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,770
Why don't all three of us run away together?

270
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,110
No, their scouters would find us right away.

271
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,940
But...

272
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,340
Why do you have to go to these lengths?

273
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,220
It's not like a Saiyan man to worry about his child.

274
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,390
I suppose that after endless battles

275
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,890
I have the fickle urge to save something now.

276
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:40,700
Especially if it's my low-level warrior son.

277
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,140
I've programmed it for a distant planet called 'Earth'.

278
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,710
The race there has a low technological and combat level.

279
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,310
Even you should be able to survive there.

280
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:02,790
Besides, it's not worth much, so the Freeza Army probably won't attack it.

281
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,020
Bardock is just being paranoid, so we'll come get you right away!

282
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,230
Stay alive, no matter what!

283
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,500
See you later!

284
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,770
Later!

285
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,310
Kakarot!

286
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,400
Without the Saiyans, our fighting force will be cut in half.

287
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,070
We'll manage somehow.

288
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,810
They may act loyal now, but we don't know when they might turn on us.

289
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:08,150
They're a warrior race, after all.

290
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,960
One must nip problems in the bud.

291
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,830
How invigorating!

292
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,640
What?!

293
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,740
What's the matter?

294
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,110
I've received a message from Freeza's army.

295
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,680
They say Planet Vegeta has collided with a meteorite... and...

296
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,820
And... it's been wiped out!

297
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,190
What?!

298
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,730
You mean the Saiyans are now virtually all gone?!

299
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,760
Why didn't we know that meteorite was coming?!

300
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,100
Lucky for us, isn't it?

301
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,340
We ignored Freeza's order to return home.

302
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,070
Guess I'll never be King Vegeta now.

303
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,480
Vegeta, you had a younger brother, right?

304
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,780
Yeah, wonder whatever happened to him?

305
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,910
Oh well, who cares?

306
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,320
Raditz, what about your younger brother?

307
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,990
He was sized up as a low-level warrior

308
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,030
so he's in an incubation capsule back home.

309
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,990
Pathetic!

310
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:32,030
Oh, actually Mom messaged me that they'd sent him out into space in a pod.

311
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,270
Well, whatever.

312
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,800
How delicious!

313
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:41,640
Ohh, food, cake...this summer house really is the best!

314
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,570
Isn't it great?

315
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:08,100
I've been building this summer home 1600km south of West City for the last few years.

316
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Nobody lives here, so it's alright for them to cut loose.

317
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,310
I don't want them wrecking West City, after all.

318
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,520
Pipe down!

319
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,560
Don't be so noisy when you fight!

320
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,060
By the way, Goku-<i>san</i>...

321
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,370
Why are you seeking even greater strength?

322
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,070
Are you trying to be the next God of Destruction?

323
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,180
What was that? I can't let that pass...

324
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,050
No way! I don't wanna be like that!

325
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,080
Well excuse me for being 'like that'.

326
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,520
There was that tournament between all the universes earlier...

327
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,220
That's what showed me there are still crazy strong guys out in the other universes.

328
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,730
It's got me all fired up!

329
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,970
So you've already set your sights on the other universes?

330
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,440
You're as naïve as ever.

331
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,010
Well then Vegeta-<i>san</i>, why do you seek greater strength?

332
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,680
Because of Freeza!

333
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,850
Because he's back now all thanks to this fool's meddling!

334
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:37,060
Whaddaya mean? Universe 7 might've been wiped out if it hadn't been for him!

335
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,860
Wait, really?

336
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,330
Yeah, he really saved our bacon.

337
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,560
You moron! He was just saving his own skin!

338
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,040
You saw Freeza when he came to Earth before, right?

339
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,570
He was able to power up that much in such a short time.

340
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,150
So you think he's gonna get even stronger and come back to beat us?

341
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,050
No doubt about it.

342
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:07,190
Really? Even though we brought him back to life?

343
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,990
Imbecile! Do you really think he'll be grateful for that?

344
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,330
How many times are you gonna call me stupid?

345
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,870
As many times as I want! Dumbass!

346
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,100
It's Trunks.

347
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,510
Hey.

348
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,740
What's up?

349
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,850
It looks like someone broke into your lab.

350
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,320
Huh? What did they take?

351
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,780
Check out the footage.

352
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,890
Let's see...

353
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,660
It was the Dragon Balls you gathered, plus your Dragon Radar.

354
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,630
What?!

355
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,830
Didn't I say you needed better security?

356
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,570
By the way Mom...

357
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,970
We caught the culprits on camera...

358
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,340
They're wearing the same kind of clothes as Papa.

359
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,650
F———

360
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,290
Thank you, Trunks.

361
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,590
So the culprits were from Freeza's army.

362
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,860
He probably sent guys with weak battle powers so it'd be hard for us to sense them.

363
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,760
Freeza sure is obsessed with getting the Dragon Balls.

364
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,270
I wonder what he'd wish for?

365
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,310
It can't be anything that goes beyond Shenlong's power

366
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,040
so wishing to be the strongest in the universe won't work.

367
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,950
Isn't it obvious? He wants to be immortal.

368
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,850
But what's the point of being immortal if he loses?

369
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:49,120
That way he'd always have the chance to surpass us sooner or later!

370
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,560
Really?

371
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,230
I had six Dragon Balls.

372
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,130
They're probably going after the final one now.

373
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,070
Where is it?

374
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,070
On the Ice Continent.

375
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,210
It's cold there, so I saved that one for last.

376
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,070
The Ice Continent?

377
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,780
Will you guys come too?

378
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,680
I'm taking a nap.

379
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,150
My, doesn't this sound interesting?

380
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,220
Will there be anything tasty there?

381
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,350
I highly doubt it.

382
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,190
Then I'll pass.

383
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,490
Great!

384
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,690
 Then you can look after Bra!

385
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,700
Have fun!

386
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,430
Now hold on just a second—

387
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,310
The Ice Continent is pretty cold.

388
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,810
We'd better change into arctic clothes on the way over.

389
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,420
Hey Bulma, why are you gathering the Dragon Balls?

390
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,720
Hush now!

391
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,250
Tell us!

392
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,790
I'm going to make myself younger.

393
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,860
By about five years or so.

394
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,530
You're gathering the Dragon Balls for that?! That's dumb!

395
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,670
Don't you start! You Saiyans wouldn't understand!

396
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,140
Why five years though?

397
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,110
Why not more?

398
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,980
It'd be weird for me to get younger all at once, right?

399
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,250
People would get suspicious.

400
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:22,820
'Ohhhhh, Bulma-<i>san</i>! You look younger all of a sudden!'

401
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,920
'Don't tell me you've... had plastic surgery?'

402
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,330
That sort of thing.

403
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,760
Oh, so you're using the Dragon Balls all the time!

404
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,360
Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

405
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,930
It seems Vegeta's wife has a Dragon Radar and six of the Dragon Balls in her possession.

406
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,000
And we took them!

407
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,970
Now they are heading for the final ball.

408
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,440
Excellent news!

409
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,810
Then shall we take off for Earth?

410
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:26,580
No, we shall wait until all seven balls are gathered.

411
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,390
It is dangerous to land on Earth.

412
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:35,460
Even without scouters, they can sense high battle powers.

413
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,230
Understood.

414
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,870
Have you written down how to get one's wish granted?

415
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,300
Yes sir, I've made no mistakes.

416
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,100
Um, by the way...

417
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,610
What is it, Kikono?

418
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,880
Well... I was just curious...

419
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:01,120
Exactly what are you going to use the Dragon Balls to wish for, Freeza-<i>sama</i>?

420
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Is it immortality like before?

421
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,330
Certainly not.

422
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:15,730
In Earth's Hell, I learned what it's like to be paralyzed.

423
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:20,040
Even if one is immortal, it is unbearable to be unable to move.

424
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:28,650
Then perhaps you could wish to not sustain any damage?

425
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,020
The game wouldn't be interesting like that.

426
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,360
Then what is it?

427
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,190
You'll never guess.

428
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,130
Could it be... that you want to be taller?

429
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,370
Beriblu, how could you say something like that?!

430
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:58,780
After all, Freeza-<i>sama</i> has killed countless soldiers for calling him short.

431
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:04,580
Right as always, Beriblu.

432
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,850
She's right?

433
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,960
Will you promise not to tell anyone?

434
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,890
Of course!

435
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:22,540
I want to be.... five centimeters taller.

436
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:32,240
But then... you'd be quite tall if you stayed in your second form.

437
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,050
No! I want to be taller in my final form!

438
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,690
But... why only five centimeters?

439
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,160
If I got big all of a sudden...

440
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,260
It would be weird, wouldn't it?!

441
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,930
I want it to seem like I'm still growing!

442
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,870
I... see.

443
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,580
I told you, there's nobody around here!

444
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:14,720
It's hard enough finding anyone above a battle power of 1000.

445
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,320
Them's the breaks.

446
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,730
Our orders are to find even a single warrior to help rebuild the army.

447
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,800
Didn't we used to have plenty of soldiers?

448
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,570
Rumor has it that Freeza-<i>sama</i> killed them all for putting up a poor fight.

449
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,880
Cheelye, why did you join Freeza's army?

450
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,280
I got caught stealing a Galactic Patrol ship.

451
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,750
I figured they'd never catch me if I was part of the Freeza Army.

452
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,390
Pitiful!

453
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,020
Maybe so.

454
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,290
You've been in the Freeza Army for ages, right Lemo-<i>san</i>?

455
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,660
Have you ever met Freeza-<i>sama</i>?

456
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,530
I'm not a combatant.

457
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,130
I've only ever seen him once, back at the space station.

458
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,830
I hear he's real short.

459
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,700
Never say that again!

460
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,840
If you want to live, that is.

461
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,270
Okay, I get it.

462
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,940
He's killed people simply for having bad breath.

463
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,720
Still, Freeza must be pretty desperate if he's down to using geezers and women.

464
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,420
What's that?

465
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,090
A distress signal!

466
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,960
And a pretty old-fashioned Freeza Army signal, too.

467
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,430
It's coming from that planet over there.

468
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,660
If we rescue them, maybe we'll get a special bonus!

469
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,670
Alright, let's go!

470
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,610
Nobody's here.

471
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,910
What gives?

472
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,450
Let's check with our scouters.

473
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,920
Are you from the Freeza Army?

474
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,990
Is that a tail?

475
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,300
Don't tell me... you're a Saiyan?

476
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,570
A Saiyan?

477
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,640
Yes, my name is Paragus.

478
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,810
I'm a Saiyan in the Freeza Army.

479
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,810
So that distress signal...

480
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:15,140
Yes, I sent it. My spaceship broke down.

481
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,150
I've been waiting for so very long.

482
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,450
Now I've finally been rescued!

483
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,490
Battle power 4200! Holy cow!

484
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,960
Are you on your own?

485
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,530
No, there's one mor–

486
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,370
Broly!

487
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,790
This is my son, Broly.

488
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,730
No way!

489
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,830
What's wrong?

490
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:08,030
H-His battle power... the scouter can't measure it!

491
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,330
Impossible! There's no way that–

492
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,510
Come with us! Freeza-<i>sama</i> will be thrilled!

493
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,280
Um...what was your name again?

494
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,250
Broly.

495
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:34,090
You want some of this, Broly? It's tasty!

496
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,190
Here!

497
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,500
Hey, take the wrapper off first!

498
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,870
Take it.

499
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,380
How is it? Tasty, right?

500
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,450
Hey, how about a thanks?

501
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,990
Say thank you.

502
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,860
Thank you... very much.

503
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,560
Don't be so formal.

504
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,460
'Thanks' is fine.

505
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,400
Th-Thanks.

506
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,670
See?

507
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,100
Excuse me, Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

508
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,610
Are you really Saiyans?

509
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,710
Indeed.

510
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,220
He doesn't seem to have a tail.

511
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:38,060
Yes, it is a Saiyan characteristic that we transform into Great Apes

512
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:43,160
and lose control of ourselves, so for this reason I removed his tail.

513
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,170
And has he ever lost control of himself since then?

514
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,370
Yes, but only rarely.

515
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,840
So it does happen occasionally, then?

516
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,610
Not to worry! In such cases, with this remote control

517
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:02,580
I can shock Broly through the device around his neck.

518
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,350
It produces a powerful enough current to restrain him.

519
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,150
I see.

520
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,290
What is your name?

521
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,430
He is called Broly.

522
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:23,600
I see he hides an even greater battle power.

523
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,510
I swear that we shall serve you well, Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

524
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,910
This is an unexpected bounty.

525
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:38,150
Beriblu, pay those two who found them the reward money.

526
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,720
A-All this?!

527
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,760
Thank you very much!

528
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:51,630
I'm told that you've only just now escaped from a long exile on a deserted world.

529
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,900
Indeed.

530
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:59,340
Are you aware that Planet Vegeta has been destroyed in the intervening years?

531
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,880
Yes, they informed me on the way here.

532
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,250
However, that is of no concern to me.

533
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,910
And yet...

534
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,680
You still want revenge, do you not?

535
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:22,000
Paragus-<i>san</i>. Are you aware that King Vegeta's son, Vegeta IV, is still alive?

536
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,670
W-What?! King Vegeta's son?

537
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,540
That bastard, Vegeta!

538
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:34,940
I shall help you gain your revenge.

539
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:42,880
Beriblu, once these two have showered, please give them new battle gear.

540
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,890
Certainly.

541
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:52,860
Looks like I won't have to do any fighting myself this time.

542
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,700
This is certainly getting interesting.

543
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,670
Yo!

544
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,880
You clean up good!

545
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,680
Over here!

546
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,810
Broly, where's your battle armor?

547
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:15,980
It's hard to move with that on.

548
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,090
It's not once you put it on.

549
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,190
Well, suit yourself.

550
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:27,730
But you should ditch that pelt around your waist. It's dirty and smelly.

551
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,430
No way!

552
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:36,470
O-Okay then. It must mean a lot to you.

553
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,940
This is my–

554
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,350
Broly, we came to eat, not talk.

555
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,150
What's wrong with a little talking?

556
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,460
Stay out of this.

557
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,130
Huh?!

558
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,260
Well, whatever.

559
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,560
Hey, you're the new recruit right?

560
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,700
It can't be too fun hanging out with these guys.

561
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:13,080
For this current operation, I'm the only full-on combatant on board.

562
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,710
Come with me.

563
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,580
Let go! No means no.

564
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,980
I'll buy you a drink, so–

565
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,820
Stop, Broly.

566
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,760
What's wrong? Gotta problem?

567
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,300
Yes.

568
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,300
In that case...

569
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,940
Damn it! Damn!

570
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,340
Broly!

571
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,670
Are you alright?

572
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,070
Why you...

573
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,340
You've gone too far! How could you do something like that?!

574
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,810
If I hadn't stopped him, he might have killed that man.

575
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,680
Is this the way you've been raising him?

576
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,650
You may be the one who rescued me, but it seems we don't see eye to eye.

577
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,650
From now on, keep away from my son.

578
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:38,300
Paragus-<i>san</i>. Freeza-<i>sama</i> wishes to see you.

579
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,800
Freeza-<i>sama</i>? Yes, I shall be there at once. Broly!

580
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,570
Only your presence is required.

581
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,100
I-Is that so?

582
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,410
Broly, I'll be right back. Hold on.

583
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,580
That guy might be even worse than my late old man.

584
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,820
You stole it?

585
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,030
Here's what I do with crap like this!

586
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,770
Broly, thanks for earlier!

587
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,380
What, would you like a drink of water?

588
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,940
Give me that.

589
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,580
There you go.

590
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,920
What is this?

591
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,360
Huh? Just plain old water.

592
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,460
Haven't you had water before?

593
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,110
Yum!

594
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,480
This is Bah's ear.

595
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,820
Oh, you mean that fur pelt?

596
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,290
I was friends with Bah.

597
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:11,690
Bah was a big, big beast. Even bigger than this ship.

598
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,290
He went 'bah bah', so I named him that.

599
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,500
Bah was very fierce.

600
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:23,470
Every day I trained by dodging his attacks

601
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,410
and we became friends.

602
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,110
Best friends.

603
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,280
So he was your first friend?

604
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:45,460
But Father got angry, since being friends with Bah wasn't training.

605
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,960
And so...

606
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:53,430
Father shot off Bah's ear with a gun.

607
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:58,270
Bah was mad. He was never my friend again.

608
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:03,380
So I keep his ear with me.

609
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:08,880
You're pretty chatty now, Broly.

610
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,190
I have never heard anything so pure before.

611
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,920
You really are innocent.

612
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,400
Could it be that... you don't actually like to fight?

613
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,700
Your fighting potential was high

614
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,340
so your father forced you to train.

615
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:35,780
I bet your dad just sees you as a weapon.

616
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,180
Just a way of getting revenge.

617
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,950
Probably so.

618
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,680
Your old man's the worst.

619
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,890
You don't need to listen to him.

620
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,890
But...

621
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,390
It's wrong to say bad things about Father.

622
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,740
Should be around here.

623
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,270
Dummy, get me outta here quick!

624
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,440
What?

625
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,520
There it is!

626
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:20,920
We're going to this planet called 'Earth'.

627
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,060
Vegeta is there, along with another Saiyan.

628
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,560
I want you to show them Broly's power.

629
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,170
Broly has been gifted with great power since birth.

630
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,070
You shall see how I gain my revenge after all these years.

631
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:39,610
However... while you may do whatever you wish with Vegeta...

632
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:46,180
please allow me to finish off the other Saiyan, Son Goku.

633
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:51,850
Son Goku... I have dreamed of killing him for years!

634
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,390
Understood.

635
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,630
Freeza-<i>sama</i>, all seven Dragon Balls have been assembled!

636
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,030
Oh, that's marvelous!

637
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,710
Over there! It's Freeza's army!

638
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:18,580
Tch. So they've found the last one.

639
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,550
That ship's bad news, right?

640
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,590
Could it be the Saiyans that Kikono-<i>sama</i> told us about?

641
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,860
Boy, it sure is cold!

642
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,000
Whis-<i>san</i>, I'm impressed it doesn't bother you.

643
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,500
It's even colder out in space, after all.

644
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,940
Oh no, the scouter numbers are off the chart!

645
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,680
It's the Saiyans! Run!

646
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,790
Hey you! Give back those Dragon Balls you took!

647
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,630
Whadda we do?

648
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:06,700
Obviously we'd better hand them over.

649
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,700
Otherwise this guy'll kill us.

650
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,540
B-b-b-b-but Freeza-<i>sama</i> will kill us if we do that!

651
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:39,160
Well, looks like Freeza's here.

652
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,000
What the–?

653
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,870
Freeza's not alone. There's someone else...

654
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,340
Someone amazing!

655
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,840
Aren't those two Saiyans?

656
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:25,940
It's Vegeta!

657
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,410
No doubt about it.

658
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,250
He looks just like the king!

659
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:38,560
What've you come here for, Freeza?

660
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:44,560
Surely you know already? To get my wish granted with the Dragon Balls.

661
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,270
What are those ball things?

662
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:54,040
Beats me. We should ask someone.

663
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,580
Hey, go get those Dragon Balls back!

664
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,280
This isn't the time for that.

665
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,190
I suppose you could say this is the custom of a warrior race.

666
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,450
Freeza! Who are those two?

667
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:15,030
These are the latest recruits to my army: Broly and his father...

668
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,630
Paragus.

669
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:22,870
Yes indeed. As I'm sure you can tell, they're both Saiyans like yourselves.

670
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,740
I've never seen them before.

671
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,640
It seems that when you were still little, Broly-<i>san</i> and Paragus-<i>san</i>

672
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,850
were cruelly exiled by your father, King Vegeta

673
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:39,420
to an inhospitable planet where they have been trapped ever since.

674
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,090
Freeza...

675
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,730
What does 'inhospitable' mean?

676
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,870
It means a harsh environment.

677
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,470
Got it.

678
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,740
Idiot.

679
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,110
I will never forgive you!

680
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,810
Vegeta!

681
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,480
I've come to get my revenge!

682
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,990
Give me a break! I don't care about that crap.

683
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:19,760
Either way, we're all Saiyans here. Let's fight!

684
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,400
Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

685
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,940
It seems he can't hold himself back any longer.

686
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:36,540
How about it then? Shall you show me just how powerful he really is?

687
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,650
Understood.

688
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,350
All right then. Broly, get him!

689
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,440
You're not bad. My body's finally warmed up!

690
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,190
<i>He's fast.</i>

691
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,300
<i>Could it be that... he's learning how to use his power?</i>

692
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:35,500
It seems Vegeta has trained extensively too.

693
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:40,040
Oh, he has seen his fair share of battles.

694
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,810
But then, it seems Broly isn't used to this.

695
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:47,850
Broly-<i>san</i> has never fought against anyone before, has he?

696
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,990
We've conducted battle simulations together...

697
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:55,620
A battle power like yours would hardly make for good practice.

698
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,630
Don't worry; he'll get the hang of this soon enough.

699
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,910
That's it, Broly!

700
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,260
You're pissing me off!

701
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:59,260
W-What is that?!

702
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:04,630
Oh? Can't Broly become a Super Saiyan?

703
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:08,970
S-Super Saiyan? Impossible!

704
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:10,800
The legendary...

705
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,700
W-What's with this guy?!

706
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,540
He's learning fast!

707
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,740
This guy's awesome! He's holding his own in his regular form!

708
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:13,790
I never imagined Vegeta would grow so strong.

709
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:16,600
Oh? Is that Broly's limit then?

710
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,600
Y-yes...

711
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,500
Well, alright then.

712
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,640
Let's head back for today.

713
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,710
Yes sir.

714
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:32,880
What the–?

715
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,420
Oh no! Broly! That's enough for today!

716
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,460
Stop it! Come back!

717
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:57,400
It's gone! The remote's gone! It can't be!

718
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,840
Broly! I told you to stop!

719
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:10,180
Are you ignoring me?!

720
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,220
How stupid.

721
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,390
Stop it, Vegeta!

722
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:15,550
You've gotta be kidding!

723
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:16,720
Wha–

724
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,890
Have you ever seen a Saiyan like that before?!

725
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:22,390
Hey Kakarot, did you bring any senzu?

726
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:23,590
Nope!

727
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:27,130
This is no time to be playing around!

728
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:55,860
Yikes! If that had hit the ground...!

729
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:06,900
Vegeta!

730
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,510
What is that?

731
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,310
W-Well...

732
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:20,850
It seems he has become able to wield the power Saiyans gain as Great Apes

733
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:27,860
while still in his human form, without the Great Ape's slow-moving body.

734
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,890
Is there a problem?

735
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:33,230
Just that...

736
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:39,470
he's now out of my control.

737
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,750
Hey, you!

738
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,190
It's about time you fight with me!

739
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,470
Hey, calm down!

740
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:19,290
We're peacefully living here on Earth.

741
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,040
Though a lot happened along the way.

742
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:39,480
You're not a bad guy. I can tell.

743
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:45,620
Cut this out. Don't do what bad guys tell you to do.

744
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:29,600
Freeza-<i>sama</i>! Is it alright if I go a little further away?

745
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,930
That probably would be for the best.

746
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:40,410
We shall look after the Dragon Balls for you!

747
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:48,650
Now we can watch your son's performance without worrying.

748
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:18,110
I didn't know he was this incredible!

749
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:22,050
But this isn't the real him.

750
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:30,630
It's his father's fault!

751
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:31,960
Yeah.

752
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,230
He forced the gentle Broly to do his bidding

753
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:40,340
and this is the result.

754
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,870
Guess so.

755
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:48,080
My heart goes out to him.

756
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:59,060
At this rate... I'll be killed... by Broly!

757
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,360
It's all over!

758
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,440
My my, guess I don't get a turn this time.

759
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,550
Son!

760
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,460
What are you up to?

761
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,490
This <i>ki</i> isn't just Freeza.

762
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,660
Yeah, guess so...

763
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:47,230
Looks like you're in the middle of a fight.

764
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,770
That's right.

765
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,910
This <i>ki</i> is tremendous.

766
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:56,110
Even if I went...

767
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:58,180
I'd probably just get in the way.

768
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,150
Sorry, but please hang back.

769
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:09,620
If things get nasty, I'll teleport over to you.

770
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:21,470
This must be quite an opponent for you to say something like that.

771
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,910
Yep.

772
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,860
P-Perhaps...

773
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:27,360
King Vegeta was right after all...

774
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:45,880
Has he really hit his limit this time?

775
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,750
Yes.

776
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,650
I see.

777
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:54,820
Shall we give that a try?

778
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:08,000
Broly-<i>san</i>! Look at this!

779
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,870
Broly-<i>san</i>!

780
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:14,680
Your father has been killed!

781
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,400
Yes! It worked!

782
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:02,220
Excellent! That's the face I've been waiting for.

783
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,820
What are you messing around for?!

784
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,060
Idiot!

785
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,200
This is no time to get hung up on fighting him one-on-one!

786
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,770
I hate to admit it, but you may be right.

787
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,490
Let's go, Vegeta!

788
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:35,960
Damn it all!

789
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,520
Gallic Ho!

790
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,260
Kamehame...

791
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:41,260
HA!

792
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:56,110
Just a moment! I am Freeza!

793
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,150
Now Vegeta! Hang on!

794
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:05,590
W-What the–?!

795
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:12,090
What—what the hell is going on?

796
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,360
Let go!

797
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,030
No time for explanations now.

798
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:20,100
Piccolo, have you got any senzu?

799
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,200
No, I don't.

800
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,140
Hey, Vegeta.

801
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,110
Do you know about Fusion?

802
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:30,840
Fusion?

803
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,250
Now that you mention it,
I've heard about it from Trunks.

804
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,090
That's the technique where you merge together by moving around like morons!

805
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:41,320
Yep, you go Fu... sion!

806
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,520
Give me a break!

807
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,490
No way am I merging with you!

808
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,460
It's just for thirty minutes.

809
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:50,770
We merged before with the Potara, right?

810
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:55,700
Well, we don't have any Potara here, so Fusion's the only way we can beat that guy!

811
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,110
Okay, maybe merging is our only choice, but...

812
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:02,210
this or this or this... No way am I gonna do that!

813
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,310
We gotta do this if we're gonna win!

814
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:07,020
Otherwise the Earth might get destroyed!

815
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,480
Hn, that's the way the cookie crumbles.

816
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:14,660
You really don't mind if your sweetheart Bulma dies?

817
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,230
Cut that out! It's embarrassing!

818
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:23,160
Tch... Fine then, show me how this is done!

819
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:46,420
Impressive that you've managed to push me this far.

820
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:53,730
Let me show you the power of Golden Freeza!

821
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:58,570
Fu... sion... Ha!

822
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:01,370
What an embarrassing pose!

823
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:06,380
So that's Fusion! There's no time! Let's try it out!

824
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,740
What's wrong, Vegeta?

825
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:11,350
I'd rather die...

826
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:17,920
Fu... sion... Ha!

827
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:34,940
Now I'm all-powerful!

828
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:39,810
No, you didn't line up your fingers right! Do it again in thirty minutes!

829
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:52,360
Fu... sion... Ha!

830
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,000
That's no good at all!

831
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,370
You weren't perfectly symmetrical! Try again in thirty minutes.

832
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:12,810
Fu... Sion... HAA!

833
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,000
Yes! Now go beat that guy!

834
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,530
Um...

835
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:38,140
What should I call you, anyway?

836
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:44,240
Umm... with the Potara it was 'Vegetto', right? In that case, then...

837
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,240
Whatever! Just hurry up and go!

838
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:54,890
No, it probably would be cooler if I had a name. This time I'll be... Um...

839
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:56,690
Gogeta!

840
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:08,830
Marvelous...

841
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,740
What a marvelous battle power!

842
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:16,840
Who are you?

843
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,710
I am Gogeta...

844
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:22,350
The fusion of Goku and Vegeta.

845
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,320
Fusion?

846
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,590
You were dead for a long time,
so you wouldn't know.

847
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:32,860
This is a tremendous power-up that goes beyond merely adding their two powers together.

848
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,990
T-That's dirty!

849
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:38,860
You're a fine one to talk.

850
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,800
Over here!

851
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:49,980
Oh my.

852
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,080
Whis-<i>san</i>, leave the rest to me.

853
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:57,250
My my, so you two can merge together!

854
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:00,190
Ahh, it must be that Fusion thing!

855
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,560
Come on!

856
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,090
Watch this!

857
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,990
Broly's gonna get killed at this rate!

858
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:55,460
His father turned him into a fighting machine.

859
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:58,770
He's not fighting because he wants to.

860
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:03,410
Broly is really a gentle, pure-hearted Saiyan!

861
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:05,410
We can't let him die!

862
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:24,360
I shall grant any wish, but only one.

863
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,760
So, what do I do?

864
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,860
Hurry up and tell me!

865
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,530
Or I'll shoot!

866
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:35,700
Okay, okay!

867
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:38,840
You just have to speak your wish!

868
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,470
What, is that all?

869
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,780
Then my wish is...

870
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,670
Magnificent!

871
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:25,080
He might have settled things with that one!

872
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:32,050
Ka...

873
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:34,420
Me...

874
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,490
Ha...

875
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:39,090
Me...

876
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:45,670
HA!!

877
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:58,580
Take Broly back to the planet where we found him!

878
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:23,240
Your wish has been granted.

879
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,270
Fare thee well.

880
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:45,130
Get in, Cheelye!

881
01:29:58,210 --> 01:29:59,640
Whoopsie.

882
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,790
I'll be back.

883
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:29,070
Looks like they managed something.

884
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,110
Sorry for getting you mixed up in all this.

885
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:45,590
Don't worry about it. That's the most fun I've ever had since joining the Freeza Army.

886
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:48,690
Wonder if they'll come after us?

887
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:52,030
Who knows?

888
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:55,230
So then, where will you go, Cheelye?

889
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:57,130
To Broly's planet!

890
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:59,170
Vampa, huh?

891
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:01,700
What planet do you want to get off on?

892
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:07,610
No, I'm sticking with you. I'll be in danger no matter where I go.

893
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:11,680
So it's probably safer to be close to someone strong like Broly.

894
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:15,590
Whoa...

895
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:19,750
Well then, we'd better buy some food and stuff on the way there!

896
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:25,200
As suspected, those two seem to be with Broly.

897
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,870
Let's leave them alone for the time being.

898
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:32,340
We'll let them handle getting Broly's emotions under control.

899
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:37,370
If he can learn how to utilize that extreme power without losing control of himself

900
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:40,410
he'll be the greatest of soldiers.

901
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:43,550
Will that really work?

902
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,480
I certainly hope so.

903
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:53,190
No matter how hard I may work to raise my own battle power

904
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:56,730
I'm up against two people, Son Goku and Vegeta.

905
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:03,230
So I want at least one more person in my corner.

906
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:25,420
You've got to be kidding me... I've gotta eat this?

907
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:31,600
Ugh, it's bitter, but I guess it beats starving to death.

908
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:37,670
Eugh... I can't eat this.

909
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:42,510
Don't be so picky! We'll only last fifty days with the food supplies we bought.

910
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:47,110
Someone's here.

911
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,150
Hey! Anyone home?

912
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:56,620
Hm? Hey, who are you guys?

913
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,690
You're... that Saiyan from Earth!

914
01:32:59,690 --> 01:33:04,530
Oh yeah, you're the Freeza soldier who used the Dragon Balls!

915
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:07,900
Why are you here?

916
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,270
So you two are Broly's friends?

917
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:13,810
Hey, I asked what you're doing here!

918
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:18,440
Calm down! It's not like I'm here to fight.

919
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,880
Then what?

920
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:25,050
I heard this planet sucked, so I brought you lots of stuff.

921
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:29,220
We don't need that! Go home! You're not fooling us!

922
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:37,630
I got this from Bulma.

923
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:40,130
Ah... stand clear.

924
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:50,310
There's water and food and all kinds of stuff inside!

925
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:57,580
And these are senzu. I'm giving you two.

926
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:00,890
Eat them when you think you're gonna die.

927
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:06,730
They don't work when you're sick, but they'll heal your injuries and fill up your stamina.

928
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:09,000
What are you plotting?

929
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,860
It's not like that!

930
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:12,900
I just want you to stay alive and well.

931
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:21,340
I was pretty sure of my strength, but then Broly here showed up and was way stronger!

932
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:26,480
He's a Saiyan like me, but he's probably stronger than Beerus-<i>sama</i>!

933
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,680
Beerus is this god I know.

934
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:37,060
It'd be a darn shame for someone so amazing to die, right?

935
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:47,570
Anyway, take care for now. Later!

936
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:50,240
Hey, don't you have a spaceship?

937
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,640
How'd you get here?

938
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:56,810
I can teleport. I just searched for Broly's <i>ki</i>.

939
01:34:56,810 --> 01:35:00,380
I didn't understand a word of that.

940
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,180
I'm off then!

941
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:06,250
For the record, we are your enemies.

942
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:11,690
We may have been fired from Freeza's army, but we haven't become friends with you.

943
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:14,330
I don't care either way.

944
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:15,400
Eh?

945
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:19,470
I just want to come here every now and then to fight Broly.

946
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:25,070
He might want me to teach him a few things too.

947
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:28,410
You seem completely twisted.

948
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:29,840
Why's that?

949
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:35,050
Well anyway... thanks for all the stuff!

950
01:35:35,050 --> 01:35:37,920
Okay then, I'll be back!

951
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,990
We might be gone by then.

952
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:45,590
Don't worry, I'll be able to find you as long as you don't go too far away.

953
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:50,470
Hey, what's your name?

954
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:57,740
Son Goku. Or...

955
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:00,280
Kakarot!

956
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:25,430
"Blizzard" by Daichi Miura
Lyrics: kanzenshuu.com/lyrics/ja-blizzard

957
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:46,120
Tanshoku no daichi asa de mo kurai

958
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:46,120
単色の大地 朝でも暗い

959
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:46,120
A monochrome land, dark even in morning

960
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:52,600
Haritsumeta taiki narabu hyoukai

961
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:52,600
張りつめた大気 並ぶ氷塊

962
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:52,600
Mounds of ice lined up in the taut atmosphere

963
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:58,970
Migi ni narae sou oshierarete

964
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:58,970
右に倣え そう教えられて

965
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:58,970
Taught to do as those around me

966
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:06,710
Nita you na shiawase kizukeba kokyuu made kouritsuku

967
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:06,710
似たような幸せ 気付けば呼吸まで凍りつく

968
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:06,710
And find a similar happiness—before I know it, even my breath is frozen solid

969
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:10,080
Koko wa buatsui koori no man’naka

970
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:10,080
ここは分厚い氷の真ん中

971
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:10,080
Here amidst the thick ice

972
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,650
Itsu kara ka tozashita kokoro no kara

973
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,650
いつからか閉ざした心の殻

974
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,650
How long has this shell of a heart been locked up?

975
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:17,120
Kitai o tsumekomu atsu ga ranhansha

976
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:17,120
期待を詰め込む圧が乱反射

977
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:17,120
The pressure of cramming in expectations reflects back all over

978
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,660
Kodou ga onore ni toitadasu

979
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,660
鼓動が己に問い正す

980
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,660
And my pulse questions of me

981
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:26,400
Sobieru kyoudai na kabe koeru no wa dare no tame

982
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:26,400
そびえる強大な壁 越えるのは誰の為

983
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:26,400
For whose sake do you overcome that gigantic, looming wall?

984
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:33,140
Oh Oh Oh Oh jibun o mezashite

985
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:33,140
Oh Oh Oh Oh 自分を目指して

986
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:33,140
Oh Oh Oh Oh, Your aim is to be yourself

987
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:40,040
Nani o seotte itatte sono te no naka no jinsei

988
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:40,040
何を背負っていたって その手の中の人生

989
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:40,040
No matter the things you bear, the only one who can determine

990
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:46,350
Oh Oh Oh Oh kimeru no wa hoka no

991
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:46,350
Oh Oh Oh Oh 決めるのは他の

992
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:46,350
Oh Oh Oh Oh, The life that’s in your hands

993
01:37:46,350 --> 01:38:03,930
Dare de mo nai no sa kimi ni shika nai mirai e

994
01:37:46,350 --> 01:38:03,930
誰でもないのさ 君にしかない未来へ

995
01:37:46,350 --> 01:38:03,930
Is no one else but you, heading toward a future that’s nowhere but inside you

996
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:18,820
Semai sekai  fusagu futa

997
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:18,820
狭い世界　塞ぐ蓋

998
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:18,820
A cramped world, a lid that seals

999
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:22,120
Kareta yume  karamu tsuta

1000
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:22,120
枯れた夢　絡む蔦

1001
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:22,120
Withered dreams, tangled ivy

1002
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,620
Fukai kiri  sakebu ima

1003
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,620
深い霧　叫ぶ今

1004
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,620
Deep fog, I now scream

1005
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:28,990
Subete fukitobasu like a blizzard

1006
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:28,990
全て吹き飛ばすLike A Blizzard

1007
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:28,990
Blowing it all away like a blizzard

1008
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:39,170
Break the ice, break the ice,
break the ice now

1009
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:39,170
Break the ice, break the ice, break the ice now

1010
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:43,270
Break the ice, break the ice,
break the ice now

1011
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:43,270
Break the ice, break the ice, break the ice now

1012
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:52,880
Break the ice, break the ice,
break the ice now

1013
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:52,880
Break the ice, break the ice, break the ice now

1014
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:56,520
Break the ice, break the ice,
break the ice now

1015
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:56,520
Break the ice, break the ice, break the ice now

1016
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:03,260
Sobieru kyoudai na kabe koeru no wa dare no tame

1017
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:03,260
そびえる強大な壁 越えるのは誰のため

1018
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:03,260
For whose sake do you overcome that gigantic, looming wall?

1019
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:10,000
Oh Oh Oh Oh jibun o mezashite

1020
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:10,000
Oh Oh Oh Oh 自分を目指して

1021
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:10,000
Oh Oh Oh Oh, My aim is to be myself

1022
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,910
Arifureta seikai yori hitotsu dake no kotae o

1023
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,910
ありふれた正解より ひとつだけの答えを

1024
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,910
The only person who can choose the one true answer

1025
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:23,220
Oh Oh Oh Oh erabu no wa hoka no

1026
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:23,220
Oh Oh Oh Oh 選ぶのは他の

1027
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:23,220
Oh Oh Oh Oh, Instead of some mundane idea of 'right'

1028
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:33,990
Dare de mo nai no sa koko ni shika nai mirai e

1029
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:33,990
誰でもないのさ ここにしかない未来へ

1030
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:33,990
Is no one else but me, heading toward a future that’s nowhere but here

1031
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:45,800
Monogatari wa tsuzuite ’ku

1032
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:45,800
物語は続いてく

1033
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:45,800
And the story goes on….

1034
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:49,280
おわり

1035
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:49,280
owari

1036
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:49,280
THE END
