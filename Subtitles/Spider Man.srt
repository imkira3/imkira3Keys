1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,300
<i>Who am I? You sure you want to know?</i>

3
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,762
<i>The story of my life</i>
<i>is not for the faint of heart.</i>

4
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,556
<i>If somebody said</i>
<i>it was a happy little tale...</i>

5
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:22,227
<i>... if somebody told you I was just an</i>
<i>average guy, not a care in the world...</i>

6
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,188
<i>... somebody lied.</i>

7
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:28,650
<i>But let me assure you, this,</i>
<i>like any story worth telling...</i>

8
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,235
<i>... is all about a girl.</i>

9
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:35,574
<i>That girl. The girl next door.</i>
<i>Mary Jane Watson.</i>

10
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,827
<i>The woman I've loved</i>
<i>since before I liked girls.</i>

11
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:41,663
<i>I'd like to tell you that's me</i>
<i>next to her.</i>

12
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,832
<i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i>

13
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,753
Hey! Stop the bus!

14
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:49,922
<i>That's me.</i>

15
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,007
Tell him to stop! Please!

16
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:53,425
Stop!

17
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,844
Hey! Stop the bus!

18
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:59,098
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven.

19
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:00,516
Catch a cab, Parker!

20
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,773
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

21
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:14,488
What a geek!

22
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:19,368
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

23
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:21,120
Would you date him?

24
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,223
Midtown High seniors.

25
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,102
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.

26
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:48,856
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

27
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:52,484
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

28
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,903
So behave accordingly.

29
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,115
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

30
00:04:58,323 --> 00:04:59,950
Come on, stay together.

31
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:03,036
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

32
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,249
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

33
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,960
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

34
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:15,549
- Can we drive around the corner?
- Why?

35
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,551
The entrance is right there.

36
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,430
Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.

37
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:23,974
I should trade my car for a Jetta...

38
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,935
...because you flunked out
of private school?

39
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,272
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

40
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,277
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

41
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:36,779
It's just...

42
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,405
Just what, Harry?

43
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:40,115
Forget it.

44
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:44,453
Pete!

45
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,372
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

46
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,459
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks.

47
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:55,380
- This is my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.

48
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,051
- It's an honor, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.

49
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:02,137
I'm something of a scientist myself.

50
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:05,474
I read your research
on nanotechnology. Brilliant.

51
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:08,685
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

52
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:12,189
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

53
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:16,902
- I live with my aunt and uncle.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!

54
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,739
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.

55
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:26,578
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.

56
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:28,705
I think he wants to adopt you.

57
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:29,498
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

58
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:33,585
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

59
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,589
They're in the order <i>Araneae</i>,
divided into three suborders.

60
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:38,882
That's amazing!

61
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:42,970
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the East Coast.

62
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,347
It's unreal.

63
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:48,308
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

64
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:52,020
...varying strengths
to help them search for food.

65
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,442
For example, the Delena spider,
family <i>Sparassidae</i>...

66
00:06:56,608 --> 00:07:00,779
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

67
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:02,698
For the school paper?

68
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:12,207
Next, we have the net web spider,
family <i>Filistatidae</i>...

69
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,293
...genus <i>Kukulcania</i>.

70
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:18,881
Spins a funnel- shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

71
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:24,344
...proportionately equal to
the high-tension wires used in bridges.

72
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:26,472
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

73
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:29,641
Or his father will fire your father.

74
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,394
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

75
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:35,064
What is going on?

76
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,317
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

77
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,527
- This spider...
- Let's go.

78
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:44,865
...hunts using reflexes with
n<i>erve</i>- conduction velocity so fast...

79
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:48,577
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

80
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,913
- An early awareness of danger.
- Jerks.

81
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:52,873
A spider- sense.

82
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:55,167
Hey, look at that spider.

83
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:59,755
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

84
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,924
It's a defense mechanism.

85
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:05,385
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?

86
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,762
Who wouldn't?

87
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:10,766
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility...

88
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:15,312
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

89
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:20,275
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.

90
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:24,154
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

91
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:25,739
I love them!

92
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,950
Yeah, me too.

93
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,788
You know, spiders can change
their color...

94
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:36,792
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

95
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,088
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

96
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:44,675
- Transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

97
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:47,970
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

98
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:52,808
...into these 15 genetically
designed super- spiders.

99
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:54,476
There's 14.

100
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,311
I beg your pardon?

101
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:59,022
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

102
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,570
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

103
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,783
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the East Coast?

104
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,037
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

105
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:15,956
Let's talk about listening.

106
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:22,796
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

107
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,131
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

108
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,216
...but at Midtown High...

109
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:38,437
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

110
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:40,064
- Sure.
- Great.

111
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:42,566
Where do you want me?
Over here?

112
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,109
Yeah, that's great.

113
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:46,195
Don't make me look ugly.

114
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,405
That's impossible.

115
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,914
Perfect.

116
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,215
- Is that good?
- Great.

117
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:13,138
That's great.

118
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:20,729
M.J., let's go!

119
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:24,858
Wait. Thanks!

120
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,083
Parker, let's do it.

121
00:10:57,808 --> 00:11:01,270
We've solved the horizon glide
and the balance issues.

122
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,981
I've already seen the glider.

123
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,442
That's not what I'm here for.

124
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,319
General Slocum, good to see you again.

125
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:12,322
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

126
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,408
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

127
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:18,120
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

128
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:21,749
I want the report on human
performance enhancers.

129
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:26,420
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

130
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,464
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

131
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,715
Once.

132
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:32,551
All the tests since
have been successful.

133
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:36,472
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

134
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,974
Violence, aggression...

135
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:40,893
...and insanity.

136
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,812
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

137
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:47,900
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our staff certifies the product...

138
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,986
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

139
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:55,991
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

140
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:59,661
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

141
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,664
I'll be frank with you.

142
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:07,753
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

143
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,672
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

144
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,759
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton.

145
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:18,013
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

146
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,267
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

147
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:26,897
...l'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

148
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,359
Gentlemen. Ladies.

149
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:40,869
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilà! There is light.

150
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,205
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

151
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:48,210
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

152
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:50,963
I'm already on my ass, May.

153
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,634
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

154
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:58,512
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.

155
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,056
Hand me that dish. The green one.

156
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:04,059
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

157
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,395
...and upsizing their profits.

158
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:09,565
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

159
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,485
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

160
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,406
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

161
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:19,199
Computer...

162
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:23,162
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

163
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:27,082
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

164
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:32,671
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

165
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,758
I love you. And Peter loves you.

166
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:39,261
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

167
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:43,932
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

168
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:49,354
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

169
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:52,107
How you doing? How was the field trip?

170
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,110
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

171
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:57,780
- You won't have a bite?
- Had a bite.

172
00:13:57,946 --> 00:14:00,365
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

173
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,036
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

174
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:07,039
What's that all about?

175
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,521
<i>In this recombination lab...</i>

176
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:35,317
<i>... we use synthesized transfer RNA</i>
<i>to encode an entirely new genome...</i>

177
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:38,570
<i>... combining the genetic</i>
<i>information from all three...</i>

178
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:43,575
<i>... into these 15 genetically</i>
<i>designed super-spiders.</i>

179
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:02,010
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

180
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:05,514
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

181
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:09,351
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

182
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,729
Don't be a coward.

183
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,773
Risks are part of laboratory science.

184
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:18,694
Let me reschedule,
with a medical staff and a volunteer.

185
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:21,363
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks?

186
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,034
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

187
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:28,954
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

188
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,790
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

189
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:35,711
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

190
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,299
40,000 years of evolution...

191
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:44,219
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

192
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,401
Oh, that's cold.

193
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:59,128
Norman?

194
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:04,925
Norman!

195
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:16,979
Oh, my God.

196
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,898
Oh, my God!

197
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:24,403
Oh, my God! Norman!

198
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,421
Back to formula?

199
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,540
Weird.

200
00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:30,844
- Peter?
- Yeah?

201
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,805
Are you all right?

202
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:36,350
I'm fine.

203
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:40,312
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?

204
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:43,232
Yep. Big change.

205
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:47,403
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.

206
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,172
Okay.

207
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:15,681
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

208
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,558
- I got better.
- See?

209
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:21,103
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?

210
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,940
Don't forget, we're painting
the kitchen after school.

211
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,901
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

212
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,195
And don't start up with me.

213
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,451
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

214
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,122
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

215
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,876
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

216
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,936
Hi, M.J.

217
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:05,314
Hey, M.J.

218
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:10,110
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

219
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,614
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

220
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:15,115
I got the car. Hop in.

221
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:18,160
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

222
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:22,206
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

223
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:23,707
Or not.

224
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:31,882
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

225
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:35,969
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

226
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:38,013
Tell him to stop.

227
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,682
- Check him out!
- Dork!

228
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,415
Dad!

229
00:21:04,873 --> 00:21:06,750
Dad, are you all right?

230
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:08,877
Harry.

231
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:14,216
What are you doing on the floor?

232
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:15,717
I don't know.

233
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:18,887
Have you been there all night?

234
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:22,141
Last night I was...

235
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:25,728
What?

236
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:29,398
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

237
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:31,275
Sir, I asked her to wait.

238
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:35,779
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

239
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:36,989
What?

240
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:40,743
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

241
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:44,288
- What?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

242
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:46,457
- What about it?
- Stolen, sir.

243
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:14,151
Wow! Great reflexes!

244
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:17,196
- Thanks.
- No problem.

245
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,201
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

246
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:24,620
You just get contacts?

247
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:33,545
Well, see you.

248
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:18,841
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

249
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:20,676
Did you see that?

250
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:23,929
Parker?

251
00:23:55,794 --> 00:23:58,213
- It's a fight!
- Think you're funny?

252
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,383
- It was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.

253
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:04,303
- Flash, stop.
- I don't want to fight you.

254
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,890
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

255
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:28,118
Help him, Harry.

256
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:34,583
How'd he do that?

257
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:36,919
Which one?

258
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:38,462
He's all yours, man.

259
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:55,687
Flash, get up!

260
00:24:57,314 --> 00:25:00,442
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

261
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:03,862
That was amazing.

262
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,782
I'm out of here. Come on.

263
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,013
Go, web!

264
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:56,225
Fly.

265
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,895
Up, up and away, web.

266
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,898
Shazam!

267
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:04,733
Go! Go!

268
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:06,735
Go, web, go!

269
00:27:39,852 --> 00:27:41,603
Tallyho.

270
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:28,108
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

271
00:28:28,317 --> 00:28:29,568
Bring me some beer.

272
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:32,321
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...

273
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:33,989
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

274
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:36,492
You're as stupid as your mother.

275
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,954
Where's she going?
Where you going?

276
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:45,375
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

277
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:48,879
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

278
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:53,217
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

279
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:55,928
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

280
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:59,515
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

281
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:02,434
I guess you can always hear us.

282
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:04,895
Everybody shouts.

283
00:29:05,354 --> 00:29:07,481
Your aunt and uncle don't.

284
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:10,192
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

285
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,823
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

286
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:17,699
You really freaked us out.

287
00:29:17,908 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

288
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:24,415
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

289
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:30,712
So where are you going
after you graduate?

290
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,761
I wanna move into the city.

291
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,475
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

292
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:46,478
Work my way through college.

293
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,814
What about you?

294
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,983
Headed for the city too.

295
00:29:51,692 --> 00:29:53,944
Can't wait to get out of here.

296
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:56,613
I wanna...

297
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,366
What?

298
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:04,455
No, come on. Try me.

299
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:06,874
I wanna...

300
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,334
...act...

301
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:12,004
...on-stage.

302
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:14,423
Really?

303
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:16,967
Oh, that's perfect.

304
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:19,803
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

305
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:21,972
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:25,601
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

307
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,312
Peter, that was first grade.

308
00:30:28,812 --> 00:30:30,314
Well...

309
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:32,357
...even so.

310
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:35,277
Sometimes...

311
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:37,780
...you know people.

312
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:42,534
You can just see what's coming.

313
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:48,373
What do you see coming for you?

314
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,628
I don't know.

315
00:30:54,963 --> 00:30:59,635
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

316
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:06,141
And what for me?

317
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:07,643
For you?

318
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:11,814
You're gonna light up Broadway.

319
00:31:13,315 --> 00:31:14,650
You know...

320
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:21,657
...you're taller than you look.

321
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:23,367
I hunch.

322
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,121
Don't.

323
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:34,211
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

324
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:36,588
Come on.

325
00:31:37,673 --> 00:31:39,007
I gotta go.

326
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:41,009
Bye.

327
00:31:41,677 --> 00:31:44,346
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.

328
00:31:44,513 --> 00:31:46,515
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

329
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:48,934
Oh, my God. What a cool car!

330
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:50,769
Pretty tight, huh?

331
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:55,524
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

332
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:58,527
Cool car.

333
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,288
What's going on in there?

334
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:36,125
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

335
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:39,962
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

336
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:42,339
Okay. Thanks.

337
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:16,498
Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.

338
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:19,334
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

339
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:22,171
I just don't know anymore.

340
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:25,132
I'm going to the library.
See you later.

341
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,719
- Wait. I'll drive you there.
- I'll take the train.

342
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:32,139
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

343
00:34:43,192 --> 00:34:46,653
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait. We need to talk.

344
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,200
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

345
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:54,328
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

346
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:58,540
We haven't talked for so long.
May and I don't know who you are.

347
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:03,712
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

348
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:08,008
- You start fights at school.
- I told you I didn't start that fight.

349
00:35:08,217 --> 00:35:11,178
- You sure finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?

350
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:14,390
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

351
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:19,103
You're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

352
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:21,313
No. Not exactly.

353
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:25,401
These are the years
when a man changes...

354
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:29,571
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

355
00:35:29,738 --> 00:35:32,825
Just be careful who you change into.

356
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:38,872
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably des<i>erve</i>d what happened.

357
00:35:39,415 --> 00:35:42,126
But just because you can
beat him up...

358
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:44,837
...doesn't give you the right to.

359
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:50,759
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

360
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:56,348
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

361
00:35:56,515 --> 00:35:59,935
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.

362
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:04,440
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father.

363
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:07,443
Then stop pretending to be!

364
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,781
Right.

365
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:17,703
I'll pick you up here at 10.

366
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:49,443
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

367
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:51,612
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

368
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:54,782
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

369
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:03,540
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

370
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:09,880
Ladies and gentlemen...

371
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:14,593
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

372
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,350
For $3000...

373
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:25,145
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

374
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:30,025
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

375
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:34,696
Who?

376
00:37:34,947 --> 00:37:36,824
I know who.

377
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:41,829
The Flying Dutchman!

378
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:43,622
Next.

379
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:47,751
There's no featherweight
division here. Next.

380
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:49,753
No, no. Sign me up.

381
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,590
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

382
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:57,970
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?

383
00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:01,306
And you're participating
under your own free will?

384
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:05,519
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

385
00:38:08,105 --> 00:38:10,357
Told you! Told you!

386
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:12,359
Winner!

387
00:38:12,568 --> 00:38:13,777
Next victim!

388
00:38:15,654 --> 00:38:18,532
Are you ready for more?

389
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:23,245
Bone Saw is ready!

390
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:30,335
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

391
00:38:30,544 --> 00:38:35,257
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

392
00:38:35,507 --> 00:38:39,887
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

393
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:43,766
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

394
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:46,727
That's it? That's the best you got?

395
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:49,021
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

396
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:53,692
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

397
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:57,112
...the terrifying, the deadly...

398
00:38:57,362 --> 00:39:00,574
...the amazing Spider- Man!

399
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:05,579
- It's "The Human Spider."
- Get out there.

400
00:39:05,746 --> 00:39:08,791
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.

401
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:13,837
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

402
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:16,131
I hope you brought your mommy.

403
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:20,552
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

404
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:26,225
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

405
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:28,769
Oh, my God!

406
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:30,604
Oh, my legs!

407
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:33,399
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

408
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:35,567
Kill! Kill! Kill!

409
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:45,327
Cage! Cage! Cage!

410
00:39:45,494 --> 00:39:46,703
Cage!

411
00:39:56,046 --> 00:39:57,506
Hello? Guys?

412
00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:03,512
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

413
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:08,517
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

414
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:12,187
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

415
00:40:12,396 --> 00:40:14,189
Hey, freak show!

416
00:40:14,398 --> 00:40:17,025
You're going nowhere.

417
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:19,570
I got you for three minutes.

418
00:40:19,737 --> 00:40:22,030
Three minutes of playtime.

419
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:32,124
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

420
00:40:32,332 --> 00:40:36,378
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

421
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:43,594
Finish him off!

422
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:52,311
Smash him!

423
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:01,236
- Hit him!
- Harder!

424
00:41:03,238 --> 00:41:05,574
Kick his spider ass!

425
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:08,744
Hit him!

426
00:41:22,174 --> 00:41:23,967
One, two, three!

427
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:26,970
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

428
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:32,226
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider- Man!

429
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:51,286
Now get out of here.

430
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:55,749
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

431
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:58,335
Well, check it again, webhead.

432
00:41:58,502 --> 00:42:02,381
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

433
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:05,968
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

434
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:07,511
I need that money.

435
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,056
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

436
00:42:19,148 --> 00:42:22,484
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

437
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,654
Hurry up!

438
00:42:31,994 --> 00:42:34,079
Hey! He stole the gate!

439
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:36,206
Stop that guy!

440
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:39,042
Stop him! He's got my money!

441
00:42:39,251 --> 00:42:40,502
Thanks.

442
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:44,131
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!

443
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:46,550
Cut him off and call the cops!

444
00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:50,763
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.

445
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:54,308
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

446
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:13,911
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

447
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:15,621
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

448
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:18,248
Old dude, man.

449
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:22,628
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

450
00:43:22,795 --> 00:43:25,631
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

451
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:31,220
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

452
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,555
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

453
00:43:35,724 --> 00:43:38,352
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

454
00:43:38,477 --> 00:43:42,022
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

455
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:43,607
Uncle Ben?

456
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,026
Uncle Ben.

457
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,115
Uncle Ben?

458
00:43:54,743 --> 00:43:56,245
Peter.

459
00:43:57,121 --> 00:43:58,914
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

460
00:44:04,545 --> 00:44:05,754
Peter.

461
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:30,779
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

462
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:35,701
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

463
00:47:12,816 --> 00:47:14,735
Get a unit to the rear!

464
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,323
I got the back!

465
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:33,587
Who's there?

466
00:47:59,863 --> 00:48:02,991
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

467
00:48:03,158 --> 00:48:07,663
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

468
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,331
Answer me!

469
00:48:12,668 --> 00:48:14,002
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

470
00:48:19,466 --> 00:48:21,176
<i>Thanks.</i>

471
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:32,187
See you.

472
00:48:53,876 --> 00:48:57,337
<i>Freeze! We've got the place</i>
<i>completely surrounded.</i>

473
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:42,508
Oh, no. My God.

474
00:49:44,385 --> 00:49:48,097
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

475
00:49:56,438 --> 00:49:59,400
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

476
00:50:00,192 --> 00:50:03,070
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

477
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:08,659
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

478
00:50:09,368 --> 00:50:12,913
- He's clear! Go!
- You're confident about this test?

479
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,374
Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.

480
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,877
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

481
00:50:19,044 --> 00:50:22,965
Nothing would please me more
than to put Osborn out of business.

482
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,345
Preflight complete. Mark.

483
00:50:32,474 --> 00:50:35,102
<i>An unidentified object</i>
<i>is closing fast.</i>

484
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,353
What's that?

485
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,021
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

486
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,857
Oh, my God!

487
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:52,995
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

488
00:50:53,495 --> 00:50:55,372
Peter!

489
00:50:55,581 --> 00:51:00,127
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

490
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:03,797
Dad got the place in New York,
so we're all set for fall.

491
00:51:03,964 --> 00:51:05,507
- Great!
- You made it.

492
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,597
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

493
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:15,184
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

494
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:18,187
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

495
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:19,897
Yeah.

496
00:51:22,858 --> 00:51:26,236
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

497
00:51:26,403 --> 00:51:29,656
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

498
00:51:29,865 --> 00:51:31,408
Commencement:

499
00:51:31,575 --> 00:51:35,704
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

500
00:51:37,539 --> 00:51:41,210
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

501
00:51:42,086 --> 00:51:43,962
You know what? Whatever.

502
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:45,964
Your loss.

503
00:51:46,673 --> 00:51:50,219
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

504
00:51:50,386 --> 00:51:54,223
And if you ever need anything,
give me a call.

505
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:10,364
Can I fix you something?

506
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:12,032
No, thanks.

507
00:52:56,785 --> 00:52:58,996
I missed him a lot today.

508
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:03,083
I know.

509
00:53:04,835 --> 00:53:06,670
I miss him too.

510
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,758
But he was there.

511
00:53:13,927 --> 00:53:19,141
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

512
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:24,354
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

513
00:53:26,106 --> 00:53:28,192
You loved him...

514
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32,112
...and he loved you.

515
00:53:32,988 --> 00:53:36,658
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

516
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:40,287
How you were meant for great things.

517
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:43,165
You won't disappoint him.

518
00:54:16,698 --> 00:54:20,869
<i>With great power</i>
<i>comes great responsibility.</i>

519
00:54:21,036 --> 00:54:24,248
<i>Remember that, Pete. Remember that.</i>

520
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:35,509
Hurry up!

521
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:51,650
He's not a man. My brother saw him
build a nest in Lincoln Center.

522
00:54:51,817 --> 00:54:55,028
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

523
00:54:59,116 --> 00:55:01,869
Bobby. Get a load of this!

524
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:09,293
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out, and he climbs up them.

525
00:55:09,585 --> 00:55:13,714
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider- Man was here.

526
00:55:13,881 --> 00:55:16,508
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

527
00:55:16,675 --> 00:55:19,428
Some kind of freakyloo or something.

528
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:21,638
He stinks and I don't like him.

529
00:55:22,347 --> 00:55:23,932
Don't move, lady!

530
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:34,777
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

531
00:55:34,985 --> 00:55:37,112
Those tights and that tight little...

532
00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:40,616
<i>Dresses like a spider</i>
<i>He looks like a bug</i>

533
00:55:40,824 --> 00:55:44,578
<i>But we should all just give him</i>
<i>One big hug</i>

534
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:49,374
<i>Look out</i>
<i>Here comes the Spider-Man</i>

535
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:56,799
"Who is Spider- Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

536
00:55:56,965 --> 00:55:59,093
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

537
00:55:59,093 --> 00:55:59,968
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

538
00:55:59,968 --> 00:56:00,969
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

539
00:56:00,969 --> 00:56:01,470
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>

540
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:02,471
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>

541
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:04,306
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.

542
00:56:04,306 --> 00:56:06,642
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.

543
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:08,352
- Well?
- He's news.

544
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,063
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.

545
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:15,234
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.

546
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:19,571
Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.

547
00:56:19,738 --> 00:56:23,700
He's probably going to save
somebody else. He's a hero!

548
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:26,662
Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?

549
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:29,873
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille.

550
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,501
- Whichever's cheaper.
- It's like this:

551
00:56:32,668 --> 00:56:36,505
We double- booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have...

552
00:56:36,672 --> 00:56:39,842
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

553
00:56:40,008 --> 00:56:41,218
Every copy.

554
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,597
Tomorrow, Spider- Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.

555
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:48,684
- That's a problem.
- Then make it page eight.

556
00:56:48,851 --> 00:56:50,519
- That can't be done.
- Get out!

557
00:56:50,686 --> 00:56:55,566
We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's
on it, but we can barely see him.

558
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:57,860
Aw, what is he, shy?

559
00:56:58,026 --> 00:57:02,030
If we can get Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

560
00:57:02,197 --> 00:57:05,617
On the front page:
"Cash for a Spider- Man picture."

561
00:57:05,784 --> 00:57:09,246
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

562
00:57:21,717 --> 00:57:23,135
Buzz off.

563
00:57:23,844 --> 00:57:26,805
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!

564
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:33,395
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

565
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:37,608
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?

566
00:57:37,775 --> 00:57:38,817
Yeah.

567
00:57:39,026 --> 00:57:42,905
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

568
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:44,239
That's great.

569
00:57:44,823 --> 00:57:48,035
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!

570
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:49,828
Your drawer was short $6!

571
00:57:49,995 --> 00:57:52,623
Next time, I'll take it
from your check.

572
00:57:53,707 --> 00:57:57,503
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

573
00:57:57,711 --> 00:58:00,005
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

574
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:04,301
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

575
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:12,976
Some dream, huh?

576
00:58:13,852 --> 00:58:16,480
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

577
00:58:16,647 --> 00:58:19,441
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

578
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:24,446
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

579
00:58:24,863 --> 00:58:26,448
Oh, yeah. Right.

580
00:58:26,698 --> 00:58:29,785
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

581
00:58:29,952 --> 00:58:34,373
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

582
00:58:34,706 --> 00:58:39,044
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

583
00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:42,464
No, I guess not.

584
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:49,054
Thanks, Pete.

585
00:58:50,472 --> 00:58:52,391
We should catch up sometime.

586
00:58:56,603 --> 00:58:59,148
Let's get some lunch some evening.

587
00:59:00,399 --> 00:59:04,903
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

588
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:07,823
- And I won't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry.

589
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,241
I won't.

590
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,162
I won't tell Harry.

591
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:26,925
Timing's perfect. Hey.

592
00:59:27,134 --> 00:59:30,429
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

593
00:59:32,556 --> 00:59:35,267
Norman's making his weekly inspection.

594
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,312
Spent half of it on the phone.

595
00:59:38,896 --> 00:59:43,609
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

596
00:59:44,443 --> 00:59:45,736
Are you all right?

597
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:51,617
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

598
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:55,871
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

599
00:59:56,038 --> 00:59:57,581
You were late again?

600
00:59:58,207 --> 01:00:02,169
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

601
01:00:02,336 --> 01:00:03,587
Around.

602
01:00:03,754 --> 01:00:05,464
Peter Parker.

603
01:00:05,798 --> 01:00:08,300
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who?

604
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:11,553
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

605
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:13,597
When do I get to meet her?

606
01:00:13,764 --> 01:00:17,059
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

607
01:00:19,937 --> 01:00:23,190
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

608
01:00:23,399 --> 01:00:26,235
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

609
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:30,739
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- I'll make a few calls.

610
01:00:30,906 --> 01:00:35,202
I couldn't accept it. I like to earn
what I get. I'll find work.

611
01:00:35,411 --> 01:00:37,037
I respect that.

612
01:00:37,746 --> 01:00:39,873
You want to make it on your own.

613
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:41,875
That's great.

614
01:00:42,751 --> 01:00:45,087
What other skills do you have?

615
01:00:45,295 --> 01:00:47,423
I was thinking about photography.

616
01:00:50,384 --> 01:00:51,635
Hello.

617
01:00:53,554 --> 01:00:55,848
Let's go! Move it!

618
01:00:57,015 --> 01:00:58,684
Watch the street!

619
01:01:14,116 --> 01:01:15,492
Cheese!

620
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:25,711
They're crap.

621
01:01:25,919 --> 01:01:28,881
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

622
01:01:29,089 --> 01:01:32,259
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.

623
01:01:32,468 --> 01:01:34,219
Take them somewhere else.

624
01:01:34,636 --> 01:01:38,724
<i>- Your wife says the tile's out of stock.</i>
- We'll put a rug there.

625
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:41,060
Sit down. Give me that.

626
01:01:42,644 --> 01:01:45,189
Give you 300.
That's the standard fee.

627
01:01:45,355 --> 01:01:47,691
- Scrap page one. Run that.
- Headline?

628
01:01:47,983 --> 01:01:51,195
"Spider- Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Photos."

629
01:01:51,361 --> 01:01:54,490
- Menace? He was protecting...
- You take the photos...

630
01:01:54,698 --> 01:01:57,367
...l'll make up the headlines. Okay?

631
01:01:57,534 --> 01:01:59,536
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

632
01:01:59,995 --> 01:02:03,499
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

633
01:02:03,957 --> 01:02:06,752
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

634
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,587
Best thing for you.

635
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:13,092
You bring me more shots of that clown,
maybe I'll buy them.

636
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,261
But I never said you have a job. Meat.

637
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:20,724
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.

638
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:23,519
- Hi.
- Hi.

639
01:02:23,727 --> 01:02:27,147
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

640
01:02:28,232 --> 01:02:31,360
- Welcome to th<i>e Daily Bugle</i>.
- Thank you.

641
01:02:31,902 --> 01:02:33,278
I'm Peter Parker.

642
01:02:35,781 --> 01:02:37,950
I'm a photographer.

643
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:41,286
Yes. I can see that.

644
01:02:49,002 --> 01:02:50,838
As of today...

645
01:02:51,004 --> 01:02:55,008
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

646
01:02:55,259 --> 01:02:59,680
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

647
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:02,683
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

648
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:06,019
...costs are down, revenues are up...

649
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:09,106
...and our stock
has never been higher.

650
01:03:09,273 --> 01:03:13,694
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

651
01:03:14,528 --> 01:03:15,779
What?

652
01:03:15,988 --> 01:03:21,118
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

653
01:03:21,368 --> 01:03:24,121
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

654
01:03:24,288 --> 01:03:25,456
Why wasn't I told?

655
01:03:25,622 --> 01:03:29,710
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

656
01:03:30,002 --> 01:03:32,296
The deal is off if you come with it.

657
01:03:32,463 --> 01:03:35,883
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

658
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:38,052
You can't do this to me.

659
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:43,515
I started this company.

660
01:03:44,558 --> 01:03:46,977
You know how much I sacrificed?!

661
01:03:50,814 --> 01:03:56,278
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

662
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:00,824
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

663
01:04:00,991 --> 01:04:02,493
I'm sorry.

664
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:05,621
You're out, Norman.

665
01:04:15,506 --> 01:04:17,007
Am I?

666
01:04:20,803 --> 01:04:21,470
<i>Welcome to OSCORP Industries</i>
<i>Unity Day Festival.</i>

667
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,972
<i>Welcome to OSCORP Industries</i>

672
01:05:04,138 --> 01:05:07,683
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

673
01:05:08,726 --> 01:05:12,396
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

674
01:05:12,563 --> 01:05:17,109
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

675
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:20,028
I think you're beautiful.

676
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:36,086
I forgot my drink inside.

677
01:05:46,305 --> 01:05:48,432
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

678
01:05:49,516 --> 01:05:54,688
- Have you seen my father?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

679
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,203
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

680
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,376
What is that?

681
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:17,461
That's our glider!

682
01:06:27,846 --> 01:06:29,306
What the hell was that?

683
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:59,128
Code three!

684
01:07:15,144 --> 01:07:17,312
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

685
01:07:23,277 --> 01:07:26,739
Harry! Help me! Harry!

686
01:07:32,703 --> 01:07:34,455
Out, am I?

687
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:42,212
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

688
01:07:44,214 --> 01:07:46,091
Hello, my dear.

689
01:07:47,092 --> 01:07:48,927
It's Spider- Man!

690
01:08:00,439 --> 01:08:02,399
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!

691
01:08:05,903 --> 01:08:08,238
Somebody help him!

692
01:08:08,447 --> 01:08:10,491
No!

693
01:08:11,492 --> 01:08:13,035
Mommy!

694
01:08:15,037 --> 01:08:16,997
- Hold it!
- I surrender.

695
01:08:17,581 --> 01:08:20,084
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

696
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:27,132
Lmpressive.

697
01:08:51,407 --> 01:08:54,868
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

698
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:21,270
Hold on!

699
01:09:22,896 --> 01:09:23,939
Watch out!

700
01:09:33,073 --> 01:09:36,869
We'll meet again, Spider- Man!

701
01:10:22,373 --> 01:10:25,042
Well, beats taking the subway.

702
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:28,504
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

703
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:29,797
Wait.

704
01:10:29,963 --> 01:10:31,215
Who are you?

705
01:10:31,382 --> 01:10:33,967
- You know who I am.
- I do?

706
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:36,804
Your friendly neighborhood Spider- Man.

707
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:52,403
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

708
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:57,241
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'll come over.

709
01:10:57,908 --> 01:10:59,576
No, I'm gonna come...

710
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:03,330
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

711
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:06,500
And we'll go and have breakfast and...

712
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:08,961
...I want to buy you something.

713
01:11:09,128 --> 01:11:12,464
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

714
01:11:13,507 --> 01:11:17,177
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

715
01:11:20,013 --> 01:11:22,391
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

716
01:11:22,558 --> 01:11:24,309
Don't let the bedbugs...

717
01:11:29,982 --> 01:11:33,026
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

718
01:11:34,737 --> 01:11:38,365
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

719
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,369
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

720
01:11:42,536 --> 01:11:45,581
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

721
01:11:46,665 --> 01:11:48,167
You're right.

722
01:11:49,084 --> 01:11:50,586
I didn't.

723
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:57,009
I'm gonna get some rest.

724
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,512
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

725
01:12:01,597 --> 01:12:03,348
What was that thing?

726
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:05,267
I don't know.

727
01:12:06,685 --> 01:12:10,064
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

728
01:12:25,954 --> 01:12:27,456
Somebody there?

729
01:12:27,456 --> 01:12:28,248
<i>Somebody.</i>

730
01:12:28,248 --> 01:12:29,917
<i>Somebody.</i>

731
01:12:31,251 --> 01:12:32,795
Who said that?

732
01:12:33,462 --> 01:12:36,799
<i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>

733
01:12:39,259 --> 01:12:41,929
<i>You've known all along.</i>

734
01:12:45,933 --> 01:12:47,309
Where are you?

735
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:51,522
<i>Follow the cold shiver</i>
<i>running down your spine.</i>

736
01:12:58,404 --> 01:13:00,239
<i>I'm right here.</i>

737
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:03,992
I don't understand.

738
01:13:04,993 --> 01:13:08,163
Did you think it was coincidence?

739
01:13:08,414 --> 01:13:11,959
So many good things,
all happening for you.

740
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:15,796
All for you. Norman.

741
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,758
What do you want?

742
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,344
To say what you won't.

743
01:13:22,636 --> 01:13:25,180
To do what you can't.

744
01:13:25,347 --> 01:13:29,935
To remove those in your way.

745
01:13:33,897 --> 01:13:35,858
The board members.

746
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:38,527
You killed them.

747
01:13:38,694 --> 01:13:40,237
We killed them.

748
01:13:40,571 --> 01:13:41,613
We?

749
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:43,365
Remember?

750
01:13:43,532 --> 01:13:46,201
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

751
01:13:48,078 --> 01:13:49,872
The performance enhancers.

752
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:55,335
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

753
01:13:55,544 --> 01:13:59,339
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

754
01:13:59,506 --> 01:14:02,384
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

755
01:14:02,551 --> 01:14:05,054
And it's only the beginning.

756
01:14:06,555 --> 01:14:10,893
There's only one who can stop us.

757
01:14:11,685 --> 01:14:15,064
Or imagine if he joined us.

758
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:23,072
Spider- Man. And the Green Goblin.

759
01:14:23,322 --> 01:14:26,575
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

760
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:29,745
- These weirdos all got to have a name.
- Mr. Jameson...

761
01:14:29,912 --> 01:14:31,580
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

762
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:36,543
Copyright "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

763
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:39,046
How about "Green Meanie"?

764
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:42,091
Spider- Man wasn't attacking.
That's slander.

765
01:14:42,257 --> 01:14:44,593
It is not. I resent that.

766
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:47,596
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

767
01:14:47,763 --> 01:14:49,431
You don't trust anybody.

768
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:51,642
I trust my barber.

769
01:14:52,476 --> 01:14:53,977
Are you his lawyer?

770
01:14:54,186 --> 01:14:58,941
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...

771
01:15:06,448 --> 01:15:09,576
Jameson, you slime.

772
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:13,080
Who takes the pictures of Spider- Man?

773
01:15:13,288 --> 01:15:16,208
- I don't know. His stuff comes by mail.
- Liar!

774
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:19,378
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.

775
01:15:19,545 --> 01:15:22,464
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

776
01:15:22,673 --> 01:15:24,925
Set him down, tough guy.

777
01:15:25,175 --> 01:15:29,763
- Speak of the devil.
- I knew you two were in this together!

778
01:15:29,972 --> 01:15:32,558
Kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute.

779
01:15:32,766 --> 01:15:35,227
Sleep...

780
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:53,704
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

781
01:15:53,871 --> 01:15:58,292
No, you're not dead yet.

782
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,669
Just paralyzed...

783
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:02,796
...temporarily.

784
01:16:03,797 --> 01:16:06,884
You're an amazing creature,
Spider- Man.

785
01:16:07,092 --> 01:16:09,762
You and I are not so different.

786
01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:13,807
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

787
01:16:14,016 --> 01:16:16,894
Well, to each his own.

788
01:16:17,061 --> 01:16:20,022
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

789
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:25,319
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

790
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:28,781
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

791
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:32,576
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

792
01:16:32,743 --> 01:16:37,289
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

793
01:16:37,498 --> 01:16:38,540
Why bother?

794
01:16:38,749 --> 01:16:43,462
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

795
01:16:43,879 --> 01:16:46,882
There are eight million people
in this city.

796
01:16:47,091 --> 01:16:51,387
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

797
01:16:51,595 --> 01:16:55,557
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

798
01:16:55,724 --> 01:16:57,142
You, me...

799
01:16:57,726 --> 01:16:59,645
...we're exceptional.

800
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:04,566
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

801
01:17:04,775 --> 01:17:08,445
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

802
01:17:08,612 --> 01:17:12,199
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

803
01:17:12,408 --> 01:17:15,160
What we could create.

804
01:17:15,744 --> 01:17:17,746
Or we could destroy.

805
01:17:17,913 --> 01:17:21,875
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

806
01:17:22,084 --> 01:17:26,964
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?

807
01:17:28,966 --> 01:17:31,844
Think about it, hero.

808
01:17:43,814 --> 01:17:49,153
<i>In spite of everything you've done for</i>
<i>them, eventually, they will hate you.</i>

809
01:17:59,496 --> 01:18:00,956
It's me again.

810
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:02,750
How was your audition?

811
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:05,961
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...

812
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:08,088
...told my aunt, told me.

813
01:18:08,547 --> 01:18:09,882
So you just came by?

814
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:13,719
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

815
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:18,474
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

816
01:18:18,724 --> 01:18:20,225
So how'd it go?

817
01:18:22,394 --> 01:18:24,980
They said I needed acting lessons.

818
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:28,901
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

819
01:18:29,068 --> 01:18:34,406
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

820
01:18:35,741 --> 01:18:37,826
I'd like a cheeseburger.

821
01:18:38,285 --> 01:18:41,747
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

822
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:43,582
Come with us.

823
01:18:43,749 --> 01:18:46,502
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

824
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,923
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

825
01:18:51,423 --> 01:18:52,925
It's not?

826
01:18:54,343 --> 01:18:56,011
Why so interested?

827
01:18:56,678 --> 01:18:58,180
I'm not.

828
01:18:58,430 --> 01:18:59,807
You're not?

829
01:19:01,433 --> 01:19:04,186
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

830
01:19:04,436 --> 01:19:06,230
Why would you be?

831
01:19:08,107 --> 01:19:10,442
I, that's a...

832
01:19:10,651 --> 01:19:12,152
I don't know.

833
01:19:14,363 --> 01:19:17,199
Sorry you won't come with us.

834
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,620
I'd better run, tiger.

835
01:19:30,337 --> 01:19:32,339
Hey, check it out, man.

836
01:19:32,506 --> 01:19:34,174
Come on, man.

837
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,973
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

838
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:00,325
Get off me!

839
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:35,110
Wait!

840
01:20:39,948 --> 01:20:42,326
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

841
01:20:42,493 --> 01:20:46,872
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

842
01:20:47,081 --> 01:20:48,957
I was in the neighborhood.

843
01:20:50,834 --> 01:20:53,462
You are amazing.

844
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:57,132
Some people don't think so.

845
01:20:58,217 --> 01:21:01,220
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

846
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:05,182
Do I get to say thank you this time?

847
01:21:06,058 --> 01:21:07,559
Wait.

848
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:18,672
Let me in! My baby's in there!

849
01:22:18,839 --> 01:22:20,966
- Let me go!
- The roof's collapsing!

850
01:22:21,133 --> 01:22:24,636
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!

851
01:22:24,845 --> 01:22:26,180
Look! Up there!

852
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,605
Save my baby, please!

853
01:22:58,337 --> 01:22:59,463
No!

854
01:23:07,221 --> 01:23:11,225
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

855
01:23:12,267 --> 01:23:15,187
God bless you, Spider- Man.
Bless you.

856
01:23:15,396 --> 01:23:17,147
Don't let him get away!

857
01:23:17,356 --> 01:23:20,609
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

858
01:23:20,776 --> 01:23:24,113
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

859
01:23:25,572 --> 01:23:26,907
I'm going.

860
01:23:28,575 --> 01:23:31,620
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back.

861
01:23:32,037 --> 01:23:33,163
Go! Go!

862
01:23:42,089 --> 01:23:43,799
Where are you?

863
01:23:45,843 --> 01:23:47,428
Where are you?

864
01:23:52,808 --> 01:23:55,185
I'm gonna get you out of here!

865
01:23:57,771 --> 01:23:59,273
It's okay.

866
01:24:06,321 --> 01:24:08,907
You're pathetically predictable.

867
01:24:09,074 --> 01:24:10,993
Like a moth to the flame.

868
01:24:11,869 --> 01:24:14,329
What about my generous proposal?

869
01:24:15,372 --> 01:24:18,208
Are you in or are you out?

870
01:24:18,417 --> 01:24:24,339
- It's you who's out. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.

871
01:24:24,757 --> 01:24:26,258
Oh, great.

872
01:25:04,922 --> 01:25:07,716
No one says no to me!

873
01:25:15,057 --> 01:25:18,477
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

874
01:25:20,979 --> 01:25:22,231
He's here.

875
01:25:23,023 --> 01:25:24,525
Are you ready?

876
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:29,029
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

877
01:25:29,238 --> 01:25:32,324
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

878
01:25:32,533 --> 01:25:35,953
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

879
01:25:36,203 --> 01:25:38,914
Who is this lovely young lady?

880
01:25:39,081 --> 01:25:43,377
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

881
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:46,255
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

882
01:25:46,463 --> 01:25:50,175
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

883
01:25:50,342 --> 01:25:52,720
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.

884
01:25:58,475 --> 01:26:02,062
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

885
01:26:05,065 --> 01:26:06,567
Peter?

886
01:26:14,616 --> 01:26:16,326
Is that you?

887
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:25,961
How strange. There's nobody here.

888
01:26:32,426 --> 01:26:36,889
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

889
01:27:09,505 --> 01:27:12,132
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

890
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:14,051
It's a jungle out there.

891
01:27:14,218 --> 01:27:18,138
Had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

892
01:27:18,597 --> 01:27:21,433
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

893
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,185
...and we can say grace.

894
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:28,482
Here we go.

895
01:27:35,447 --> 01:27:37,783
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.

896
01:27:41,578 --> 01:27:43,872
Will you do the honors?

897
01:27:55,551 --> 01:27:58,804
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

898
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:06,979
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

899
01:28:07,146 --> 01:28:08,689
Well, let me see.

900
01:28:08,897 --> 01:28:10,399
Oh, my goodness.

901
01:28:10,649 --> 01:28:13,068
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

902
01:28:13,235 --> 01:28:16,363
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

903
01:28:16,572 --> 01:28:21,869
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.

904
01:28:22,828 --> 01:28:25,914
How did you say that happened?

905
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:28,042
Bike messenger.

906
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:30,210
Knocked me down.

907
01:28:35,591 --> 01:28:39,261
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?

908
01:28:40,179 --> 01:28:43,557
Something has come to my attention.

909
01:28:43,766 --> 01:28:45,017
Are you all right?

910
01:28:45,225 --> 01:28:48,729
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

911
01:28:49,354 --> 01:28:51,732
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!

912
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:57,696
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

913
01:28:57,905 --> 01:28:59,573
I've got to go.

914
01:28:59,907 --> 01:29:04,036
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

915
01:29:04,244 --> 01:29:08,207
Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personality?

916
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:11,460
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful.

917
01:29:11,627 --> 01:29:17,049
They're all beautiful until they're
snarling after your money like wolves.

918
01:29:17,257 --> 01:29:18,509
You're wrong, Dad.

919
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:22,262
A word to the not-so-wise
about your girlfriend:

920
01:29:22,429 --> 01:29:26,308
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

921
01:29:36,693 --> 01:29:39,238
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

922
01:29:39,446 --> 01:29:42,408
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

923
01:29:42,616 --> 01:29:46,495
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

924
01:29:46,745 --> 01:29:49,081
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

925
01:29:49,248 --> 01:29:50,916
Harry Osborn!

926
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,044
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

927
01:29:57,005 --> 01:30:00,342
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

928
01:30:00,509 --> 01:30:03,637
<i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>

929
01:30:03,846 --> 01:30:05,180
I can't.

930
01:30:05,347 --> 01:30:08,350
<i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>

931
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,853
<i>Parker must be educated.</i>

932
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:14,314
What do I do?

933
01:30:14,523 --> 01:30:18,610
<i>Instruct him in the matters</i>
<i>of loss and pain.</i>

934
01:30:18,777 --> 01:30:21,822
<i>Make him suffer.</i>
<i>Make him wish he were dead.</i>

935
01:30:22,072 --> 01:30:23,365
Yes?

936
01:30:23,532 --> 01:30:25,451
<i>And then grant his wish.</i>

937
01:30:26,368 --> 01:30:27,661
But how?

938
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:32,166
<i>The cunning warrior attacks</i>
<i>neither body nor mind.</i>

939
01:30:32,374 --> 01:30:33,542
Tell me how!

940
01:30:33,709 --> 01:30:35,878
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

941
01:30:36,128 --> 01:30:39,173
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

942
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:44,553
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

943
01:30:44,762 --> 01:30:47,723
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

944
01:30:47,973 --> 01:30:51,810
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

945
01:30:59,568 --> 01:31:02,112
Deliver us!

946
01:31:02,321 --> 01:31:03,697
Finish it!

947
01:31:03,989 --> 01:31:07,910
- Finish it!
- From evil!

948
01:31:13,624 --> 01:31:15,793
Two milligrams IV.

949
01:31:17,586 --> 01:31:18,837
Get the BP.

950
01:31:19,254 --> 01:31:22,841
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

951
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:24,385
You have to leave.

952
01:31:24,551 --> 01:31:26,261
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

953
01:31:26,428 --> 01:31:30,516
Those horrible yellow eyes!

954
01:31:35,354 --> 01:31:37,898
He knows who I am.

955
01:32:21,859 --> 01:32:23,444
I'm sorry.

956
01:32:27,156 --> 01:32:29,616
- Will she be okay?
- She'll be fine.

957
01:32:29,783 --> 01:32:32,453
She's been sleeping all day.

958
01:32:33,454 --> 01:32:36,206
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

959
01:32:40,377 --> 01:32:43,297
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

960
01:32:43,464 --> 01:32:47,176
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

961
01:32:47,384 --> 01:32:50,345
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

962
01:32:50,804 --> 01:32:52,973
I haven't called him back.

963
01:32:55,059 --> 01:32:56,769
The fact is...

964
01:32:57,936 --> 01:33:00,773
...l'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

965
01:33:00,939 --> 01:33:03,150
At least I think I am.

966
01:33:04,818 --> 01:33:07,863
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.

967
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:11,283
Would I know his name, this guy?

968
01:33:11,492 --> 01:33:14,370
You'll think I'm a little girl
with a crush.

969
01:33:14,536 --> 01:33:15,913
Trust me.

970
01:33:16,163 --> 01:33:17,414
It's funny.

971
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:23,379
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

972
01:33:23,545 --> 01:33:26,924
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

973
01:33:27,132 --> 01:33:30,094
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

974
01:33:30,302 --> 01:33:34,598
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say?

975
01:33:34,765 --> 01:33:37,684
Not Spider- Man,
not a chance in the world.

976
01:33:37,893 --> 01:33:39,520
I know him a little bit.

977
01:33:39,728 --> 01:33:42,606
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

978
01:33:42,815 --> 01:33:45,943
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

979
01:33:46,276 --> 01:33:47,736
What'd he say?

980
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,655
I said...

981
01:33:50,739 --> 01:33:55,035
He asked me what I thought about you.

982
01:33:55,953 --> 01:33:57,996
And what did you say?

983
01:33:58,706 --> 01:34:02,793
I said, "Spider- Man."

984
01:34:03,127 --> 01:34:08,006
I said, "The great thing about M. J...

985
01:34:08,215 --> 01:34:09,758
...is...

986
01:34:10,676 --> 01:34:13,929
...when you look in her eyes...

987
01:34:16,473 --> 01:34:19,685
...and she's looking back in yours...

988
01:34:20,686 --> 01:34:23,689
...everything feels...

989
01:34:24,898 --> 01:34:26,734
...not quite normal.

990
01:34:27,985 --> 01:34:29,778
Because you feel...

991
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,947
...stronger...

992
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:37,119
...and weaker at the same time.

993
01:34:38,162 --> 01:34:40,289
You feel excited...

994
01:34:41,165 --> 01:34:43,208
...and at the same time...

995
01:34:43,834 --> 01:34:45,461
...terrified.

996
01:34:47,796 --> 01:34:52,092
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

997
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:57,139
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

998
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:01,727
It's as if you've...

999
01:35:02,352 --> 01:35:05,522
...reached the unreachable...

1000
01:35:07,107 --> 01:35:09,818
...and you weren't ready for it."

1001
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,032
You said that?

1002
01:35:15,824 --> 01:35:18,160
Well, something like that.

1003
01:36:02,454 --> 01:36:03,956
Dad?

1004
01:36:09,294 --> 01:36:11,380
Dad, is that you?

1005
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:19,471
What is it?

1006
01:36:21,724 --> 01:36:26,729
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

1007
01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:30,441
She's in love with Peter.

1008
01:36:30,733 --> 01:36:32,526
- Parker?
- Yeah.

1009
01:36:32,693 --> 01:36:35,821
And how does he feel about her?

1010
01:36:37,239 --> 01:36:39,783
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1011
01:36:40,743 --> 01:36:45,998
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1012
01:36:48,917 --> 01:36:50,669
I'm so sorry.

1013
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:56,592
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

1014
01:36:58,343 --> 01:37:01,555
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1015
01:37:01,722 --> 01:37:03,557
That's no excuse.

1016
01:37:04,558 --> 01:37:06,351
I'm proud of you.

1017
01:37:06,894 --> 01:37:11,774
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.

1018
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:15,194
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1019
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:31,126
<i>Wake up, little spider.</i>

1020
01:37:31,293 --> 01:37:32,795
Wake up.

1021
01:37:34,129 --> 01:37:35,714
Go home, dear.

1022
01:37:35,923 --> 01:37:37,257
You look awful.

1023
01:37:37,466 --> 01:37:39,760
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1024
01:37:39,927 --> 01:37:43,263
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

1025
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:46,141
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1026
01:37:46,308 --> 01:37:51,855
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1027
01:37:52,606 --> 01:37:54,358
A smile. Finally.

1028
01:37:54,525 --> 01:37:58,862
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

1029
01:37:59,029 --> 01:38:01,323
You were supposed to be asleep.

1030
01:38:02,157 --> 01:38:06,912
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1031
01:38:07,121 --> 01:38:11,125
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1032
01:38:11,333 --> 01:38:17,589
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1033
01:38:17,798 --> 01:38:21,343
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

1034
01:38:24,012 --> 01:38:26,765
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1035
01:38:26,974 --> 01:38:30,728
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1036
01:38:30,936 --> 01:38:35,524
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1037
01:38:35,733 --> 01:38:38,861
You're so mysterious all the time.

1038
01:38:39,111 --> 01:38:41,864
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1039
01:38:42,072 --> 01:38:46,035
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1040
01:38:46,493 --> 01:38:48,912
Everybody else knows.

1041
01:38:51,832 --> 01:38:53,125
I'll be right back.

1042
01:38:53,834 --> 01:38:55,127
But...

1043
01:39:02,468 --> 01:39:04,470
Come on, pick up.

1044
01:39:04,636 --> 01:39:07,931
- Hey M.J.
<i>- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.</i>

1045
01:39:08,974 --> 01:39:11,018
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1046
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:14,146
Hello? You there?

1047
01:39:14,646 --> 01:39:19,151
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1048
01:39:19,318 --> 01:39:20,736
All right, well...

1049
01:39:21,153 --> 01:39:22,196
Don't...

1050
01:39:22,988 --> 01:39:25,199
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1051
01:39:25,407 --> 01:39:26,909
Hello?

1052
01:39:29,328 --> 01:39:33,040
<i>Can Spider-Man come out to play?</i>

1053
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:35,000
Where is she?

1054
01:40:21,255 --> 01:40:22,923
- What is that?
- That's cool!

1055
01:40:23,132 --> 01:40:27,761
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i>
<i>Went up the water spout</i>

1056
01:40:27,928 --> 01:40:32,099
<i>Down came the goblin</i>
<i>And took the spider out</i>

1057
01:40:48,907 --> 01:40:50,659
Goblin, what have you done?

1058
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:36,997
Spider- Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1059
01:41:37,373 --> 01:41:39,041
Because you never know...

1060
01:41:39,208 --> 01:41:43,962
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1061
01:41:45,089 --> 01:41:47,716
Let die the woman you love...

1062
01:41:52,012 --> 01:41:57,101
...or suffer the little children.

1063
01:41:59,478 --> 01:42:01,980
- Spider- Man!
- Save us!

1064
01:42:02,481 --> 01:42:04,775
Save us!

1065
01:42:05,067 --> 01:42:07,653
Make your choice, Spider- Man...

1066
01:42:07,861 --> 01:42:11,240
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1067
01:42:11,407 --> 01:42:13,492
Don't do it, Goblin!

1068
01:42:13,659 --> 01:42:16,578
We are who we choose to be.

1069
01:42:16,829 --> 01:42:19,581
- Now, choose!
- No!

1070
01:42:48,277 --> 01:42:49,862
Everybody stay still!

1071
01:42:59,371 --> 01:43:00,664
Ahoy up there!

1072
01:43:00,831 --> 01:43:03,792
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1073
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:15,429
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1074
01:43:15,596 --> 01:43:17,097
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1075
01:43:22,186 --> 01:43:25,230
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1076
01:43:25,397 --> 01:43:26,982
Trust me.

1077
01:43:28,484 --> 01:43:32,321
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1078
01:43:36,658 --> 01:43:38,702
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

1079
01:43:38,911 --> 01:43:40,579
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1080
01:44:09,024 --> 01:44:11,652
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1081
01:44:21,537 --> 01:44:24,748
It's time to die.

1082
01:44:31,755 --> 01:44:35,592
- I got something for you!
- We ought to kick your ass!

1083
01:44:35,759 --> 01:44:39,179
Leave Spider- Man alone!
You'd pick on a guy saving kids?

1084
01:44:39,847 --> 01:44:43,350
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1085
01:44:43,517 --> 01:44:47,062
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1086
01:44:59,575 --> 01:45:01,368
Spider- Man, watch out!

1087
01:45:33,233 --> 01:45:37,488
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1088
01:45:38,405 --> 01:45:41,033
I offered you friendship...

1089
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,077
...and you spat in my face.

1090
01:46:34,169 --> 01:46:37,840
You've spun your last web, Spider- Man.

1091
01:46:38,006 --> 01:46:41,343
Had you not been so selfish,
your girlfriend's death...

1092
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:43,178
...would have been quick.

1093
01:46:43,345 --> 01:46:46,765
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1094
01:46:47,015 --> 01:46:51,895
...l'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1095
01:46:56,483 --> 01:46:58,527
M.J. And I...

1096
01:46:59,361 --> 01:47:02,656
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1097
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,003
Peter, stop!

1098
01:47:58,170 --> 01:48:00,631
Stop! It's me.

1099
01:48:09,598 --> 01:48:11,100
Mr. Osborn.

1100
01:48:11,266 --> 01:48:12,810
Thank God for you.

1101
01:48:13,018 --> 01:48:15,354
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1102
01:48:15,521 --> 01:48:18,565
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1103
01:48:18,732 --> 01:48:20,484
Don't let him take me again.

1104
01:48:20,651 --> 01:48:22,695
I beg you. Protect me.

1105
01:48:22,861 --> 01:48:26,448
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1106
01:48:26,615 --> 01:48:28,117
But not you.

1107
01:48:28,784 --> 01:48:32,746
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

1108
01:48:32,955 --> 01:48:35,040
I would never hurt you.

1109
01:48:35,249 --> 01:48:37,167
I knew from the beginning...

1110
01:48:37,376 --> 01:48:40,295
...if anything ever happened to me...

1111
01:48:40,462 --> 01:48:42,589
...it was you I could count on.

1112
01:48:42,756 --> 01:48:46,135
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1113
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:48,554
Thank God for you.

1114
01:48:49,555 --> 01:48:50,973
Give me your hand.

1115
01:48:52,141 --> 01:48:55,561
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

1116
01:48:56,979 --> 01:48:59,773
I've been like a father to you.

1117
01:49:01,316 --> 01:49:02,985
Be a son to me now.

1118
01:49:04,778 --> 01:49:06,655
I have a father.

1119
01:49:07,406 --> 01:49:09,908
His name was Ben Parker.

1120
01:49:11,785 --> 01:49:13,245
Godspeed, Spider- Man.

1121
01:49:32,181 --> 01:49:33,682
Peter.

1122
01:49:36,018 --> 01:49:37,853
Don't tell Harry.

1123
01:50:09,551 --> 01:50:11,261
What have you done?

1124
01:50:11,428 --> 01:50:13,013
What have you done?!

1125
01:50:41,166 --> 01:50:43,210
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1126
01:50:44,128 --> 01:50:47,256
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1127
01:50:49,425 --> 01:50:52,720
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1128
01:50:54,304 --> 01:50:56,598
One day Spider- Man will pay.

1129
01:50:58,475 --> 01:51:01,603
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider- Man will pay.

1130
01:51:06,608 --> 01:51:08,444
Thank God for you, Peter.

1131
01:51:09,153 --> 01:51:11,613
You're the only family I have.

1132
01:51:36,138 --> 01:51:38,432
<i>No matter what I do...</i>

1133
01:51:38,599 --> 01:51:41,727
<i>... no matter how hard I try...</i>

1134
01:51:42,311 --> 01:51:46,148
<i>... the ones I love will always</i>
<i>be the ones who pay.</i>

1135
01:51:56,867 --> 01:51:59,203
You must miss him so much.

1136
01:52:00,162 --> 01:52:03,207
It's been so hard without him.

1137
01:52:06,126 --> 01:52:09,004
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1138
01:52:10,798 --> 01:52:12,591
When I was up there...

1139
01:52:13,342 --> 01:52:16,136
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1140
01:52:17,763 --> 01:52:21,600
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1141
01:52:22,893 --> 01:52:26,105
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1142
01:52:27,564 --> 01:52:29,983
It was you, Pete.

1143
01:52:30,859 --> 01:52:32,736
I kept thinking:

1144
01:52:33,153 --> 01:52:35,948
"I hope I make it through this...

1145
01:52:37,408 --> 01:52:41,787
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1146
01:52:43,163 --> 01:52:44,665
Really?

1147
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:50,838
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1148
01:52:52,089 --> 01:52:54,049
...who makes me feel...

1149
01:52:54,508 --> 01:52:58,220
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1150
01:53:00,347 --> 01:53:02,015
That I'm just...

1151
01:53:02,683 --> 01:53:04,184
...me.

1152
01:53:05,269 --> 01:53:07,187
And that's okay.

1153
01:53:09,398 --> 01:53:10,858
The truth is...

1154
01:53:12,985 --> 01:53:14,778
...I love you.

1155
01:53:16,905 --> 01:53:18,824
I love you so much, Peter.

1156
01:53:39,553 --> 01:53:44,308
<i>All I wanted was to tell her</i>
<i>how much I loved her.</i>

1157
01:53:44,475 --> 01:53:46,393
I can't...

1158
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,064
You can't what?

1159
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:52,649
Tell you...

1160
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:58,697
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1161
01:53:59,782 --> 01:54:03,702
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1162
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:06,580
I want you to know...

1163
01:54:06,997 --> 01:54:09,666
...that I will always be there
for you.

1164
01:54:09,875 --> 01:54:13,837
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1165
01:54:14,838 --> 01:54:16,840
I promise you that.

1166
01:54:20,135 --> 01:54:22,429
I will always be your friend.

1167
01:54:25,349 --> 01:54:27,226
Only a friend...

1168
01:54:28,102 --> 01:54:29,645
...Peter Parker?

1169
01:54:31,814 --> 01:54:34,650
That's all I have to give.

1170
01:55:01,009 --> 01:55:03,679
<i>Whatever life holds in store for me...</i>

1171
01:55:03,846 --> 01:55:06,724
...I will never forget these words:

1172
01:55:06,932 --> 01:55:11,979
<i>"With great power</i>
<i>comes great responsibility. "</i>

1173
01:55:12,146 --> 01:55:14,398
<i>This is my gift.</i>

1174
01:55:14,565 --> 01:55:16,692
<i>My curse.</i>

1175
01:55:17,192 --> 01:55:19,111
<i>Who am I?</i>

1176
01:55:19,486 --> 01:55:20,863
<i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>

1177
01:55:21,305 --> 01:56:21,547
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
