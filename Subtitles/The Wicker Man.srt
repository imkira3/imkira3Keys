2
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:27,573
-Thanks, hon.
-You got it.

3
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:38,973
-Boo.
-Hey!

4
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,373
Sorry, my mind was wandering.

5
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:47,213
Totally understand. lf l just ate one
of them burgers, l'd be in a trance too.

6
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:48,813
So where's your friend?

7
00:01:51,573 --> 00:01:52,933
Honey?

8
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:55,413
Your salad's up.

9
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:21,413
Give me your driver's license
and registration.

10
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:26,333
-You know why l stopped you?
-Yeah.

11
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:36,493
Afternoon.

12
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:38,893
Afternoon, sir. Hello.

13
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,613
Sorry about the....

14
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:43,933
We're just in the middle of moving and l--

15
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,173
And l'm sorry.

16
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,333
-Did you get my doll?
-Sweetie, hush.

17
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:50,453
lt's okay.

18
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:53,773
l've got it, honey. lt's a little banged up.

19
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:56,613
Anyway, sorry again.

20
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,733
Ever since lunch, she's been acting out.

21
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,853
-l'm bored.
-Well, l know what that's like.

22
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,773
But we need to be careful with our things
so everyone else can be safe too, right?

23
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,373
-We won't let it happen again, sir.
-Great. Thanks a lot.

24
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:17,693
Sweetie, stop that.

25
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:20,053
l'm so sorry. She's belted in, but--

26
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,493
Don't worry, it comes
with the territory. l'll get it.

27
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,493
Keep your head down!

28
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,933
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

29
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:04,573
-Hey.
-Hey.

30
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:10,573
So.

31
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:13,093
That about sums it up.

32
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:18,813
l heard about your commendation.
That's great.

33
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:20,573
Thanks.

34
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:28,133
Guys down at the station are saying
you might resign or something. ls that true?

35
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:30,653
My dad would kill me.

36
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:38,413
Here. Pete made me bring them over.

37
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:41,853
''Get well soon'' stuff.
l guess it just keeps coming in, so....

38
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,853
-You wanna sit down, or...?
-Yeah.

39
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:11,773
Stuff helping you?

40
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:15,533
Some.

41
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:20,493
You don't have to stay.
l don't really need visitors.

42
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,013
So you gonna shoot
for detective now, or what?

43
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,933
l just need a little time off.

44
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,293
So they still never found
the bodies from that car, right?

45
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:38,933
No.

46
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:42,493
The car wasn't even registered,
if you can believe that.

47
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:45,453
Well, who were they?

48
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,653
Don't know.

49
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:56,253
May never know.

50
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:08,453
Edward, I know that we haven't spoken
in a few years and things ended badly...

51
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:11,893
...or I ended them badly,
to be more fair...

52
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:15,213
...and I didn't wanna hurt you
any more than I did.

53
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,373
Now I must.

54
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,613
To the point. I have a daughter.

55
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:26,973
She is a perfect child,
and her name is Rowan.

56
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:31,813
She has been missing for two weeks now,
and I need your help.

57
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,173
I should explain.

58
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,973
I live on Summersisle,
a tiny place in Puget Sound.

59
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:39,893
I doubt you've heard of it.

60
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:44,493
It is where I grew up. Do you remember
how you always used to ask me?

61
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:46,373
Now you know.

62
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,573
Rowan couldn't have left the island
by herself. She's too young.

63
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:54,413
I have tried to find her on my own...

64
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,413
...but am receiving little help
from the community.

65
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:00,733
I fear she is in danger,
so now I turn to you.

66
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,613
I pray that you'll forgive me.

67
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:06,413
Yours fondly, Willow Woodward.

68
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:14,533
Hello?

69
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:17,653
Hello?

70
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,173
Eddie. How's it going?

71
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,493
Good, thank you.

72
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:38,533
-Hi.
-Hey.

73
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:40,293
-Hey.
-Hey.

74
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:41,453
-How you doing?
-Better.

75
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,493
-Are you back?
-Not for a couple weeks.

76
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:46,493
You didn't see this woman come in,
by any chance?

77
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:49,853
-No, why?
-Because, no stamp.

78
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:52,733
Read it.

79
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,413
The plot thickens.
Didn't even know you had a plot.

80
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:03,733
No kidding.

81
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:06,333
So is this, like,
some old girlfriend or something?

82
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:08,013
This Willow?

83
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:10,493
No, no, she was....

84
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:13,613
-We were engaged.
-What?

85
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,973
We were, you know, close,
and then she took off on me.

86
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:20,893
Yeah. Sounds like she got close
with someone else too.

87
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:24,133
And she's got the nerve
to contact you now? Shit.

88
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,053
l know. l know.
lt's the fact that l'm a cop, l guess.

89
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,533
-We need to be in that briefing.
-Okay.

90
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:34,773
-Hey. lt's good to see you.
-Yeah.

91
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,813
-You're gonna blow this off, right?
-l don't know.

92
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,773
Yeah, l'm pissed off at her.

93
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,173
Come on.

94
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:44,613
You haven't seen this girl in,
like, what? Forever?

95
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:47,493
Her kid's missing, Pete, okay?
l might be all she's got.

96
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,573
Tell her to contact the father.

97
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:52,893
-l'm just saying.
-Yeah, l get it. l'm just--

98
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:56,493
Why don't you do a little digging
on her first? l mean, come on.

99
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:59,333
Summersisle? Where the hell is that?

100
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:01,253
Yeah. This is all l could find.

101
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:04,533
lt's privately owned
out in the Pacific Northwest.

102
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:08,373
lt's some sort of farming commune
or whatever.

103
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,453
Yeah, like the Amish or something.

104
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:13,293
Give her a call.

105
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:16,733
l already tried, but guess what.
There's no phone service on Summersisle.

106
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,813
Summersisle.

107
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:33,733
Hey, Pete, it's me.

108
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:39,253
Hey, l'm glad l got your machine,
because you'll probably laugh at me, but--

109
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,093
Hello?

110
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,133
Hello?

111
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,413
Ahoy there.

112
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,293
What was that?

113
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:03,493
l don't know
what you're supposed to say.

114
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:04,853
Then l'd just go with hello.

115
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:06,493
Right. Hello.

116
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:09,813
You know about a place
called Summersisle?

117
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,373
Yes, l do. l make most
of the deliveries around there.

118
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:14,533
Deliveries, huh?

119
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,853
Yep. Just about every day.
That's what l'm doing now.

120
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:20,053
What would l have to do
to catch a ride?

121
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:24,813
Oh, no. l don't care to lose my contract
with these folks. They're very particular.

122
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,333
All right, then just drop me down
on the beach...

123
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,893
...or whatever they have,
and l'll walk into town.

124
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:31,533
The answer's still no.

125
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:34,413
lt's just a few miles.
l could practically swim that.

126
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,973
You better start swimming, then.

127
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:38,413
Why? What's the big deal?

128
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:42,013
Because it's private.
lt's off-limits, and we respect that.

129
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:44,413
We're all private people around here.

130
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:47,853
Yeah, but you're so warm and open,
it really makes up for it.

131
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,413
l'm just kidding.

132
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:53,053
Okay, look, how about
you take all of us there?

133
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:55,213
What do you mean, ''all''?

134
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:56,613
Well, me...

135
00:13:56,813 --> 00:13:59,453
...Mr. Grant here
and his twin brother Ulysses.

136
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:32,893
Lost your bearings?

137
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:36,333
Oh, hey. Sorry.
You snuck up on me there.

138
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,573
l don't think so.

139
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:41,333
-This is Summersisle, right?
-Yes.

140
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,373
-ln the right place.
-Afraid not. This is private property.

141
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:47,013
You can't land here without permission.

142
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:51,493
Listen, l completely understand,
but l was invited here.

143
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,733
-l'm a cop.
-And what does that mean?

144
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:59,453
A police officer.
l do what l can for people. Help them out.

145
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:03,373
Now, a complaint has been made
by a resident of this island.

146
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:04,533
A complaint, you say?

147
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:06,373
Yes, ma'am. About a missing child.

148
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,933
Well, now, that's always trouble.

149
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,013
Yep. For everybody.

150
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:14,453
Perhaps you should take these matters up
with Sister Summersisle.

151
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,573
She's very particular
about anyone landing here.

152
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:19,973
How did you land here, by the way?

153
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,853
Was it the harbor pilot?

154
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:24,373
He just--

155
00:16:26,373 --> 00:16:27,773
He'll need a good talking-to.

156
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:31,373
What's in the bag?
A shark or something?

157
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,653
Do you know her?

158
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:41,653
l don't recognize this child.

159
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,133
-Do you, Violet?
-No. Can't say l do.

160
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,773
Just a tip there. lt often helps
to actually glance at the photo.

161
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:51,253
What are you telling me?
This girl isn't from the island?

162
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:52,973
Doesn't appear to be.

163
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:55,013
Her mother's name is Willow.

164
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,173
Sister Willow.

165
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:00,613
She quite slipped my mind.

166
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:03,533
Yes, we have a Willow here, all right.

167
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:06,733
-Just up the way at the meetinghouse.
-What a coincidence.

168
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:08,653
Bit of a free spirit.

169
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:11,413
Your bag is dripping.

170
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,333
Go on.

171
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:20,613
Take a peek.

172
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:47,333
That's not her daughter.

173
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:05,093
Must be ladies' night.

174
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:09,693
Hi. Are you the barmaid in here,
or whatever you call it?

175
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:11,733
l'm Sister Beech, yes.

176
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:14,933
And you're that officer from California?

177
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:19,453
That's right. Name is Malus.

178
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:24,133
Edward Malus.
l'd just like a room and a meal.

179
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,413
-Can you swing it?
-Swing what?

180
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:28,493
ls that some kind of city talk?

181
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:33,813
Manage. That's what he means.
Can we manage to put him up?

182
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:39,453
Well, since he didn't take the hint
and leave, l suppose we'll have to.

183
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,133
For one night, at least.

184
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,413
Welcome.

185
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:49,413
This is Mr. Malus,
an officer from the mainland.

186
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:51,813
-And this is--
-Willow.

187
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:54,773
Of course.

188
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,453
She'll show you upstairs.

189
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:06,373
There's an empty room on the top floor.

190
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,893
l think l'll have a drink first.

191
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:16,013
As long as l'm not intruding.

192
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:21,213
This here is mead.
lt's one of the pleasures of our island.

193
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,933
A brew of honey, herbs...

194
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:26,413
...and whatnot.

195
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,413
Thanks.

196
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:33,413
Yeah.

197
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,453
l think you ought to know.

198
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:50,093
l think you all should know
that l'm here on business.

199
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:54,493
This is official police business and l wanna
speak to each one of you at some point.

200
00:19:56,453 --> 00:19:59,213
Official California business, is it?

201
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:02,253
Because this is Washington.

202
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:03,413
l'm aware of that.

203
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,493
-Then fine.
-No.

204
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:10,293
Mrs. Beech, it is not fine.
lt is anything but fine when a person is lost.

205
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:11,333
Especially a child.

206
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,493
Now, why would you go
and do a thing like that?

207
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,733
Sorry, l'm allergic.

208
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:58,653
I am being watched,
but we must try to speak later in private.

209
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:03,493
There's a place out beyond the point.
Meet me there in an hour.

210
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:08,733
Edward, be careful
and believe nothing that you see or hear.

211
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:13,453
My God, to see your face again....

212
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:24,573
You know, traditionally, the guy gets
his ring back when the fiancee runs away.

213
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,933
l still wear it, sort of.

214
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:39,253
l don't know what l would've done
if you hadn't come.

215
00:21:39,613 --> 00:21:42,493
-How could l not?
-Easily.

216
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:47,173
You could've thought l was a madwoman
or something raving about my lost daughter.

217
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,213
They all do.

218
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:54,493
Look, l'm barely adjusted to the fact
that you have a daughter, okay?

219
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,413
So let's go slow here.

220
00:21:59,893 --> 00:22:01,133
So....

221
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:04,093
No. No.

222
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:08,013
That's the only way to start this.
What in the hell happened to you?

223
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:09,213
l didn't....

224
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:17,213
Look, it was a long time ago.
We were young.

225
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:18,973
So what?

226
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:22,813
Well, why do we do anything in this life?

227
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:28,453
l need some kind of answer here.

228
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:33,173
Was it some other guy, or...?

229
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:36,573
l mean, obviously,
you met someone, but--

230
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,333
Look, l was scared and....

231
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:46,373
l don't know, l just--
l wasn't ready for this...

232
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:50,133
...so l ran back home.

233
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:54,453
lt's quite a home, by the way.
This place.

234
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:58,773
We're different here. l know that.

235
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:04,093
lf you've grown up around it,
it's one thing, but it's....

236
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:08,333
Yes, odd.

237
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,333
Anyway....

238
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:15,893
My daughter is what matters
to me now. Rowan.

239
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:20,293
Why do this?

240
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:25,493
Stir this all up again? lt's so....

241
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:31,653
Why don't you just
get her dad to help you?

242
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:34,693
Because the only person l trust is you.

243
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:39,013
Even after all these years.

244
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,973
Edward.

245
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:50,373
People will try to mislead you, they will,
but you must trust me.

246
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:53,093
-l wanna help you, but--
-No, she has been taken.

247
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:57,253
By who, l don't know. l don't.
But my little girl is still here.

248
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:01,613
l promise you, if she's here, l'll find her.

249
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:04,573
-l know you will.
-l'm gonna need to ask you some questions.

250
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:09,133
Okay. l'll meet you again
as soon as it's safe. l have to go now.

251
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:30,813
Leave us.

252
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,013
Greetings, Sister Beech.

253
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:39,733
A lovely evening.

254
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:41,893
lt is indeed. Welcome, all.

255
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:47,213
Will Sister Summersisle bless us
with her presence?

256
00:24:47,413 --> 00:24:49,173
l'm afraid not.

257
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:53,493
Enjoy the night. Only, make sure
you're ready for the day of tomorrow.

258
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:56,573
The time of death and rebirth.

259
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:02,413
-Yes. Of the Wicker Man's return.
-Yes. Of the Wicker Man's return.

260
00:25:04,893 --> 00:25:06,253
Excuse me.

261
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:10,253
Did someone unpack my bag?
Because l'm missing some tapes.

262
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:13,053
-l wouldn't know.
-They're called Everything's OK!

263
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,333
Good.

264
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:44,413
Edward, I know that we haven't spoken
in a few years and things ended badly...

265
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,813
...or I ended them badly, to be more fair.

266
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:51,613
I didn't wanna hurt you
any more than I did.

267
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:53,373
Now I must.

268
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:00,373
That's not her daughter.

269
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:10,853
Did you get my doll?

270
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:13,733
Yeah, l got it, honey.
lt's a little banged up.

271
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,693
Rowan?

272
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:15,133
Rowan?

273
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,373
Rowan?

274
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:26,973
Hello?

275
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:33,653
Rowan?

276
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:55,013
Why do you have store-bought?
l thought you made this stuff here.

277
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,413
Look, l just serve what l'm handed.

278
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,413
lf you don't like it, you'll have
to talk to Sister Beech, all right?

279
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,613
What's with this ''sister'' thing, anyway?

280
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:10,453
lt's just our way.
We don't have any Royal Honey for you.

281
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:12,613
None at all?

282
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:14,773
No, not a drop.

283
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,413
Our crop was cursed last year.

284
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:23,013
l might find you
a little bit of sugar.

285
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:27,133
All right.

286
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:29,853
Okay.

287
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:14,453
Mr. Malus? Your sweetener.

288
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:18,093
Thanks. What are these?
Festivals of some kind?

289
00:32:18,293 --> 00:32:23,013
That's right, our Harvest Festival.
We have one the end of each autumn.

290
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:26,373
And then the Festival of Fertility too,
of course.

291
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:30,453
But that's too sacred.
No pictures can be taken of that.

292
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:33,813
What happened to last year's?

293
00:32:35,173 --> 00:32:39,373
Afraid it got ruined last night. Broke.

294
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,733
Hey. l meant to ask you in there,
do you recognize this girl?

295
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,693
No?

296
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:27,613
-Where's the other woman who works here?
-She's gone up to the village school.

297
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:31,533
Where is that?

298
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,573
Up the hill and through the woods.

299
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:39,653
All right. Perfect.

300
00:33:42,493 --> 00:33:43,613
Look, l'm sorry.

301
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:47,453
What's happening here
the day of tomorrow?

302
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:52,173
You mean, the day after tomorrow?
lt's kind of a strange way to put it.

303
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:56,413
Yeah, l suppose.
l thought the other was a local expression.

304
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:57,573
Let's see.

305
00:33:57,813 --> 00:34:03,293
The day after tomorrow would be
May the 2nd. Nothing, as far as l know.

306
00:34:03,493 --> 00:34:06,333
No, l mean tomorrow.
What's happening here then?

307
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,053
l told you.

308
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:10,493
You did?

309
00:34:12,453 --> 00:34:15,413
When you leave,
will you take me with you?

310
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:00,933
Hi.

311
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:07,813
Good morning.

312
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:32,173
And, Daisy, will you tell us
what man represents in his purest form?

313
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:40,893
-Yes.
-Phallic symbol. Phallic symbol.

314
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,853
School's really changed
since l was a kid.

315
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:48,133
How dare you stand there
and frighten my children.

316
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:51,533
Sorry. l'm Edward Malus from California.

317
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:55,533
l'm a policeman. See my badge?

318
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:58,413
l was unaware
any of my girls needed arresting.

319
00:35:58,413 --> 00:35:59,933
They don't, no.

320
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:03,413
l'm here to find a missing girl
whom people are pretending doesn't exist.

321
00:36:03,613 --> 00:36:05,773
-How quixotic of you.
-Quixotic?

322
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:11,053
From Don Quixote, pursuer of lofty
but impractical ideals.

323
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,413
Usually a man.

324
00:36:13,613 --> 00:36:16,373
Look, l just need to speak
to Willow Woodward. ls she here?

325
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:22,453
Already gone, l'm afraid. You're late.
And the law won't help you with that.

326
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:27,053
Let me have your attention
for a second.

327
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:31,253
As you might've heard, l'm here to verify
the whereabouts of a young girl.

328
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:36,893
-What's your name?
-Lily.

329
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,053
Lily, l'm Officer Ed. Hi.

330
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:41,373
Could you pass that around
for me, sweetheart?

331
00:36:58,693 --> 00:37:01,093
That is her name, Rowan Woodward.

332
00:37:01,293 --> 00:37:04,613
Do any of you recognize the name
or the photograph?

333
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,413
There's your answer.

334
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:14,973
lf she existed, we would know of her.
Now, will you please go?

335
00:37:19,773 --> 00:37:22,013
Whose desk is this?

336
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:30,973
What?!

337
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:37,013
We trapped the little bird inside
to see how long he can stand it.

338
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:42,413
Now, why in the hell would you let them
do a sick thing like that?

339
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:47,453
-Where's the attendance?
-You have Sister Summersisle's authority?

340
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:50,373
No, l do not have--
You forget that this is a legal matter.

341
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:53,413
Well, l'm afraid
you still need her permission.

342
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:59,213
Put that back. Put that back.

343
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:02,293
Sorry. You're gonna have
to bear with me.

344
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,693
You little liars.

345
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:21,733
Rowan Woodward is your classmate,
isn't she?

346
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:26,413
lsn't she? That is her desk.

347
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:27,573
You're the biggest liar.

348
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,693
l'm warning you, you tell me another
and l'll arrest you myself.

349
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:33,213
That is a promise, Miss...?

350
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,653
Rose. Sister Rose.

351
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:37,453
Of course. Another plant. Rose.

352
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:40,813
For the last time, where is this girl?

353
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:43,453
l'll speak to you outside.

354
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:46,533
Girls, continue with your compositions.

355
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:08,733
-Well?
-You don't understand.

356
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:11,693
That's exactly right. l do not understand.
But l'm going to.

357
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,533
Mr. Malus, no one is lying to you.

358
00:39:14,773 --> 00:39:17,533
l told you that if Rowan Woodward existed,
we'd know of her.

359
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,693
lf she existed? lf?

360
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:24,533
-But you cannot come barging into our--
-l saw that she existed with my own eyes.

361
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:28,053
And l suppose her mother is lying
to me too, huh? She's lying?

362
00:39:28,253 --> 00:39:30,173
Not lying, no.

363
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:32,093
Grieving.

364
00:39:32,653 --> 00:39:34,493
We all are.

365
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:39,093
Wait, wait, wait.
When you say that she's grieving...

366
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,173
...you mean that Rowan is dead?

367
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:43,973
You would say so. Yes.

368
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:47,373
-She's dead or she isn't?
-We never use that word here.

369
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:48,973
No, that'd be too quixotic.

370
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:50,333
Yes.

371
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:54,733
You see, we believe that after
the human life is over, the soul lives on...

372
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:58,133
...in air, in the trees, in animals,
in fire, even.

373
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:02,533
All right, all right, just-- Come on.
Tell me what happened to her. Honestly.

374
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:07,013
-lt was an accident.
-What kind of accident? How?

375
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,173
Mr. Malus, it was an accident.
Leave things alone, please.

376
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:14,133
Now, if that's true, where's her body?

377
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:17,413
Exactly where you would expect it to be.
ln the earth.

378
00:40:17,453 --> 00:40:19,253
ln a churchyard?

379
00:40:19,493 --> 00:40:20,773
Her mother insisted.

380
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:24,333
Now, if you will excuse me,
l have to get back to my class.

381
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:30,213
Wait, wait, Miss Ro-- Sister Rose.
Wait a minute.

382
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:32,573
How'd she die?

383
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:34,933
She'll burn to death.

384
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:37,653
What? What'd you just say?

385
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:43,813
Precisely what l meant to.
She burned to death.

386
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:07,413
Excuse me.

387
00:41:08,413 --> 00:41:12,013
-ls there some church near here?
-Yeah.

388
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:13,213
Down the hill.

389
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:19,533
Hey, didn't l just speak with you?
Miss Rose-- Sister Rose.

390
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:21,053
No, you didn't.

391
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:13,133
-That's not Rowan's grave.
-All right.

392
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:17,333
lt isn't. l know that this seems....

393
00:42:18,093 --> 00:42:19,773
But they put it there. l didn't.

394
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:22,173
Who's ''they''?

395
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:29,013
l don't know.

396
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:33,453
Whoever's doing this, trying to make--

397
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:51,533
lt's not much now,
but it used to be lovely.

398
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:54,213
That's what they say, anyway.

399
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:57,013
lt was built before
my ancestors came here.

400
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:01,013
That's the crypt, but it's all flooded.

401
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:02,733
lt's a new lock.

402
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,493
Rowan is alive.

403
00:43:14,453 --> 00:43:17,293
That's not what folks
have been telling me.

404
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:22,453
l've heard that she doesn't exist,
that she's buried in that graveyard...

405
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:25,053
...even that she's....

406
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,533
She burnt to death.

407
00:43:29,213 --> 00:43:33,613
The liars!
They can't accept her, or won't.

408
00:43:33,813 --> 00:43:36,853
They seem to blame her for all--

409
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:47,453
Edward, l think
they're gonna hurt her, or even--

410
00:43:47,453 --> 00:43:51,973
Why would they?
l'm trying to understand. l am.

411
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:53,813
But why?

412
00:43:55,413 --> 00:44:01,333
l ran off once, tried to get away.
They think l'm too proud, or that l--

413
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:07,573
Sister Summersisle has never been
very fond of my wild ways.

414
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:12,893
Yeah, that name keeps coming up.
This Summersisle.

415
00:44:15,573 --> 00:44:18,453
-Who is she?
-She's everything.

416
00:44:19,213 --> 00:44:22,373
Everything you see,
all of it, really, is her.

417
00:44:22,573 --> 00:44:25,653
The rest of us, we just--
We live in her shadow.

418
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:28,293
Me, especially.

419
00:44:32,453 --> 00:44:34,413
They're all saying l've lost it?

420
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:36,453
l haven't, Edward.

421
00:44:36,453 --> 00:44:38,853
l promise, l haven't. She's--

422
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:45,173
l can't let them do this to me.

423
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:49,773
Do what?
What is it you're not telling me?

424
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:52,413
Forgive me?

425
00:44:53,773 --> 00:44:55,973
Forgive you for...?

426
00:44:57,293 --> 00:44:58,333
l'm lost.

427
00:44:58,533 --> 00:45:00,693
l don't know.

428
00:45:02,293 --> 00:45:03,533
Don't worry, it's....

429
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,653
You know?

430
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:09,773
No. l don't know. l do not know
that our daughter's gonna be okay.

431
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:19,893
Now you know
what l've been trying to tell you.

432
00:45:21,413 --> 00:45:24,293
Why l need you to help me.

433
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:33,373
You're telling me l'm Rowan's father?

434
00:45:34,493 --> 00:45:36,053
Yes.

435
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:51,493
That's not right.

436
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,453
You should have told me, Willow.

437
00:46:19,053 --> 00:46:21,053
So this is where you last saw Rowan?

438
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:23,733
Yeah?

439
00:46:24,453 --> 00:46:27,013
Can you give me the details?
lt's important.

440
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:31,453
Yeah. The last time l saw her was....

441
00:46:31,453 --> 00:46:34,093
She was sitting there at the desk.

442
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,373
Rowan loves to draw.

443
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:41,093
And swim. You know,
she can swim like some--

444
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:43,053
Swim. Okay.

445
00:46:43,493 --> 00:46:46,253
So you go out, right? You went out.

446
00:46:46,453 --> 00:46:48,973
Only down to the market.
For no more than a half-hour.

447
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,533
-And you get back, and what?
-And she was gone.

448
00:46:52,493 --> 00:46:54,413
Vanished.

449
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:58,413
And all her things, her toys,
books, everything, it's like they--

450
00:46:58,653 --> 00:47:00,213
What was she wearing?

451
00:47:00,453 --> 00:47:03,053
A sweater l made her.

452
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:08,173
The one in the photo. She had that on.

453
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:10,733
She dresses like every other child
on this island.

454
00:47:12,213 --> 00:47:15,133
-Do you have any other photographs of her?
-No.

455
00:47:15,573 --> 00:47:20,013
We didn't have many.
l mean, with only Dr. Moss taking them.

456
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:23,373
Dr. Moss?

457
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:31,013
And you're sure it's no way
it could be someone from off the island?

458
00:47:32,453 --> 00:47:33,453
No.

459
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:37,213
They're careful about
who they allow here.

460
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:40,333
Was Rowan depressed at all?

461
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:43,693
Have you seen what she's drawn
underneath her desk? lt's disturbing.

462
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:46,173
Edward, l know that.

463
00:47:54,853 --> 00:47:55,853
What are you doing?

464
00:47:57,493 --> 00:47:59,613
The plane. l need its radio.

465
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:01,533
Wait for me.

466
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:27,333
Hello?

467
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:32,333
Hello?

468
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:35,213
Where is this guy?

469
00:49:28,493 --> 00:49:29,693
Rowan?!

470
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:35,293
Rowan!

471
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:12,373
Goddamn it!

472
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:40,493
You're persistent. l'm on my way out,
but perhaps l can help in some way?

473
00:51:41,173 --> 00:51:43,453
l need to ask a couple of questions.

474
00:51:43,453 --> 00:51:44,613
lt's quick.

475
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:47,053
Things are rarely quick.

476
00:51:47,253 --> 00:51:48,333
Come inside, then.

477
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,453
Thank you.

478
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:57,933
You're T.H. Moss, the photographer.

479
00:51:58,173 --> 00:52:02,213
l'm first a physician,
second a photographer. A distant second.

480
00:52:02,573 --> 00:52:04,133
Did you want your picture taken?

481
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:08,893
So you take the Harvest Festival
photographs every year?

482
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:11,413
The ones l saw up at the tavern?

483
00:52:11,613 --> 00:52:14,533
Yes, it's a rather humdrum affair,
l'm afraid.

484
00:52:16,773 --> 00:52:19,773
My mother passed the skill on to me,
as her mother before her.

485
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:23,813
Your mother. Of course.
Do you have last year's photographs?

486
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:28,213
-lsn't it there with the others?
-No. No, apparently it got destroyed.

487
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:30,053
What a pity.

488
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:32,613
Do you have a copy?

489
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:36,573
l have the negative. l could have
one printed up for you, if you like.

490
00:52:36,773 --> 00:52:39,013
That'd be great.

491
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:44,493
Thanks.

492
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,373
lt's time, sister.

493
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:05,133
We must hurry.

494
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:40,333
''In societies as disparate as ancient Egypt
and pre-Columbian Incan...

495
00:53:40,573 --> 00:53:43,813
...fertility festivals were utilized
in much the same way.

496
00:53:44,413 --> 00:53:47,573
A younger woman was chosen
to personify fertility...

497
00:53:47,773 --> 00:53:50,733
...and then killed in a blood ritual
by the presiding priesthood.

498
00:53:50,933 --> 00:53:55,613
This gesture was thought to guarantee
a successful harvest for the coming year.

499
00:53:58,093 --> 00:54:02,053
In Europe and the Americas, on the
other hand, the offering was often burnt. ''

500
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:04,453
Burnt.

501
00:54:23,573 --> 00:54:25,173
Oh, God.

502
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,413
''Rowan Woodward Goddess.''

503
00:55:08,173 --> 00:55:10,173
''Worst harvest on record.''

504
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:21,453
Hey.

505
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,213
What the hell is this?

506
00:55:29,973 --> 00:55:33,693
-lt's a picture, that's all.
-No, that is not all!

507
00:55:35,453 --> 00:55:39,173
Why didn't you tell me Rowan was a part
of all this, huh? These rituals?

508
00:55:40,613 --> 00:55:41,613
l don't know.

509
00:55:41,813 --> 00:55:44,973
Try, because l'm bouncing around
in circles and l can use some help!

510
00:55:45,173 --> 00:55:48,413
-Edward, why are you yelling at me?
-How about this, for starters:

511
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:51,173
Our daughter is part
of your worst harvest on record.

512
00:55:51,413 --> 00:55:54,333
You said they blamed her.
Why didn't you tell me about this?

513
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:57,893
lt's just-- lt's a ceremony that we have.

514
00:55:58,133 --> 00:55:59,533
l don't know anything else.

515
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,493
You live here! You must know something.

516
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,653
You mentioned this ceremony.
Define it!

517
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:08,093
What is the day of death and rebirth?

518
00:56:08,293 --> 00:56:11,653
lt's a story. That's all it is, a story.

519
00:56:11,853 --> 00:56:15,493
l'm trying to trust you, but when l turn
my head, something doesn't make sense.

520
00:56:15,693 --> 00:56:17,893
Well, l'm frightened of this place too.

521
00:56:18,613 --> 00:56:22,973
l was happy to leave here when l did.
Even though l came back...

522
00:56:23,173 --> 00:56:24,333
...l wish l hadn't.

523
00:56:24,373 --> 00:56:27,013
l wish that l stayed
and made a life with you...

524
00:56:27,253 --> 00:56:29,693
...been with you all these years,
but l didn't.

525
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:32,613
l came back here and had our child,
and now she's--

526
00:56:32,813 --> 00:56:37,373
Okay. All right. l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to....

527
00:56:37,373 --> 00:56:38,933
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

528
00:56:41,813 --> 00:56:43,053
We'll keep looking.

529
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:48,093
l'm gonna see this Summersisle lady.

530
00:56:48,293 --> 00:56:50,413
We have to check everything
if we're gonna find Rowan.

531
00:56:50,693 --> 00:56:52,333
lf?

532
00:56:52,853 --> 00:56:54,333
lf we find her?

533
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:56,653
No. When. When we find her.

534
00:57:31,613 --> 00:57:34,453
Let me give you a hand.
Want some help?

535
00:57:47,893 --> 00:57:49,533
You okay?

536
00:57:51,493 --> 00:57:52,533
Can't you talk?

537
00:59:54,733 --> 00:59:56,613
Keep your head down!

538
00:59:58,653 --> 01:00:02,493
If she existed, we would know of her.
Now, will you please go?

539
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,413
Rowan Woodward is your classmate,
isn't she?

540
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,093
Isn't she?

541
01:00:15,493 --> 01:00:19,213
Had a scare, didn't we?
You've been sleeping for several hours.

542
01:00:22,293 --> 01:00:23,413
Where am l?

543
01:00:24,493 --> 01:00:26,693
This is the home of Sister Summersisle.

544
01:00:26,893 --> 01:00:28,373
lvy?

545
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,893
Did you use my kit?

546
01:00:38,893 --> 01:00:41,493
-The adrenaline shot, or--?
-Oh, no.

547
01:00:41,493 --> 01:00:42,893
Nothing like that.

548
01:00:43,093 --> 01:00:46,493
When they brought me to you,
you were near death, clearly.

549
01:00:46,493 --> 01:00:49,693
So l treated the danger in the old way.

550
01:00:55,253 --> 01:00:59,093
You are alive. That's what's important.

551
01:01:04,613 --> 01:01:07,013
l'm here to see Sister Summersisle.

552
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:09,413
Yes. She's out front now.

553
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:15,493
And she's been expecting you.

554
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:34,453
They nearly had you.

555
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:36,453
Excuse me?

556
01:02:37,373 --> 01:02:40,333
Our little friends, the bees.

557
01:02:40,813 --> 01:02:42,173
They almost did you in.

558
01:02:42,373 --> 01:02:43,813
Yeah.

559
01:02:44,453 --> 01:02:46,093
Pity.

560
01:02:46,453 --> 01:02:50,573
Pity, what? They nearly did or didn't?

561
01:02:55,413 --> 01:02:58,813
Some of our keepers found you,
down near the stables.

562
01:02:59,213 --> 01:03:00,213
Unconscious.

563
01:03:00,413 --> 01:03:04,093
Yeah. Beekeepers.
They seem to be everywhere on the island.

564
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:08,773
Oh, yes. lt takes quite a few of them
to keep order around here.

565
01:03:09,013 --> 01:03:10,773
l'm sure.

566
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:15,493
l can tell what she sees in you.

567
01:03:15,573 --> 01:03:19,293
A kind of rough potential.

568
01:03:19,493 --> 01:03:21,493
Thanks, l guess.

569
01:03:21,493 --> 01:03:24,613
So l hear you were expecting me.

570
01:03:24,853 --> 01:03:26,333
Why's that?

571
01:03:27,173 --> 01:03:30,093
Just a matter of time
before you came here.

572
01:03:30,493 --> 01:03:33,333
l believe you're looking for a child?

573
01:03:33,933 --> 01:03:36,133
-l might have found her.
-Excellent.

574
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,893
Not exactly.

575
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:39,133
ln a grave.

576
01:03:39,613 --> 01:03:43,773
And l'd like your permission
to exhume the body, if one exists...

577
01:03:44,013 --> 01:03:45,773
...and have it removed for an autopsy.

578
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:48,853
You suspect foul play?

579
01:03:49,053 --> 01:03:51,093
Yeah. Murder.

580
01:03:52,213 --> 01:03:53,893
How perplexing for you.

581
01:03:55,253 --> 01:03:58,373
ln that case, you must carry on.

582
01:04:00,413 --> 01:04:02,293
You don't seem very concerned.

583
01:04:02,493 --> 01:04:04,173
No.

584
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,813
l suppose because l have...

585
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:11,133
...confidence that your suspicions
are wrong.

586
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:13,293
We don't murder here.

587
01:04:14,253 --> 01:04:19,173
Yeah. Well, even if a victim complies,
it's still murder.

588
01:04:19,373 --> 01:04:22,053
Well, perhaps where you come from.

589
01:04:23,253 --> 01:04:24,893
But we have our own beliefs.

590
01:04:25,093 --> 01:04:27,373
Right, right, right.

591
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:32,533
The festivals. All those offerings.
To whom, exactly?

592
01:04:34,253 --> 01:04:37,893
To the great Mother Goddess
who rules this island...

593
01:04:38,093 --> 01:04:41,973
...with me as her earthly representative.

594
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:44,253
You?

595
01:04:44,493 --> 01:04:48,493
l'm the spiritual heart of this colony.

596
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:52,813
You honestly encourage
this sort of worship?

597
01:04:54,613 --> 01:04:59,533
Come on. lt's so nice. Let's wander.

598
01:05:02,493 --> 01:05:05,893
My Celtic ancestors, all the way back...

599
01:05:06,093 --> 01:05:09,493
...rebelled against the suppression
of the feminine.

600
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:16,093
So in the late 1 7th century,
they fled to the New World.

601
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:20,333
Unfortunately, they settled near Salem.

602
01:05:20,373 --> 01:05:25,213
So when they saw that
the persecution continued, even here...

603
01:05:25,933 --> 01:05:30,733
...well, that started a long
and painful migration westward.

604
01:05:30,933 --> 01:05:36,613
ln the 1 850s, my great-great-grandmother
led a group of people here...

605
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:42,333
...and vowed never to enter
into that other world again.

606
01:05:42,573 --> 01:05:44,413
How's that possible? You can't just--

607
01:05:44,613 --> 01:05:49,133
Oh, those pioneers needed
little urging to isolate.

608
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:52,973
They were looking
for a simpler way of life.

609
01:05:54,173 --> 01:05:56,933
Of course, some do leave,
like our Willow...

610
01:05:57,693 --> 01:06:00,493
...you know, to test themselves or us.

611
01:06:00,493 --> 01:06:02,053
Or to find a man.

612
01:06:02,573 --> 01:06:05,893
But they always come home, eventually.

613
01:06:06,613 --> 01:06:13,213
-Men are what, second-class citizens?
-No, not at all. We love our men.

614
01:06:13,373 --> 01:06:16,693
We're just not subservient to them.

615
01:06:16,893 --> 01:06:20,453
The men are a very important part
of our little colony.

616
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,053
Breeding, you know.

617
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:27,053
God.

618
01:06:27,253 --> 01:06:31,173
Quite a little racket you've got going
for yourself here. Breeding?

619
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:33,893
Sounds like inbreeding to me.

620
01:06:34,093 --> 01:06:37,333
Please don't criticize
what you know nothing about.

621
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:41,333
Don't any of you wanna just be
with someone? Fall in love?

622
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:45,373
We procreate because
that's the desire of the Goddess.

623
01:06:45,373 --> 01:06:48,413
To assure ourselves of worthy offspring.

624
01:06:48,613 --> 01:06:52,373
The strongest, the finest,
the most sturdy of our kind.

625
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:55,933
l see. Female, right?

626
01:06:56,653 --> 01:07:00,853
And what if someone just happens
to have a boy? What do you do then?

627
01:07:01,613 --> 01:07:02,853
That depends.

628
01:07:08,933 --> 01:07:12,253
Let me ask you one other thing,
because, frankly, l just don't get you.

629
01:07:12,453 --> 01:07:13,973
l do not get this place.

630
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:16,453
Oh, you will. ln time, perhaps.

631
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:19,453
Perhaps it is time for you
to stop bullshitting me, okay?

632
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:20,453
Now, you be careful.

633
01:07:20,653 --> 01:07:24,213
Especially when a little girl's life
is at stake. My little girl.

634
01:07:24,413 --> 01:07:26,253
l'm sure you've guessed.

635
01:07:26,453 --> 01:07:28,253
As a matter of fact, yes.

636
01:07:29,493 --> 01:07:32,213
l'm only interested in the law, sister.

637
01:07:32,453 --> 01:07:36,853
l need to remind you, you are still within
reach of the powers of a normal society.

638
01:07:37,093 --> 01:07:41,453
So if you wackos practice kidnapping
and ritualized murder, it is my job--

639
01:07:41,693 --> 01:07:45,413
l believe l've mentioned
our stand on murder.

640
01:07:45,413 --> 01:07:47,693
Murder is murder.

641
01:07:47,893 --> 01:07:51,413
Now, do l have permission to open
the grave of Rowan Woodward?

642
01:07:51,413 --> 01:07:54,453
l was under the impression
l'd already given it to you.

643
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,493
Your transport.

644
01:07:56,493 --> 01:08:02,813
Well, it's just been fascinating to converse
with someone from a normal society.

645
01:08:03,013 --> 01:08:04,613
Till we meet again.

646
01:09:16,973 --> 01:09:18,853
Rowan?

647
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:23,333
Rowan?

648
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:50,453
Rowan?

649
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:33,013
Rowan?

650
01:10:47,413 --> 01:10:49,053
Rowan?

651
01:11:02,453 --> 01:11:04,813
Rowan? Rowan!

652
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,533
Help!

653
01:12:13,893 --> 01:12:15,053
Hey!

654
01:12:21,733 --> 01:12:23,933
Help!

655
01:12:26,933 --> 01:12:29,373
Help!

656
01:12:49,973 --> 01:12:54,293
My daughter is what matters
to me now. Rowan.

657
01:13:01,533 --> 01:13:04,933
I wish that I stayed and made a life
with you, but I didn't.

658
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:07,893
I came back here and had our child,
and now she's....

659
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,133
-Well, who were they?
-Don't know.

660
01:13:13,253 --> 01:13:14,693
May never know.

661
01:13:28,733 --> 01:13:30,493
Edward?

662
01:13:33,013 --> 01:13:34,373
l'm down here.

663
01:13:34,573 --> 01:13:35,773
Edward?

664
01:13:35,973 --> 01:13:38,973
Yeah. Somebody shut the lid.

665
01:13:39,173 --> 01:13:41,653
-l'm coming.
-Oh, God.

666
01:14:07,813 --> 01:14:11,813
Willow. Look. Look at this.

667
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:17,413
She was here. She was down there.
Somebody's keeping her here.

668
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,493
l wanna show you something else.
Come on.

669
01:14:34,493 --> 01:14:37,333
This hers? Tell me!

670
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:39,333
Yes, l think it-- Yeah, but--

671
01:14:39,533 --> 01:14:41,813
How'd it get burned?
How'd it get burned?!

672
01:14:42,013 --> 01:14:43,413
How'd it get burned?!

673
01:14:43,413 --> 01:14:45,053
l don't know!

674
01:14:45,493 --> 01:14:47,213
-Where are you going?
-To her place.

675
01:14:47,453 --> 01:14:49,333
-l'm coming with you.
-No, Willow! l mean it.

676
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:51,053
But maybe if we--

677
01:14:51,853 --> 01:14:53,533
Why are you--?

678
01:14:53,733 --> 01:14:55,533
Why are you looking at me like that?

679
01:14:55,733 --> 01:15:00,333
Something bad is about to happen.
l can feel it.

680
01:15:02,853 --> 01:15:05,973
Go to the house and lock yourself in.
l'll come back for you.

681
01:15:06,973 --> 01:15:08,293
Go! Now!

682
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:27,693
Summersisle!

683
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:33,213
Summersisle?

684
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,493
Summersisle!

685
01:15:47,173 --> 01:15:49,093
Summersisle?

686
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:51,733
Summersisle!

687
01:15:56,373 --> 01:15:58,373
Summersisle!

688
01:16:13,533 --> 01:16:15,413
Summersisle?

689
01:16:16,933 --> 01:16:18,693
Summersisle!

690
01:16:20,373 --> 01:16:22,453
Summersisle!

691
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,573
He's gone now.

692
01:16:34,973 --> 01:16:36,933
Excellent.

693
01:16:53,293 --> 01:16:56,573
-What's with the feathers?
-We're all preparing.

694
01:16:56,773 --> 01:16:59,253
-For what? A celebration?
-Oh, yes.

695
01:16:59,493 --> 01:17:02,213
Of death and rebirth.

696
01:17:02,453 --> 01:17:04,813
Sister Rose, she's only a child.

697
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:07,733
You're a teacher.
Think about what you're doing.

698
01:17:07,933 --> 01:17:11,893
The time for sentiment is over.
The moment has come.

699
01:17:12,093 --> 01:17:13,333
l won't let her die.

700
01:17:13,533 --> 01:17:17,493
So gallant, Sir Knight.
Still tilting windmills, l see.

701
01:17:17,493 --> 01:17:19,013
Right until the end.

702
01:17:19,213 --> 01:17:20,413
Get off the bike.

703
01:17:21,813 --> 01:17:23,213
Get off the bike.

704
01:17:25,653 --> 01:17:27,533
Step away from the bike.

705
01:17:30,533 --> 01:17:32,453
Take your stupid mask.

706
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:45,053
-lt is he.
-lt is he.

707
01:18:14,693 --> 01:18:17,413
l need your help. All of you.

708
01:18:17,613 --> 01:18:19,973
Can't you hear me?
l said l need your help.

709
01:18:23,813 --> 01:18:25,573
Don't be afraid.

710
01:18:40,653 --> 01:18:44,173
l'm looking for a missing girl.
Take that mask off your kid.

711
01:18:47,413 --> 01:18:50,613
You wait a minute! Do you have
permission to charge in and disturb--?

712
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:52,973
No! l don't need anybody's
goddamn permission!

713
01:18:53,613 --> 01:18:56,853
l'm gonna search every inch of this town
and anybody who interferes...

714
01:18:57,053 --> 01:18:59,373
...will be brought up on murder charges,
got that?

715
01:18:59,373 --> 01:19:02,813
You have my permission
to stay out of the fucking way!

716
01:19:23,453 --> 01:19:26,373
Hey! Take those masks off.

717
01:19:26,373 --> 01:19:29,013
-Hey! Stop it!
-Come here.

718
01:19:29,213 --> 01:19:32,053
-Go away. Don't.
-Get out.

719
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:39,253
Rowan?

720
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,373
Rowan?

721
01:20:52,093 --> 01:20:55,933
l trust you won't have to let
your costume out again this year, sister.

722
01:20:56,133 --> 01:21:00,133
Very soon you'll be
an entire family of bears.

723
01:21:02,093 --> 01:21:04,013
Oh, l'll manage, Sister Oak.

724
01:21:04,213 --> 01:21:07,693
lt does seem to shrink
a bit each year, however.

725
01:21:08,653 --> 01:21:12,373
So, sister, did you see
to that business at the harbor?

726
01:21:12,573 --> 01:21:15,413
Oh, yes. Just as you instructed.

727
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:19,813
Now l'll be off.

728
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:22,493
Well, well.

729
01:21:22,973 --> 01:21:26,333
You look a bit worse for wear,
now, don't you?

730
01:21:58,253 --> 01:22:00,733
O Goddess of the Fields...

731
01:22:01,373 --> 01:22:06,013
...l bring this humble colony before you
on this day.

732
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:08,493
This most sacred of days.

733
01:22:08,693 --> 01:22:10,973
Please accept our offering.

734
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:15,253
Hail, Goddess of the Fields.
Accept our offering.

735
01:22:15,453 --> 01:22:18,093
That you will once again
in the year to come...

736
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:23,053
...bestow on us
the rich and diverse fruits of thy realm.

737
01:22:57,093 --> 01:22:58,333
God!

738
01:24:05,933 --> 01:24:08,213
l thought l told you to wait for me.

739
01:24:08,893 --> 01:24:10,973
What do you mean? l had to come.

740
01:24:39,893 --> 01:24:41,373
And now...

741
01:24:41,693 --> 01:24:44,053
...we fulfill our deepest purpose...

742
01:24:44,733 --> 01:24:47,453
...to balance the forces of dark and light.

743
01:24:51,413 --> 01:24:52,813
Oh, good God.

744
01:25:09,493 --> 01:25:11,173
What is it? What's wrong, sister?

745
01:25:12,533 --> 01:25:13,813
Don't be frightened.

746
01:25:14,773 --> 01:25:16,413
Go.

747
01:25:16,613 --> 01:25:18,813
My name is Edward. l'm gonna save you.

748
01:25:44,653 --> 01:25:47,013
Come on. This way.

749
01:25:51,373 --> 01:25:52,973
Hurry.

750
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:28,493
Wait. Rowan. Rowan, wait. Wait.

751
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:35,933
Hello? Hello? Pete! Pete! Help us!

752
01:26:36,133 --> 01:26:39,893
Help! Please! Please help!

753
01:26:47,573 --> 01:26:49,493
Come on. Let's go.

754
01:26:55,173 --> 01:26:59,253
Rowan. Honey. Slow down.

755
01:27:02,613 --> 01:27:04,573
Rowan, slow down.

756
01:27:08,573 --> 01:27:11,493
Rowan! Rowan, stop!

757
01:27:12,613 --> 01:27:14,493
Did l do it right, Mommy? Did l?

758
01:27:14,693 --> 01:27:15,973
Yes, my love.

759
01:27:16,173 --> 01:27:17,773
Oh, my little Rowan.

760
01:27:17,973 --> 01:27:19,573
You did it excellently.

761
01:27:20,053 --> 01:27:23,133
Don't touch her! Do not touch her!

762
01:27:23,733 --> 01:27:24,933
Rowan, come back here.

763
01:27:26,613 --> 01:27:27,733
Welcome, Mr. Malus.

764
01:27:27,933 --> 01:27:30,173
You have come of your own free will...

765
01:27:30,373 --> 01:27:32,853
...to keep this appointment
with the Wicker Man.

766
01:27:33,093 --> 01:27:34,693
Stay back!

767
01:27:36,813 --> 01:27:38,853
And now the game is over.

768
01:27:39,093 --> 01:27:41,453
The game of the hunter
leading the hunted.

769
01:27:41,653 --> 01:27:44,013
You came to find our little Rowan.

770
01:27:44,213 --> 01:27:47,493
But it is we who have found you,
just as we intended to do.

771
01:27:47,493 --> 01:27:51,733
l don't understand. Rowan was missing.
l had to come. l had a letter.

772
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,293
Willow, tell them.

773
01:27:55,613 --> 01:27:57,053
Willow, please tell them.

774
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:00,973
The letter was from all of us here.

775
01:28:01,493 --> 01:28:03,053
Your invitation to visit...

776
01:28:04,453 --> 01:28:05,453
...one might say.

777
01:28:05,653 --> 01:28:08,253
You were just the man we needed.

778
01:28:08,573 --> 01:28:10,813
And we were determined to get you here.

779
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:12,933
Notice how we led you to believe...

780
01:28:13,133 --> 01:28:18,333
...that your daughter would be sacrificed
due to the failure of the crops last year.

781
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,253
But they did fail. l saw the photo.

782
01:28:20,453 --> 01:28:23,973
Yes, they failed, all right.
Disastrously so.

783
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:27,013
One of the few times
since my ancestors moved here.

784
01:28:27,893 --> 01:28:32,493
But we are always prepared
with a powerful sacrifice.

785
01:28:33,173 --> 01:28:37,253
And that, my friend, is your destiny.

786
01:28:37,453 --> 01:28:39,333
-lt is your destiny.
-Back up!

787
01:28:40,133 --> 01:28:44,293
What we require is a stranger,
yet one who is connected to us.

788
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:46,333
-He's connected to us.
-He's connected to us.

789
01:28:46,573 --> 01:28:48,493
Connected by blood.

790
01:28:55,613 --> 01:28:57,373
Willow.

791
01:29:02,893 --> 01:29:05,093
Why have you done this to me?

792
01:29:06,813 --> 01:29:09,333
We orchestrated all of this
with the greatest care...

793
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:12,173
...everything that's happened.

794
01:29:12,493 --> 01:29:15,533
Be proud of yourself.
You have done so well.

795
01:29:15,773 --> 01:29:19,813
Yes. My daughter speaks the truth.

796
01:29:20,053 --> 01:29:26,093
Your fate was sealed many years ago
when she chose to be with you.

797
01:29:28,453 --> 01:29:30,293
Your daughter?

798
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:33,973
Yes. My Willow.

799
01:29:35,013 --> 01:29:38,973
This is a story whose chapters
were carefully written.

800
01:29:44,453 --> 01:29:48,013
You have been chosen
to die a martyr's death.

801
01:29:48,253 --> 01:29:52,733
You will sit beside the gods and goddesses
for all of eternity.

802
01:29:53,293 --> 01:29:56,333
Back up! l swear to God, l will shoot you!

803
01:29:56,613 --> 01:30:00,733
lt is a great honor,
one that you cannot refuse.

804
01:30:01,613 --> 01:30:03,133
lt is ordained.

805
01:30:04,013 --> 01:30:06,453
There is no way out.

806
01:30:06,653 --> 01:30:08,373
Stay back!

807
01:30:48,933 --> 01:30:50,373
You bitches!

808
01:30:52,373 --> 01:30:53,453
You bitches!

809
01:30:56,693 --> 01:30:59,613
This is murder! Murder!

810
01:30:59,813 --> 01:31:02,333
You'll all be guilty!

811
01:31:02,533 --> 01:31:04,773
And you're doing it for nothing!

812
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:08,293
Killing me won't bring back
your goddamn honey!

813
01:31:08,493 --> 01:31:10,093
But l know it will.

814
01:31:14,733 --> 01:31:16,653
Oh, God.

815
01:31:20,373 --> 01:31:21,413
How can it?

816
01:31:23,013 --> 01:31:25,573
l'm not one of you!

817
01:31:27,173 --> 01:31:28,773
l don't believe in your gods!

818
01:31:29,733 --> 01:31:32,293
l don't believe in sacrifice.

819
01:31:41,373 --> 01:31:43,413
Oh, God.

820
01:31:48,173 --> 01:31:50,733
No, don't-- Don't move me!

821
01:31:52,413 --> 01:31:54,733
What is it? What is it?

822
01:31:55,173 --> 01:31:57,173
What is that? What is that?
What is it?

823
01:31:57,853 --> 01:32:01,813
Oh, no. No, not the bees!
Not the bees!

824
01:32:03,533 --> 01:32:07,053
They're in my eyes! My eyes!

825
01:32:38,413 --> 01:32:40,733
We'll do it your way this time.

826
01:32:43,493 --> 01:32:46,053
l must keep you alive.

827
01:33:28,893 --> 01:33:30,653
Oh, God.

828
01:33:31,133 --> 01:33:35,413
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

829
01:33:54,053 --> 01:33:56,573
O gods and goddesses of nature.

830
01:33:59,293 --> 01:34:03,653
Receive this sacrifice and be appeased.

831
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:07,693
Gods and goddesses of nature.

832
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:11,933
Receive this sacrifice and be appeased.

833
01:34:52,613 --> 01:34:54,413

01:34:56,093 --> 01:34:58,173
No. Rowan!

835

No, Rowan, don't! Put it down! No!

836

Put it down!

837

Rowan!

838
01:35:10,813 --> 01:35:13,853
Put it down, honey. Put it down.

839

Rowan, no! No!

No!

841
01:35:36,733 --> 01:35:40,013
The drone must die!

842
01:35:40,213 --> 01:35:42,493
The drone must die!

843
01:35:42,853 --> 01:35:45,333
