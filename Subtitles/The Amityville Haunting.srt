00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,505
This is the house, man.
shot 'em all one by one in the head.

3
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,373
my god, it's so creepy.

4
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,809
come on, it's not that bad.

5
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,411
is there still stuff
in there?

6
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,413
yeah. apparently
when it all happened,

7
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,548
they just packed up and left.
they didn't even take

8
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,417
any of the furniture. it
was all just left there.

9
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,386
wait. so there's
still beds in there?

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,322
oh, yeah, there's
still beds in there.

11
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,689
maybe we should check it out.

12
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,291
yeah, we should
check it out. come on.

13
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,692
okay. come on.

14
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,130
what exactly happened?

15
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,531
i heard some really creepy
stuff about the whole thing.

16
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,266
i don't know.
dude was just crazy.

17
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,435
apparently when he was at
the police station,

18
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:09,537
he said it was just too
easy to kill 'em all.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,339
it was just
too easy to stop.

20
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,374
weren't they found on their stomachs
or something like that?

21
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,808
yeah. they were all,
like, flipped.

22
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,510
so, like,
laying face down.

23
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,112
that's disgusting.

24
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:19,380
hey! hey!

25
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,714
you ready yet?
come on.

26
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,283
relax.

27
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,717
dude, i thought you'd
be done by now. come on.

28
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,653
yeah, i've almost
got it, okay?

29
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,521
how do you know how
to do this, anyways?

30
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,123
my mom's a realtor.

31
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:32,160
so he's--
it's one of these codes, okay?

32
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:35,729
there's, like,
five universal codes and...

33
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,431
yes!

34
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,701
my name is donny reddit.

35
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,271
this may be the last time
i'm ever filming anything.

36
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,605
if you find this,

37
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,640
make sure you tell my mom
i love her.

38
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,908
actually, no.
tell her i hate her.

39
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,344
she's a bitch.
come on.

40
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,682
how creepy is this?

41
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,816
donny, how many people

42
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,251
did you say
were killed here?

43
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,886
i don't know.
like, four or something.

44
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,522
some guy went crazy and just, like,
killed his entire family.

45
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,856
how'd he do it?

46
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,793
he shot them while they
were sleeping in bed.

47
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,161
like, one by one.

48
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,296
what? what?
what the fuck is that?

49
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,398
did you see that?
did you see--

50
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,532
you guys are probably
just freaking out.

51
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,666
there's nothing
actually there.

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,835
oh, get out!
get out!

53
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,337
go fuck yourself,
okay?

54
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,206
have you-- how much
you been drinking, huh?

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,940
are you drunk yet?
are you completely--

56
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,643
i know. up front,
ooh, yeah, scary.

57
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,778
i'm going to explore her.

58
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,449
we've been in the rest
of the house.

59
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,651
haven't seen anything.

60
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,786
well, not anything.

61
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,955
yeah. i see something.

62
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,558
let's get
the party started.

63
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,763
oh, my god.
this is so creepy.

64
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,267
i like the light on better.

65
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,538
i wonder if somebody died
in here.

66
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,965
oh, look at that.

67
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,700
did you see this clock?

68
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,302
i'm almost done. yeah.

69
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,670

73
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,516
i can't believe it.

74
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,019
oh, my god.

75
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,522

and we have
sergeant tyler here.

87
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,362
just don't bother him.

88
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,663
he thinks he's the
next steven spielberg.

89
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,831
he films everything.

90
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,032
oh, don't we all. yeah.

91
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,667
and my oldest
daughter lori.

92
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,404
lori, off the phone,
please. now.

93
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,742
get the fuck
out of my face.

94
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,978
okay. let's take
a look around.

95
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,549
great.
just so you guys know,

96
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,584
we do have some other
places available to show you

97
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,852
if you would be
interested in those.

98
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,053
oh, i think i would
be very interested.

99
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,488
i don't think that'll
be necessary.

100
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,089
i have a good feeling
about this one.

101
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,858
after you.

102
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,861
okay, then-- stop.

103
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,496
right this way.

104
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,997
all right.
let's go, troops.

105
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,067
go. come on.

106
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,672
so you guys can see

107
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,740
actually it needs a little
bit of a paint job.

108
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:09,009
that's completely at your
discretion, obviously.

109
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,511
it's perfect.

110
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,581
great. then let's take

111
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,082
a little bit more
of a look at the place.

112
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,850
tyler.

113
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,520
very nice open floor plan.

114
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,121
honey, here is
your gourmet kitchen.

115
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,090
this house
sucks balls.

116
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,596
are you out
of your mind talking like that?

117
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,598
i don't know--
douglas.

118
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,700
do you understand me?
douglas.

119
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:37,771
get out of my face.

120
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:40,374
just tell me
what this is.

121
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:41,909
that's something
i'm gonna fix.

122
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,977
absolutely.
it's perfect.

123
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,479
look at these counters.

124
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:47,648
it's nice. yeah.

125
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,849
it's-- i love it.

126
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,651
it feels like home to me.

127
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,420
it feels like home.

128
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,087
there's space for a garden.

129
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,689
we could have a garden.

130
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:56,857
a football field mainly.

131
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,058
okay.
a little garden.

132
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,027
well, there could be a football
field there, but over here--

133
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,696
the tire swing comes with
the house, i imagine.

134
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,131
does the tire swing
come with the house?

135
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,600
yes. it comes
with the house.

136
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,136
how do you guys feel
about the house?

137
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,471

161
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,687

162
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,223

163
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,758
what happened here, okay?

164
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,994
we don't want it to
seem worse than it looks.

165
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,732
this is what we can
afford right now, okay?

166
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,468
i understand that.

167
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:16,136
i mean,
it has enough bedrooms.

168
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,605
i know, i know, i know.

169
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,740
okay. if it's--
for the money,

170
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,075
it's exactly--
it's all we can get.

171
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,077
we can't move anymore.

172
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,646
okay.
this is it.

173
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,583
okay.
okay.

174
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:30,784
are you all right
with it?

175
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,586
i'm all right with it.

176
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,588
i'm sure.
i love you.

177
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:35,956
i love you, too.

178
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,859
we're home!

179
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,961
yay!

180
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,777
oh, my god!

181
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,078

182
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,980

183
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,214
call 911. just do it.

184
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,651
go on, do it.

185
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,891
hey, mom.

186
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,893
hey, honey.

187
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,162
i'm really not in the mood
for the camera today, okay?

188
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,597
you should be
helping someone

189
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,965
and not playing
with the camera.

190
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,900
enough with the camera.

191
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,301
off, please.

192
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,903
yes, ma'am.

193
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,040
make yourself useful, son.

194
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,876
yes, sir.

195
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,160
hey, what are you doing?

196
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,898
i was just talking
to my friend.

197
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,034
his name is john.

198
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,135
oh.

199
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,943
john matthews.

200
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,312
you know he's not
really there, right?

201
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,914
there's no one there.

202
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,182
but i saw him.

203
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,317

yeah.
it's the new home.

207
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,128
we have to keep moving

208
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,329
because she keeps
getting in trouble.

209
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,731
will you knock it off?

210
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,633
is that right?
what'd you do?

211
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,835

being a twerp.

like i said, the tires.

230
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,937
i mean, that's
really kicking ass.

231
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,140
so i have, like, probably 16
inch, like, tires around.

232
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,709
yeah.

233
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,310
hey, you guys

234
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,645

235
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,313
do you know
what house this is?

236
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,648
it's your house.

237
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:15,749
it's the amityville house.

238
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,785
amityville house?
what's that?

239
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,320
you don't know what
the amityville house is?

240
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,055
you know what
the amityville house is?

241
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,692
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
the amityville house.

242
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,393
that's where
they make those cookies.

243
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,828
cookies.

244
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,096
no, it's supposed
to be haunted.

245
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,298
haunted? really?

246
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,200
better get out of here.

247
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,435
yeah. 'cause
everybody knows

248
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,405
that haunted houses,
black people die first.

249
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,440
so you better
get out of here.

250
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,142
hit the road, pal.

251
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,247
no, for real, man?
amityville, for real?

252
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,749
what is that?

253
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,852
gentlemen, i want this
wrapped up by 1400.

254
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,922
move it. come on, move.

255
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,123
ugh.

256
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,791
so why'd you get
that tattoo?

257
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,793
sat down.
the tattoo?

258
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,162
you're a little too young
for that, kid.

259
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,920
yeah. so i think this
is the last of it.

260
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:03,256
we probably should go
ahead and get on out of here.

261
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,792
i'm ready
to get out of here.

262
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,393
these guys are so lame.
what are they doing?

263
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,431
aha. aha.
did you see that?

264
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,000
i told you it was haunted.

265
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,137
really? just walk away?

266
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,738
come on.

267
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,275
the movers are so stupid.

268
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,444
why would they carry, like,
four boxes at a time

269
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,746
that are so heavy?

270
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,550
what?

271
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,485
are you going to move?

272
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,556
uh, no. i'm making
a documentary.

273
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,891
why are you so grumpy?

274
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,994
i'm working.
now move!

275
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,529
sorry.

276
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,240
that guy is such a jerk.

277
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,178
whoa. my sister's door
just opened.

278
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,013
let's go investigate.

279
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,443
ahh.

280
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,968
that goes in the study.

281
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,576
i'm starting to see what
you mean about this house, kid.

282
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,978
it sucks.

283
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,052
dad!

284
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,256
hey, mom.

285
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,590
oh, god.

286
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,994
tyler, i'm really not
in the mood right now.

287
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,630
but, mom--
but, mom, what?

288
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,498
it's for my documentary.

289
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,602
honey, it's just not
a really good time.

290
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:33,140
but, mom, please?

291
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,347
do you think
the house is haunted?

292
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,016
no. no, i don't think
the house is haunted.

293
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,152
i just think i didn't
want to live here.

294
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,419
i told your dad

295
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:49,289
i wanted to keep looking
at other places,

296
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,523
and your dad insisted,

297
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,492
and i just didn't feel
like this place

298
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,995
was a good fit for us,
for our family.

299
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,329
but two people died.

300
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,665
i know that. that's
what i'm trying to say.

301
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,134
god.

302
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:03,603
that's why i asked
if it was haunted.

303
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,040
honey, let's stop
talking about hauntings, okay?

304
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,276
just take
your camera and go.

305
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,477
i'm not in the mood
to be interviewed.

306
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,912
i'm sorry. just... okay.

307
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,301
it's still 5:00.

308
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,137
what the heck.
dad needs to fix it.

309
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,976
doug. doug.

310
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,311
what?

311
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,280
what? can we talk about
what happened today?

312
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,016
honey, calm down, okay?

313
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:49,983
i am calm.

314
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,551
this is about as calm as
i can get right now.

315
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,685
i'm sorry.

316
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,022
sweetheart,
what's going on?

317
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,757
what's going on?
a man died--

318
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,559
i am trying to stay calm.

319
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,194
i'm trying to
stay calm for you,

320
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,595
i'm trying to stay calm
for these kids,

321
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,032
but there's a man--
a man died here today.

322
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,234
honey, accidents-- in
this house, in our house.

323
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,036
honey, accidents
happen, okay?

324
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,303
maybe you're used
to seeing accidents.

325
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,272
i'm not used to seeing
accidents, okay?

326
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,706
listen,
just calm down, okay?

327
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,042
you're going
to scare the kids.

328
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,210
they can hear you.

329
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,612
i'm going to scare
the kids?

330
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,414
a man died
in this house.

331
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,715
the realtor died.

332
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,717
what am i supposed
to tell lori and mel?

333
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,154
listen, you're letting
this get to your head.

334
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,388
accidents happen.

335
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,689
the realtor
had an aneurism out front.

336
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,158
what are you
talking about?

337
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,425
i'm not letting
anything get to my head.

338
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,427
people fall down.
the man fell down.

339
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,330
the kids are asking--
calm down. jesus.

340
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,167
the kids
are asking questions.

341
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,334
what am i
supposed to tell them

342
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,569
when they ask me
questions

343
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,037
about what happened
to that man?

344
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,372
honey, accidents happen.

345
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,274
is that all you can say
is accidents happen?

346
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,276
because it does.
i don't like it here!

347
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,677
i don't feel
comfortable here!

348
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,280
you need... i don't
like it here!

349
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,614
i told you i didn't
want to live here!

350
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,383
i told you we should
keep looking,

351
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,052
and you said no,
it had to be here.

352
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,220
it does have to be here,

353
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,123
and you know why
it has to be here.

354
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,491
you know
we have to live here.

355
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,658
why?

356
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,427
this is what we can do.

357
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,696
this is what our means
can afford right now.

358
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,265
i don't like it.

359
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,834
sweetheart, come here.

360
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,436
it's not right.

361
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,438
it's okay.
it's not okay.

362
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,673
it is.
that's just coincidence.

363
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,175
these things happen, okay?

364
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,843
that's such crap!
it's this house!

365
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,179
shh! calm down.
it's this house!

366
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,715
you think that the house made
the guy fall down?

367
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,517
i don't know.
i don't know.

368
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,719
you think the house made lori act
funny and cry in her room?

369
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,621
that's like
every other day, okay?

370
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,490
do you think the house
made tyler act a little funny?

371
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,592
i am sorry, but a man
dying in my house

372
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,494
does not happen
every other day.

373
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,230
there's probably 100 people
that died in this house.

374
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,697
oh, my god. what
are you talking about?

375
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,233
it's a 150-year-old house.
you tell that to mel.

376
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,734
why don't you go
in her room right now

377
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,136
and tell that to her!

378
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,337
that it's
completely normal!

379
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,504
mel loves it here.

380
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,373
to have dead people
in your house!

381
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,477
i'm sorry. it's crap.

382
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,750
i don't feel right here.

383
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,455
what do you suggest we do?

384
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,358
i want to go
someplace else.

385
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,894
i want to keep looking.

386
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,596
please.

387
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,166
come here. sit down.

388
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,672
i don't like this place.

389
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,375
i know, honey.

390
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,680
can you give it
a few more days?

391
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,582
i promise,
everything's fine.

392
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,851
i promise. all right?

393
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,587
i'm sorry.

394
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,289
i'll give it
a few more days.

395
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,723
please.

396
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,192
but after that--

397
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,326
okay. would you do it for me?

398
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,695
yes.
just trust me.

399
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,550
you fucking
little pervert.

400
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,219
get the fuck
out of my room.

401
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,756
i'm really sorry about what
your brother did.

402
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,291
that was not fair.

403
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,293
mom, he was standing in
the crack of my door.

404
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,661
i know, honey.

405
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,463

406
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,465
i know. listen,
i will talk with your dad.

407
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,335
we'll make sure it
doesn't happen again, okay?

408
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,204
honey, i know today has
been a really awful day.

409
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,872
it's been a very
upsetting day. i'm sorry.

410
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,207
i just want to go home.

411
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,276

412
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,544
mom, no.

413
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,546
yeah. come on, honey.

414
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:43,216
we all have to try our
best to make it work here.

415
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,287
i'm sorry, but we really
all have to put in 100 %, okay?

416
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,888
mom, someone died
here today.

417
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,523

418
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,960
i'm sorry. i'm so sorry that
you had to see that.

419
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,705
we have some watermelon.

420
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:10,243
we have eggs, so we can make
a hard boiled egg,

421
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,613
and we also have
some peanut butter.

422
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,915
we have carrots,

423
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,320
and we also have
some avocado

424
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,654
to make a dip

425
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,257
for you to dip
some chips in.

426
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,660
so we've--and if you want
something to drink,

427
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,663
we also have
some sprite.

428
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,965
we have
a fruit-flavored punch.

429
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,935

cherry-strawberry flavor.

430

432
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,279
if you want me to bake you some
cookies or something.

433
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,983
we just survived our first day
in the amityville house.

434
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,685
creepy.

435
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,922
when our realt or showed
us the house that day,

436
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:59,892
she died from
an an-an-aneurism.

437
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,862
and then, like,
today the mover,

438
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,497
he was carrying
a really heavy box,

439
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,899
fell down the stairs and
it landed on his head.

440
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,968
it just killed him.
it was weird.

441
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,940
my closet door just opened.

442
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,386
nobody's in there.

443
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,820
aah!

444
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,525
what?

445
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,527
you didn't, like,
accidentally...

446
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:37,830
the door shut or something?

447
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,066
no. when i went to bed,
the door was closed.

448
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,501
it was locked.

449
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,702
you know it was open
this morning.

450
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,504
wide open.
i was up at 4:00 a.m.

451
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:45,905
really? that's weird.
i don't know.

452
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,039
it wasn't you?

453
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,675
no, honey.
it wasn't me.

454
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,777
well, you know
what it is.

455
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,045
what?
lori snuck out.

456
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,514
no.

457
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,783
lori snuck out.
no, honey. no.

458
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,050
the door was wide open.

459
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,619
that little monster

460
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,654
forgot to shut the
door when she came back in.

461
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:02,922
we just got here.

462
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,657
where would she go?

463
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:05,825
she doesn't even know
anyone.

464
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,093
excuse me.

465
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,530
that kid with the dogs.

466
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,932
that boy who came
with the dogs.

467
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,066
the boy with the dogs?

468
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,735
oh, my god.
gets here one day.

469
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,405
she meets one kid,
and she's out the window.

470
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,939
that better not be true.
i'm sorry.

471
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,508
it is true.
what else would it be?

472
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,010
well... i can't believe that.

473
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,778
good morning.
breakfast time.

474
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,414
it could've been tyler.

475
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,781
good morning, melanie. you
know how he likes--

476
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,450
good morning,
daddy.

477
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,552
tyler? i highly doubt
it. it could've been him.

478
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:33,820
my closet door
opened last night.

479
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,422
good morning, tyler.

480
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,561
she snuck out the door.
she snuck out.

481
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:42,762
what do you want to do?

482
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:43,896
why are you doing
that bowl?

483
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,398
it's for my friend.

484
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:47,534
well, your friend
doesn't need that much.

485

00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,170
yes, sir.
get over here.

653
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,437
turn that off,
pick up the tools,

654
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,572
get over here and--

655
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,441
there's something
on this phone.

656
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,010
i don't know what it is.

657
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,912
but i'm going to find
out what's on the phone.

658
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,180
hey, ladies.

659
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,082
how are you?
you look good.

660
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,449
how was the movie?

661
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,200
i'm tired of everybody not
believing me about my closet

662
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,935
and then today
the tool box fell

663
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,536
and my dad
blamed it all on me.

664
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,905
i'm just tired of it.

665
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,340
so i'm going to use
this camcorder

666
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,943
to videotape everything
that happens in my room tonight.

667
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,112
so i'm going
to go set it up.

668
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:54,954
i just hate it when
people don't believe me.

669
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,010
i can't wait for this ipod
to get charged

670
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,345
to show everybody the movie.

671
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,512
yes?

672
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:21,948
hey, honey.

673
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:23,382
it's time for dinner.

674
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,551
okay. but, mom, can you watch
this video, please?

675
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,953
what video?

676
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,955
there's a video
on this ipod.

677
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,190
here.

678
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,460
what am i watching?

679
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,128
there were some kids that
snuck into our house,

680
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:38,197
i don't know when,
and they--

681
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,331
oh, that is our house.

682
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,033
they were looking
for ghosts.

683
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,069
oh, honey, they're not
looking for ghosts.

684
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,403
yes, they are.

685
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,138
no, sweetie. they're
not looking for ghosts.

686
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:47,273
they're just playing around
with their cameras.

687
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,474
no, they aren't.

688
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,376
who else do we know that plays
around with their cameras?

689
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,144
they're not
looking for ghosts.

690
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,345
come on.
it's time for dinner.

691
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:56,082
but--
no, honey. dinner's ready, okay?

692
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,583
yes, ma'am.
come on.

693
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:20,272
so today when we woke up, the
back door was wide open.

694
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,974
my dad thinks
lori snuck out,

695
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:24,076
but then he started
apologizing to her

696
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,744
and he put this
alarm system in

697
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,147
because he thought
that old houses

698
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,182
don't have alarm systems,
so he put that in.

699
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:32,418
i think it's because of
lori, but he doesn't.

700
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,053
i don't know.

701
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:37,189
and then tonight for
dinner, mel was throwing a fit

702
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:41,493
because mom wouldn't
give her 'friend' dessert.

703
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,030
so that was awkward.

704
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,254
whoa! it's 3:15.
this is when it all started.

705
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:29,401
tyler! get upstairs! now!

706
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,203
okay.

707
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:32,704
okay.
go!

708
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:40,412
whoa. what the heck?

709
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,786
someone must've tried
to break in,

710
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:53,225
and i guess the alarm
scared him off.

711
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,798
that was just so weird.
it all happened at 3:15

712
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,134
like the original
amityville house thing.

713
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:05,137
that was just so weird.

714
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:10,242
what the... what is it doing?

715
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,155
whoa.

716
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:30,162
what are they doing?

717
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:43,775
why are they looking at
allthe stoves and stuff?

718
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,515
whoa, never seen
that before.

719
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:52,484
wonder where this came from.

720
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:59,558
what the... what-- what's--
what's hap--

721
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:02,261
what? no, no.

722
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:04,196
what? no.

723
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,665
what--
what's it doing?

724
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,235
come on, work. work.

725
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:20,912
we've been in
the rest of the house

726
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:22,314
and haven't seen it.

727
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,283
oh, my god.
is that our kitchen?

728
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:25,617
yes,
that's our kitchen.

729
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:26,785
yes, that's the kitchen.
that's our kitchen.

730
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:28,487
yes. yes, it is.

731
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,289
does she have beer?
is that beer? that's beer.

732
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:31,823
i don't know.
just keep watching.

733
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,292
i'm not
exactly sure--

734
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:34,693
who is this kid?
do you know this kid?

735
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,262
lori, do you know him?

736
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,929
you don't know him?
no, i don't know him.

737
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:38,864
i'm positive.
you're sure?

738
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,566
all right, all right.
she doesn't know him.

739
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,967
yeah, that's our house.

740
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,303
there's the clock.
there's the clock.

741
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,439
you videotaped this
on your phone?

742
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:48,974
when did this happen?

743
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,309
yes, but
just keep watching.

744
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,477
yeah, when was this?

745
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,279
tyler, where'd you get
this video?

746
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,946
i found it.
just keep watching.

747
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,415
yes.

748
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,949
oh! oh!
oh, my god.

749
00:36:57,983 --> 00:37:00,552
you know what?
this is ridiculous.

750
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,554
tyler.

751
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,990
something happened to
them. just keep watching.

752
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,426

00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:08,560
just keep watching.

754
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:10,962
something happens to them.

755
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:13,465
nothing happens. they're just
screwing around.

756
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:15,301
yeah, they're just playing
around the rest of the time.

757
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,303
tyler. how long
have you had this?

758
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:20,372
how long-- just keep--
this is our kitchen.

759
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:21,473
it's not fair.
you don't believe me.

760
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:22,708
something did
happen to them.

761
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,842
honey, we know
something happened,

762
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,277
but it's none
of your business.

763
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,678
okay, enough of this.
enough of this.

764
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,414
tyler, we've got
a job to do today.

765
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,816
we're checking
for security breaches.

766
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,284
let's walk the perimeter.

767
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:33,719
i really want this gone.

768
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,454
i don't want you to have
it anymore, okay? tyler.

769
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:36,588

770
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:37,823

yes, ma'am. yes, sir.

773
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,976
what are we
doing this for, dad?

774
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,980
someone broke into our house
last night, tyler.

775
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,583
how do you know it was
someone and not something?

776
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:08,019
hmm. it's got a grate.
it's not that bad.

777
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,889
like a ghost.
what if it was a ghost?

778
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,891
tyler, cut it out,
will you?

779
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:17,095
how come everybody else gets
to do what they want?

780
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,802
can i please go do
something else? please?

781
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:26,538
tyler, we're working
today, all right?

782
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:28,907
so i need you
to cooperate, okay?

783
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,578
dad, dad, look at all the
flies on the window.

784
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,845
tyler, quit
screwing around.

785
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,080
but, dad--

786
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,115
do you want to chop
woodtill december?

787
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,884
why don't we just buy wood?

788
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,586
do you want to chop woodtill
december starting today?

789
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,554
no, but we could just buy
wood. i didn't think so.

790
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:54,833
john matthews, do
you think that you like

791
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:58,003
the little star clips that
i put in his ears?

792
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,439
mel, honey.
what, daddy?

793
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,710

to john matthews

797
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,716
for the past few days,

798
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,851
and i haven't
told her anything.

799
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,553

her little friend.

802
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,625

803
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,993

tell you the truth?

804
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,995

805
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,997

about john matthews?

810
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,141
nobody told me
about him, daddy.

811
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,109
he's sitting right here.

812
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,484
he's my friend
and he told me

813
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,686
that he used to live
in this house

814
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,788
and he was nine.

815
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:01,433
what else
does he tell you?

816
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:03,902
i can't tell you.
it's a secret.

817
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,461
honey, we're just concerned

818
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:32,864
because daddy saw mel talking
to an imaginary friend

819
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,501
whose name was john matthews.

820
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:36,902
we're just wondering

821
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,904
if maybe you accidentally
said something?

822
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,872
you know,
john matthews is the guy,

823
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:42,941
the little boy that used
to live in this house.

824
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,610
dad, like i'd say
anything about that.

825
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:46,044
i didn't even know that.

826
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,714
well, maybe you were
just chatting with, like, mom

827
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:49,981
or chatting with that kid

828
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,216
you met the other day
with the dogs.

829
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,718
no. i haven't even
talked to that kid.

830
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,019
honey, you don't have
to get defensive.

831
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,253
we're not accusing you.

832
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,722
you guys are accusing me.

833
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:57,756
you always accuse me.

834
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,725
will you listen to me?
i'm not accusing you, honey.

835
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:02,127
we're just asking if maybe
you said something

836
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,896
to one of your friends, maybe
that guy with the dogs.

837
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,765
no. i didn't say anything.

838
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:07,966
we're trying to figure out

839
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,501
how mel found out
about this stuff.

840
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:11,036
she's out there--

841
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,638
yeah, that'sa good question,
dad, but it wasn't me.

842
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,640
okay. well, you can
calm down, all right?

843
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:16,174
please don't get so defensive.

844
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,843
i'm not.

845
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:18,977
you're being
defensive, honey.

846
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,178
i am not, dad.

847
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,547
just calm down.

848
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,281
i'm just asking
a simple question.

849
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,783
were you and tyler
discussing it?

850
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,884
did you say something
to tyler?

851
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,118
no. i haven't
talked to tyler.

852
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,654
he's been annoying
the crap out of me.

853
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:30,288
i know. i know.
he's annoying everyone.

854
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,023
he's going crazy.
we're worried about that.

855
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:36,161
maybe she just heard you--
tyler! tyler!

856
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,497
tyler, you've gotto be
kidding me. mom! -tyler!

857
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,622
hey, mom.

858
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,123
hey, honey.

859
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:08,727
i'm here to talk to you
about that camera.

860
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,729
do you think you can
get it out of my face?

861
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:11,930
yes.

862
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,665
thank you.

863
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,201
honey, look, i know
that you're bored.

864
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,636
i know that there
just doesn't seem

865
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,304
to be a lot of stuff
to do around here,

866
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,907
but the camera's
making things worse.

867
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,209
you're always
in everyone's face.

868
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:28,146
you really need
to lay off lori, okay?

869
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,615
she's a young woman.

870
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:30,916
she needs her privacy.

871
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,053
okay, mom. i'll try.

872
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:37,188
do you promise?
i promise. i promise.

873
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:44,122
douglas!

874
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,692
yeah. be right there.

875
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:04,442
today it was weird.

876
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,445
first, my dad had us
checking for security breaches

877
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,048
because of last night.

878
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:13,785
and then mel, she was just
being weirder than usual.

879
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,887
she had a full conversation

880
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:18,189
with her little friend
john matthew,

881
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:21,026
and my dad, i think
he finally believes me.

882
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,327
she's talking to somebody.

883
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,396
and then lori, she got me
in trouble today

884
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,965
just 'cause
i was spying on her.

885
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,399
who cares? everybody
gets spied on

886
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:31,336
every once in a while by
their brother or sister.

887
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,805
and i got lectured
because of that.

888
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,207
nobody knows what it's like
being a kid,

889
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,810
except for kids, that is.

890
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,345
it's just not fair.

891
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,948
my parents don't even
know what i'm going through.

892
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,451
it sucks.

893
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,241
doug?

894
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:11,843
honey?

895
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,180
doug.

896
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:18,817
doug.

897
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,085
what?

898
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:22,053
you coming up to bed?

899
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:25,490
are the kids tucked in?

900
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:28,960
yeah, the kids
are tucked in.

901
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:32,097
i'm just going to read for
a little bit, okay?

902
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,231
okay.

903
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,499
i'll be right up.

904
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,468
it's not good to read
in such low light.

905
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,817
gotcha!

906
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:27,185
what are you doing
in my house?

907
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,588
what are you
fucking doing?

908
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,090
you know this guy?
you know this guy?

909
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,358
what's going on?

910
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,961
lori! lori!
go get inside.

911
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:37,362
i'm so sick of this.

912
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:38,930
i am tired of it.

913
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:42,868
you stay away
from my daughter, boy.

914
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,035
you hear me?

915
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:45,503
i'll blow you
to pieces right now.

916
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:46,838
i'm sorry.

917
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:47,973
stay away from my family.

918
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:50,241
get the hell
out of here now.

919
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:51,977
move it. move!

920
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,112
see you later, loser.

921
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,159
dad?

922
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:57,475
dad. dad, what happened?

923
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,210
get inside. we're
calling the cops.

924
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:00,445
what?

925
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,684
my dad was right
and so was i.

926
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,287
lori was the one
sneaking out.

927
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,957
it was a weird night.

928
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,993
greg comes in, lori's
got to sneak out...

929
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:19,998
and my dad almost
killed him with a gun.

930
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:22,000
that was kind of funny.

931
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:28,606
he gets ready to get
kicked out and leave,

932
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,142
and he gets yanked out.

933
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:34,279
he goes off the ground
and everything.

934
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:37,648
it was scary.

935
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:39,484
that's scarier
than everything else.

936
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,055
it's just, it's just...

937
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,169
son, where's your dad?

938
00:48:58,203 --> 00:48:59,570
he's over there.

939
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:04,275
hey, gunny.

940
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:05,710
hey, how's it going?

941
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,712
it's good.

942
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:09,647
i'm sorry you're
going through all this.

943
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,282
that's all right.

944
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:13,551
i went around the perimeter
of the whole house

945
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,520
and i couldn't find
anything.

946
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:18,523
i went through the bushes,
under the tables, everything.

947
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,325
through the trees.
nothing.

948
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:25,130
so what else
are you seeing here?

949
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:27,698
well, this kid broke
into the house tonight.

950
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:29,434
it's that kid, isn't it?

951
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,102
it's a kid.
i don't know his name.

952
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:33,104
greg. is he-- greg?

953
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:34,372
i think it's greg.

954
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,508
my daughter, you know,
we're new here.

955
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:39,377
she met this guy greg.

956
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,578
she turned off the alarm.

957
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:43,081
she left the back door
open for him.

958
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:44,582
she did it
the night before, too.

959
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:45,616
okay.

960
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,085
i came down at 4:00
in the morning.

961
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:48,519
i got up to do my workout

962
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:50,255
and the door
is wide open.

963
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:51,522
i don't know
if he came in.

964
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:52,757
i don't know what happened.

965
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,660
but tonight i stayed up.
i caught him.

966
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:57,162
okay. let me tell you
something about this kid.

967
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:58,563
i chased him
out the front door.

968
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,298
let me tell you something
about this kid, okay?

969
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,167
this kid's trouble.
he is?

970
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,368
yes. he's done this
many times

971
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:04,702
with girls around
the neighborhood.

972
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,171
he breaks in.

973
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:07,338
it figures.

974
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,307
and he plays around
with the girls

975
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,442
and he causes a whole
bunch of trouble.

976
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:14,179
well, my daughter's...
notorious.

977
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:18,316
we've moved five times in
the past 18 months--

978
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,584
you moved five times?

979
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:20,718
we've moved five times.

980
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:21,619
okay.

981
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,321
so this is pretty much
it for us right now.

982
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,755
i mean,
we're staying here.

983
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:27,458
but, i mean, it's already
starting up, so...

984
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:28,793
but i chased him out.
he's not coming back.

985
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:30,361
i mean, if he knows
what's best for him,

986
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:31,462
he's not coming back.

987
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:33,431
a lot of people scare this
kidand he still comes back.

988
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,066
so just be wary of that,

989
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,335
but i don't think you
have anything to worry about.

990
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,804
so what i'll do--
since it's night,

991
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:41,806
i'll come back tomorrow morning and
look around in daylight

992
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,374
to see if there's
anything i can find

993
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:44,642
just to double check for you

994
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:45,843
to make sure that
you're okay with that.

995
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,178
that'd be great.

996
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:48,579
all right?
all right, buddy.

997
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:50,315
so i'm gonna take off.

998
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:51,716
i'll be here about 9:00 in
the morning tomorrow.

999
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:53,351
perfect. okay.
i'll give you a call before--

1000
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,485
call me before.

1001
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:55,720
i'm on my way
over here. okay?

1002
00:50:55,753 --> 00:50:57,488
i appreciate it, man.
no problem.

1003
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:58,756
have a good one.
appreciate it.

1004
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,325
all right.
thanks for coming out.

1005
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:01,692
no problem, gunny.

1006
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,368
i did a search around the
perimeter of your house,

1007
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:14,205
and i found a substantial
amount of blood.

1008
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,340
what?

1009
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:16,607
there's blood back there.

1010
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,875
yes.

1011
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,577
what the hell?

1012
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:23,681
so i'm going to refer
this to a detective.

1013
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:26,351
well, what--was it--
there was a struggle?

1014
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,219
i can't go into any more
detail than that.

1015
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,620
but you didn't see
a struggle?

1016
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:31,489
i really can't go
into any more detail

1017
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:34,125
because it's not
my department.

1018
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:35,726
i have to refer it
to a detective.

1019
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,595
so you can't
tell where the blood's from?

1020
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:38,829
i have no idea.

1021
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:40,198
he said there's clothes.
is that right?

1022
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,399
there was a shirt.

1023
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,533
was it torn up?
i mean--

1024
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:43,768
i really can't
go into more

1025
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:45,170
because i don't know.

1026
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:46,537
i mean, there's clearly
an attack.

1027
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:49,207
i don't want to get
you guys riled up or upset

1028
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,210
because-- let's just have a
detective come in,

1029
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:54,379
and he'll do
his investigation, okay?

1030
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:55,713
okay.

1031
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:56,881
a pool of blood?

1032
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,216
can i talk
to you guys outside?

1033
00:51:58,249 --> 00:51:59,350
yeah.
yeah.

1034
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:00,751
tyler, god.
tyler.

1035
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:01,919
turn the camera off.

1036
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,854
turn it off.
i want to listen, too.

1037
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:07,725
so i'm going to have
the detective

1038
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:09,560
call you guys
this afternoon, okay?

1039
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:11,162
i'm going to be
on top of this.

1040
00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:13,298
i'm going to be following
upon all this for you,

1041
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:14,765
giving you updates,

1042
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,568
but he's going to handle the
investigation from here.

1043
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:19,337
dna and that type of thing.

1044
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,738
great.
forensics, okay?

1045
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:21,939
oh, also i'm going to be--

1046
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,608
it was just
a pool of blood?

1047
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,843
just a pool of blood.
- thank you, john.

1048
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,846
there weren't tracks
or anything.

1049
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,381
what the hell?

1050
00:52:30,415 --> 00:52:31,682
i have no idea.

1051
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:33,284
that's fine.

1052
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:36,687
so, john, let's give him
a bath after this.

1053
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:38,456
come on, help me get this
stuff out of his fur.

1054
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,624
would you please
give me the tape?

1055
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,626
will i get it back?

1056
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,229
get the tape.
sorry about that.

1057
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:46,364
- not a problem.
- listen, i just want you to know

1058
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:47,498
we appreciate
what you're doing.

1059
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:48,899
i mean, i know this is--

1060
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:50,501
now the get the hair
away from his eyes.

1061
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:51,936
we're really frazzled.
- i understand.

1062
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,604
that's why i don't want
to go into more detail.

1063
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,206
'cause i don't know
what it is

1064
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,607
or i don't know
what it could be.

1065
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:57,875
so i just want to,
you know--

1066
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,544
let's just wait and see.

1067
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:01,479
tyler, i said turn the
goddamn camera off, all right?

1068
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:02,880
turn it off! now!

1069
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,349
off! off!

1070
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:06,484
i have one more
question, though.

1071
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,219
thank you so much.
no problem. i'll be in touch.

1072
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:09,620
like i said, if you need
anything, call.

1073
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:10,888
okay. thank you,
officer.

1074
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,223
no problem.

1075
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:13,324
oh.

1076
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:25,370
john, i think it's time

1077
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:28,873
for him to have
his bath now, don't you?

1078
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,641
who are you talking to,
sweetie?

1079
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,243
john.

1080
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:35,780
honey, are
you always talking to john?

1081
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:38,383
pretty much.
he's my friend, daddy.

1082
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:39,917
now, you know it's okay to
have imaginary friends,

1083
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,619
but you don't need
to talk to them--

1084
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:43,354
he's not
my imaginary friend.

1085
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:45,590
all the time. okay?

1086
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:47,692
he's sitting right there.

1087
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,362
how you doing?

1088
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:52,563
i'm good.

1089
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:54,365
i was just pushing him
on the swing.

1090
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:56,801
you are?
are you having fun?

1091
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:57,935
yeah.

1092
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,471
i love you.
thank you.

1093
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,366
hi. how's it going?

1094
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:30,635
good. go ahead
and take a seat.

1095
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:33,037
look, i wish i had more

1096
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,005
to tell you folks
at this time, but i don't.

1097
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:36,907
all forensics is telling me
right now

1098
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,877
is it is human blood, but
we don't got a body yet.

1099
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,612
we got nothing to go on.

1100
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:42,880
so all i can say is

1101
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,415
they're going to be
testing the results,

1102
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,384
taking them to the lab.
maybe one, two days,

1103
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:47,718
we'll have more of
an answer for you folks.

1104
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:48,919
all right.

1105
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,355
and before
i head out of here,

1106
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:51,989
i just want to
ask you both a question.

1107
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,624
and it's going to be
off the record,

1108
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:58,829
but has anything else
unexplainable happened here?

1109
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:04,469
well, our son felt
like that there was a--

1110
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:05,670
no, no.

1111
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:08,038
no, whoa, whoa.
what'd your son say?

1112
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:12,009
i mean, our son, he
runs around with a camera

1113
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,879
and films stuff,
and, you know,

1114
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:16,414
he say
she sees weird things,

1115
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:17,715
but there's really
nothing that has happened

1116
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:20,518
besides, i mean,
the stuff you know about.

1117
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,421
right. but in addition to
that, has anything else--

1118
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:25,623
well, there's--unexplain
able happened?

1119
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,892
i mean, this is some pretty
crazy stuff out there.

1120
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:33,531
what--what--
yeah. the alarm has gone off.

1121
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,065
the alarm has gone off.

1122
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:36,000
the alarm went off twice.

1123
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:37,668
any sign of a break-in or
anything like that?

1124
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:39,069
forced entry?

1125
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:41,439
no. the doors were open and
we had locked them.

1126
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,974
the doors were open
after you'd locked them both.

1127
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,511
besides last night, the
night before, i got up.

1128
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:48,112
as far as i know,

1129
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:49,680
we locked the doors
when we went to bed,

1130
00:55:49,714 --> 00:55:51,482
but i got up and the door
was wide open.

1131
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:52,850
these doors right here.

1132
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,887
the alarm went off,
you know,

1133
00:55:56,921 --> 00:56:00,625
last night
and the night before.

1134
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:03,828
at the same time.

1135
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,896
you folks aren't from
around here, are you?

1136
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,598
no.no.

1137
00:56:07,632 --> 00:56:11,669
no? but you're familiar with
the history of this house?

1138
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:12,770
i mean, generally.

1139
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:14,539
as far as the movies, the
books, everything like that?

1140
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:15,706
yeah.
of course.

1141
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,608
then you know what happened here
in the seventies, right?

1142
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:19,544
because that really happened.

1143
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,679
this kid named ronnie
defeooffed his ma, his pa,

1144
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,681
his two little brothers,
and his sisters.

1145
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,817
all right.
they killed six people.

1146
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,955
now, after that, the
book, the movie came out.

1147
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:32,122
you're all
familiar with that.

1148
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:36,494
but everyone thought
at some point

1149
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:39,430
that ronnie was
responsible for the murders...

1150
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,802
...that he wasn't
the one behind it.

1151
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:47,805
it was his sister
and some other accomplice.

1152
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,173
they don't know who
the third guy is,

1153
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,542
but it turns out
that ronnie defeo,

1154
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:52,977
according to this letter,

1155
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,745
was not responsible for the
killing of his family.

1156
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:56,213
it was his sister
who was responsible.

1157
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,884
now, this letter came
out, what, like, 1998, 1999,

1158
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,019
about 12, 11 years ago.

1159
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:05,823
and since that time,

1160
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:07,091
there have been eight
different families

1161
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:09,460
who lived in this house.

1162
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:11,896
and before that there
were maybe four or five,

1163
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,230
and we're talking
about 75 years

1164
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,899
of this house
being in this area.

1165
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,868
but within the last 12 years,

1166
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:20,037
there have been eight
different families who lived here.

1167
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,573
all right. so, okay.

1168
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:23,841
there's been eight
different families. so--

1169
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,976
but nothing
has happened to them.

1170
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:29,647
nothing has
happened to them, but...

1171
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,617
i don't think one family
has stayed here

1172
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,219
longer than one,
two months, maybe tops.

1173
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:36,754
did they give a reason
why they moved?

1174
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,188
no, just up and left.

1175
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:40,658
most of them even left their
deposits on the house.

1176
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,992
huh.

1177
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:43,227
you got the place
pretty cheap, didn't you?

1178
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,230
yeah.
yes.

1179
00:57:46,263 --> 00:57:48,232
you didn't give any more
thought about that,

1180
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:49,834
why it might be
so reasonable?

1181
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:51,736
well, we wanted
to think about-- honey.

1182
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,003
all right, look,

1183
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:55,005
i'm sorry i even
said anything. look--

1184
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,707
it's all right.
it's fine.

1185
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:58,576
the best thing
i can say right now

1186
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,911
is that we're going to find
out what we can with forensics

1187
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:03,581
and get back to you as
soon as possible, all right?

1188
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:04,715
we appreciate that.

1189
00:58:04,749 --> 00:58:05,850
thank you.
all right.

1190
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:07,117
thanks.
thanks, detective.

1191
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,053
if you need anything,
i'll be in here.

1192
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:11,622
just...

1193
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:13,891
you two knew the history of
this house, right?

1194
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:17,261
yeah.

1195
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:21,265
can i ask
an honest question?

1196
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:23,100
why'd you move here?

1197
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,052
they need
to fix that clock.

1198
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:53,564
so what did
the detective say, dad?

1199
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:57,067
we need, like, 15 cameras and
motion censors, infrared.

1200
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,435
was somebody murdered?

1201
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:05,710
they find anything?

1202
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:07,945
there was, like,
100 people out there.

1203
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:10,981
guns. god,
i hope we have time.

1204
00:59:18,623 --> 00:59:19,957
who are you
calling, dad?

1205
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:27,732
yeah. hey, cut,
this is gunny.

1206
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:30,234
i hate it when
my parents ignore me.

1207
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,770
yeah, save the small talk
for later, bud.

1208
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,204
i know it's been a while,

1209
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:36,807
but i've got a situation
i need you to come up for.

1210
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,178
today was kind of messed up.

1211
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,681
i've never seen so many cops
in my life.

1212
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:45,049
they were just all huddled

1213
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,852
and there was a bunch of
guys with suitcases.

1214
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,720
i overhear
done of them saying

1215
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:52,623
that there was just, like,
a puddle of blood.

1216
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:55,259
i don't know
what it was but...

1217
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,894
who's this guy?

1218
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,900
hey, sir, are you here
to help us?

1219
01:00:18,683 --> 01:00:21,051
my man, cut.

1220
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:22,319
oh, look at you, man.

1221
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,788
gunny.

1222
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:24,789
five years.

1223
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:25,923
oh, it's been a while.

1224
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,758
damn, it's good
to see you, man.

1225
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:28,926
nice house.

1226
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,895
oh, thanks.
dude, i'm telling you.

1227
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,362
you all right?

1228
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:34,031
man, i've got to tell you,
i've been better.

1229
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:35,132
really?

1230
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:36,366
yeah. i mean, i've got
a situation here.

1231
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,235
i'm glad you're here.

1232
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:39,904
did you hear about george?

1233
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:41,205
yeah, yeah.

1234
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:42,940
man, i would've done
anything to be there.

1235
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,742
yeah, i thought you were
going to beat the funeral.

1236
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:47,411
i've just been
caught up with--

1237
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:49,914
i got this-- i got
a thing going on, man.

1238
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:51,181
hey, hey, hey.

1239
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:52,850
look, i usually don't
hear from the boss

1240
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:54,251
until things
are real bad.

1241
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:55,720
yeah, they're bad.

1242
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:57,287
i got some shit going on.

1243
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,756
what's going on?

1244
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:00,424
i am damn glad to see you.

1245
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:03,060
so let me show you around,
all right?

1246
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:04,929
look, i got these--

1247
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:07,832
i mean, i pulled my gun
on a kid last night.

1248
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:10,067
my daughter--
a gang kid?

1249
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,836
no, not a gang kid.
he's a local kid.

1250
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,470
my daughter is just--
she's lost it.

1251
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,739
she's out of her mind.

1252
01:01:14,772 --> 01:01:15,873
right in here.

1253
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:17,441
she's out of her mind.

1254
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:19,243
she's sneaking out all the
time and stuff, i mean, but...

1255
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:21,445
who's telling you-- you mean
this kid broke in?

1256
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,447
yeah. i think he came in the
night before as well.

1257
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,049
he came in this back door
over here.

1258
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:27,051
with her or--
i don't know.

1259
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:28,418
i caught him last night.

1260
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,187
i mean, i scared the
bejeezus out of this kid.

1261
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,488
i pulled my gun.

1262
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,290
fucking scared his ass
out the front door.

1263
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:34,358
yes, i can see you.

1264
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:36,293
oh, that's
the gunny i know.

1265
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:43,067
whoa.
what is that stuff?

1266
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:06,156
i'm not
a trouble maker.

1267
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,157
this is not fair.

1268
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:08,492
yes, it is fair.

1269
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:11,428
and it's not your place
to say what's fair.

1270
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,431
i decide what's fair
or is not fair, okay?

1271
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,400
do you understand me?

1272
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,206
dad, i'm sorry.

1273
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,407
i know you're sorry.

1274
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,942
i've heard this before.

1275
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:27,011
i've heard this over and
over and over again.

1276
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:31,381
i just don't know what else
to do, all right?

1277
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,350
you've been doing this for
over two years now.

1278
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:35,853
you're just getting all--
- crap.

1279
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:39,189
off track.
it never changes.

1280
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:42,459

1282
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:52,269

1284
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:57,875
lori, don't lock
the door, all right?

1285
01:02:57,908 --> 01:02:59,409
this is going to happen whether
you like it or not.

1286
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:01,211
you can make it easy or
you can make it hard.

1287
01:03:01,245 --> 01:03:02,512
it's up to you.

1288
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:04,081

1295
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,392

1296
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:17,527
the wire again?

1297
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:28,038
whoa.

1298
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:47,958
what are you
filming me for, kid?

1299
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:49,093
crap.

1300
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,935
so how did you get
that cut on your face?

1301
01:03:57,968 --> 01:04:00,337
did you burn yourself?

1302
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:05,509
are you some kind
of paranormal investigator?

1303
01:04:09,113 --> 01:04:10,580
i'll ask
a different question.

1304
01:04:10,614 --> 01:04:14,618
how--are you
and my dad friends?

1305
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:19,623
yeah. i've known
your pop a long time.

1306
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:21,625
since before
you were born.

1307
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:27,097
so what's the camera for?

1308
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:30,467
well, you got people
breaking in.

1309
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,404
how do you know it's
someone and not something?

1310
01:04:34,438 --> 01:04:37,574
you know, like a ghost?

1311
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:44,581
are you going to help
us catch the ghost or not?

1312
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:48,618
ghost, huh?

1313
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:49,954
yes.

1314
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,991
there's some kind
of ghost in our house.

1315
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:55,993
tyler.

1316
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:56,994

1424
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:12,482
dad, what are you doing?

1425
01:14:18,555 --> 01:14:20,023
he's got some crosses.

1426
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:21,658
dad, what is this stuff?

1427
01:14:32,536 --> 01:14:34,470
what are the crosses for?

1428
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:41,645
look at this stuff.
what is it?

1429
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:45,181
i think my dad's
totally lost it.

1430
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:47,884
he's got crosses
and candles,

1431
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:49,185
a bunch of other stuff.

1432
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:52,021
i don't know what that is.

1433
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:53,590
see?

1434
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,566
he's going crazy.

1435
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,307
honey, what are you doing?

1436
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,309
this doesn't make
any sense.

1437
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,679
in two days we can go
to aunt linda's.

1438
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:17,213
doug, this
is not helping.

1439
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:18,815
mom,
he's fucking crazy.

1440
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:20,784
he's not going
to listen to you.

1441
01:15:20,817 --> 01:15:22,852
lori.

what are you doing?

1443
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,556
where did you even
