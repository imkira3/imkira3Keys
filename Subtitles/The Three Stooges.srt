in the equipment shed

00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,809
Will you please
go tell the boys to
come down for lunch?

I would, Mother Superior,
I swear I would,

00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:11,065
but the doctor told me
to steer clear of them
for a couple of weeks,

45
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,650
on account
of my nerves.

Oh, poor thing.
She has a toothache,
so she went to lie down.

she's asleep?

And would you look at all
that metal in her mouth.

1246
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,599
Ah, you're right.

1247
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:04,976
Come on, think.

1248
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,395
Where would we go
if we was Moe?

1249
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:12,733
Home.

1250
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,193
Yeah.

1251
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,904
(WHISTLES)

1252
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:25,246
Lord, I feel like
going home

1253
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,294
Where is everybody?

1254
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:38,342
I've tried and I failed
and I'm tired and weary

1255
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,055
Hello?

1256
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,725
Anybody home?

1257
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,937
ON TV: Hi, I'm Al Cerrone,
four-wheel drive SUVs just
like this,

1258
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,231
with a gas-saving,
six-cylinder engine,

1259
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:53,691
only $19,995.

1260
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:57,820
And pick-ups,
automatic and air,
only $16,000.

1261
01:00:58,739 --> 01:00:59,905
Sister Ricarda.

1262
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,994
Boys, what are you
doing here?

1263
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,330
We've been looking
everywhere for Moe.
Have you seen him?

1264
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,958
Yeah. I see him
almost every night on TV.

1265
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:13,961
He's on that Jersey
beach-people show.

1266
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,048
You didn't know?

1267
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,841
Moe's a big
celebrity now.

1268
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:19,925
Oh!

1269
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,345
Good for him.

1270
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,096
Yeah.

1271
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,516
Looks like he didn't
need us after all.

1272
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,437
So what happened here?
Where are all the kids?

1273
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,106
They're closing
us down on Monday,

1274
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,109
so we had to start
moving everyone out.

1275
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,070
But we told you to wait.
We were
going to get the money.

1276
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,237
You got the money?

1277
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:41,655
We got the money?

1278
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,115
Well, no,

1279
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,368
but we're working on it.

1280
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,452
Oh!
Oh!

1281
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,537
At least you tried.

1282
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,207
Peez!
Peez!

1283
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,836
Thank God
you're still here.

1284
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,380
They tried to
shoo me out,

1285
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,632
but I told them
I wasn't leaving
without her.

1286
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,093
Without who?

1287
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,844
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

1288
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:07,515
Murph?

1289
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,645
I'm sorry, boys,
Murph is very ill.

1290
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:15,523
Why isn't she
in a hospital?

1291
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:16,649
Well...

1292
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,567
MARY-MENGELE:
I'll tell you why.

1293
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:21,278
Because we don't have
any medical insurance.

1294
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:25,241
You should get some.
Just call that little
green alligator guy.

1295
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:28,494
Okay, that's it.
I've had it with you.

1296
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,664
Do you want to know
why we have no
medical insurance?

1297
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,209
It's because you wombats
have caused so many
accidents over the years,

1298
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,503
there's not a company
on this earth that will
cover us

1299
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:41,924
until we pay the $830,000
we owe for previous claims.

1300
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,468
And that's why we're
being closed down.

1301
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:45,719
That's enough, Sister.

1302
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:48,556
Wait. You mean the
orphanage is closing

1303
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,267
because of us?

1304
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:56,397
Check it out,
Larry, Curly,

1305
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:59,442
you're responsible
for that.

1306
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,403
You are and that
other moron.

No, no, I want it with

Shut up.

You, too.

or it's going belly up.

getting fitted
for angel wings.

so who do we sue?

no one to sue.

to give us the money.

I'm sorry, but I'm committed
to several other charities,

that kind of money
just laying around,

that we're both lazy bums

but we're not.

to get our hands dirty.

What? No.
I never thought
of Moe as lazy.

LARRY: It's all right.

1383

story about why you dropped
him back off.

Well, I can assure you
it had nothing to do
with his work ethic.

He was 10.

1386
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:49,838
No, what happened was,
he wanted us to go
back for you two,

1387
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,675
and frankly it was
just too much for us.

Wait. You mean

1389
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,681
he wouldn't go
without us?

1390
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,349
No, he wouldn't.

1391
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:04,478
He was very
adamant about wanting us
to adopt all three of you

1392
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,731
and it was just
out of the question,
you understand.
