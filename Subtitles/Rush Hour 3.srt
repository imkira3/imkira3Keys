00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,925
What The Hell! I didn't tell you to
go! God Damn! What's wrong with you?

3
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,600
Aw Man!... Ain't nobody listenin' to me?

4
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Ladies! You can visit here at any time for free.
I need to see your license and registration.

5
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:49,130
Brother, you okay? You cool?

6
00:01:56,175 --> 00:01:58,770
10 minutes, doors open on my signal.

7
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,475
I'm glad you're here, Lee! I always
feel better with you watching my back

8
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,845
I'm just doing my job, Mr. Ambassador

9
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,210
Stay close to me today
Lee, we're making history.

10
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:15,028
This is bullshit! You know who I am?

11
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:16,296
My family owns half of Rodeo drive!

12
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you know who I am?
Detective James Carter. L.A.P.D.

13
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,102
My family owns half of Crenshaw Blvd.

14
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:23,270
I want a lawyer

15
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:27,098
You need a personal trainer, it's like you're a
180 Ibs. you weigh more then the damn car, girl.

16
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,099
I have a Tyroid condition,

17
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:29,477
What's that mean Tyroid's?

18
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:33,805
Look... can't you just like
give us a warning or something?

19
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,342
That depends... you girls like Chinese?

20
00:02:39,377 --> 00:02:40,952
Excuse me.

21
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:42,380
Carter?

22
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:45,381
Lee, we're on for tonight, I just
picked up 2 girls, who wanna play hot...

23
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,382
with an Asian Policeman

24
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:49,830
I can't talk now, I'm in
the car with Ambassador Han.

25
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,100
Trust me. These girls are
sushi great, we gotta hit these!

26
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,366
I have to go, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:54,969
You're still mad at me aren't you?

28
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,172
You're mad because of what
happened when we was in New York.

29
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:58,339
I don't want to talk about that.

30
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,508
That was 3 years ago,
when you gonna let it go?

31
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,944
Let it go? Isabelle was my girlfriend.

32
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:05,412
Lee, we're friends man, just come
over here one night, the Wushu's on me.

33
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:09,579
Lee?

34
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:13,846
My mom says hi.

35
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:43,052
The Chinese Triads now
has a 1/2 million members,

36
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:44,892
In over one 100 countrys, and...

37
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:49,162
...these are not street kids,
shaking down local merchants.

38
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:55,122
These are buisness men, who build a $50 billion
empire on extortion, drugs, sex and slavery.

39
00:03:56,362 --> 00:04:01,326
We must cut off the head... of this
snake, before it swallows us whole.

40
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,135
As Chairman of the World Criminal Court, I
have intrusted my good friend, Ambassador Han...

41
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:10,172
to lead the Fight, against the largest
criminal organization in the world.

42
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:28,159
Ladies and Gentlemen.

43
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,260
The Triads society is build on secrecy

44
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:37,875
Nobody knows who these men are
who control them, who leads them.

45
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,576
Nobody has known for 500 years.

46
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:43,774
But today I stand before
you with a secret of my own.

47
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:48,684
Today I will disclose information
that effects everyone in this room.

48
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,587
After years of searching,

49
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:52,955
I believe I finally
located the Sha Xing.

50
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,662
Mr. Ambassador, Sha Xing is not exist.

51
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,463
Excuse me, who is this Sha Xing?

52
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:01,932
With all due respect, Sir. I like...

53
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,213
Everybody down!

54
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:15,792
- Call an ambulance!
- Someone get a doctor!

55
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,752
- Ambassador down!
- The Ambassador is down!

56
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,392
Stay with him!

57
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:54,412
Na... ah, ah, I'm keeping
these, 'till I see you tonight,

58
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:59,512
World authority, World Criminal Court
Bldg. The Chinese Ambassador has been shot!

59
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:02,272
Chinese Ambassador? - Move
your ass girl, move over! - Shit

60
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:43,891
Lee!

61
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:49,892
What the Hell is he doin'?

62
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:56,412
- L.A.P.D. get out of my way!
- Give us a brake.

63
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,750
Hey Lee, I'll get you when I come back,

64
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,772
Lee, I'm coming!

65
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:40,492
Don't move!

66
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:46,052
Hello, Lee.

67
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:56,257
Put your hands up, Kenji!

68
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:59,932
Lee, what're you waiting for? Shoot me.

69
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,332
Maybe this will help.

70
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:15,812
Drop the gun or I'll shoot!

71
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:19,372
I think we both know,
that's not gonna happen.

72
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:25,092
Kenji!

73
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:27,937
You see?

74
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:29,692
I know you too well.

75
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,932
Lee, you okay?

76
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:52,332
Lee, I all-most killed your
ass, why didn't you move?

77
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,492
I like you to meet our dates for
this evening, Marsha and Dora.

78
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:58,493
The Fat one's yours!

79
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:06,752
How many times you want
me to say it, I'm sorry...

80
00:09:06,753 --> 00:09:08,592
I'm sorry I ran you over, man, damn.

81
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:09,732
Not now all right... not now

82
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,752
All right, hold it right there.

83
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:12,792
Don't say a word Carter.

84
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,752
Capt. O'Neal, I had
nothing to do with this.

85
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:16,592
All I did was borrow a
car and backed up Lee.

86
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:17,912
Tell him partner.

87
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:19,672
I need to see Ambassador Han.

88
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:21,592
The Ambassador is just out of surgery.

89
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:23,872
The bullet missed his
heart. He's gonna be okay.

90
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:26,272
Capt'n, you have to give me back
my shield and put me on this case.

91
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,392
I made one little mistake,
take a brother of the bench.

92
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,792
One little mistake? You handcuffed
2 woman, and stole their car.

93
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:34,112
Isn't that why we have insurance?
Anyone has an off day Capt'n.

94
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:36,813
Last month you arrested 6 Iranians
and put them in jail for a week.

95
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:39,472
You and I both know them
Iranians was terrorist.

96
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:41,632
They were scientist at UCLA.

97
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,912
Big deal... 'cause they
cure cancer in rats...

98
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:45,832
that doesn't mean
they dont blow shit up!

99
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,552
Sir, let me find the person
who shot Ambassador Han.

100
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,392
Relax Carter, the L.A.P.D. will
be heading this investigation.

101
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:52,552
The Ambassador is my responsibility.

102
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:55,392
Then maybe you can tell me
exactly how the shooter got away.

103
00:09:56,472 --> 00:10:00,832
Also... the Ambassador's daughter is
coming here to see her father right now.

104
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,833
Make sure nothing happends to her!

105
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,792
Don't worry, Capt'n,
we gonna make you proud.

106
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,752
And try not to think about
your wife leaving you.

107
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,432
She'll come back.

108
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,992
Soo Yung's here? I haven't seen
her since she was 10 years old.

109
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,192
She lives here in Los Angelos now.

110
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:14,193
Let's go to the gift shop and
get her a little teddy bear,

111
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,250
In a bra...

112
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:21,712
Lee, I'm so glad you're here.

113
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:24,852
Detective Carter.

114
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:28,132
- It's been so long.
- So long... Soo Yung, so long.

115
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:31,972
- How is he?
- He is out of surgery.

116
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,812
They said he will be okay.

117
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:38,532
Soo Yung, I'm sorry.

118
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:42,852
It was my fault. I didn't
get to him fast enough.

119
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:49,212
I want you both... to
promise me something.

120
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:52,812
I want you to find the
man who did this to him.

121
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:54,012
I want you to find him because...

122
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,812
I don't think he'll stop
untill my father is dead.

123
00:10:57,092 --> 00:10:58,412
Soo Yung.

124
00:10:58,413 --> 00:10:59,932
I need to hear you say it.

125
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:03,732
Okay, I promise.

126
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,252
And so do I.

127
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,052
Thank you.

128
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:13,612
Soo Yung, your father was addressing
the court before he was shot.

129
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,612
2 weeks ago, my father
mailed me an envelope...

130
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:21,212
he said, if anything ever happend
to him, I should give it to you

131
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,172
Where is it?

132
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,412
I put it in my locker...

133
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:25,732
at the Kung Fu studio, where I teach,

134
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:30,572
It's at 8347 First Street... China Town.

135
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:44,732
Go home, Carter, this has
nothing to do with you,

136
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:47,252
I made Soo Yung a
promise the same as you.

137
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:49,452
This is a business of China,

138
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:51,372
Well for your information
I'm part Chinese now,

139
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:55,012
That's right Lee, for the last 3 year,
I studied at the Institute of the Budah...

140
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:58,013
Earning 2 black belts
in Wushu Martial arts

141
00:11:58,014 --> 00:11:59,014
And spending every afternoon at
the Hong Kong Massage Parlor...

142
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:01,852
I'm half Chinese, baby!

143
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:03,932
If you're half Chinese,
I'm half black...

144
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,092
I'm your brother, and I'm fly,
you're done with this, Snoopy?

145
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,332
That's dope, ain'it?

146
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:10,412
Sorry Lee, you can't be black!

147
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,572
There's a height requirement. I'm
still with you, no matter what,

148
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:13,772
Go home, Carter!

149
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:17,132
I can't leave you, Lee,
now you're my "Peng You"

150
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:18,852
I can't leave my brother!

151
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,892
All right, listen up!

152
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:41,897
I need everyone's attention!

153
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:44,992
I'm Detective Carter,
this is Inspector Lee

154
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:48,017
We need see Soo Yung's locker right now!

155
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:50,772
No one is allowed in the back,
without the master's permission,

156
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:53,892
Maybe you didn't hear me,
we need to see that locker

157
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:55,752
I'm sorry

158
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:57,052
Wait, Carter!

159
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:58,612
Lee, I got this!

160
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,092
Hey!

161
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:04,497
Kids listen, Knife's will solve nothing,

162
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:07,652
As the Chinese say, all great
battles are won without fighting,

163
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:08,992
Sorry!
- Ok?

164
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:10,212
I don't know him!

165
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:17,772
Look!

166
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,332
Let's try again from the top!

167
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:23,937
None of the Wushu formality,

168
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:25,932
You ain't gonna see it coming...
you ain't gonna see it coming!

169
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:27,812
Stop!

170
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,012
Run for your lives!

171
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:33,492
It's about time, I get some
respect around here!

172
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:38,012
Carter, wait for the master!

173
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:43,072
Whoa, damn!

174
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,832
Sorry, man, I thought
this was the bathroom, sorry!

175
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,072
Lee, I got a big problem, man!

176
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:53,073
This boy's on steroid's,
he's got a head like King Kong.

177
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:54,272
Oh no!

178
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,512
Carter? You're okay?

179
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,672
Lee, Lee...

180
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,672
Awww... my bunion.

181
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:20,672
Come on, man, let me go,
I love Chinese people.

182
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:22,912
Wait!

183
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:37,052
How you say surrender in Chinese?

184
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:45,053
Okay, I'm gonna slice you up
like a Giant California Roll

185
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:16,252
I'm sorry!

186
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:35,472
May I help you?

187
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:37,592
We'll be asking you questions, old man

188
00:15:37,652 --> 00:15:38,392
Who are you?

189
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:38,957
Yu!

190
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:39,912
Not me, you!

191
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:40,797
Yes, I'm Yu

192
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:42,552
Just answer the damn
question, who are you?

193
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:43,757
I've told you!

194
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:46,032
Are you deaf?
- No, Yu is blind,

195
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,289
I'm not blind, you're blind,

196
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:48,477
That's what I just say,

197
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,752
You just say what?
- I did not say what, I say Yu,

198
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:51,917
That why I ask you,

199
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,872
And you're not answering...
- Shut up!

200
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:54,917
You!
- Yes?

201
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:56,672
Not you, him! What's your name?

202
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,837
Mi
- Yes, you!

203
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:59,512
I am Mi
- He's Mi! And I'm Yu

204
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:03,012
And I'm gonna whoop your ass
old man, sick of playing this game...

205
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:06,292
you, me, and everybodys
ass around here, you...

206
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:08,857
Carter!

207
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:10,692
- Lee, no, no,
- Carter,

208
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:16,172
Teacher, My name is Inspector Lee.
We have a key to Soo Yung's locker,

209
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:20,812
Some men came here this morning,
they had guns. They emptied...

210
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,132
her locker, I could not stop them,

211
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,452
You must go to her at once,

212
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:25,097
Why?

213
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:29,252
They said, she would end up
like her father.

214
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:31,332
Let's go! Thank you.

215
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:35,412
I don't know what the hell you feeding him, but he's too damn big.
- Carter, let's go!

216
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:58,292
Where's everyone?

217
00:16:58,327 --> 00:16:59,812
Where's all the damn cops?

218
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:06,097
Lee?

219
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:06,897
Where's the security?

220
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:08,332
They were called away.

221
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:09,812
What's wrong?

222
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:11,772
Carter!

223
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:16,812
They're coming for him!

224
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,332
What do we do?

225
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:31,532
No!

226
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:35,932
No!

227
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,652
Don't move or I'll blow your ass' Jigsaw

228
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:42,372
Get back!

229
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:45,712
Who send you?

230
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,072
Oh!

231
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:51,352
Don't move!

232
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:57,312
Lee, throw me a gun!

233
00:17:57,472 --> 00:17:58,912
Throw me a gun!

234
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:02,192
Damn, Lee!

235
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:29,992
Lee, I thought you watched my back!

236
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:47,472
Soo Yung, one more!

237
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:58,072
Lee, I'm in trouble, need assistance!

238
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:02,232
- Empty!
- What?

239
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:13,812
You see, I always guard your back,

240
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,552
Why the hell you give me
an empty gun?

241
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,992
I didn't know,

242
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:19,712
You almost got me killed, Lee!

243
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:24,472
Who send you?

244
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:29,072
What the hell is that?

245
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:30,097
I think he's speaking French,

246
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:32,612
French? What kind of Chinese speaks French?
Tell me something and dont play around,

247
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,892
Ok, I tell him, I don't speak French!

248
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:36,052
No!

249
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,053
No! Stop humiliating yourself!

250
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:50,452
Find someone here, who
speaks French, please,

251
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:53,332
Speak English!

252
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:57,772
This is Sister Agnes,
from the chapel upstair...

253
00:19:57,807 --> 00:20:00,252
she speaks fluent French, and she's
pleased to intrubite for you,

254
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,252
Sister, we appreciate
you're doing this

255
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:03,217
My Pleasure!

256
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:06,092
Sister Agnes, please ask who send him!

257
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:14,257
He said, you both making a big mistake

258
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,332
That one day, you'll beg him
for mercy, he also said...

259
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:19,252
What?

260
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,932
Please, Sister, we have to know!

261
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:22,592
There's lifes at stake.

262
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:24,772
Well, he used the "N" word

263
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,492
What, the "N" word?

264
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:28,892
- You tell this little mother...
- Carter!

265
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:31,532
She's a nun,

266
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:36,972
Sister, you tell this piece of "S" word,
that I will personally "F" word him up!

267
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,457
Did he say Nigger?

268
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:50,772
He use the "N" word again, but this
time he mention your grandmother

269
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:53,212
You tell him, that his mama is a "H",

270
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:54,497
Carter!

271
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:56,297
I believe Whore is spelled with a "W"

272
00:20:56,332 --> 00:21:00,412
Right, "W", and his sister's a "W",
and his grandmama is 2 big "W's"...

273
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,489
who makes 2 double that's got no "T's"!

274
00:21:02,524 --> 00:21:04,532
You tell I'm said that!

275
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:16,677
Did he say it again?

276
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:22,712
No, this time, he called this Gentleman
a word that means cat and another word

277
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:24,312
that rhymes with matt,

278
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:25,632
What?

279
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:28,472
Would you tell him, his an "AW"

280
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:31,172
Lee, hole is spelled with "H",

281
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,899
I have a dictionary upstair.

282
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:34,592
Just call him an asshole!

283
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:41,652
He said you both are marked for
death, like Han the girl,

284
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:44,292
Sister, turn your back, you
don't want to see this!

285
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:46,217
Who is Sha Xing, and how do we find him?

286
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:48,892
Tell me right now, or I'll cut
your beets off, and shove'm in your mouth

287
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:49,817
His beets?

288
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:51,052
His beets, Sister He's carreing
stinkin' beets!

289
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,097
Tell me something now!

290
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:56,932
Lee, give me the gun,
give me the gun, Lee!

291
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:02,612
Who is Sha Xing?

292
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,349
What he say Sister?

293
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:06,052
He said shoot me!

294
00:22:06,212 --> 00:22:08,892
Lee, there's no bullets in here.

295
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:09,657
Sorry!

296
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:11,852
I'm trying to kill somebody, man!

297
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:13,652
Damn!

298
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:14,737
Ok!

299
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:16,852
You better tell me somethin' right now,
or I'll send you right to heaven!

300
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:20,212
- Carter, stop!
- Tell me now, I ain't got nothin' to loose,

301
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:23,532
That's right sister, tell the lord he's
gonna have some company.

302
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:26,532
- Carter, stop!
- Tell me somethin'!

303
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,672
- Carter Enough!
- She's almost done, just give me father fire.

304
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:32,972
Just wait!

305
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:37,377
What did he say?

306
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:39,812
50 Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jon Piere,

307
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:42,852
Thank you!

308
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:45,892
Nice working with you, Sister!

309
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:47,732
Anytime, brother!

310
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:52,292
- 50 F.D.R.
- It's an address

311
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:55,193
It's a wild goose chase, every city in
America has a street named after Roosevelt,

312
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:57,332
- Who's Jon Piere?
- I don't know!

313
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:59,932
Soo Yung, we're getting you out of here!

314
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:00,577
Why?

315
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,812
Is not safe here!

316
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,229
I won't leave him!

317
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:04,612
We have no choice!

318
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:30,332
- Soo Yung?
- Mr. Reynard.

319
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,257
I'm glad your father is ok.

320
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,292
My people won't leave his side,
you have my word.

321
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:36,912
Thank you!

322
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,292
So, let's go!

323
00:23:38,692 --> 00:23:40,217
Where am I going?

324
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,092
We're getting out from this
Area, it's not safe for us!

325
00:23:43,127 --> 00:23:45,457
Just for a few days, Soo Yung, I promise

326
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,812
You're coming with me, and
my family to Paris!

327
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:52,052
Ok!

328
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:58,212
Wait!

329
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:01,932
You made me a promise!

330
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,292
Don't forget!

331
00:24:15,612 --> 00:24:17,372
My God!

332
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:20,412
We got an Assasin in custody that
only speaks French,

333
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:26,292
A limo blows up at the French Counsulat, and the next meeting of the world court is in Paris 2 days from now

334
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:28,292
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

335
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:29,057
Yeah!

336
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:33,652
We go to Fiji, we head out there for a year, we
change our names, get jobs and I'll call you Kiko!

337
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:36,932
We have to find Sha Xing,
before he finds us!

338
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,412
- We're going to Paris, ha?
- Yes, tonight!

339
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:53,012
Did you know, the average french
women is naked 34% at a time?

340
00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:55,732
We not going there for the women!

341
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:59,772
You have to forget about her,
and let me hook you up!

342
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:00,857
Hook me up?

343
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:02,852
After what you did to Isabella?

344
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:04,377
It was an accident!

345
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:06,332
Besides, you never even slept with her,

346
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,989
Thanks to you, but it was going to happen!

347
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:10,712
- But you had to ruin it,
- What did I do, that was so terrible?

348
00:25:10,732 --> 00:25:13,332
You shot my girlfriend, in the neck.

349
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,932
- There's nothing else to say,
- Now that she died...

350
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:18,232
So she had a cute li'll ass,
so she worked at air boco loco,

351
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:21,892
That was temporarily, as soon as she
complaint the secret service took her back.

352
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:25,732
You know what your problem is,
you need to relax, have some fun...

353
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,892
you have to much rice in your diet
and you're constipated,

354
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:28,932
I never should have brought you!

355
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:31,257
Listen, you need me, brother,

356
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:34,492
I don't need anyone, and
please don't call me brother

357
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,752
What's this?

358
00:25:35,787 --> 00:25:36,972
Underground they have in Paris

359
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,417
Forget it!

360
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:41,292
Check out the address!

361
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:43,732
50 Franklin D. Roosevelt,

362
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,012
Like I said, you need me.

363
00:25:46,252 --> 00:25:49,852
Excuse me, can we have one bag
Potato chips and some Exlax's.

364
00:25:57,352 --> 00:25:58,952
Where're the bag's at?

365
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:02,432
Excuse me, Gentleman.

366
00:26:03,592 --> 00:26:05,912
Would you please come with me?

367
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:07,117
Why?

368
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:09,472
Just need to ask you a few questions.

369
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:12,072
Ouch! Oh my god! Damn!

370
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,392
That's one of the worst
airports I've ever been to,

371
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:21,757
Now that I have your attention,

372
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:24,512
Why don't you tell me what you cops are
looking for here in Paris?

373
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:26,672
I told you, man, we're on vacation.

374
00:26:26,707 --> 00:26:28,157
Just taking in the sites.

375
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:32,992
Gentleman, this is my city, and
I must force away two stupid cops...

376
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:36,249
come here and get their heads
blown off by the Triads.

377
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:39,472
Now I can't force you to leave
but I can make a suggestion.

378
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:44,712
After all, I found this dirty
little gun inside your jacket.

379
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:48,352
Which means you could both
do 20 years in my jail.

380
00:26:48,512 --> 00:26:50,512
Do we understand each other?

381
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:52,912
Do we understand each other?

382
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:54,792
Excellent

383
00:26:54,832 --> 00:26:57,152
It was wonderful meeting you both.

384
00:26:58,272 --> 00:26:59,992
So we can go now?

385
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:01,912
This will just take a moment.

386
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:04,272
Welcome to Paris.

387
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:05,632
Oh shit

388
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:20,157
Where're you go?

389
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,712
50 Franklin D. Roosevelt

390
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:24,392
No, get out!

391
00:27:24,632 --> 00:27:25,317
What?

392
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,352
I don't drive his kind.

393
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:27,237
My kind?

394
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,032
Americans, I don't drive Americans.

395
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:29,957
But I'm Chinese.

396
00:27:29,992 --> 00:27:32,912
Yeah, but you're with him, and
they're the most violent people I know.

397
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:35,552
Always starting war,
always killing people.

398
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,757
Americans make me sick.

399
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,797
Look, man, we're not
in the mood for this.

400
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:41,552
Me and my partner just got
violated by a small Frenchman.

401
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:42,917
Wearing a very large ring.

402
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,112
You're a pathetic bunch of criminals

403
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:46,397
Always resorting to violence.

404
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:48,037
Always pushing around the little guy.

405
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:49,912
That is not true,
Americans are not violent.

406
00:27:49,947 --> 00:27:51,377
Our man in America is a joke.

407
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:53,297
You lost in Vietnam, you lost in Iraq

408
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:55,972
You can't even beat the
Europeans in basketball anymore.

409
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,849
The dream team is death.

410
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,657
I didn't hear you, man

411
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:01,857
Talking about the NBA,
I dare you, I double dare you,

412
00:28:01,892 --> 00:28:05,212
Even with you're skinny woman
like Halle Berry.

413
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:06,972
Oh, now you're going to far.

414
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:08,709
You want violence frenchman, realy?

415
00:28:08,744 --> 00:28:10,412
Do you want violence? Well, you got it

416
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:11,549
Put the gun down

417
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:12,652
Say I love America!

418
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:13,817
I love America,

419
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:14,737
Please don't kill me,

420
00:28:14,772 --> 00:28:16,132
Sing the national anthem,

421
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:20,372
Not that one, man, sing the American one,

422
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,532
I don't know it.

423
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,491
Wait right here George,

424
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:20,837
Hulala! Lee,

425
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:24,212
Carter, stay focust! We're
looking for Jon Pierre,

426
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:27,872
Let's split up, I'll take the woman.

427
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:53,372
Carter, James Carter

428
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:00,977
I know you probably dont
understand a word I'm saying...

429
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:04,732
but I gotta tell you, you're the most
beautiful woman I ever seen in my life.

430
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:08,252
And I like to strip you down and butter
you like a slice of wonder bread,

431
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:12,212
And shave your arm pits, and put
honey all over your naked body,

432
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:15,949
And for the next two or three weeks
I wouldn't get hungry there,

433
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:19,652
Well, James Carter, I happend
to speak 6 lauguages.

434
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:21,852
Is one of'm english?

435
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:24,252
Are you in or not?

436
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:29,777
Money plays,

437
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:32,212
Sir, it's a 1000 Euros minimum.

438
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,612
How much I'm short?

439
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:35,132
930 Euros,

440
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:39,052
It's okay, let him play.

441
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:40,732
Thank you,

442
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,692
I'm looking for Jon Pierre,

443
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,852
Maybe I can help you.

444
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:15,572
Do you know what I hate about cops?

445
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:18,777
Even when they're with a woman...

446
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:21,892
they can't stop thinking
about getting their man

447
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:23,732
Who is Sai Xing?

448
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:26,652
See what I mean.

449
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:30,912
Come upstairs, cop I'll
give you what you want.

450
00:31:35,631 --> 00:31:38,031
- Hit Me!
- Mister, this is Baccarat!

451
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:39,717
I know that,

452
00:31:39,752 --> 00:31:41,957
You think I don't know
baccarat when i play it?

453
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:44,552
When I was a kid, my friends and I used to
hang out at a place called magic Johnson...

454
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:47,152
and we played baccarat all night long.

455
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:49,832
Now hit me.

456
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:57,292
Three kings... read'm and weep,

457
00:32:01,272 --> 00:32:05,232
Three kings is a zero, you have the
worst possible hand, you lose

458
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:06,592
What?

459
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:13,592
Ahh... Madam has a seven, she wins
100,000 Euros, Bravo...

460
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,192
Mr. Carter, it's a pleasure,
you brought me luck,

461
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,752
I'm not here for some game,

462
00:32:22,632 --> 00:32:24,072
Excuse me,

463
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:34,932
Way to go Lee!
Today my boy becomes a man.

464
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:38,852
Why are you helping me?

465
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:40,952
Maybe I'm helping myself,

466
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:43,072
How do I find Jon Piere?

467
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:45,192
I see you like to get right to it,

468
00:32:45,352 --> 00:32:47,712
Do you know Shi Xing?

469
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:50,752
Would you like to know a secret, cop?

470
00:32:50,787 --> 00:32:52,512
Yes, please.

471
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:56,112
Someone's gonna die here tonight

472
00:33:01,392 --> 00:33:02,712
And it's you!

473
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,292
Come on buster, you don't hide

474
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,292
Do it, Lee,

475
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,632
Tear that ass up!

476
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,633
- You are a super freak!
- Carter!

477
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:25,357
Sorry!

478
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:26,952
- You got a boy friend?
- Carter!

479
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:30,432
Start that truck!

480
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:31,892
Go on!

481
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:33,112
Drive, fast!

482
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:55,492
Carter, look!

483
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,412
George, we need you to go faster, man.

484
00:34:58,447 --> 00:34:59,617
No, forget it,

485
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:02,012
You want to kill me
then go ahead, kill me,

486
00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:04,852
Drive faster!

487
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:08,897
Please, I'm scared

488
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:10,977
- George, you watch American movies?
- Yeah

489
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:14,092
Okay, man, alright,
listen, you're a superspy,

490
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:15,772
A superspy!

491
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:19,792
- Now drive this can, come on.
- Okay.

492
00:35:21,512 --> 00:35:23,512
I'm a superspy.

493
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:36,592
Oh, George, go!

494
00:35:40,912 --> 00:35:43,912
George, when I tell you to,
hit the breaks!

495
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:47,313
NOW!

496
00:35:53,272 --> 00:35:54,672
Oh my god! Lee!

497
00:35:59,072 --> 00:36:00,752
Back up!

498
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,552
Way to go, George!

499
00:36:17,352 --> 00:36:18,872
It's okay.

500
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:35,932
I got this one!

501
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:41,172
Oh my leg!

502
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:45,012
Lee, help!

503
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:58,012
Hold him down!

504
00:37:06,412 --> 00:37:07,412
Lee!

505
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:17,612
This is not my fight!
This is not...

506
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:24,612
Lee, my... my whole
life flashed in front of me.

507
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,492
In 3 years i've been married to
this American Chinese woman,

508
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:29,332
we had 3 kids, they just looked like you.
only they're adopted...

509
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:30,792
- Carter!
- What?

510
00:37:30,927 --> 00:37:33,452
- Put your hands up,
- What're talking about!

511
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:35,332
Whou!

512
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:58,192
Some people say the modern wall was
invented when the French built these sewers,

513
00:37:58,227 --> 00:38:01,152
10 million gallons pumped
through every hour,

514
00:38:01,352 --> 00:38:03,672
A marvel that no one ever sees,

515
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:06,432
Welcome to Paris, Lee.

516
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,037
Lee, you know this guy?

517
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:10,512
Go on, Lee, tell him who I am...

518
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:11,912
Don't be shy...

519
00:38:12,232 --> 00:38:14,392
Introduce him to your Xiong Di,

520
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:16,557
Xiong Di? Your brother!

521
00:38:16,592 --> 00:38:18,077
He doesn't talk about me much...

522
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,472
In fact, he's spend his
whole life trying to forget me,

523
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,029
How would it look if Hong Kong's
great Inspector Lee...

524
00:38:24,064 --> 00:38:26,552
had a brother on the
wrong side of the law?

525
00:38:26,832 --> 00:38:29,077
You're not my brother anymore,

526
00:38:29,112 --> 00:38:30,872
Are you forgetting about Chenzhou?

527
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:31,617
Yes, i forgot,

528
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:34,617
You spared my life in Los Angeles,

529
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:38,632
You could have shot me in that
alley. But you didn't pull the trigger.

530
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,797
because you can't escape your past.

531
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:43,752
I didn't kill you because
I'm not an assasin.

532
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:46,312
Let me repay the favor, Lee,

533
00:38:46,712 --> 00:38:48,797
I allow you to live...

534
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,397
if you promise to leave Paris tonight.

535
00:38:50,432 --> 00:38:52,632
You got yourself a deal...
thank you for showing us the sewer,

536
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:55,792
...listen, that's a bad ass suit,
let's get the hell out of here

537
00:38:55,827 --> 00:38:58,309
What about Han and his daughter?

538
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:00,792
There's nothing i can do for them.

539
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:02,397
I have no choice.

540
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:03,837
Then I have no choice.

541
00:39:03,872 --> 00:39:06,712
I guess he's staying, who wants
to take me to the airport?

542
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:11,232
We're always be brothers, Lee,

543
00:39:11,512 --> 00:39:13,992
In this life and the next.

544
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,992
Tell me, Kenji, who is Shi Xing?

545
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:23,112
Some secrets are worth dying for,

546
00:39:25,272 --> 00:39:27,152
Hold it, alright, okay,

547
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,672
Lee, what the hell is going on?

548
00:39:47,392 --> 00:39:48,552
Shit, man, it's locked!

549
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:49,677
Over here,

550
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:51,072
We've got to jump!

551
00:39:53,512 --> 00:39:55,552
Oh, it's a sewer, man, hell no Lee

552
00:39:55,752 --> 00:39:57,312
- No choice
- I rather die

553
00:39:57,347 --> 00:39:58,512
Come on!

554
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:11,272
I'm gonna kill you, Lee!

555
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:22,432
Welcome to the Patacy Inn,
how may I help you?

556
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:27,092
- Its great to see you again, its been to long.
- Yes, far to long Sir.

557
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:30,792
Listen, I need a big suite, two beds,
two showers...

558
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:34,192
a massage therepist, some new clothes,
and a case of Old Spice.

559
00:40:35,712 --> 00:40:39,232
That's all your fault, how come
you didn't tell me about Kenji?

560
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:42,712
It was none of your business.

561
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:46,557
In case you missed it man,
he was trying to kill me.

562
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:50,432
I'm covered in shit, and some french cops
whooped my ass with yellow pages, man.

563
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:52,317
So don't tell me it's none of my business.

564
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:55,392
You're lucky,we're not in Hong Kong,
phonebook is twice as big.

565
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:57,672
Why didn't you tell me
you had a brother man?

566
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:05,592
Oh, hell, no... lady, your
damn dog just pissed on me.

567
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:08,432
Good girl.

568
00:41:11,232 --> 00:41:15,192
Do you know what I think?
I think you feel sorry for this guy.

569
00:41:16,552 --> 00:41:18,872
Maybe Kenji didn't get away in LA

570
00:41:20,392 --> 00:41:22,472
Maybe you let him go.

571
00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:27,272
The Aqusa killed his family in Tokyo.
He was send to China when he was seven.

572
00:41:27,307 --> 00:41:32,032
He was put in Ching Zhou at the orphanage
where I was.

573
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:33,677
We kept each other alive.

574
00:41:33,712 --> 00:41:36,672
You protected each other,
and you still protect him.

575
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:40,752
I called him Xiong Di,
he was like my brother.

576
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:45,512
- And then, I left him.
- You was adopted, what choice did you have?

577
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:50,712
He headed out on the streets.
You could never understand.

578
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:52,997
I understand man, I got a brother,

579
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:55,912
My little Brother Perry, we used to be
best friends, now we don't speak.

580
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,792
He thinks I took the cops out by
his chicken fights in his garage?

581
00:41:58,827 --> 00:42:01,077
Do you believe that? My own
brother thinks I'm a snitch.

582
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:04,472
Just because my chicken lost, in the semi finals, I'm even a kid...
- Carter!

583
00:42:04,507 --> 00:42:06,957
I had it fixed, we can find the
chicken and still make it's way.

584
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:10,632
And it still went the distance, it had
a lot'a heart, and it was delicious.

585
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:13,997
It's best if I do this on my own.
This fight is personal.

586
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,112
Let me help you, man, I'm telling you, what
ever the kid's telling you, it ain't true,

587
00:42:17,147 --> 00:42:19,952
- He ain't your brother.
- And you're not my brother.

588
00:42:23,492 --> 00:42:27,332
Fine, I'm not your brother.

589
00:43:18,052 --> 00:43:25,012
Yes... I would like to order some fried chicken
please, oh, and some sweet potato pie, Merci.

590
00:43:26,252 --> 00:43:29,252
Enjoy your Mushu Sir.
- Thank you. - Good bye.

591
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:26,812
- Oh...
- Hello Inspector.

592
00:44:27,092 --> 00:44:31,372
- Hi, Mr. Raynard.
- They want to kill me, may I come in?

593
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:34,492
A dozend agent from the French secret
police have already been murdered...

594
00:44:34,494 --> 00:44:38,972
only this last month, we're at war with
the Triads, right here in my own city.

595
00:44:39,172 --> 00:44:40,577
Who is Shi Xing?

596
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:44,851
Ah, Sha Xing, Sha Xing is not a person, it's a list.
- A list?

597
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:51,052
Yes, every five years, the Triad bosses
come togather for an election.

598
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:55,572
And during that ceremony, they'll
choose the man who will lead the Triads.

599
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:57,132
Dragon Heads.

600
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:57,892
Yes,

601
00:44:58,032 --> 00:45:03,577
13 Dragon Heads who control the largest criminal organization in the world. And the 13 names, are...

602
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:11,252
inscribe on the list known as Sha Xing, a secret that's
been handed down from generation to generation.

603
00:45:13,132 --> 00:45:15,732
If the names from that
list, will ever to get out.

604
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:18,732
The secret society wouldn't
be so secret anymore.

605
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:21,189
They would all be ending up in jail or dead.

606
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:23,577
And the list is some where in Paris?

607
00:45:23,612 --> 00:45:27,212
A young lady named Generieve,
made contact with Ambassador Han,

608
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:30,472
And we belief she know where it is.

609
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:35,177
I'm asking for your help, Inspector.

610
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:39,132
Finish what Ambassador Han started. Get to the
girl, before the Triads do, and you get (?).

611
00:46:21,372 --> 00:46:27,302
- I don't know such, who are you?
- Who am I? I'm Bubbles, your new costume designer.

612
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:32,252
- Has anyone seen Goldie Hayes?
- She's has her own dressing room.

613
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:39,012
Wait... Bubbles, do we look ok?

614
00:46:49,972 --> 00:46:55,472
No, no, no, these costumes are terrible.
Ladies please, we have work to do.

615
00:47:32,872 --> 00:47:37,232
1st, I would dress the Blonde's...

616
00:47:42,372 --> 00:47:46,232
and then the Brunnett's...

617
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:55,232
and finaly the highritz...

618
00:47:58,272 --> 00:48:01,232
the Lord has truely blessed you all...

619
00:48:02,332 --> 00:48:06,332
Would I mean this... trust me...

620
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:14,332
and some of you have what I like
to call... silver dollar potential.

621
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:38,252
- Lee, what're you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

622
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:41,052
- I found Generieve.
- So did I, they're trying to kill her.

623
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:43,292
- What?
- Look.

624
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:50,692
- Lee, you get the lights, I get the girl.
- Go.

625
00:49:58,892 --> 00:50:01,857
- Your life is in danger!
- What the hell is going on?

626
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:05,452
You step into that spot light, it's the
last step you ever gonna take,

627
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:09,312
- They're gonna kill you right now!
- Who are you?

628
00:50:13,572 --> 00:50:15,472
James Carter, L.A.P.D.

629
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:18,973
Sorry James, It's time for my solo

630
00:51:46,112 --> 00:51:47,992
Get your hands off of me!

631
00:52:08,732 --> 00:52:12,392
- Taxi! Taxi!
- Get in,

632
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:13,772
Go, go, go!

633
00:52:17,812 --> 00:52:21,012
I've been looking for you all
day, my friend, we need to talk,

634
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:22,972
Forget it George, we're not paying
for any damages

635
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:25,017
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't want you to pay...

636
00:52:25,052 --> 00:52:28,132
I want to ask, if I can drive for
you full time, no charge,

637
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:29,292
Why you want to drive for us?

638
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:31,017
Today was amazing,

639
00:52:31,052 --> 00:52:34,812
The guns, the shooting, now I understand
what it is to be an American,

640
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:37,692
Please, I'm begging you,
let me be your driver!

641
00:52:37,727 --> 00:52:40,057
Let me kill someone tonight!

642
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:44,132
- You never be American ok?
- I'll drink this shit all day if I have to

643
00:52:44,332 --> 00:52:45,537
Just give me a chance,

644
00:52:45,572 --> 00:52:47,772
Alright, fine, get us to the plaza fast

645
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:49,612
You got it, boss

646
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:51,052
Hold on!

647
00:52:59,692 --> 00:53:02,212
So you think, she stole the
Sha Xing list from the Triad?

648
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:03,849
Only one way to find out!

649
00:53:03,884 --> 00:53:05,888
You think what I'm thinking?

650
00:53:05,923 --> 00:53:07,857
We need her to talk! Get her relaxed!

651
00:53:07,892 --> 00:53:10,172
We can get some
wine from the mini bar

652
00:53:13,611 --> 00:53:16,611
Maybe we should put on a dirty movie,

653
00:53:16,612 --> 00:53:17,617
Lee!

654
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,912
Only 9.95!

655
00:53:18,992 --> 00:53:21,332
This is our chance to find Sha Xing!

656
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:22,857
I'm going in!

657
00:53:22,892 --> 00:53:24,257
What's wrong with you?

658
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:30,292
- Wait, let me go with you!
- Something's a man has do on his own,

659
00:53:36,072 --> 00:53:37,597
You ok?

660
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,552
Can't mister, figure out what I have done?

661
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:41,312
I'm as good as dead!

662
00:53:41,313 --> 00:53:45,313
You stole the list didn't you
you tryed to sell it to Han?

663
00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:48,572
You don't get it!

664
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:50,352
I'm one of them!

665
00:53:50,552 --> 00:53:52,912
And If I'm dead, you're dead!

666
00:53:59,912 --> 00:54:01,352
Hey!

667
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:05,592
We're safe, no one know
we're here, just relax!

668
00:54:06,832 --> 00:54:08,712
No one is safe,

669
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,552
I'm marked!

670
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:11,917
Trust me!

671
00:54:11,952 --> 00:54:13,412
Why should I trust you?

672
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:14,872
As the Chinese say...

673
00:54:17,752 --> 00:54:18,712
What does that mean?

674
00:54:19,472 --> 00:54:22,672
A donkeys lips will not fit on a horses mouth,

675
00:54:23,872 --> 00:54:26,352
I'm not sure I can relax,

676
00:54:27,112 --> 00:54:29,512
Well, I was, thinking!

677
00:54:29,872 --> 00:54:32,552
You have nice lips, that's all,

678
00:54:35,152 --> 00:54:38,032
You safed my life today,
thank you, Carter!

679
00:54:38,392 --> 00:54:40,712
Oh, please, call me james,

680
00:54:42,472 --> 00:54:45,112
No one safed me in a long time!

681
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:47,132
How can I repay you!

682
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:48,832
You have 20 Bucks?

683
00:54:51,312 --> 00:54:52,832
How about ten?

684
00:54:56,272 --> 00:54:57,197
What?

685
00:54:57,232 --> 00:54:59,352
I'm bad too - I'm a
bad girl - Haleluya

686
00:55:15,272 --> 00:55:18,072
Don't you want to?
My nipples are sensitive be careful.

687
00:55:19,912 --> 00:55:21,832
- I've never been with an American man before,
- Neither have I,

688
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:22,833
I feel so safe with you,

689
00:55:24,312 --> 00:55:25,672
Do you want me?

690
00:55:26,232 --> 00:55:29,437
- Once or twice and once in the shower,
- Oh yeah?

691
00:55:29,472 --> 00:55:32,792
I'm going to bathroom,
make myself more comfortable,

692
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:38,152
Don't move, I'll be right back!

693
00:55:41,112 --> 00:55:45,432
Hello, room service?
Get me a bottle of Honey and some RedBull,

694
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:14,437
Do you like it?

695
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:16,072
No wonderland is all soked and
all the way here to ride a bike...

696
00:56:17,352 --> 00:56:19,112
Thank you,

697
00:56:24,952 --> 00:56:27,512
Wait, baby, wait!

698
00:56:37,872 --> 00:56:39,632
Oh yeah!

699
00:56:44,432 --> 00:56:46,312
Freeze, don't move!

700
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:49,432
Damn!

701
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,032
- I'm sorry
- It's ok...

702
00:56:58,067 --> 00:56:59,032
I'm ok!

703
00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:06,237
So, we're even now, huh? Is that it?

704
00:57:06,272 --> 00:57:07,712
I shoot your girl You shoot my girl

705
00:57:08,032 --> 00:57:09,477
I tryed to save your life,

706
00:57:09,512 --> 00:57:13,252
Couldn't you wait 5 minutes, we started
makeing love, man, and you ruined it

707
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:15,932
They will be coming for us, we
have to get out of here, now!

708
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:17,297
You see that?

709
00:57:17,332 --> 00:57:19,092
We got to get out of here now, damn!

710
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:20,112
Lee, damn you!

711
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:21,812
Next time, I'll get my own damn room!

712
00:57:24,712 --> 00:57:26,332
They have a problem! Get them out!
George! These people are dangeres,

713
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:33,452
There is something you should know

714
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:36,012
I'm not what you think I am!

715
00:57:36,492 --> 00:57:38,772
Are you telling me, you're gay?

716
00:57:42,772 --> 00:57:45,812
I'm try to tell you, I'm American spy

717
00:57:47,052 --> 00:57:48,297
You're a spy?

718
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:51,252
Yeah, I'm working undercover with the
police we're about to break a big case!

719
00:57:51,332 --> 00:57:56,812
Shut your mouth, George, you're nothing more then
a cab driver, just like your father was a cab driver,

720
00:57:56,813 --> 00:57:57,813
What Kind of case could you crack,

721
00:57:58,732 --> 00:58:00,692
Can't talk about it!

722
00:58:01,932 --> 00:58:03,417
From this moment on!

723
00:58:03,452 --> 00:58:06,332
Don't ever ask me, about my business!

724
00:58:06,932 --> 00:58:08,292
Come with me, shmuck!

725
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:09,692
Now!

726
00:58:14,712 --> 00:58:16,037
We need to get out of the city

727
00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:18,192
We're not going anywhere,
untill you tell us exactly...

728
00:58:18,227 --> 00:58:20,312
what's going on? Did you steal
that list from the Triats?

729
00:58:20,512 --> 00:58:23,912
Generieve... we can not help you,
until you tell us the truth...

730
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:25,992
where is Sha Xing?

731
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,272
It's right here!

732
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:32,152
Holly mother Jesus! She's a Man!

733
00:58:32,392 --> 00:58:36,152
I went to second base, with a damn
Frenchmen, It's a crying game

734
00:58:37,032 --> 00:58:38,672
I broke my par!

735
00:58:38,872 --> 00:58:40,632
I'm not the man, it's just a wig,

736
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:42,552
You sure about that?

737
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,192
Lee, go on check out her hardware

738
00:58:44,432 --> 00:58:46,512
If she's got anything in her bag, bigger
then a 3 iron, I'm gonna beat his ass,

739
00:58:47,832 --> 00:58:50,472
I'm a women, James, a women who needs
a way out... you have to help me,

740
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:52,712
You have Sha Xing?

741
00:58:52,747 --> 00:58:53,992
No!

742
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:55,912
I'm Sha Xing!

743
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:06,792
In the ancient time, when
the Triads selected new leaders,

744
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:09,872
They would secretly tatoo the
names on to a women...

745
00:59:10,952 --> 00:59:16,112
A women, who can carry the list of
Sha Xing, to the 35 borders of China

746
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,672
When the journey ended, and
the new leader was found...

747
00:59:19,707 --> 00:59:22,552
the women would be beheaded,
and burried forever,

748
00:59:22,832 --> 00:59:25,032
No records, no witness...

749
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:26,957
What the hell kind of tradition is that?

750
00:59:26,992 --> 00:59:29,492
Have these guys never heard
of a goddamn fax machine?

751
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:31,992
Kenji told me do it, he
said it was a great honor.

752
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,912
I wanted to do it for him.

753
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:34,997
For the brotherhood.

754
00:59:35,032 --> 00:59:36,557
Then why did you send
the names to Hun?

755
00:59:36,592 --> 00:59:39,032
Because I thought the world
court could protect me.

756
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:40,469
But now I see.

757
00:59:40,504 --> 00:59:41,837
Nobody can.

758
00:59:41,872 --> 00:59:43,952
You're mixed up in some weird shit, lady.

759
00:59:43,987 --> 00:59:46,032
I mean, man, whatever the hell you are.

760
00:59:46,067 --> 00:59:47,197
I'm a woman.

761
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:49,112
And they will send an army to
kill me. To protect their way.

762
00:59:50,112 --> 00:59:52,352
You know what? We can't
fight no army, Lee.

763
00:59:52,387 --> 00:59:54,672
Who can protect me? I mean us.

764
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:57,592
I know a place.

765
01:00:05,632 --> 01:00:08,192
I won't be here when
you come out. I'm sorry.

766
01:00:08,227 --> 01:00:10,089
My wife says I can't be a spy.

767
01:00:10,124 --> 01:00:12,638
And I have to be home for dinner.

768
01:00:12,673 --> 01:00:15,152
Truth is I'm a cab driver. Nothing more.

769
01:00:15,352 --> 01:00:17,072
This is my destiny.

770
01:00:17,272 --> 01:00:19,732
I will never know what
it's like to be an American.

771
01:00:19,767 --> 01:00:22,192
Never know what it feels
like to kill for no reason.

772
01:00:22,392 --> 01:00:24,272
George, it's okay.

773
01:00:24,752 --> 01:00:25,872
Thank you.

774
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:30,172
- And good luck.
- Good luck.

775
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:40,572
Mr. Raynard.

776
01:00:41,992 --> 01:00:44,272
We have it.

777
01:00:45,472 --> 01:00:47,712
The Sha Xing list, it's incredible.

778
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:49,917
Some people said it was a myth.

779
01:00:49,952 --> 01:00:54,552
No, it's no myth, I've seen it, felt it,
kissed it, but I didn't french kiss it.

780
01:00:54,587 --> 01:00:56,352
You do understand how dangerous this is.

781
01:00:56,387 --> 01:00:57,952
We could always use some protection.

782
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,257
Can we go to the police?

783
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:01,852
The Triads control to many of them.

784
01:01:02,132 --> 01:01:04,052
We have to get you out of the country.

785
01:01:05,112 --> 01:01:06,477
Now my dear.

786
01:01:06,512 --> 01:01:08,672
Would you mind taking off that wig...

787
01:01:08,673 --> 01:01:10,517
and showing us Sha Xing.

788
01:01:10,552 --> 01:01:13,272
We never told him that she was the list.

789
01:01:17,712 --> 01:01:19,312
Look at that.

790
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:23,032
13 names and things, through
centuries of tradition.

791
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:26,392
The only real proof that
a secret world exists.

792
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:31,393
Shut her up

793
01:01:34,072 --> 01:01:35,592
Get their guns.

794
01:01:45,192 --> 01:01:47,512
I told you he was
bad, didn't I tell you?

795
01:01:48,832 --> 01:01:51,472
Well, I was thinking it,
the explosion at the embassy.

796
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:53,872
As head of the world criminal court,

797
01:01:54,192 --> 01:01:55,272
it would make sense
for me to be a target.

798
01:01:55,307 --> 01:01:56,797
Why did you come to my room?

799
01:01:56,832 --> 01:01:58,677
Geneviere was going to be killed.

800
01:01:58,712 --> 01:02:02,832
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

801
01:02:02,992 --> 01:02:05,752
Now, it will end another way.

802
01:02:06,712 --> 01:02:08,397
It's over, Reynard.

803
01:02:08,432 --> 01:02:10,672
You know what it's like
to be an old man in prison?

804
01:02:10,707 --> 01:02:12,117
They call you pops.

805
01:02:12,152 --> 01:02:13,972
They make you work in the library.

806
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:15,792
Your best friend, s'gonna be a mouse.

807
01:02:18,312 --> 01:02:20,512
I'm not going to prison.

808
01:02:20,872 --> 01:02:23,192
You have a phone call, Inspector.

809
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:30,392
Hello, brother.

810
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:32,792
I'd like to make a trade.

811
01:02:33,152 --> 01:02:36,592
Some friends of mine came across
something in the Los Angeles.

812
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,392
Something very valuable.

813
01:02:40,432 --> 01:02:41,592
Lee.

814
01:02:41,752 --> 01:02:43,592
Help me please.

815
01:02:46,272 --> 01:02:48,112
Do we understand each other?

816
01:02:48,147 --> 01:02:49,152
What do you want?

817
01:02:49,187 --> 01:02:50,512
Sha Xing.

818
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:53,712
You and Geneviere will
meet me alone tonight.

819
01:02:53,952 --> 01:02:56,392
If I see you with any other cops...

820
01:02:56,632 --> 01:02:58,152
the girl dies.

821
01:02:58,672 --> 01:02:59,832
Where?

822
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:02,272
Jules Vaugh Restaurant.

823
01:03:02,432 --> 01:03:03,952
Midnight.

824
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:06,232
Don't be late.

825
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:40,352
He brought the girl.
Send the elevator down.

826
01:04:11,752 --> 01:04:14,112
Welcome to the party, Lee.

827
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:18,012
Tonight we celebrate
the return of Sha Xing...

828
01:04:18,047 --> 01:04:20,212
and the return of my brother.

829
01:04:21,012 --> 01:04:22,812
Where is Soo Yung.

830
01:04:38,532 --> 01:04:40,417
This sword has a past.

831
01:04:40,452 --> 01:04:44,132
Unlike our world, it has
seen much pain, much blood.

832
01:04:47,372 --> 01:04:51,212
Hundreds of years ago, the
Triads would kill their enemies...

833
01:04:51,247 --> 01:04:53,332
with 100 cuts to the body.

834
01:04:53,652 --> 01:04:56,932
They would be very careful
to avoid any major arteries...

835
01:04:57,212 --> 01:05:00,732
so that the victim would stay
alive for as long as possible.

836
01:05:01,572 --> 01:05:05,332
You have just experience
to your first cut.

837
01:05:06,172 --> 01:05:08,612
If anything happens to Soo Yung...

838
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,692
You can never kill me, Lee.

839
01:05:11,932 --> 01:05:13,577
We both know that.

840
01:05:13,612 --> 01:05:14,977
You know nothing about me.

841
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:18,892
I know you have no wife.
No children. No family.

842
01:05:19,732 --> 01:05:22,612
Your life ended when you
were a kid back in Chenjo.

843
01:05:28,212 --> 01:05:31,132
You have nothing... just like me.

844
01:05:32,252 --> 01:05:34,132
I wouldn't say nothing.

845
01:05:38,252 --> 01:05:40,132
He has me.

846
01:05:40,692 --> 01:05:43,012
His brother from another mother.

847
01:05:48,472 --> 01:05:50,092
Where is she?

848
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:51,712
Enjoy the view.

849
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:56,672
Soo Yung.

850
01:05:57,032 --> 01:05:58,392
Help me.

851
01:06:03,272 --> 01:06:04,437
Let her go.

852
01:06:04,472 --> 01:06:06,272
What the hell is wrong with you?

853
01:06:06,307 --> 01:06:07,912
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

854
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:09,672
Get her in here,

855
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,717
Carter, drop the gun,

856
01:06:11,752 --> 01:06:14,752
Get off that damn brother, or I'll
shoot you and the damn temptations

857
01:06:14,952 --> 01:06:16,152
Right now!

858
01:06:22,432 --> 01:06:24,792
- Do it!
- Put her down, I'm serious

859
01:06:26,712 --> 01:06:28,312
I'm not playing, you ain't my damn brother

860
01:06:30,672 --> 01:06:33,152
Kenji - Drop
the gun. - No!

861
01:06:33,672 --> 01:06:35,352
Drop it, Carter!

862
01:06:35,832 --> 01:06:37,192
Shit

863
01:06:41,193 --> 01:06:45,193
Tonight I lose a brother.

864
01:06:52,032 --> 01:06:53,832
Get'm, man!

865
01:06:55,352 --> 01:06:57,392
I'm gonna kick your ass, Kenji,

866
01:07:08,472 --> 01:07:11,132
Come on, kill him already!

867
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:21,232
He might be your brother,
but turned out to be your sister,

868
01:07:50,912 --> 01:07:52,672
Give me your hand,

869
01:08:07,392 --> 01:08:09,392
Lee... Lee!

870
01:08:09,393 --> 01:08:10,792
Jesus!

871
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:13,472
Hold on, I'm coming!

872
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,572
Lee!

873
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:08,812
Enough, Kenji!

874
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:46,772
Everybody comes for kungfu fighting.

875
01:10:48,972 --> 01:10:50,772
Soo Yung?

876
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:06,772
What're you waiting for? Do it!

877
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:23,132
- Let go! We're both gonna die
- No, I can save you

878
01:11:33,052 --> 01:11:35,452
- Good bye, Lee
- No, Kenji

879
01:11:39,552 --> 01:11:41,432
Nooo...!

880
01:12:10,312 --> 01:12:12,152
I'm coming Soo Yung!

881
01:12:16,752 --> 01:12:18,312
My God,

882
01:12:27,752 --> 01:12:28,997
Stay cool lady!

883
01:12:29,032 --> 01:12:31,112
It doesn't have to end this way,

884
01:12:31,592 --> 01:12:33,632
Don't do it... don't do it lady,

885
01:12:34,232 --> 01:12:35,952
Don't you do it

886
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:38,872
Think about what you're doing?

887
01:12:41,332 --> 01:12:43,152
Hey... Hey!

888
01:12:43,832 --> 01:12:46,152
Would you like to know a secret?

889
01:12:46,392 --> 01:12:47,512
No...

890
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,432
No!

891
01:13:29,512 --> 01:13:31,912
- Lee, So Yung is up here,
- Soo Yung,

892
01:13:34,312 --> 01:13:35,632
I'm ok.

893
01:13:38,232 --> 01:13:39,352
Shit!

894
01:14:36,712 --> 01:14:38,072
Yeah!

895
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:54,072
Lee, Reel me in,

896
01:14:54,312 --> 01:14:56,372
Black people don't fly,

897
01:14:57,012 --> 01:14:58,372
Pull... Pull it,

898
01:15:01,112 --> 01:15:03,292
Lee! Get me out of here,

899
01:15:12,512 --> 01:15:15,292
Thank you, Lee,

900
01:15:20,712 --> 01:15:22,392
God...

901
01:15:41,592 --> 01:15:43,112
Lee I'll kill you, when we get down...

902
01:15:49,992 --> 01:15:51,552
Hang on!

903
01:16:02,672 --> 01:16:04,032
I'm drowning

904
01:16:05,392 --> 01:16:07,232
Hang on! Lee!

905
01:16:11,392 --> 01:16:15,232
Carter! - What?
- I'm not constepated anymore,

906
01:16:23,392 --> 01:16:25,232
Put your hand ups!

907
01:16:25,392 --> 01:16:28,252
Genvieve!... Hey man you're the head of
the world court,

908
01:16:28,253 --> 01:16:31,297
What you gonna do shoot us
down like animals?

909
01:16:31,298 --> 01:16:34,872
We're police officer
- Yes, and you two, just killed this girl

910
01:16:34,873 --> 01:16:37,092
Blew her brains out,

911
01:16:39,312 --> 01:16:41,332
Carter!
- Don't do it,

912
01:17:04,612 --> 01:17:11,392
Put the gun down,
- I follow'd you, Case Closed,

913
01:17:17,932 --> 01:17:20,292
Good job man, come on!

914
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:33,397
Hey man, you touch me again
you gonna be dead in the movie,

915
01:17:33,432 --> 01:17:37,532
Congratulation, it appears we finally
broke down the Traits,

916
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:40,252
We?
- You didn't do shit!

917
01:17:41,652 --> 01:17:45,312
The Americans and the French need to work
together in the spirit of brotherhood...

918
01:17:45,347 --> 01:17:46,912
together we can do anything,

919
01:17:46,992 --> 01:17:48,852
Anything!

920
01:17:48,853 --> 01:17:51,172
Yeah he's right, Lee,
together we can do anything,

921
01:17:51,207 --> 01:17:53,372
You go this way and I go that way,

922
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:26,532
That right Lee, last 3 years I
study the Ancient teaching of Boody...

923
01:18:29,412 --> 01:18:30,772
Cheese!

924
01:18:35,132 --> 01:18:36,892
What? Oh Freeze!

925
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:40,732
As soon as she could
bring, the seafood secret

926
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:44,570
As soon as she could
bring, the seafood secret

927
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:51,130
The seafood secret

928
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:56,610
I know seafood, I know secret, secret
see but when everything together
