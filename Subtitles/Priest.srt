1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,300
I don't know, feels like a grave. 

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,700
Their queen is here.

4
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,200
And we have our orders.

5
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,700
It's a trap.

6
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,207
Hold on!

7
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,130
No!

8
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,200
This is what is known.

9
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,800
There has always been man,

10
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,900
and there have always been vampires.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Since the beginning, the two
have been locked in conflict.

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,500
The vampire's were quicker, stronger,

13
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,700
but man had the sun.

14
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,000
It was not enough.

15
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,100
And so it went like
this over many years.

16
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,300
The two races destroying
not only each other,

17
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,700
but the world itself.

18
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,900
Facing extinction, mankind
withdrew behind walled cities

19
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,900
under the protection of the Church.

20
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:16,500
And then the ultimate weapon
was found, the priests.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Warriors with extraordinary powers, trained
by the Church in the art of vampire combat.

22
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,600
They alone turned the tide to man.

23
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,300
The remaining vampires were
placed on reservations.

24
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,800
And fearing the power of
the weapon they created...

25
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,100
the ruling clergy ordered
the priests disbanded.

26
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:53,700
The former warriors to be integrated back
into a society that no longer needed them.

27
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,900
And as the years passed,
the few surviving priests

28
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,900
faded into obscurity...

29
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:08,200
like the vampire menace before them.

30
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,400
Residual radiation is still spotty,

31
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,600
but the soil contamination
is close to zero.

32
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,600
With a little luck, we can
finally start planting.

33
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm proud of you, Owen.

34
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Great, stew again.

35
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,300
- Atoning for your sins?
- No, why?

36
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Wearing the nicest dress, where else
would you have been all day, but church?

37
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,300
I was in town.

38
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,600
I figure someone here needs
a life outside this outpost.

39
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I thought I said I didn't want you
to spending so much time out there.

40
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,100
- I'm old enough to go where I want.
- You're 18. That's not old enough, not out here.

41
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,600
I know it's hard, but we
all have to make sacrifices.

42
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
Sacrifices?!

43
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,600
You mean living out
here like a prisoner?!

44
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
- Lucy?
- No friends, no fun?!

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,100
Just that someday you might be able to
grow something in these godforsaken lands?

46
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,900
Enough!

47
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,900
Bow your heads and say grace.

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Dear Lord, we thank you for
what we are about to receive...

49
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,700
- Daddy?
- Shush!

50
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,100
- Owen?
- Tear down below!

51
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,900
What's going on?!

52
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,500
Hurry child!

53
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,900
Hurry!

54
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,300
- Mama.
- Whatever you hear... don't scream.

55
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,100
Oh, my god!

56
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,700
Get behind me!

57
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,100
Shannon!

58
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,600
God protects you, the
Church protects you.

59
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,700
The city protects you.

60
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,800
Absolution is the only way.

61
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Absolution is the only way.

62
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:36,600
Remember, to against the
Church, means to go against God.

63
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,000
Confession room 5 is free.

64
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,400
Move forward.

65
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,800
Initiate confessional sequence.

66
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,500
Please speak at the tone.

67
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.

68
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,600
- Yes, my son?
- I had the dream again

69
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,100
- about the war.
- Tell me more.

70
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,800
We were in the hives, like always.

71
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,800
He fell, and I wasn't strong enough.

72
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,300
Tell me more.

73
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,800
I have questions, doubts.

74
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,100
The Devil comes in many shapes.

75
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,900
The best way to combat him, is
through personnel sacrifice...

76
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,700
and a long day's labor.

77
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,800
Yes, Father.

78
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,900
Now say three Hail Mary's
and four Our Father's.

79
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:08,400
And remember, to go against the
Church, is to go against God.

80
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,300
- Don't point.
- Mom, what's on that man's face?

81
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,800
It's a tattoo.

82
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,300
Did it hurt?

83
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:35,000
- Why can't I talk to him?
- You don't talk to priests.

84
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,500
- Who are you?
- Name's Hicks, on the Sheriff from Augustine.

85
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
- What do you want?
- There was a vamp attack.

86
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,400
They took Lucy. Your brother, he's
hurt bad. He told me where to find you.

87
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,600
- And Shannon?
- No.

88
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,300
Lucy talked about you. Said
you were a hero during the war.

89
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,300
Said that when it came to killing
vampires, you were the best.

90
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,400
I'm going after her,
I'm gonna get her back.

91
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,300
Just thought I should let you know
in case you wanted to come along.

92
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Figure I could use someone
like you by my side.

93
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,900
Okay.

94
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,800
Thank you for meeting me in
such short notice, Monsignors.

95
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Monsignor Chamberlain has
informed us of the situation.

96
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,100
- Your family is in our prayers.
- Thank you.

97
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,500
I come before you because I
need my authority reinstated.

98
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,300
On what grounds?

99
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,400
- This was a vampire attack.
- Vampires?

100
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,300
Nonsense, we've had no reports of
any escapes from the reservations.

101
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,400
This is obviously the work
of wasteland bandits.

102
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,000
- Monsignor, the boy was clear.
- "The boy" was mistaken.

103
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,400
There is no vampire menace, the wastelands
are a haven for the lawless and the immoral.

104
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,400
To send a priest out there after such a
lot would be both ridiculous and futile.

105
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,700
This is best left to
the local authority.

106
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,000
Monsignor Orelas, this man has been
of great service to the Church.

107
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,300
If it weren't for the priest we
would have been overrun by the...

108
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,600
We are well aware of his
accomplishments, Monsignor Chamberlain.

109
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you, you may sit.

110
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,300
I am begging you.

111
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,600
- Allow me to find her.
- You must understand something priest.

112
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,000
The sanctity of these walls is absolute.

113
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,200
And the citizens from the cities have complete
faith in the Church's ability to keep them safe.

114
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,500
- You will not shake that faith.
- What good is that faith, when it's a lie?

115
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,900
Questioning the authority of the
clergy is absolutely forbidden.

116
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,900
If you take any action
to leave the cities...

117
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,800
it will be seem as an act of
aggression against the Church.

118
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,700
You will be stripped from the order and
excommunicated immediately. Do I make myself clear?

119
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:09,200
I said, do I make myself clear, father?

120
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,900
Yes, Monsignor.

121
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:23,800
Try to remember your vow. To go against
the Church, is to go against God.

122
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,500
Come on now. Don't be shy.

123
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,300
Give us a kiss.

124
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
That's no way to treat a friend.

125
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Please, let me go...

126
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,000
You're in here for your own protection.

127
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,600
If I let you out, you'll be
torn apart, piece by piece.

128
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,200
My uncle's a priest,
he'll come after me.

129
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,600
Really?

130
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,000
- What makes you so sure?
- He'll come after me.

131
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,200
He'll come after you!

132
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,400
Well that's something I'm
absolutely counting on.

133
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,500
The judgment is final. I'm sorry.

134
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,000
I sacrificed everything to serve them.

135
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,800
- And now they won't listen to me.
- The war is long over.

136
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,100
You and the other
priests  did your jobs.

137
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,600
It's not over, not for me.

138
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,000
You can't break your
covenant to hunt down...

139
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,600
a small group of scavengers,
it would be sacrilege.

140
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,700
I have to.

141
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,600
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Move!

142
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,900
If you go out there right now,
you risk stirring things up again.

143
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,100
You have to look at the bigger
picture, it's for the greater good.

144
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,000
- Is this the world I fought for?
- No.

145
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,300
But it's the only world we have left.

146
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,700
I'm begging you, don't
do anything foolish.

147
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,200
Remember your vow. To go against
the Church, is to go against God.

148
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,500
Then I go against God.

149
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,900
God help us.

150
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,300
Dear Father, forgive me.

151
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,800
It was never my
intention to offend you.

152
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,900
I would like to firmly resolve
with the help of your grace...

153
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,700
to sin no more, and to avoid
the near occasions of sin.

154
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,100
But I can't.

155
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,900
Looting's not such a good idea mister.

156
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,200
Well, I'll be damned.

157
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Vampires are a vicious lie!

158
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,600
I have seen a vampire
bite a man clean in half.

159
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,500
Salvation is right
here in my very hands.

160
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,700
Authenticated by the
clergy themselves...

161
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,900
- Purchase this holy water and...
- Excuse me in a minute.

162
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,700
Keep your loved ones safe tonight...

163
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,700
I'm tired of you comin' around here,
scaring people, selling your superstition.

164
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,800
The show is over, and
it's time for you to go.

165
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,000
Give me one good reason why I should.

166
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,800
That's one... two...

167
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,700
Alright. Alright, alright!

168
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,100
Goddamn son of a bitch!

169
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,700
You all listen up!

170
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,300
This stuff is good for nothin'...

171
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,900
but lining for that man's pockets
for your hard earned cash!

172
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,300
You don't know that. You're just a kid.
We gotta do somethin' to keep us safe.

173
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,700
Move out of the way!

174
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,300
I don't blame any of
you for being scared,

175
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:17,000
but the vampires are gone
and they're not coming back.

176
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,400
You have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't too common out here.

177
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
Is it true what they say about priests?

178
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,000
You wield the hand of God?

179
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,300
How is he?

180
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,500
He's awake.

181
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,800
Your clergy took away a boy...

182
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,400
and returned an old man.

183
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,900
After the war was over...

184
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,100
Shannon figured you'd come back.

185
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,400
I wanted to.

186
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Didn't seem right any more.

187
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,500
I couldn't save her.

188
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,700
I tried, but I've never had your gift.

189
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,900
You gave her a life I no longer could.

190
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,600
I will always be grateful
to you for that.

191
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:44,100
You know there ain't one day that went
by, where I wished she'd forget about you.

192
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,500
You find Lucy, you bring her home safe.

193
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,900
And you promise me something brother.

194
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,400
Kill 'em all.

195
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,300
Most people out there know that the clergy
thinks of us as a bunch of godless heathens.

196
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,500
And that's how we like it. It means that they
tend to keep their noses out of our business.

197
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,800
So you can imagine how surprised I was when
they contacted me asking if I'd seen you.

198
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,700
Saying that anyone going after Lucy
is to be arrested immediately.

199
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Said she's in God's hands now.

200
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,800
Problem is, we both now outside
a week Lucy will be dead...

201
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,900
or worse, infected.

202
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,500
So with all due respect to god...

203
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,600
You're wasting your time.

204
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,700
No, no! You're not cutting me out of
this! I'm the one that came and got you!

205
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,400
People in this town don't think
you can keep them safe here.

206
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,700
What makes you think you'll
do any good out there?

207
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,000
- You any good with a gun?
- Better than I am with a knife.

208
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,800
We leave at dawn.

209
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,000
What's with all the bullets anyway? I
thought priests didn't use firearms.

210
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,900
We don't.

211
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,600
They're for you.

212
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,800
You have been called to serve once more.

213
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,200
One of your own has
broken his sacred vow.

214
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,800
His actions are a threat
to the entire order.

215
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:16,400
You will find him and
bring him back to me.

216
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,000
Dead or alive.

217
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,100
Then I will teach transgressed your
ways and return them back to you.

218
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,300
Save me from blood guilt... and
god who saves me and my tongue...

219
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:44,500
will sing of your righteousness...
in my mouth declare your prays...

220
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,200
- What is it?
- Vampire tracks are random...

221
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,800
in sets of 2, 3 or 4 prints at a
time, but these are two by two.

222
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,500
Must have been one of the familiars.

223
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,400
Vampires don't bring familiars on
the hunt, they slow them down.

224
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,600
All this...

225
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,400
this was something else.

226
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,600
Tracks head north.

227
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:43,200
- There's a reservation up that way.
- Well, then. That's where we start.

228
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,000
Mangshane Reservation. Nothing
but red-outs and rejects.

229
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,500
They're a fallen tribe.

230
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:05,200
Either way, we don't have
much time to get in and out.

231
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,200
No guards.

232
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I thought familiars were illegal.

233
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,100
Nobody really enforces it,
as long as it's voluntary.

234
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,400
- Voluntary?
- Yeah, they come from the fringes.

235
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Drifters that want to get infected.

236
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,300
I mean, becomin' a vampire slave
ain't my idea of belongin',

237
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,000
but people get all sorts of strange ideas.
So long as they keep to themselves...

238
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,100
it makes no difference to me.

239
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,000
You're not welcome here, Priest.

240
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,800
These lands are protected.

241
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,200
No! I got this.

242
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,500
I'm looking for a local girl, kidnapped
about four nights ago by a vamp-pack.

243
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,500
- They came through this way.
- Nobody comes through Nightshade.

244
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,000
It's the way we like it. Nice...

245
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
and quiet.

246
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,900
Good, we're sure we
won't have any trouble.

247
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:39,000
They excrete it, use
it to build the hives.

248
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:05,800
I guess now we know what
happened to the guards.

249
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,300
No. No, no, you must not...

250
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,000
The Master will be angry...

251
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,900
Where's the girl?

252
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,900
I don't know what you're
talking about. Please! Please!

253
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,100
The Master doesn't feed humans anymore.

254
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,200
Yeah, tell that to the guards.

255
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,900
- Where is she?
- Please don't, don't...

256
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,300
Where is she?

257
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,700
Shit!

258
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,800
Priest! Priest!

259
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,600
Save your bullets.

260
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,600
Now, we can do this the easy way or...

261
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,900
God. I always preferred the hard way.

262
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,400
- Tell me where they took the girl.
- Haven't you done enough already, priest?

263
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,200
- Tell me!
- Look around you. Look what you've done to them.

264
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,900
They once ruled this land, they
were warriors, they were Gods.

265
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,700
- They were murderers.
- They were what nature made them to be.

266
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:13,500
- Just like you.
- You got 10 seconds to start talking.

267
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,700
Then 10 seconds is all I
need. You're too late, Priest.

268
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,000
It is their time now.

269
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:30,000
- Did you get your gun on?
- Why?

270
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,200
You're gonna need it.

271
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil..."

272
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,100
Your words mean nothing to them, Priest.

273
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,300
"...for thou art with me."

274
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,600
Focus!

275
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,700
- Should we go after them?
- No need, they'll die at first light.

276
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:24,200
No more masters, just you and me.

277
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,000
Tell me where they took the girl.

278
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,200
- West. They took her west.
- Why?

279
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,300
You have no idea what's coming, Priest.

280
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,800
The familiar said they
travelled west from here.

281
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,900
- Sola Mira.
- A hive?

282
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
One of the largest.

283
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,500
But I thought all of the hives
were liquidated after the war.

284
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,600
They were.

285
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,900
That's why we need to go look.

286
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,800
There are more than 50
crypts in this reservation.

287
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,200
but only 6 vampires left. The weak.

288
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:44,200
The left behind. We find the
missing, we find Lucy.

289
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,800
I may not have seen the war,

290
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,300
but I know the look a man
gets when he likes killing.

291
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,600
It comes easy to you.

292
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,700
It just comes.

293
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:08,300
Easy's got nothing to do with it.

294
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,300
Give me your gun.

295
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,200
- What?
- Give me your gun.

296
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Vampires don't move like humans.

297
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:30,100
Their body weight pulls them
in concentric patterns.

298
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,600
You need to anticipate their
trajectory to get a kill shot.

299
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,900
- Are you teaching me to shoot?
- I'm teaching you how to kill vampires.

300
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,400
There are always two points. A and B.

301
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,500
Know them both, you'll kill a vampire.

302
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:05,400
A man came aboard. Says
he has something for you.

303
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,200
You told me to come if I had any information.

304
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,600
But before I tell you,
and I hate to bring this up,

305
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,400
but there is this small little
matter of compensation.

306
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,100
Now, you've been really
good for business.

307
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,900
So I am more than willing
to cut you a deal.

308
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,700
I can smell the blood
running through you veins?

309
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,900
Smells like dinner.

310
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,400
Okay. Alright.

311
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,100
After you snatched the girl, a couple
of nights later, a priest showed up.

312
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,300
- Priest?
- And he was with this Sheriff,

313
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,700
real hard case. He run me out of town
before I could make a single sell.

314
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,100
- You've done well.
- Thank you.

315
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,500
There's your compensation.

316
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,300
Put him to work.

317
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,300
I used to ride out here a lot
when I was little.

318
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,200
Stare at all this stuff.

319
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,800
Wonder what it used to be.

320
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:26,100
After a while, it just
made my eyes ache.

321
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,700
Did Owen know about you and Lucy?

322
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,000
No, no.

323
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,500
She wanted to tell him, but...

324
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,200
Owen wasn't the easiest man to talk to.

325
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,900
Besides, he was so focused on his work
there wasn't much room for anything else.

326
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,600
Do you love her?

327
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,600
You know if she's infected...

328
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,200
I'll kill her.

329
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,600
You'll try...

330
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,900
but you won't be able to.

331
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:37,600
I wasn't there to protect her once,
I won't make that same mistake again.

332
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,400
- Feels like a grave.
- It's a trap.

333
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,800
This is a waste of time,
there's nothing here.

334
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:01,700
Stay here, if anything comes
up that isn't me, shoot it.

335
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,600
Great.

336
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:38,400
- What are you doing here?
- The Clergy sent me. Ordered me to bring you back.

337
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,100
They sent four of us to track
you. We split up at Nightshade.

338
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,900
I rode out here and hoped
they didn't have you.

339
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,700
The others went up to Jericho.

340
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,400
I didn't believe it when they
told me you broke your vow.

341
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,600
They left me no choice. Hicks!

342
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,100
What the hell is that thing?

343
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,100
- A hive guardian.
- Who the hell are you?!

344
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,400
It's too big to get down here. Which
is the only reason you're still alive.

345
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,700
Who the hell is that?

346
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,300
Are you ready?

347
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,300
Hey!

348
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,600
Not bad.

349
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,300
Point A, meet point fucking B.

350
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:15,000
The hive's been abandoned for years.
Why would something be protecting it?

351
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,700
Does the lawman know what
you'll do if she's infected?

352
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,200
He knows.

353
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:26,200
- He'll try to stop you.
- He won't be able to.

354
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,800
It's been hard all these years...

355
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,000
not seeing the others, not talking.

356
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,300
Sector 7 was the only
place I could find work.

357
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,500
Waste management.

358
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,000
No one would hire me.
"No applicable skills."

359
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,900
I heard that, too.

360
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,700
I didn't come here to bring you back.

361
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:57,300
I came here to warn you.

362
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,900
There are nights when I wake up...

363
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,700
I think I'm back on the red mines.

364
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:16,900
I'm sweating. My muscles are clenched
like, like I'm ready for something.

365
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,400
Nights like that, I
don't go back to sleep.

366
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,500
I have bad dreams.

367
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,500
Me, too.

368
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,300
There are other nights,
the good nights...

369
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:40,200
I dream about other things.

370
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:07,500
- Why doesn't it look like the rest of the hive?
- This sections new. They must have rebuilt it.

371
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,400
My God.

372
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,600
They bred a new army.

373
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,000
Where did they all go?

374
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,900
Only one way to find out.

375
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,300
Are priests allowed to have relations?

376
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,000
- We take a vow of celibacy.
- So, you mean you've never...

377
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,700
I was a young girl when
the Clergy found me.

378
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,800
What about him?

379
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,100
His talents developed later.

380
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:02,600
He was nearly you're age when
the Clergy came for him.

381
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,200
That made his sacrifice
greater than most.

382
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,800
The air is changing.

383
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,500
Well, there's your answer.

384
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,800
They dug right through
the mountain and...

385
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,600
made a hole big enough
to fit an army through.

386
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,900
What town is that?

387
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,800
It's Jericho.

388
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,200
Where'd you say the others went?

389
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,100
What the hell?

390
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,800
Hello?!

391
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,100
Hello!

392
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,600
Is anybody there?

393
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,000
Let's begin.

394
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,600
I don't see anything.

395
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,700
Brothers, you have a choice.

396
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:10,600
You can follow in my footsteps
or you can follow in his.

397
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,900
We're too late.

398
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:38,200
We separate. Go through each
building, and see what we find.

399
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,000
There's nobody left. Not a soul.

400
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,600
Too many mouths to feed.

401
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:41,100
Killing three priests? What kind of
vampire could do something like that?

402
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,800
Nothing we've ever seen before.

403
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,900
How could they take an entire town
over night, and vanish by sunrise?

404
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:56,600
There are no other hives
around here, no reservations.

405
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,200
- Where does this rail line go?
- It's an old mining line.

406
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,600
It starts in the Dunkirk
mine above Augustine.

407
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,100
- Jericho's the last stop before it reaches...
- The cities.

408
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,200
Heading back to the cities
would be suicide, right?

409
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,700
- The sun will kill them.
- There is no sun in the cities.

410
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,500
Not anymore.

411
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:28,300
Without us, they're defenseless.

412
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,100
- I'm responsible.
- No, this was systematic.

413
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,000
Whoever took Lucy knew
that you'd come for her...

414
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,000
and that we'd come for you.
They were drawing us out.

415
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,400
They must have been picking up
different factions along the way,

416
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,400
moving during the day
and feeding at night.

417
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,400
- It's going to be a massacre.
- It's going to be a war.

418
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,000
Train carrying an army of vampires?

419
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,100
What chance do we have
stopping something like that?

420
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,900
I'll overtake the train and blow the
rail-line. You two get aboard and find Lucy.

421
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,100
I'll start charging the bikes.
It's gonna take everything we have

422
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:09,200
to stop that train before
it reaches the cities.

423
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,700
You must be starving. You
haven't eaten in days.

424
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:24,200
Have you ever had a real roast duck?

425
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,200
It's very rare, very exotic.

426
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:38,000
- Of course not.
- Try it, you'll never have better.

427
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:45,500
- What do you want?
- I want the same things that you want.

428
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,200
I want to be free from a life
of suffering and sacrifice.

429
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,600
To no longer be told that
your every desire is a sin.

430
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:05,300
And after all, if you're not committing
sin, you're no longer having fun.

431
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,900
What are you?

432
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:20,000
The Church teaches us that the
eyes are the window to the soul...

433
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,400
and since the vampire evolved without
eyes, it is a soulless creature...

434
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,900
to be eradicated.

435
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,000
And I have seen the soul of the
vampire. And let me tell you...

436
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,200
it is far more pure
than that of any man.

437
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,900
Now you ask me what I am?

438
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,600
I am the bringer of the tide...

439
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,600
I am the wave to wash
clean this unclean world.

440
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,500
And you and your priest...

441
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,600
will help me do it.

442
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:09,600
He's gonna kill her, isn't
he? If she's infected?

443
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,200
She talked about him. Said
she never got to know him.

444
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,900
She wanted to.

445
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,600
What kind of man would kill
his own flesh and blood?

446
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,200
If she becomes a familiar,
she's no ones flesh and blood.

447
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,500
Not anymore.

448
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:16,700
I've held on to it all these years...

449
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,600
to remind me of everything
they've stripped away from us.

450
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:25,800
Our honor, our abilities, our faith...

451
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,300
Today when we ride, I
want you to remember

452
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,500
our power doesn't come
from the Church...

453
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,500
it comes from God.

454
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:50,600
With or without the Clergy,
we're still priests.

455
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,300
I can't.

456
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,700
When I heard what happened to Shannon...

457
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,500
I prayed for her salvation.

458
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,100
And then I prayed for mine.

459
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:37,300
Because in the darkness of my heart...

460
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:43,700
I hoped her death
would free you at last.

461
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:30,500
- Tell me you won't kill her.
- Hicks, don't do this.

462
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,600
Tell me, or I will shoot
you where you stand.

463
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,800
It would be easier to face you bullet
here than face what may lie up ahead.

464
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:45,100
Why do you even care? She is
nothing but a stranger to you.

465
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,700
She's his daughter.

466
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:54,200
- She was just a baby when the Clergy took me.
- You're lying. I knew Owen.

467
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,400
The child needed a father.

468
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,900
We all made sacrifices.

469
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,600
Hicks.

470
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:14,700
If you do this, it won't
matter if you find Lucy.

471
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:21,100
It won't stop the train, and
you won't be able to save her.

472
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:25,200
You won't save her.

473
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:39,000
We ride out and meet this together.

474
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:58,600
When the time comes, you blow the
tracks and then you get out of there!

475
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:04,200
What if you're still on the train?

476
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,200
Good-luck.

477
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,800
Focus!

478
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,500
Holy shit.

479
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:09,600
Hello, my friend.

480
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:34,000
- You fell!
- You let go!

481
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:40,200
In the depths of that hive, I crossed
the threshold between life and death.

482
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,800
And do you know what I found?

483
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:50,700
The queen we had come to
kill, my angel of mercy.

484
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:57,100
She turned me into something that
had never existed in this world.

485
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,900
A human vampire.

486
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,800
Join me. Accept the blood of the queen.

487
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,900
And together we can
return to the cities...

488
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,100
as brothers.

489
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:18,500
- Where's my daughter?
- Waiting for your decision.

490
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:43,700
You can't win. I'm stronger
now than you ever were.

491
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,800
This is your last chance, Priest.

492
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,400
The queens hands have not been idle.

493
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,800
Mankind will find no
quarter from what's coming.

494
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,100
Join me, and your life of
sacrifice will be over.

495
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,800
Never.

496
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,300
Hicks!

497
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,900
Lucy!

498
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,200
Did you find her?

499
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:52,400
I couldn't get close. They
took her to the front.

500
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:13,000
- You would have made a good priest.
- Thanks.

501
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,100
Don't let it go to your head.

502
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,200
- Hicks!
- Lucy!

503
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,600
No!

504
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,000
Stop it!

505
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,300
No, Lucy!

506
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,400
Very good! Fast.

507
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,800
Just like your father.

508
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,300
He never told you?

509
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,900
Oh, god!

510
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,700
Burn.

511
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:05,900
At this time of need, strengthen me.

512
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,100
You are my refuge and strength...

513
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:15,800
I do not fear, for you are with me.

514
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,900
I won't let you go!

515
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:43,700
Your faith has failed you!

516
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:58,100
No!

517
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,600
For the life of the
flesh is in the blood.

518
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:16,400
And I have given it to
you upon the altar...

519
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,900
to make atonement for your souls.

520
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,700
How dare you come back
to this holy place?

521
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:47,100
A man who would defy the Church,
for his own selfish crusade!

522
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:03,200
Look inside the burning train
just behind these cities walls...

523
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,600
you'll find hundreds more like it.

524
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,400
- And their queen was not among them.
- Lies!

525
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:17,300
This man is a charlatan. A risk
to the security of the cities.

526
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,500
There is no vampire menace!

527
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:24,600
- The war is over, Priest!
- No.

528
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,700
It's just beginning.

529
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,700
I've notified the others. We'll meet
you at the rendezvous at City 7.

530
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,900
Godspeed!

530
01:19:49,305 --> 01:20:49,296
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
