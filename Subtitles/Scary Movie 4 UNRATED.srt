00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,770
Oh!

3
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,070
Ow!

4
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,240
Help! Help!

5
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,540
Am I dead?

6
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,210
You're not dead.

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,650
You've been taken
against your will.

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,620
Kobe? Who is that?

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,260
Dr. Phil?
What the hell's going on?

10
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,030
I don't know. I was doing a show
on teens with abandonment issues...

11
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,830
and suddenly, I woke up here.

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,000
Man, those kids
are gonna be pissed.

13
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,930
Hello, gentlemen.

14
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,570
You don't know me,
but I know you.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,880
You both play games
with other people for a living...

16
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,850
but, today, you play a game
for your lives.

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,790
Right now, you are both
breathing in a deadly nerve gas.

18
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,820
You have 120 seconds to reach
the antidote...

19
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,190
or you die.

20
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,280
Oh, my God!
We better get out of here!

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,450
Let the game begin.

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,460
There!

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,210
Hit the metal arm
with something.

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,870
There.

25
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,110
Damn it!

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,720
Sorry.

27
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,130
Shaquille, I'm not angry at you...

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,030
but we are one minute
away from death.

29
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,500
Just shut out the "No" voice.

30
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,000
Own your success.

31
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,830
Oh!

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,580
Just make the damn basket!

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,980
What the hell was that for?

34
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,750
You hurt my feelings.

35
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,880
Your feelings?
To hell with your feelings!

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,080
Everybody with their feelings!

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,180
"I'm obese."
"My kid's a brat." "Help me. Help me."

38
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,520
Just shut up!

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,590
Why can't I fix anyone?

40
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,120
I'm so dumb and worthless!
Mama was right! Mama was right!

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,900
Hey, hey! Pull yourself together.
You're a brilliant doctor.

42
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,000
Not exactly.

43
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,200
- What?
- I-I just tell people to "get real."

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,710
I'm not even a psychologist.

45
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,510
I'm... an electrician.

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,020
I failed you, Shaq.
I failed you.

47
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,890
- Booyah!
- Yes!

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,860
30 seconds left!

49
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,140
This will never work.

50
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,270
Of course- he wants us
to cut through our feet.

51
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,380
You go first.

52
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,750
Bullshit.

53
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,750
Yeah.

54
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,810
You're probably not man enough.

55
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,580
I guess your mama was right.

56
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,380
Never!

57
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,790
Who's the coward now, Mama?

58
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,800
Candy from a baby.

59
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,990
- Oh, my God!
- I did it. We're saved.

60
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,630
- What's wrong?
- Wrong foot.

61
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,440
Motherfu-

62
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,760
No one believed

63
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,560
in the early years
of the 21st century

64
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,660
that our world was being
watched...

65
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,640
the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize the creatures

66
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,470
in a drop of water.

67
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,120
Yet across the gulf of space

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,760
a terrible evil prepared
to unleash itself

69
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,730
upon an unsuspecting human race.

70
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,080
You're up early.
Come back to bed.

71
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,750
Come on.

72
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,090
Please.

73
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,570
Hello? Hello?

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,380
Tom! Oh!

75
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,120
I know you missed me.
Oh, I missed you too. God, you look great.

76
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,680
I wanted to come by to thank you
for setting up that job interview for me.

77
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,290
This isn't a good time.

78
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,930
I just need something to keep me busy
now that Cody's out of the house.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,970
He just turned 11.

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,770
I enrolled him in military
school last year.

81
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,100
It's supposed to be
a great program.

82
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,230
Boy, kids, you know,
they just grow up so fast.

83
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,780
So I heard
that you were dating again.

84
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,080
Knowing you,
I bet she's brainy.

85
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,640
"Quixotic."

86
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,340
90 points!

87
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,060
Oh, you know, your work with
the elderly really inspired me, Tom.

88
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,760
I mean, they have
so much to teach us...

89
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,970
and we have so much
to teach them.

90
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,980
You know, ultimately, they...
really are just like us...

91
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,600
only... older.

92
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,170
Anyway, I'm hoping that
a new career will help

93
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,780
keep my mind off of...
bad memories.

94
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,020
I'm sure you have memories, too.
He's the kind of person you never forget.

95
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,120
Sometimes, I wake up in
the middle of the night

96
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,920
wondering where he is,
and then I remember.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,460
I know you miss him, too,
but it's really been hardest on me.

98
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,500
I'm rattling on, but if you
don't vent your emotions...

99
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,230
they just well up inside of you
and burst out.

100
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,040
The harder you try,
the harder it all gets...

101
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,410
till you just can't
shake it off anymore.

102
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,470
Oh!

103
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,540
Like you're carrying around
this enormous burden.

104
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,640
Sometimes your problems
get so big.

105
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,020
- And then what do you say to yourself?
- Jesus!

106
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,490
Yes, you can turn to religion
or family and friends...

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,150
but in the end,
you're still in agony.

108
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,720
Maybe that's why
I want to become a nurse.

109
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,700
I'm just- I'm so in tune
with everyone's emotions.

110
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,500
I guess I've always had
a knack for being-

111
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,170
Oh, my-

112
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,900
Ryan, go home.
You've been working 16 straight hours.

113
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,240
Come on, I need the overtime.

114
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,210
Don't worry. Okay?

115
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,740
I'm wide-

116
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,280
Ryan! What are you doing?

117
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,150
That was gold bullion-

118
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,280
No, not the monkeys!

119
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,070
They're loose!

120
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,670
Damn it, Tom!
What the hell happened back there?

121
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,830
Aw, come on, Ed.
That could've happened to anyone.

122
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,500
Oh, yeah?
You know what your problem is?

123
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,640
As soon as the going gets tough,
you give up.

124
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,080
You're right. I quit.

125
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,810
Ah, you don't get it, do you?

126
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,850
You could be the best,
if only you'd see things through.

127
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,410
- I don't know.
- Give me a break.

128
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,620
What can I tell you, Ed?
I guess I'm no good.

129
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,420
Maybe I just don't have what it takes.

130
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,400
What are you talking about?
You secured that tricky H-500 unit, didn't you?

131
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,260
Aw, come on. That was easy.

132
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,980
Tom Ryan.
I haven't seen you in a while.

133
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,240
Well, I spend every waking minute
of my life operating a crane.

134
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,310
God, I hate my job.

135
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,080
Yo, Tom! Where you been?

136
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,650
Mahalik.

137
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,560
Yo, C.J.,
this is my boy Tom Ryan.

138
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,790
We used to work together
down at the docks.

139
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,020
Ya-hi! Ya-hi! Ya-hi!

140
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,760
- Hey, Tom. How's the family, man?
- You remember Marilyn?

141
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,360
- Your lovely wife- how could I forget?
- She dumped me.

142
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,370
Yeah, I know.
I slept with her a few times.

143
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,870
- What?
- Me too.

144
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,970
You guys talking about Marilyn?
Great lay.

145
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,310
My pops introduced me to her.

146
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,410
Ever since the divorce,
it's like my life has no purpose.

147
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,280
Half the time I walk around
feeling like a zombie.

148
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,720
Yo, don't joke about zombies.
That shit there- that's real.

149
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,220
Yo, you know Nashawn,
down on 120th Street?

150
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,280
Yeah.

151
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,120
She told me that she heard a zombie
going through her trash the other day.

152
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,030
The next morning,
she turned up missing.

153
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,220
- Uh-
- What? Okay, back up.

154
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,230
How in the hell
do you "turn up missing"?

155
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,000
'Cause nobody knows where you are
when they realize you ain't there!

156
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,330
Guys, I'm trying to ask-

157
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,500
So you telling me that you can appear
and disappear at the same time.

158
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,100
No, man. You can't appear
and disappear at the same time.

159
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,200
- The bitch ain't David Copperfield!
- Uh, guys-

160
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,680
Mmm. No, no.

161
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,180
But you can't be gone from one place
and show up somewhere else entirely.

162
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,240
So when you turn up,
you're never missing.

163
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,680
And when you're missing,
you never turn up.

164
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,380
Unless... you a zombie.

165
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,890
Damn!

166
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,890
Hey, that's some plausible shit right there.
You should blog about that.

167
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,860
- I'm gonna put that on MySpace.
- You do that!

168
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,590
Hey, Tom.

169
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,690
You know what you need to do, man?
You need to get away from all this.

170
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,670
- You need to take a break.
- Oh, I don't know.

171
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,230
No, no. He's right, man. You should
come fishing with us one weekend.

172
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,280
Me and Mahalik, we found
this great spot last summer.

173
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah. A great spot.

174
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,290
Hey. You cold?

175
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,260
- L-Little bit.
- Hmm.

176
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,430
Hey. Look, man, um-

177
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,370
I'm not on the down-low
or nothing, all right?

178
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,880
Oh, that's cool, man.
Me, neither.

179
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,440
- Hey, what you doing?
- Relax, man.

180
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,950
I'm just trying to grab some nuts.

181
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,750
C.J., what are you doin'?

182
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,460
- I just wanna eat some peanuts.
- Huh?

183
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,860
See? Peanuts.

184
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,390
Ooh, baby.

185
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,230
Yeah...
we caught a lot of fish.

186
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah.

187
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,310
Black cod.

188
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,470
Damn.

189
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,450
Tom, you don't-
I don't want you thinking that-

190
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,350
Hopefully, this doesn't
affect your opin-

191
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,720
Why would you do that,
and that's my first time meeting him?

192
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,270
Late again, Tom.

193
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,540
- Hey, Marilyn.
- I thought you were moving.

194
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,510
It's all I can afford right now. You took
everything in the divorce except my name.

195
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,840
No, actually, the judge
granted me that yesterday.

196
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,210
You're now officially known
as "Horace P. MacTitties."

197
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,350
I'm sure your new husband is pleased.

198
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,080
He's a good man.
A provider, unlike you.

199
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,990
You never cared
about our children.

200
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,550
Hey, that's not true.
I'm a great dad.

201
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,100
Kids!

202
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,190
Dad?

203
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,200
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Rachel.

204
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,040
How's it going there,
uh... Princess?

205
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,910
It's locked.

206
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,670
Hey! Let me help you
with that, muffin.

207
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,240
- I should do that.
- It's no problem.

208
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,310
- I honestly don't mind.
- Neither do I.

209
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,250
Fine. You take it.

210
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,720
I'll see you on Tuesday.

211
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,120
Hey, Marilyn.

212
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,420
That's a good look for you,
being pregnant.

213
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,100
I'm not pregnant!

214
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,160
I didn't meant to-
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,100
If you want to make things right,
maybe you should start with our kids.

216
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,110
You're right. Those kids
are all I have in this world.

217
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,840
Well, the kids... and my car.

218
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,570
Ow!

219
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,240
Mr. Koji, looks like we need
someone new for the Norris account.

220
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,810
Again?

221
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,950
Every day we don't have someone looking
after this woman, I lose big money.

222
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,480
- What happened to last girl?
- Yoko. Take a look.

223
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,000
Holy shit!

224
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,660
Someone put a towel under her
or something. Christ!

225
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,640
It's the Norris house, Mr. Koji.
They say it's cursed.

226
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,700
There no such thing as a curse.

227
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,440
Don't be ridiculous.

228
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,880
Those just old wives' tales.

229
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,610
I need someone there today
or I'm in big trouble.

230
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,610
Hello. I'm Cindy Campbell.

231
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,950
I'm looking for a job
in home health care.

232
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,880
I was recommended by a family friend,
but unfortunately, he committed-

233
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,720
Oh, my God!

234
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,860
Don't mind her.
She slip and fall.

235
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,230
You my new best employee.
Ready start today?

236
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,240
Oh, it's so fast. I don't know.

237
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,570
Oh, trust me.
Uh, you're gonna love this job.

238
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,070
Come on, I show you.
We can be there 10 minutes.

239
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,250
Come! Come!

240
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,600
Mr. Koji?

241
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,700
Hello?

242
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,050
Oh, my God! Oh!

243
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,450
Okay, oh.

244
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,890
- Oh, let's get you up and-
- Oh!

245
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,550
Okay, come on.
Here we go.

246
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,250
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- There you are.

247
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,130
I see you've met Mrs. Norris-
she catatonic.

248
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,670
Yes, I was just trying
to get her back up on the bed.

249
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,790
I was afraid
that she would be hurt.

250
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,060
You know, when I came in,
I just saw her lying here on the floor.

251
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,870
Of course, of course. I help.
You grab her legs, I grab her arms.

252
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,240
Mrs. Norris,
I'm here to take care of you.

253
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,140
Yes, I'm very happy
to meet you, too.

254
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,220
See? This job perfect for you.
Let me show you rest of house.

255
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,380
Right this way.

256
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,420
So, what do you think?

257
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,390
I don't know. There's something
strange about this house.

258
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,230
- A presence.
- A presence? Don't be silly.

259
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,060
- Nothing wrong with this house.
- It's funny.

260
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,570
I always dreamt I would live
in a house like this with my husband...

261
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,770
but I guess that's all just in the...

262
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,100
past.

263
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,270
Who wants to see upstairs?

264
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,610
It's a nice neighborhood
close to schools and shopping.

265
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,120
There are hardwood floors throughout.
Passed almost every inspection.

266
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,750
Big backyard goes back 100 feet.

267
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,300
And in here is the bathroom.

268
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,990
Very big, very...

269
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,830
nice.

270
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,460
It is nice.

271
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,770
It seems like
it'd be a great place to work...

272
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,640
but I just can't shake
this feeling of... evil.

273
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,680
Evil? That crazy talk.

274
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,980
Do you know anything about
the people who used to live here?

275
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,680
People? No, nothing about people.
I don't remember anything.

276
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,190
Mr. Koji, did something strange
happen in this house?

277
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,850
Strange? Don't be silly.

278
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,830
This house perfectly normal.

279
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,660
I'm sure you're right, and yet...
it's as if someone's watching us.

280
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,690
Mr. Koji?

281
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,140
That was me...
just excited about hiring you.

282
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,140
Very, very enthusiastic!

283
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,910
We offer medical and dental
and two weeks' paid vacation!

284
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,510
I'm hoping...
you can start today!

285
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,650
Maybe get in a whole week!

286
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,420
You put in for this job...

287
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,690
we got wonderful opportunities for you.

288
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,220
Mr. Koji, is there something
you're not telling me about this?

289
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,870
I was... dirty.

290
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,010
So... the job?

291
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,700
I'll take it.

292
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,780
Get your glove!
I'm in the backyard!

293
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,790
Robbie, come on.
Let's go!

294
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,690
That's not how you're going
to get through to him.

295
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,960
Look, Rach, this is guy stuff.

296
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,230
You got to trust me.

297
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,230
All right, Robbie, you ready
for the Tom Ryan Express?

298
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,080
Yeah, maybe, one day,
I can grow up to be just like you.

299
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,210
All right,
I know I let you kids down...

300
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,980
but you have no idea
how hard it is to be a father.

301
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,650
Well, when you start,
let me know.

302
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,760
You okay?

303
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,430
My eyes! My eyes!

304
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,240
Oh, much... better.

305
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,440
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

306
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,640
I've taken balls
to the face before.

307
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,520
Hi. I'm Cindy Campbell,
your new neighbor.

308
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,560
Tom, Tom Ryan.

309
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,090
You, uh, live here
all by yourself?

310
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,150
Well, I'm-I'm taking care
of Mrs. Norris...

311
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,960
but... yes, for the first time
in my life, I'm on my own.

312
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,460
I know that feeling.

313
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,830
- It wasn't always that way.
- I know.

314
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,030
You thought you'd found
your soul mate.

315
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,040
Yes.

316
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,100
And then one day
you come home...

317
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,480
and find your so-called soul mate
in bed with a complete stranger.

318
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,810
Well, not a complete stranger-
Sammy Sosa.

319
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,150
Sound familiar?

320
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,350
No, not at all.

321
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,590
But I do know what it's like
to be in that much pain...

322
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,490
and the worst part is
you have to suffer through it-

323
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,960
- Alone?
- It looks like we have a lot in-

324
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,500
Common.

325
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,260
- We're already finishing each other's-
- Dinner.

326
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,770
Sentences.

327
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,970
Well... maybe all we really need
is a friend.

328
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,610
I'd like that.

329
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,950
Well, I better get back
to Mrs. Norris.

330
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,490
It's time to put her catheter in,
and then after that...

331
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,540
I've got to scrub
in between her fat folds...

332
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,750
and I've got to lance her boils.

333
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,590
I've got to open her up
and then-

334
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,590
...empty the colostomy bag and...

335
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,850
Mop up the drool.

336
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,790
That's wonderful.

337
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,530
- I'll see you around?
- Definitely.

338
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,690
Okay.

339
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,760
Okay, Mrs. Norris,
time to dig out that doody bubble.

340
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,930
Whoa... Oh! Ow!

341
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,880
Mrs. Norris?

342
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,520
Have you noticed anything
strange about this house?

343
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,530
- Yes! Yes!
- No?

344
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,560
Yes!

345
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,430
Oh, you're probably right.
Guess I'm just being silly.

346
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,470
Just relax now.

347
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,270
Here we go. Okay.

348
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,570
Oh, you poor thing.
You don't have to be scared.

349
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,740
I'm here to take care of you.

350
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,180
You know, I think you and I
are going to be wonderful friends.

351
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,050
I do. That's right. Just relax.

352
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,520
Let's get in those ears.

353
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,460
Okay. All right.

354
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,160
That's right.
Oh, it feels good.

355
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,800
Okay.

356
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,360
You love this, don't you?

357
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,740
It's nice and warm.
Feels good, doesn't it?

358
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,970
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

359
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,410
I'm so sorry!

360
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,390
Robbie!

361
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,400
Come on!

362
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,730
Let's toss the old pigskin!

363
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,530
Ooh.

364
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,510
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.
Are you all right?

365
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,170
It's okay.
My throat cushioned the blow.

366
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,840
Thank God.
I lost my temper. My son's-

367
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,180
What's wrong?
You look scared.

368
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,120
Oh, nothing. It's just-

369
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,620
There's something
going on in this house.

370
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,960
Last night, I saw a face.

371
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,690
- Did it have a nose?
- Yes.

372
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,530
That does sound like a face.

373
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,060
And then there was
this weird hand in the shower...

374
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,400
and this horrible thing
on the stairs.

375
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,800
I can't go through
this all again.

376
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,870
Oh, I get it.
There's some other guy.

377
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,110
You still love him, don't you?
I wish you both the best.

378
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,210
Wait! You don't understand.

379
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,150
It's painful to talk about,
but you deserve to know.

380
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,420
I was married once.

381
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,720
- Get out the way, bitch!
- Don't call me no bitch! You ain't shit!

382
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,660
Shut your ass up, snow ho!

383
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,800
Well... actually, married twice.

384
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,630
My husband and I
were living our dream.

385
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:04,370
Ladies and gentlemen,
your challenger, Cindy Campbell.

386
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,640
Stay loose, Cindy.
Remember your training. Keep your focus.

387
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,790
Always think, where's
the next punch coming-

388
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,480
After 20 fights, I was undefeated.

389
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,680
Only one fighter stood
between me and the belt.

390
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,750
You got this chick.
She's nothing.

391
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,560
Tiffany Stone!

392
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,670
Cindy, listen to me.

393
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,430
I know you're scared, but I believe in you.
You can win this.

394
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,810
And if I do win, George, then will you
tell me what my nickname means?

395
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,810
Yes. I promise.

396
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,610
Okay. Now just stick with the jab
and lead with your right.

397
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,710
Watch your footwork.

398
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,310
Let's go!

399
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,490
Whoa, whoa! You do that one more time,
I'm taking a point off, you hear me?

400
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,970
I got it, I got it!
Dude, check it out!

401
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,970
I can't take it anymore!

402
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,350
And that's when I lost my cool

403
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,720
and made the biggest mistake
of my life.

404
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,730
Cindy, no!

405
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,430
Ooh, a nickel!

406
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,000
No!

407
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,580
Get out of the way!

408
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,950
George!

409
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,620
No!

410
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,020
If I hadn't have thrown that punch,
none of it would've happened.

411
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,890
- I blame myself for it all.
- As well you should.

412
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,900
But, Cindy, the past is the past.

413
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,630
Maybe you ought to think
about your future.

414
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
If I'm ever going to love again...

415
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,210
it has to be with somebody
who'll be there for me.

416
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,610
Well, I don't have a great track record
in that department. Just ask my son.

417
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,380
I have.
What's an "cock monger"?

418
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,940
Uh... that's not really important.

419
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,540
What matters is
I've let a lot of people down.

420
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,020
Oh.

421
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,250
- I should go.
- Wait!

422
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,850
Maybe I'm just not meant
to be happy...

423
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,190
but something about you
makes me want to try.

424
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,920
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

425
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,320
Why is the sky so dark?

426
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,490
Why is the wind moving
towards the storm?

427
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,770
Why don't any of us have driers?

428
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,290
I've never seen clouds
like that before!

429
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,050
- You okay?
- Yeah.

430
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,050
- Can you believe that thunder?
- No.

431
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,090
That storm is so fierce.
I've never seen anything like it.

432
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,890
- I haven't either.
- Imagine being out there.

433
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,330
That last one sounded really close.

434
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,520
Don't worry- lightning never
strikes in the same place twice.

435
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,300
- Where's Rachel?
- I thought she was with you.

436
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,410
Oh, there you are.

437
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,180
Okay. That's it. We're fine.

438
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,780
That last bolt of lightning
smelled like a-

439
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,020
Giant turd.

440
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,080
Yes, the... lightning.

441
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,650
I'll go look for Robbie.

442
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,590
Turn it again,
see if it'll start.

443
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,800
I don't know what's going on.
The car's not working, it's just not working.

444
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,870
Start!

445
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,280
Go!

446
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,350
My bowels have stopped moving!
Why?

447
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,510
- How's it going, Marvin?
- I just had this car working; now it's dead.

448
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,180
- Try changing the solenoid.
- Good idea.

449
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,520
Death to America!

450
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,690
Aw, shit!

451
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,670
Run!

452
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,330
Beautiful outfit!

453
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Thanks.

454
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,440
- Where's your ride, G?
- Move it, dawg!

455
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,320
Hello?

456
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,460
"Haro"?

457
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,720
Hibachi. Benihana. Teriyaki.

458
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Nagasaki. Okinawa.
Hokkaido. Yokohama.

459
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,010
Karate. Judo. Sumo. Samurai.

460
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,010
Nissan. Honda. Mitsubishi. Subaru.

461
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,910
Hara-kiri. Tsunami.
Kamikaze. Banzai.

462
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,110
Yamaha. Nikon. Casio. Aiwa.

463
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,360
Minolta. Hitachi. Seiko. Toshiba.

464
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,920
Buddha! Shitake kimono!

465
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,870
Tempura. Sushi. Sashimi!

466
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,660
Fujitsu!

467
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,810
I can't read that.

468
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,440
That's better.

469
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,290
Let's go, honey!
Let's go! Let's go!

470
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,280
Robbie, Dad's home!

471
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,560
What is it?
What's going on?

472
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,860
Death.

473
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,570
- Dad, talk to me. What's happening?
- There's no time to explain.

474
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,380
Alien attack!

475
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,320
Well, actually,
that about sums it up.

476
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,820
Fill this up with food.
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

477
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,560
My ass!

478
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,000
Penis.

479
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,030
We gotta go.

480
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,430
- Cindy!
- Tom!

481
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,410
- Run for it!
- Where are you going?

482
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,380
Someone's out there, somebody
who knows a way to stop all of this.

483
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,540
- Oh, you wouldn't understand.
- I understand.

484
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,110
- Come with me.
- Oh, I'd like to, but my kids.

485
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,090
I... guess this is good-bye.

486
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,650
When this is all over, promise me that
you'll find me, that you'll never forget me...

487
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,630
that you won't give up
until I'm back in your arms.

488
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,030
- Alive?
- Yes.

489
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,860
I promise.

490
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,060
Good-bye, Cindy.

491
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,810
Hey, wait!

492
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,610
A solenoid... for luck.

493
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,780
Marvin!
You put a solenoid in?

494
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,190
Yeah, I got one
from that crackhead over there.

495
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,930
- Get in.
- Why should we?

496
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,830
Because you're my responsibility now,
and like it or not, I'm all you've got.

497
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,870
Ow!

498
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,140
- Hey. Hey!
- Thank God.

499
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,340
Hey! What are you doing?

500
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,350
- Get in the car, Marvin.
- Come on, Tom, stop joking around.

501
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,940
Get in the car, Marvin,
or you're gonna die.

502
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,420
Okay, fine.

503
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,190
- No, wait for me to-
- Still locked.

504
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,850
- Why are you reaching at the same time?
- What do you mean?

505
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,730
- All right, on three.
- You counting now?

506
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,820
One, two, three, open the door!

507
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,230
- Okay, on three.
- One, two-

508
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,000
Three.

509
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,370
- Don't do that. You're trying to annoy me.
- It's still locked.

510
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,430
I'm going on three. One, two-

511
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,100
Don't count when I count.
I have a problem with that.

512
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,970
- What's the matter with you?
- Turn your mouth sideways.

513
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,240
- If you look at me I lose count.
- What are you crazy?

514
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,650
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

515
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,050
- Don't do it the same time.
- You said "three."

516
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,640
- You go on "four." Can you count?
- Four.

517
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,150
- So on your "three" or my "four"?
- There's only one "three."

518
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,520
- I'm tryin' to get in the car.
- Then you do it on "four."

519
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,290
You said, "three." So are you doin' it
on "three" or am I doin' it on "two"?

520
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,190
- For Christ's sake!
- I heard "three."

521
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,820
If the count is "three,"
you do it on "four."

522
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,490
- Now it's "four."
- Why would you go on "four"?

523
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,430
You gave me "four" first
and you stole my "four."

524
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,160
- But I have to count to "three" first.
- You stole my "four."

525
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,640
- Just let me say "three."
- I've got wait on you now, huh?

526
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,260
- You want the black man to wait again?
- Do whatever you want.

527
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,280
- That's what I've been doin'.
- Why would you do that?

528
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,870
Why would you reach for it when
I say "three"? That's what this is about.

529
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,410
Do I still go on "four"?

530
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,680
When I say "three,"
don't worry about "four."

531
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,180
You got all the time in the world!

532
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,350
You can go home, watch television
and come back and then open the door!

533
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,620
- Fine.
- One-

534
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,250
No. No "one." I'm out.
No thank you.

535
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,890
I'll take the next one.
Does that work for you?

536
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,190
- Jesus.
- Attitude.

537
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,060
Seriously, I'd rather be dead.

538
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,270
GIRL
"A girl had a pet duck.

539
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,540
"She fed and took care
of her pet duck.

540
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:48,270
"But one day, the duck got loose
and ran away from the girl.

541
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,910
"The duck ran down the road
and kept running...

542
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,640
until he found a pond."

543
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,350
Mr. President,
we've just received word...

544
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,720
the planet is under attack by aliens.

545
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,380
Oh. Okay.

546
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,220
"The duck went back"-

547
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,200
Sir? They've already wiped out
some of our cities.

548
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,660
If nothing is done,
they'll kill us all.

549
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,930
I see. Well, I'll handle that
in a minute.

550
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,600
But right now, I need to find out
what's happening with the duck.

551
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,400
Sir, with each passing moment,
more people will die.

552
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,910
The people are gonna die
regardless...

553
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,570
but this duck still has
a fighting chance.

554
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:27,310
I've read the story before, Mr. President.

555
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,410
The duck dies.

556
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,410
My God!
That's horrible.

557
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,520
Mr. President, the aliens?
We're under attack.

558
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,430
You mean, right now all of these
children's parents could be dead?

559
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,490
Kids! Kids, please!

560
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,940
It's not as bad as it seems.

561
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,600
They didn't die alone. I'm sure they
died with all the other people you loved.

562
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,540
Even Santa Claus?

563
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,580
No, of course not.
There's no such thing as Santa Claus.

564
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,520
Just like the Tooth Fairy,
completely made up.

565
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,950
Easter Bunny-
Never existed.

566
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,320
The female orgasm.

567
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,360
Wait and see what happens
when you try to find it.

568
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,370
What's wrong? Your parents
all getting divorces?

569
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,630
I can give them a little advice,
if you'd like.

570
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,540
Oh, I forgot.
They're all dead.

571
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,870
All right now, let's go on to
another story, "Rumpelforeskin."

572
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,640
"Stiltzkin," sir.
We have to get you to the White House.

573
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,380
I just don't get kids.

574
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,510
- Remind me to sign that abortion bill.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,790
You may leave
through the forward exit doors...

576
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,130
or the gaping hole
in the side of the plane.

577
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,190
We realize you have
a choice in airlines...

578
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,430
and we appreciate
you flying with Southern Coast Air.

579
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,810
- Thank you.
- Hello?

580
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,050
Hey! That's mine! I found it!

581
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,180
- Cindy?
- Brenda?

582
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,750
Oh, my God.
It's been so long.

583
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,220
Yeah, too long.

584
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,190
I thought you were dead.

585
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,250
Oh, I thought
you were dead, too.

586
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,730
What are you doing here?
Were you on this plane?

587
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,860
No, I'm trying to get a good story.

588
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,660
I'm a reporter now.
I work for the local news.

589
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,330
Wow, you're really doing
well for yourself.

590
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,930
I was on assignment.
Take a look at this.

591
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,700
Here's Detroit.

592
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,000
And here's Detroit after the attack.

593
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,550
Oh, my God.

594
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,280
The attack was devastating.

595
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,050
It's over, Cindy.
Humanity has lost the war.

596
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,120
No, no. There's still hope.

597
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,990
I have reason to believe that there's
someone here that has the answers...

598
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,330
maybe even a way for us to fight back.

599
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,730
Come on.
It would make a great story.

600
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,140
Maybe. But how are
we supposed to get there?

601
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,140
None of these cars work.

602
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,070
Wait. See if this works.

603
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,380
Hey! I got the last working car
in New York!

604
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,380
This is our road, bitches! Ha-ha!

605
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,820
You're right, Cindy.
That worked pretty well.

606
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,220
I-

607
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,100
Look at all the injured.

608
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,770
It's so sad.

609
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,530
Big-ass rat, man!

610
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,510
Oh! That sewer took forever to fix!

611
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,280
Man, I'm gonna need
a hot bath after all of that-

612
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,010
What the hell happened here?

613
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,290
- Zombies!
- Damn!

614
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,230
Let's go!

615
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,360
Don't let 'em bite you!

616
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,230
Good news!
They can still feel electricity.

617
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,430
Grandma?
The zombies have got my grandma!

618
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,230
Die, Grandma! Die! Die!

619
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,970
- I loved you! I loved you!
- Mahalik?

620
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,410
Look what they did
to my grandmama!

621
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,880
Whoa!

622
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,250
That woman raised me from birth.

623
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,830
Hey, he's got a car. He's got a car.

624
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,890
Give us the car and the keys!

625
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,560
This isn't my car.
I would, but I can't. It's not my car.

626
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,470
It's not my car. Don't worry, kids.
The doors are locked.

627
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,240
There's no possible way they can-

628
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:46,900
Pull the robot out of chocolate.
But that's just common sense. Oh, waiter!

629
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,440
- Daddy!
- Kids!

630
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,610
Whoa!

631
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,960
Why?

632
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,090
Well.

633
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,130
Get back! Get back!

634
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,730
Gimme the gun.
I'm taking the car.

635
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,800
What do I do about him?

636
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,210
I don't want the car.
I just need a gun.

637
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,540
No way I'm giving up the gun.
I want the car.

638
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,600
So, you need a gun,
and you want a car.

639
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,880
- What do you want?
- Well, I've never owned a knife.

640
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,610
Okay. Let's all switch on three.

641
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,560
One, two, three.

642
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,530
Is this right?

643
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,720
I don't think so.

644
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:44,490
Dad, they're taking the car.

645
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:48,230
Yes, well, uh, let's keep going.

646
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,240
What?
That's it? You're giving up?

647
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,640
Yeah, that's right. I'm giving up.

648
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,040
You want a hero?
Go find someone else.

649
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,520
Why?

650
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,550
Let's go.

651
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,990
Now, let me get this straight:

652
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,960
The girl hugged the duck,
and then it dies?

653
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,590
Mr. President,
the nation is under attack.

654
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,360
Get me Homer Landsquiddy.

655
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,920
You mean, "Homeland Security."

656
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,200
Sir, this woman was an eyewitness
to one of the attacks.

657
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:22,870
- What can you tell us?
- They're indestructible.

658
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,600
The clothing was burned off
everyone's bodies.

659
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,310
There were naked people
everywhere.

660
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,850
- Were you naked?
- No.

661
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,710
Thank God.
Some good news at last.

662
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,620
Get her a souvenir.

663
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,200
Lil' Kim-
Lil' Kim got my sandwich.

664
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,440
Look out-
Russell Crowe's got a phone!

665
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,070
R. Kelly, don't pee on me!

666
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,240
My lovely lady lumps!

667
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,310
Where are we?

668
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:13,590
I'm not sure,
but I think we're close.

669
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,120
It's supposed to be near mile 62.

670
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,930
Is something wrong?

671
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,300
No, it's just...

672
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:24,800
I met this guy,
and I wonder if he's safe.

673
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,800
Oh, you'd love him, Brenda.

674
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,930
What's his name?
I might've already loved him.

675
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,770
Tom Ryan.

676
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,970
Yeah, did him.
Big, fat Chinese guy?

677
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:38,140
No... No.

678
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,580
But he is the kind of guy that I'd like
to share the rest of my life with.

679
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,750
Cindy! Look!

680
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,460
What is this place?

681
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,270
I don't know, but the boy's father's
somewhere in there.

682
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,270
We'll have to sneak our way in.

683
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,330
But we're not gonna
blend in dressed like this.

684
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,350
- Brenda, look.
- He's a wonderful boy.

685
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,910
Ezekiel?

686
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,910
Ezekiel, where are you?

687
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,750
Ezekiel,
shall we have a foot race?

688
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,760
No cheating.

689
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,210
That's him!

690
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,580
He's cute.

691
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:27,420
Friends, friends. Do not fear the noise
of those of whom we do not speak.

692
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:29,690
There is a gentle truce
between our village

693
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,290
and the creatures
beyond their borders.

694
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,230
Now, who would like to say grace?

695
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,200
Ooh!

696
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,100
Ah, Ezekiel.

697
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,400
Pee-pee.

698
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,410
Pee-pee vagina.

699
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,740
Amen.

700
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:59,120
Father?

701
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:01,850
Holly.

702
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,260
For what purpose
do you interrupt

703
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:08,730
the celebration
of the domestic partnership

704
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,100
of Mordecai and Hoss?

705
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,100
The guards caught
two outsiders near the cabin.

706
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,240
Who are you?

707
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,370
I must speak with you.
I was sent by your son.

708
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,510
Don't be ridiculous.

709
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,850
- I have no son.
- That's not true!

710
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,220
I know who you are.
I've seen the pictures.

711
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,420
- I was young. I needed the work.
- No.

712
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,090
At Mrs. Norris's house.

713
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,560
I didn't know whose house it was.

714
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,060
They drugged me.
Never mind that.

715
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:45,260
You're outsiders.
The council will decide your fates.

716
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,900
The question of the outsiders
is now at hand.

717
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,580
But first, Martha,
have you some tidings?

718
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,020
Nathaniel Winston
and Alice Smith

719
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,050
have informed me
of their intentions.

720
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,320
He intends to have sex with her
as soon as possible.

721
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:10,450
She intends to put up a mild fight
and then give in.

722
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:19,990
Amos, something does trouble you?

723
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,440
We now have a majority
of those who wish to say "I'm"...

724
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,840
instead of “I am."

725
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,250
- I'm for that.
- I am against it.

726
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,680
Silence!

727
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,620
We have more important matters
to discuss.

728
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:39,150
I fear that the presence
of the outsiders

729
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,680
will attract those of whom
we do not speak.

730
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,960
If you talk about those
of whom we do not speak...

731
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,330
have you not spoken of that

732
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,200
about which we do not talk?

733
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,200
Do not speak of that
of about which

734
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:58,070
we talk of not speaking...
about.

735
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,050
Elder Hale. We should welcome
the outsiders among us.

736
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,580
Jeremiah, ought not
your tongue be held?

737
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,390
I am sorry, Elder Hale...

738
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,660
but sometimes my tongue wiggles
beyond my ability to control it.

739
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:27,370
This is a problem with which
I have had much experience.

740
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,530
Maybe I could help him in a room
in which there are no others.

741
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:34,140
Or you can all watch.
I don't give a shit.

742
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,050
Silence.

743
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:45,210
After this, how about you take
your thing of which we do not speak...

744
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,490
and slide it up in my place
of which I like-

745
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,490
Silence!

746
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,890
The elders will consult.

747
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,100
Ah. Much better.

748
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:39,240
I'm not in my house, am I?

749
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,210
No.

750
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:49,120
Outsiders, we have decided
to let you stay with us...

751
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:52,490
so that you'll be safe from
those from of whom we do not-

752
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,680
Or don't.

753
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,250
Speak.

754
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:59,350
But now that you are
a part of our village...

755
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,490
understand this:

756
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,690
You may never leave.

757
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:07,000
No! No!

758
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:09,600
How did your son die?

759
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,200
- The fate of the world is at stake.
- You know what to do.

760
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,940
Was it you? Did you kill him?

761
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,950
This is some shit
up with which we will not put.

762
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:18,510
- I'm for that.
- I am against it.

763
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:25,120
This village isn't
what it used to be.

764
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,890
Just hours after
the devastating alien attack...

765
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,260
world leaders have gathered
at the United Nations.

766
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:37,030
In this, mankind's darkest hour...

767
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,430
the human race has turned, as one...

768
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,440
to the wisdom and leadership

769
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,030
of the President
of the United States.

770
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,050
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

771
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,080
Go get 'em, tiger.

772
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,140
They mean you, sir.

773
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,010
Oh, yes, of course.

774
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:07,230
So... an Indian, a Frenchman
and the Pope are all on a plane.

775
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,200
The pilot says,
"Hey, are any of you not circumcised?"

776
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:14,200
So the Pope lifts up
his robe and says...

777
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,970
"Shut up, stupid.
You don't even speak English."

778
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,910
The Israeli asked the Japanese guy
to open his eyes...

779
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,410
but the Japanese man says,
"I'm not squinting, you crazy Jew.

780
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,850
You're the one who sold me
these cheap glasses."

781
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,580
What's the difference between
a Belgian and a lump of dog shit?

782
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:33,220
The Belgian drinks wine,
but the dog shit smells good.

783
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:41,530
But, on a serious note,
I'm here today at the, uh...

784
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,100
"un"...because the Earth
has been attacked.

785
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,040
I'm happy to report that we may
have found a way to fight back.

786
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,600
My military advisers
at the Pentagram

787
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,440
have managed
to do the impossible.

788
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:56,170
They have captured one
of the alien heat ray guns.

789
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:00,510
As you know, the heat ray destroys the body,
leaving behind nothing but clothes.

790
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,750
Our engineers have managed to reverse
the polarity of the weapon

791
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,120
in the hopes that it can now
be turned against

792
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,250
the alien invaders.

793
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,560
Well, where was I?

794
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:19,800
Ah, yes. We expect that the
alien shields will be vulnerable

795
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,360
to this reconfigured weapon.

796
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,710
People, please! Please!

797
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:33,120
Please, people. Now, I know that this
new technology may seem frightening...

798
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,620
but I believe that deep down
inside this heat cannon

799
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,120
is our best chance.

800
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,620
Let me give you a demonstration.

801
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,390
Now let's see if this thing
is plugged in.

802
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,130
Uh... it's not a very pretty sight.

803
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,460
Everything's loose
and flapping around.

804
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,500
Look at this little pink thing.

805
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:02,600
Someone get some lubricant,
and we'll slather it around in here.

806
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,010
There.

807
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,860
Harper. Good God,
these people are all naked.

808
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:24,300
Have you no shame?
Have you no decency?

809
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,630
- Sir, you're naked, too.
- I am?

810
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,370
- I thought this was a wrinkly leather coat.
- Sir!

811
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,030
- These aren't buttons?
- No!

812
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,440
I've been pulling this thing
up and down like a zipper.

813
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,170
Mr. President, please.

814
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,680
There goes that duck again.

815
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,690
Yo, man, you see this red weed?

816
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,750
Nope.

817
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,760
Dad, how much further till Mom's?

818
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,660
I don't know.

819
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:54,320
I'm not sure how much longer
I can carry your sister.

820
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,700
I've been walking
this entire time.

821
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:00,360
- Then who the hell is-
- I'll pay you.

822
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,030
Stay close, Rachel.

823
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:06,540
Dad, look!

824
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:09,410
Hey! Hey! You guys!
I want to help!

825
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,420
Robbie! Oh, no.

826
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,420
Don't move. For God's sake,
stay right there. I'll be right back!

827
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,480
Hey! Hey, you guys!
I want to help.

828
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:23,660
Awesome!

829
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:26,320
- Wait!
- Are you crazy?

830
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,520
No!
They'll pay for half my college.

831
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:31,800
Kick ass.

832
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,700
Robbie!

833
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,710
- Yes!
- What's the matter with you?

834
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:39,040
Hey, look at that guy.
This is so cool!

835
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:44,840
Robbie! Robbie!

836
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,850
Rachel! Rachel!

837
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,220
Little girl, are you alone?

838
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:57,350
You need to come with me.

839
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:59,420
I'll keep you safe, right, kids?

840
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,930
Uh-uh.

841
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,060
- Do you have a little brother?
- Get away from her!

842
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,200
Run away, kids!

843
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,740
Toward the tripod,
if you have to!

844
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,140
Don't go! I've got a Ferris wheel
and a chimp...

845
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,650
and a big, soft bed
we can all get in.

846
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,580
No, please!

847
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,950
Not my real face!

848
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,890
Not my real face!

849
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,980
No!

850
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:35,220
Over here.

851
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,390
Follow me to safety.

852
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:41,600
- Ow!
- Follow me to safety.

853
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,610
- I don't know about this.
- I'm an excellent judge of character.

854
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,170
All right. Yeah.

855
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,270
That's it.

856
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,570
Oh, Brenda.

857
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,010
Yes! You did it!

858
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,780
You have learned quickly
and produced splendid butter.

859
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:27,320
Are you sure you have not
churned before?

860
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,880
Well, we don't call it churning
where I come from.

861
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,390
Pee-pee vagina.

862
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,510
Quick! Into the cellar.

863
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:58,110
No!

864
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,210
This is the cellar.
That's the cesspool.

865
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,880
Damn it!

866
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,750
Quick!

867
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,110
Boogedy-boogedy-boogedy.

868
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,340
Boogedy-boogedy-boogedy-boogedy.

869
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,250
Hey! You're not monsters.

870
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,080
Old Lady Henderson?

871
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,560
And Pig-Face Joe!

872
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,630
What happened?

873
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,190
It is Henry.

874
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,830
He has suffered a heart attack

875
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,900
brought on by this knife.

876
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,240
Who did this?

877
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:00,240
It was... Ezekiel.

878
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,070
Henry, you need a hospital.

879
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:06,640
It's not too late.
We can help you.

880
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,850
Perhaps you could start by
not leaning on the knife.

881
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,620
Do not be concerned for him,
Cindy.

882
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:18,150
We have sent our most qualified
villager for medicines.

883
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,230
I am so dead.

884
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,910
Please, leave me alone
with Cindy and Brenda.

885
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,570
I have much to tell them.

886
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,010
Listen carefully to me.

887
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,080
I am not long for this world.

888
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,120
- Pussy.
- Brenda!

889
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:50,990
What? 50 Cent got shot nine times.
He's still walking around.

890
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,120
Tell me, Henry, who killed the boy?
Was it you?

891
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,030
No, I loved him and his mother
very much.

892
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,090
I should have been with him
when he died.

893
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,440
It was horrible.

894
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:04,530
What happened?
You must tell me.

895
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:06,770
They went to a boxing match.

896
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,280
It was a women's
championship title fight.

897
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,580
And there was
a terrible accident.

898
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,810
Oh, my God.

899
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,630
Only in America!

900
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:36,030
All this time, I've been
searching for his killer

901
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:38,080
when it was me, Brenda.

902
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,080
It was all my fault.

903
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,870
Henry, your son told me
that if I found his killer...

904
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:44,920
I would know how
to defeat the aliens.

905
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,920
And he was right.
Don't you see?

906
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:51,110
All you have to do is-

907
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,520
Who the hell
let his ass out of jail?

908
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:58,360
His brother, the sheriff.

909
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:04,700
Fuckin' "A."

910
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,840
There you go, sweetie.

911
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:13,840
We're gonna die, aren't we?

912
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:18,040
Hey, nothing's gonna happen to you.
I haven't lost anyone yet.

913
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,570
- You've lost Robbie.
- Except Robbie.

914
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:26,060
None of that matters right now.
What's important is that I'm here with you.

915
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,060
Try and get some sleep, okay?

916
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,390
Sing me
"Lullaby and Good Night"?

917
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,530
I don't know that one.

918
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,130
Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?

919
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,260
I'm sorry, Rachel,
I don't that one, either.

920
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,440
Hey. Come on in.

921
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:22,100
Have a seat.

922
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,170
- The name's Oliver.
- Tom Ryan.

923
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,880
I found this place.
Plenty of food-

924
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,720
Along with two freshly killed
busybodies upstairs...

925
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:36,990
who "owned" the place.
We could stay here forever.

926
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:39,830
- Are you afraid?
- Of course I'm afraid.

927
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,060
I'm not.
I've been around death plenty.

928
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:44,620
I used to drive an ambulance
in the city...

929
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:48,300
but, apparently, I wasn't
a very strong driver.

930
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:50,700
It seems I was killing more people
than I was saving.

931
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,470
Something about that siren
got me excited.

932
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:57,110
Wham! Carnage.

933
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,620
But this is different.
This is a war.

934
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,980
No, it's an extermination.

935
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,820
It's no more of a war than there's a war
between men and maggots...

936
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:07,220
or dragons and wolves...

937
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:11,420
or men riding dragons,
throwing wolves at maggots.

938
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,190
Damn it, Tom. Can't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

939
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,760
These aliens must have a weakness.

940
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,240
I heard that the Japs killed
a few of 'em over in Kikkoman.

941
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,140
Kikkoman.
That's-That's soy sauce.

942
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,970
Right, yeah. Low sodium.

943
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,210
What I'm trying to say, Tom, is that you
and I should be fighting these things.

944
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,680
It's us that should be coming up
from under the ground.

945
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,810
Of course, we'll have to
bury ourselves first...

946
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,210
but it'll be worth it.

947
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:36,410
Cool breeze. No sunblock. Worms.

948
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:39,480
When we build our own tripods,
they'll have four legs.

949
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,530
I gotta show ya something.

950
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,890
We'll tunnel up from behind
and scare the piss out of ‘em.

951
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,390
Wish we had some shovels,
don't you?

952
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,810
Dad.

953
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,390
Daddy!

954
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:17,080
Rachel!

955
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:23,460
Rachel! Rachel!

956
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,740
What's the secret, Brenda?
What am I missing?

957
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,910
Oh, please!
More fake monsters?

958
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:52,450
Cindy!

959
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,440
Help! Help!

960
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:15,800
I promised I'd find you, didn't I?

961
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:32,390
Where are we?
What is this?

962
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,520
Some kind of basket
attached to the tripod.

963
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,260
Jesus!

964
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:40,240
I know, it's horrible.
But why?

965
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,140
What are the aliens
gonna do to us?

966
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,140
I don't know,
but they're taking everyone-

967
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:46,900
young, old, rich, poor, Chingy.

968
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:00,180
- Daddy!
- Rachel!

969
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:03,660
- No!
- Daddy! Help!

970
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:05,630
Tom!

971
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:18,130
Am I dead?

972
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,300
You're not dead.

973
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,450
- Brenda!
- Cindy!

974
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,320
Hey... could be worse.

975
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:41,390
- You want to switch?
- Okay.

976
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,370
Brenda, look!

977
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,030
I don't believe it!
The aliens killed a dinosaur!

978
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:56,310
Hello, humans.
Welcome to the inside of the command tripod.

979
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:59,580
Where's Rachel? What have
you done with my daughter?

980
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:03,520
All in good time, Tom.
But first, I want to play a game.

981
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:07,390
The devices you wear
will trigger in 60 seconds.

982
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:11,920
The switch on the wall
behind Cindy will disable them.

983
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,860
But where is the key?

984
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:15,520
I'll give you a hint, Cindy.

985
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:18,700
Let the game begin.

986
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:22,500
I... I don't get it.

987
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:27,200
Okay...
maybe this will help you "see."

988
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:37,750
You want me to... cut something?

989
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:41,090
That should be obvious, yes.

990
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,590
No.

991
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:49,760
No!
The key is behind your eye, okay?

992
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:59,110
Zoltar, get in here!
This one's gonna do it!

993
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,410
Fake eye.

994
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,810
Bad bar fight in '96.

995
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:14,060
Oh.

996
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:20,160
Oh... oh, I hope this doesn't
come between us.

997
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:22,220
Of course not.

998
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,630
Is it too late
for me to try this on?

999
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:33,570
Silence!
The game is not yet over.

1000
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,740
- Rachel!
- Daddy!

1001
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,250
- Robbie!
Daddy!

1002
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:48,420
The only thing keeping
your children alive, Tom, is you.

1003
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:50,980
Well, we had a good run.

1004
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,330
Ha! You weren't expecting that,
were you?

1005
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,340
On the contrary,
I was counting on it.

1006
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:08,810
I call it..."the nutcracker."

1007
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,810
Why?

1008
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,610
Of course.

1009
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:24,450
Tempura. Sushi. Sashimi!

1010
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,660
Oh, my- Oh, my gosh.

1011
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:34,330
Of course. Follow the blood.
Henry was his stepdad.

1012
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,900
You're the little boy's real father!

1013
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,870
Where did you even meet her?

1014
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:41,410
It was spring break in Cabo. So what?

1015
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,810
I blended in.
Seriously, who gives a crap?

1016
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,210
What's this?

1017
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,650
Enjoy your purple nurple, Tom.

1018
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,020
Please, your son
wouldn't want this.

1019
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:57,890
His soul walks the Earth because
of the pain you've caused him.

1020
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,590
No. I have crossed a galaxy
for revenge.

1021
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:02,860
But it's my fault.
Let the others go.

1022
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:06,100
Oh, I don't think so.
Look upon him as he writhes!

1023
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:09,570
Hey, Cindy!
Look, I'm on TV, y'all! Check it out!

1024
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,730
I'm gonna give a shout out
to all my peeps!

1025
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:15,870
Have you lost your mind?

1026
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:18,380
No one... bitch slaps... Brenda!

1027
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:20,610
Zoltar, help!

1028
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:24,120
Oh, oh!
This is some bullshit!

1029
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,560
I know you hold a grudge against humanity
for your son's death, but-

1030
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,960
Oh, wet willy!

1031
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:33,260
Killing us won't bring
your little boy back.

1032
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,230
No. You will all pay
for what you have done.

1033
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,390
Besides,
I've already built this thing.

1034
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,900
When the trap closes on you,
it will lock the chain in place.

1035
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,960
Your children will be saved...

1036
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,640
but you will suffer a terrible death.

1037
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:50,370
Can you hang on
to the ones you love?

1038
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,570
You have 60 seconds.

1039
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:57,810
- No.
- Don't worry, kids. I won't quit on you.

1040
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,290
It's okay to let go, Dad.

1041
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,920
All you ever had to do
was show that you loved me.

1042
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,460
And show me what it means
to be a man.

1043
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:10,060
And show me
that I could love again.

1044
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,960
We forgive you, Dad.

1045
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,150
The spikes- they stopped!

1046
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,190
- Kids!
- Daddy!

1047
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:39,500
Are you... sparing our lives?

1048
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,500
Anyone can hold a grudge...

1049
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,860
but it takes real courage to forgive.

1050
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:47,870
- The invasion is over.
- And?

1051
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:51,000
And I guess I'm sorry or something.
I don't know.

1052
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:52,700
Like you mean it.

1053
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,710
Okay.

1054
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:57,370
I'm sorry for killing millions of people.
Whatever!

1055
01:15:57,450 --> 01:16:00,110
Wait... where's Brenda?

1056
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,350
What?

1057
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:06,820
We're at peace now.
I was just sealing the deal.

1058
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:11,420
Come on, Brenda. Let's go.

1059
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,400
Bye, Zoltar!
Don't lose my number!

1060
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,490
Tell me you didn't catch something.

1061
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:22,470
Nah, it's cool.
She said she was a virgin.

1062
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,040
We are so fucked.

1063
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,190
Mommy!

1064
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:50,360
Thank you.

1065
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,500
Hey, look, kids- Grandpa.

1066
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,200
No, that's my new husband.

1067
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:09,610
Oh, I think it's romantic-
the way love can find anyone.

1068
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,980
And so, love triumphed in the end...

1069
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:19,360
and the invaders were destroyed.

1070
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:22,160
For this world, our world...

1071
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:24,200
is the world of man.

1072
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:27,290
We have earned the right
to live here...

1073
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:31,740
and as long as we love,
humanity will prevail.

1074
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:35,640
Each of our enemies has failed
in their quest to defeat us...

1075
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:40,450
each has been undone
by their own nefarious plans.

1076
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,980
Among all worlds,
across all galaxies...

1077
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:47,720
we stand above, we stand alone.

1078
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:52,420
None can threaten our existence,
none can challenge our spirit.

1079
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,430
And why?

1080
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,800
Of all the qualities
that make us unique...

1081
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:00,530
it is love that is
our greatest strength...

1082
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,230
and because of love, mankind-

1083
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,510
Thank you.
Hello, and welcome to the show.

1084
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:14,350
We have got a very special man
with some very special news.

1085
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:17,650
That's right- he's in the building!
The man who saved the world!

1086
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,990
Put your hands together
for Tom Ryan!

1087
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:25,650
- Yes!
- My best friend.

1088
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,870
Whoo!

1089
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:44,310
- Wow.
- That's it?

1090
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,080
Okay.

1091
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:53,650
- So, you're in love.
- I am. I'm in love.

1092
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,200
He's lost it.
The boy's lost it.

1093
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,890
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1094
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:12,130
- You are adorable when you are in love.
- Thank you.

1095
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:15,510
- Tell us all about her.
- She's great. She's really terrific.

1096
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:17,240
So it's complicated.

1097
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,580
Yeah, you were saying
that-that she's complex, I guess.

1098
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:21,480
