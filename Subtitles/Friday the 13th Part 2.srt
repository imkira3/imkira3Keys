00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:28,861
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i>
<i>Crawled up the waterspout</i>

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:35,701
<i>Down came the rain</i>
<i>And washed the spider out</i>

4
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:40,706
<i>Out came the sun</i>
<i>And dried up all the rain</i>

5
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,169
<i>And the itsy-bitsy spider</i>
<i>Crawled up the spout again</i>

6
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,547
Jesse, you get in this house right now!

7
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,007
Oh, Mom.

8
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,467
Right now.

9
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,803
No!

10
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,027
Who are you?

11
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,614
Well, I'm Mrs Voorhees,
an old friend of the Christys.

12
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,911
No, no. They're all dead.
They're all dead.

13
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,454
All right, I'll go look.

14
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,958
Please don't leave me.
He'll kill you too!

15
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,668
I'm not afraid.

16
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,715
No!

17
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,305
Did you know
that a young boy drowned

18
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,724
the year before
those two others were killed?

19
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,477
The counsellors
weren't paying any attention.

20
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,856
They were making love
while that young boy drowned.

21
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,484
His name was Jason.

22
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,365
I was working the day that
it happened. Preparing meals.

23
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,951
Here. I was the cook.

24
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,371
Jason should have been
watched, every minute!

25
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,581
He was...

26
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,336
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

27
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,924
We can go now, dear.

28
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,887
No!

29
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,560
My sweet, innocent Jason.

30
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,606
My only child.

31
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,982
Jason.

32
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:21,491
You let him drown.
You never paid any attention!

33
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,369
Look what you did to him.

34
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,457
Look what you did to him!

35
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,219
No!

36
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,313
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

37
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,400
She can't hide.
No place to hide.

38
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:59,112
Get her, Mommy. Get her.

39
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,989
Kill her. Kill her.

40
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,306
Two of my men pulled you out
of the lake. We...

41
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,766
...thought you were dead too.

42
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,228
Do you remember very much?

43
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,231
The boy. Is he dead too?

44
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,902
- Who?
- The boy. Jason.

45
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,365
- Jason?
- In the lake.

46
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,200
The one who attacked me.
The one who

47
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,786
pulled me
underneath the water.

48
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,290
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

49
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,629
Then he's still there.

50
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,772
God!

51
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,587
Hello?

52
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,297
Hi, Mom.

53
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,883
I know. I'm sorry.

54
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,845
I meant to call earlier, but I fell asleep.

55
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,349
Really, I'm fine.

56
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,645
I need a little time alone, that's all.

57
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,320
I know you and Dad worry,
and I appreciate that.

58
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,035
Come on, Mom,
we've been through all of this before.

59
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:40,083
I just have to put my life back together,
and this is the only way I know how.

60
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,631
Look...

61
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:51,094
Mom, please. It's getting late,
and I really don't want to get into it.

62
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,473
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

63
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,805
Mom!

64
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,558
Hello?

65
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,566
Cute.

66
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,695
You want something to eat?

67
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,088
All right, keep your eyes peeled.
I think we're getting close.

68
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,762
Hey, there's a gas station.

69
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,697
Okay, let's call Ted.

70
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,214
Hey, Teddy, buddy!

71
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,259
We just rolled in.
Yeah, yeah, Sandra's here.

72
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,927
Hi, Ted!

73
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,346
Hey, so you gonna come down
and get us or what?

74
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,724
Yeah, okay.
Okay, give me the directions.

75
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:57,061
Here, wait, wait, wait. All right.
Okay, go ahead, I'm ready.

76
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:01,566
All right, Old North Road,
and then look for a Dairy Queen?

77
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,610
Okay. And then over...

78
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,988
I told the others.
They didn't believe me.

79
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:12,035
You're all doomed.

80
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,086
What? Oh, no, nothing.

81
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,339
No, go ahead. No. All right.

82
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,175
So... All right, covered bridge.

83
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,261
Okay. Then what?

84
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,307
All right, so, then past an old cemetery.
All right.

85
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,267
And then...

86
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,687
Left down an old dirt road
for half a mile.

87
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,440
Oh, my God! They're towing us!

88
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,776
Shit! Ted, I'll call you back.

89
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,487
- Hey, wait!
- Hey, mister!

90
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,744
This is my truck! Come on!
This is my truck!

91
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,122
Asshole, this is my truck!

92
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,710
Shit!

93
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,725
Welcome to God's country.

94
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,687
You rat shit!

95
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,444
Thanks, Max!
Max owns the gas station.

96
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,781
- He's crazy too.
- I should have known.

97
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,242
It's great to see you.
It'll be like old times.

98
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,286
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

99
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,913
Help me load my gear and we'll split.

100
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,795
So, Ted, what's the scoop?

101
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,174
I know that guy Paul
that's running the course. He's okay.

102
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,176
He's kind of macho, though.

103
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,221
He takes the whole thing very seriously.

104
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,349
Senior camp counsellor, of course.

105
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,019
We'll probably all get
a Brownie badge ifwe survive.

106
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,229
- lf we survive?
- That's right.

107
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,732
Didn't I tell you you're gonna be
a second assistant?

108
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,608
Oh, no!

109
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,028
Wait, listen, listen.

110
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,031
A bear and a rabbit are in the woods.
Both are taking a dump.

111
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,866
The bear looks down
at the rabbit and says,

112
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,286
"Excuse me, Mr Rabbit,
does shit stick to your fur?"

113
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,872
The rabbit says, "No, Mr. Bear."

114
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,791
So the bear wiped his ass
with the rabbit.

115
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,671
What the heck is that?

116
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:43,019
- Where did this sucker come from?
- I don't know. Let's move it.

117
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,566
This place is spooky.

118
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,570
It looks like somebody dragged it here.

119
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,405
Yeah, but what for?

120
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,213
Hey, you guys, look at this.

121
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,598
It's Camp Blood. This place is
on the same lake as we're gonna be.

122
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,475
- Camp Blood?
- Isn't that the place...

123
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,727
- Let's get out of here.
- Can't we take a look?

124
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,646
- No way.
- What's the problem?

125
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,775
You don't wanna hear about it, man.
Believe me. Not before lunch.

126
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,829
Need some help?

127
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,957
No, it's okay. I got it. Thanks, anyhow.

128
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,874
Okay, let's settle down.

129
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,085
It's great to have you here
at our new counsellor training centre.

130
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,464
You've all worked as counsellors
at one camp or another.

131
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,883
Terry, Vickie,
you were upstate last summer, right?

132
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,303
Scott! Hi! Good to see you here, buddy.
You need it.

133
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,099
And, Mark, I know we worked
a season or two together, right?

134
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,186
Okay. The rest of you
I'm sure I'll get to know soon enough.

135
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,897
I'm also sure there's one thing
I don't have to tell you.

136
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,442
Being a counsellor isn't the gravy
summer job everybody thinks it is.

137
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,590
And what we're gonna do
over the next two weeks,

138
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:04,595
if the rest of my staff ever shows up,
is go back to basics.

139
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,976
Survival, first aid, boating,
archery, rifle range, all of it.

140
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,398
What the hell...

141
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,364
I'll be right back.

142
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,703
Hi! I'm late.

143
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,265
What is this crap?
You're supposed to be my assistant.

144
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,893
- Everyone else got here hours ago.
- I said I was sorry.

145
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,228
You did?

146
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,816
I'm sorry. Okay?

147
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,319
- But my car's sick.
- You could have called.

148
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,905
Paul, I tried, but your phones
aren't even working yet.

149
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:10,911
Okay, get your gear stowed
and help me outside, okay?

150
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,415
Paul, look,
the course starts today, right?

151
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,459
Well, here I am.

152
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:21,547
And I promise you, I'll never, ever
be late again in my entire life.

153
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,425
Is it a deal?

154
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,762
All right, all right, what the hell.

155
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,268
Ginny, I was starting to worry about you.

156
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,021
Bullshit, Paul.

157
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,999
Ginny, put your car on the lot, okay?

158
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,710
This place looks like a Burger King.

159
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,379
Where was I?

160
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,840
You were about to give your
"Let's keep our shit together" speech.

161
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,217
Mr Holt.

162
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,387
Right, Ted. Right.

163
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,889
Okay, look, a few words about safety.

164
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,726
Axes, knives, lanterns, saws.
They can all be trouble.

165
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,771
Their misuse is the main cause
of camp accidents.

166
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,565
Take care of your equipment,
and it'll take care of you.

167
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,778
Now, a word of caution
about our friends in the forest.

168
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,948
Among other things,
this is bear country.

169
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,410
And contrary to what everybody hears,
bears are dangerous.

170
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,329
That means no food fights.

171
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,290
Change often.
Food odours cling to clothing.

172
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,752
If you're a woman, don't use perfume.

173
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,713
And keep clean
during your menstrual cycle.

174
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,179
Having trouble?
You gotta treat them gentle.

175
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,639
Just like kids.

176
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:57,351
Use a little of that child psychology
you're majoring in.

177
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,689
Try it.

178
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,328
It's more fun using
that child psychology on you.

179
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,539
You're such a sucker for it.

180
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,212
- Thanks much.
- I don't want to scare anyone,

181
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,217
but I'm gonna give it
to you straight about Jason.

182
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:35,389
His body was never recovered
from the lake after he drowned.

183
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,811
If you listen to the old-timers,
they'll tell you he's still out there.

184
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:46,150
Some sort of demented creature,
surviving in the wilderness.

185
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,943
Full-grown by now.

186
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,404
Stalking.

187
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,868
Stealing what he needs,
living offwild animals and vegetation.

188
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:02,166
Some folks claim they've even
seen him, right in this area.

189
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:09,006
The girl who survived that night
at Camp Blood, that Friday the 13th,

190
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,676
she claims she saw him.

191
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,931
She disappeared two months later.

192
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,433
Vanished.

193
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,937
Blood was everywhere.

194
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,358
No one knows what happened to her.

195
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,740
Legend has it that Jason saw
his mother beheaded that night,

196
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,743
and he took his revenge.

197
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,958
A revenge that he'll continue to seek
if anyone enters his wilderness again.

198
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:52,800
And by now, I guess you all know,
we're the first to return here.

199
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,933
Five years.
Five long years, he's been dormant.

200
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,770
And he's hungry.

201
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,357
Jason's out there

202
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,777
watching.

203
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,656
Always on the prowl for intruders.

204
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,409
Waiting to kill.

205
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,078
Waiting to devour.

206
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,833
Thirsty for young blood.

207
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,757
Hey, come back! Come back!

208
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,433
Okay, look, now that we've got that
out of our system,

209
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,310
I don't want to hear any more about it.

210
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,605
It's ancient history. Jason drowned,
Mrs Voorhees was killed,

211
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,275
and Camp Crystal Lake is off-limits.
You got it?

212
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,361
Got you, huh? What did you think?

213
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,948
The second act needs work.

214
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,713
- Too bad.
- Come on.

215
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,886
You got him. You got him.
You got him now.

216
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,721
Go on.

217
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:27,895
- That's luck. That's luck, all right?
- Thanks a lot.

218
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,104
Next.

219
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,401
- Hi, Terry. Do you wanna dance?
- No, thank you.

220
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,905
Hi there. How about you?
Do you wanna dance?

221
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:51,335
So there I was, sitting in this
fast-food joint, thinking to myself,

222
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,964
"Scott, old boy, what are you gonna do
with the rest of your life?"

223
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,935
I'm striking out all over the place.

224
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,479
Well, I think I've got you. Check.

225
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,982
Wrong, white man.

226
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,361
Checkmate.

227
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,949
Well, what next?

228
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,410
I could get my arm broken by Mark,

229
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,746
my brains Ponged
by our electronical wizard

230
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,958
or bed.

231
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,462
Good night, Paul.
See you in the morning.

232
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,865
Jeff, I just gotta see that place.

233
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,243
- What place?
- That camp. Camp Blood.

234
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,412
- You're crazy.
- I've just got to.

235
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,540
Maybe there is something
to that legend. I'm serious.

236
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,126
No way.
You're not getting me out there.

237
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,463
- Besides, Paul said it was off-limits.
- We'll see.

238
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,063
Hello?

239
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,651
Who's there?

240
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,998
- Paul, God damn it! What do you...
- Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

241
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,084
You'll wake the natives.

242
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,921
I'm not supposed to be fraternizing
with the staff.

243
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,886
I won't tell.

244
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,612
I missed you, Ginny.

245
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,033
And I really was worried
when you didn't show on time.

246
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,309
Oh, Paul, there's something
I think I should tell you.

247
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,275
Come on! Come on!

248
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,778
What's the matter, guys?
Jeff, the women are showing you up.

249
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,030
What's the matter with you?

250
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,866
Hey!

251
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,012
We've got about a half a mile,
then we're gonna have lunch.

252
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,933
Try to stay on this trail, because
there's a lot of poison ivy along here.

253
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:01,895
- How far are we from camp?
- Hey, you guys, don't trip on that.

254
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,192
Mr Holt.
What are we gonna have for lunch?

255
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,361
Ted's probably gonna cook.

256
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:16,243
All right, after lunch,
we're gonna do some more running.

257
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,496
- Here you go, Ted.
- Thank you, dear.

258
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,379
- Come and get them!
- I'm here.

259
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:19,556
Muffin? Here, girl. Muffin.

260
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,145
Muffin?

261
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,314
Terry, lunch!

262
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,066
Okay. I'm coming!

263
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,765
<i>- Jeff.</i>
- What?

264
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,974
You ready?

265
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,976
- For what?
- Camp Blood.

266
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,771
I thought we weren't supposed
to go near that place.

267
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:11,108
Come on, it's only a short walk.
They'll never know we're gone.

268
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,944
Jeff, I'm serious. I really wanna see it.

269
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:18,115
Look, when we get back to the city,
we can tell everyone we were there.

270
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,450
Oh, come on, you chicken shit.

271
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,550
Okay, let's go.

272
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,583
Okay, you guys. I got one. Ready?

273
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:13,003
What's green and red
and moves 100 miles an hour?

274
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,589
- What?
- A frog in a blender.

275
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,716
Ha-ha. That wasn't funny.

276
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,053
- What's brown and sits on a piano?
- Your face.

277
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,222
Beethoven's last movement.

278
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,266
God.

279
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,056
- This must be it.
- Yeah.

280
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,057
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

281
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,934
It looks like a dog.

282
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,272
- It's too mangled to tell.
- What do you think did it?

283
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,190
Wild animal, I guess.

284
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,945
What are you kids doing out here?

285
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,787
You're gonna have to keep your people
away from that place. It's condemned.

286
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,623
Next time I catch anybody there,
I'll run them in.

287
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,376
- He told us...
- I'll handle this, Jeff.

288
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,589
- I might just get a warrant against you.
- Oh, really?

289
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:29,973
Look, Holt, people say what you're doing
with these kids is great.

290
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,600
You've got a good reputation.

291
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,645
But if I was you,
I'd have located in the next county.

292
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,647
You're too close.

293
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,692
Things have been quiet for five years.
That's the way we want it.

294
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,194
So do I, Officer. So do I.

295
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,948
Okay, you two, take off,
and I'll talk to you at dinner.

296
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,285
- We'll never do it again, sir.
- Thanks, Mr Holt.

297
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,498
You're not even gonna reprimand them?

298
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,626
No punishment?
What kind of place is this?

299
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,337
- Ginny?
- Yes, Paul?

300
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,631
No seconds on dessert
for Jeff and Sandra tonight.

301
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,721
You okay?

302
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,559
Should we tell Terry?
You know, about what we saw?

303
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,146
No way. As far as I'm concerned,
we didn't see a thing.

304
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,216
Hey! Hey, you!

305
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,140
Oh, my God.

306
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,023
- Oh, no.
- Anybody want...

307
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,858
Who made this shit?

308
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,904
Okay, people.

309
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,323
Today was fun and games, right?

310
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,576
I like to start you out slow, ease you in.

311
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,161
Tomorrow, we'll get serious.

312
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:06,583
Anybody who wants a last night
on the town, now's your chance.

313
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,419
Okay, who else?
We only have two cars.

314
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,671
By the way, our wanderers
have volunteered to stay

315
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,133
and watch the camp.
Isn't that nice of them?

316
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,635
I think I'll stay too. Muffin may show.

317
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,722
Well, I'm gonna go change, you guys.

318
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:24,475
You know, I'm pretty tired.
I think I'll stick around too.

319
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,644
- Get me another cup of coffee?
- Sure.

320
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,397
- Don't drink too much.
- Bye-bye.

321
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,442
Hey, you staying?

322
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:36,195
Yeah. Nothing spoils a party faster
than a drunk in a wheelchair.

323
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,532
That's crap.
Look, we can go together if you want.

324
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,119
I appreciate that, but I'm in training.

325
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,872
- Then I'm staying too.
- Suit yourself.

326
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,335
So how about it, second-in-command?
You coming?

327
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,586
- You buying?
- Sure.

328
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,922
- You got a deal.
- Got the keys?

329
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,719
Beer time!

330
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:04,140
Take it easy. Have fun.
I'll have a Jack for you.

331
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:08,102
- See you later!
- Bring back my truck in one piece.

332
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,773
- I'm going for a walk.
- We'll wait up for you, all right?

333
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,574
Go, scooter.

334
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,183
Now I know how you can afford
tuition to grad school.

335
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:51,104
You always find some fool
to fix your car and buy you a beer.

336
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,481
You got it.

337
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,806
Muffin?

338
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,355
- Here we are!
- All right.

339
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:47,201
Everybody, get out for some beers!
All right!

340
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,549
Come on, Mark.

341
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,593
Come on.

342
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,391
You're gonna lose. All right!

343
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,352
- Hey!
- Cheater.

344
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,563
- Okay, okay, okay. Two out of three.
- All right.

345
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,777
Jeff, don't wear yourself out.

346
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,238
You wanna wrestle, come with me.

347
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,075
Later, scooter.

348
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,993
Wanna take me on?

349
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,787
Sure. Have a seat.

350
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,170
- I only want your fingers.
- What?

351
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,841
Take your pick.

352
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,385
They're Ted's. It's okay with him.

353
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,346
Football and hockey.

354
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,599
- Which one do you prefer?
- The one with the puck.

355
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,812
- You mean hockey?
- Is that what you call it?

356
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,940
Okay. What do you wanna play for?

357
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,484
Position.

358
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,910
Looking for something?

359
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,383
- Come and get it.
- Give me my shirt, Scott.

360
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,056
If I get my hands on you...

361
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,349
Scott!

362
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,854
It's no longer funny, Scott.

363
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:07,568
Help! God damn that Paul!
Him and his wilderness bullshit!

364
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,113
- What can I do?
- Get me down, that's what!

365
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:15,034
- I'll have to get a knife to cut the rope.
- Well, hurry, okay?

366
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,457
I ought to let you hang, you pervert.

367
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,834
Come on, Ter. Give me a break.

368
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,005
- You gonna cut the crap?
- Sure, anything. I promise.

369
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,715
Okay.

370
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,803
Don't go anywhere.

371
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,057
Very funny.

372
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,861
Where is she?

373
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,733
Scott, I'm gonna cut you down.

374
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:14,820
But I swear, if you ever do this to me
again, I'm gonna kill you.

375
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,448
Scott?

376
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,872
Look at this.

377
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,416
I think I'm in love.

378
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,169
No, no, it's just tremendous affection.

379
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,591
Are you sure you don't
want me to clear those?

380
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,302
- No, I'm collecting these.
- Have it your way, honey.

381
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,097
I just don't want the bar
to fall down on you.

382
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,390
Thanks.

383
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,185
- I think she likes you.
- I think so too.

384
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,356
This whole thing's ridiculous, really.

385
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,152
Two of our kids got hauled in today,
because five years ago

386
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:40,698
some girl panics and falls out
of a canoe. It's absurd.

387
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,452
- What if there is a Jason?
- Oh, bullshit, Ginny.

388
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,371
No, what if there is
some kind of boy-beast

389
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,582
running around Camp Crystal Lake?

390
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,294
Let's try to think beyond the legend.
Put it in real terms.

391
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,421
I mean, what would he be like today?

392
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,549
Some kind of
out-of-control psychopath?

393
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:02,970
A frightened retard?
A child trapped in a man's body?

394
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,430
Let me out!

395
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,977
- He'd be grown by now, right?
- Right.

396
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:14,398
And, you know, the only person
that ever knew him was his mother.

397
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:18,027
He never went to school,
so he never had any friends.

398
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,820
She was everything to him.

399
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,114
Yeah. Deranged killer.

400
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,745
No, no, no.
You're missing my whole point.

401
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:31,123
I mean, I doubt Jason would have
even known the meaning of death.

402
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,584
Or at least until that horrible night.

403
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,462
He must have seen
the whole thing happen.

404
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:41,383
He must have seen his mother killed,
and all just because she loved him.

405
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,677
Isn't that what her revenge
was all about?

406
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:48,390
Her sense of loss, her rage
at what she thought happened,

407
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,142
her love for him?

408
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,856
Bizarre, isn't it?

409
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:03,030
He must be out there right now,
crying for her return, her resurrection.

410
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,078
- Well, what do you think?
- I think you're drunk.

411
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:12,248
I'll drink to that.
Hit us again, sweetheart.

412
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,540
Not me.

413
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:22,049
You know, Paul,
I'm really serious about this though.

414
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,594
Jason's a legend, Ginny, a legend.

415
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,522
Your turn.
Three goals or you're gonna lose.

416
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,733
I've heard that one before.

417
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:25,696
Mark, what happened
that you have to be in a chair?

418
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,075
Motorcycle accident, paralysed my legs.

419
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,785
Is it permanent?

420
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,164
The doctor thinks so. I don't.

421
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,085
I don't intend to be in this thing
the rest of my life.

422
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,130
Just your legs, huh?
Is everything else okay?

423
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,218
Oh, I do all right, one way or another.

424
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,433
Toke?

425
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,602
I'm in training, remember?

426
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,687
For what?

427
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,487
What does the winner get?

428
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,824
- What does the winner want?
- Guess.

429
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,126
Want to stay together tonight?

430
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,253
I was just about to ask you.

431
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,004
My cabin or yours?

432
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,801
Ted's in mine.
I don't think that would work out.

433
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,595
We've got the whole camp.
We'll find our own cabin.

434
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,515
Just give me a few minutes
to get some things, okay?

435
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,809
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

436
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,655
Oh, damn it.

437
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,661
Terry, you turkey.

438
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,001
There you are.

439
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,441
Vickie?

440
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,741
Vickie, is that you?

441
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,682
Vickie?

442
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,391
I looked up "ugly" in the dictionary.

443
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,518
There's a picture of him.

444
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,606
- I got to get some sleep.
- I'm tired.

445
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:01,276
- You guys quitting already?
- Ted, you'd have me out till breakfast.

446
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,195
- I'm gonna ride with you, okay?
- Okay.

447
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,072
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night, Ginny.

448
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,742
When this place closes,
come straight back to camp.

449
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,119
- Yes, boss.
- And let Maggie drive the pickup.

450
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,537
Yes, boss.

451
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,043
Okay, let's make a run for it.

452
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,838
- Move it!
- I'm going! I'm going!

453
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,642
This thing had better start.

454
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,853
- You fixed it.
- I know, that's what worries me.

455
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,574
Are there any
after-hours places around here?

456
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,576
- Sure are.
- "Sure are."

457
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:12,389
Mark?

458
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,937
Mark, where are you?

459
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,617
Is anybody still here?

460
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,165
Sandra?

461
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,375
<i>Jeff?</i>

462
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,963
Sandra? Jeff?

463
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,555
Sandra.

464
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:58,685
Sandra?

465
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,024
Sandra.

466
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,778
No! No!

467
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,450
No!

468
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,204
No! Stop!

469
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,667
No! No!

470
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:05,210
Nice night.

471
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,962
Yeah, for a duck.

472
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,438
God.

473
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:29,818
What the hell are all the lights on for?

474
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:33,154
Paul, they wouldn't have
left the place like this.

475
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,785
Think something's wrong?

476
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,706
I'll check upstairs.

477
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:49,921
These kids smoke better dope
than I do.

478
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,131
Paul!

479
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,635
Yeah, Ginny, what...

480
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,181
What is this, a joke?

481
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,809
They wouldn't do anything like this.

482
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,940
Ginny, come on.

483
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,276
Wait for me.

484
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:19,868
Kitchen light's still on. Must...
Must be the main fuse again.

485
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:22,620
- Paul, what's going on here?
- Nothing.

486
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,377
Where is everybody?

487
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,962
I don't know.

488
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:35,717
The rain's stopping.
We'll go look for them.

489
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,693
Paul, there's someone in this room.

490
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,325
Paul, there's someone
in this fucking room!

491
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,707
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

492
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:16,341
Paul? Paul?

493
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,850
Paul?

494
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,602
Answer me!

495
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,516
God, please, keys, be there.
Keys, be there...

496
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,648
Come on, car! Come on, car!

497
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,817
Please start. Please start. Please start.

498
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,110
Start!

499
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:42,904
Oh, shit!

500
01:10:58,003 --> 01:16:30,960
Oh, my God!

501
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:32,628
Please help me.

502
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,844
Oh, God...

503
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,669
Jason! It's all done, Jason.

504
01:17:56,755 --> 01:18:00,132
You've done your job well,
and Mommy is pleased.

505
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:01,926
That's a good boy.

506
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:06,514
Now, come to Mommy. Come on.

507
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:11,185
Come on.

508
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,607
Mommy has a reward for you.

509
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:33,874
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

510
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,964
Come on.

511
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:42,842
That's my boy.

512
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:45,928
Come. Kneel down.

513
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:49,473
That's a boy.

514
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:52,977
Kneel down.

515
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,813
Kneel down, Jason.

516
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,817
That's my good boy.

517
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:07,199
That's a good boy.

518
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,202
Good Jason.

519
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:25,843
Ginny!

520
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,543
Come on. Let's go.

521
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:42,920
Ginny.

522
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:55,599
Jesus.

523
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:58,686
Come on.

524
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,131
Paul!

525
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:30,217
Come on. I'll carry you.

526
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,667
It's all right.

527
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:12,259
Hey, you're all right. You're all...

528
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:18,432
God! Oh, God!

529
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:22,186
No, you're okay. You're okay.

530
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,855
You're okay, Ginny. You're all right.

531
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:27,942
It's all right.

532
01:23:29,295 --> 01:23:31,046
Oh, Muffin!

533
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:34,967
Muffin.

534
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,351
Oh, Muffin.

535
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:49,940
Come here, Muffin.

536
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,935
Paul? Paul?

537
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,479
Where's Paul?

538
01:24:29,305 --> 01:25:29,855
