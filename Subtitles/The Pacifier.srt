for what happened
to the professor.

62
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,776
Plummer was the best
security expert

63

the Department of Defense
ever had.

64
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,743
He was working on a program to scramble
launch codes that he called "GHOST":

65

Guided High-altitude

and a country can't launch
its own nukes.

68
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,389
That's why the Serbians
kidnapped him.

69
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,921
They must have thought that
GHOST was in that briefcase.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,969
GHOST is still out there.

71

back in.

before, Shane.

327
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,497
You'll be happy to know that I found

Yeah, you just do
whatever you have to.

[Woman] Don't worry!

[Bells ringing]

Okay, everybody, listen up.
There's been a change of plans.

353
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,372
Your mother's not coming home
as soon as she expected.

I've got Fireflies.

I have to go to the mall.

Whoa, okay, Halt. Halt!

We'll take this hill

Did you ever punch someone
so hard that their head came off?

378

No.

379
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,961
Why are your boobs so big?

380
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,724
They're not boobs.

381
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,961
Do you have to wear a bra?

382
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,701
Will my boobs
get as big as yours someday?

383
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,113
You know, little girl,

384
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:50,951
I think it's time you went
nappy-poo in beddy-bye land.

385

Do I look like I'm five to you?

386
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,025
What did I say?

387
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,724
Disrespectful. And to think
I was interested in you!

Feel free to mix and match.

392
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,804
Stay away from the cheese.
It'll back you up.

393
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,008
Don't worry about running out.
I can get lots more of these.

394
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,142
I've survived months
off this stuff.

No, Mrs. Plummer's away.

Yes, we'll be right there.

409
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,989
Who was that?

410
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,295
Your vice principal.

411
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,835
He said that if you and Seth
are late again,

412
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,530
you're both suspended.

413

- How do we...?
- Excuse me, Mr. Wolfe?

419
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,389
If you don't hurry up,
we're gonna be late for sure.

420
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,448
Not on my watch.

422

My fault.

431
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:49,958
Yeah, I always said these kids
needed a parole officer.

432
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,095
I guess, uh, Mrs. Plummer
thought so too, huh?

433
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,605
Wow, you got a real, uh,
upper torso going on, huh?

No? Good.

Wow, it looks like you
have a pair of legs

coming out of your shoulders.

440

- You hit the gym a lot, do you?
- Eh.

- [Low] Woolly Mammoth.
- You know what, Creeper?

I'm Murney.

My friends call me
"Little Puppet. "

00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,420
I'm the VP here.

See the Creeper over there?

456
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,833
He has played hooky from every
wrestling practice this month.

457
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,935
And her, she has missed
22 Driver's Ed classes.

Out of 23!

459
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,947

- [Murney] Roger. Absolutely.

our new friend here

465

about some of the duties
as vice principal.

466
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,602
Speaking of which, how's it
going with the investigation

467
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,139
into the baloney slices
on the cafeteria ceiling?

468
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,335
- Taking some interesting turns.
- Keep up the good work.

469
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,641
Right. I'll be on the roof.

470
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,148
Bye, now.

471
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,514
All right, it's time
to get back to class.

472

Mrs. Plummer thought the kids...

aren't fully aware of the situation

482

you're a "Teams" guy.

- Commitment.

- I saw it when I was a kid.
- Really?

784
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:33,411
The idea of a nun ditching her
habit for a guy in the military.

785
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,884
Nothing wrong with that.

786
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:39,012
Do you think girls
will think I'm weird?

787
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,990
They probably already do, Seth.

788
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:44,322
But you'll kill 'em later.

789
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,624
Come here.

790
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:52,156
Forget about everyone else
for a second.

791
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,500
Is performing
what makes you happy?

792
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,040
Yeah,
more than anything.

793
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,135
All right, fall in.

794
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,977
Company. Center stage.

795
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:11,514
Company! Center stage!

796
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,455
Who is this guy?

797
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:19,894
Now, do you or do you not have
what it takes to perform this musical?

798
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,763
- We don't have a director.
- I've directed rescue missions

799
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,267
all around the world.

800
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,396
I've directed numerous
snatch-and-grabs

801
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:34,205
from countries whose names
you are not allowed to know.

802
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:38,976
I've choreographed
multi-pronged amphibious landings

803
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,574
and stealth air attacks!

804
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:46,782
Do you think I have
the military proficiency...

805
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:49,916
...to direct this production?

806
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,460
Yes.

807
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,395
- Yes, what?
- [All] Yes, sir!

808
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,431
[Wolfe] Once upon a time,
there was a family...

809
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,297
...of elves.

810
00:53:59,335 --> 00:54:04,602
And one day the little elf family

811
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:08,007
went into the magic forest

812
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,309
to find a secret...

813
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,440
...gnome...

814
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,881
...facility,

815
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:20,821
where the gnomes were
turning mushrooms into uranium.

816
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:26,829
So three elves laid down heavy
suppressive fire on the gnomes

817
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:32,232
while the others maneuvered
around to the right flank,

818
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:36,636
finishing off anything left alive.

819
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,504
[Sighs]

820
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:44,878
And not one of those elves
were left behind that day.

821
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,109
We got 'em all.

822
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:53,450
Even the teeniest...

823
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,459
...littlest elf of all...

824
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,859
...Rodriguez.

825
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,456
You're gonna have to do
the Panda dance or he won't stop.

826
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,058
- Oh, come on...
- [baby crying]

827
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,297
I don't know how to do
the Panda dance.

828
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,862
I'll write it down for you.

829
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,932
Close your eyes. Go to sleep.
I'll be right back.

830
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,774
You gotta do the dance.

831
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:20,976
Like Dad used to do.
He made it up for him.

832
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,712
[Seth] You have to do the dance
to make him sleep.

833
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:27,688
Come on.

834
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:33,127
<i># When you're down and low
Lower than the floor</i>

835
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:38,498
<i># And you think that you
ain't got a chance, bum, bum</i>

836
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,368
<i># Don't make a move
till you're in the groove</i>

837
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:44,963
- Lulu.
- Thank you.

838
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,271
Seth.

839
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,004
Zoe. Uh!

840
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:50,978
Today you drive.

841
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:54,175
But I can't even
pass Driver's Ed.

842
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,445
Exactly.

843
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,348
We're all gonna die.

844
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,153
Have you ever given
a driving lesson before?

845
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,924
In a minivan? No.

846
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:10,397
Think of it like
a Bradley Assault Vehicle.

847
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:12,058
Especially when Zoe's driving.

848
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,234
- [Gasps]
- [Tires screeching]

849
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,208
- [Lulu] Zoe Plummer!
- [Seth] Zoe, what are you doing?

850
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,767
- [Seth] What are...? Slow down!
- [Lulu] Truck!

851
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:24,779
[Screaming]

852
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,120
- [Wolfe] Whoa! Whoa!
- [Tires screeching]

853
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,055
- [Lulu] Whoa!
- [Wolfe] Not bad.

854
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:41,522
Land! Solid land!

855
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:45,591
- I think it went well.
- Oh, it's so dramatic.

856
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,527
Hey, hey, hey. No fighting.

857
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,267
- Play nicely.
- [Boy] Sorry.

858
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,969
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

859
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:58,309
I have noticed an improvement in the
Plummer kids and I'm very impressed.

860
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,474
Yeah, you know,
they're just misunderstood.

861
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:04,111
[Wolfe] Peter, careful!
Don't make me come up there!

862
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,883
Someone needs to take the time
to talk to 'em.

863
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:11,290
- You're getting a little attached.
- I take my job very seriously.

864
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,258
But it's like you said.
They're just kids.

865
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:19,529
Well, keep up the good work.

866
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,966
Oh!

867
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,405
You look very nice today.

868
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:30,409
Oh. Thanks.

869
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,007
I don't think you understand.
Don't you ever do that again.

870
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,517
Is that clear?
Okay, I've had it.

871
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:40,682
I caught the kid dancing to no music.
I want him out of my class.

872
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:43,658
Somebody's gotta give this punk
a talking to.

873
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,456
Seth?

874
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,396
Well, you got something
to say, twinkle toes?

875
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,502
Yeah. Yeah, I do, Murney.

876
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:55,764
- I quit.
- You quit.

877
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:58,830
You know why you quit?
Because you're a quitter.

878
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,877
And everybody knows
that quitters...

879
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:03,411
...quit.

880
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,149
What are you scared of, Prancer?

881
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:12,313
- I'm not scared. I want to act.
- And I want to take up origami.

882
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,755
<i>- I'm in The Sound of Music.
- Oh. A musical.</i>

883
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,487
You're giving up wrestling
to be in a musical.

884
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,223
That happens when there
isn't a man in the house.

885
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:25,165
There is a man
in the house. It's me.

886
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:29,227
[Laughing] Well,
it's gotta be a tiny house.

887
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,600
You think you're tough, boy,
don't you?

888
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,281
Wanna shave the tiger?
Do you? Huh?

889
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,182
- You want it tough?
- Where did you wanna do this?

890
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:46,381
- What are you talking about?
- You said you wanted to wrestle.

891
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,617
Where? When?

892
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,252
- After school.
- [Wolfe] Okay.

893
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:57,290
- Today?
- That's right. The gym.

894
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,925
Okay?

895
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:03,700
Remember. You mess with
the bull, you get the horns.

896
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,139
[Snorting]

897
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:14,846
[Murney] Out of my way!

898
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:19,752
- How did that feel?
- It was good.

899
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,760
[Boy] Murney is getting
his butt kicked at 3:00!

900
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,492
[Cheering, pounding bleachers]

901
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:38,035
Oh, that is so gross.

902
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,508
[Murney] Come on! Come on!

903
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:44,978
What? That's it!

904
00:59:45,047 --> 00:59:48,574
Someone's gonna get hurt today
and you know who it is?

905
00:59:55,558 --> 01:00:00,154
You're about to enter
Murney's House of Pain!

906
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:05,292
What do you say we go over
the rules, cue ball? Huh?

907
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,136
[Crowd] Oooh!

908
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,570
Rule number one.

909
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,906
Never be too eager
to rush your opponent.

910
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:19,778
Wanna play prison rules, frogman?
Wanna play prison rules? You got it.

911
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,875
- I'll be your daddy.
- [Crowd cheering]

912
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:28,183
- [Cracking]
- Ah!

913
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,090
All right.
Now you've unlocked the beast.

914
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,486
Oh, God!

915
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,293
From this position,
it's relatively easy

916
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:39,960
- to manipulate your opponent.
- Ohhh!

917
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,333
[Groaning]

918
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:43,668
And thus we have
the chicken wing.

919
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:47,165
The chicken wing. [screams]

920
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,972
The arm bar.

921
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:53,479
The crow bar.
Or my personal favorite...

922
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:57,383
- Ahhhh!
... the pacifier!

923
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,523
Any questions?

924
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,829
Anything you
didn't understand?

925
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,894
Ah. The nipple crippler.

926
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:18,873
This is a useless, not to mention,
shameless move

927
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:22,934
that ultimately is a sure sign
of desperation.

928
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,179
And finally...

929
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,550
Pinned!

930
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:39,786
That was awesome!

931
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,629
- Are you okay, Murney?
- Get away from me!

932
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,899
Can I get a little help, please?
I can't move my back. Watch the back!

933
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,188
Go!

934
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,227
Sorry!

935
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,100
I didn't get that cone!

936
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,112
Crawl!

937
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,587
[Beeping]

938
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,025
See? But he usually
breaks down the door.

939
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,818
[Tires screech]

940
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:24,764
Excellent!
