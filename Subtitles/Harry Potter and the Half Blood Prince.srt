1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Encoded by RippeR

2
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,436
I killed Sirius Black!

3
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,797
He's back.

4
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:58,495
The police are
continuing with the investigation...

5
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:00,789
... into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

6
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:04,647
Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.

7
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,420
The surrounding area remains closed.

8
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:09,756
The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...

9
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,429
"Harry Potter."

10
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,514
Who's Harry Potter?

11
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:22,059
Oh, no one.

12
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,040
Bit of a tosser, really.

13
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,211
Funny, that paper of yours.

14
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:31,026
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

15
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,945
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

16
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:45,206
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

17
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:48,229
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

18
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,299
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

19
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:43,802
I like riding around on trains.

20
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:46,930
Takes my mind off things.

21
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:50,370
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

22
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,915
The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.

23
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,626
But now is not the time to tell it.

24
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,399
Take my arm.

25
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,299
Do as I say.

26
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,830
I just Apparated, didn't I?

27
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,166
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

28
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,981
Most people vomit the first time.

29
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,962
I can't imagine why.

30
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:33,431
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

31
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:37,810
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.

32
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,687
Am I right?

33
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:43,232
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

34
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,696
Wands out, Harry.

35
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,521
Horace?

36
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,075
Horace?

37
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,667
Merlin's beard!

38
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:13,107
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

39
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:16,965
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

40
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:22,283
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

41
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,202
Dragon's blood.

42
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,747
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.

43
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,917
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

44
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,481
...Horace Slughorn.

45
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,150
Horace...

46
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:39,173
...well, you know who this is.

47
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,988
Harry Potter.

48
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:46,576
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

49
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:49,183
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?

50
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:51,893
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

51
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,751
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

52
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,315
Do you know what that's like?

53
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,173
You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.

54
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,675
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

55
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:08,784
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

56
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,276
That was fun.

57
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:49,238
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

58
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:53,200
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

59
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:58,935
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

60
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,361
You're very like your father.

61
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,428
- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

62
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:17,285
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

63
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,726
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

64
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,541
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

65
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,731
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

66
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:30,110
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

67
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,091
Right at the front.

68
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:43,560
All mine. Each and every one.

69
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:45,749
Ex-students, I mean.

70
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:52,422
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.

71
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:55,759
Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

72
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,218
...on the news of the day.

73
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:01,076
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

74
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,683
Free tickets whenever I want them.

75
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,915
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

76
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,147
Ah, yes.

77
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,441
Regulus Black.

78
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,611
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

79
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,322
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

80
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,720
It's a shame. Talented boy.

81
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:27,142
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

82
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,227
Horace?

83
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:31,521
Do you mind if I take this?

84
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:39,758
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

85
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:42,990
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

86
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,492
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

87
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,620
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

88
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,748
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

89
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,146
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

90
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,440
Bye.

91
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,994
All right. I'll do it.

92
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:14,686
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

93
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:19,065
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

94
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,506
They are indeed.

95
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:27,823
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

96
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:33,037
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

97
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:36,686
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

98
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,188
You would be his crowning jewel.

99
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:44,923
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

100
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:48,780
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

101
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:53,994
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

102
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:57,539
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

103
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:01,396
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

104
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:04,628
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

105
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,444
Both are waiting for you.

106
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,476
Hedwig.

107
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,334
Mum?

108
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,045
Ginny, what is it?

109
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:51,756
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

110
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,092
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

111
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:58,429
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

112
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:02,182
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

113
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,457
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

114
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,542
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

115
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,774
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

116
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,381
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?

117
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,362
He's wandering about the house.

118
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,239
- Really?
- Really.

119
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,115
Harry!

120
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,039
Harry!

121
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,812
Hello.

122
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,253
What a lovely surprise.

123
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:37,632
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

124
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,655
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

125
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,053
But then, what would we do
without him?

126
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:47,015
Got a bit of toothpaste.

127
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,669
So when did you get here?

128
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,546
A few days ago.

129
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:00,778
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

130
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,844
Mum sort of lost it last week.

131
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:07,972
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

132
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,536
That it's too dangerous.

133
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,560
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

134
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:16,001
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

135
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:20,067
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

136
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,778
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

137
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:28,095
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

138
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:31,953
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

139
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:34,351
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

140
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,332
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

141
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,105
What is he?

142
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:41,441
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

143
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:05,422
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

144
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,986
The Dark Lord trusts him.

145
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:10,739
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.

146
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,331
Run along, Wormtail.

147
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,753
I know I ought not to be here.

148
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,715
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

149
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:54,530
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

150
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:58,909
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

151
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,729
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

152
00:16:06,937 --> 00:16:08,084
You?

153
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,525
The Dark Lord told you?

154
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,653
Your sister doubts me.

155
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:18,510
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

156
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:22,368
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

157
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:27,790
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

158
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,875
I don't doubt you, Severus.

159
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:33,212
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

160
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:39,467
He's just a boy.

161
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:43,325
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

162
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:48,643
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

163
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:53,335
- Severus.
- Swear to it.

164
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,799
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

165
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:06,785
It's just empty words.

166
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:10,121
He'll give it his best effort.

167
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,623
But when it matters most...

168
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,462
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

169
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,571
Coward.

170
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:30,244
Take out your wand.

171
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:44,528
Will you...

172
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:46,822
...Severus Snape...

173
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:49,845
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

174
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:54,850
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

175
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:57,874
I will.

176
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,983
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

177
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,798
...protect him from harm?

178
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:08,613
I will.

179
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:13,200
And if Draco should fail...

180
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:18,935
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

181
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:24,148
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

182
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:30,821
I will.

183
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:56,678
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

184
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:57,825
Nosebleed Nougats!

185
00:18:58,034 --> 00:19:01,057
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

186
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:05,124
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

187
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:08,356
I will have order!

188
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,944
I really hate children. I will have order!

189
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,948
I really hate children. I will have order!

190
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:22,014
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.

191
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,308
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

192
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,185
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

193
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:29,626
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

194
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:33,171
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

195
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,526
Meaning?

196
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,820
Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?

197
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:39,009
It's none of your business.

198
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:45,787
How much for this?

199
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,351
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

200
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,644
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

201
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm your brother.

202
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,398
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.

203
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,047
Come on, let's go.

204
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:00,905
Hi, Ron.

205
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:02,990
Hi.

206
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:20,194
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

207
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:22,904
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

208
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,407
I reckon he's right.

209
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,743
Oh, no.

210
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,558
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.

211
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,425
Harry?

212
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:49,283
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

213
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:51,160
...who don't want to be followed?

214
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:37,717
Quibbler.

215
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:41,054
Quibbler.

216
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:47,727
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

217
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:50,229
- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.

218
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,982
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.

219
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,319
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

220
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,404
Quibbler.

221
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:12,646
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

222
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,522
And who were all those people?

223
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,755
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

224
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,840
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

225
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:22,551
It's happened. He's one of them.

226
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,219
One of what?

227
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:28,389
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

228
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,579
You're barking.

229
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,873
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?

230
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:37,043
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

231
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:39,129
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

232
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:43,091
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

233
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,863
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

234
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:48,408
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

235
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:51,640
I need some air.

236
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:12,180
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

237
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:35,848
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.

238
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:39,080
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

239
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:42,625
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

240
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:56,075
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

241
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:58,265
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

242
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,559
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

243
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,123
What's that supposed to mean?

244
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:07,231
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

245
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:10,776
Amused, Blaise?

246
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:14,634
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

247
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:40,596
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

248
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:44,036
Where's Harry?

249
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:47,164
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

250
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:06,349
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

251
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:08,121
Petrificus Totalus.

252
00:26:19,382 --> 00:26:20,842
Oh, yeah...

253
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:24,491
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

254
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:33,145
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

255
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,812
Finite.

256
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,215
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

257
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:31,324
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

258
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:40,708
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

259
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:44,044
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

260
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:46,233
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

261
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:48,423
That's nice.

262
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:51,759
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

263
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:54,783
Right. Names?

264
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:57,390
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

265
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:59,683
No exceptions, Potter.

266
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:01,977
Who are those people?

267
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:04,480
Aurors. For security.

268
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,148
What's this cane here, then?

269
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:08,650
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

270
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:12,821
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

271
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:17,096
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

272
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,517
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

273
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,797
Nice face, Potter.

274
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,763
Would you like me to fix it for you?

275
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:44,621
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

276
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,394
...but it's up to you.

277
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:49,104
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

278
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,962
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

279
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:57,967
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

280
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,450
- Episkey.
- Ah!

281
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,730
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

282
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,232
Brilliant.

283
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,616
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

284
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:30,184
Will you stop eating?

285
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,687
Your best friend is missing!

286
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:36,023
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

287
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:40,402
He's covered in blood again.

288
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:44,781
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.

289
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,075
Where have you been?

290
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:49,786
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

291
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,558
What've I missed?

292
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,833
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

293
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:59,587
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

294
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,179
Very best of evenings to you all.

295
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:10,326
Thanks.

296
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:17,207
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

297
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,605
...Horace Slughorn.

298
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,444
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

299
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:29,823
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

300
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:32,951
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

301
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,932
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

302
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:36,809
Snape?

303
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:44,420
Now, as you know...

304
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:48,278
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

305
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:50,467
And you have the right to know why.

306
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:54,846
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

307
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:57,453
...sat in this very hall...

308
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,458
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

309
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:07,462
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

310
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,131
His name?

311
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,946
Tom Riddle.

312
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,827
Today, of course...

313
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:22,685
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

314
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:29,045
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

315
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,547
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

316
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,926
Every day, every hour...

317
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,012
...this very minute, perhaps...

318
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,495
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

319
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:49,689
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

320
00:31:52,713 --> 00:31:54,902
Just something to think about.

321
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:57,717
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

322
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:01,158
That was cheerful.

323
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:11,167
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

324
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:17,006
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

325
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,177
Potter.

326
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:24,513
Oh, this can't be good.

327
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,205
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

328
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:33,271
- I had a free period this morning.
- So I noticed.

329
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:36,191
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

330
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,110
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

331
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,489
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

332
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:46,513
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

333
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:51,309
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students...

334
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,290
...with "Exceeds Expectations."

335
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:55,375
Brilliant. Um...

336
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:58,086
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

337
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:03,091
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

338
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,219
I don't wanna take Potions.

339
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:09,138
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

340
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,266
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

341
00:33:12,474 --> 00:33:14,768
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

342
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,688
Ah.

343
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:21,754
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

344
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,526
Ron Weasley, sir.

345
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:26,550
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

346
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,844
- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

347
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:32,076
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

348
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,787
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

349
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,664
Get what you want from the cupboard.

350
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:40,209
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

351
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:44,275
Any ideas what these might be?

352
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,341
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

353
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:56,057
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

354
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:58,976
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

355
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,293
It's terribly tricky to make.

356
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,483
And this is Amortentia...

357
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:09,090
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

358
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:13,781
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

359
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,118
For example, I smell...

360
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,914
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

361
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:25,459
...spearmint toothpaste.

362
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,255
Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

363
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:35,468
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

364
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:42,350
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

365
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,691
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

366
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:52,776
Oh, yes.

367
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,487
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

368
00:34:55,695 --> 00:35:01,117
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

369
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,724
But it is more commonly referred to as...

370
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:09,250
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

371
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,690
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

372
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:18,529
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

373
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,013
At least until the effects wear off.

374
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:27,704
So this is what I offer each of you today.

375
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:32,709
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

376
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:37,505
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

377
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:40,946
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

378
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,699
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

379
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:48,244
...of sufficient quality to
claim this prize.

380
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,059
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

381
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:53,770
Let the brewing commence.

382
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,409
How did you do that?

383
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:34,120
You crush it. Don't cut it.

384
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:36,727
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

385
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:38,812
No, really.

386
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:19,475
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

387
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:24,167
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

388
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:29,380
So here we are, then, as promised.

389
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:32,821
One vial of Felix Felicis.

390
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,010
Congratulations.

391
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:38,242
Use it well.

392
00:38:05,872 --> 00:38:08,583
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

393
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:11,607
How are you?

394
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,275
I'm fine, sir.

395
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:14,735
Enjoying your classes?

396
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:19,010
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

397
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,033
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

398
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:23,806
Do you?

399
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:25,682
Definitely.

400
00:38:27,663 --> 00:38:30,479
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

401
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,711
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

402
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:36,526
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

403
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,881
I can't help wondering...

404
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:43,094
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

405
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,222
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

406
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,246
But enough chitchat.

407
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:53,000
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

408
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,440
The answer lies here.

409
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,568
What you are looking at are memories.

410
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:03,634
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

411
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:06,241
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

412
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:13,122
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

413
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:15,520
...of the day I first met him.

414
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,587
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

415
00:39:57,226 --> 00:40:01,501
I admit some confusion upon
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

416
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:05,254
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

417
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:09,216
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

418
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:13,804
Tom, you have a visitor.

419
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,993
How do you do, Tom?

420
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,752
Don't.

421
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:35,699
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

422
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:37,889
I am a professor.

423
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,391
I don't believe you.

424
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,581
She wants me looked at.

425
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,396
They think I'm different.

426
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:47,064
Well, perhaps they're right.

427
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:48,732
I'm not mad.

428
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:52,173
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

429
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,362
Hogwarts is a school.

430
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,239
A school of magic.

431
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:03,538
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

432
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:07,291
Things other children can't.

433
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:11,670
I can make things move
without touching them.

434
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:16,154
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

435
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:20,533
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

436
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:23,139
I can make them hurt...

437
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:25,224
...if I want.

438
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,727
Who are you?

439
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:30,021
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

440
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:32,731
I'm different.

441
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,130
Prove it.

442
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:46,599
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

443
00:41:56,295 --> 00:42:00,049
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

444
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:05,887
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

445
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:07,243
You understand me?

446
00:42:11,205 --> 00:42:13,811
I can speak to snakes too.

447
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:16,835
They find me.

448
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:19,754
Whisper things.

449
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:23,091
Is that normal for someone like me?

450
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:47,488
Did you know, sir? Then?

451
00:42:47,593 --> 00:42:53,223
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

452
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:55,934
If I had, I...

453
00:42:57,602 --> 00:43:00,104
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

454
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:03,545
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

455
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:05,526
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

456
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:11,990
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

457
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,180
No, I did not.

458
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:18,142
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

459
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:21,061
And he will not give it up easily.

460
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:24,398
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

461
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:25,857
I did.

462
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:28,568
Do you want me to let him?

463
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:31,279
Yes.

464
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,192
All right. Um...

465
00:44:57,297 --> 00:45:00,425
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

466
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,718
...just to assess your strengths.

467
00:45:03,448 --> 00:45:05,429
Quiet! Please!

468
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:06,785
Shut it!

469
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:13,353
Thanks. All right. Um...

470
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:15,647
Just because you
made the team last year...

471
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:18,775
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?

472
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:22,529
Good.

473
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:33,476
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

474
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,249
Hard feelings?

475
00:45:35,457 --> 00:45:39,002
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

476
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,817
Really? Strapping guy like you?

477
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:44,528
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

478
00:45:44,737 --> 00:45:47,135
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

479
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,263
Oh, I like my chances.

480
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:54,225
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

481
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:58,604
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

482
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:12,575
Come on, Weasley!

483
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:14,452
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!

484
00:46:16,016 --> 00:46:18,935
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!

485
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,291
Go on, Cormac!

486
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,954
Come on, Ron!

487
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:48,859
Come on, Ron.

488
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,465
Come on, Ron.

489
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:10,546
Confundus.

490
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:29,000
Isn't he brilliant?

491
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:35,256
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

492
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,384
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

493
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:41,825
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

494
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:44,953
He's vile.

495
00:47:49,853 --> 00:47:52,147
Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?

496
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:54,336
No, I haven't.

497
00:47:54,545 --> 00:47:57,673
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

498
00:47:57,881 --> 00:48:00,279
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

499
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:04,658
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

500
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:07,057
What?

501
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:10,602
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

502
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,270
No.

503
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:15,085
Why not?

504
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,274
The binding is fragile.

505
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:19,985
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

506
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,824
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

507
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:29,786
That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince."

508
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:50,430
For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...

509
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,933
... yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?

510
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:56,478
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

511
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:57,729
Well, it's true.

512
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:01,691
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

513
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:03,776
It's just like being with Hermione.

514
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:07,634
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

515
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:10,345
- The library.
- The library. And?

516
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,847
And nothing.

517
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:16,079
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

518
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,373
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!

519
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,875
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

520
00:49:20,979 --> 00:49:25,671
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

521
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,614
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

522
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,221
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

523
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:37,974
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

524
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,581
No, not there. Over here.

525
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:42,771
No, sit beside me.

526
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:45,794
Okay.

527
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:48,609
Something to drink?

528
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:51,320
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

529
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:05,083
Oh, bloody hell.

530
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:09,879
Slick git.

531
00:50:10,192 --> 00:50:12,903
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

532
00:50:15,718 --> 00:50:16,969
And snogging.

533
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:20,618
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

534
00:50:20,723 --> 00:50:22,391
You can't be serious.

535
00:50:22,495 --> 00:50:24,893
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

536
00:50:25,102 --> 00:50:28,959
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?

537
00:50:30,315 --> 00:50:32,713
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

538
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:34,902
And you, and you.

539
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:36,883
So, what brings you here?

540
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:41,784
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

541
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:45,329
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

542
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:48,874
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

543
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:52,419
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

544
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,817
...for the select student or two.

545
00:50:55,025 --> 00:50:58,883
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.

546
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:02,532
You would be welcome too, Granger.

547
00:51:03,262 --> 00:51:08,058
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

548
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:10,873
Good to see you, Wallenby.

549
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,546
What are you playing at?

550
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,613
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

551
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:23,802
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

552
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:27,660
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

553
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,375
Got a little bit...

554
00:51:46,323 --> 00:51:48,200
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

555
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:49,764
- Harry.
- What?

556
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:53,517
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?

557
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:56,020
As if.

558
00:52:02,484 --> 00:52:05,820
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

559
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:30,009
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

560
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:47,317
Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?

561
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:03,374
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

562
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:06,085
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

563
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:08,274
It's like I said.

564
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:13,383
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

565
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:17,345
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

566
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:21,724
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

567
00:53:22,037 --> 00:53:24,644
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

568
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,861
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

569
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:40,387
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

570
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:42,577
McGONAGALL:
Oh, Severus.

571
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:50,084
What do you think?

572
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:56,861
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

573
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:59,259
She was cursed, wasn't she?

574
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:02,074
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

575
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:06,141
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

576
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:08,226
Yes, she was cursed.

577
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,728
It was Malfoy.

578
00:54:12,605 --> 00:54:16,463
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

579
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,131
Indeed.

580
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:22,406
- Your evidence?
- I just know.

581
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:25,117
You just...

582
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:27,723
...know.

583
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,728
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

584
00:54:32,832 --> 00:54:36,794
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

585
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:43,154
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

586
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:51,287
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

587
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:04,737
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

588
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,490
Well, what does she see in him?

589
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:10,784
Dean? He's brilliant.

590
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:13,808
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

591
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:17,770
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

592
00:55:17,978 --> 00:55:22,462
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.

593
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:24,651
I suppose.

594
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:29,134
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

595
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,262
She's smart, funny.

596
00:55:32,992 --> 00:55:35,286
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

597
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:40,395
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

598
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,001
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

599
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,693
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

600
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,802
Hermione's got nice skin.

601
00:55:53,532 --> 00:55:56,243
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

602
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:59,371
I've never really thought about it.

603
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:02,603
But, I suppose, yeah.

604
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,793
Very nice.

605
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:12,612
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.

606
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:26,375
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

607
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:29,086
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

608
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,484
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

609
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,612
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

610
00:56:34,716 --> 00:56:36,697
What about your uncle, Belby?

611
00:56:36,906 --> 00:56:40,347
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

612
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:43,370
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

613
00:56:43,474 --> 00:56:47,541
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

614
00:56:47,749 --> 00:56:51,086
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

615
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:56,299
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?

616
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,905
My parents are dentists.

617
00:57:03,493 --> 00:57:04,744
They tend to people's teeth.

618
00:57:04,953 --> 00:57:09,645
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

619
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:11,104
No.

620
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:17,569
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

621
00:57:17,777 --> 00:57:19,028
He needed 10 stitches.

622
00:57:25,284 --> 00:57:28,933
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

623
00:57:31,644 --> 00:57:36,023
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

624
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:38,943
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

625
00:57:42,696 --> 00:57:47,180
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

626
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,146
What?

627
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:57,919
Nothing.

628
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:07,928
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

629
00:58:12,828 --> 00:58:14,497
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

630
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:17,312
I was just admiring your hourglass.

631
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,127
Oh, yes.

632
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:22,733
A most intriguing object.

633
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,634
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

634
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:31,179
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

635
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,577
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

636
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:37,122
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

637
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:39,520
As to some of your classmates...

638
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:43,065
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

639
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:44,733
The shelf, sir?

640
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,008
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

641
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:52,970
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

642
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:56,515
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

643
00:58:58,704 --> 00:59:02,666
You knew him, didn't you, sir,
Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

644
00:59:03,709 --> 00:59:07,254
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

645
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:08,922
What was he like?

646
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:15,074
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

647
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:17,576
He killed my parents.

648
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:21,538
Of course.

649
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:24,979
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

650
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,879
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

651
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:33,111
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

652
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:37,490
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

653
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,367
Not unlike others I've known.

654
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,078
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

655
00:59:43,433 --> 00:59:45,519
If the monster existed...

656
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,334
...it was buried deep within.

657
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:07,101
Good luck, eh, Ron.

658
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:10,959
- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.

659
01:00:11,168 --> 01:00:14,191
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

660
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,694
- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!

661
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:20,447
What's he wearing?

662
01:00:29,101 --> 01:00:30,873
So how was it, then?

663
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,418
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

664
01:00:34,627 --> 01:00:36,295
Pretty boring, actually.

665
01:00:37,025 --> 01:00:39,423
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

666
01:00:42,759 --> 01:00:45,575
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

667
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:47,243
And we're meant to bring someone.

668
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:51,101
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

669
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:54,124
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?

670
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:59,025
Good luck today, Ron.

671
01:00:59,859 --> 01:01:02,153
I know you'll be brilliant.

672
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:08,930
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

673
01:01:09,138 --> 01:01:10,598
Have it your way.

674
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:13,309
- Juice?
- Sure.

675
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:15,185
Hello, everyone.

676
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:18,522
You look dreadful, Ron.

677
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:21,024
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

678
01:01:23,214 --> 01:01:24,882
Is it a tonic?

679
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:29,991
Liquid luck.

680
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:33,015
Don't drink it, Ron.

681
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:43,962
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

682
01:01:46,152 --> 01:01:48,863
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

683
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:14,512
Yes!

684
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:17,848
Go on, Ron! Do it!

685
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,027
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

686
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:55,904
Yes!

687
01:02:56,008 --> 01:02:59,553
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

688
01:03:03,307 --> 01:03:04,871
Whoo!

689
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:08,312
Yes. Whoo!

690
01:03:09,771 --> 01:03:14,880
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

691
01:03:19,155 --> 01:03:20,823
You really shouldn't have done it.

692
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:26,036
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

693
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,667
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

694
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,150
You didn't put it in.

695
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:39,695
Ron only thought you did.

696
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:30,784
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

697
01:04:34,642 --> 01:04:36,519
Well, they're really good.

698
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,026
How does it feel, Harry?

699
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,073
When you see Dean with Ginny?

700
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,641
I know.

701
01:04:57,684 --> 01:04:59,874
I see the way you look at her.

702
01:05:00,603 --> 01:05:02,167
You're my best friend.

703
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:13,115
Oops.

704
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:16,764
I think this room's taken.

705
01:05:18,537 --> 01:05:19,997
What's with the birds?

706
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,105
Oppugno.

707
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:54,821
It feels like this.

708
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:37,569
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

709
01:06:37,673 --> 01:06:42,782
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

710
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,346
It's chemical.

711
01:06:44,554 --> 01:06:48,933
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.

712
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,853
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

713
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:54,459
I really couldn't care less.

714
01:06:54,668 --> 01:06:58,526
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

715
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,194
Yes.

716
01:07:00,298 --> 01:07:04,782
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

717
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:06,137
Have you?

718
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:08,326
Yes. Why?

719
01:07:08,431 --> 01:07:12,080
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

720
01:07:12,288 --> 01:07:14,478
...we should go together, as friends.

721
01:07:14,687 --> 01:07:16,251
Why didn't I think of that?

722
01:07:16,459 --> 01:07:18,023
Who are you going with?

723
01:07:18,127 --> 01:07:20,004
Um, it's a surprise.

724
01:07:20,108 --> 01:07:24,383
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.

725
01:07:25,009 --> 01:07:26,885
See that girl over there?

726
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:33,141
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

727
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,809
Really?

728
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:39,293
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

729
01:07:39,397 --> 01:07:41,170
But I am the Chosen One.

730
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:44,193
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

731
01:07:46,174 --> 01:07:47,634
I'll ask someone I like.

732
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:50,032
Someone cool.

733
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:02,752
I've never been to this part of the castle.

734
01:08:02,961 --> 01:08:06,193
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

735
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:08,904
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

736
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:43,102
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

737
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:58,325
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

738
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,599
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

739
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,656
Drink?

740
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,846
Neville.

741
01:09:21,054 --> 01:09:22,514
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

742
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:25,746
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

743
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:28,770
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

744
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:42,115
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

745
01:09:42,324 --> 01:09:47,641
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

746
01:09:47,746 --> 01:09:50,769
Cormac? That's who you invited?

747
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,480
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

748
01:09:54,314 --> 01:09:56,295
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

749
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:59,527
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

750
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:01,821
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

751
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,636
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

752
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:06,617
On second thoughts...

753
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,807
Might keep Cormac at bay.

754
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,039
Oh, God, here he comes.

755
01:10:14,646 --> 01:10:17,461
I think she just went to powder her nose.

756
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:19,755
Slippery little minx, your friend.

757
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:22,674
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

758
01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:27,679
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

759
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:30,494
Dragon balls.

760
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,778
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

761
01:10:44,986 --> 01:10:48,844
Not so quick, Potter.

762
01:10:50,408 --> 01:10:53,536
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

763
01:10:53,744 --> 01:10:57,602
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

764
01:10:57,811 --> 01:11:00,000
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

765
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:02,920
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

766
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,777
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

767
01:11:06,882 --> 01:11:08,446
You see...

768
01:11:08,654 --> 01:11:14,180
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

769
01:11:14,389 --> 01:11:15,848
Traveling where?

770
01:11:23,981 --> 01:11:25,858
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

771
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:28,777
Professor Slughorn, sir.

772
01:11:28,881 --> 01:11:33,260
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

773
01:11:33,365 --> 01:11:35,450
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

774
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,891
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

775
01:11:39,516 --> 01:11:43,270
I'll escort him out.

776
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:49,734
Certainly, professor.

777
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:56,615
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

778
01:11:58,701 --> 01:12:03,601
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

779
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,895
I swore to protect you.

780
01:12:06,103 --> 01:12:09,440
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

781
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:11,734
I don't need protection.

782
01:12:11,942 --> 01:12:16,113
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

783
01:12:17,051 --> 01:12:20,492
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

784
01:12:21,117 --> 01:12:25,079
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

785
01:12:25,184 --> 01:12:26,643
No!

786
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,397
I was chosen. This is my moment.

787
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:44,472
"Unbreakable Vow."

788
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:46,245
You're sure that's what Snape said?

789
01:12:46,453 --> 01:12:48,643
Positive. Why?

790
01:12:48,852 --> 01:12:52,397
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

791
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,837
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

792
01:12:56,359 --> 01:12:58,131
You don't understand.

793
01:12:58,757 --> 01:12:59,799
Oh, bloody hell.

794
01:13:27,638 --> 01:13:29,514
I miss you.

795
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:32,851
Lovely.

796
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:36,292
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

797
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,690
I'll take your word for it.

798
01:13:48,803 --> 01:13:53,704
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

799
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:55,997
You die.

800
01:14:00,585 --> 01:14:02,462
Wait, the pudding's still here.

801
01:14:03,713 --> 01:14:07,049
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

802
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:08,300
I know it sounds mad.

803
01:14:08,405 --> 01:14:11,950
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

804
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:14,556
...so he could find out
what he was up to?

805
01:14:14,765 --> 01:14:17,788
- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right.

806
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,978
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

807
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:23,627
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

808
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:27,902
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

809
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,153
You're blinded by hatred.

810
01:14:29,362 --> 01:14:31,447
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

811
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:36,139
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

812
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,328
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

813
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:41,456
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

814
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,418
Open up, you.

815
01:15:09,086 --> 01:15:10,754
Don't you trust me?

816
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:18,053
It's good.

817
01:15:18,991 --> 01:15:21,806
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

818
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:31,399
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

819
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:44,849
You'll have to forgive Remus.

820
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:47,976
It takes its toll, his condition.

821
01:15:48,915 --> 01:15:50,896
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

822
01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:53,607
We're being followed, all of us.

823
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,318
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

824
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:59,237
It's not been easy.

825
01:16:01,218 --> 01:16:02,573
Did you get my owl?

826
01:16:02,782 --> 01:16:04,867
Yes, I did.

827
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:09,455
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

828
01:16:09,559 --> 01:16:12,061
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

829
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:15,294
As for Draco Malfoy...

830
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:17,066
...I know a bit more.

831
01:16:17,692 --> 01:16:20,715
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

832
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:23,218
I think, from what you described...

833
01:16:23,426 --> 01:16:25,094
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

834
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,744
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

835
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:30,412
...is a vanishing cabinet.

836
01:16:31,246 --> 01:16:32,601
A vanishing cabinet?

837
01:16:32,706 --> 01:16:36,772
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

838
01:16:36,876 --> 01:16:39,900
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

839
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:44,800
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

840
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:47,198
They can transport you anywhere.

841
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:50,743
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

842
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:53,767
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

843
01:16:53,975 --> 01:16:55,122
Nothing.

844
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:57,625
It's still there.

845
01:17:08,781 --> 01:17:10,449
It was delicious, Molly, really.

846
01:17:10,658 --> 01:17:11,909
Are you sure you won't stay?

847
01:17:12,117 --> 01:17:16,496
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

848
01:17:16,705 --> 01:17:17,643
Remus?

849
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,174
Sweetheart.

850
01:17:36,515 --> 01:17:38,183
Has Ron gone to bed?

851
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:41,207
Um... Not yet. No.

852
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:44,335
Shoelace.

853
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:58,827
Merry Christmas, Harry.

854
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:01,747
Merry Christmas.

855
01:18:19,055 --> 01:18:21,348
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

856
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:32,609
Ginny!

857
01:18:35,737 --> 01:18:40,429
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!

858
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:42,827
You coming to get me?

859
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:47,310
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

860
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:18,381
Harry?

861
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,565
Stupefy!

862
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:02,171
Harry!

863
01:20:15,726 --> 01:20:16,872
Ginny!

864
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:47,943
Molly.

865
01:21:10,985 --> 01:21:12,653
It's easy for them to get to you.

866
01:21:12,862 --> 01:21:16,928
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

867
01:21:17,137 --> 01:21:19,639
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

868
01:21:20,682 --> 01:21:21,829
Sorry.

869
01:21:23,497 --> 01:21:26,833
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

870
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:29,127
That's my Won-Won.

871
01:21:31,212 --> 01:21:33,610
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

872
01:21:51,231 --> 01:21:53,525
I'd like to know
where you get your information.

873
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:56,757
More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.

874
01:22:02,387 --> 01:22:03,951
Sir...

875
01:22:04,368 --> 01:22:07,183
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

876
01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:10,207
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

877
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:14,586
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

878
01:22:15,212 --> 01:22:17,505
But how did you know?

879
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:20,842
Intuition.

880
01:22:25,117 --> 01:22:26,785
Gracious. Is it that time already?

881
01:22:26,993 --> 01:22:30,643
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

882
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:38,567
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

883
01:22:40,548 --> 01:22:42,529
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

884
01:22:43,884 --> 01:22:46,699
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

885
01:22:47,638 --> 01:22:52,642
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

886
01:22:53,059 --> 01:22:56,083
They might misunderstand.

887
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:57,856
Go on.

888
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,879
I was in the library the other night...

889
01:23:01,505 --> 01:23:03,694
...in the Restricted Section...

890
01:23:04,424 --> 01:23:07,969
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

891
01:23:08,907 --> 01:23:12,348
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

892
01:23:12,557 --> 01:23:15,372
It's called, as I understand it...

893
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,438
I beg your pardon?

894
01:23:19,647 --> 01:23:23,192
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

895
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:28,196
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

896
01:23:31,116 --> 01:23:32,263
Confused?

897
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,452
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

898
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,101
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

899
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,959
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

900
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:44,044
It is also a lie.

901
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,755
This memory has been tampered with...

902
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:51,343
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

903
01:23:51,968 --> 01:23:53,949
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

904
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:56,973
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

905
01:23:57,182 --> 01:23:58,641
Why, indeed?

906
01:23:59,475 --> 01:24:02,812
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

907
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,565
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

908
01:24:06,774 --> 01:24:08,338
...any way you can.

909
01:24:08,546 --> 01:24:10,423
I don't know him that well, sir.

910
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:17,826
This memory is everything.

911
01:24:18,347 --> 01:24:20,328
Without it, we are blind.

912
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:24,499
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

913
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,356
You have no choice.

914
01:24:29,608 --> 01:24:31,589
You must not fail.

915
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:42,015
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

916
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,579
...with the chapter on antidotes.

917
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:47,541
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

918
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:50,147
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

919
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:59,427
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

920
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:01,512
To what do I owe this pleasure?

921
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:04,744
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

922
01:25:04,953 --> 01:25:07,247
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

923
01:25:07,351 --> 01:25:10,375
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

924
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:14,232
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

925
01:25:15,588 --> 01:25:18,194
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

926
01:25:18,403 --> 01:25:21,739
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

927
01:25:21,948 --> 01:25:26,223
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

928
01:25:28,204 --> 01:25:29,559
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

929
01:25:29,768 --> 01:25:32,583
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

930
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:34,668
Yes. Um...

931
01:25:34,877 --> 01:25:37,275
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

932
01:25:37,483 --> 01:25:39,256
What I mean to say is...

933
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:41,862
...well, he's not like you.

934
01:25:42,592 --> 01:25:44,365
He might misunderstand.

935
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,578
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

936
01:25:49,682 --> 01:25:53,748
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

937
01:25:54,374 --> 01:25:56,042
I suggest you do the same.

938
01:25:56,459 --> 01:25:59,379
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

939
01:26:06,364 --> 01:26:09,388
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

940
01:26:11,473 --> 01:26:13,037
Didn't he?

941
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,691
Yes?

942
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:24,193
Oh, it's you, Potter.

943
01:26:24,402 --> 01:26:26,800
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

944
01:26:39,624 --> 01:26:43,378
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

945
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,776
Divine.

946
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:48,800
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

947
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:53,491
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

948
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,141
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

949
01:26:57,349 --> 01:26:59,330
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

950
01:26:59,539 --> 01:27:01,832
She could never annoy me.

951
01:27:03,605 --> 01:27:05,169
I think I love her.

952
01:27:08,714 --> 01:27:11,008
Well, brilliant.

953
01:27:14,865 --> 01:27:16,534
Do you think she knows I exist?

954
01:27:16,638 --> 01:27:19,140
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

955
01:27:19,349 --> 01:27:22,268
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

956
01:27:23,207 --> 01:27:24,458
Who are you talking about?

957
01:27:25,188 --> 01:27:28,837
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

958
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:30,505
Okay, very funny.

959
01:27:33,633 --> 01:27:37,282
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

960
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:40,306
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

961
01:27:41,348 --> 01:27:44,268
No. Can you introduce me?

962
01:28:05,955 --> 01:28:10,751
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

963
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:25,139
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

964
01:28:26,077 --> 01:28:27,433
Where's Romilda?

965
01:28:27,641 --> 01:28:29,518
What's the matter with Wenby?

966
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,916
Very powerful love potion.

967
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,419
Very well. Better bring him in.

968
01:28:34,627 --> 01:28:37,859
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

969
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:40,987
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

970
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:44,219
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

971
01:28:44,428 --> 01:28:46,096
Perhaps you're right.

972
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:56,001
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

973
01:28:56,210 --> 01:29:00,589
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

974
01:29:00,693 --> 01:29:03,612
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

975
01:29:03,821 --> 01:29:06,428
All the questions about Voldemort.

976
01:29:06,532 --> 01:29:08,409
Don't use that name.

977
01:29:16,124 --> 01:29:18,209
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

978
01:29:18,418 --> 01:29:21,441
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

979
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:38,332
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

980
01:29:38,436 --> 01:29:40,626
A bloody strong one at that.

981
01:29:41,147 --> 01:29:44,797
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up.

982
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:48,654
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

983
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:53,138
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

984
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,100
Here we are, Potter.

985
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:58,768
To life!

986
01:30:03,668 --> 01:30:04,607
Ron.

987
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:10,550
Ron. Professor, do something.

988
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,261
I don't understand.

989
01:30:29,734 --> 01:30:31,507
Come on, Ron, breathe.

990
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:56,530
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

991
01:31:07,582 --> 01:31:10,918
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

992
01:31:11,127 --> 01:31:13,421
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

993
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:17,070
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

994
01:31:17,278 --> 01:31:19,989
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

995
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:24,160
The question is,
why were they necessary?

996
01:31:24,368 --> 01:31:26,037
Why, indeed?

997
01:31:26,245 --> 01:31:28,226
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

998
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:31,354
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

999
01:31:31,563 --> 01:31:35,525
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

1000
01:31:35,733 --> 01:31:38,131
...when not polluted with poison.

1001
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:41,468
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

1002
01:31:41,676 --> 01:31:43,032
To whom, I might ask?

1003
01:31:44,804 --> 01:31:46,994
To you, Headmaster.

1004
01:31:49,392 --> 01:31:50,434
Where is he?

1005
01:31:50,643 --> 01:31:54,709
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

1006
01:31:57,733 --> 01:31:59,401
What's she doing here?

1007
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:01,799
I might ask you the same question.

1008
01:32:02,008 --> 01:32:04,301
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1009
01:32:04,406 --> 01:32:07,221
I happen to be his friend.

1010
01:32:07,325 --> 01:32:11,600
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1011
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:15,249
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

1012
01:32:15,458 --> 01:32:19,107
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1013
01:32:19,315 --> 01:32:22,130
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1014
01:32:23,799 --> 01:32:28,803
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1015
01:32:29,012 --> 01:32:32,244
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1016
01:32:32,974 --> 01:32:34,746
I'm here.

1017
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:43,817
Uh... Hermione...

1018
01:32:47,884 --> 01:32:49,865
Hermione.

1019
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,888
Hermione.

1020
01:33:00,499 --> 01:33:04,357
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1021
01:33:04,774 --> 01:33:07,068
Well, come away, everybody.

1022
01:33:07,277 --> 01:33:09,883
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1023
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:16,660
About time, don't you think?

1024
01:33:19,371 --> 01:33:20,935
Thank you.

1025
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:25,627
Oh, shut up.

1026
01:35:37,938 --> 01:35:41,795
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1027
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:48,885
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1028
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:52,534
Um, well...

1029
01:35:52,743 --> 01:35:55,767
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1030
01:35:56,601 --> 01:35:58,999
And you talked.

1031
01:36:00,667 --> 01:36:04,733
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1032
01:36:04,838 --> 01:36:08,174
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1033
01:36:08,383 --> 01:36:10,676
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1034
01:36:17,141 --> 01:36:20,686
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1035
01:36:22,354 --> 01:36:27,358
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

1036
01:36:27,567 --> 01:36:30,486
Anything at all?

1037
01:36:30,695 --> 01:36:32,467
There is something.

1038
01:36:36,012 --> 01:36:40,496
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1039
01:36:41,955 --> 01:36:45,188
Right. Boggled.

1040
01:36:52,486 --> 01:36:53,737
Harry.

1041
01:36:55,197 --> 01:36:56,344
That's Katie.

1042
01:36:58,325 --> 01:36:59,889
Katie Bell.

1043
01:37:07,604 --> 01:37:10,002
Katie. How are you?

1044
01:37:10,628 --> 01:37:15,111
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

1045
01:37:16,779 --> 01:37:20,324
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1046
01:37:20,741 --> 01:37:24,182
But I just can't.

1047
01:37:37,424 --> 01:37:38,779
Katie?

1048
01:38:21,214 --> 01:38:25,281
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?

1049
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:57,602
Sectumsempra!

1050
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:47,545
Vulnera Sanentur.

1051
01:39:49,213 --> 01:39:52,028
Vulnera Sanentur.

1052
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:57,241
Vulnera Sanentur.

1053
01:40:18,302 --> 01:40:21,847
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1054
01:40:26,748 --> 01:40:28,312
Take my hand.

1055
01:40:44,368 --> 01:40:46,245
The Room of Requirement.

1056
01:40:52,709 --> 01:40:55,316
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1057
01:40:55,525 --> 01:40:59,174
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1058
01:41:07,619 --> 01:41:08,975
- What was that?
- What was that?

1059
01:41:35,145 --> 01:41:36,500
See?

1060
01:41:37,022 --> 01:41:39,003
You never know what you'll find up here.

1061
01:41:58,187 --> 01:42:02,149
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1062
01:42:06,007 --> 01:42:07,675
Close your eyes.

1063
01:42:34,367 --> 01:42:37,182
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1064
01:42:51,883 --> 01:42:54,281
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1065
01:42:54,385 --> 01:42:55,532
What?

1066
01:42:55,741 --> 01:42:57,826
You know, hide the book?

1067
01:42:58,034 --> 01:42:59,911
Oh, yeah.

1068
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:05,333
Ah. Dear, yes.

1069
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:08,356
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

1070
01:43:10,442 --> 01:43:11,693
Luck.

1071
01:43:12,736 --> 01:43:16,072
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1072
01:43:34,214 --> 01:43:37,446
Well, how do you feel?

1073
01:43:37,655 --> 01:43:39,219
Excellent.

1074
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:42,451
Really excellent.

1075
01:43:45,162 --> 01:43:46,726
Remember...

1076
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:48,811
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1077
01:43:49,019 --> 01:43:52,043
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1078
01:43:52,147 --> 01:43:53,711
Right.

1079
01:43:54,128 --> 01:43:56,214
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

1080
01:43:56,422 --> 01:43:59,133
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1081
01:44:00,697 --> 01:44:03,303
- We have a plan.
- I know...

1082
01:44:03,408 --> 01:44:05,493
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1083
01:44:05,701 --> 01:44:09,455
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

1084
01:44:10,289 --> 01:44:12,583
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1085
01:44:12,791 --> 01:44:14,877
Or Felix does.

1086
01:44:16,024 --> 01:44:17,483
Hi!

1087
01:44:48,137 --> 01:44:49,805
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1088
01:44:50,014 --> 01:44:54,184
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1089
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:56,269
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1090
01:44:56,478 --> 01:44:59,814
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1091
01:45:00,023 --> 01:45:02,108
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1092
01:45:02,317 --> 01:45:05,028
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1093
01:45:05,236 --> 01:45:08,781
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

1094
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:11,283
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1095
01:45:11,492 --> 01:45:15,037
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1096
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:18,999
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1097
01:45:19,103 --> 01:45:22,440
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1098
01:45:25,672 --> 01:45:27,861
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1099
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:29,529
Through the front door, sir.

1100
01:45:29,738 --> 01:45:31,823
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1101
01:45:32,032 --> 01:45:33,700
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1102
01:45:33,909 --> 01:45:36,202
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1103
01:45:37,036 --> 01:45:38,600
Harry!

1104
01:45:39,435 --> 01:45:41,937
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

1105
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:45,482
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1106
01:45:45,690 --> 01:45:48,297
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1107
01:45:53,614 --> 01:45:56,847
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

1108
01:45:57,055 --> 01:45:58,723
...back to the castle immediately!

1109
01:45:58,932 --> 01:46:02,164
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1110
01:46:03,519 --> 01:46:05,605
And what makes you say that?

1111
01:46:06,752 --> 01:46:08,316
No idea.

1112
01:46:15,093 --> 01:46:16,448
Horace.

1113
01:46:17,074 --> 01:46:22,391
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1114
01:46:23,017 --> 01:46:25,102
A dead one, I think, sir.

1115
01:46:25,832 --> 01:46:27,396
Good God.

1116
01:46:28,021 --> 01:46:31,149
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

1117
01:46:31,462 --> 01:46:34,903
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1118
01:46:35,007 --> 01:46:39,282
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1119
01:46:39,803 --> 01:46:43,244
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1120
01:46:43,348 --> 01:46:45,538
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1121
01:46:46,059 --> 01:46:47,936
Not to mention the pincers.

1122
01:46:52,315 --> 01:46:54,192
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1123
01:46:54,921 --> 01:46:58,258
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1124
01:46:58,466 --> 01:47:02,533
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

1125
01:47:02,741 --> 01:47:04,931
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

1126
01:47:05,139 --> 01:47:07,746
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1127
01:47:07,954 --> 01:47:10,769
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1128
01:47:10,978 --> 01:47:12,229
My thoughts exactly.

1129
01:47:12,333 --> 01:47:18,902
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1130
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:24,115
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1131
01:47:24,845 --> 01:47:27,243
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1132
01:47:27,452 --> 01:47:31,101
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1133
01:47:32,561 --> 01:47:34,125
Oh, dear.

1134
01:47:43,821 --> 01:47:47,053
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

1135
01:47:47,262 --> 01:47:48,826
He had a family, I trust?

1136
01:47:49,034 --> 01:47:50,494
Oh, yeah.

1137
01:47:55,811 --> 01:47:57,271
Farewell...

1138
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,356
Aragog.

1139
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,759
Farewell, Aragog...

1140
01:48:07,176 --> 01:48:09,887
...king of the arachnids.

1141
01:48:10,721 --> 01:48:13,223
Your body will decay...

1142
01:48:14,475 --> 01:48:17,290
...but your spirit lingers on.

1143
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:24,692
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

1144
01:48:39,915 --> 01:48:43,460
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1145
01:48:43,668 --> 01:48:47,318
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1146
01:48:47,526 --> 01:48:52,739
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1147
01:48:52,844 --> 01:48:58,057
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1148
01:48:58,265 --> 01:48:59,829
Poof.

1149
01:48:59,934 --> 01:49:03,166
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

1150
01:49:03,374 --> 01:49:07,023
But that's life, I suppose.

1151
01:49:07,232 --> 01:49:12,549
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1152
01:49:12,758 --> 01:49:16,407
- Poof.
- Poof.

1153
01:49:31,004 --> 01:49:34,028
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1154
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:39,345
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1155
01:49:40,284 --> 01:49:43,203
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1156
01:49:44,037 --> 01:49:47,582
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1157
01:49:49,146 --> 01:49:51,544
As I watched, it sank.

1158
01:49:53,108 --> 01:49:55,923
Just before it reached the bottom...

1159
01:49:56,132 --> 01:49:57,591
...it transformed...

1160
01:49:58,947 --> 01:50:00,719
...into a wee fish.

1161
01:50:02,492 --> 01:50:04,577
It was beautiful magic.

1162
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:07,809
Wondrous to behold.

1163
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:13,231
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1164
01:50:15,629 --> 01:50:16,567
Your mother.

1165
01:50:18,653 --> 01:50:21,155
The day I came downstairs...

1166
01:50:22,093 --> 01:50:24,387
...the day the bowl was empty...

1167
01:50:25,951 --> 01:50:28,141
...was the day your mother...

1168
01:50:32,103 --> 01:50:34,084
I know why you're here.

1169
01:50:37,107 --> 01:50:39,088
But I can't help you.

1170
01:50:40,965 --> 01:50:42,633
It would ruin me.

1171
01:50:46,387 --> 01:50:48,785
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1172
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:51,183
The night I got this?

1173
01:50:52,955 --> 01:50:54,519
Because of her.

1174
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:57,230
Because she sacrificed herself.

1175
01:50:57,751 --> 01:51:00,045
Because she refused to step aside.

1176
01:51:00,254 --> 01:51:03,486
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1177
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:07,344
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1178
01:51:08,178 --> 01:51:10,263
I'm going to tell you something.

1179
01:51:11,201 --> 01:51:14,121
Something others have only guessed at.

1180
01:51:16,102 --> 01:51:17,666
It's true.

1181
01:51:18,187 --> 01:51:19,543
I am the Chosen One.

1182
01:51:20,481 --> 01:51:22,670
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1183
01:51:22,879 --> 01:51:26,215
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1184
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,718
...and I need to know what you told him.

1185
01:51:29,448 --> 01:51:31,846
Be brave, professor.

1186
01:51:33,514 --> 01:51:35,599
Be brave like my mother.

1187
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:39,561
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1188
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:42,898
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1189
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:49,153
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1190
01:51:59,684 --> 01:52:02,812
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1191
01:52:04,897 --> 01:52:08,129
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1192
01:52:44,934 --> 01:52:47,541
I was in the library the other night...

1193
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:49,939
...in the Restricted Section...

1194
01:52:50,773 --> 01:52:54,422
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1195
01:52:55,778 --> 01:52:58,489
It's called, as I understand it...

1196
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:01,095
...a Horcrux.

1197
01:53:02,972 --> 01:53:05,683
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1198
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:08,811
I came across the term while reading...

1199
01:53:08,915 --> 01:53:11,939
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1200
01:53:12,147 --> 01:53:13,816
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1201
01:53:14,024 --> 01:53:16,631
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1202
01:53:16,839 --> 01:53:18,299
Which is...

1203
01:53:19,446 --> 01:53:21,322
...why I came to you.

1204
01:53:24,138 --> 01:53:29,768
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1205
01:53:29,976 --> 01:53:32,583
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1206
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:39,152
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1207
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,905
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1208
01:53:43,114 --> 01:53:44,260
Protected?

1209
01:53:44,365 --> 01:53:47,597
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1210
01:53:49,057 --> 01:53:51,455
In other words, you cannot die.

1211
01:53:58,649 --> 01:54:01,777
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1212
01:54:01,985 --> 01:54:04,800
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1213
01:54:06,052 --> 01:54:07,511
Murder.

1214
01:54:08,033 --> 01:54:09,284
Yes.

1215
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:14,810
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1216
01:54:15,644 --> 01:54:20,440
Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1217
01:54:20,649 --> 01:54:22,108
Seven?

1218
01:54:22,838 --> 01:54:28,155
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1219
01:54:28,364 --> 01:54:32,013
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1220
01:54:33,264 --> 01:54:36,288
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1221
01:54:41,084 --> 01:54:42,335
Of course, sir.

1222
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:47,340
It'll be our little secret.

1223
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,349
Sir.

1224
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,866
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1225
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:17,785
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1226
01:55:17,889 --> 01:55:21,017
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1227
01:55:21,226 --> 01:55:22,268
What are they exactly?

1228
01:55:22,373 --> 01:55:25,709
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1229
01:55:28,941 --> 01:55:30,609
A ring, for example.

1230
01:55:31,235 --> 01:55:32,695
Or a book.

1231
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:36,448
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1232
01:55:36,969 --> 01:55:39,055
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1233
01:55:39,263 --> 01:55:41,453
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1234
01:55:41,661 --> 01:55:43,538
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1235
01:55:43,747 --> 01:55:48,751
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1236
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,941
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1237
01:55:51,358 --> 01:55:56,050
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1238
01:55:56,258 --> 01:56:00,116
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1239
01:56:00,325 --> 01:56:01,471
One destroys Voldemort.

1240
01:56:01,576 --> 01:56:04,495
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1241
01:56:04,704 --> 01:56:07,936
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1242
01:56:21,907 --> 01:56:23,784
...leaves traces.

1243
01:56:31,604 --> 01:56:33,689
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1244
01:56:33,897 --> 01:56:36,087
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1245
01:56:37,025 --> 01:56:40,049
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1246
01:56:40,258 --> 01:56:44,324
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1247
01:56:45,888 --> 01:56:50,475
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1248
01:56:54,542 --> 01:56:56,731
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1249
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:59,546
...that you take too much for granted?

1250
01:56:59,755 --> 01:57:04,759
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1251
01:57:04,968 --> 01:57:07,053
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1252
01:57:07,992 --> 01:57:13,726
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1253
01:57:32,181 --> 01:57:33,745
Oh, Harry.

1254
01:57:36,351 --> 01:57:38,645
You need a shave, my friend.

1255
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,735
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1256
01:57:45,839 --> 01:57:49,801
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1257
01:57:51,365 --> 01:57:53,763
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1258
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,744
I'm an old man.

1259
01:57:55,849 --> 01:57:57,517
You still look the same to me, sir.

1260
01:57:58,977 --> 01:58:02,000
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1261
01:58:02,209 --> 01:58:05,337
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1262
01:58:08,152 --> 01:58:12,635
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1263
01:58:12,844 --> 01:58:16,284
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1264
01:58:16,493 --> 01:58:18,265
But there is one condition:

1265
01:58:18,474 --> 01:58:21,706
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1266
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:24,208
Yes, sir.

1267
01:58:24,417 --> 01:58:26,502
You do understand what I'm saying?

1268
01:58:27,128 --> 01:58:29,526
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1269
01:58:29,734 --> 01:58:32,028
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1270
01:58:32,237 --> 01:58:36,199
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1271
01:58:41,412 --> 01:58:42,976
Your word, Harry.

1272
01:58:44,644 --> 01:58:46,104
My word.

1273
01:58:46,938 --> 01:58:48,606
Take my arm.

1274
01:58:50,066 --> 01:58:52,464
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1275
01:58:53,089 --> 01:58:56,530
Well, being me has its privileges.

1276
01:59:43,866 --> 01:59:45,430
This is the place.

1277
01:59:46,264 --> 01:59:47,828
Oh, yes.

1278
01:59:48,766 --> 01:59:51,269
This place has known magic.

1279
01:59:59,297 --> 02:00:00,861
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1280
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,425
...payment must be made.

1281
02:00:02,633 --> 02:00:06,282
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1282
02:00:07,846 --> 02:00:09,619
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1283
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:12,851
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1284
02:00:34,746 --> 02:00:39,334
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1285
02:00:39,543 --> 02:00:42,879
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1286
02:00:45,486 --> 02:00:46,841
Careful.

1287
02:01:10,405 --> 02:01:11,552
There it is.

1288
02:01:13,011 --> 02:01:15,722
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1289
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:39,703
If you would, Harry.

1290
02:02:27,038 --> 02:02:29,436
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1291
02:02:30,062 --> 02:02:31,418
Oh, yes.

1292
02:02:42,574 --> 02:02:44,138
It has to be drunk.

1293
02:02:44,346 --> 02:02:47,161
All of it has to be drunk.

1294
02:02:47,995 --> 02:02:51,332
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1295
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,938
This potion might paralyze me.

1296
02:02:54,356 --> 02:02:56,024
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1297
02:02:56,754 --> 02:03:00,090
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1298
02:03:00,299 --> 02:03:02,280
You are not to indulge these requests.

1299
02:03:02,384 --> 02:03:05,929
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1300
02:03:06,137 --> 02:03:08,535
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1301
02:03:09,057 --> 02:03:11,142
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1302
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:16,772
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1303
02:03:20,734 --> 02:03:22,715
Your good health, Harry.

1304
02:03:38,876 --> 02:03:40,232
Professor.

1305
02:03:42,317 --> 02:03:43,568
Professor!

1306
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:51,701
Harry.

1307
02:03:51,909 --> 02:03:54,411
Professor, can you hear me?

1308
02:03:55,663 --> 02:03:56,809
Professor.

1309
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:13,387
No. Don't.

1310
02:04:13,596 --> 02:04:15,890
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

1311
02:04:25,169 --> 02:04:27,046
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

1312
02:04:27,254 --> 02:04:31,633
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

1313
02:04:31,842 --> 02:04:33,927
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

1314
02:04:34,136 --> 02:04:36,325
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1315
02:04:38,306 --> 02:04:39,349
It's my fault.

1316
02:04:41,017 --> 02:04:42,268
It's all my fault.

1317
02:04:44,145 --> 02:04:45,709
It's my fault.

1318
02:04:45,918 --> 02:04:49,254
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

1319
02:04:49,984 --> 02:04:52,278
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1320
02:04:52,486 --> 02:04:54,259
- I promise.
- No.

1321
02:04:55,301 --> 02:04:56,657
Please.

1322
02:05:20,846 --> 02:05:22,306
Harry.

1323
02:05:29,396 --> 02:05:30,438
Water.

1324
02:05:31,481 --> 02:05:32,628
Water.

1325
02:05:32,732 --> 02:05:34,504
Water.

1326
02:05:41,073 --> 02:05:42,846
You did it, sir.

1327
02:05:43,054 --> 02:05:44,514
Look.

1328
02:05:46,495 --> 02:05:47,746
Harry.

1329
02:05:49,101 --> 02:05:50,457
Water.

1330
02:05:52,229 --> 02:05:53,898
Aguamenti.

1331
02:05:54,106 --> 02:05:55,566
Water.

1332
02:06:31,745 --> 02:06:33,101
Lumos.

1333
02:07:01,565 --> 02:07:03,441
Lumos Maxima!

1334
02:07:12,929 --> 02:07:14,702
Harry.

1335
02:07:18,768 --> 02:07:19,915
Sectumsempra!

1336
02:07:20,124 --> 02:07:21,270
Harry.

1337
02:07:22,209 --> 02:07:23,773
- Stupefy!
- Harry.

1338
02:08:22,995 --> 02:08:24,246
Harry.

1339
02:08:28,312 --> 02:08:30,606
Partis Temporus!

1340
02:09:13,145 --> 02:09:16,273
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1341
02:09:57,145 --> 02:10:00,794
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1342
02:10:03,296 --> 02:10:04,652
No.

1343
02:10:05,694 --> 02:10:08,405
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1344
02:10:08,509 --> 02:10:12,054
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1345
02:10:12,263 --> 02:10:13,931
Speak to no one else.

1346
02:10:14,557 --> 02:10:16,746
Severus, Harry.

1347
02:10:22,064 --> 02:10:24,462
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1348
02:10:25,921 --> 02:10:28,945
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1349
02:10:29,049 --> 02:10:32,907
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1350
02:10:33,637 --> 02:10:35,305
Harry, do as I say.

1351
02:10:38,954 --> 02:10:40,205
Trust me.

1352
02:10:41,978 --> 02:10:43,438
Trust me.

1353
02:11:04,082 --> 02:11:05,854
Good evening, Draco.

1354
02:11:06,793 --> 02:11:10,233
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1355
02:11:10,442 --> 02:11:12,214
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1356
02:11:12,423 --> 02:11:16,489
I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

1357
02:11:18,575 --> 02:11:21,390
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

1358
02:11:23,892 --> 02:11:25,352
Draco...

1359
02:11:26,081 --> 02:11:29,001
...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?

1360
02:11:29,209 --> 02:11:30,982
I've done things that would shock you.

1361
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:35,257
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1362
02:11:35,465 --> 02:11:38,072
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

1363
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:39,844
Forgive me, Draco.

1364
02:11:39,949 --> 02:11:42,451
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

1365
02:11:42,659 --> 02:11:45,057
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

1366
02:11:45,162 --> 02:11:48,394
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1367
02:11:52,252 --> 02:11:54,024
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1368
02:11:54,128 --> 02:11:55,797
Expelliarmus!

1369
02:11:59,133 --> 02:12:01,531
Very good. Very good.

1370
02:12:03,304 --> 02:12:04,659
You're not alone.

1371
02:12:05,806 --> 02:12:06,849
There are others.

1372
02:12:08,934 --> 02:12:10,289
How?

1373
02:12:11,645 --> 02:12:14,251
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1374
02:12:14,981 --> 02:12:17,379
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.

1375
02:12:17,588 --> 02:12:20,507
It has a sister. A twin.

1376
02:12:20,716 --> 02:12:22,905
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

1377
02:12:23,114 --> 02:12:24,886
Ingenious.

1378
02:12:25,512 --> 02:12:26,763
Draco...

1379
02:12:26,971 --> 02:12:33,019
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1380
02:12:33,957 --> 02:12:36,877
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!

1381
02:12:37,711 --> 02:12:41,151
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1382
02:12:42,402 --> 02:12:44,071
I have to kill you.

1383
02:12:44,696 --> 02:12:46,677
Or he's gonna kill me.

1384
02:12:56,270 --> 02:12:59,815
Well, look what we have here.

1385
02:13:01,691 --> 02:13:03,881
Well done, Draco.

1386
02:13:07,530 --> 02:13:09,407
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1387
02:13:10,449 --> 02:13:12,639
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

1388
02:13:12,743 --> 02:13:17,852
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1389
02:13:18,582 --> 02:13:19,937
Do it.

1390
02:13:21,189 --> 02:13:25,359
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

1391
02:13:25,776 --> 02:13:27,236
Let me finish him in my own way.

1392
02:13:27,444 --> 02:13:30,989
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

1393
02:13:31,198 --> 02:13:33,283
This is your moment. Do it.

1394
02:13:34,847 --> 02:13:36,828
Go on, Draco.

1395
02:13:36,932 --> 02:13:39,122
Now!

1396
02:13:40,373 --> 02:13:41,729
No.

1397
02:13:53,615 --> 02:13:55,179
Severus.

1398
02:14:04,145 --> 02:14:05,605
Please.

1399
02:14:06,648 --> 02:14:07,899
Avada Kedavra.

1400
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:54,192
Yeah!

1401
02:15:12,334 --> 02:15:15,774
Hagrid! Hello?

1402
02:15:15,983 --> 02:15:20,049
Snape! He trusted you!

1403
02:15:24,324 --> 02:15:25,992
Go on.

1404
02:15:26,618 --> 02:15:28,390
Incarcerous.

1405
02:15:28,494 --> 02:15:31,205
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1406
02:15:32,874 --> 02:15:36,001
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1407
02:15:56,229 --> 02:15:57,584
Sectumsempra!

1408
02:16:06,029 --> 02:16:11,243
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1409
02:16:12,077 --> 02:16:13,224
Yes.

1410
02:16:13,953 --> 02:16:18,020
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1411
02:20:06,149 --> 02:20:07,608
McGONAGALL:
Potter...

1412
02:20:08,338 --> 02:20:10,736
...in light of what has happened...

1413
02:20:12,196 --> 02:20:15,532
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1414
02:20:17,513 --> 02:20:21,475
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

1415
02:20:23,352 --> 02:20:25,750
...you meant a great deal to him.

1416
02:20:43,996 --> 02:20:46,186
Do you think he would've done it?

1417
02:20:46,394 --> 02:20:48,271
Draco?

1418
02:20:49,314 --> 02:20:50,669
No.

1419
02:20:51,816 --> 02:20:53,901
No, he was lowering his wand.

1420
02:20:54,944 --> 02:20:56,821
In the end, it was Snape.

1421
02:20:57,551 --> 02:20:59,949
It was always Snape.

1422
02:21:00,157 --> 02:21:02,347
And I did nothing.

1423
02:21:09,020 --> 02:21:10,375
It's fake.

1424
02:21:12,043 --> 02:21:13,294
Open it.

1425
02:21:24,346 --> 02:21:28,308
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...

1426
02:21:28,517 --> 02:21:32,166
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1427
02:21:33,209 --> 02:21:37,066
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

1428
02:21:37,275 --> 02:21:40,299
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

1429
02:21:40,507 --> 02:21:42,697
...you will be mortal once more.

1430
02:21:44,052 --> 02:21:45,616
R.A.B."

1431
02:21:46,972 --> 02:21:48,327
R.A.B.

1432
02:21:48,744 --> 02:21:49,995
Don't know.

1433
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:54,687
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1434
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:57,189
Which means it was all a waste.

1435
02:21:58,545 --> 02:22:00,004
All of it.

1436
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:08,346
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1437
02:22:08,867 --> 02:22:10,327
You and Ginny.

1438
02:22:10,952 --> 02:22:14,706
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1439
02:22:16,061 --> 02:22:18,042
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1440
02:22:19,189 --> 02:22:21,900
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1441
02:22:22,108 --> 02:22:24,923
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1442
02:22:25,132 --> 02:22:28,677
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

1443
02:22:30,032 --> 02:22:32,639
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1444
02:22:32,848 --> 02:22:35,558
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1445
02:22:38,582 --> 02:22:40,772
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

1446
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:43,378
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1447
02:22:47,653 --> 02:22:49,217
You need us, Harry.

1448
02:23:05,065 --> 02:23:08,193
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
