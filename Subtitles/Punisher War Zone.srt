<i>First and 10 on the New York 32.</i>
<i>Malone hands off for a one-yard gain.</i>

00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:37,582
<i>Can't establish their running game</i>

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,665
- <i>reputed crime boss Gaitano Cesare...</i>

8
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:52,007
<i>... once again avoided prison when</i>
<i>a mistrial was declared today...</i>

9
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:54,300
<i>... in his eight-week long</i>
<i>RICO prosecution.</i>

10
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:57,170
<i>Allegedly responsible</i>
<i>for over 200 murders...</i>

11

<i>... Cesare has yet to spend one day</i>
<i>behind bars.</i>

12
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:02,041
<i>Mr. Eugene Gordlock...</i>

13
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:05,650
<i>... a witness who repeatedly asked</i>
<i>the judge to be recused from the case...</i>

14
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:08,252
<i>... was gunned down</i>
<i>just a few hours earlier.</i>

15
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:12,186
<i>We had the opportunity to speak</i>
<i>with Mr. Gordlock's mother.</i>

16
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:46,584
<i>They shot him right in our front yard.</i>

17
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:49,516
<i>My dear, sweet little boy.</i>

18
00:02:49,723 --> 00:02:51,452
<i>The pained words</i>
<i>of a grieving woman...</i>

19
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:55,424
<i>... left all alone in a city outraged</i>
<i>by these developments.</i>

20
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,620
<i>But with no concrete evidence</i>
<i>of tampering...</i>

21
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:59,526
<i>... and with Mr. Gordlock</i>
<i>now dead...</i>

22
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,975
Do I fix your makeup for you?

23
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:50,975
- What?
- Here's Billy the Beaut.

24
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:57,481
The captain should have sent me
out here with 30, 40 men...

25
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:01,320
...to raze this bloody get-out-of-jail party.
Instead, I'm stuck here with you.

26
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:03,723
Well, he might come out tonight.

27
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:06,455
As a matter of fact,
I'm sure he'll show up.

28
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,395
And what are you gonna do?

29
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,261
I'm gonna bring him in.

30
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:16,569
You know, you kill me, Soap. Let's just
say if you can make this happen...

31
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:18,869
...why would you?

32
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,239
He does to those bastards...

33
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:22,574
...what me and you
can only fantasize about.

34
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:25,676
Ink, keep your nose clean.

35
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:27,284
Yeah.

36
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:29,819
Sure thing, Pops.

37
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:37,192
Hey.

38
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:40,363
Look, you know, it's just...

39
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,868
- Take it easy in there, okay?
- Nicky, what am I gonna do?

40
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:46,698
Give the old guy a heart attack?

41
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:56,782
- Go on, beat it.
- Give me <i>uno minuto.</i>

42
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,979
You handled
the witness situation perfectly.

43
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:06,985
No sweat, Uncle G.

44
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:12,390
- You look great.
- The hell I do.

45
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,362
I shit in a bag, for chrissake.

46
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:17,297
Hey, saves you a trip to the can, right?

47
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:20,871
You came to discuss a private matter.

48
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:22,333
Down at the docks!

49
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,066
Right. Yeah. Cristu Bulat.

50
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:27,144
I hear he's a sick fuck.
Fresh off the boat.

51
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:30,544
Cristu's bringing in a shipment
and he needs a safe port.

52
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,719
I've arranged for my customs guy
Simmons to be on that night.

53
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,616
The union boys'll be there to unload.
Our cut's 10 mil.

54
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:39,758
- We won't break a sweat.
- Ten mil?

55
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:43,459
- Fuck's Cristu shipping?
- I don't know.

56
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,162
It's some kind of biological package.

57
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,163
A biological package.

58
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:50,700
I fucking knew it.

59
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:53,429
Probably going up to the ragheads
in Queens.

60
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,736
- Cristu guaranteed it's leaving the city.
- We don't touch that kind of shit.

61
00:05:57,944 --> 00:06:00,538
In case your memory's going
with your bodily functions...

62
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:03,045
...you might remember
I'm the top earner here.

63
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:05,740
- I'm not stupid.
- Stupid?

64
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:11,447
You're as shithouse crazy
as your brother, Loony Bin Jim.

65
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:14,525
I should have had the both of you
locked away.

66
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:17,253
One more word
about my brother, I swear to Christ I'll...

67
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:20,699
You'll what?
You make one move, you greasy fuck.

68
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,232
Hey, let's just all calm down here,
okay?

69
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,070
I've put out a big spread out here.

70
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:32,472
So come on, boys, eat up.

71
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:40,250
We're not eating with the old shitbag,
understand?

72
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:43,112
Pittsy, pour me a drink.

73
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,056
What the fuck?

74
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:35,266
Pittsy!

75
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:24,380
Let's go.

76
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,720
All right, let's split up.

77
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,394
Shouldn't we wait for backup?

78
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:17,709
Police! Freeze!

79
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:29,344
Listen, Billy Russoti's getting away.

80
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:31,022
Silver Rover.

81
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:33,488
You might wanna head down
to the docks first.

82
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:45,733
Shit, that hurts.

83
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:51,135
- What happened to you?
- Your Punisher.

84
00:09:51,344 --> 00:09:54,677
He disarmed me, held me at gunpoint
then he stole our damn ride.

85
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:57,111
- Where were you, huh?
- I knew he would come.

86
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:59,842
Hey, let me get your statement.

87
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:02,613
Come on, Saffiotti, tell me everything...

88
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:04,687
How did it go down, huh?

89
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:31,333
<i>I'm sorry about your family, Billy.</i>

90
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:36,345
- <i>Well, maybe it's a blessing in disguise.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

91
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:38,608
It was time for me to take over anyway.

92
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:42,447
Thanks to The Punisher,
I don't even get my fucking hands dirty.

93
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,321
Where's your boss, then?

94
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:50,792
- What the fuck's he doing here?
- Relax. I asked him to come.

95
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:53,829
My man. How are you doing?

96
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:57,730
- Who the fuck are these <i>finooks?</i>
- These are couple of my colleagues.

97
00:11:57,937 --> 00:12:00,701
They are very, very gifted delivery men.

98
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:05,207
No mountain too high,
no river too deep.

99
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:08,744
All right, all right, all right, enough.

100
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:11,576
- Pittsy, get me some money.
- Time to go to work.

101
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:12,978
We're running low, boss.

102
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:15,780
We picked up 200K
from the Lucciano construction site.

103
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:19,549
I had to launder it through the Pussycat
Lounge. Like you told me, remember?

104
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,057
Well, bring it back tomorrow.

105
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:24,092
- You got it, boss.
- Here.

106
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:27,494
That's 20 rolls of hundreds,
that's a grand each. All counted.

107
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,327
Head for the port, do your thing...

108
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,935
<i>... get over the security fence,</i>
<i>hand out the money.</i>

109
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,634
Where are you going?

110
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:39,800
Would it be all right
if I take the roof instead of the door?

111
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:42,742
- Whatever.
- You're a fucking saint.

112
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,142
Hey, what's the matter?

113
00:13:52,518 --> 00:13:53,507
Oh, fuck.

114
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,144
What the fuck was that?

115
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:57,322
Agent down. Repeat, agent down.
Fuck.

116
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:59,457
I'll check it out, boss.

117
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,765
- Pops!
- I'll take care of it. You get the guards.

118
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,266
Pittsy!

119
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:34,926
Fuck, you bastard. Fuck.
Fuck you, Castle!

120
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,053
Come on, Castle!

121
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,766
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you, Castle, you fucking...

122
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:50,105
Fuck you, Castle! Fuck!
My fucking face!

123
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:53,244
Pittsy! Pittsy! Pittsy!

124
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:56,277
Fuck, my fucking face!

125
00:14:56,482 --> 00:15:00,885
Fuck! Pittsy! Pittsy! Pittsy!

126
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:02,952
There he is!

127
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,118
Move! Move! Move!

128
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:09,954
Up there!

129
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:11,753
Move!

130
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,703
Up there!

131
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,441
Fuck!

132
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:29,976
Up there!

133
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:56,131
- FBI. Drop your weapons.
- Oh, shit. Shit.

134
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:58,867
You two, up the stairs.
Team 1, on me.

135
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:00,434
Don't move!

136
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:03,308
FBI! Put your weapons down.

137
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:02,992
We got a live one!

138
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:05,432
Take care of those
five yards in every direction.

139
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:07,096
Billy the Beaut.

140
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:09,274
Yo, you say Billy the Beaut?

141
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:12,505
- Not anymore, huh?
- Bring him down, maybe he'll live.

142
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:17,980
- Wait a minute.
- <i>Repeat, Nicholas Donatelli Jr.</i>

143
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:22,985
<i>Reach Donatelli's family.</i>
<i>Can you ask Miller if...</i>

144
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:26,590
The Lord is compassion and love.

145
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:30,353
Slow to anger and rich in mercy.

146
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:33,464
He does not treat us
according to our sins...

147
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,635
...nor repay us according to our faults.

148
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,532
As parents have compassion
on their children...

149
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:42,866
...the Lord has pity on those
who fear him.

150
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:47,603
For he knows of what we are made,
he remembers that we are dust.

151
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:51,807
As for us, our days are like grass.

152
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:54,508
We flower like the flower of the field.

153
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,252
The wind blows and we are gone.

154
00:18:57,456 --> 00:19:00,653
And our place never sees us again.

155
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm so sorry for your loss.

156
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:13,369
Thank you.

157
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:26,783
Who compromised Donatelli?

158
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:29,250
Calm down, Budiansky,
it wasn't anybody's fault.

159
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:32,913
None of us could foresee Castle opening
up hunting season on La Cosa Nostra.

160
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,149
Come on.

161
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,954
All right, look,
Donatelli sent us a message.

162
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:40,256
Said something big was gonna happen.
He asked for Homeland Security.

163
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:42,195
We ran 24-hour surveillance
on Russoti.

164
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:45,898
Just as we're about to find out
what is happening, Donatelli got shot.

165
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:48,505
Believe me,
no one is more pissed off than I am.

166
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:50,675
How is it we're not all over
Frank Castle?

167
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:53,310
Because we have
a real national security threat.

168
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:57,881
And the last time I checked, that tops
trying to nab some crazed vigilante.

169
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,410
Go.

170
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:06,382
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,319
I'm gonna get this guy, Angie.

172
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:11,420
I promise you.

173
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:51,160
I heard the bureau
was sending a babysitter.

174
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:52,691
Liaison.

175
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:56,026
Thirty years on the force,
I still don't know what that word means.

176
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:59,966
We have a certain way of doing things
here, Special Agent Budiansky.

177
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:02,299
Like letting mass murderers run free?

178
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,541
Four years
this Punisher's been wreaking havoc.

179
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,804
And you haven't once caught a break.

180
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:12,950
I'm waist deep in shit around here
as you can plainly see.

181
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,986
Your buddies from the bureau
told me...

182
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:17,883
...the city
is under some kind of terror threat.

183
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,489
New Yorkers are a bit sensitive
about that, if you know what I mean.

184
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:23,423
I've got my men trying to find out...

185
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:26,097
...what your colleague came across
when he went under.

186
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:31,392
Maybe if you feds allowed us in on your
undercover operations once in a while...

187
00:22:31,603 --> 00:22:35,767
...all of this could have been avoided.
- With all due respect, captain...

188
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:37,373
...that...

189
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:38,765
...is bullshit.

190
00:22:40,012 --> 00:22:41,980
What if it had been your man
lying there?

191
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:44,342
In a pool of his own blood?

192
00:22:45,284 --> 00:22:50,017
You Krispy Kreme motherfuckers would
be beating down every door in this city.

193
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:51,513
Captain.

194
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:53,521
Captain, you know what?

195
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:58,186
The Punisher Task Force
could use an extra man.

196
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:06,134
Room 12.

197
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:08,135
The basement.

198
00:23:27,126 --> 00:23:30,721
Agent Budiansky? Did I get that right?

199
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:33,454
The captain told me
you were coming in.

200
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,167
Welcome to The Punisher Task Force.

201
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:37,733
I'm Detective Martin Soap.

202
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:39,568
Pleasure.

203
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:42,131
Make yourself at home.

204
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:44,976
You have a degree
in Behavioral Psychology?

205
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:46,872
Surprised?

206
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,569
That's okay. Most people are.

207
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,913
So, what do you actually do here?

208
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,852
Here?

209
00:23:56,054 --> 00:23:58,420
This is ground zero.

210
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:02,759
I've shadowed his every step
for the last five years.

211
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:06,897
I've documented every murder
that fit his profile...

212
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:10,000
...and I've collected intelligence
on all known associates.

213
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:11,660
Take a look at this.

214
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:16,040
Six years ago...

215
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:19,836
...Frank Castle
was a Special Forces instructor.

216
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:24,343
And a simple family man.

217
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,041
One day, he takes his wife and kids
for a picnic...

218
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:30,881
...and by chance or fate,
depending on which you believe in...

219
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,950
...they witnessed a mob execution.

220
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:35,790
When they were discovered...

221
00:24:38,897 --> 00:24:40,455
But Castle survived.

222
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:48,868
Since then, he's been taking down
one crime family after another.

223
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:55,042
I'm really close, Budiansky.

224
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:58,683
Only thing getting in my way
is some bad luck.

225
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:02,219
But I have a feeling
that's about to change.

226
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:05,382
You know, I've been waiting
for someone like you.

227
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:08,588
Take a look at some of the case files.

228
00:25:08,794 --> 00:25:09,920
Get a lay of the land.

229
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:12,824
I'll get us a pie from Milano's.
Best pizza in the city.

230
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:14,656
Which drawer?

231
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:17,927
- What?
- The alleged Punisher murders.

232
00:25:19,738 --> 00:25:21,365
All of them.

233
00:25:59,077 --> 00:26:00,442
What do you want, Micro?

234
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:03,706
You ever heard of jihadi-blogger.com?

235
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,884
I'm posing
as a one-armed Wahhabi warrior...

236
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,609
...who took a crap in a cave
next to Bin Laden.

237
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,288
I think I can score you
a couple of rocket launchers.

238
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,548
What do you want?

239
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:16,450
Haven't seen you in a while.

240
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,393
Brought you some treats.

241
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,399
It's gun show season in Virginia.
No background checks, no problems.

242
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,764
That's too much, Frank.

243
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:32,235
Call it a retirement package.

244
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:36,876
I know this thing with the fed
is eating you up...

245
00:26:37,082 --> 00:26:39,175
...but that doesn't mean
you pack up your tent.

246
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:41,181
We all make mistakes, Frank.

247
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:43,650
You're fighting a war
against the assholes...

248
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:46,380
...who slip through the raindrops,
who get away with it.

249
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:49,822
In any war, there's collateral damage.
You know that.

250
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:52,326
Collateral damage?

251
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:58,935
I killed an agent in the field.

252
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:01,332
One of the good guys.

253
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:03,774
He had a family.

254
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:05,901
You didn't know.

255
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,778
I fucked up, Micro.

256
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,543
Now, please...

257
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:16,653
...just leave me alone.

258
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:35,397
Where the fuck's Nicky?

259
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:39,066
He...

260
00:27:39,277 --> 00:27:40,335
...didn't make it.

261
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:42,103
Nicky was a fucking rat.

262
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:44,077
For the feds.

263
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,618
What about my money?

264
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:51,117
We already went to his place
and tore it apart.

265
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:53,587
No sign of a safety deposit key
or nothing.

266
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,657
Does he got any next of kin?

267
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:59,422
- Somebody to carry on the family name?
- Yeah.

268
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:01,326
Something about a wife and a girl.

269
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:02,727
Good.

270
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:04,026
Let's look there.

271
00:28:04,236 --> 00:28:05,601
You got it.

272
00:28:06,104 --> 00:28:07,298
Hey, doc.

273
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:08,495
Where you been?

274
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:10,231
- Am I glad to see you.
- Hi, Billy.

275
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:13,302
Should've seen those fucking <i>brascioles</i>
at the clinic.

276
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:16,640
Must have bought their fucking
medical degrees off the Internet.

277
00:28:16,848 --> 00:28:18,543
How did you end up at a free clinic?

278
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,650
Insurance said I missed a payment.

279
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:22,342
Can you fucking believe that?

280
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:24,951
Okay. Before we do this...

281
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:28,183
...I need you to understand the severity
of your injuries.

282
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:30,791
You shouldn't have been able
to survive this.

283
00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:33,021
Well, that's why I'm here, doc.

284
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:36,132
I have the best plastic surgeon
in all of New York.

285
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:40,794
Your facial muscles, tendons,
bone structure, everything...

286
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:42,371
...was destroyed.

287
00:28:42,574 --> 00:28:45,475
And there wasn't a single square inch
of skin left intact.

288
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:47,540
Just take it off already.

289
00:28:48,547 --> 00:28:49,878
Okay.

290
00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:51,606
Let's do this.

291
00:28:52,784 --> 00:28:55,252
I'm gonna need you
to sit forward a little bit.

292
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,709
All right.

293
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:02,253
Okay.

294
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:06,095
Polymers...

295
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:14,794
...a few strategically placed
alloy plates...

296
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:20,411
...and just a little bit of horse hide.

297
00:29:21,046 --> 00:29:22,638
A little bit of what?

298
00:29:34,593 --> 00:29:37,187
I need to talk to my doctor alone.

299
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:40,296
Yeah. Yeah, of course, Billy.

300
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,937
The fuck's the matter with you?
You can't control yourself?

301
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,573
You know how sensitive he is.

302
00:29:49,774 --> 00:29:53,505
I'm sorry, Pops, it's just, I've...
Have you ever seen anything so...?

303
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:54,872
Just shut the fuck up.

304
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:23,899
You okay, boss?

305
00:30:24,843 --> 00:30:26,310
Much better. Thanks.

306
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:42,059
I'll be in the car.

307
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,160
No more distractions.

308
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:54,929
We need to focus on my goals.

309
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,539
One:

310
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:59,204
We need to get my money back.

311
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:02,175
Two, we're gonna get rid
of Frank Castle.

312
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,473
But he took out, like, 30 of us.

313
00:31:04,683 --> 00:31:07,709
I mean, how are we gonna kill him
before he'll kill us?

314
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,546
My brother will take care of that.

315
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,619
- Loony Bin Jim?
- Shut the fuck up.

316
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:14,891
His name is James.

317
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:18,995
Not Loony Bin Jim, not LBJ. James.

318
00:31:19,197 --> 00:31:21,131
I'm sorry. It's a good idea.

319
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,665
Really, it is.

320
00:31:24,402 --> 00:31:25,391
Don't mind him.

321
00:31:25,604 --> 00:31:29,335
He doesn't think before he talks,
just like his mother.

322
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:30,803
Sorry about that, Billy.

323
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,701
Billy is dead.

324
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:35,913
From now on...

325
00:31:36,314 --> 00:31:38,714
...you call me Jigsaw.

326
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:47,281
He's mine.

327
00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:50,318
Hey, Billy, fuck you!

328
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,752
Daddy!

329
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:09,997
How are we doing today,
Loony Bin Jim?

330
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:25,486
Yummy, yummy.

331
00:33:29,928 --> 00:33:32,863
So good.

332
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:37,765
- What?
- Dr. Basner. Open up!

333
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:39,732
Yes, doctor.

334
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:00,681
Billy?

335
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:02,616
Is that you?

336
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:07,627
It is.

337
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:11,629
You look fantastic, brother.

338
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:19,877
Ink, cut these off, now.

339
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:23,706
Pittsy, go open the doors
of every other cell...

340
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:27,373
...lead everybody out the front door.
- Sure thing, Billy.

341
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:28,745
Jigsaw.

342
00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:31,685
I'll take care of this guy.

343
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,051
Oh, no, brother.

344
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,656
Fatso's mine.

345
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:39,625
Of course.

346
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,298
I'm gonna get my applesauce back.

347
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:48,165
Did you know...

348
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:52,742
...kidneys and applesauce
are a delicacy in Sweden?

349
00:34:54,646 --> 00:34:56,011
Did you know that?

350
00:34:56,848 --> 00:34:57,906
Yes.

351
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:05,883
Yummy, yummy, yummy
in my tummy, tummy, tummy.

352
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:09,653
No.

353
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,723
What do you say, boss?

354
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,959
- Stuff might come in handy.
- What for?

355
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:23,305
Well, in case he starts,
you know, not feeling so good.

356
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:30,242
I think he's doing just great.

357
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:04,906
You're in my light.

358
00:36:17,195 --> 00:36:19,425
For the next time
someone gets in your light.

359
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,706
Step the fuck away from my little girl.

360
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,241
Mom, that's a dad word.

361
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:34,502
Go inside, Grace.

362
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:43,845
You're messing with the wrong family
on the wrong day, asshole.

363
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:49,417
You, you're...

364
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:51,895
What are you doing here?

365
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,223
What makes you think
you could come here?

366
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:56,491
- You'll scare the girl.
- Shut up.

367
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:57,690
Shut your mouth.

368
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:02,869
- I'm sorry.
- I said shut up.

369
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:07,040
What's this?

370
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:09,474
Something to help out.

371
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:11,112
No.

372
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,284
No, you don't get to do that.

373
00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:17,147
You don't get to shoot my husband
in cold blood and then stop at the ATM.

374
00:37:17,455 --> 00:37:18,717
It's for your daughter.

375
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:23,260
This is what you deserve.

376
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:25,122
What you did to Nick.

377
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:31,066
Who punishes you?

378
00:37:34,472 --> 00:37:36,599
He taught you how to shoot.

379
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,366
A good agent keeps his family safe...

380
00:37:40,578 --> 00:37:42,876
...but he couldn't always be here.

381
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:47,349
He took you out to the range.

382
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:49,481
He showed you what to do.

383
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:55,090
This is where you do it.

384
00:37:57,929 --> 00:37:59,726
Squeeze...

385
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:01,426
...don't pull.

386
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,308
I can't find my red pen.

387
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:21,710
Mom, I need it.

388
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,085
You take it.

389
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:14,399
Is this it, boss?

390
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:15,731
Yeah.

391
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,771
Nice, brother.

392
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:20,170
- Is it yours?
- Not yet.

393
00:39:20,378 --> 00:39:23,404
Old Cesare used to rent it
to screw hookers.

394
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:26,879
Let's go inside
before I freeze my fucking balls off.

395
00:39:44,836 --> 00:39:46,201
What's the matter, Billy?

396
00:39:47,538 --> 00:39:50,234
Just when I think I'm okay...

397
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:52,572
...I see my reflection somewhere...

398
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,979
...and I look horrible.

399
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:01,281
What has he done to me?

400
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:03,313
No, no, no, don't.

401
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:05,284
Don't cry, brother.

402
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,220
Everything is gonna be all right.

403
00:40:08,426 --> 00:40:11,054
I promise you two things:

404
00:40:11,262 --> 00:40:13,992
One, I will find Castle...

405
00:40:14,198 --> 00:40:19,295
...and I will kill him slowly and painfully.

406
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:26,171
And two, you will never, ever
have to look at your reflection again...

407
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:29,107
...as long as you're with me.

408
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:39,207
You're not in Transylvania anymore,
Cristu.

409
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:41,044
We don't talk vampire.

410
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:43,243
It's Russian.

411
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,021
My man is concerned.

412
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:51,559
If Punisher can do this to your face...

413
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:53,195
...what might he do to our deal?

414
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:58,029
The tongue stretches further
than most people think.

415
00:41:58,236 --> 00:42:01,535
Ask your man
how he's gonna talk that shit...

416
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:03,263
...when I pull it from his mouth.

417
00:42:06,444 --> 00:42:07,741
Enough.

418
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,038
The Punisher is not a problem.

419
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:12,216
The docks are mine.

420
00:42:12,683 --> 00:42:15,516
My looks have nothing to do with this.

421
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,312
Everybody...

422
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:21,287
...from the local security
to international customs is in my pocket.

423
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:26,528
Quite frankly, this job doesn't get done
without me.

424
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:09,700
My most sincere apologies.

425
00:43:09,907 --> 00:43:13,399
My father always say
never insult your host.

426
00:43:14,345 --> 00:43:15,778
Sounds like a reasonable man.

427
00:43:17,148 --> 00:43:19,616
You don't know of my father.

428
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,554
Three days.

429
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:30,593
It has to be 12 million.

430
00:43:33,965 --> 00:43:35,125
We agree on 10.

431
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:36,758
We both know...

432
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:41,166
...that this biological shit
you're bringing in isn't leaving the city.

433
00:43:42,173 --> 00:43:45,438
You're selling it
to the ragheads in Queens.

434
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:48,367
The ports have been crawling
with suits from Homeland.

435
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:51,104
Gonna take a lot of payola
to keep it quiet.

436
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:05,686
Always knew you'd be a good boss,
Billy.

437
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:07,488
Thanks, brother.

438
00:44:49,974 --> 00:44:51,271
Latin Kings.

439
00:44:52,743 --> 00:44:54,108
Let him go, Frank.

440
00:44:54,311 --> 00:44:55,573
You know this piece of shit?

441
00:44:56,013 --> 00:44:57,412
Ex piece of shit.

442
00:44:57,615 --> 00:44:58,912
Yeah.

443
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:00,947
He's a regular choirboy.

444
00:45:01,152 --> 00:45:03,120
- Fuck you, cracker.
- Language.

445
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:04,851
It's a genius racket.

446
00:45:05,056 --> 00:45:07,684
You know how the cops
always run those gun buy-backs?

447
00:45:07,892 --> 00:45:09,587
Except they never work.

448
00:45:09,794 --> 00:45:13,594
Because what banger
is gonna trust a cop, right?

449
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:17,564
Well, these drive-by wack jobs,
they just love Carlos here.

450
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:20,299
They get one look at that ink...

451
00:45:20,504 --> 00:45:22,165
...and they know he's for real.

452
00:45:22,373 --> 00:45:26,036
We get the guns off the street to you.

453
00:45:26,243 --> 00:45:29,076
Never once seen a banger
that could quit.

454
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,747
Too fucking stupid.

455
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:33,609
He's straight, Frank.

456
00:45:35,386 --> 00:45:37,877
Hey, Mom, Frank's here.

457
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:40,751
He says eat up, huh?

458
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:42,050
How's she doing?

459
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,789
Yeah, well.

460
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:50,294
As long as she's got her cooking shows,
she's good.

461
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:51,934
It's the only thing she notices.

462
00:45:52,436 --> 00:45:54,597
But, hey, that's something, right?

463
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,172
Listen, I...

464
00:46:00,711 --> 00:46:04,112
I just came around to tell you
that I'm going out of town for a while.

465
00:46:04,315 --> 00:46:06,146
Out of town?

466
00:46:10,654 --> 00:46:12,349
I'm sorry.

467
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,754
I never thought of The Punisher
taking a long weekend.

468
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:17,956
I'm not planning on coming back.

469
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:22,688
So I take it things didn't go so well
at the Donatelli home?

470
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:27,629
Are you aware
that Billy Russoti survived?

471
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:29,866
I heard.

472
00:46:31,809 --> 00:46:33,674
Let the cops take care of him.

473
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:36,108
You and I know
they got nothing on him.

474
00:46:36,313 --> 00:46:39,146
Their hands are tied.
This is where The Punisher comes in.

475
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,376
This is why I believe in you,
why I supported you all these years.

476
00:46:42,586 --> 00:46:45,714
You want me to tell you when
something happens to Mrs. Donatelli?

477
00:46:45,923 --> 00:46:47,356
That's what's gonna happen.

478
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:49,492
You don't think
he's gonna go for revenge?

479
00:46:49,693 --> 00:46:52,423
It's not a question of if,
it's a matter of when.

480
00:47:02,806 --> 00:47:04,569
- Pull a couple of Berettas.
- For what?

481
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:08,769
Three...

482
00:47:08,979 --> 00:47:09,968
...two...

483
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:11,705
...one.

484
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:17,314
Russoti is the last one, then I'm done.

485
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:18,852
From your lips to God's ears.

486
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,555
You know where I can find him?

487
00:47:20,758 --> 00:47:22,555
I don't have a fix on him.

488
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,160
You wiped out his associates
that are known to me.

489
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:26,852
I saw him with some new guys.

490
00:47:27,064 --> 00:47:29,692
Leader was black, dreadlocks.

491
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,868
Did some acrobatic stuff over the roofs.

492
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:34,162
That's Maginty
and his urban free-flow gang.

493
00:47:34,371 --> 00:47:36,271
He's a mean motherfucker.

494
00:47:36,473 --> 00:47:38,998
He's on a constant meth high.

495
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:47,716
Well, come on.

496
00:47:48,152 --> 00:47:50,620
You wanna find this guy or not?

497
00:47:53,757 --> 00:47:54,746
You boys play nice.

498
00:48:04,768 --> 00:48:08,727
- I've been looking for you.
- Agent Budiansky, take a load off.

499
00:48:09,073 --> 00:48:11,098
I need to go see Castle.
Where do I find him?

500
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:14,408
Rats, you know, he just left.

501
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:17,476
Wait, wait, wait.

502
00:48:17,848 --> 00:48:19,907
You know what I like to do?

503
00:48:20,251 --> 00:48:22,685
I like to sit in my car...

504
00:48:22,886 --> 00:48:26,481
...and listen to the CB radio
and follow the crime.

505
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:30,522
We might just run into him.
It's never worked for me in five years...

506
00:48:30,728 --> 00:48:33,993
...but I'm not the luckiest guy
on the planet, y'know?

507
00:48:49,713 --> 00:48:52,045
Let's go through the back door.

508
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:11,931
Maginty and his boys are planning to hit
a convenience store on 45th and 2nd.

509
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,353
<i>Suspects are armed and dangerous.</i>

510
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:34,183
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>suspects are armed and dangerous.</i>

511
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,188
Let's do this.

512
00:49:37,461 --> 00:49:38,758
Really?

513
00:49:38,962 --> 00:49:39,986
Just drive the car.

514
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:44,825
Come on. Come on.

515
00:50:18,902 --> 00:50:19,891
Oh, fuck.

516
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:34,406
Please.

517
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:35,880
Please.

518
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,482
- Don't kill me.
- Russoti.

519
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,521
- Where is he?
- Your man, Jigsaw.

520
00:50:41,725 --> 00:50:45,058
I was just with him. He was supposed
to give me some dough for a job.

521
00:50:45,262 --> 00:50:46,991
But turns out...

522
00:50:48,098 --> 00:50:50,191
...he don't have any anymore.

523
00:50:50,401 --> 00:50:54,667
He forgot he gave a whole bunch
to that FBI rat bastard.

524
00:50:54,872 --> 00:50:59,639
So he went to go see
Donatelli's wee bitch to get it back.

525
00:51:01,512 --> 00:51:03,605
Something for something.

526
00:51:03,947 --> 00:51:05,471
Mr. Punisher, sir.

527
00:51:10,454 --> 00:51:12,854
So when did Donattelli go undercover?

528
00:51:13,056 --> 00:51:14,819
We were partners in narcotics.

529
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:19,621
Unfortunately, most of the blow
we confiscated ended up in my nose.

530
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:23,132
Internal Affairs
tried to get Nicky to rat me out.

531
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,322
He wouldn't.

532
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:26,662
So they send him undercover.

533
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:30,299
He's dead because of me.

534
00:51:33,377 --> 00:51:35,436
So you still skiing the old alps?

535
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,072
No.

536
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:40,341
That's in the past.

537
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,519
- Holy shit.
- Shit.

538
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:00,295
Drive around,
meet me on the other side.

539
00:52:24,828 --> 00:52:26,489
Mommy.

540
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,065
Hello, Mrs. Donatelli.

541
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:34,499
Or will you be calling yourself Miss
from now on?

542
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:35,865
What do you want from us?

543
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:37,700
I'm looking for my money...

544
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:40,308
...which your rat of a husband
stole from me.

545
00:52:40,511 --> 00:52:42,001
We don't have it, I swear to God.

546
00:52:46,483 --> 00:52:48,075
How about you, sweetcheeks?

547
00:52:48,285 --> 00:52:51,083
Would you also like to swear
on an imaginary friend?

548
00:52:54,124 --> 00:52:55,785
Make sure they don't move.

549
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:58,223
- We'll look for the money.
- Hey, kid.

550
00:53:03,233 --> 00:53:04,222
Freeze, asshole!

551
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:06,599
You're under arrest.

552
00:53:24,922 --> 00:53:26,389
Stay out of my way.

553
00:54:17,274 --> 00:54:18,764
Listen to me.

554
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:21,809
Russoti is headed
to the Donattelli house.

555
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:24,480
He's probably already there.

556
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:26,544
You have to let me go.

557
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,344
You have the right to shut the fuck up!

558
00:54:39,896 --> 00:54:41,625
Mommy.

559
00:55:06,523 --> 00:55:09,356
Damn it. Cops.

560
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,743
- Evening, officers.
- Is everything okay in there?

561
00:55:31,148 --> 00:55:32,376
No.

562
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:34,174
Everything is not okay.

563
00:55:34,718 --> 00:55:36,652
Follow me.

564
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:45,690
Officer.

565
00:55:47,564 --> 00:55:49,054
Oh, no, you don't.

566
00:56:03,747 --> 00:56:06,079
Well, well, well.

567
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:09,684
This day was bound to come
sooner or later, wasn't it?

568
00:56:11,221 --> 00:56:13,883
Have you heard back
from the patrol car?

569
00:56:15,759 --> 00:56:17,056
Soap.

570
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:21,393
I tried a couple of times.
There was no answer.

571
00:56:30,073 --> 00:56:33,839
Listen, we gotta get out of here
before more pigs arrive.

572
00:56:35,412 --> 00:56:36,936
- No!
- Where is my fucking money?

573
00:56:37,147 --> 00:56:39,240
My husband has a safe
upstairs in the bedroom.

574
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:41,610
I don't know if it's there
but I can give you the combination.

575
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,115
10-12-19-65.

576
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:45,515
Oh, how cute.

577
00:56:45,722 --> 00:56:48,452
Is that your dead husband's birthday?

578
00:57:00,637 --> 00:57:02,002
Let me help you.

579
00:57:08,478 --> 00:57:11,106
- Get him to the station.
- You bet.

580
00:57:28,732 --> 00:57:30,222
Let me out.

581
00:57:32,235 --> 00:57:33,998
You know, Frank...

582
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:37,135
...throwing you a tip now and again
is one thing.

583
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,366
Password to the crime database
et cetera, but letting you go?

584
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:42,511
- Soap.
- Fine.

585
00:57:54,891 --> 00:57:56,153
How you doing?

586
00:58:10,807 --> 00:58:11,796
Nineteen.

587
00:58:18,682 --> 00:58:20,206
Fuck!

588
00:58:22,652 --> 00:58:24,381
Fuck that...

589
00:58:34,764 --> 00:58:36,391
What was that?

590
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:38,696
Go check it out.

591
00:58:41,204 --> 00:58:43,229
What the fuck are you waiting for,
Christmas?

592
00:59:11,101 --> 00:59:12,398
Now.

593
00:59:12,602 --> 00:59:14,433
You, sit down.

594
00:59:22,846 --> 00:59:24,074
I'm calling this in.

595
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:27,180
Put your hands behind your back.

596
00:59:29,552 --> 00:59:32,077
Goddamn it, Castle!

597
00:59:33,957 --> 00:59:35,925
Where do you think you're going?

598
00:59:37,627 --> 00:59:38,992
Castle!

599
00:59:43,466 --> 00:59:46,196
I repeat, request immediate backup.

600
00:59:53,777 --> 00:59:54,903
Don't worry, I'm here.

601
00:59:55,312 --> 00:59:56,745
Give me your fucking gun.

602
00:59:59,582 --> 01:00:00,571
Fuck!

603
01:00:01,952 --> 01:00:03,852
Stay right where you fucking are.

604
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:10,316
We did it, Budiansky, huh?

605
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,119
Would you mind explaining to me...

606
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:14,422
...how a handcuffed criminal
escapes custody...

607
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:17,293
...from the back of your locked car?

608
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,661
That Castle's a slippery one.

609
01:00:32,782 --> 01:00:34,215
You'll be safe here.

610
01:00:35,585 --> 01:00:37,382
We can manage on our own.

611
01:00:37,587 --> 01:00:40,249
Just until we know
Russoti's been arrested.

612
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:46,026
Grace.

613
01:00:46,229 --> 01:00:48,561
Grace, we're leaving soon, honey.

614
01:00:49,899 --> 01:00:51,696
She's smart.

615
01:00:52,302 --> 01:00:53,860
Go ahead. Open it.

616
01:01:25,802 --> 01:01:28,896
It belonged to my daughter.

617
01:01:30,407 --> 01:01:31,738
Here.

618
01:01:53,596 --> 01:01:55,564
Put that down, honey.

619
01:01:59,035 --> 01:02:00,434
It...

620
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,965
...was Lisa's favorite toy.

621
01:02:04,274 --> 01:02:08,108
She got so angry when her little brother
used to hide it from her.

622
01:02:08,678 --> 01:02:10,543
Does she care if I play with it?

623
01:02:12,849 --> 01:02:14,214
No.

624
01:02:32,535 --> 01:02:35,470
You're gonna fry
for killing two of my officers, Billy.

625
01:02:35,672 --> 01:02:39,199
- I want a lawyer.
- Oh, you'll get your fucking lawyer.

626
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:41,637
But no lawyer's gonna get you
out of this one...

627
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:43,073
...you ugly piece of shit.

628
01:03:01,898 --> 01:03:03,798
Agent Miller, what are you doing here?

629
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,324
Russoti.

630
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:08,868
- What's he got to do with the bureau?
- The case Donatelli was working on.

631
01:03:09,072 --> 01:03:12,007
He says he's got some intel,
he wants to make a deal.

632
01:03:12,308 --> 01:03:13,900
Anyone know where he is right now?

633
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:17,079
- Brought him into the observation room.
- Good.

634
01:03:19,949 --> 01:03:20,938
Yeah?

635
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:22,914
Captain, Agent Miller from the bureau.

636
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,747
I believe you were informed
I'll be taking over this?

637
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,389
This perp killed two of my officers...

638
01:03:31,594 --> 01:03:35,086
...and terrorized the widow and child
of one of your agents.

639
01:03:35,298 --> 01:03:37,789
You keep that in mind, Miller.

640
01:03:43,173 --> 01:03:44,970
You're lucky I came to you with this.

641
01:03:46,242 --> 01:03:47,709
That I'm a patriot.

642
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:49,606
Just like you.

643
01:03:49,879 --> 01:03:51,346
I shit red, white and blue.

644
01:03:51,548 --> 01:03:53,982
The reason you came to me
is because you got caught.

645
01:03:54,184 --> 01:03:56,015
So don't insult my intelligence, okay?

646
01:03:56,619 --> 01:03:58,086
You tell me what you know.

647
01:03:58,288 --> 01:03:59,619
If it's any good...

648
01:03:59,822 --> 01:04:02,188
...I'll recommend life without parole.

649
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:07,121
This deal is going down tonight.

650
01:04:09,532 --> 01:04:12,092
I know when and I know where.

651
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:16,370
So you're gonna give me
and my brother here the immunity...

652
01:04:16,573 --> 01:04:18,268
...and the money...

653
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:22,540
...or you're gonna have to explain
to Wolf fucking Blitzer...

654
01:04:22,745 --> 01:04:26,772
...why you had the lead on the thing
that killed half the fucking city...

655
01:04:26,983 --> 01:04:29,952
...and you didn't do
a goddamn thing about it.

656
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,849
I'll be right back.

657
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:37,759
Oh, and Miller?

658
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:40,259
There's just one other little thing.

659
01:05:46,262 --> 01:05:47,889
Happy?

660
01:05:57,006 --> 01:05:58,303
Go, go, go.

661
01:05:58,775 --> 01:05:59,799
Get them alive.

662
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:02,500
Homeland Security, put your weapons
on the ground.

663
01:06:02,712 --> 01:06:04,509
Do it now!

664
01:06:05,748 --> 01:06:07,238
You're a fucking dead man.

665
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:10,078
My father will kill you, you hear me?

666
01:06:10,286 --> 01:06:12,948
My father will serve your head
on a fucking silver platter.

667
01:06:13,389 --> 01:06:15,186
Walk down to your right.

668
01:06:16,426 --> 01:06:18,053
Stand clear.

669
01:06:18,261 --> 01:06:19,489
Agent Miller.

670
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:21,820
As agreed.

671
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:24,362
The other condition of our agreement?

672
01:06:25,134 --> 01:06:26,829
Clear the area.

673
01:06:29,172 --> 01:06:32,073
I hope to God he finds you
and you get what you deserve.

674
01:06:53,529 --> 01:06:55,656
- How long was I...?
- A long time.

675
01:06:56,165 --> 01:06:58,861
- You should eat.
- Grace.

676
01:06:59,068 --> 01:07:00,729
- What is it?
- Egg and cheese...

677
01:07:00,937 --> 01:07:02,529
...MREs, that's all I have.

678
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:04,138
What's an MRE?

679
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,638
Meal ready-to-eat.

680
01:07:06,843 --> 01:07:10,210
Military food.
It's great for people who can't cook.

681
01:07:11,013 --> 01:07:13,811
Look, Grace,
this one came with Chuckles.

682
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,612
That's the best one to get.

683
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:18,446
Not exactly a balanced breakfast.

684
01:07:18,654 --> 01:07:20,519
Out of practice.

685
01:07:23,726 --> 01:07:25,387
Not one more step.

686
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:34,362
- Where's Micro?
- His mother isn't feeling well.

687
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:36,367
- He didn't want to leave her.
- Damn it.

688
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:38,036
I need to talk to him.

689
01:07:39,108 --> 01:07:40,575
This is Carlos.

690
01:07:40,777 --> 01:07:42,301
He's...

691
01:07:42,678 --> 01:07:43,702
...a friend of mine.

692
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:47,411
He's gonna hang
while I take care of some things.

693
01:07:47,617 --> 01:07:50,245
- Hi, Carlos. I'm Grace.
- Hey, little girl.

694
01:07:50,453 --> 01:07:51,886
We're gonna be homeys, right?

695
01:07:53,456 --> 01:07:55,617
Yeah, we're gonna be tight.

696
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:57,793
This will all be over soon.

697
01:07:57,994 --> 01:07:59,791
Then you can go.

698
01:08:07,003 --> 01:08:08,971
Don't go.

699
01:08:24,287 --> 01:08:26,278
I need you alert.

700
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:29,954
Don't make me regret this.

701
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:41,170
That was fun.

702
01:08:41,471 --> 01:08:45,339
Now, let's go kill Castle
in his miserable hole.

703
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:47,475
No, not yet.

704
01:08:47,677 --> 01:08:50,271
We're gonna have ourselves
a little bit of fun with this.

705
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,938
Next time he has to face us
and a fucking army.

706
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:55,674
Where do we get the army from?

707
01:08:55,885 --> 01:08:58,080
Just like Uncle Sam, bro.

708
01:08:58,287 --> 01:09:00,983
We recruit in troubled neighborhoods.

709
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:03,681
Offer a hundred grand
towards a college education...

710
01:09:03,893 --> 01:09:07,522
...they'll never get and promise
nobody ever has to go to Iraq.

711
01:09:08,731 --> 01:09:11,700
Just as long as I get to kill Castle.

712
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:13,835
Don't worry, brother, you will.

713
01:09:14,036 --> 01:09:17,870
Just making damn sure this time
he don't come back breathing.

714
01:09:45,568 --> 01:09:47,331
<i>Here we have garlic, onion...</i>

715
01:09:47,537 --> 01:09:50,631
<i>... a little paprika rub</i>
<i>on a rare roast beef.</i>

716
01:10:06,556 --> 01:10:09,252
Hello, sports fans.

717
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:18,731
And how are you today, my friend?

718
01:10:19,068 --> 01:10:20,865
Run! Get out of here!

719
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:22,537
Hey.

720
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:24,535
I axed you a question.

721
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:25,729
Run!

722
01:10:29,245 --> 01:10:30,837
You don't answer.

723
01:10:31,047 --> 01:10:34,016
Guess I'll have to ax it again.

724
01:10:35,918 --> 01:10:37,545
Here I come.

725
01:11:19,028 --> 01:11:20,222
Good.

726
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:23,523
Bring them upstairs
and meet me back down here.

727
01:11:23,733 --> 01:11:27,499
Let's see if we can talk
a few poor bastards into signing up.

728
01:11:36,045 --> 01:11:37,979
Where are they?

729
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:45,883
I tried. I swear I tried.

730
01:11:46,088 --> 01:11:47,453
Goddamn it.

731
01:11:47,657 --> 01:11:49,181
Don't die on me.

732
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:51,759
I'm bleeding out.

733
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:53,451
I've seen this show before.

734
01:11:53,663 --> 01:11:54,755
Shut up, kid.

735
01:11:54,964 --> 01:11:56,158
You're gonna be fine.

736
01:11:56,365 --> 01:11:57,832
It hurts real bad.

737
01:11:58,034 --> 01:12:00,332
Hurts real bad, Frank.

738
01:12:01,337 --> 01:12:03,931
Don't let me die like this, man.

739
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,402
Not like this.

740
01:12:16,819 --> 01:12:18,150
See you in hell.

741
01:12:18,754 --> 01:12:21,120
I see you anywhere near hell...

742
01:12:21,323 --> 01:12:22,585
...I'll kick your ass out.

743
01:12:48,317 --> 01:12:49,875
I haven't seen you in ages, Frank.

744
01:12:50,853 --> 01:12:53,822
Whatever it is, it must be pretty bad.

745
01:12:54,023 --> 01:12:56,287
Maybe I'm just here
to see an old friend, Mike.

746
01:12:56,492 --> 01:12:57,925
Yeah, right.

747
01:12:58,127 --> 01:13:00,823
- I haven't seen you since...
- The funeral.

748
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:02,463
I know.

749
01:13:02,832 --> 01:13:04,424
I've been reading about you.

750
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:08,336
You've been a long a way
from the seminary, my friend.

751
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:12,498
I don't even remember that
as part of my life.

752
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:14,869
Why do you do this?

753
01:13:15,778 --> 01:13:17,541
Somebody has to punish the corrupt.

754
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:22,107
For in the same way you judge others,
you will be judged.

755
01:13:22,518 --> 01:13:26,284
And with the measure you use,
it will be measured to you.

756
01:13:28,124 --> 01:13:29,523
Matthew...

757
01:13:29,725 --> 01:13:31,488
...7:2.

758
01:13:32,928 --> 01:13:34,486
I'm okay with that.

759
01:13:35,664 --> 01:13:36,790
God be with you, Frank.

760
01:13:42,605 --> 01:13:45,301
Sometimes I'd like to get
my hands on God.

761
01:14:01,724 --> 01:14:03,589
Interesting choice for a meeting place.

762
01:14:03,793 --> 01:14:06,591
I didn't take you for a religious man,
Castle.

763
01:14:06,796 --> 01:14:08,457
Yeah, well...

764
01:14:08,731 --> 01:14:10,926
...an eye for an eye.
- If I remember right...

765
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:13,829
...they're not called
the Ten Suggestions.

766
01:14:14,603 --> 01:14:16,298
Russoti's got Angela and Grace.

767
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,337
- How?
- Doesn't matter.

768
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:22,807
Maybe if you'd put them in protective
custody like you should have...

769
01:14:23,012 --> 01:14:24,604
...we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

770
01:14:24,814 --> 01:14:26,645
They'd be dead.

771
01:14:27,249 --> 01:14:29,683
The law can't touch him, Castle.

772
01:14:30,052 --> 01:14:32,145
Total immunity.

773
01:14:32,655 --> 01:14:36,056
Unless you've got a videotape
of Russoti taking them.

774
01:14:36,325 --> 01:14:38,452
We can't even give him
a parking ticket.

775
01:14:38,661 --> 01:14:41,152
It's a fucked-up system
you're sworn to protect.

776
01:14:41,497 --> 01:14:42,862
Never said it was perfect.

777
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,294
He wants me in exchange for them.

778
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:50,294
I need you to secure the trade.

779
01:14:51,674 --> 01:14:53,141
Okay...

780
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:55,373
...but I'm doing this by the book.

781
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:58,206
What book do you think
they're going by, huh?

782
01:14:58,414 --> 01:15:00,780
I took an oath, Castle.

783
01:15:00,983 --> 01:15:04,180
- There are laws.
- No official police procedure.

784
01:15:04,386 --> 01:15:06,217
You wanna come along?

785
01:15:06,422 --> 01:15:08,515
Leave your badge at home.

786
01:15:12,061 --> 01:15:15,189
- I have to think about it.
- Clock's ticking.

787
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:39,679
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

788
01:15:39,889 --> 01:15:41,049
Relax.

789
01:15:41,257 --> 01:15:45,455
We're looking for a few good men.

790
01:15:46,128 --> 01:15:50,121
And we'd like to offer you
the opportunity to be...

791
01:15:50,332 --> 01:15:51,799
...all that you can be.

792
01:15:52,568 --> 01:15:57,801
Now, we've all suffered loss
at the hands of The Punisher.

793
01:15:58,507 --> 01:16:01,567
And because we don't
look like everybody else...

794
01:16:01,777 --> 01:16:04,940
...and because we don't act
like everybody else...

795
01:16:05,714 --> 01:16:08,046
...nobody does a goddamn thing
about it.

796
01:16:09,184 --> 01:16:10,742
Well, I say...

797
01:16:10,953 --> 01:16:15,322
...he ain't the only one who can take
the law into his own hands.

798
01:16:15,758 --> 01:16:20,786
So if you're as sick of this cocksucker
as I am...

799
01:16:20,996 --> 01:16:22,327
...raise your armies.

800
01:16:22,865 --> 01:16:24,765
You'll be well-paid...

801
01:16:24,967 --> 01:16:26,628
...you'll be well-armed...

802
01:16:28,437 --> 01:16:29,927
...and at the end of it...

803
01:16:30,139 --> 01:16:32,801
...The Punisher will be dead.

804
01:17:49,818 --> 01:17:53,686
Agent Budiansky,
just in time for happy hour.

805
01:17:55,024 --> 01:17:56,457
You need to come with me.

806
01:17:56,658 --> 01:17:57,647
Where to?

807
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,626
Your partner Frank Castle
needs help.

808
01:18:03,065 --> 01:18:05,966
"Partner" is a little bit
of an exaggeration.

809
01:18:06,402 --> 01:18:07,926
How did you know?

810
01:18:08,303 --> 01:18:10,965
Oh, usually,
unless you've arrested Houdini...

811
01:18:11,173 --> 01:18:13,573
...a handcuffed criminal
does not escape that easily.

812
01:18:13,776 --> 01:18:15,971
You know,
you're not as stupid as you...

813
01:18:16,178 --> 01:18:17,167
I didn't say that.

814
01:18:20,916 --> 01:18:23,510
- Who are we looking for?
- Cristu's father.

815
01:18:25,087 --> 01:18:27,453
I don't think this is a good idea.

816
01:18:38,767 --> 01:18:40,257
What?

817
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:42,528
We're looking for Tiberiu.
Cristu's father.

818
01:18:46,275 --> 01:18:48,209
- Why?
- If I were Tiberiu...

819
01:18:48,544 --> 01:18:50,239
...I'd probably wanna find the man...

820
01:18:50,446 --> 01:18:54,439
...who was responsible for sending
my son to prison for the rest of his life.

821
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:58,586
- And how would you do that?
- I'd tell him when and where to find him.

822
01:19:00,122 --> 01:19:01,783
What do you want from it?

823
01:19:02,891 --> 01:19:05,587
I don't like him
and I want him taken care of.

824
01:19:08,764 --> 01:19:11,324
No worries, my friend.

825
01:19:40,162 --> 01:19:41,993
All right, lock and load. Lock and load.

826
01:19:42,197 --> 01:19:44,358
- Let's knock him down.
- Get ready.

827
01:20:07,656 --> 01:20:09,521
Here they are.

828
01:20:09,892 --> 01:20:11,587
Oh, boy.

829
01:20:44,226 --> 01:20:46,558
Take it easy, James.

830
01:20:47,129 --> 01:20:48,323
He'll be here.

831
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:53,995
- You get it.
- Fuck that, man. You get it.

832
01:20:54,203 --> 01:20:55,363
I'll get it.

833
01:20:59,107 --> 01:21:02,599
- What you looking for?
- I'm here to see the Jigsaw.

834
01:21:02,811 --> 01:21:05,609
You're out of luck. No Jigsaw here.

835
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:10,144
I'm here for The Punisher party.

836
01:21:19,361 --> 01:21:21,226
Who's the old man?

837
01:21:22,397 --> 01:21:24,388
It's Cristu's father.

838
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,194
Old-country genocidal maniac.

839
01:21:27,402 --> 01:21:30,030
Figured he'd stir up a shit storm
for us.

840
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:33,640
Cops will be all over this place
once the fireworks start.

841
01:21:33,842 --> 01:21:35,207
I wouldn't worry about that.

842
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:37,640
I called in a explosives permit.

843
01:21:37,846 --> 01:21:41,612
Construction crew.
Said we'd be blasting dynamite all night.

844
01:21:41,817 --> 01:21:43,216
So...

845
01:21:43,518 --> 01:21:45,179
...what's the plan?

846
01:21:45,454 --> 01:21:47,547
I'm going in to get them.

847
01:21:49,124 --> 01:21:51,024
You call that a plan?

848
01:21:51,226 --> 01:21:53,353
It's all I need.

849
01:21:54,596 --> 01:21:56,530
Well, I'm going in with you.

850
01:21:59,067 --> 01:22:02,366
Never took the time to think about
where I was headed.

851
01:22:03,438 --> 01:22:05,906
I'm far down that road.

852
01:22:07,743 --> 01:22:09,005
You're not going there.

853
01:22:11,947 --> 01:22:13,744
Thanks, Frank.

854
01:22:13,949 --> 01:22:16,918
You know he's gonna take it out on me
when he wakes up.

855
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:21,283
If you don't hear gunfire
for longer than five minutes...

856
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:25,085
...the girls are not here,
set him loose.

857
01:24:59,181 --> 01:25:01,240
Come on, get him. Go, go, go.

858
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:40,144
Quiet, fool.

859
01:26:01,877 --> 01:26:03,003
It's time.

860
01:26:03,745 --> 01:26:05,838
James, be careful.

861
01:26:54,529 --> 01:26:55,791
Oh, for fuck's sake.

862
01:27:28,964 --> 01:27:32,263
Won't be replacing
that son of yours any time soon.

863
01:27:33,668 --> 01:27:38,105
Blood in the urine.
Early indicator of kidney failure.

864
01:27:41,776 --> 01:27:44,904
You should be seeing double
right about now.

865
01:27:45,947 --> 01:27:48,973
That would be a torn meniscus.

866
01:28:32,327 --> 01:28:34,955
- James.
- Gun.

867
01:28:40,702 --> 01:28:42,329
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

868
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:46,304
Mom.

869
01:28:46,708 --> 01:28:48,733
- Please, help us.
- Shut the fuck up.

870
01:28:48,943 --> 01:28:50,638
Come on, Castle.

871
01:28:50,845 --> 01:28:52,574
Don't be shy.

872
01:28:57,118 --> 01:28:59,086
Throw down your gun.

873
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,851
- Die, you bastard.
- No.

874
01:29:08,063 --> 01:29:11,191
James, that's no way
to punish The Punisher.

875
01:29:31,419 --> 01:29:32,784
Nice shooter.

876
01:29:45,233 --> 01:29:46,393
Catch.

877
01:29:46,768 --> 01:29:48,395
Let's play a game, what do you say?

878
01:29:49,537 --> 01:29:51,368
You got one round left in there.

879
01:29:52,841 --> 01:29:54,809
You shoot one of these two.

880
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:57,105
I'll let the other one go free.

881
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,111
What do you say, Frank?

882
01:30:00,315 --> 01:30:02,909
Who's it to be,
your fat friend right here?

883
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:05,484
Or that nice little piece
of jailbait over there?

884
01:30:05,687 --> 01:30:07,154
Burn in hell.

885
01:30:07,355 --> 01:30:09,323
Okay, then they both die.

886
01:30:09,524 --> 01:30:10,991
Frank.

887
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:13,327
She's a kid.

888
01:30:14,562 --> 01:30:16,223
Shoot me.

889
01:30:32,213 --> 01:30:33,612
Okay, fuck it. Kill her first.

890
01:30:33,815 --> 01:30:34,975
- No.
- Stop.

891
01:30:38,319 --> 01:30:40,514
He's made a decision.

892
01:30:42,056 --> 01:30:45,184
Not looking too good for you, fatso.

893
01:30:49,097 --> 01:30:51,327
After three, Castle.

894
01:30:51,766 --> 01:30:53,393
One.

895
01:30:54,335 --> 01:30:55,700
Two.

896
01:30:55,904 --> 01:30:57,701
You won't feel a thing, Micro.

897
01:30:59,574 --> 01:31:00,632
Three.

898
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:30,562
God...

899
01:31:44,886 --> 01:31:46,148
Frank.

900
01:31:56,231 --> 01:31:57,789
Get out.

901
01:32:22,123 --> 01:32:23,920
Fuck you.

902
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:26,457
Let me put you out of my misery.

903
01:32:32,267 --> 01:32:34,531
This is just the beginning.

904
01:32:58,626 --> 01:32:59,820
You okay?

905
01:33:01,429 --> 01:33:03,397
- Where's Castle?
- Still inside.

906
01:33:03,598 --> 01:33:05,259
And Micro?

907
01:33:10,171 --> 01:33:11,160
Frank.

908
01:33:11,372 --> 01:33:13,397
Frank, are you okay?

909
01:33:21,316 --> 01:33:22,943
You better get out of here.

910
01:33:23,151 --> 01:33:26,018
Yeah. Come on, Frank,
I'll buy you a drink.

911
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:27,244
Wait.

912
01:33:27,455 --> 01:33:28,752
Wait.

913
01:33:29,857 --> 01:33:31,256
My husband...

914
01:33:31,459 --> 01:33:32,892
...Nicky.

915
01:33:33,695 --> 01:33:34,753
We talked about you.

916
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:38,355
Argued about you.

917
01:33:41,202 --> 01:33:43,500
He said you were one of the good guys.

918
01:34:28,683 --> 01:34:30,207
You know, buddy.

919
01:34:30,418 --> 01:34:32,682
Maybe it's time to quit now, huh?

920
01:34:32,887 --> 01:34:36,584
I mean, you must get tired of this, right?

921
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:39,123
And I think you got
all the criminals in town.

922
01:34:39,327 --> 01:34:40,851
If there are any left...

923
01:34:41,062 --> 01:34:44,156
...they ought to
at least consider rehabilitation.

924
01:34:44,499 --> 01:34:47,866
I mean, contrary to popular belief,
people can change.

925
01:34:48,069 --> 01:34:49,536
I guess what I'm saying is...

926
01:34:49,737 --> 01:34:53,138
...I'm just personally
not a fan of the death penalty.

927
01:34:54,809 --> 01:34:56,276
Frank?

928
01:34:57,145 --> 01:34:58,612
Where did he go?

929
01:34:59,047 --> 01:35:00,537
Hey.

930
01:35:01,449 --> 01:35:04,111
Give me your fucking wallet,
motherfucker.

931
01:35:04,318 --> 01:35:05,376
You're kidding, right?

932
01:35:05,586 --> 01:35:07,247
Do I look like I'm fucking kidding?

933
01:35:07,455 --> 01:35:08,581
Frank.

934
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:10,519
Give me your wallet.

935
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:13,886
- Frank.
- Do you wanna die?

936
01:35:15,463 --> 01:35:17,522
For the last time, give me your wallet.

937
01:35:24,172 --> 01:35:28,165
Oh, God.
Now I've got brain splattered all over me.

938
