1
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,804
The war
between sorcerers

2
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,390
was fought in the shadows of history

3
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:02,854
and the fate of mankind rested with
the just and powerful Merlin.

4
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,025
He taught his secrets
to three trusted apprentices,

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,488
Balthazar, Veronica, and Horvath.

6
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,324
He should have trusted only two.

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,543
Veronica and Balthazar
witnessed the savagery

8
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,628
of a sorcerer beyond evil,

9
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:37,096
Morgana le Fay,
Merlin's most deadly enemy.

10
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,282
We are but servants.

11
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,911
- Merlin.
- Horvath!

12
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,955
You betray me?

13
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,710
I am no one's servant.

14
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,548
Well done. Now get the spell.

15
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:17,553
And so it was. Morgana
gained sorcery's most dangerous spell

16
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,097
known as "The Rising,"

17
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,309
giving Morgana the power
to raise an army of the dead

18
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,685
and enslave mankind.

19
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,454
Veronica sacrificed herself
for Balthazar

20
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,791
by drawing Morgana's soul
into her own body.

21
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,294
But Morgana began to kill her
from the inside.

22
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:56,050
To save Veronica's life
and to capture Morgana,

23
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,512
Balthazar trapped them both
in the Grimhold,

24
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,681
an inescapable prison.

25
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,853
Over time,
Balthazar fought many sorcerers

26
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,521
who tried to free Morgana,

27
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,649
trapping them in layer upon layer
of the doll.

28
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,903
Eventually, he captured
Horvath as well.

29
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,742
As Merlin lay dying,
he gave Balthazar his dragon ring,

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,287
saying it would guide him to the child

31
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,415
who would one day grow
to be Merlin's successor,

32
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,292
the Prime Merlinean.

33
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,919
The Prime Merlinean is the only one

34
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,214
who can kill Morgana.

35
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,509
Balthazar would search for centuries.

36
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,112
And never, it is said,
will Balthazar waver from his quest,

37
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,073
for mankind will never be safe

38
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:06,370
until Morgana is destroyed
by the Prime Merlinean.

39
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,799
Hey, Tank.
How did you even get up here?

40
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,510
David? Field trip today.

41
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,804
Don't forget to wear clean underwear.

42
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,890
She means me, not you.

43
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,794
You're not supposed to be
doing that, Dave.

44
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:56,921
Now!

45
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,716
David.

46
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,636
That's cool.

47
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:22,029
...which means that before Ellis Island
and the Statue of Liberty were built...

48
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,115
Pass it to Becky.

49
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,117
- Pass it on.
- Pass it on.

50
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,202
- Pass it to Becky.
- Here.

51
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,888
Let's go.

52
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,058
Get on the ferry. Get your bags.
Stay close. Here we go.

53
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,112
Hey, stop!

54
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,797
Excuse me, excuse me.

55
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,549
No!

56
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,426
No, lady, don't!

57
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,494
No way.

58
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,009
The second emperor
of the Han dynasty

59
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:54,390
locked his least-favorite wife
in this urn for 10 years to the day.

60
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,894
They say you open it up,
the same thing will happen to you.

61
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,273
I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note.

62
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,234
Have you seen it?
It kind of just blew into your store.

63
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,153
A note?

64
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,779
It blew into your store.

65
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,781
It was just a...

66
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,575
Coincidence.

67
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,243
Yeah, it was just a coincidence.

68
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,543
I have something
I'd like to show you, Dave.

69
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,421
- How'd you know my name was Dave?
- 'Cause I can read minds!

70
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,592
It's on your backpack.

71
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,138
Come over here.

72
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,571
This is very special

73
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,616
and if it likes you, you can keep it.

74
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,204
I better not. My teacher said
I couldn't be gone for long.

75
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,455
She knows I'm here.

76
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,040
You're a bad liar, Dave.

77
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,043
That's good.

78
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,300
Oh, boy.

79
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,828
No way.

80
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:45,292
I have been searching a very long time.

81
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,880
Magically, here you are.

82
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,175
That ring on your finger
means something, Dave.

83
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,594
It means

84
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,515
you're going to be
a very important sorcerer one day.

85
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:05,187
And your first lesson begins right now
with your very own Encantus.

86
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,400
Do not move, do not touch anything.

87
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,128
No way.

88
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,732
When am I?

89
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,734
New York City.

90
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,529
Not where. The year.

91
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,325
You are wasting my time.

92
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,626
What happened
to "don't touch anything"?

93
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,795
That's not very sporting of you,
Balthazar.

94
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,879
Be quiet.

95
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,092
It's not you. He's been like this
for 1,000 years. I'll explain later.

96
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,969
I need the Grimhold. Where's that doll?

97
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,013
I'll have that doll.

98
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,438
I want that doll.

99
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,780
Leave, Dave! Leave now!

100
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,418
David Stutler! Don't ever leave your...

101
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,295
There's these crazy wizard guys
in there!

102
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,546
They're made of roaches!

103
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,383
No! Don't go in there!
The store's on fire! Don't go in!

104
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,219
Those guys are

105
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,473
crazy.

106
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,146
You really shouldn't
tell stories. Let's go.

107
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,859
Ew! He peed his pants!

108
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,616
A jar broke. It's just water!
There was a fire!

109
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,120
Yeah, Stutler had a leak.

110
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,164
He's such a geek.

111
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,655
Good morning. What is that? Oh, right.

112
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,659
Good morning, beautiful.

113
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,747
Hey, heads up.

114
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,915
Oh.

115
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,166
Happy birthday.

116
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,294
Thank you, Bennet.

117
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,671
You're up early.

118
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:28,677
Professor Heiderman wants me to give
a presentation to his Physics 101 class.

119
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,971
What? Teaching long division
to English majors?

120
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,932
I know. It's like the Peace Corps,
but it's Heiderman's class.

121
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,352
Hey, Bio nerds
are getting drunk tonight.

122
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,399
And we invited cheerleaders
from Princeton.

123
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,068
Oh. So there's smart cheerleaders.

124
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:50,532
So, seriously, you're saying you don't
want to go out on your birthday?

125
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,912
I got to finish my Tesla coil project
if I want to graduate.

126
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,918
Dave, are you familiar
with the gray wolf?

127
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,130
Oh, no, please, Bennet. Not this again
with the gray wolf. I can't...

128
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,633
The gray wolf is a pack animal.

129
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:12,471
He must find a mate.
He must hunt and grunt.

130
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,264
He must participate.

131
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,642
You're going to get
booted out of the pack!

132
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,062
Alone. Eaten by a hungry bear.

133
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,859
That's a real pick-me-up pep talk,
and I'm ready to go get the day.

134
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,410
No, no.

135
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,371
Oh, man.

136
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,251
Everything okay down there?

137
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,801
I should just leave, right?

138
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,344
Right.

139
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,856
Wait. I'm sorry. Becky?

140
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,775
Becky Barnes.

141
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,406
Dave!

142
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,992
We were in fourth grade together.

143
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,745
I do know you. Dave Stutler.

144
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,497
- Right?
- That's me.

145
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,083
Yeah. You're that kid.

146
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,668
What was that place called?

147
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,878
- Arcana...
- Arcana Cabana?

148
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,338
Yeah.

149
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,300
- So, did you transfer?
- Yeah, I did.

150
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:36,138
And got some help. Treatment.

151
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,057
Yes, that was weird.

152
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,061
You know what? It turns out
it's just a glucose imbalance.

153
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,646
Hallucinations?

154
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,649
- Not uncommon in young subjects.
- Ah...

155
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,317
Right.

156
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,903
It's a great anecdote.

157
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,257
Hey, Becky.

158
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,635
Becky? Hey, Becky?

159
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,431
So how are you enjoying Physics 101?

160
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,684
My brain
just does not think physics.

161
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,770
So, what does it think, then?

162
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,605
Music, mostly.

163
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,316
So, this is me.

164
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,234
You work at the radio station?

165
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,279
Yeah, I do an afternoon show.

166
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,156
Are you kidding me? That's so cool!

167
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,243
It's just college radio.
Like, seven people listen to it.

168
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,371
I'll be listening. That's one more.
You can round it up to eight.

169
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,544
I think that's our antenna!

170
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,546
- What's going on?
- Hey, gorgeous.

171
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,258
The whole mixer is toast,
and Freddy called in sick.

172
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,095
Sorry to bother you.

173
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,765
Where does your engineer
keep his equipment?

174
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,683
Who's this guy?

175
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,646
So, the good news is
you're still transmitting.

176
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,233
The bad news is
your return loss, way too high.

177
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,739
All right, if I know what I'm doing,

178
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,285
we should be good!

179
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,164
Yes!

180
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,210
- Thank you.
- No, please, it was my pleasure.

181
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,630
I could tell
this is all pretty important for you.

182
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:39,010
My show is the one thing that...
Well, you know.

183
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,262
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,349
Physics. That's my thing.

185
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,946
I'll see you around.

186
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,865
You didn't ask her out!

187
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,783
You just fixed her antenna and you left.

188
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:06,204
That's not the point.
She will remember me.

189
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,624
"She will remember me"?
Who are you? Braveheart?

190
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,044
Bennet, I blew my shot
at getting this girl 10 years ago.

191
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,713
I can't do it again.

192
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,716
Now get out of here
before you get electrocuted.

193
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,469
...and it's
a miracle we made it on the air tonight.

194
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,389
This show may not matter,
but the music does.

195
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:28,935
This is Becky Barnes, WNYU Radio,
hoping there's music all around you.

196
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,349
I don't understand. Why did you have
to buy this piece of junk?

197
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,851
Junk? It's an antique!

198
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,146
Antique? It's a piece of junk
from a flea market!

199
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,873
Am I the first one out?

200
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,961
That's a yes.

201
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,713
Our 10 years are up, Balthazar.

202
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,092
When I get the Grimhold
from young David,

203
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,010
I'll tell him you said hello.

204
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,223
Cheerio, Balthazar!

205
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,197
I thought B- was generous.

206
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,367
I've recently been released
from a 10-year sentence,

207
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:52,287
during which the only reading material
available to me

208
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:56,166
was your so-called report
on Napoleon Bonaparte

209
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,876
from your school bag.

210
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,170
Your analysis was obvious,
your prose was weak.

211
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,630
- I was nine.
- Irrelevant.

212
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,760
Where's the Grimhold?
That doll you took from the shop.

213
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,721
The doll held something very powerful.

214
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,307
Something very important to me.

215
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,434
You had it last.

216
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,894
I want it back.

217
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,437
Listen, I'm...

218
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,732
- I threw it in the street.
- Where's the Grimhold?

219
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,984
It's been a long time.
I don't actually know where it is.

220
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,573
I'll cut the truth out of you.

221
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,665
Sweet.

222
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,253
Get him.

223
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,007
Wolves? No, no, no, no.

224
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,475
Oh!

225
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,900
Thank you.

226
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,363
Wolves.

227
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,962
Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

228
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,926
No, no, no.

229
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,303
Oh, no!

230
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,642
Kill him.

231
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,853
No!

232
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,899
Puppies?

233
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,448
Oh, my.

234
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,202
No way.

235
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,705
Where's the doll, Dave?

236
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,082
Him, him.

237
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,505
All right, get up here.
Now! Now! Hurry!

238
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,559
Oh, no!

239
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,375
This is not happening.
This is not happening.

240
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,002
I taste sour in my mouth.

241
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,379
Take it easy, Dave. Deep breaths.

242
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,344
What?

243
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,181
Now that is not happening!

244
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,266
What's wrong?
What is it?

245
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,685
No, no, no, no!

246
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,812
You are not doing this to me again!

247
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:09,400
Do you have any idea what my life
has been like for the last 10 years?

248
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,527
I've been stuck in an urn
for the last 10 years.

249
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:16,824
So have I! A figurative urn of ridicule.

250
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,787
Do you know that in certain parts
of the tri-state area,

251
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,665
they still refer
to having a nervous breakdown

252
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,001
as "pulling a David Stutler"?
Did you know that?

253
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,503
Try to be a good listener, Dave.

254
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,006
That doll is called the Grimhold.

255
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,843
It is a prison for the most dangerous
Morganians in history,

256
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,347
each one locked up
in a layer of the doll.

257
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:45,019
Horvath wants to free his fellow
Morganians and destroy the world.

258
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:50,608
This must not happen.

259
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,528
Yeah. For sure.

260
00:26:56,573 --> 00:27:00,785
The truth is,
you have a very special gift.

261
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,538
You need to see that.

262
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,332
I just want to be normal.

263
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:11,004
Normal life. I want to forget about
that day at Arcana Cabana.

264
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:16,050
I want to forget about magic.
I want to forget everything.

265
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,096
- You should duck.
- What?

266
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,268
You want to forget magic?

267
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,105
Then why did you keep the ring?

268
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:35,194
I was going to sell that on eBay.

269
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:39,073
You're still a bad liar, Dave.
I like that about you. It's a good sign.

270
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,117
You have the gift.

271
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,411
No, I have a life.

272
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,955
You're the last person Horvath saw
with the Grimhold.

273
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,582
That puts you on his list.

274
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,044
So unless you want him to turn you
into a pig who just loves physics,

275
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,921
then you better help me
find that doll before he does.

276
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:58,092
This is crazy.
You see how crazy this is, right?

277
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,054
All right. All right.

278
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,099
You help me get it back, you're done.

279
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,269
- Really?
- You can walk away.

280
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,275
Can you please put my dresser back?

281
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,865
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

282
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,201
What are you... Oh, no.

283
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,870
Please don't do that.
What are you doing?

284
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,332
What?

285
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,335
- Whoa. What is that?
- It's my Grimhold tracking device.

286
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:36,589
Biometric pressure spell displaces
the atmosphere above the doll.

287
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,174
Looks like downtown.

288
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,760
If we can track the Grimhold,
so can Horvath.

289
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:45,181
- So why don't we just take the eagle?
- Too high-profile for a trip downtown.

290
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,394
- I'll have to call you a tow.
- Won't be necessary.

291
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,646
Yeah, but this car's been impounded
for 10 years.

292
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,401
This is low-profile.

293
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,488
She missed me.

294
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,830
I'm going to give you the basics.
Strictly Sorcery 101. Put on the ring.

295
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,999
Nothing's going to happen.

296
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,167
Yeah?

297
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,426
Kidding. You've heard how people use
only 10% of their brains?

298
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,595
Sorcerers can manipulate matter
because they're born with the capability

299
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,722
to use the entire power of their brains.

300
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,351
Which also explains why molecular
physics comes so easily to you.

301
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,271
So, wait. Is sorcery science or magic?

302
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,772
Yes and yes.

303
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,191
For now, all you need
is a basic combat spell.

304
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,359
Making fire.

305
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,778
What causes molecules to heat up?

306
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:41,904
They vibrate.

307
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,323
Everything we see
is in a constant state of vibration,

308
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,242
thus the illusion of solidity.

309
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,077
But how do we take
that which appears solid

310
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,912
and have it burst into flames?

311
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:54,375
We will the vibrations to go faster.
Step one, clear your mind.

312
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,003
Step two, see the molecules.

313
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,380
Step three, make them shake.

314
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,468
- Got it?
- No! I definitely don't "got it."

315
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,053
Trust the ring, Dave.
And keep it subtle.

316
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,641
Civilians mustn't know magic exists.
That would be complicated.

317
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,604
Says the guy in the 350-year-old
rawhide trench coat.

318
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,404
I threw it in the street.

319
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,658
It's been a long time.
I don't actually know where it is.

320
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,744
I threw it in the street.

321
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,787
Don't go in there!

322
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,873
Ew! He peed his pants!

323
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,042
The store's on fire! Don't go in!
Those guys are...

324
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,295
It's just water! There was a fire!

325
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,965
I threw it in the street.

326
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,425
But where?

327
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,772
Get out of the way, freak!
I need to pull in there!

328
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,273
Are you addressing me?

329
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,858
Hey, don't mess with me.

330
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,280
Where was I?

331
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,075
Chinatown.

332
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,639
This is it. I'll get the Grimhold.
Keep an eye out for Horvath.

333
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,691
Hi.

334
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:10,928
Can I help you?
Do you have an appointment?

335
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,347
I'm sorry to trouble you.
I'm looking for a...

336
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:17,476
Well, it's rather strange.
It's a nesting doll. It's about this big.

337
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,854
Angry-looking Chinese gentleman
on the front.

338
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,939
- Nesting doll?
- Yes.

339
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,859
It's possible. I collect so many objects.

340
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,864
Ah!

341
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,283
You speak Mandarin.

342
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,659
Ah.

343
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,248
That was Cantonese, Horvath.

344
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,835
The Grimhold. Where is it?

345
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,339
An old associate of mine
speaks impeccable Cantonese.

346
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,507
He lived about 200 years ago.

347
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,551
Know him? Sun Lok.

348
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,514
Of course you do.
You locked him inside the Grimhold.

349
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,601
Whoops.

350
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,353
Opened it.

351
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,694
Whoa!

352
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:09,862
Are you all right?

353
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,697
Looks like...

354
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,366
What the...

355
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,493
Yay!

356
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,078
I'm like one of them.

357
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,245
Dave?

358
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,331
You should run.

359
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,482
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

360
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:21,767
Be still.

361
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,288
Balthazar!

362
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,838
Oh, God. Come on.

363
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,967
You skipped the first step!

364
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,052
- Clear your mind!
- Skipped the first step.

365
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,060
Clear my mind? Are you insane?

366
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,063
Little bit.

367
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:21,744
Oh, man.

368
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,921
This is it.

369
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,715
Clear your mind. Believe.

370
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,492
Yeah!

371
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,745
Go Team Magical Stuff!

372
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,757
Did you see that?
Did you see what I just did?

373
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:17,842
I did it.

374
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,181
It can't be.

375
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,647
Unbelievable.

376
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,528
Hey, what do you got?
Did you see what happened here?

377
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:42,533
You know what? Bottle rocket meets
paper dragon in this Asian festival.

378
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,368
Lit it up like a birthday cake.

379
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,579
We got swamped with calls
saying there was a real dragon.

380
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,999
Between you and me, Cap,
I think some of these folks

381
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,459
were hitting the sake pretty hard.

382
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,795
Sake's Japanese, actually.

383
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,467
Carry on.

384
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,347
- "Sake's Japanese"?
- Well, it is.

385
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,850
- I was in character.
- Oh, right.

386
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,232
You may now return the ring to me.

387
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,654
I'm a man of my word.
You helped me, we're done.

388
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,489
Right. Right.

389
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,663
I'd like to learn some more.

390
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,792
We'll need a place to work.

391
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,004
Somewhere under Horvath's radar.

392
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,797
I think I can help with that.

393
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:51,101
This was originally
a subway turnaround.

394
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,770
They let me work down here

395
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,231
because some of my experiments
skew a bit dangerous.

396
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,403
Oh, my professor has a hookup,
so nobody knows we're down here.

397
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,032
Oh.

398
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,743
I didn't have a chance
to give you this before.

399
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,037
Your Encantus.

400
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,124
I remember it being bigger.

401
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,793
Pocket edition.

402
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,462
The Encantus is our textbook.

403
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:24,093
The art and science and history
of sorcery.

404
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,054
Including our recent history as well.

405
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,392
Come on.

406
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,979
See? There you are.

407
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,731
Oh.

408
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,402
Before we can put Horvath
back inside the Grimhold,

409
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,154
we must first turn you into a sorcerer,

410
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,532
which begins now.

411
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,242
Step back.

412
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,079
- I really was doing stuff.
- Eyes open.

413
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,622
Mouth closed.

414
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,366
This is the Merlin Circle.

415
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,702
It focuses your energy.

416
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,788
Helps you master new spells.

417
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,000
It is where you will learn the Art.

418
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,463
Step inside,
you leave everything else behind.

419
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,466
Once you enter,

420
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,261
there is no going back.

421
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,600
So, I should probably pee first?

422
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,810
Better safe than...

423
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,648
I can hold it.

424
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,114
I am Balthazar Blake,

425
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,618
sorcerer of the 777th degree,

426
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,413
and you are my apprentice.

427
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,750
Sweet.

428
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,253
Your ring is not a piece of jewelry.

429
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:27,049
It projects the electrical energy
of your nervous system

430
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,801
into the physical world.

431
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,137
Without his ring,
a sorcerer is powerless.

432
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,140
The only other thing a sorcerer needs

433
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,352
is a nice pair of pointy shoes.

434
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,605
Your rubber soles block the current.

435
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,565
Plus it helps to look classy.

436
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,734
These are old man shoes.

437
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,030
Excuse me?

438
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,199
I love them.

439
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,119
A lot.

440
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,932
I haven't seen that cane since I saw
a picture of it when I was a boy.

441
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,810
You've been locked up a long time.

442
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,145
And now I'm out.

443
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,397
And I need soldiers.

444
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,690
I got one kid.

445
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,985
He ain't old school.

446
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,820
One will do.

447
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,157
Your ingenuity and your heart

448
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,285
will give you an advantage
over Morganians.

449
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,246
They rely only
on the power of their magic.

450
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:44,418
But if you're up against the wall,
there's only one weapon of choice,

451
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,211
the plasma bolt.

452
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,471
Nothing. There's nothing.

453
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,434
I got it! I got one! I got one!

454
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,104
That's underwhelming.

455
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:06,857
God.

456
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,443
Again.

457
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,028
Ow! Ow! Ow!

458
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,536
...and invite my soul...

459
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:20,746
And again.

460
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,000
See? That's what padding is for. Oh!

461
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,053
So, out of a bath full of jewels,
I'm going to emerge, right?

462
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,721
And everyone's going to think I'm me.

463
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,433
I reach into the big top hat
and I pull myself out,

464
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,310
but I'm a woman.

465
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,023
A ball of fire, right, a baby sitting
in a nappy, but I would like a tiger.

466
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,276
If I could get, like,
a tiger jumping out of a leopard.

467
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,238
But not out of its mouth,
that's been done, I'm sure, somewhere.

468
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:59,117
Gorgeous. Just perfect, darling.

469
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:02,287
Yeah. Yeah, now,
keep it straight up sinister.

470
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,332
Oh, do tell me this is a joke.

471
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,710
Sorry, are you lost?

472
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,839
So, you're what passes
for a Morganian these days.

473
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,803
Maxim Horvath!
You are one smoking man of...

474
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,471
Will you excuse us, ladies?

475
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,556
Yes, excuse us, ladies.

476
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,978
Bob.

477
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,063
Sorry.

478
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:33,026
So, they tell me
you're some kind of entertainer.

479
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,281
Five sold-out shows at the Garden,
plus back end on the pay-per-view.

480
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,244
Did you ever see Morgana
pull a rabbit out of a hat?

481
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,831
Look, my master disappeared
when I was 15, vanished!

482
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,582
Left me with nothing but an Encantus

483
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,294
and some prescription-grade
abandonment issues.

484
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,170
So I improvised.

485
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,756
Well, the time for improvisation is over.

486
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:00,220
Balthazar Blake may have found
the Prime Merlinean.

487
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,596
He wears the ring?

488
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,889
Mmm.

489
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,437
The best way to defend against fire,

490
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,024
vacuum sphere.

491
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:14,985
Your turn.

492
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,575
I did it! I did it!

493
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,036
Excellent. Excellent.

494
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,496
- Excellent.
- I just did that.

495
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,711
What's wrong with your Tesla coil?
It seems to be firing on its own.

496
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,925
Really, really funny.

497
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,719
This will be hilarious, then.

498
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,179
Oh, my God!

499
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,477
Dude!

500
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,272
Beg your pardon.
I haven't eaten in 10 years.

501
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,608
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

502
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,152
You mind if I ask
what's so special about this bench?

503
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,658
- No, no, no.
- What?

504
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,577
There's no time for that,
and too much at stake.

505
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,412
That girl,

506
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,248
she's the one, man.

507
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,210
And you're my mentor, Balthazar.

508
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:17,172
Aren't you supposed to help me
to achieve my personal goals?

509
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:20,550
Yes! Yes! Except I'm not your mentor.

510
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,344
I'm your master.

511
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,472
And your master says
if Horvath catches you out on the street,

512
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,932
you'll die.

513
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,059
Is she worth that?

514
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,269
Think about it, Dave.

515
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,319
And don't eat my sandwich.

516
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,989
Becky! What a coincidence.

517
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,783
Oh, hey, Dave.

518
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,536
- Going uptown or...
- Are you stalking me?

519
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,121
Not in a threatening way.

520
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,415
Why was I even concerned?

521
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,501
So I listened to your show last night.

522
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,711
- What did you think?
- It was amazing.

523
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,547
I've never actually heard
of any of those bands,

524
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,966
which I think is a good indicator
that they're cool.

525
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,761
I'm glad someone was listening.

526
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,889
This may come as a surprise to you,
I don't get up to much.

527
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,892
Give me the cash. Give it. Come on.

528
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,144
- Give me the bracelet.
- Okay, okay.

529
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,728
Hey, hey, hey.

530
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,692
That was my grandmother's bracelet.

531
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,447
No! Dave, don't!

532
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,169
You just give me
that bracelet back, please.

533
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,171
You better run back to your girlfriend.

534
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:42,424
Believe me, I wish she was...

535
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,217
You thought she was my girlfriend?

536
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:47,512
Really? Is that the kind of vibe you got?

537
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,723
You talk too much. Shut up.

538
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,436
What are you doing?

539
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,272
I have no idea what you're referring to.
I honestly...

540
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,067
Whoa!

541
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,903
- You seeing this?
- Heads up.

542
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,242
Up the stairs!

543
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,412
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Here you go.

544
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,456
Your grandmother's bracelet.

545
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,667
How did you do that?
That guy was huge.

546
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,713
I've been doing a lot
of cardio boxing lately.

547
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,425
Let me introduce Thunder, Lightning.

548
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,264
Something about you seems different.

549
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,226
I'm wearing new shoes.

550
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,980
- Nice.
- Thank you. This your train?

551
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,275
Yes. Thank you.

552
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,694
I just want to tell you that

553
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,030
if you want me to help you
with your midterms,

554
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,323
come by my lab.

555
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,076
- I'll text you the address.
- Yes, yes, that would be great.

556
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,953
- Yeah?
- Tomorrow?

557
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,204
It's a date.

558
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,793
No, no, no. It's not a date!
It's a date like an appointment.

559
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,046
No. A date like an appointment!

560
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,391
Love is a distraction.

561
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,811
Sorcery requires complete focus.

562
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,898
Let's go, Thunder and Lightning.
There's more to learn.

563
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,321
This is perfect.

564
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,032
The Rising will happen here.

565
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,911
We'll use their satellite dishes
on the rooftops.

566
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:40,000
There, and there, and there.

567
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:45,130
- Get it done.
- My "Best of" DVD drops next month.

568
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,925
Here we go. All right. Move.

569
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,015
Sorry about that. It's just nice for them
to see a genuine icon like me.

570
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,435
Fortunately, they'll all be dead soon.

571
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,022
And before that,
we need to find the boy.

572
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,481
Well, how do we do that?

573
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,194
We'll wait until he's alone.

574
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:15,577
Now, focus on control.
Set me down slow and steady.

575
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,875
Dave? It's Becky.

576
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,045
I'll be back shortly.

577
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,797
Could you please hide?
Hide now. Please.

578
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,633
Dave, get back here.

579
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,092
We have important work to do.

580
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,469
- Knock, knock.
- Yeah.

581
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,764
- Hi.
- Hi.

582
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,141
We should go. A library, anyplace...

583
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,351
Dave?

584
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,729
Is that company I hear?

585
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:47,901
Yeah. Okay. Fine. Becky, this is my...

586
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,278
Uncle. Uncle Balthazar.

587
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,155
Hey, Dave, I'm confused.

588
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,532
I thought you and I
were staying in together.

589
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,201
If this is a bad time,

590
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,911
- I can come back.
- Yes, actually.

591
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,079
No. No.

592
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,582
Uncle, you and I have plans for later on.

593
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,751
Becky, let's just get out of here.

594
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,212
You know what? It's all right,
because I just remembered

595
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,340
I have to go into town
to pick up your anti-itch cream.

596
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,385
So, you two stay here.
Pleasure to meet you.

597
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,397
Okay, enough with the studying.
There's something I want to show you.

598
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,983
- What are these things?
- Tesla coils.

599
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:14,070
I was using them
to generate something called plasma.

600
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:19,743
The thing is, I got so fixated
on the technical aspects of it

601
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:24,372
that I almost didn't notice
something kind of

602
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,166
beautiful.

603
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,795
I think you'd better step into my cage.

604
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,091
Okay, it's definitely the first time
anyone has said that to me.

605
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,218
I'm not surprised.

606
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,805
Just hold on to this bar, please.

607
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,224
Both hands. Yep.

608
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:44,976
Okay.

609
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:55,028
Okay, hold on tight and enjoy the show.

610
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,994
Oh, my gosh.

611
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,164
How is this possible?

612
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,542
The coils are firing
at such a high frequency

613
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:13,630
that the sparks literally create
soundwaves as they fly through the air.

614
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,632
Which is nerdy.

615
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:32,941
You were listening.

616
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,193
I played this song the other night.

617
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,904
These coils are my life.

618
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,366
Two years I'm down here
working with them,

619
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,702
and they're making their own music
and it was lost on me.

620
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,497
I was never able to appreciate it

621
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:49,999
until I met you

622
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,504
and heard you talking about music
on your radio show, and...

623
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,799
I'm sappy.

624
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:25,493
This is me.

625
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:29,706
So, do you want to meet up later?
8:00? My lab?

626
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,375
Yeah. Yeah, that would be great.

627
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,626
With me?

628
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,628
With you? Yes.

629
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,880
Making sure.

630
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:40,717
- I got to... Yoga.
- Yeah, I've got to go to the bathroom.

631
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:46,639
I got a date with a girl
'cause I'm awesome

632
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:49,767
So, you're the one.

633
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,644
Excuse me?

634
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,690
Prime Merlinean, eh?
You don't look like much.

635
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,819
I don't actually know
what you're talking about.

636
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,779
Cool. Makes this easy.

637
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,870
Can't have anyone
hearing your girly cries, right?

638
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,290
I don't actually know who you are.

639
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,709
Really, you don't recognize me?

640
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,086
Are you in Depeche Mode?

641
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,714
What... What...

642
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,762
- What do you weigh, like a buck 20?
- Whoa! What the...

643
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,348
This is high school all over again.

644
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,101
All right, I tell you what.

645
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:35,146
Hit me with your best shot,
your most powerful spell.

646
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,441
- Okay.
- Get the ring out. Put it on. Good boy.

647
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,111
Okay.

648
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,238
Ow!

649
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,074
- No, I'm joking.
- Nothing is happening.

650
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,992
- Have you cleared your mind?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

651
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,036
- That's nerves and it's the pressure.
- I got nothing happening.

652
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,121
- I'm new at this.
- The ring's on. Take the ring off.

653
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,289
- Take off the ring.
- Take it off.

654
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:57,001
- Yeah, it doesn't help me...
- Enough, you idiot. Watch the door.

655
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,049
You.

656
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:07,428
No!

657
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,557
- Hello, Dave.
- Hi.

658
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,019
- So, Dave.
- Oh, man.

659
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:22,068
I'm going to kill you. Oh, yes,
right here in this dismal bathroom.

660
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,862
It's not very classy, but there you go.

661
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,240
But before we get
to that unpleasantness,

662
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,283
you're going to tell me
where the Grimhold is.

663
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:31,995
Where is she?

664
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,622
She?

665
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,876
He hasn't told you, has he?

666
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:42,338
The truth about who's inside the doll?

667
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,553
Sweetheart, you've put your faith
in the wrong man.

668
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:54,142
Tell me, have you ever been in love?

669
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:56,853
- I...
- Yeah.

670
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,272
You're in love right now.
I can see it in your eyes.

671
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,607
No, no, no, no. Don't deny it.

672
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,402
I wonder what would happen

673
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,613
if you lost her.

674
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,700
Shut up.

675
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,664
You'd be no better than the rest of us.

676
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,590
Where is the Grimhold?

677
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:29,594
I don't know.

678
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,930
Oh, Dave, you really are
the most dreadful liar.

679
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,183
That's what I keep telling him.

680
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,684
Want your guy back?

681
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:39,979
Oh!

682
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:47,779
It's been a while since I've seen
the Hungarian Mirror Trap.

683
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,201
I guess I'm just old-fashioned.

684
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,500
Balthazar, look out!

685
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:08,966
What are you doing here, Dave?

686
00:57:09,802 --> 00:57:11,552
Horvath was trying to kill me.

687
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,013
His moral compass
doesn't exactly point north.

688
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,182
Yeah, well, what about yours? Huh?

689
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:19,352
You haven't been completely truthful
with me.

690
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,188
That guy called me
the Prime Merlinean.

691
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:24,482
Balthazar, what is that?

692
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,734
Now, I'm not doing anything else

693
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:30,863
until you start being truthful with me
about what's going on.

694
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,700
Who is in that Grimhold?

695
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,829
Morgana.

696
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,462
Wake up that moron

697
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:49,215
in stall number three for me,
would you?

698
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,847
Oh, for heaven's sake.

699
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,016
Morgana.

700
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:03,354
She was making preparations
for The Rising,

701
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,649
something that would enable her
to enslave mankind

702
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,235
by resurrecting
dead Morganian sorcerers.

703
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,446
So, after the witch girl,
there's another doll

704
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,907
that contains the greatest evil
the world has ever known?

705
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,284
She's in the last doll.

706
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:20,413
And what does it have to do with this

707
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,541
Prime Merlinean?

708
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,626
Merlin had three apprentices.

709
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,295
I was one of them.

710
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,090
You were Merlin's apprentice?

711
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,259
He cast a spell to keep us from aging

712
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:37,180
until we found the sorcerer
who would inherit his power.

713
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:40,308
And his dragon ring.

714
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:46,105
Some part of you, no matter how small,

715
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,317
must share the same blood.

716
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,111
As Merlin?

717
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,614
Great men have always been called.

718
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,657
This is your calling.

719
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,243
Merlin said,

720
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:04,165
"The only one who will ever be able
to destroy Morgana once and for all

721
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,833
"is the Prime Merlinean."

722
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,129
So I'm supposed to save the world.

723
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,967
I... I just don't think I'm up for that.

724
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,137
Do you think
I've been teaching you magic tricks

725
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,805
for some little girl's tea party?

726
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:26,354
When you stepped inside this circle,
I told you there was no going back.

727
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:27,480
You took an oath!

728
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:32,276
I have been searching
1,000 years for you.

729
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,613
Fighting Morganians,
protecting the Grimhold.

730
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,490
You're going to set me free.

731
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,243
You have to become
the Prime Merlinean.

732
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,912
And I'm not asking.

733
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:54,674
I have a student who's failing my class.
I need his file.

734
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:59,011
First I'll need to see
your faculty identification card.

735
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:05,059
You don't need
to see my faculty identification card.

736
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:12,024
I don't need
your faculty identification card.

737
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,903
"These are not the droids
you're looking for."

738
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:25,705
Here it is.
He has an unauthorized lab space.

739
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:32,837
Okay, so, how will I know when I'm it?

740
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,923
The Prime Merlinean?

741
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,802
The Prime Merlinean
will become so powerful within

742
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,972
he no longer needs his ring
to cast magic.

743
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,890
When you can do that,

744
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,101
you're ready to take on Morgana.

745
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,814
Tank! What is he doing here anyway?

746
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,985
This should be good.

747
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,822
Schematic for a fusion spell.

748
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,659
The merging of two souls
into one physical body.

749
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:08,748
I've only ever seen one sorcerer
successfully pull off human fusion.

750
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,500
And Tank is here for...

751
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:12,835
Practice.

752
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,005
Are you telling me
you're trying to possess Tank?

753
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,722
Yeah. I'm not so sure
it's the best idea, either.

754
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,432
No.

755
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:30,728
Oh, man.

756
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:37,234
Becky's coming now,
and I'm standing in a puddle of pop.

757
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,611
I need to stop and clean.

758
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,904
We're not done training.

759
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:46,035
Balthazar, I've been waiting
for 10 years to see this girl again.

760
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,788
Do you have any idea what that's like?

761
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:52,917
When I come back,
you better be focused.

762
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,714
Ow.

763
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,260
This is really sticky.

764
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,431
I'm doomed.

765
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,601
This.

766
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,148
Thank you. Thank you.

767
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,659
I command you to stop!

768
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,791
Oh, no. Man.

769
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,279
Becky.

770
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:31,033
- Hi.
- Hi. You're on time.

771
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:35,871
- You forgot?
- No, no, no. I didn't forget.

772
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:37,915
- Is everything okay?
- What, me?

773
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,667
How are you doing?

774
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,710
I'm good. I'm good.

775
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:45,005
Would you please stop that?
Will you...

776
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:51,136
It's probably best for you to leave.

777
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,222
What am I saying?

778
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,558
Okay. Okay, I will go.

779
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:58,477
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm having issues.

780
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:07,778
My coils!

781
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:22,876
Disperse!

782
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:40,394
You have abused the sacred art,
and you have abused the Merlin Circle.

783
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,271
Magic isn't a game.

784
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:43,981
No shortcuts!

785
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:46,692
Falling in that water
and getting electrocuted,

786
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,611
that's how a sorcerer loses his power!

787
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:52,656
What rule is that?
Fourteen? Twenty-seven?

788
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:53,991
I can't even remember!

789
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,451
What difference does it make

790
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,786
if it's obvious
that I can't even control a few mops?

791
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,788
The stronger the man,
the stronger the sorcerer.

792
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,124
Thank you.
Thank you for another useless motto!

793
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,459
I have another one for you.

794
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:06,295
You will not control your magic
if you will not control yourself.

795
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,964
You need to stop your worrying
and start believing in yourself.

796
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,466
Is that what you do?

797
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,218
- What I do isn't the point.
- I think it is.

798
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:17,097
I'm convinced you exist purely
to make my life a living hell.

799
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,436
You don't know anything
about a living hell.

800
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:31,153
- You're making progress.
- No, I'm not making progress.

801
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,948
No ring, right?

802
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:42,247
No magic.
I can't move the chairs. I can't do it.

803
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:46,293
It's not me, Balthazar.

804
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:48,337
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

805
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:55,469
I'm not it. I'm not a hero.
I'm not the Prime Merlinean.

806
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,680
I'm just a physics nerd

807
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:01,600
who looks really, really stupid
in these shoes.

808
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:13,922
Dave.

809
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,843
What are you doing here?

810
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:22,014
I saw you outside the coffee shop,
so I followed you.

811
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,058
You looked a little more distressed
than usual.

812
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,810
That bad, huh?

813
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,313
Did you really think that
one botched date

814
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,648
was going to make me
hate you forever?

815
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:34,860
Yeah.

816
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:40,699
I do have to ask you this one thing.

817
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:44,369
What are you doing up here?

818
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:46,580
Yeah.

819
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,042
A friend of mine brought me here once.

820
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:53,712
And the height doesn't bother you?

821
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,466
- Are you afraid of heights?
- A little bit, yeah.

822
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,176
Trust me. Here, come on.

823
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,428
Come on. You're good.

824
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:03,847
- You're good.
- I don't know.

825
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,394
Wow.

826
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,523
Yeah. Wow.

827
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:18,487
Do you remember when you drew
King Kong on the bus window?

828
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,948
And he lined up
with the Empire State Building?

829
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:23,575
You remember that?

830
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:25,577
It was cool.

831
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:31,083
You saw the world in your own way.

832
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,585
I was just trying to impress you.

833
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:39,466
Well, it worked.
Not bad for a 10-year-old kid.

834
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:43,053
Yeah, right. What happened?

835
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,641
- What? What do you mean?
- The bitter irony of the fact

836
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:51,436
that 10-year-old me
is far cooler than 20-year-old me.

837
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:55,274
I think 20-year-old Dave is...
He's all right.

838
01:09:56,067 --> 01:10:00,529
Like, "all right" all right,
or "all right!" All right?

839
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:07,119
I think he is somewhere in the middle.

840
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:10,664
That's a diplomatic answer.

841
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,083
And thank you.

842
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,595
- Hey.
- Hello.

843
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:25,846
I'm sorry.

844
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:28,682
I think you and I need to have a talk.

845
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:32,227
No apology necessary. Let us move on.

846
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,146
You're a diamond, mate.

847
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:50,662
Surprisingly well done.

848
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:52,289
Now go find the Grimhold.

849
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,421
You seem to have rather a soft spot
for that boy.

850
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,174
Has Balthazar made a new friend?

851
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,426
I don't see the Grimhold.

852
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,179
That's because you're using your eyes.

853
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,181
Clever Balthazar.

854
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:12,017
Always up to his little tricks.

855
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,499
Found it.

856
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,754
It's lighter than I remember.

857
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,299
We once fought together, Maxim.

858
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,343
A lot's happened since those days.

859
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:49,680
- This isn't about that.
- Oh, yes, it is, Balthazar.

860
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:51,932
It's always been about that.

861
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:57,396
Veronica chose you instead of me,
the great Balthazar Blake,

862
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,983
my best friend.

863
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:06,071
Well, I'm going to let you
watch me release Morgana.

864
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:09,533
Let you watch your world
crumble into nothing!

865
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,348
Drake. Let's go.

866
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:38,437
- Nice catch.
- I owed you one.

867
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:40,939
- They got the doll.
- Let's get it back.

868
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,528
Hang on.

869
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,488
Hang on, Tank.

870
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:04,963
Go left.

871
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,429
Whoa! What the...

872
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:15,182
Horvath!
He's in here somewhere.

873
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,976
Wait. He has the power
to turn his car into a taxi?

874
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:20,145
Use your ring
and lock in on the Grimhold.

875
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,190
- Remember, it moves with the ring.
- Okay, yeah. Right, right, right.

876
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:32,365
Go! Go!

877
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:36,661
Here they come!

878
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,460
Whoa!

879
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:44,628
What the heck!

880
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:47,881
Nice one!

881
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,680
- Hey! Well, look at that.
- Hang on.

882
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,606
Oh, my God.

883
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:06,191
Take the tunnel.

884
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,373
What is that, smoke?

885
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,713
Oh, come on!

886
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,644
Time for a little revenge.

887
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:52,821
- What the heck is this?
- Yes, we drove through a mirror.

888
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,823
- We're trapped in a reverse world.
- So...

889
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,492
It is, it is. Horvath's payback
for the bathroom mirror.

890
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:58,869
No, no. We won't die as long as

891
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:00,412
- we get out of here soon.
- Okay.

892
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,956
- By driving through our own reflection.
- Fantastic.

893
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,000
- There. In the window.
- This is it.

894
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,428
No, no, no, no, no. You're not...

895
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,680
- Here we go.
- We're not going to make that!

896
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,516
We're not...

897
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:43,121
Hello, Balthazar.

898
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:45,540
Oh, man. Oh, man.

899
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,209
No, no, no.
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

900
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,252
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

901
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,464
Oh, man.

902
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,133
I've got an idea. I've got an idea.

903
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,177
- Dave, don't.
- Please just let me do it.

904
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:02,766
- What?
- '73 Pinto? This is your idea?

905
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,561
No! No. My idea was to turn their car
into a beater.

906
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,612
- Finish it.
- Right!

907
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,706
I think he stopped.

908
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:41,721
Hold on, Tank.
Hold on, Tank. I got you, buddy.

909
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,348
Walked away.

910
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,242
Hey!

911
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:06,496
I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

912
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:11,710
Where's Horvath?

913
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,586
Did he get away?

914
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:16,256
Where's the Grimhold? Who was that?

915
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,176
That was her, wasn't it?

916
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,679
The third apprentice.

917
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,894
For centuries, Veronica, Horvath and I
were the only thing standing

918
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:32,564
between Morgana
and man's destruction.

919
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:37,235
Our friendship and our magic were
what Veronica and I depended on.

920
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:40,488
You fell for her, didn't you?

921
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:44,576
I fell for her.

922
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:50,498
Like you,
all Veronica wanted was to be normal.

923
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:54,502
Normal things, normal life.

924
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:57,922
I fell.

925
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:02,260
And so did Horvath.

926
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:06,848
That's why Horvath betrayed us.

927
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,184
For 1,000 years,

928
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,561
you've been carrying her
around with you.

929
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,563
In the Grimhold.

930
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,776
I was going to give this to her
that night.

931
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,744
I'm sorry.

932
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,457
Okay, Balthazar.

933
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:37,170
We are going to get Veronica out
and destroy Morgana.

934
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:40,715
What's happened to you?

935
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:42,217
Nothing.

936
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:43,968
You're still a bad liar.

937
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:48,014
- Why does everyone...
- You know, I am glad she likes you.

938
01:18:48,099 --> 01:18:51,142
No, I am not surprised. Only glad.

939
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:54,521
There's nothing like it, is there?

940
01:18:56,774 --> 01:19:00,527
Put your old man shoes back on.

941
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,612
We have some work to do.

942
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,410
Are all the satellite dishes
in position?

943
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,619
All lined up.

944
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,997
I chipped my mani, which is not cool.

945
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,999
No, I imagine it's not.

946
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:19,170
Inside there lies our next coworker.

947
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:23,550
Abigail Williams,
a little witch who put Salem on the map.

948
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,803
Once she's out,
we're at the Morgana shell.

949
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:30,557
Now that's going to take a lot of time
and energy to crack.

950
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,100
So what are we going to do?

951
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,394
Have you heard of the Parasite Spell?

952
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,899
Sorry, I forgot
your education's somewhat lacking.

953
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,402
Yeah, I prefer to go more by instinct.

954
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:44,362
You know, what feels right.

955
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:48,867
Very good. Well, the Parasite Spell
is a rather nasty piece of business.

956
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:52,745
It originated in Haiti, if memory serves.

957
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:57,375
It enables one sorcerer
to steal the energy from another.

958
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:05,508
Well, you weren't really using it,
were you?

959
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:17,896
Excuse me?

960
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,606
I'd like to make a request.

961
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:23,526
I just finished my show.
But maybe next time, okay?

962
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,662
I said I'd like to make a request.

963
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,710
All right.

964
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:46,007
When Morgana is released,
no matter what happens,

965
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:50,303
promise me you'll do whatever it takes
to destroy her.

966
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,056
I promise.

967
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:57,560
And for the record,
you wear the old guy shoes very well.

968
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,480
My feet disagree with you,
but thank you.

969
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,441
Knuckle bump.

970
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,112
Might as well.

971
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:14,160
Now that I have kidnapped the girl
for you, is it time to release Morgana?

972
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:16,329
I'll give her your regards.

973
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,999
Mr. Horvath,
have I done something wrong?

974
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:22,877
Not at all.

975
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:28,883
I need your power to free Morgana.
I just don't need you.

976
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,970
Well, that's two.

977
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:33,805
One more to go.

978
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,901
That's horrifying.

979
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:50,154
Let's just find the Grimhold
and be done with it.

980
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:06,379
Battery Park. The Rising.

981
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:16,097
Persian Quickrug.

982
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:19,058
And he thinks I'm old-fashioned.

983
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,188
Ostentatious.

984
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:37,535
Ooh... Uh-huh.

985
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:46,919
Nothing, nothing.

986
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,591
So that's Morgana.

987
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:56,846
Veronica.

988
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:10,401
Balthazar?

989
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:13,988
That was easy.
Come on, Dave. You know the drill.

990
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,823
Give me what I want, and I'll let her go.

991
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,533
Dave, what is going on?

992
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:18,951
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

993
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,036
No, she's not!

994
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:24,165
She's going to be ground up
into chunks and fed to the cat

995
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:27,335
unless you give me Merlin's ring
and the Grimhold.

996
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:30,463
Balthazar?
He's busy admiring the decor.

997
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,298
So what's it going to be?

998
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:02,870
Here.

999
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,832
Take it.

1000
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,964
- You're okay?
- Merlin's ring.

1001
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,467
It's been a while
since I've been this close to it.

1002
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,720
I wonder if it still works.

1003
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:27,270
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

1004
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:34,902
The Grimhold?

1005
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,074
I see.

1006
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,369
He took my ring.

1007
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,289
He was gonna kill Becky.

1008
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,250
I'm so sorry, Balthazar.

1009
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,670
I would have done
the same thing, Dave.

1010
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:57,925
Where are you going?

1011
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:00,845
Battery Park.
Horvath's going to release Morgana.

1012
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:04,766
Well, you can't take him on
and Morgana at the same time. That's...

1013
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,477
- You literally can't.
- I have to try.

1014
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:09,103
Well, then I'm going with you.

1015
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:11,147
Without any magic?

1016
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,191
He has your ring.

1017
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:14,442
I'm going alone.

1018
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:19,405
No, that's a normal thing for him.

1019
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,911
No one knows
how much time they have

1020
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,998
to be with the people
that are the most important.

1021
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,042
Enjoy it.

1022
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,308
That guy just flew away on an eagle!

1023
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,893
- I...
- A steel eagle.

1024
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,561
Becky, I wanted to talk to you
about this.

1025
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,022
I just haven't known where to start.

1026
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:56,067
I'm just happy you're okay.

1027
01:25:56,902 --> 01:26:01,572
Look, Dave.
If you can just tell me the truth,

1028
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:05,493
then I promise I will do my best
to understand.

1029
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:11,332
Okay. The first thing you should know
about me is that I'm a sorcerer.

1030
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:15,336
Okay.

1031
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:19,757
I can conjure and shoot plasma bolts
out of my hand.

1032
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:22,718
I can speed time up, slow it down,

1033
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:27,181
varying degrees of levitation.
It's all very magical.

1034
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:33,145
And I thought my last boyfriend
was different 'cause he wore a scarf.

1035
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:42,989
- Baby, I'll just come back. Okay?
- Okay.

1036
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:46,534
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay. All right. I'm here.

1037
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:51,622
Bad time, Dave.

1038
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,457
Bennet. Thank God you answered.

1039
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,042
I got a real emergency on my hands.

1040
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,962
I need you to meet me
at my lab right now!

1041
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:02,717
- Becky, I got to let you out.
- What? Let me out?

1042
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:04,385
Okay.

1043
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,513
I think I know how to defeat them
without any magic.

1044
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:08,931
How?

1045
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:10,892
The rings on Horvath's cane.

1046
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:14,395
He put them there to gain more power,
but they make him a better conductor.

1047
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:17,857
Dave, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1048
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:20,985
All right, Rebecca, here it is.

1049
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:25,323
Many evil sorcerers will be
raised from the dead tonight.

1050
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:29,911
So, basically, Morgana is trying
to destroy the world as we know it.

1051
01:27:31,038 --> 01:27:32,371
Oh, just that.

1052
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:36,208
This is really dangerous.
I can't bring you into it.

1053
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,378
Well, I think I'm already into it.

1054
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:44,008
And besides, if you blow it,
we're all gonna die anyway, right?

1055
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,344
I want to come with you.

1056
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:49,639
You're sexy.

1057
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,728
- I got all the Tesla coil remotes.
- Thanks, brother. I appreciate it.

1058
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:58,272
Oh! I found this after we hung up.

1059
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:01,067
It was on the desk.

1060
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,236
"Give this to Veronica. Balthazar."

1061
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:14,288
I don't think Balthazar's planning
on coming back.

1062
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:19,001
I don't know
what you're into here, Dave,

1063
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:23,881
but whatever it is,
you are definitely participating!

1064
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,677
Thank you, Bennet. I appreciate that.
We should go.

1065
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,733
Now is The Rising.

1066
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:46,153
Now is the time.

1067
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:16,767
Veronica.

1068
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:22,189
It's me, Horvath. Morgana.

1069
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,443
No need to look so pathetic.

1070
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,071
Destroy that thing.

1071
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:31,365
I never want to see it again.

1072
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:37,079
I cannot raise the dead
until the circle is complete.

1073
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:06,317
- No way. Man alive!
- What?

1074
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:08,903
Are you telling me
you honestly don't see that?

1075
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:09,987
No. See what?

1076
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:12,990
I think they're using the satellite dishes
on the tops of the buildings

1077
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:15,743
to direct and amplify
the electromagnetic energy.

1078
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,411
All right, we're pulling over.
We're pulling over.

1079
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,834
Becky, I need you to do me a favor.

1080
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:27,505
I need you to go up
to the very top of that thing.

1081
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:30,007
Great.

1082
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:33,427
You got to move that antenna
and just disrupt the signal.

1083
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,179
Okay. Right.

1084
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:38,182
Hey, Becky.

1085
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:41,352
Do you remember that letter I wrote
when we were 10 years old?

1086
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:42,520
Friend or girlfriend?

1087
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,356
I never saw what you checked,

1088
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:48,275
so in case I die tonight,
could you please tell me?

1089
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:51,320
Don't die and I'll tell you.

1090
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,824
Oh, yeah, okay.

1091
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:30,234
Balthazar.

1092
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:37,491
- Enough of your old tricks, Balthazar.
- As you wish.

1093
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:50,588
Time was, things were pretty even
between us, Balthazar.

1094
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:52,923
As you can see,

1095
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:56,552
I've acquired some new jewelry.

1096
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,933
I'm coming, buddy.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1097
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:08,397
All right, what... What is this?
What am I looking at? No!

1098
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:13,068
And a walker. Of course she has a...

1099
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:15,196
Okay.

1100
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:18,240
Oh, boy.

1101
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:26,332
A matador gored by a bull
can take up to three days to die.

1102
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,543
Sounds unpleasant, doesn't it?

1103
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:18,175
The circle is nearly complete.

1104
01:33:18,677 --> 01:33:20,678
It must be awful, Balthazar.

1105
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:24,181
All these years,
fighting to stop this one moment

1106
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,517
and then coming up short.

1107
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,057
That's my car.

1108
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:25,242
Oh!

1109
01:34:25,327 --> 01:34:26,452
Thank you!

1110
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:38,172
We're too late.

1111
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:57,608
Veronica.

1112
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,280
Is she...

1113
01:35:05,784 --> 01:35:07,242
They're both still with us.

1114
01:35:36,022 --> 01:35:38,273
Balthazar, what have you done?

1115
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:40,818
What you did for me.

1116
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:46,615
Balthazar, no.

1117
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,992
You'll do whatever it takes
to destroy Morgana.

1118
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:52,830
No. No, I can't.
I won't lock you in this thing.

1119
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:54,498
Neither will I.

1120
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,000
How sweet.

1121
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:10,514
Oh, man.

1122
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:16,520
- And now we end this.
- No!

1123
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,485
No way.

1124
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:30,701
No ring.

1125
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:32,369
It is you.

1126
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,037
The Prime Merlinean!

1127
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:38,500
Fools!

1128
01:36:40,587 --> 01:36:41,879
Veronica!

1129
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:52,264
Now it's my turn.

1130
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:02,983
Is that the best that you can do?

1131
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:05,569
I sure hope not.

1132
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:27,257
And now it's my turn.

1133
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:52,241
Come on.

1134
01:37:58,873 --> 01:37:59,915
Climb.

1135
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:06,213
You have Merlin's powers,

1136
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:09,341
but you don't have his strength
or his skill.

1137
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:11,260
You are still weak.

1138
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:13,387
But I'm not alone.

1139
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:16,807
I brought a little science with me. Now!

1140
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:04,563
I did it! Balthazar, I actually did it!

1141
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,034
He's gone.

1142
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:23,290
He completed his quest.

1143
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:29,838
No, no, no, no.
It's not over. He can't die.

1144
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:32,591
I just... Not now.

1145
01:39:36,054 --> 01:39:37,262
Come on.

1146
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,491
That's not good enough.

1147
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:02,788
Veronica, would you please step back?

1148
01:40:03,581 --> 01:40:06,750
If Morgana can stop his heart,
maybe I can start it.

1149
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:15,884
All right, here we go, bud.
Here we go. Listen.

1150
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:19,304
You... You with all your stupid rules!

1151
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:21,932
And all those old man shoes.

1152
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:24,685
And your constantly saving me
with that look in your eyes.

1153
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:28,313
Come on!

1154
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:33,610
Come on.

1155
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:48,166
I had a dream.

1156
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:55,424
You were insulting me, Dave.
Repeatedly.

1157
01:40:56,175 --> 01:40:59,136
Me? That's pretty weird, huh?

1158
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:02,472
No, kind of makes sense.

1159
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:03,640
Yeah.

1160
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,731
- Thank you.
- Welcome back, old man.

1161
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,400
You're here.

1162
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:37,883
Dave!

1163
01:41:42,305 --> 01:41:45,682
- You did it!
- I know. And I'm still alive.

1164
01:41:45,767 --> 01:41:47,976
And, surprisingly, so am I.

1165
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:51,354
I know. Oh, the note. Right.

1166
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:53,356
- Friend or girlfriend?
- I don't care.

1167
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:01,531
Girlfriend. Definitely girlfriend.

1168
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:10,665
Would you like to have breakfast
with me? In France?

1169
01:42:11,334 --> 01:42:12,375
France?

1170
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:17,589
Yeah, I got us a ride.

1171
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:20,217
Okay, you're fun.

1172
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:29,142
Becky, there's something I forgot
to mention to you.

1173
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:32,145
I really have no idea
how to land this thing.
