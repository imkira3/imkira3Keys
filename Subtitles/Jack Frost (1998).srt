4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,483
We're going to do
a Christmas tune for you now.

5
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,445
You got to trust me. This one's
just a little bit different.

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,406
It combines the Christmas
colors, red...

7
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:32,866
...green...

8
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,785
...and blues!

9
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,484
Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly, happy soul

10
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:13,490
He was smoking his pipe, baby
His two eyes were made of coal

11
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,246
And Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairy tale they say

12
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,960
He was made of ice and snow
Then he came to life one day

13
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,175
Frosty the Snowman
Was as bad as he could be

14
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,178
And the children say
He could laugh and play

15
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,306
Just the same as you and me

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,442
Man, check it out.

17
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,416
It's the Jack Frost Band.

18
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,629
They're digging it. They're loving it.
We gotta sign these guys.

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,316
There must've been some magic
In the air that night

20
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,946
For that old silk cap they found

21
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,741
For when

22
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:41,245
They laid it upon his head

23
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,871
He began

24
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,209
To hootchy-koo around

25
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,128
And Frosty the Snowman

26
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,006
Is a fairy tale they say

27
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:56,176
He was made of ice and snow

28
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,886
Till he came...

29
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:58,971
...to...

30
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,389
...life...

31
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,308
...one day

32
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:21,326
That was Medford's own Jack Frost Band.
Best band no one's ever heard of.

33
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,580
That's recorded live last night
at Denver's Music Hall.

34
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,375
Don't ask how we got the tape.
They are due for a break.

35
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,669
We got more music coming
from the '70s and '90s.

36
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,046
No '60s. No '80s. I promise.

37
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,549
Central Colorado's classic rock.

38
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,365
School's out!

39
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,375
No running. Feet are for walking.

40
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,629
Merry Christmas, everybody.
See you next year!

41
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,881
Merry Christmas, Miss Moon.

42
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,550
Hey, Charlie.

43
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,511
Happy vacation, Charlie.

44
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,556
Snowball fight!

45
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,157
- The brain's here.
- What's going on?

46
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,951
The 7th graders have us pinned down.

47
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,869
They're using the heavy artillery!

48
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,955
Come on, how bad could it be?

49
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,040
Two, three, launch!

50
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,170
What was that?

51
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,005
Bull's-eye!

52
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,299
- We tried to tell you.
- Rory Buck.

53
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,134
Alexander!

54
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,055
Help him!

55
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,057
Natalie, help!

56
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,730
Eat snow, you little wieners.

57
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,820
Huddle up. Come on.

58
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,322
Remember what we learned
in history class?

59
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,449
- No.
- Not really.

60
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,162
If you want to stop an army,
stop the general.

61
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,789
You're taking on Rory Buck?

62
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,499
Trust me, Tuck, all right?

63
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,209
You draw their fire.

64
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:35,794
Good luck, man.

65
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,129
Fire!

66
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,177
Get him!

67
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,095
I dare you to hit me.

68
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:50,726
Load me up.

69
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,440
- Are you all right?
- No.

70
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,317
Come on. Give me your best shot.

71
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,319
Can't you do better than that?

72
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,906
Okay, that was a good one.

73
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,616
Go now! Go, run!

74
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,327
Wait!

75
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,538
Come on, Alexander!

76
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,540
What did you do that for, butthead?

77
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,584
That little twerp's getting away!

78
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,670
Run like the wind, Alexander!

79
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,675
Are you okay?

80
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,678
I'll take care of this one myself.

81
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,561
Hold your fire.

82
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,438
Rory's pissed!

83
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,568
Well, well, well.
Little Charlie Frost.

84
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,738
- Hanging with the second graders now?
- Get off, Rory.

85
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,991
I got a present for you.

86
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,035
Nail him, Rory.

87
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,287
Good, I like presents.

88
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,458
Can you say, "brain freeze"?

89
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,170
Brain freeze.

90
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,464
Way to go, buddy.

91
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,592
All right, Charlie.

92
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,303
This isn't the end of it, Frost.

93
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,349
Oh, yeah! Way to go!

94
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:16,812
Shut up!

95
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,317
You okay? Good man.

96
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,403
Thanks, Charlie. You're amazing.

97
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,612
No problem.

98
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,034
See you at hockey, Charlie.

99
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,370
- See you, Natalie.
- Good job, dude.

100
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,080
See you later.

101
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,025
Hey, Chester.

102
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,776
Come on, boy.

103
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,447
Dad?

104
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:23,587
Hi, Mom.

105
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,424
It's a long drive from Denver.
You know he won't be back until late.

106
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,718
This drain, I don't get it.

107
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,262
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes it doesn't.

108
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,474
So?

109
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,892
So?

110
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,729
So not turning over your report card
right away is a bad sign.

111
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,732
Here.

112
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,110
I'm going to play hockey
in the driveway.

113
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,489
Running away. That's another bad sign.

114
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,703
You may have your father's looks,
but you get your brains from me.

115
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,123
Good work, Charlie.

116
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,376
Wait till your dad sees this.

117
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,055
Excuse me, miss?

118
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,269
Listen, my car broke down back here.

119
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,564
Can I borrow a couple of bucks
till I get to a gas station?

120
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,066
Money? I'm sorry.
My husband's a musician.

121
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,317
Really?

122
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,820
- Is he any good?
- Yeah.

123
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,113
Really?

124
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,992
You know, I also left
my lip balm in the car.

125
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,121
So I'm out, and I think
I'm feeling a little...

126
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,873
Chapped?

127
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,959
I wonder if I could
borrow some lip balm?

128
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,670
I don't know if you'll like what I got.

129
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,089
Do you mind if I try?

130
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,015
- You like it?
- You know, I can't tell.

131
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,808
Let me just...

132
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,813
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

133
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,608
Okay, that's for you.
What's for me?

134
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,736
I hope you brought me chocolates.
Yes!

135
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,697
He waited as long as he could.

136
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,117
- Let's get him up.
- No. Don't get him up.

137
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,577
Come on.

138
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,039
He's got the whole vacation to sleep.
Come on.

139
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,168
Dude? Charlie-boy?

140
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,503
Charlie-boy.

141
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:28,587
Dad?

142
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,880
Get up, man.

143
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,633
I was just resting my eyes.

144
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,092
You were?

145
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,845
You looked asleep. Didn't he?

146
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,931
You looked like you were asleep.

147
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,643
- Exactly like you were sleeping.
- No, I was waiting up for you.

148
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,355
Okay, you can go back to sleep.
I just wanted to say hi.

149
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,107
I want to give you
a weather update too.

150
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,068
It's snowing!

151
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:54,780
Can I, Mom?

152
00:10:58,784 --> 00:10:59,952
Can I, Mom?

153
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,458
Dad, not another fathead.

154
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,960
He's not a fathead.

155
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,463
He's just smart, so he needs
a big cranium for his brain.

156
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,548
Now what?

157
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,508
Nose. Come on, nose.

158
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,806
I said "nose"!

159
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,683
I thought you said "hose".

160
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,101
Sorry.

161
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,275
Scarf.

162
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,279
Give me your hat.

163
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,322
Thank you.

164
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,242
Yes. Perfect.

165
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,368
How's he look?

166
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,578
He Looks like you.

167
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,704
He does?

168
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,539
Only a little cuter.

169
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,207
Good one, Mom.

170
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:50,711
Really?

171
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,254
Really.

172
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,631
Cuter than this?

173
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,550
Don't even...

174
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,886
You are...

175
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,763
...so dead!

176
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,395
You know what?
You throw like a girl.

177
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,982
Welcome home, Jack!

178
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,901
Now go to sleep!

179
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,653
Sorry, Mrs. Wilkins.

180
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,447
Sorry, Mrs. Wilkins.

181
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,949
Hey, seriously, from this angle...

182
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,327
...she looks hot
in that flannel nightgown...

183
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,963
Pulling an all nighter?

184
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,550
Get your skinny little butt
in that bed.

185
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,803
Nice work on that snowman, dude.

186
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:42,971
Thanks.

187
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,474
- Except you made his head way too big.
- I did?

188
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,143
You put the bottom ball
on the top ball.

189
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,645
- How you doing?
- Good.

190
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,231
- How was Denver?
- Denver's pretty cool.

191
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,774
Cool. How're the guys?

192
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,817
They're great.
Everybody says hi.

193
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,319
So?

194
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,529
So?

195
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,864
Is there anything you need to show me?

196
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:01,949
Like?

197
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,700
Like something in the shape...

198
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,953
...of a present.

199
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:07,204
Like from the gig?

200
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,874
Like those plastic swords they
stick through the olives and onions?

201
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,294
Yeah, Like for the martinis
Mom packs in my lunch.

202
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:15,796
Mom's making you martinis?

203
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,339
- I'm up to two now.
- Good.

204
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,423
Two a day.

205
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,260
I brought you this.

206
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,271
One of your harmonicas?

207
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,442
That's one of my old harmonicas.

208
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,736
Sure you want me to have this?

209
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,905
Absolutely I want you to have it.

210
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,657
Where'd you get it?

211
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,075
Where'd I get it?

212
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,036
I got that from...

213
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:51,915
...an old famous blues player named
Sonny Boy Wayne.

214
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,209
- Yeah, right.
- I did.

215
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,294
Sonny Boy Wayne.

216
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:59,715
He was 9 feet tall and could play, man.
There was a white light around him.

217
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:00,841
And he gave you this?

218
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,844
He did. He said,
"Son, I want you to have this.

219
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,471
It'll give you the power".

220
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,682
Come on, seriously.
Where'd you get it?

221
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,100
You want to know?

222
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,060
I got that...

223
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,188
...the morning you were born.

224
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,772
Really?

225
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,400
Little music store
across from the hospital.

226
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,154
I walked out in a great mood,
bought myself that harmonica.

227
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,781
And I never had a harmonica
that played better.

228
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,408
My favorite one.

229
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,328
- Now it's yours.
- Thanks.

230
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,456
You're welcome. Now go to sleep.

231
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,832
Son...

232
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,126
...I want you to go to sleep now.

233
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,255
It's awesome!

234
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,634
Okay, see you in the morning.

235
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,054
We play hockey tomorrow.
Can you come?

236
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:51,850
Yes, sir. Wait a minute, I can't.
We have to go into the studio.

237
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,102
Well, the game's not till four.

238
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,605
And it's against
our arch rivals, the Devils.

239
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,066
You're 1 1. You already have arch rivals?

240
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,904
Four. Yeah, what am I thinking?
I'm there. I'm there.

241
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,072
Definitely.

242
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,365
Great.

243
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,494
You know another thing about this
harmonica? It has magic powers.

244
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,954
Yeah, right.

245
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:13,121
I'm serious.

246
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,916
When you play that,
no matter where I am...

247
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,584
...I can hear it.

248
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,169
Right.

249
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,295
I'm telling you.

250
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:21,755
Good night.

251
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,216
Love you. Go to sleep.

252
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,265
You looking for the power?

253
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:32,641
Just testing it.

254
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,399
A major label? What do you think
of this Kaplan kid?

255
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,943
I Like him. He's smart.
He really knows music.

256
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,196
And you know what?
I think this guy really gets us.

257
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:47,906
Oh, good.

258
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,616
How's things at the bank?

259
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,202
How's that new guy
in the loan department?

260
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,788
Glenn? He's a nice guy.

261
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:56,498
He hit on me.

262
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,459
Really?

263
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,381
How about that? Guys don't even
check for rings anymore.

264
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,467
Relax. He's 63.
I straightened him out.

265
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,470
You straightened him out?
What exactly does that mean?

266
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,389
Stop it.

267
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,433
No wonder he hit on you.
Look at you.

268
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,977
I don't wear this to the bank.

269
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,062
You're barely wearing it here.

270
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,524
Sing me a smile.

271
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,989
Well, the driver on the bus says,
"Move on back..."

272
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,908
No, sing me the other one.

273
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,576
My song.

274
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,787
Every time

275
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,081
We say goodbye

276
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,919
I die a little

277
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:43,921
Take off your boots.

278
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,215
Every time

279
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,717
We say goodbye

280
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,720
Oh, man, if I had one hit song...

281
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,847
You will.

282
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,766
I'd make you guys proud of me.

283
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,560
We're already really proud of you.

284
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,524
- Buy you a nice big house.
- I'd settle for a new sink.

285
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,527
I can get you a new car,
like a Porsche.

286
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,780
Anything but a Jeep is a sissy car.

287
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,742
I'd get you some diamonds.

288
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,791
All I need is you.

289
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,552
I love you, Gab.

290
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,762
I Love you too.

291
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,398
'Cause when you're near

292
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,608
There's such an air

293
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,652
Of spring

294
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,612
About it

295
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,994
I bet you would Like
a snow blower, though.

296
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:16,722
Lift it up.

297
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,933
I don't remember you hanging
this many lights last year.

298
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,019
That's because I didn't hang this many.

299
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,980
Little straighter.
Yours is crooked on that side.

300
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,566
If you come down a bit at your end...

301
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,027
You've come too far now.

302
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,531
See, you've gone too far there...

303
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,450
Be careful, Mac.

304
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,661
You don't want to be on the wrong end
of that left hook.

305
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,164
Bye, baby.

306
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,874
I'll be in the car.

307
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,626
Front of the goal, shoots.

308
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:46,835
Hit the post.

309
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,880
A little wide. But nice shot.
Who taught you that shot?

310
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,048
Coach Gronic.

311
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,883
Dicky Gronic?

312
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,552
Dicky Gronic is your coach?
He can't play hockey.

313
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,970
Dad, Sid Gronic.

314
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:00,098
Sid Gronic's good.
Sid Gronic's very good.

315
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:03,393
He's one of the best,
if he could stay out of prison.

316
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,190
What was that?

317
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,567
That's something I call the "J-shot".

318
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,110
- Teach me.
- Come here.

319
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,280
You're big enough to handle this now.

320
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,367
- We got to go.
- Be with you in one second.

321
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,327
Hold on a minute.

322
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,497
Say the guy's coming down
right here, defensive man.

323
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,999
Bring it on the stick's toe.
Back to the heel.

324
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,084
Now cut loose.

325
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,795
There you go. Nice shot.
Very good.

326
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,173
- I still don't get it.
- I'll show you when I come back.

327
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,050
But I need it for today's game.

328
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,760
Teach you when I come back.

329
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,345
But, Dad, I want to...

330
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,638
"Butt Dad"?

331
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,266
Did you just call me "Butt Dad"?

332
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,602
Is that the kind of thing
Coach Gronic teaches you? Butt Dad?

333
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,355
By the way, that would
make you Butt Boy. Bye.

334
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,023
Bye, Butt Family.

335
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,902
See you in a while.

336
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,737
Love you guys. Bye.

337
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,575
All right.

338
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,453
Oh, man.

339
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,291
First period's behind us.

340
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,669
Forget about it.
God knows I'm going to try.

341
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,297
I know you're just kids.

342
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,382
And we're really here to teach you...

343
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,677
...fair play and sportsmanship
and all that crap.

344
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:23,515
But I am so tired of Looking
up at that scoreboard...

345
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,393
...and seeing that we're behind
the Devils again...

346
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:27,644
...and again...

347
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,271
...and again...

348
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,732
Lighten up, Dad.

349
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,066
Sorry.

350
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,613
History is made by winners.

351
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,281
Conquerors.

352
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,283
Barbarians.

353
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,328
Now, I want you to go out there...

354
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,832
...and wipe the ice
with their filthy butts!

355
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:49,917
All right?!

356
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,337
Play clean.
Have a good game.

357
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,381
Come on, guys.
Let's whup them!

358
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,260
Hey, Rory.

359
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,262
Hey, sweetheart. Miss me?

360
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:08,268
Let's nail it this time. You're
getting tighter. We're almost there.

361
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,217
Come on, Charlie!

362
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,453
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

363
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,998
- Good luck, Jack.
- Afraid I'm going to need it.

364
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,959
- See you Later.
- All right, man. Thanks.

365
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,964
I hope it's not bad.

366
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:05,219
How bad is it in there?

367
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,888
Yeah, that's what I thought.

368
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,951
- Something smells good...
- You promised him.

369
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,119
Why'd you go and do that, Jack?

370
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:36,083
I've told you. If you're not going
to be there, don't say you will be.

371
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,126
You know how I knew you promised him?

372
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,462
He kept Looking at me up in the stands.

373
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,297
And after about the 40th time...

374
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,759
...I realized he expected you
to be there.

375
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:51,765
I don't care if you get too busy
or you flake out on me.

376
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,476
Well, I care, but I chose it.

377
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,603
I married you. I'll deal with it.

378
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,189
He didn't choose this.

379
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,401
One of these days,
Charlie will score his first goal...

380
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,612
...and you won't see it.
Like you never saw his measles...

381
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:09,074
...or the time he jammed
Fig Newtons into the projector.

382
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,535
Those things only happen once.

383
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,121
Don't, Jack. You said enough.

384
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:22,504
Hey, buddy.

385
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,223
How'd you guys do?

386
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:36,560
Got killed. Eight-zip.

387
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,699
I'm really sorry I didn't make it.

388
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,577
I'm really sorry, man.

389
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,747
Hey, look...

390
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:04,421
I got to talk to you about something...

391
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:07,925
...that's really important.

392
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,766
You know how you always wanted to be
the next Wayne Gretzky?

393
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,352
I always had a dream too.

394
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,771
Ever since I was about your age...

395
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:23,190
...I just really wanted
to be a great musician.

396
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,776
I just wanted to be a real player.

397
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,154
I wanted to make a living
doing what I Love.

398
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:32,866
And I really want to make
a nice Living for you, me and Mom.

399
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,285
Well, see...

400
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,204
...that might be...

401
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,456
...kind of starting to happen.

402
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,333
That's good, Dad.

403
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,626
Yeah, it is good.

404
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:46,547
And it's really, really good
for you to have a dream.

405
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,383
Tricky part here is sometimes...

406
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,760
...if you're not careful, you can...

407
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,681
...I don't know, kind of turn
into kind of a...

408
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:57,057
Selfish jerk?

409
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,604
All right.

410
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,774
Yeah.

411
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,236
So are all musicians really flaky?

412
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,992
Yeah, basically, I think.

413
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:17,953
All the drummers.

414
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,499
Okay, here's an idea.

415
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,793
I've thought about this one
for a while.

416
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:28,964
You, me, Mom,
we go to the cabin up at Pine Top.

417
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,758
We have a real Christmas vacation,
just us.

418
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,387
No phone, no TV, no band, nothing.
What do you think?

419
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:36,972
Really?

420
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,183
Will you teach me the J-shot?

421
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:40,726
I will teach you the J-shot.

422
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,645
Hold on a second. No TV?

423
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,064
Yeah, I know.
I was thinking about that too.

424
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:47,482
Maybe a Little TV.

425
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:49,943
Okay, cool.

426
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,487
So, eight-oh...

427
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:54,823
How bad was it?

428
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,242
I think Coach Gronic popped a vein.

429
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:04,458
- Here, hon, let me get that bag.
- I forgave you last night.

430
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,710
- Then can you grab one of these?
- Nope.

431
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:08,879
What's in there, a dead body?

432
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,382
No, it's just, like, Gameboy,
batteries, food, clothes...

433
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,676
We'll only be up there
three days.

434
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,513
We could get snowed in for months.
You'll thank me.

435
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:19,973
Grab the phone, will you?

436
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,522
Hello?

437
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,357
Yeah, sure, hold on a second.

438
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:29,441
It's for you.

439
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,777
John Kaplan?

440
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:36,865
I'll meet you in the car.

441
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,581
I just got this...

442
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,293
...kind of unbelievable phone call.

443
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,798
The record company heard our tape...

444
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,466
...went nuts.

445
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,347
Oh, honey!

446
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:01,849
Dad, this is awesome!

447
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:03,267
That's great!

448
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,519
- You think?
- What's the matter?

449
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,689
Well, the head of Asylum
has to see us.

450
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,775
He'll only sign one act.
There's 3 other bands...

451
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,028
...and he'll only sign us
if we go to his party in Aspen.

452
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,113
When?

453
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:18,615
Tomorrow.

454
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,117
Christmas?

455
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,286
I know.

456
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,372
There's got to be another time
he can see you.

457
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,333
According to Kaplan,
there is no other time. This is it.

458
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:31,336
Don't worry. Forget about it.
It's too hard, because...

459
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:32,880
Hold on a second.

460
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,381
I don't even want to go.

461
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,508
Let's see if we can work this out.

462
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,719
I mean, how Long
do you have to play?

463
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:43,390
I don't know. That's a good point.
Could maybe play a half an hour.

464
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,728
Don't play a whole set. They can tell
how you sound in a few songs.

465
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:48,812
Get out...

466
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,899
Maybe I could borrow Mac's car.
I could drive back.

467
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:54,401
That way I could be back
by Christmas night.

468
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,321
But I'll miss Christmas Day for sure.

469
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,572
Here.

470
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,911
What's this?
I gave this to you.

471
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:05,495
I don't want it.

472
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,567
This is going to be a great gig, man.

473
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:39,571
We'll rock this guy's house and
blow it apart. He'll have to remodel.

474
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:42,491
This is the one. I'm telling you.
This is a good thing.

475
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:52,209
- So when do you want me to pull over?
- Right now. Over here.

476
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:55,587
What am I, crazy? I got a great wife.
I got a great kid.

477
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:58,215
I'm not living this life anymore.
I'm going home.

478
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,509
Good.
You're making the right decision.

479
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,136
If they like us now,
they'll like us next week.

480
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,597
It's Christmas.
They can mail us the contract.

481
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:11,061
- How do I explain this to the guys?
- Are you nuts? Watch this.

482
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,188
Hey, guys.

483
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,149
- The gig's off.
- Thank you, Santa.

484
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:19,653
Nobody wanted to come. Lou's mom
wants to cook Christmas dinner.

485
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,280
Yes, Merry Christmas, boys.

486
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,198
I'm going to see my family.

487
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:26,702
This is great! I'll take
the 40 to Highway 2, and then...

488
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,081
Why don't you take the car?

489
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,292
It'd be so much faster that way.

490
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,531
Oh, man!

491
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,950
Now, where did he say that spot was?

492
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:09,995
There it is.

493
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,206
Come on, Mac.

494
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,264
Merry Christmas.
Have a great vacation.

495
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:11,598
Merry Christmas.

496
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,559
Thanks.

497
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,311
Feet are for walking!

498
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,867
Frost. You big butthead.

499
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,077
Forget it, Rory.

500
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:35,247
He's no fun to pick on anymore
since his old man died.

501
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,749
Yeah? Well, it's time
he gets over it.

502
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,335
I never even met my old man.

503
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:54,349
- Want a lift home?
- No, I'm not going home.

504
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,351
You shouldn't walk in the road.

505
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:58,353
No one's around. It's all right.

506
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,981
Okay, well, I'll see you tonight.

507
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,649
Why?

508
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,901
I'm baby-sitting.

509
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:07,237
Well, not baby-sitting.
You're not a baby.

510
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:10,032
We can hang out
while your mom Christmas shops.

511
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,868
All right.

512
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,789
See you later, Charlie.

513
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,697
Sorry, dude!

514
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:52,741
Damn it!

515
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,998
Damn it!

516
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:22,479
I can drive through it.

517
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:23,772
I can get it.

518
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:25,232
Really, it's okay.

519
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:26,984
No, it's not okay. Hold on.

520
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:35,742
It's okay. It's okay.

521
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:39,621
Charlie, it's okay. It's okay.

522
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:51,800
I miss him too. I miss him too.

523
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:05,314
It's going to be okay, honey.
I promise.

524
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,578
Here you go.

525
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,079
Thanks.

526
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,291
How you doing, little bear?

527
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,293
Fine.

528
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,462
I'll stay home. We'll hang out.

529
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,756
No, Mom, I'll be fine.

530
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:33,133
I've done my Christmas shopping.
I'm good.

531
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,968
No, me and Mac'll be fine.

532
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:39,139
Want a marshmallow?

533
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:42,017
What do you want? One?

534
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:44,728
Two?

535
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:47,314
Maybe four?

536
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,734
Maybe all 500?

537
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,444
Thanks, Mom.

538
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,541
Your dad loved this guy.

539
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:10,128
They even played together
a couple of times.

540
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:13,799
Nice to know he had
time for someone.

541
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,478
Come on, Dad, put the head on.

542
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:29,147
Now, okay, Natalie,
pack some snow in there.

543
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:32,985
Let's go in the house.
Come on. It's getting cold.

544
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:35,904
I'm going to get you now.
Gotcha!

545
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:01,962
I'm home!

546
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,049
Hey, I'm home.

547
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:24,693
Man, it's cold!

548
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,156
Could you open up?

549
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,008
Charlie, it's me.
It's Dad!

550
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:55,015
Could you get the door?

551
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:04,608
What?!

552
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:07,694
No.

553
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:13,784
No way!

554
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,129
Can't be.

555
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:35,889
What is that?

556
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:41,270
Hey! Come on!
That's disgusting!

557
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:43,355
Chester, it's me.

558
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:44,731
It's me. It's Jack!

559
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:52,406
- Chester just peed on a live snowman!
- No cranberries.

560
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:54,116
What?

561
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:55,659
This is not happening.

562
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:57,369
This cannot be happening!

563
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:00,038
Can you let me in?

564
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,541
Charlie, look...

565
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,961
I'm having kind of a bad day here.

566
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:07,546
Come on, Mac.

567
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,217
This ought to do it.

568
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,056
Kiddo, it's getting cold!

569
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:26,648
That's my branch!

570
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:29,610
Okay, come on.

571
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,695
Come on. Come on!

572
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:33,197
This is unbelievable.

573
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,782
When I was a human, nothing.

574
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:37,951
Now all of a sudden
you want to play?

575
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,412
Come on, Chester...

576
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:48,086
That's the coldest wedgie
I ever had.

577
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:50,964
Well, look what we have here.

578
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:52,966
Let me pick up my...

579
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:54,051
...arm.

580
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,143
Is that a snowplow?

581
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:12,110
Excuse me. Hello!

582
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:15,656
I'm on the front of your plow,
Mr. Snowplow Driver!

583
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:25,707
Big headache!

584
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:43,934
Wonderful service.
Thanks for the lift.

585
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:48,063
Come on, shake it off.
It's just snow.

586
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:56,947
Great.

587
00:44:57,573 --> 00:45:00,158
Talk about your separation anxiety.

588
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:04,246
Hey, you!
Ball number two.

589
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:06,957
Don't just sit there.
Give me a hand.

590
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:08,834
Okay, that's it.

591
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,377
Come on, no.

592
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,171
Get the mitten out of my eye.

593
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:13,463
No, that's my nose.

594
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:15,507
That's my cork!

595
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,634
There we go.
Got it. Got it.

596
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:19,887
Now watch it.
Okay, one, two...

597
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:21,722
...three!

598
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:24,391
I'm getting dizzy.

599
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:28,020
Man!

600
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,690
Something's missing.

601
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:39,031
Nice work, ball number three.

602
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:45,913
Man, it's bad enough
my ticket got punched...

603
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,791
...but to come back like this!
It's embarrassing.

604
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:58,842
I've put myself back together
after some rough nights...

605
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:01,053
...but this is ridiculous.

606
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:07,559
Don't panic.
Just act real casual.

607
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,563
Yeah, just act casual.

608
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:15,067
Wait a minute. I'm a snowman.

609
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:16,902
There you go.

610
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,495
Hello there.

611
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:30,832
Maybe Charlie's snapping out of it.

612
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,758
It's good to see these again.

613
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,307
Let's get you bundled up.
It's going to be a cold one.

614
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:06,535
Back off!

615
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:10,247
- What's going on?
- I'm so glad to see you.

616
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:16,420
Have you been watching
the Sci-Fi Channel again?

617
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:18,463
Gabby, you're back.

618
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:21,091
Charlie's been great all evening.

619
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:24,344
- What happened here?
- I was thinking the same thing.

620
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:25,679
It's the snowman.

621
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:28,015
I saw it. Terrific job!

622
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:29,725
No! Mom, he's alive!

623
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:33,395
Well, I'd better be going.

624
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:36,773
Not so fast.
Honey, are you sure you're okay?

625
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:40,777
I swear, he came to life,
waddled into the street...

626
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:42,738
...and a snowplow took him away!

627
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:49,077
Well...

628
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,663
...I guess it got a cab back, then.

629
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:52,998
What?

630
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:57,503
How...?

631
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:00,214
Thanks, Mac.

632
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:01,924
You're welcome.

633
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:04,635
Good work!

634
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:24,905
You look good.

635
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:29,785
Oh, man...

636
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,746
...I never did fix that.

637
00:48:57,688 --> 00:48:59,648
Oh, man, why me?

638
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:01,817
Why a snowman?

639
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:05,988
I mean, could the universe
really be that unoriginal?

640
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:08,407
I don't know.

641
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:10,617
Is it the name Jack Frost?

642
00:49:10,868 --> 00:49:13,912
Because if that's it,
that's not even clever.

643
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,750
I should accept it.
I'm a frozen freak of nature.

644
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:20,836
I just want to know why.

645
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:24,298
I'm just...
Could you just give me...

646
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:28,385
Could I just have some kind of sign?

647
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:30,554
What the...?

648
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,558
Well, at least it's not a snowplow.

649
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:39,688
Sid? Sid Gronic?

650
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:41,732
Sid, is that you?

651
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:46,153
Been hearing great things about you.
Seriously.

652
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,282
Sid, come here!
Wait, wait, wait!

653
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,495
Where you going?

654
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:57,247
Wait.

655
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:00,626
Thanks for the help, Sid!

656
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,715
All right, wait a minute.
I just have to pull this together.

657
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:11,637
When I saw my reflection, I denied it.
That was my denial period.

658
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,138
I go off on Sid.

659
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,724
Clearly, I've had my anger period.

660
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:19,978
That's what they say you do.
First you deny, then you go into anger.

661
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,397
I just have to accept it.

662
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:25,651
I accept I'm a snowman.

663
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,322
Sid!

664
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:53,178
All right.

665
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:54,930
Come on.

666
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,225
Just a regular snowman, huh?

667
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:00,894
We'll see about that.

668
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:08,902
Who are you and what do you want?

669
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:11,947
Talk, or I'll
turn you into a puddle.

670
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,491
I know you're alive.

671
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:16,827
So you better...

672
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:18,954
...start...

673
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,081
...talking.

674
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:23,292
That thing's hot.

675
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:25,252
What are you doing?
I'm your father.

676
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:26,628
Okay, you're grounded.

677
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:28,881
Come here.

678
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:31,758
Charlie, it's me! Dad!
Honest.

679
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:34,720
- I can explain everything.
- Get away from me!

680
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,973
I can't explain the part about
me being a snowman, but...

681
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:45,063
Go pick on someone as dumb as you.

682
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:46,940
As dumb as me?

683
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:54,448
- Good one, Rory.
- Give it back!

684
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:55,949
Spin move.

685
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:59,119
Right here, right here,
right here.

686
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:00,829
Oh, look.

687
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:03,373
It's our little hero.

688
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,628
Don't worry about him anymore.
He's not even in the game.

689
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:10,130
You're so immature.

690
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,132
Come on, give it back.

691
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,176
Give it back.

692
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,682
Did you guys see that?

693
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:25,020
So you do want a piece of me.

694
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,189
Thought you learned your lesson.

695
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:33,403
Kid, how's it going?

696
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:35,739
What are you doing here?

697
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:38,700
Guess it's time for a
refresher course.

698
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:44,790
Okay, snowball fight?

699
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:49,753
You picked the wrong area
to mess with me, and that's snow.

700
00:52:57,594 --> 00:53:00,639
Three balls, two sticks,
one cork nose. Snowman? No.

701
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:03,433
Much, much more.
I am the Wizard of Blizzard!

702
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:08,647
Now run!
Run, you little mountain goats!

703
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:19,408
Boy, the old Wizard
could use a nap.

704
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:22,369
I'm out of gas.

705
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:23,704
Run!

706
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:25,747
Let's get him!

707
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:33,463
Hold up.

708
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:36,258
He's not going anywhere.

709
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:39,928
Where are you going to go now, Frost?

710
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:48,729
Be careful!

711
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:54,193
Help!

712
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:55,319
Just hold on!

713
00:53:57,154 --> 00:53:58,697
I'm coming. I'm coming!

714
00:54:03,452 --> 00:54:04,620
I'm coming, Charlie!

715
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:06,496
I can't hold on!

716
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:10,918
Hold on. I'm coming.

717
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:12,586
What are you doing?

718
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:14,838
Don't you worry. I'm coming!

719
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:22,095
Told you I was coming.

720
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:28,143
You know, sometimes
it's good to have a big butt.

721
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:29,811
Let's get out of here!

722
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:35,108
There he is!

723
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,027
Let's get him!

724
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:40,656
Come on, guys.
Go, go, go!

725
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:42,741
You steer.

726
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:43,951
I'll scream.

727
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,041
Do something!

728
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,251
Zap them into ice.

729
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:56,338
Zap them into ice? Get real!
I don't even have pockets.

730
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:05,347
Duck, Charlie!

731
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:14,189
That'll cool him off.

732
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:17,860
Hold on!

733
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:18,986
I am holding on.

734
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:29,162
You the man!

735
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:31,039
No, you the man.

736
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,250
I'm the snowman.

737
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:37,963
We're safe!

738
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:42,342
Okay, we're not safe.

739
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:45,596
What's going on?

740
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:47,514
Nothing.

741
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:50,100
I don't think so.

742
00:55:58,108 --> 00:55:59,193
All right!

743
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:34,144
Look out!

744
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:53,956
Time to split.

745
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,626
I'll see you at the bottom.

746
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,563
I slimmed down!

747
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:23,485
Shredding.

748
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:27,489
Big air!

749
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:29,241
Right behind you, Frost.

750
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:34,997
Pull your vehicle over.

751
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:36,039
Snowman!

752
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:38,834
Perfect.

753
00:57:57,853 --> 00:57:59,271
Here we go.

754
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:00,898
Catch some air, baby!

755
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:02,524
This is awesome!

756
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:07,863
Look out.
Look out for the trees!

757
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:10,782
- Carving time!
- I'm behind you!

758
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:12,075
Big carves.

759
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:17,080
- We were ripping!
- That was cool.

760
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:19,208
- That was great.
- Did you see that?

761
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:21,418
One time, thank you.

762
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:24,588
Did you see me going down?
The nice thing about big...

763
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:27,674
...balls, excuse me, is look how
you can move around them.

764
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:29,843
I like the roundedness.

765
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:33,305
You can throw your weight over
on this side of the board.

766
00:58:33,764 --> 00:58:35,599
- Better than being skinny.
- Hold on.

767
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:39,686
- You almost got me killed.
- I saved your butt too, pal.

768
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:43,106
So I'm supposed to believe
you're my dad?

769
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,317
Do me a favor. Go easy on me.

770
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:48,695
Because I'm having trouble
dealing with it myself, okay?

771
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:49,863
You know...

772
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:51,573
...he died a year ago.

773
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:53,450
I know. I was there.

774
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:55,452
You're nuts.

775
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:58,539
Great. He doesn't believe me.

776
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:00,541
It's not enough I got...

777
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:03,043
...these stick arms
and this humongous butt.

778
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,670
And that dippy walk.

779
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,755
What's wrong with my walk?
Is it that bad?

780
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,383
All right.

781
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,635
So you're my dad, huh?

782
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:14,096
How did my hamster die?

783
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:17,140
Your hamster? Heart attack.

784
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:18,559
Vacuum cleaner.

785
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:20,060
Well, yeah, but...

786
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,813
I'll bet it had a heart attack
on the way in.

787
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:24,773
All right.

788
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:26,316
What's my hockey position?

789
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,318
That's easy. Right wing.

790
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:30,445
- Wrong.
- What? You're a wing.

791
00:59:30,696 --> 00:59:32,656
They moved me to defense last year.

792
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:34,366
Oh, man, Charlie-boy.

793
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:38,120
I'm sorry. Defense is a good position,
but you're a natural winger.

794
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:41,039
Hold on.
What'd you call me?

795
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:43,083
I said...

796
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,127
..."Charlie-boy".

797
00:59:45,836 --> 00:59:48,589
That's what I always call you.
Charlie-boy.

798
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:50,966
Dad?

799
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:55,512
Dad!

800
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:02,477
It is me, Charlie.
I'm back.

801
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:08,400
Hold on.
This is really weird.

802
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:10,485
I just hugged a snowman.

803
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:12,946
You played on the magic harmonica.

804
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:15,199
What? Magic harmonica?

805
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,075
I thought you made that up!

806
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:18,869
So did I.

807
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,205
You know what?

808
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:23,290
Let's go home and talk, okay?

809
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:26,877
You know, catch up on stuff.
And you know something?

810
01:00:27,503 --> 01:00:28,795
I'm hungry.

811
01:00:31,173 --> 01:00:34,426
Boy, your mom is going to be jazzed
we fixed that sink.

812
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:38,180
Snow peas.
You should like these.

813
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,140
Level with me. How is she?

814
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:41,225
She's good.

815
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:44,311
She moved a picture
of you next to her bed.

816
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:55,322
What's that?

817
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:56,573
Mom's home.

818
01:00:56,823 --> 01:00:58,784
She can't be!
She can't see me like this!

819
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:01,495
Nobody can see me like this,
but especially her.

820
01:01:13,966 --> 01:01:15,092
Just a minute, Mom!

821
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:18,345
Honey, why are all the windows open?

822
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:20,013
Please, you gotta help me.

823
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:21,932
It's freezing in here.

824
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:29,565
Charlie, what's going on?

825
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:31,483
Science fair project.

826
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:33,068
You're kidding.

827
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:35,237
Why is the floor wet?

828
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:37,531
Well, the science fair project...

829
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,534
...it's about what it's like
to live in an igloo.

830
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:44,454
And Eskimos have
wet floors, Mom. Duh.

831
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:52,963
It's freezing in here.
What's going on?

832
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:55,299
And what's with all the food?

833
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:56,633
I got kind of hungry.

834
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:58,802
Three bags of veggies?

835
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:00,429
I got real hungry?

836
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:03,140
What?

837
01:02:05,851 --> 01:02:08,187
There's something I need to tell you.

838
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:09,271
Well?

839
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:10,814
This science fair thing?

840
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:12,733
It was Natalie's idea.

841
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:16,820
Okay. Just tell Natalie
the next experiment's at her house.

842
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:20,574
Grab some towels and help me
with this, okay?

843
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:42,346
I think I need a day off.

844
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:08,830
Frosty the Snowman

845
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:12,292
Had to hurry on his way

846
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:14,586
But he waved goodbye

847
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:18,006
Saying, "Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some..."

848
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:22,719
You said the snowman spoke to you?

849
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,346
Yes, he did.

850
01:03:26,682 --> 01:03:27,766
And he knew my name.

851
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:30,477
Were there any other witnesses?

852
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:34,064
There wasn't any other witnesses.

853
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:38,277
In the Rocky Mountain states...

854
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:41,905
...folks may not be in for
a white Christmas after all.

855
01:03:42,865 --> 01:03:45,409
Charlie, honey,
did you fix the sink?

856
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:50,539
Why is the snowman facing this way?

857
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:53,375
I turned him...

858
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:56,170
...to even out his tan.

859
01:04:00,257 --> 01:04:03,260
Was that Sid I heard talking on TV?

860
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:05,846
What was he talking about?

861
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:08,015
Nothing, really.

862
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,435
I saw him yesterday at the bank...

863
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:14,521
...and he told me
that you quit the team.

864
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:16,857
Charlie, you didn't tell me.

865
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:20,235
You want to talk?

866
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,320
About what?

867
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:23,947
I don't know.

868
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:25,949
This hockey thing...

869
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:28,076
...or how you're doing in school.

870
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:30,037
You tell me.

871
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:32,915
I'm trying to watch the weather.

872
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:57,564
Gabby, it'll be all right.
I'm here now.

873
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,608
Well...

874
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,109
...sort of.

875
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:03,654
Oh, boy.

876
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:29,263
I invented the backdoor escape,
okay? What's up?

877
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:34,309
Since you showed up, Mom thinks
I'm nuts, Rory Buck wants to kill me...

878
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,603
...and I'm pretty sure
my dad's a snowman.

879
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:38,522
So what's the problem?

880
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:42,276
I know yesterday was a rough day.
Things'll get better.

881
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:47,990
Quit following me.

882
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,491
You're a snowman!

883
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:52,703
People will see you and cut you up
into ice cube trays.

884
01:05:52,953 --> 01:05:56,456
If that's the danger of hanging out
with you, I'll take the chance.

885
01:05:56,707 --> 01:05:57,624
- Fine.
- Fine.

886
01:06:02,254 --> 01:06:03,630
Really fine.

887
01:06:04,715 --> 01:06:06,300
Fine as wine...

888
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:07,968
What?

889
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:12,055
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

890
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:13,807
I think we look kind of...

891
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,726
...you know, cute.

892
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:17,477
Somebody's going to hear you.

893
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,064
Check it out.

894
01:06:22,524 --> 01:06:23,734
What's up with that?

895
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:27,988
Dude, he ditched us for a snowman.

896
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,122
I saw on the Geology Channel...

897
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:41,043
...they can actually turn pine cones
into a homemade explosive device.

898
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:47,257
How's your science
project coming?

899
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:49,510
What science project?

900
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,305
- The one about what it's like...
- Isn't that Charlie?

901
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:10,322
Hey, Mac.

902
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:12,908
Finally come in for
some Christmas lights?

903
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:15,702
I need a cup of that house paint
you call coffee.

904
01:07:15,953 --> 01:07:17,621
You got it.

905
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:19,873
So what's going on?

906
01:07:20,374 --> 01:07:25,170
Know when I promised not to bother
you for any talks with Charlie?

907
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:28,757
I lied.
I need you to talk to Charlie.

908
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:37,641
Nobody knows about this place.
I come here to think.

909
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:41,395
Well, it's really cool.

910
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:47,401
I've been here a lot this year.

911
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:53,240
You know, Dad, I'm sorry
I gave you back the harmonica.

912
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:56,910
Don't worry about it.
You were mad. I'd be mad too.

913
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:01,874
Can I ask you why you
quit playing hockey?

914
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:05,627
- Hockey's not that great.
- Yeah, right.

915
01:08:05,919 --> 01:08:09,673
The last person you see every night
is Wayne Gretzky on your wall.

916
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:14,678
Tell you what. We're here.
Let's work on the J-shot.

917
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:16,013
I don't think so.

918
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:19,725
I see. It's like that.

919
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:24,813
Looks like I'm working
out by myself...

920
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:27,316
...even though I haven't
played hockey in...

921
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:29,151
...a year.

922
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:33,530
I'll find a rock to use as a puck,
seeing as I'll be playing...

923
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,574
...all alone.

924
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:38,202
All right, all right, I'll skate.

925
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:40,495
Just stop bellyaching.

926
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:45,000
We'll get our nice balance.
We'll get set up.

927
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,586
Man, this was a lot easier
when I had legs.

928
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:50,797
We're going to stay nice and relaxed.
Real loose.

929
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:52,674
We come through. We snap our wrist.

930
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:54,134
Just before we do that...

931
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:56,386
...I make this little move here.

932
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:00,807
That goalie could sue me
for whiplash.

933
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:02,643
That's pretty cool.

934
01:09:02,893 --> 01:09:04,603
A little thing I call the J-shot.

935
01:09:05,312 --> 01:09:07,481
Now, let's play some hockey.

936
01:09:09,107 --> 01:09:10,776
Are you looking for the power?

937
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,236
Then bring it, son.

938
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:16,156
That's a J-shot, dude!

939
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:19,368
- I did it!
- That's you! That's all you!

940
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,869
But I didn't score.

941
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:22,704
Life is full of setbacks.

942
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:25,457
Look at me.
I'm a snowdrift with arms.

943
01:09:26,124 --> 01:09:29,670
You can give up, or you can
keep firing the puck, bud.

944
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,129
What do you think?

945
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:34,091
All right, give me the puck.

946
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:39,513
There's a lot of wood!

947
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:41,306
Fakes left, fakes right.

948
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:45,143
Man, nice shot. All right!

949
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:55,404
You got the...

950
01:09:58,323 --> 01:09:59,575
All right!

951
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:02,703
- Dad, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

952
01:10:02,953 --> 01:10:04,580
I think you got the J-shot.

953
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:07,082
I think you got the J-shot down.

954
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:09,251
All right, come on.
Let's go home.

955
01:10:13,755 --> 01:10:14,882
Come on, come on.

956
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:18,260
You played great.

957
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:20,179
Thanks for teaching me the J-shot.

958
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:23,348
I want to see you use it.
You got to get back on the team.

959
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:26,018
- No, I don't think so.
- I do.

960
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:29,062
You're letting your friends
and yourself down.

961
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:31,148
- But wait a second...
- No "buts".

962
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:32,774
Let's talk about schoolwork.

963
01:10:33,025 --> 01:10:34,234
What about it?

964
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:37,571
I saw your report card.
You've got serious jamming to do.

965
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:40,866
What's this, a lecture?
Now you're giving me a lecture?

966
01:10:42,993 --> 01:10:45,370
See? It's kind of scary.

967
01:10:47,915 --> 01:10:49,958
Think how the snowman must feel.

968
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:52,169
And I'm worried about your mom.

969
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:55,005
- Why?
- Has she hung any Christmas lights?

970
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:57,466
Not a lot.

971
01:10:57,716 --> 01:10:59,134
Yeah, I know. Hardly any.

972
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:00,969
Why are you telling me this?

973
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:03,096
You've got responsibilities now.

974
01:11:03,347 --> 01:11:04,973
You'll just have to face them.

975
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:06,808
You got to watch out for Mom...

976
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:09,269
...and straighten things out
with your friends.

977
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:12,940
I'm only 1 2 years old.
I can't take all this!

978
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:18,570
I might have pushed it
a smidge too hard.

979
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:23,492
Hey, hon.

980
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:28,205
I'm heading to the Shiverfest.
You want to come along?

981
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:29,289
No, thanks.

982
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,292
Or if you'd rather,
you can come with me.

983
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:36,171
I'm going to go caroling with
Mrs. Wilkins and the neighbor ladies.

984
01:11:49,393 --> 01:11:52,563
They did a good job this year.
Do you like the tree?

985
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:56,733
Want a balloon or anything?

986
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:58,485
Or pretzels? They've got...

987
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:01,530
Wow! Check out these snowmen.

988
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:09,329
Finals of the father-son snowman
building contest begin in 5 minutes.

989
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:10,998
Five minutes.

990
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:14,001
Mom thinks I'm going nuts, doesn't she?

991
01:12:14,668 --> 01:12:16,712
No, no, no.

992
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:19,882
She's just a little concerned,
that's all.

993
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:24,678
So...

994
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:25,971
...what's going on?

995
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:30,684
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

996
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:47,367
Come on, let's check out the band.

997
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:57,669
Talk about a tough gig.
It's freezing out here.

998
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:01,673
Why don't you play music anymore?

999
01:13:04,426 --> 01:13:06,929
I kind of lost the groove.

1000
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:08,639
The groove?

1001
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:14,061
Playing with your dad, I never
thought about what music was.

1002
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:16,522
Music was life. It was...

1003
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,814
...just...

1004
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:19,608
...like breathing, really.

1005
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:20,984
So natural.

1006
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:22,277
After he died...

1007
01:13:22,903 --> 01:13:24,404
...music became...

1008
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:26,114
...a job.

1009
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:29,076
You know, Jack always said to me:

1010
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,954
"It should never feel like work".

1011
01:13:33,038 --> 01:13:34,623
He was your best friend, huh?

1012
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:40,379
Your dad was the real deal.

1013
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:44,049
Do you think he wanted me
to be a musician?

1014
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:50,430
More than anything, he wanted you to be
whatever you wanted to be.

1015
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:52,891
He didn't care what that was.

1016
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:55,185
Just whatever made you happy.

1017
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:56,353
Really?

1018
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:57,980
Really.

1019
01:13:59,231 --> 01:14:00,899
Think you'll get the groove back?

1020
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:04,611
Someday, maybe.

1021
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:06,196
I hope so.

1022
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:43,317
Man, you got your shopping done, folks?

1023
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:45,611
You got 10 hours till Christmas Eve...

1024
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:48,030
...and it's already 55 degrees.

1025
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,990
Could get up to 70 today.

1026
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,534
Snowplow drivers got a day off.

1027
01:14:52,951 --> 01:14:54,661
It's hot enough to melt a snowman.

1028
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:57,331
Although, you know,
good news for Sid Gronic.

1029
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:00,626
Speaking of hot,
here's a little Billy Idol for you.

1030
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:04,254
"Hot in the City"
on central Colorado's classic rock.

1031
01:15:12,137 --> 01:15:14,306
Hey, man. Good morning.

1032
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:18,101
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what you said.

1033
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:19,269
You're right.

1034
01:15:21,313 --> 01:15:24,107
The J-shot,
it wasn't just about hockey, was it?

1035
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:25,734
What do you think?

1036
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,074
There's something I got to do.

1037
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,996
Hey, guys.

1038
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:39,414
Hey, Coach.

1039
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:46,672
I'd like to get back on the team.

1040
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:48,173
What?

1041
01:15:48,423 --> 01:15:50,467
You ditched us, Charlie.
Remember?

1042
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:54,429
Do we have to bring
your snowman buddy along too?

1043
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,015
There'll be no mention of snowmen
in this car.

1044
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:00,811
I don't know, Charlie.

1045
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:02,521
Well, I do.

1046
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:06,400
I say we let him back on the team.

1047
01:16:07,651 --> 01:16:10,195
Everybody deserves a second chance.

1048
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:15,284
Go get your stuff.

1049
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,123
Go, Charlie!

1050
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:34,803
They let me back on the team.

1051
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:40,434
Listen, Dad, about last night, I...

1052
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:44,146
It's okay, buddy.
What time they drop the puck?

1053
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:47,941
- 1 1 :30. But you don't got to come.
- I know that.

1054
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,988
He's talking to the snowman again.

1055
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,364
What'd I say, Tuck?

1056
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:57,993
Shake it, Charlie!

1057
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:01,914
Remember...

1058
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:03,123
...arms and wrists.

1059
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:04,833
Straight but relaxed.

1060
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:09,671
Thanks again, Dad.
See you after the game.

1061
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:33,570
Man, this sun is brutal.

1062
01:17:33,946 --> 01:17:36,990
I mean, I am literally
melting my ass off.

1063
01:17:37,616 --> 01:17:39,660
I didn't come
all the way from the hereafter...

1064
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:42,246
...to miss another one
of my kid's hockey games.

1065
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:44,039
Chet, listen.

1066
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:46,750
Chet, I know
we've had our differences...

1067
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,335
...but I got a game to catch.

1068
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,295
I really could use your help.

1069
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:54,132
So how are we going to do this?

1070
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:04,768
Go. Yes, Frost!

1071
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:13,527
He's good.

1072
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:15,988
Come on, okay. Here we go.
Come on.

1073
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:18,532
Maybe you got some friends
who are Huskies.

1074
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:20,659
You know a Saint Bernard?

1075
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:30,085
Score! One-nothing.

1076
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:31,962
And here we go again.

1077
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:35,090
That's right, Chet.
Take your time.

1078
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,218
Wonder if there's gonna be any
cute poodles there.

1079
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:40,429
That's what I thought!

1080
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,059
Good pass, Charlie!

1081
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:48,812
Go, Spencer! Go!

1082
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:52,691
He scored!

1083
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:56,403
Score by Spencer Jordan,
with an assist by Charlie Frost.

1084
01:18:56,653 --> 01:18:59,364
Mountaineers, one.
Devils, one.

1085
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:02,492
Okay, so far, so good.

1086
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:05,913
Stay cool.

1087
01:19:06,163 --> 01:19:07,664
Almost there.

1088
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:19,218
All right, Frost!

1089
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:20,636
Get it back!

1090
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:24,848
Go, Charlie. Go!

1091
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,808
Yes, Frost. Go!

1092
01:19:31,563 --> 01:19:33,815
One hundred yards
of piping-hot asphalt.

1093
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:35,484
Bad day to be a snowman.

1094
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:37,569
This could really sting.

1095
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:39,488
Okay, baby steps, baby steps.

1096
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:42,032
Man, this is getting hot.
This is hot.

1097
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:45,953
This is hot on my tootsies.
My tootsies is burning.

1098
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:47,829
Holy habanero!

1099
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,332
This is hot.
Let's speed her up!

1100
01:19:50,832 --> 01:19:52,626
Leaping Lawrence of Arabia!

1101
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:00,968
I am so hot!

1102
01:20:03,554 --> 01:20:05,597
All right, all right, Frost!

1103
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:08,851
All right, Charlie!

1104
01:20:09,101 --> 01:20:10,227
Turn it around!

1105
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:14,273
Frost, yes, go!

1106
01:20:23,031 --> 01:20:24,825
The J-shot, Charlie-boy, come on!

1107
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:27,661
Arms and wrists.

1108
01:20:28,328 --> 01:20:29,872
Straight but relaxed.

1109
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:49,766
Nice going, butthead!

1110
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,353
Outstanding! Yes!

1111
01:20:58,108 --> 01:20:59,151
My man! Yes!

1112
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:00,485
You got the power!

1113
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:03,906
Way to go, Charlie.

1114
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,993
The ice is now open
for all free skates.

1115
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:18,795
Outstanding game.
What can I say?

1116
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:20,088
You rock, dude.

1117
01:21:26,178 --> 01:21:29,139
You're melting.
You gotta be crazy to come here.

1118
01:21:29,389 --> 01:21:31,600
I couldn't miss your big game.

1119
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,603
Let's get you on the ice
so you can cool off.

1120
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:37,648
That's not going to work.

1121
01:21:38,482 --> 01:21:41,652
I got to get you someplace cold.
I won't lose you again.

1122
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:44,363
I'll be back!

1123
01:21:58,502 --> 01:22:00,337
Someplace cold.

1124
01:22:05,926 --> 01:22:07,261
Mom?

1125
01:22:09,012 --> 01:22:09,972
No cutting!

1126
01:22:10,222 --> 01:22:11,807
It's okay, ma'am.
He's my son.

1127
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:14,268
You need to drive us somewhere
right now.

1128
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:16,728
- Honey, I'm working.
- You've got to!

1129
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:17,771
What's wrong?

1130
01:22:18,063 --> 01:22:19,523
- He's melting.
- Who's melting?

1131
01:22:19,731 --> 01:22:20,899
The snowman's melting.

1132
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:22,442
That's just the way it is.

1133
01:22:22,693 --> 01:22:25,237
If you drive us to the mountains,
he won't melt.

1134
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:27,781
I'm not driving you
and your snowman anywhere.

1135
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,242
I know this has been hard for you.

1136
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:32,160
You don't understand, Mom.

1137
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:35,247
Dad's the snowman.

1138
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,374
What?

1139
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:40,335
I'm sorry, but he made me promise
not to tell you.

1140
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:44,047
Honey, he died a year ago.

1141
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:45,966
You'll just have to accept that.

1142
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:48,218
No, Mom, you don't understand.

1143
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:09,114
It's gonna be okay, Dad.

1144
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,138
Do me a favor.
Watch out for snowplows.

1145
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:39,228
Charlie's run away with the snowman.

1146
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:41,104
Really.

1147
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:43,315
Oh, my!

1148
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:50,155
Look out! Move, move!

1149
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:52,908
Excuse me. Look out.

1150
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:58,705
- He could be anywhere.
- Mac, it's a kid and a snowman.

1151
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:25,190
You and me.
Once and for all.

1152
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,443
I'll fight you any other time.
Just not now.

1153
01:24:28,694 --> 01:24:32,406
I don't know who's more stupider,
you or your snowman.

1154
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:35,951
Excuse me.
Did you just say "stupider"?

1155
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:38,245
What kind of word is "stupider"?

1156
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:42,207
Who said that?

1157
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,750
I did...

1158
01:24:44,001 --> 01:24:46,378
...you little baggy-pants snow punk.

1159
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:51,341
What the heck is it?

1160
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:53,302
Not what. Who.

1161
01:24:54,511 --> 01:24:55,846
And he's my dad.

1162
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:00,100
I knew it!

1163
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:04,104
Mitch and Pudge thought I was crazy.
But I saw you that day.

1164
01:25:04,646 --> 01:25:05,981
You throw a mean snowball.

1165
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:08,525
Okay, okay, okay.
Just chill, kid.

1166
01:25:08,775 --> 01:25:10,027
Don't have a meltdown.

1167
01:25:18,118 --> 01:25:20,495
Look, Rory,
it's too hot down here.

1168
01:25:20,746 --> 01:25:24,082
If I don't get him up to
the mountains, I'll lose him.

1169
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:25,667
He does look pretty bad.

1170
01:25:26,043 --> 01:25:27,169
Come on.

1171
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:30,047
You know what it's like
not to have a dad.

1172
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:32,341
It sucks.

1173
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:34,009
It sucks big time.

1174
01:25:36,762 --> 01:25:38,013
All right.

1175
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,307
Snowdad's better than no dad.

1176
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:41,642
Let's go.

1177
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:44,728
Come on.

1178
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:53,737
Come on, let's go!

1179
01:25:56,031 --> 01:25:58,492
That was good.
Merry Christmas.

1180
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:01,245
Come on.

1181
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,549
- Good Luck, Charlie!
- Thanks!

1182
01:26:48,584 --> 01:26:50,669
Okay, what's the snowman look like?

1183
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:54,214
Like a snowman.
He looks like a snowman.

1184
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,925
Three balls, two stick arms,
a cute cork nose.

1185
01:26:57,176 --> 01:26:58,844
What do you think he looks like?

1186
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:02,431
I'm trying to do my job, that's all.
Can you help me?

1187
01:27:04,516 --> 01:27:05,434
Five-eight.

1188
01:27:07,936 --> 01:27:08,770
White.

1189
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:10,230
Caucasian.

1190
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:13,775
Stocky. He's sort of well-built.

1191
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:17,738
I'd say 500, 550 pounds.

1192
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:20,365
Could you estimate an age?

1193
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:31,752
We're here!

1194
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:34,630
Ready? On three.

1195
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:36,006
I'm with you, buddy.

1196
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:38,800
One...

1197
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:42,054
...two...

1198
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:44,223
...three!

1199
01:27:58,779 --> 01:28:01,323
Fresh powder. My favorite!

1200
01:28:10,624 --> 01:28:12,000
My balls are freezing.

1201
01:28:13,043 --> 01:28:15,546
I never thought I'd say that
with a smile.

1202
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:18,006
Come on, Dad, let's go.

1203
01:28:28,517 --> 01:28:30,686
Let's go get you warmed up, buddy.

1204
01:28:42,656 --> 01:28:46,410
I was so busy trying to make my mark
on the world, I didn't...

1205
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:50,914
You are my mark on the world.

1206
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:11,393
Did you find him?

1207
01:29:11,643 --> 01:29:13,729
Charlie's sleeping.

1208
01:29:15,272 --> 01:29:16,523
He had one heck of a day.

1209
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:19,693
Who is this?

1210
01:29:20,736 --> 01:29:22,696
Where's Charlie?

1211
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:25,240
He's right here at the cabin.

1212
01:29:25,949 --> 01:29:27,618
Why don't you come get him?

1213
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:31,997
Jack?

1214
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:12,162
It's Christmas!

1215
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:16,625
Merry Christmas, Dad.

1216
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:18,460
Merry Christmas to you, bud.

1217
01:30:18,669 --> 01:30:19,503
You know what?

1218
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:23,423
I think this is
the best Christmas I ever had.

1219
01:30:23,799 --> 01:30:28,178
You know that night you came back?
It was because of your harmonica.

1220
01:30:28,512 --> 01:30:29,346
I wished it.

1221
01:30:30,138 --> 01:30:32,349
I wished you would be here
for Christmas.

1222
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:35,769
Thanks for giving me a second chance
to be your dad.

1223
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:39,064
Now, there's something
I have to tell you.

1224
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:41,149
It's time for me to go.

1225
01:30:42,526 --> 01:30:43,735
What?

1226
01:30:43,986 --> 01:30:46,280
No. I'm not going to let you.

1227
01:30:46,697 --> 01:30:48,907
You've got to get on with your life.

1228
01:30:49,533 --> 01:30:51,034
No, come on.

1229
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:53,328
It'll get cold again, Dad.
You'll see.

1230
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:55,330
Winter's just barely started.

1231
01:30:55,581 --> 01:30:56,707
And when it gets warm?

1232
01:30:57,624 --> 01:30:59,168
We'll go to South America.

1233
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:02,004
Summer here is winter there.

1234
01:31:02,337 --> 01:31:04,339
What about Mom?
Mom needs you.

1235
01:31:05,174 --> 01:31:07,050
What if I need you?

1236
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:10,679
I will always be there.
I promise.

1237
01:31:11,263 --> 01:31:13,473
As long as you hold someone
in your heart...

1238
01:31:13,724 --> 01:31:16,226
...you can never lose them.
Ever.

1239
01:31:16,685 --> 01:31:20,189
You let me back into your heart,
and that took real courage.

1240
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:23,817
You did it. And if you can
do that, you can do anything.

1241
01:31:24,776 --> 01:31:26,236
I'm so proud of you.

1242
01:31:26,695 --> 01:31:28,822
If you ever need me,
I'll be right here.

1243
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:31,867
You just call me.

1244
01:31:32,534 --> 01:31:33,869
Here.

1245
01:31:56,141 --> 01:31:57,226
I love you, Dad.

1246
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:00,395
I love you, Charlie.

1247
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:05,901
You're gonna be a good man.

1248
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,495
Okay now, let me go.

1249
01:32:28,632 --> 01:32:30,217
Oh, honey!

1250
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:34,096
- I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
- It's okay.

1251
01:33:04,585 --> 01:33:06,461
Oh, my God!

1252
01:33:14,136 --> 01:33:15,345
You look so...

1253
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:18,473
You look so great.

1254
01:33:22,853 --> 01:33:25,063
Sing me a smile, Jack.

1255
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:28,358
Every time

1256
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:32,863
We say goodbye I cry a little

1257
01:33:41,496 --> 01:33:43,040
I love you so much, Gab.

1258
01:33:43,373 --> 01:33:45,584
I love you too, Jack.

1259
01:33:50,797 --> 01:33:51,924
Goodbye.

1260
01:33:53,342 --> 01:33:55,219
Goodbye, Jack.

1261
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,515
Charlie-boy...

1262
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:05,229
...we had us a time, didn't we?

1263
01:34:06,355 --> 01:34:07,523
Yeah, we did.

1264
01:34:11,443 --> 01:34:12,528
Love you.

1265
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:14,696
Bye, Dad.

1266
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:16,698
Goodbye.

1267
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,743
Bye.

1268
01:34:35,717 --> 01:34:37,553
I will always hear you.

1269
