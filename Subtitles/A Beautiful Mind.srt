2
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,400
Mathematicians won the war.

3
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,190
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes...

4
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
...and built the A-bomb.

5
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,410
Mathematicians, like you.

6
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,410
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global Communism.

7
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,960
In medicine or economics...

8
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
...in technology or space...

9
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,460
...battle lines are being drawn.

10
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,800
To triumph, we need results...

11
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,010
...publishable, applicable results.

12
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,970
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,270
The next Einstein?

14
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,600
Who among you will be
the vanguard of democracy...

15
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,810
...freedom, and discovery?

16
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,650
Today, we bequeath America's future
into your able hands.

17
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,610
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

18
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,630
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,680
No, he wants it all for himself.

20
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,350
It's the first time the Carnegie Prize
has been split. Hansen's all bent.

21
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,770
He has his sights set on
Wheeler Lab, MIT's military think-tank.

22
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,150
They're only taking one this year.

23
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,110
Hansen's used to being picked first.

24
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,860
Yeah, he's wasted on math.

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,150
He should be running for president.

26
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,870
There could be a mathematical
explanation for how bad your tie is.

27
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,840
Thank you.

28
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,970
Neilson, symbol cryptography.

29
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,100
Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.

30
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,180
At least that's what he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?

31
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,440
The name's Bender. Atomic physics.

32
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,560
- And you are?
- Am I late?

33
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,570
- Yes, Mr. Sol.
- Oh, good. Hi.

34
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,110
- Sol. Richard Sol.
- The burden of genius.

35
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,570
- There he is.
- So many supplicants, and so little time.

36
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,280
- Mr. Sol.
- How are you, sir?

37
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,080
- Bender.
- Nice to see you.

38
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,910
- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
- Thank you.

39
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,750
I'll take another.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,120
Excuse me?

41
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,460
Pardon me. I assumed you were the waiter.

42
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,210
- Play nice.
- Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.

43
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,630
Honest mistake.

44
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,670
Well, Martin Hansen.

45
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,550
It is Martin, isn't it?

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,720
Why, yes, John, it is.

47
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,310
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

48
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,940
I've read your preprints...

49
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,440
...both of them.

50
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,190
The one on Nazi ciphers...

51
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,740
...and the other one
on nonlinear equations...

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,660
...and I am supremely confident
that there is not a single seminal...

53
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,410
...or innovative idea
in either one of them.

54
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,120
Enjoy your punch.

55
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,090
Gentlemen, meet John Nash...

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,090
...the mysterious West Virginia genius.

57
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,180
The other winner
of the distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

58
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,890
- Okay.
- Yeah?

59
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,260
Of course.

60
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,460
Oh, Christ.

61
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,260
The prodigal roommate arrives.

62
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,930
Roommate?

63
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,350
Oh, God, no.

64
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,770
Did you know that having a hangover...

65
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,690
...is not having enough water
in your body...

66
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,730
...to run your Krebs cycle?

67
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,110
Which is exactly what happens to you
when you're dying of thirst.

68
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,320
So, dying of thirst...

69
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,490
...would probably feel...

70
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,330
...pretty much like the hangover
that finally bloody kills you.

71
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,840
John Nash?

72
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,550
Hello.

73
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,260
Charles Herman.

74
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,130
Pleased to meet you.

75
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,850
All right! Well done!

76
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,150
Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.

77
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,450
Officer, I saw the driver who hit me.
His name was Johnny Walker.

78
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,540
Whew.

79
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,960
Well, I got in last night
in time for...

80
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,330
...English department cocktails.

81
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,880
Cock was mine...

82
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,380
...the tail belonged to a particularly
lovely young thing with a passion for...

83
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,220
...D.H. Lawrence.
You're not easily distracted, are you?

84
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,970
- I'm here to work.
- Are you? Right.

85
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,850
I see. Crikey!

86
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,900
Is my roommate a dick?

87
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,570
Hmm?

88
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,530
Listen.

89
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,660
If we can't break the ice...

90
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,540
...how about we drown it?

91
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,470
So what's your story?

92
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,760
You the poor kid that never got to go
to Exeter or Andover?

93
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,430
Despite my privileged upbringing,
I'm well-balanced.

94
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,230
I have a chip on both shoulders.

95
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,030
Maybe you're just better with the old
integers than you are with people.

96
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,860
My first grade teacher said
I was born with two helpings of brain...

97
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,990
...but only half a helping of heart.

98
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,530
Wow! She sounds lovely!

99
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,370
The truth is that I...

100
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,370
I don't like people much.

101
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,830
And they don't much like me.

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,880
But why,
with all your obvious wit and charm?

103
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,170
Seriously, John.

104
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,430
Mathematics...

105
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,720
Mathematics is never going to lead you
to a higher truth.

106
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,520
And you know why?

107
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,600
Because it's boring. It's really boring.

108
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,860
You know, half these schoolboys
are already published?

109
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,400
I cannot waste time
with these classes and...

110
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,280
...these books.

111
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,660
Memorizing the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals!

112
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,460
I need to look through...

113
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,960
...to the governing dynamics.

114
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,800
Find a truly original idea.

115
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,640
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

116
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,430
- It's the only way that I'll ever...
- Matter.

117
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,930
Yes.

118
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,650
- All right, who's next?
- I've played enough go for today.

119
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,480
- Come on.
- I hate this game.

120
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,230
Cowards, all of you!

121
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,490
None of you rise to meet my challenge?

122
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,120
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,
Sol does his laundry all semester.

123
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
- Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
- Not at all.

124
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,370
- Look at him.
- Nash!

125
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,290
Taking a reverse constitutional?

126
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,840
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm
to define their movement.

127
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,170
Oh.

128
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,880
Psycho.

129
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,510
I thought you dropped out.
You ever going to go to class or...

130
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,890
Classes will dull your mind.

131
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,140
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

132
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,900
Oh, I didn't know that.

133
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,320
Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.

134
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,740
Which is another way of saying
he doesn't have the nerve to compete.

135
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,530
You scared?

136
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,240
Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.

137
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,990
Stupefied by you.

138
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,620
No starch.

139
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,710
Pressed and folded.

140
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,670
Let me ask you something, John.

141
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,340
Be my guest, Martin.

142
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,510
Bender and Sol here correctly completed
Allen's proof of Peron’s conjectures.

143
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,260
Adequate work...

144
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,720
...without innovation.

145
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,520
- I'm flattered. You flattered?
- Flattered.

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,850
And I've got two weapons briefs
under security review by the DOD.

147
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,900
Derivative drivel.

148
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,280
But Nash achievements: zero.

149
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,490
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual question coming?

150
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,080
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

151
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,120
How will it feel
when I'm chosen for Wheeler...

152
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,380
...and you're not?

153
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,380
What if you lose?

154
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,020
You should not have won.

155
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,850
Hmm.

156
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,980
I had the first move,
my play was perfect.

157
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,780
The hubris of the defeated.

158
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,440
The game is flawed.

159
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,000
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

160
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,960
You've been in here for two days.

161
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,430
You know Hansen
has just published another paper?

162
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,100
I can't even find a topic for my doctorate.

163
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,770
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

164
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,650
This is a group playing touch football.

165
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,400
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over breadcrumbs.

166
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,360
And this is a woman who is chasing a man
who stole her purse.

167
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
John, you watched a mugging.

168
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,910
That's weird.

169
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,660
In competitive behavior,
someone always loses.

170
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,290
Well, my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.

171
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,880
See, if I could derive an equilibrium...

172
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,340
...where prevalence is
a non-singular event...

173
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,590
...where nobody loses.

174
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,140
Imagine the effect that would have
on conflict scenarios...

175
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,220
When did you last eat?

176
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,890
- When did you last eat?
- Currency exchange?

177
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,730
You know, food.

178
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,940
You have no respect for
cognitive reverie, you know?

179
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,400
Yes. But pizza...

180
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,700
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

181
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,580
And, of course, beer.

182
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,250
I have respect for beer.

183
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,670
I have respect for beer!

184
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,060
- Good evening, Neils.
- Hey, Nash.

185
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,980
Who's winning? You or you?

186
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,600
- Good evening, Nash.
- Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.

187
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,690
He's looking at you for sure.

188
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,740
Hey, Nash.

189
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,240
Neils is trying to get your attention.

190
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,290
- You're joking.
- Oh, no.

191
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,710
- Go with God.
- Come back a man.

192
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,920
- Fortune favors the brave.
- Bombs away.

193
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,930
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success...

194
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,220
...dramatically improve
with each attempt?

195
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,320
This is going to be classic.

196
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,020
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

197
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,440
I don't know what I'm required to say...

198
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,110
...in order for you
to have intercourse with me...

199
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,820
...but could we assume
that I've said all that?

200
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,070
Essentially we're talking about
fluid exchange, right?

201
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,370
So, could we just go
straight to the sex?

202
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,830
Oh, that was sweet.

203
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,830
Have a nice night, asshole!

204
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,040
Ladies, wait!

205
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,880
I especially liked the bit
about fluid exchange. It was...

206
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,300
...really charming.

207
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,100
Walk with me, John.

208
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,690
I've been meaning to talk with you.

209
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,480
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

210
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,400
We're deciding
which placement applications to support.

211
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,860
Wheeler, sir.
That would be my first choice.

212
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,700
Actually, I don't really have
a second choice, sir.

213
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,990
Your fellows have attended classes.
They've written papers.
They've published.

214
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,950
I'm still searching, sir, for my...

215
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,370
- Your original idea.
- Governing dynamics, sir.

216
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,460
It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid
it's just not nearly good enough.

217
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,390
- May I?
- Thank you.

218
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,430
I'm working on manifold embedding.

219
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,850
My bargaining stratagems
show some promise.

220
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,180
If you could just arrange another
meeting with Professor Einstein.

221
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,400
I've repeatedly asked you for that.

222
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,860
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...

223
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,270
John.

224
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,950
Do you see what they're doing there?

225
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,660
Congratulations, Professor Max.

226
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,370
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

227
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,000
It's the pens.

228
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,420
Reserved for a member of the department
that makes the achievement of a lifetime.

229
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,840
Now what do you see, John?

230
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,720
Recognition.

231
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,720
Well done, Professor.

232
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,220
Well, try seeing accomplishment.

233
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,100
Is there a difference?

234
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,940
You haven't focused.

235
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,360
I'm sorry, but up to this
point, your record doesn't
warrant any placement at all.

236
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,070
Good day.

237
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,340
And my compliments to you, sir.

238
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,210
Thank you so much.

239
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,270
I can't see it.

240
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,320
Jesus Christ, John.

241
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,990
I can't fail.

242
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,830
- This is all I am.
- Come on, let's go out.

243
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,870
- I have to get something done.
- John!

244
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,210
- I can't keep staring into space.
- John, enough!

245
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,550
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules, read their books...

246
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,720
...do their classes.

247
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,390
Come on! Go on, bust your head!
Kill yourself.

248
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,470
Don't do it. Don't mess around.

249
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,310
Bust your head! Go on,
bust that worthless head wide open.

250
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,560
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?

251
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,230
It's not my problem.

252
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,200
And it's not your problem.

253
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,240
It's their problem.

254
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,540
Your answer isn't, "face the wall."

255
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,790
It's out there...

256
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,290
...where you've been working.

257
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,900
That was heavy.

258
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,660
That Isaac Newton fellow was right.

259
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,820
- He was onto something.
- Clever boy.

260
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,580
Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.

261
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,040
Oh, God.

262
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,750
- Incoming, gentlemen.
- Ay-yi-yi.

263
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,800
Deep breaths.

264
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,680
Nash, you might want to stop
shuffling your papers for five seconds.

265
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,690
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.

266
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,320
We're not here for beer, my friend.

267
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
Oh.

268
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,240
Does anyone else feel
she should be moving in slow motion?

269
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,910
Will she want a large wedding, you think?

270
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,160
Shall we say swords? Pistols at dawn?

271
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,000
Have you remembered nothing?

272
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,920
Recall the lessons of Adam Smith...

273
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,250
...the father of modern economics.

274
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,880
"In competition...

275
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,840
"...individual ambition
serves the common good."

276
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,880
Every man for himself, gentlemen.

277
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,550
Those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

278
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,310
I'm not going to strike out.

279
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,470
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

280
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,980
Nobody move.

281
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,850
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

282
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,320
Oh, God. He may have the upper hand now...

283
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,440
...but wait until he opens his mouth.

284
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,450
Remember the last time?

285
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,780
That was one for the history books.

286
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,500
- Adam Smith needs revision.
- What are you talking about?

287
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,790
If we all go for the blonde...

288
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,340
...we block each other.

289
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,390
Not a single one of
us is going to get her.

290
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,180
So then we go for her friends...

291
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,650
...but they will all give
us the cold shoulder because
nobody likes to be second choice.

292
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,230
Well, what if no one goes for the blonde?

293
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,320
We don't get in each other's way...

294
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,910
...and we don't insult the other girls.

295
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
That's the only way we win.

296
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,410
That's the only way we all get laid.

297
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,710
Adam Smith said:

298
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
"The best result comes...

299
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,050
"...from everyone in the group
doing what's best for himself."

300
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,800
Right. Incomplete. Okay?

301
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,140
Because the best result will come...

302
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,440
...from everyone in the group...

303
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,730
...doing what's best for himself...

304
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,610
...and the group.

305
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,780
If this is some way for you
to get the blonde, go to hell.

306
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,280
Governing dynamics. Adam Smith...

307
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,530
...was wrong.

308
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,950
- Here we go.
- Careful, careful.

309
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,960
Thank you.

310
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,810
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

311
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,330
You do realize this flies in the face
of 150 years of economic theory?

312
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,540
Yes, I do, sir.

313
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,880
- That's rather presumptuous, no?
- It is, sir.

314
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,890
Well, Mr. Nash...

315
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,100
...with a breakthrough of this magnitude...

316
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,310
...I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.

317
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,900
Wheeler Labs...

318
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,610
...they'll ask you to recommend
two team members.

319
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,620
Stills and Frank are excellent choices.

320
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,580
Sol and Bender, sir.

321
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,250
Sol and Bender
are extraordinary mathematicians.

322
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,840
Has it occurred to you that Sol and
Bender might have plans of their own?

323
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,010
We made it!

324
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,050
Wheeler, we made it!

325
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,890
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

326
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,440
Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.

327
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,420
Umm...

328
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,840
Governing dynamics.

329
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,550
Congratulations, John.

330
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,680
- Toast! To Wheeler Labs!
- To Wheeler!

331
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,210
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

332
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,040
Dr. Nash, your coat?

333
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,500
Thank you, sir.

334
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,010
General, this is Wheeler team leader,
Dr. John Nash.

335
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,680
- Glad you could come, Doctor.
- Hello.

336
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,300
Right this way.

337
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,180
We've been intercepting
radio transmissions from Moscow.

338
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,560
The computer can't detect a pattern,
but I'm sure it's code.

339
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,020
Why is that, General?

340
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,070
Ever just know something, Dr. Nash?

341
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,780
Constantly.

342
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,370
We've developed several ciphers.

343
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,830
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data?

344
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,420
- Doctor?
- 6-7-3-7.

345
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,670
0- 3-6...

346
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,270
8- 4-9-4.

347
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,090
9- 1-4-0-3-4.

348
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,490
I need a map.

349
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,910
46-13-08, 67-46-90.

350
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,040
Starkey Corners, Maine.

351
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,090
48-03-01.

352
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,090
91-26-35.

353
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,010
Prairie Portage, Minnesota.

354
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,590
These are latitudes and longitudes.

355
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,600
There are at least 10 others.

356
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,310
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

357
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,980
Extraordinary.

358
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,820
Gentlemen, we need to move on this.

359
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:43,070
- Who's Big Brother?
- You've done your
country a great service.

360
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,240
- Captain!
- Yes, sir.

361
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,040
Accompany Dr. Nash.

362
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,540
What are the Russians moving, General?

363
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,790
Captain Rogers will escort you
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.

364
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,000
Thank you.

365
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,130
Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

366
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,100
None of those
who said they don't like the method...

367
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,230
...have told us any other method
they could use that would be effective.

368
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,440
- It's Dr. Nash.
- All right.

369
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,960
- Thank you, sir.
- Home run at the Pentagon?

370
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,500
Have they actually taken the word
"classified" out of the dictionary?

371
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,000
Hi. The air conditioning broke again.

372
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,260
How am I supposed to be in here
saving the world if I'm melting?

373
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,930
Our hearts go out to you.

374
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,510
Two trips to the Pentagon in four years.

375
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,180
- That's two more than we've had.
- It gets better.

376
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,940
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

377
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,730
You know, the Russians have the H-bomb,
the Nazis are repatriating South America...

378
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,900
...the Chinese have a standing army
of 2.8 million...

379
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,950
...and I am doing stress tests on a dam.

380
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,910
You made the cover of Fortune again.

381
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,870
Please note the use of the word "you,"
not "we."

382
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,000
That was supposed to be just me.

383
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,210
Not only do they rob me
of the Fields' Medal...

384
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,630
...they put me on the cover
of Fortune magazine with these hacks...

385
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,380
...these scholars of trivia.

386
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,350
Exactly what's the difference
between genius and most genius?

387
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,350
Quite a lot.

388
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,140
He's your son.
Anyway, you've got 10 minutes.

389
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,480
- I've always got 10 minutes.
- Before your new class?

390
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,700
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

391
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,320
You are a doctor, John, and no.

392
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,740
You know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities...

393
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,960
...MIT gets America's great
minds of today, teaching their
great minds of tomorrow.

394
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,340
- Poor bastards.
- Now, have a nice day at school.

395
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,000
The bell is ringing.

396
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,950
The eager young minds of tomorrow.

397
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,330
Can we leave one open,
Professor? It's really hot, sir.

398
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,090
Your comfort comes second
to my ability to hear my own voice.

399
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,890
Personally...

400
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,730
...I think this class will be
a waste of your...

401
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,810
...and what is infinitely worse...

402
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,610
...my time.

403
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,150
However, here we are.

404
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,160
So you may attend or not.

405
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,030
You may complete your assignments
at your whim.

406
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,450
We have begun.

407
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,460
Miss.

408
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,380
Excuse me!

409
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,380
- Excuse me!
- Hey, hey!

410
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,510
Hi!

411
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,090
We have a little problem.

412
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,970
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed...

413
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,430
....and extremely noisy with them open.

414
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,100
I was wondering
if there was any way you could...

415
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,730
...I don't know, maybe work
someplace else for about 45 minutes?

416
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,900
- Not a problem.
- Thank you so much!

417
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,900
- Break!
- Got it!

418
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,740
Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.

419
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,160
As you will find in multivariable
calculus, there is often...

420
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,920
...a number of solutions
for any given problem.

421
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,050
As I was saying, this problem here...

422
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,550
...will take some of you
many months to solve.

423
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,970
For others among you...

424
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,520
...it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

425
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,530
Professor Nash.

426
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,800
William Parcher.

427
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,920
Big Brother...

428
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,260
...at your service.

429
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,180
What can I do
for the Department of Defense?

430
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,680
- Are you here to give me a raise?
- Let's take a walk.

431
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,980
- Impressive work at the Pentagon.
- Yes, it was.

432
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,070
Oppenheimer used to say, "A genius
sees the answer before the question."

433
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,740
You knew Oppenheimer?

434
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,490
His project was under my supervision.

435
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,320
Which project?

436
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,330
- That project.
- It's not that simple.

437
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,120
Well, you ended the war.

438
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,750
We incinerated 150,000 people
in a heartbeat.

439
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,670
Great deeds come at great cost,
Mr. Parcher.

440
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,010
Conviction, it turns out, is a luxury
of those on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

441
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,310
I'll try and keep that in mind.

442
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,560
So, John, no family...

443
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,060
...no close friends.

444
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,320
- Why is that?
- I like to think it's
because I'm a Ione wolf.

445
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,160
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

446
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,080
There are certain endeavors...

447
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,160
...where your lack of personal connection
would be considered an advantage.

448
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,080
- This is a secure area.
- They know me.

449
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,510
Have you ever been here?

450
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,510
We were told in our initial
briefing these warehouses were abandoned.

451
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,760
That's not precisely accurate.

452
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,930
By telling you this...

453
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,390
...I am increasing your security
clearance to top secret.

454
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,140
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

455
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Get it?

456
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,940
What operation?

457
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,150
Those are a good idea.

458
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,040
This factory is in Berlin,
we seized it at the end of the war.

459
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,670
Nazi engineers were attempting to build
a portable atomic bomb.

460
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,590
The Soviets reached this facility before
we did, and we lost the damn thing.

461
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,340
The routing orders at the Pentagon.

462
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,640
They were about this, weren't they?

463
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,180
The Soviets aren't as unified
as people believe.

464
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,480
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svoboda...

465
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,150
...the "New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb...

466
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,860
...and intends to detonate
it on U.S. soil.

467
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,190
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

468
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,540
Man is capable of as
much atrocity as he has imagination.

469
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,750
New Freedom has sleeper agents
here in the U.S.

470
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,590
McCarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately,
that doesn't make him wrong.

471
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,550
New Freedom communicates
to its agents...

472
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,800
...through codes imbedded in newspapers
and magazines...

473
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,600
...and that's where you come in.

474
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,140
You see, John, what distinguishes you...

475
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,730
...is that you are, quite simply...

476
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,650
...the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

477
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,620
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

478
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,080
Commit this list of periodicals to memory.

479
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,260
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes, decipher them.

480
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,890
Place your chin on the chin rest.

481
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,390
- Stare into the light.
- Pulse 88, regular.

482
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,230
Okay, this may be a little uncomfortable.

483
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,940
It's got a little zap to it, doesn't it?

484
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,070
He just implanted a radium diode.

485
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,990
Don't worry, it's safe.

486
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,660
The isotope decays predictably.

487
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,120
As a result,
these numbers change over time.

488
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,250
They're the access codes
to your drop spot.

489
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,960
So what am I now, a spy?

490
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,560
Come.

491
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,230
Boy, you must be really important.

492
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,330
It's all right, Mike.

493
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,590
What are you working on?

494
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,970
Classified.

495
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,550
Everyone waited half an hour.

496
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,390
- For?
- Class.

497
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,890
You missed class today.

498
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,770
Oh. I suspect that...

499
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,610
...nobody missed me.

500
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,240
The problem that you left on the board...

501
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,030
...I solved it.

502
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,830
- No, you didn't.
- You didn't even look.

503
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,410
I never said that the vector fields
were rational functions.

504
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,550
Your solution is elegant.

505
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,380
Though on this particular occasion...

506
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,550
...ultimately incorrect.

507
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,250
- You're still here.
- I'm still here.

508
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,580
Why?

509
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,380
I'm wondering, Professor Nash...

510
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,170
...if I can ask you to dinner.

511
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,260
You do eat, don't you?

512
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,850
On occasion, yeah.

513
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,640
Table for one.
Prometheus alone chained to the rock...

514
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,440
...with the bird circling overhead,
you know how it is.

515
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,440
No, I expect that you wouldn't know...

516
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,620
Leave your address with my office.
I'll pick you up Friday...

517
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,740
...at 8:00 and we'll eat.

518
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,300
One more thing. Do you have a name, or
should I just keep calling you "miss"?

519
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,140
Governor...

520
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,760
- ...may I present...
- Miss Alicia Larde.

521
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,480
Professor, please. You and the governor.

522
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,940
Wait, one second. I'm sorry.

523
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,400
I want a copy of this.
First big date and all, you know.

524
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,740
So, you boys need to look good...

525
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,370
...which is not a state you find
yourselves in altogether naturally.

526
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,130
There. Better.

527
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,050
- I'm surprising him.
- You just keep on surprising him.

528
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,510
Professor.

529
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,570
God must be a painter.

530
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,990
Why else would we have so many colors?

531
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,530
So you're a painter?

532
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,370
That's not actually what I said...

533
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,460
...but, yes, I am.

534
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,100
Here.

535
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,560
Me.

536
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,140
Your date.

537
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,230
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

538
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,400
That's a plan.

539
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,950
Champagne would be lovely.

540
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,410
I'll be outside.

541
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,240
I will get the champagne.

542
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,170
Oh, thank you.

543
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,220
Thank you for that.

544
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,760
No, keep it.

545
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,430
I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.

546
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,720
- Do you?
- No.

547
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,850
I don't believe in luck.

548
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,860
But I do believe
in assigning value to things.

549
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,030
Oh.

550
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,500
I once tried to count them all.

551
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,170
I actually made it to 4,348.

552
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,090
You are exceptionally odd.

553
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,550
I bet you're very popular with the girls.

554
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,270
A pair of odd ducks, then.

555
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,270
Mmm.

556
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,480
Pick a shape.

557
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,740
What?

558
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,780
Pick a shape, an animal, anything.

559
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,910
Okay.

560
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,660
An umbrella.

561
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,500
Do it again.

562
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,540
Do it again.

563
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,210
- All right. What would you like?
- Do an octopus.

564
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,550
You don't talk much, do you?

565
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,220
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

566
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,930
I don't mean work.

567
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,730
I find that polishing my interactions...

568
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,400
...in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

569
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,820
I have a tendency
to expedite information flow...

570
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,450
...by being direct.

571
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,460
- I often don't get a pleasant result.
- Try me.

572
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,960
All right.

573
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,130
I find you attractive.

574
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:00,550
Your aggressive moves towards me
indicate that you feel the same way.

575
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,940
But still, ritual requires
that we continue with a
number of platonic activities...

576
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,020
...before we have sex.

577
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:11,230
I am proceeding with those activities...

578
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,690
...but in point of actual fact...

579
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,030
...all I really want to do is have
intercourse with you as soon as possible.

580
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,240
Are you going to slap me now?

581
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,690
How was that result?

582
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,580
What are you doing?

583
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,050
Trying to isolate patterned reoccurrences
within periodicals over time.

584
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,300
And you?

585
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,340
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

586
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,600
Do I know you?

587
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,390
My uncle says you're very smart
but not very nice...

588
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,310
...so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

589
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,360
And who might your uncle be?

590
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,150
The prodigal roommate...

591
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,280
...returns.

592
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,790
Come here, Charles.

593
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,000
My sister got herself
killed in a car crash.

594
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,380
Not too far now, Marcee!

595
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,720
Her cowboy husband was too drunk
to know that he was too drunk to drive.

596
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,850
So, I took her in.

597
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,060
- She's so small.
- She's young. That's how they come.

598
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,070
I'm at Harvard...

599
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,030
...doing the great author's workshop.

600
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,200
D.H. bloody Lawrence.

601
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,120
I really do think
you should buy yourself a new book.

602
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,910
Well, I've been reading a lot about you.

603
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,660
How are you, John?

604
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,330
At first, all my work here was trivial...

605
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,090
...but a new assignment came up and...

606
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,920
I can't really tell you any details.

607
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,300
Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?

608
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,390
Something like that.

609
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,390
- And...
- Yes?

610
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,730
Well, I met a girl.

611
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,730
- No! A human girl?
- Homo sapien.

612
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,610
- A biped?
- Yep. And contrary to all probabilities...

613
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:57,650
...she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.

614
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,150
God, that's wonderful.

615
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,700
There's no accounting for taste, is there?

616
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,830
- Should I marry her?
- Oh, God. Right.

617
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,340
I mean, everything's going well.
The job is fine. I have enough money.

618
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,090
It all seems to add up.

619
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,760
But how do you know for sure?

620
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,550
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

621
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,220
That's the only sure thing I do know.

622
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:36,320
Good evening.

623
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,080
Alicia, please don't be angry.
I just lost track of time at work...

624
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,290
- ... Again.
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm sorry.

626
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,710
I didn't have time to wrap it.

627
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,630
Happy birthday.

628
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:06,720
The refractive faces of the glass
create a full wavelength dispersal...

629
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,680
... so if you look inside, you can see...

630
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,520
- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.

631
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,690
Yeah.

632
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:16,770
Remember you said that time, God must
be a painter because of all the colors?

633
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,230
At the governor's house you said that.

634
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,900
I didn't think you were listening.

635
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,780
I was listening.

636
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,580
It's beautiful.

637
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:55,020
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?

638
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,270
Because I need some kind of proof,
some kind of verifiable, empirical data.

639
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:08,160
I'm sorry, just give me a moment...

640
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,120
...to redefine my girlish notions
of romance.

641
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,170
A proof?

642
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:19,380
Verifiable data.

643
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,260
Okay.

644
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,720
Well, how big is the universe?

645
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,100
Infinite.

646
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:30,600
How do you know?

647
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,060
- Because all the data indicates it.
- But it hasn't been proven yet?

648
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,850
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

649
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,940
I don't, I just believe it.

650
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,030
It's the same with love, I guess.

651
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,790
Now...

652
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,670
...the part that you don't know...

653
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,630
...is if I want to marry you.

654
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,030
Smile for the camera!

655
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,620
Well done!

656
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,450
Congratulations.

657
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,660
You look beautiful.

658
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,330
Hi, how are you?

659
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,180
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, now.

660
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,850
Be safe!

661
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,300
Get in. Hurry.

662
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,760
They're following us.

663
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,480
- Who is following us?
- The drop has been compromised.

664
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,730
Get down!

665
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,230
Stay down.

666
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:11,470
- Take this.
- I am not shooting anybody.

667
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:14,220
- Take the goddamn gun!
- No!

668
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:34,990
You stay back. Don't move.

669
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:22,920
John?

670
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,220
Hi.

671
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,970
Where were you?

672
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,190
- Sol...
- Yeah, I talked to Sol.

673
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:44,060
He said you left the office hours ago.

674
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,030
Why didn't you call me?

675
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,410
Are you all right?

676
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,710
Honey?

677
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,300
John...

678
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,680
...please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

679
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,840
John, open the door.

680
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,850
Come on, open the door! Let me in!

681
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,020
Talk to me!

682
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,480
John!

683
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:28,020
Open this door!

684
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,040
Watch for cars, kids.

685
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,250
John.

686
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:33,130
William.

687
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,050
This is not what I signed up for.

688
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,430
Every time a car backfires
or a door slams...

689
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,560
I understand better
than you could possibly imagine.

690
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,820
You need to calm down, John.

691
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,200
Now listen. We're closing in on the bomb...

692
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,490
...in large part due to your work.

693
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,700
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

694
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:05,210
William, my circumstance has changed.

695
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,460
Alicia's pregnant.

696
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,470
I told you attachments were dangerous.

697
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,100
You chose to marry the girl.

698
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,230
I did nothing to prevent it.

699
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,610
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...

700
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:32,190
...is for you to continue your work.

701
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,650
Well, I'll just quit.

702
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,280
You won't.

703
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:38,070
Why would I not?

704
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,370
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

705
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,830
You quit working for me...

706
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,210
...I quit working for you.

707
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:02,050
Parcher!

708
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:08,850
John, you all right?

709
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,290
John?

710
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,960
Turn it off! Turn off the light!

711
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,470
Why would you do that?

712
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:42,100
- Why would you turn the light on?
- What is wrong with you?

713
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,100
You have to go to your sister's.

714
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:48,230
I left the car out in back.
Take Commonwealth, no side streets.

715
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,600
Stay where it's crowded.

716
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,310
John, I'm not going anywhere!

717
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,900
When you get to your sister's,
wait for my call.

718
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,730
- Get your things.
- I'm not leaving!

719
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,490
Stop! Stop it!

720
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,660
Please, Alicia.

721
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:03,780
I'll explain when I can.

722
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:52,630
Uncle John!

723
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,210
Uncle John!

724
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,170
Hey, baby girl!

725
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,800
Wow, someone needed a hug!

726
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,970
I saw you on the slate,
and I thought to myself:

727
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:10,350
"How can I miss seeing a guest lecture
by the inimitable John Nash?"

728
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,610
What's wrong?

729
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:20,530
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

730
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:22,990
Now you tell me, what is it?

731
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,870
Professor Nash!

732
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,370
Welcome!

733
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:29,790
After?

734
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,970
So, we see that the zeroes
of the Riemann Zeta function...

735
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,800
...correspond to singularities...

736
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,310
...in space-time...

737
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,440
Singularities in space-time then...

738
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:57,190
And conventional number theory...

739
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:03,910
It breaks down
in the face of relativistic exploration.

740
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:23,220
Sometimes our expectations
are betrayed by the numbers.

741
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:29,770
Variables are impossible
to assign any rational value.

742
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:52,000
Professor Nash!

743
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,800
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?

744
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:11,770
Professor Nash,
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

745
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,100
What do you want?

746
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:16,520
My name is Rosen.

747
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,940
Dr. Rosen. I'm a psychiatrist.

748
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,690
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.

749
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,570
I'd like you to come with me, John.

750
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:27,570
Just for a chat.

751
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:31,330
It appears I have no choice.

752
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,220
Help me! Somebody!

753
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,930
Somebody!

754
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:52,640
Help me! Get off me!

755
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,730
I know who you are!

756
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,560
No, no, don't!

757
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,310
Charles, they're Russians!
They're Russians!

758
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,980
Call somebody! Call somebody!

759
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,110
- They're Russians!
- Steady the leg.

760
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:04,740
Get away from me.

761
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,030
Stay away from me!

762
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,450
There, now.

763
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,040
All better.

764
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:21,710
Everything's all right here.

765
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:25,470
Watch your head.

766
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:57,210
John?

767
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:01,210
Can you hear me?

768
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:16,850
Go easy now.

769
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,940
Thorazine takes a
little while to wear off.

770
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,030
Sorry about the restraints.

771
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,150
You've got one hell of a right hook.

772
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,530
Where am I?

773
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,450
MacArthur Psychiatric Hospital.

774
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:40,670
I find that highly unlikely.

775
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:43,170
You made a mistake.

776
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:46,670
My work is non-military in application.

777
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,430
Which work is that, John?

778
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,560
I don't know anything.

779
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:56,980
There's no good in keeping secrets,
you know.

780
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:13,830
Charles?

781
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,250
Charles?

782
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:21,960
I didn't mean to get you involved in this.

783
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,630
I'm sorry.

784
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,760
Charles?

785
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:41,850
The prodigal roommate revealed.

786
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,400
"Saw my name on the lecture slate"?

787
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,530
You lying son of a bitch!

788
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,160
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

789
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:54,780
How do you say
"Charles Herman" in Russian?

790
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,200
How do you say it in Russian?

791
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,330
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.

792
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,590
He's right there. He's right there.

793
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,300
Stop! I don't know anything!

794
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,130
Stop! I don't know anything!

795
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:12,800
My name is John Nash.

796
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:14,930
I'm being held against my will.

797
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,470
Somebody call the Department of Defense.

798
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,680
My name is John Nash.

799
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,730
I'm being held against my will!

800
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,490
What's wrong with him?

801
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,990
John has schizophrenia.

802
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:38,160
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

803
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,460
But his work.

804
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,880
He deals with conspiracy.

805
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,210
Yes, I know.

806
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:53,470
In John's world,
these behaviors are accepted...

807
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,800
...encouraged.

808
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,680
As such,
his illness may have gone untreated...

809
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,520
...far longer than is typical.

810
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,310
What do you mean? How long?

811
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,150
Possibly since graduate school.

812
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:08,400
At least that's when his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

813
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,900
What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?

814
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,200
One, so far, that I am aware of.

815
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,910
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

816
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,250
Charles isn't imaginary.

817
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,540
They have been best friends
since Princeton.

818
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:25,710
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

819
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:29,170
He's always in town
for so little time, lecturing.

820
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,880
- Was he at your wedding?
- He had to teach.

821
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,760
Have you seen a picture,
or talked to him on the phone?

822
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,100
This is ridiculous.

823
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,890
I phoned Princeton.

824
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,100
According to their housing records,
John lived alone.

825
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,770
Now, which is more likely?
That your husband...

826
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,280
...a mathematician
with no military training...

827
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,200
...is a spy fleeing the Russians...
- You're making him sound crazy.

828
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,200
Or, that he has lost his grip on reality?

829
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,370
The only way I can help him,
is to show him the difference...

830
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:07,960
...between what is real
and what is in his mind.

831
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:13,380
Come on.

832
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,510
What's he been working on?

833
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,850
His work is classified.

834
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,100
He mentioned a supervisor...

835
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,480
...by the name of William Parcher.

836
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:28,320
Maybe Mr. Parcher
can clarify things for us.

837
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:31,030
But I can't get to him without clearances.

838
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,990
You want me to help you get the details
of my husband's work?

839
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:39,740
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.

840
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,620
Is that what you think?

841
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,790
- What did the doctor say?
- Is he sick?

842
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,960
I don't know.

843
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:52,170
I want to see
what John's been working on.

844
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,130
- You can't go in his office.
- It's classified, Alicia.

845
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:56,430
Stop.

846
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,110
Oh, my God.

847
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,240
Oh, my God.

848
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:28,080
Why didn't you say something?

849
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:31,210
Alicia, John has always been...

850
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,460
...a little weird.

851
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,220
He said he was doing code-breaking.

852
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,300
- It was eyes-only.
- Top-secret, part of the military effort.

853
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,550
Was he?

854
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,600
It was possible.

855
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,810
Directives come down all the time
that some aren't cleared for.

856
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:50,520
- It was possible.
- Possible, but not likely.

857
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:57,660
Lately, he'd become much more agitated,
and then when you called...

858
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,490
So, is this all he's been doing every day?

859
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,450
Cutting up magazines?

860
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,080
Well, not all.

861
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,380
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

862
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,550
I missed you.

863
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:41,550
I have to talk to you.

864
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,510
Okay.

865
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:51,020
Alicia, I've been thinking about it...

866
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,400
...and I do realize that my behavior...

867
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:57,860
...and my inability
to discuss the situation with you...

868
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,450
...must have appeared insane.

869
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,820
I left you with no other choice.

870
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,240
I do understand...

871
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,290
- ...and I'm truly sorry.
- That's okay.

872
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,420
Everything will be all right.

873
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,040
Everything will be all right.

874
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:18,460
We just have to talk quietly.

875
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:23,090
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

876
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:26,100
I'll tell you everything now.

877
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:30,770
It's breaking with protocol,
but you need to know...

878
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,610
...because you have to help me
get out of here.

879
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:39,400
I've been doing top-secret work
for the government.

880
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:41,360
There's a threat that exists...

881
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,870
...of catastrophic proportions.

882
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:47,870
I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.

883
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:50,000
That's why they won't do away with me.

884
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:53,460
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me from doing my work.

885
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,080
You have to get to Wheeler.

886
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:58,170
- You have to find William Parcher.
- Stop.

887
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,420
Stop!

888
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:06,300
I went to Wheeler.

889
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,260
Good, good.

890
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:10,390
There is no William Parcher.

891
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,900
Of course there is.
I've been working for him.

892
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,690
Doing what? Breaking codes?

893
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:21,360
Dropping packages in a secret mailbox
for the government to pick up?

894
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,410
How could you know that?

895
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,950
Sol followed you.

896
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:30,830
- He thought it was harmless.
- Sol followed me?

897
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,510
They've never been opened.

898
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,430
It isn't real.

899
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,810
There is no conspiracy, John.

900
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,270
There is no William Parcher.

901
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:58,230
It's in your mind.

902
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:03,490
Do you understand, baby?

903
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,570
You're sick.

904
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,790
You're sick, John.

905
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:13,620
John?

906
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:16,250
John!

907
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:25,630
Code red.

908
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,510
Dr. Rosen, code red. Observation Room 2.

909
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:32,060
Dr. Rosen, code red. Observation Room 2.

910
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:44,650
John?

911
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,820
John?

912
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,500
The implant is gone.

913
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,920
I can't find it.

914
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,590
It's gone.

915
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:36,120
You see, the nightmare of schizophrenia...

916
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:38,670
...is not knowing what's true.

917
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,500
Imagine...

918
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,880
...if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places...

919
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:50,390
...and the moments most important to you
were not gone, not dead...

920
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:54,020
...but worse, had never been.

921
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:59,690
What kind of hell would that be?

922
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,740
Administering insulin.

923
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:10,240
8:42 a.m.

924
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,010
How often?

925
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:14,850
Five times a week for 10 weeks.

926
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:41,420
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

927
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:44,130
Hansen is running the department now.

928
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,050
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

929
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,550
Yeah.

930
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:53,350
John won't come near the campus, though.
I think he's ashamed.

931
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:57,430
Hey. Hey.

932
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,350
Want this?

933
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,560
So, Alicia, how are you holding up?

934
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:06,650
The delusions have passed.

935
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:10,860
They're saying with the medication
and low stress environment...

936
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,990
I mean, how are you?

937
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,080
I think often what I feel...

938
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:26,210
...is obligation.

939
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,260
Or guilt over wanting to leave.

940
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:37,060
Rage against John, against God, and...

941
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,350
But...

942
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,900
...then I look at him...

943
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:50,450
...and I force myself to see the man
that I married.

944
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:54,320
And he becomes that man.

945
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,580
He's transformed into someone that I love.

946
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,420
And I'm transformed into someone
who loves him.

947
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,130
It's not all the time, but...

948
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,090
...it's enough.

949
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:19,060
I think John is a very lucky man, Alicia.

950
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,270
So unlucky.

951
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,610
- This is us.
- This is it?

952
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:33,530
It's near where I work.

953
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:36,620
John? You have a visitor.

954
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:40,910
Hi.

955
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,920
I hope it's okay.

956
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:54,260
Hey, chief.

957
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,220
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

958
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:59,930
I quit, actually.

959
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,770
- Hello.
- Hey, John.

960
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:10,190
Have you met Harvey?

961
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:15,320
- There's no...
- Relax, it's okay.

962
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:18,330
There's no point being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.

963
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,160
Jesus Christ. I should have known.

964
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,540
Here you go.

965
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:30,250
- I can take those later.
- You're supposed to take them now.

966
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,720
- Can I bring you something?
- I'm okay.

967
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:36,180
Okay.

968
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,810
So, I was in town giving a workshop.

969
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:45,850
I go back tonight.

970
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:49,400
Bender really wanted to stop by...

971
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,900
...you know, see you. Say hi.

972
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,320
Squeamish?

973
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,070
Yeah.

974
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:59,240
I suppose I would be, too.

975
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:01,790
But, alas, I'm stuck with me.

976
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,790
I'm trying to solve the Riemann hypothesis.

977
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,000
Uh-huh.

978
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,420
Oh, yeah?

979
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,380
I figured if I dazzle them...

980
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,380
...they will have to reinstate me.

981
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:22,350
But it's difficult with the medication...

982
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,520
...because it's hard...

983
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:30,860
...to see the solution.

984
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,780
You know, John, you should go easy.

985
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,620
There are other things besides work.

986
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,710
What are they?

987
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
What are you thinking about?

988
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,550
What do people do?

989
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:35,760
It's life, John.

990
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,260
Activities available, just add meaning.

991
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:50,060
You could try leaving the house.

992
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:52,400
You know, maybe...

993
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,480
...talk to people.

994
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,410
You could try taking out the garbage.

995
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:28,140
And there's some more,
there's some more in...

996
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:42,280
Who were you talking to?

997
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:44,870
Garbage man.

998
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,710
Garbage men don't come at night.

999
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,090
I guess around here they do.

1000
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:28,500
Sorry.

1001
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:37,320
Is it the medication?

1002
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,980
I don't know what to do.

1003
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,300
My mother's going to
keep the baby a little longer tonight.

1004
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:45,340
I can get three hours of overtime.

1005
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:12,950
I'm going to bed.

1006
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,050
- Good night.
- Good night.

1007
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:43,380
It's good to see you, John.

1008
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:46,340
It's been a while.

1009
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:48,630
Parcher?

1010
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:50,800
Yes, sir.

1011
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,390
You're not real!

1012
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:58,480
Of course I am. Don't be ridiculous.

1013
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,650
I don't think that I would go that way.

1014
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:09,610
It's time for you to get back to work.

1015
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:13,240
The bomb is in its final position
here in the U.S.

1016
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:19,750
Knowing your situation requires you
keep a low profile, "Mohammed"...

1017
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:23,630
...we've brought the mountain to you.

1018
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:46,980
We've narrowed the bomb's location
to somewhere on the eastern seaboard.

1019
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,660
But we haven't been able to pinpoint
its exact position.

1020
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:57,080
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1021
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,170
Look at this, John.

1022
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:04,920
What?

1023
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,670
What?

1024
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:12,970
- Dr. Rosen said...
- Rosen! That quack!

1025
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:17,680
"Schizophrenic break from reality,"
right? Psychological bullshit!

1026
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:19,390
Look at me, John.

1027
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,190
John, look at me.

1028
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:26,070
Do I look like I'm imagined?

1029
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,280
Wheeler has no record of you.

1030
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:32,740
Do you think we list our personnel?

1031
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,950
I'm sorry you had to go through all this.

1032
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:41,870
I've gone to a great deal of trouble
to get you back.

1033
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,170
I can restore your status at Wheeler.

1034
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:47,050
I can let the world know what you did.

1035
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,260
But I need you now, soldier.

1036
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,180
I was so scared you weren't real.

1037
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,190
There's a storm coming.

1038
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,690
I'm just going to grab the laundry.

1039
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,820
I'll draw his bath.

1040
01:34:16,530 --> 01:34:17,620
It's okay.

1041
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:20,290
Okay.

1042
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,060
John!

1043
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:10,730
I've almost got it!
Charles, you just watch the baby.

1044
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:12,740
No!

1045
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:21,790
I need a towel.

1046
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:27,500
- Charles was watching him. He was okay.
- There is no one here.

1047
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:30,630
There is no one here!

1048
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:32,840
He's been injected with a cloaking serum.

1049
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:36,760
I can see him because of a chemical
that was released into my bloodstream...

1050
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:38,430
...when my implant dissolved.

1051
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:43,520
I couldn't tell you,
it was for your own protection!

1052
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,310
Alicia!

1053
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:54,440
- No!
- Hello, I need Dr. Rosen's office, please.

1054
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:56,490
You've got to stop her, John.

1055
01:36:58,030 --> 01:37:00,280
You leave her out of this.

1056
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:04,410
- Who are you talking to?
- It's not her fault.

1057
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:07,370
- She'll compromise us again.
- She won't.

1058
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:09,210
You'll go back to the hospital.

1059
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:11,380
- Answer me!
- Countless people will die.

1060
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:13,250
Alicia, please put the phone down.

1061
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:15,720
- I can't let that happen.
- Yes, hello?

1062
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,050
Hi, I need Dr. Rosen. Is he in?

1063
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:21,430
I'm sorry, John.

1064
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:23,350
No!

1065
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:29,980
- You know what you must do.
- Get away from me.

1066
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:32,690
- She's too great a risk.
- Get away!

1067
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,490
I didn't mean to hurt you!

1068
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:40,070
Finish her. She knows too much now.

1069
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,330
Uncle John?

1070
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:49,420
Take care of her, you pathetic
piece of shit, or I'll take care of you.

1071
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:52,880
Christ, John, please do what he says.

1072
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:55,670
Move, soldier.

1073
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,090
Now.

1074
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:58,380
Uncle John?

1075
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,300
John, please!

1076
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:03,970
Now!

1077
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:08,180
Alicia and Charles never
coexist in the same interactive field.

1078
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:09,640
Parcher and Charles...

1079
01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:14,900
Charles and Marcee
cannot coexist with Alicia.

1080
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,360
I understand.

1081
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,760
She never gets old.

1082
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,470
Marcee can't be real. She never gets old.

1083
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:21,680
You see them now?

1084
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:32,600
Yes.

1085
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,400
Why did you stop your meds?

1086
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:41,450
Because I couldn't do my work.

1087
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:43,450
I couldn't help with the baby.

1088
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:45,280
I couldn't...

1089
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:49,040
I couldn't respond to my wife.

1090
01:39:51,790 --> 01:39:54,080
You think that's better than being crazy?

1091
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:58,590
We'll need to start you on a higher run
of insulin shocks and a new medication.

1092
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:00,340
No.

1093
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:04,680
- There has to be another way.
- Schizophrenia is degenerative.

1094
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:08,560
Some days may be symptom-free,
but over time, you are getting worse.

1095
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,690
It's a problem. That's all it is.

1096
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:16,520
It's a problem with no solution.
And that's what I do, I solve problems.

1097
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:18,280
This isn't math.

1098
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,450
You can't come up with a formula to
change the way you experience the world.

1099
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:24,910
- All I have to do is apply my mind.
- There's no theorem, no proof.

1100
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:27,370
- You can't reason your way out of this.
- Why not?

1101
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:30,620
Because your mind is where the problem
is in the first place.

1102
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,670
I can do this.

1103
01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:38,130
I can work it out. All I need is time.

1104
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:43,840
Is that the baby?

1105
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,930
The baby is at my mother's, John.

1106
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:03,860
Without treatment, John...

1107
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:06,990
...the fantasies may take over...

1108
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,330
...entirely.

1109
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:29,060
You almost ready?

1110
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:33,770
Rosen's waiting outside.

1111
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:37,150
I can't go back to that hospital.

1112
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:42,740
I won't come home.

1113
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:48,660
He said that if you said that...

1114
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:52,580
...he has commitment papers
for me to sign.

1115
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:57,420
Well, maybe you won't sign them.

1116
01:41:58,790 --> 01:42:01,050
Maybe you'll just give me some time.

1117
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,840
I will try to figure this out.

1118
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,010
Whatever you do...

1119
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,020
...Rosen is right about one thing.

1120
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:16,640
You shouldn't be here.

1121
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,440
I'm not safe anymore.

1122
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:28,070
Would you have hurt me, John?

1123
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:39,250
I don't know.

1124
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:43,420
Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen
drive you to your mother's.

1125
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:06,030
He told me to leave.

1126
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,370
I understand.

1127
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:53,410
Rosen said to call if you try
and kill me, or anything.

1128
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:12,680
You want to know what's real?

1129
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:19,480
This.

1130
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:28,400
This.

1131
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:35,330
This.

1132
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:39,410
This is real.

1133
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:44,500
Maybe the part...

1134
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:47,510
...that knows the
waking from the dream...

1135
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:50,590
...maybe it isn't here.

1136
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:56,970
Maybe it's here.

1137
01:45:02,190 --> 01:45:04,360
I need to believe...

1138
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:07,490
...that something extraordinary
is possible.

1139
01:46:10,590 --> 01:46:12,340
Come.

1140
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:22,980
Hello, Martin.

1141
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:29,360
Jesus Christ.

1142
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:32,700
No. I...

1143
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:38,200
I don't have that one. My savior complex
takes on a completely different form.

1144
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:41,870
I heard what happened and...

1145
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,710
...I wanted to write,
and I tried you at MacArthur's...

1146
01:46:44,790 --> 01:46:46,960
...but you'd left, and I just...

1147
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:00,970
This is Helinger's old office.

1148
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:02,940
Yeah.

1149
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:05,560
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1150
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:10,480
Seems that you won after all, Martin.

1151
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,530
They were wrong, John. No one wins.

1152
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:17,120
Please, have a seat.

1153
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:20,290
God, it's so good to see you.

1154
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,120
What brings you back to Princeton?

1155
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:26,830
John?

1156
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,340
John, I'm sorry, but you have to tell him.

1157
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:31,670
Tell him you're a genius. You're a genius!

1158
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:34,430
Tell him your work is critical.
John, please!

1159
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,780
Is there any chance
that you could ignore what I just did?

1160
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:56,990
Of course, what are old friends for?

1161
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:01,240
Is that what we are, Martin? Friends?

1162
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:03,620
John, of course.

1163
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:06,580
Of course. We always have been.

1164
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:13,380
Alicia and I think...

1165
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:16,840
...that fitting in,
being part of a community...

1166
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:21,640
...might do me some good.

1167
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:25,730
That a certain level of attachment,
familiar places, familiar people...

1168
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:28,560
...might help me...

1169
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:31,770
...elbow out...

1170
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:36,990
...these certain delusions that I have.

1171
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:45,160
It's a lot to ask, and
now that I'm here...

1172
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:50,000
...I'm quite certain
that you will just say no.

1173
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,760
But I was wondering if
I could hang around.

1174
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:05,940
Huh.

1175
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:12,110
Will you be needing an office?

1176
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:17,780
No.

1177
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:23,120
No, I could just work out of the library.

1178
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:26,080
This guy tries to wander into
the library...

1179
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:29,170
- ...But he has no ID.
- Why can't people read memos?

1180
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:31,040
Then he goes totally nuts.

1181
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:34,050
You're not real! You're not real.

1182
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:35,300
There's no mission.

1183
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:38,010
Oh, shit. Shit.

1184
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:41,550
You're not real! You are not real!

1185
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:44,890
Is this what you are, soldier?
Some useless ghoul?

1186
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:46,980
The local madman?

1187
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:49,810
- I'm not a soldier.
- You'll end up in a cell!

1188
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:51,810
Old, worthless, discarded.

1189
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:53,110
There's no mission.

1190
01:49:53,190 --> 01:49:56,530
While you rock and drool,
the world will burn to ashes!

1191
01:49:56,610 --> 01:49:58,950
You are not real! You are not real!

1192
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:01,070
You're still talking to me, soldier.

1193
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:04,330
There's no mission! I'm not a soldier!

1194
01:50:04,450 --> 01:50:06,120
John? John?

1195
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:11,290
John! It's okay.

1196
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:13,340
I just heard what happened, I'm sorry.

1197
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:15,340
- I'm not a soldier.
- John. Hey, Nash.

1198
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:17,920
Nash, hey. You're all right.

1199
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,640
Nash, hey.

1200
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:29,390
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1201
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:30,730
John?

1202
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:35,070
You should've seen their faces.

1203
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:38,320
Everybody was just staring at me.

1204
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:42,700
John, you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1205
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:45,540
I know.

1206
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,120
But then, on the way home...

1207
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:53,040
...Charles was there.

1208
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:59,420
Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.

1209
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:04,640
Maybe Rosen's right.

1210
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:09,480
Maybe I have to think about going back
into the hospital again.

1211
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:11,980
No. Come here.

1212
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:18,650
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1213
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:46,260
John, now you can't ignore me forever.

1214
01:51:52,230 --> 01:51:54,940
You've been a very good friend to me.

1215
01:51:55,110 --> 01:51:56,360
The best.

1216
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,400
But I won't talk to you again.

1217
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:05,450
I just can't.

1218
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:13,750
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1219
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:23,220
Good-bye.

1220
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:31,770
Good-bye.

1221
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:49,240
I was wondering
if I might audit your course.

1222
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:53,040
It's an honor, Professor Nash.

1223
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:57,960
Is something wrong?

1224
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:01,970
This will be my first class.

1225
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:07,010
Good morning...

1226
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:09,720
...eager young minds.

1227
01:53:30,330 --> 01:53:32,250
It's never going to work, John.

1228
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,170
You're just humiliating yourself.

1229
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:38,960
It's pathetic!

1230
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:41,630
You are being pathetic.

1231
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:43,670
I'm ashamed of you!

1232
01:54:11,450 --> 01:54:13,160
Oh, man!

1233
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:19,880
Are you coming? You're going to be late.

1234
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,880
- Dad, you've got my book.
- What?

1235
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:28,260
- You've got my book.
- Oh, right.

1236
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:29,890
Thanks.

1237
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:32,600
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1238
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:34,390
See you tonight.

1239
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:36,480
Bye, honey.

1240
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:11,320
Did you just solve Riemann?

1241
01:56:11,410 --> 01:56:13,330
Well, what do you think?

1242
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:18,330
That's an analog to Frobenius
for non-commutative extensions.

1243
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:21,040
Yes, it is.

1244
01:56:22,290 --> 01:56:25,050
But it only appears
to work sporadically, so, no.

1245
01:56:25,090 --> 01:56:26,260
But...

1246
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,010
...I believe I'm making progress.

1247
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,010
You're...

1248
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:35,560
You're John Nash, right?

1249
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:40,020
- Toby Kelly.
- Hello.

1250
01:56:40,190 --> 01:56:43,770
I've been studying your equilibrium
that you wrote here at Princeton.

1251
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:46,940
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did...

1252
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:48,700
You know, I was young.

1253
01:56:50,110 --> 01:56:52,240
I've been developing a theory.

1254
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,590
I believe I can prove...

1255
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:11,510
...that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1256
01:57:11,590 --> 01:57:16,260
That everything is connected.
That it's all part of the same subject.

1257
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:19,770
When was the last time you ate?

1258
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:22,400
- Excuse me?
- You know, food.

1259
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,480
Oh, uh...

1260
01:57:24,650 --> 01:57:25,820
My wife...

1261
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:28,360
...she loves mayonnaise.

1262
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:32,030
Thank you.

1263
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:35,330
Go on.

1264
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:37,330
The functor...

1265
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:40,250
...is in the two categories.

1266
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:45,920
Alicia!

1267
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,340
Alicia!

1268
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:51,260
Coming together at a maximum speed of...

1269
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:54,180
...let us say, 10 miles per hour.

1270
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:56,970
So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle "B"...

1271
01:57:57,350 --> 01:58:00,390
...and the fly,
who can travel at 20 miles an hour...

1272
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,650
...leaves the tire of "B"
and flies to the tire of bicycle "A"...

1273
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:06,940
...and backwards and forwards
until the two bikes collide...

1274
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:09,440
...and the poor little fly is squashed.

1275
01:58:09,820 --> 01:58:13,610
This is the important thing about
actually focusing in and comprehending...

1276
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:16,830
...the area you're dealing with.
Mathematics is very specific...

1277
01:58:16,910 --> 01:58:20,370
...and it is an art form, no matter
what people here will tell you...

1278
01:58:20,450 --> 01:58:23,790
...especially people from biology.
Don't listen to those people.

1279
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:27,210
Let me go back to what you were doing.
I might want to steal this...

1280
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:29,130
...write a book and get famous.

1281
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:32,630
I was thinking that I might teach.

1282
01:58:34,510 --> 01:58:37,930
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.

1283
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:42,020
John, besides, you're a terrible teacher.

1284
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,520
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.

1285
01:58:46,730 --> 01:58:49,980
I was hoping there still might be
something I could contribute.

1286
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:51,530
What about the...

1287
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:53,570
Well, you know.

1288
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:55,450
Are they gone?

1289
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:04,420
No, they're not gone.

1290
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,710
And maybe they never will be.

1291
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:10,960
But I've gotten used to ignoring them,
and I think they've given up on me.

1292
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:17,180
You think that's what it's like with all
our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?

1293
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:21,140
You've got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?

1294
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:23,520
John, they haunt you though.

1295
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:28,480
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.

1296
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,860
Well, good-bye.

1297
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:36,410
John, I'll talk to the department.

1298
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:40,240
Maybe in the spring.

1299
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,210
Hey, Nash.

1300
01:59:49,630 --> 01:59:51,920
You, uh...

1301
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:53,510
You scared?

1302
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:57,340
Terrified.

1303
01:59:58,050 --> 02:00:00,430
Mortified. Petrified.

1304
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:02,310
Stupefied by you.

1305
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:05,770
Now you ought best ring Alicia,
or you'll get me...

1306
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:07,940
- I'll ring her.
...in a lot of trouble.

1307
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:13,610
- Thanks, Professor.
- Good-bye.

1308
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:15,030
- Have a nice day.
- Good-bye.

1309
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:18,530
Papers in hand, Mr. Bayer.

1310
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:20,160
Professor Nash?

1311
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:26,710
- Can you see him?
- Yeah.

1312
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:28,130
- You sure?
- Yes.

1313
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:30,420
Positive? He's within your vision?

1314
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,380
Okay. Good.

1315
02:00:32,510 --> 02:00:35,300
Forgive me,
I'm just always suspicious of new people.

1316
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:38,220
- See you next week, Professor.
- See you next week.

1317
02:00:39,010 --> 02:00:43,270
So now that I know that you're real,
who are you, and what can I do for you?

1318
02:00:43,930 --> 02:00:46,440
Professor, my name is Thomas King.

1319
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:47,650
Thomas King?

1320
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:52,070
I'm here to tell you that you're being
considered for the Nobel Prize.

1321
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:02,660
Forgive me, but I'm just
a little stunned.

1322
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:06,160
Over the past years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone...

1323
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:07,920
...of modern economics.

1324
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,170
Suddenly everybody likes that one.

1325
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:14,510
What about my work on other some
such projects like manifold embedding?

1326
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:18,180
The application
of your bargaining problem...

1327
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:22,350
...to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1328
02:01:22,430 --> 02:01:23,890
- Antitrust cases?
- Yes.

1329
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:26,230
I never would have considered that.

1330
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:31,190
Have I just reached some level of
honesty that borders on stupidity?

1331
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:35,070
- No, you haven't.
- I wouldn't have thought of that.

1332
02:01:40,450 --> 02:01:41,950
Shall we have tea?

1333
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:48,170
I don't go in there. I usually
take my sandwich in the library.

1334
02:01:49,330 --> 02:01:52,380
Come on, John. Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1335
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:58,550
Most commercially available brands
of tea are not suitable to my palate.

1336
02:01:58,630 --> 02:01:59,800
I'm not...

1337
02:02:00,180 --> 02:02:03,680
There are some Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough...

1338
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:07,640
I enjoy the flavor that they have.
I have not been in this room...

1339
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:10,810
...for quite some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

1340
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:14,690
Why, thank you, young lady.

1341
02:02:16,570 --> 02:02:20,450
Things have certainly changed
around here. I have a son that age.

1342
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:23,330
Harvard.

1343
02:02:28,410 --> 02:02:29,250
Hmm.

1344
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:34,550
I would have thought the nominations for
the Nobel Prize would've been secret.

1345
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:38,510
I would have thought you'd only
find out if you won or lost.

1346
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:42,680
That is generally the case, yes,
but these are special circumstances.

1347
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:46,100
The awards are substantial.

1348
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:49,810
They require private funding as such...

1349
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:53,360
...the image of the Nobel is...

1350
02:02:55,610 --> 02:02:58,450
I see, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1351
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:03,490
Find out if I would screw
everything up if I actually won?

1352
02:03:05,490 --> 02:03:09,660
Dance around the podium, strip
naked and squawk like a chicken?

1353
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:12,040
Something like that, yes.

1354
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:15,340
Would I embarrass you?

1355
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:21,010
Yes, it is possible.

1356
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:25,600
You see, I...

1357
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:28,930
I am crazy.

1358
02:03:31,230 --> 02:03:33,360
I take the newer medications...

1359
02:03:37,030 --> 02:03:39,650
...but I still see things
that are not here.

1360
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:44,620
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1361
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:50,620
Like a diet of the mind, I choose
not to indulge certain appetites.

1362
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:55,750
Like my appetite for patterns.

1363
02:03:57,710 --> 02:04:01,010
Perhaps my appetite to imagine
and to dream.

1364
02:04:02,470 --> 02:04:04,010
Professor Nash.

1365
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:11,640
It's good to have you here, John.

1366
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:13,520
Thank you.

1367
02:04:18,230 --> 02:04:21,700
- It's an honor, sir.
- Thank you very much.

1368
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:24,490
A privilege, Professor.

1369
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:30,160
Professor.

1370
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:38,340
- Nicely done, John.
- Thank you, Tom.

1371
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:41,090
Thank you.

1372
02:04:42,590 --> 02:04:43,760
Thank you.

1373
02:04:52,850 --> 02:04:54,190
Thank you, Ed.

1374
02:05:02,570 --> 02:05:04,740
That was certainly most unexpected.

1375
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:27,800
Thank you.

1376
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:34,730
I've always believed in numbers.

1377
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:39,110
In the equations and logics
that lead to reason.

1378
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:42,780
But after a lifetime of such pursuits...

1379
02:05:43,610 --> 02:05:46,990
...I ask, what truly is logic?

1380
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:50,450
Who decides reason?

1381
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:55,370
My quest has taken me
through the physical...

1382
02:05:56,290 --> 02:05:57,920
...the metaphysical...

1383
02:05:59,170 --> 02:06:00,710
...the delusional...

1384
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,090
...and back.

1385
02:06:05,970 --> 02:06:09,300
And I have made the most important
discovery of my career.

1386
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:14,060
The most important discovery of my life.

1387
02:06:17,350 --> 02:06:20,400
It is only in the mysterious equations
of love...

1388
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:23,820
...that any logical reasons
can be found.

1389
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,910
I'm only here tonight because of you.

1390
02:06:31,870 --> 02:06:33,790
You are the reason I am.

1391
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:40,670
You are all my reasons.

1392
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:46,590
Thank you.

1393
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:42,770
So nice to have met you.

1394
02:07:45,860 --> 02:07:47,490
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1395
02:07:47,570 --> 02:07:49,780
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1396
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:53,740
- Are you ready to go now?
- Yes, I am.

1397
02:07:53,990 --> 02:07:56,080
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

1398
02:07:56,540 --> 02:07:58,160
Thank you so much.

1399
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:00,710
Thank you.

1400
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:05,380
What is it? What's wrong?

1401
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:11,260
Nothing.

1402
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:13,600
Nothing at all.

1403
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:18,560
- Come with me, young lady.
- Oh.

1404
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:23,650
I have a car outside.
Are you interested in a ride?

1405
02:08:25,230 --> 02:08:26,740
Where's it going to?
