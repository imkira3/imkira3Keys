2
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,803
Why are you frightened, child?

3
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:47,373
I'm disturbed by my visions, Guru Dev.

4
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:50,675
I see strange figures...

5
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,439
in white.

6
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,263
In some strange place full of light.

7
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:04,110
I see a man in some other place
in a blood red coat.

8
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,750
And I see a ring
which shimmers in a blue light.

9
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:17,707
You wish to know the meaning of these
visions, child... come what may?

10
00:01:19,874 --> 00:01:22,947
There was a ring, child. Long ago.

11
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:25,620
It was forged of eternal love.

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,026
One ring made of two rings.

13
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:32,567
To fit together,
both halves had to be pure

14
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,773
at the first moment of love.

15
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:41,184
After much toil,
a match was finally created.

16
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:43,689
The two halves combined...

17
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,460
and formed a single ring.

18
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,166
It is said, that once united...

19
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:53,007
even if separated
by an ocean or an age...

20
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:56,414
they will always reunite.

21
00:01:56,514 --> 00:02:00,353
They are called, "The Lovers."

22
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:10,075
Okay, baby, you're at quarter deck...

23
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:11,812
alpha grid north.

24
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:15,653
Can you check... grid alpha 5 beta?

25
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:17,477
Yeah.

26
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:22,246
Unfortunately, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to get underneath this beam.

27
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:24,503
There's really no way around it, either.

28
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:27,309
I think we're gonna have to leave
this one for next time.

29
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:28,377
Sorry, sweetheart.

30
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:32,720
Allie, take a look at this.
No, Jay, pan back.

31
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,087
- Can we get any closer?
- Okay.

32
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:42,202
I see it. I'm gonna send the little guy
in there because I can't get in.

33
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:43,911
It's a little tight.

34
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,842
Can... can I have high resolution?

35
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:03,398
We're the first people
to see this in 300 years.

36
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:10,375
God, it's beautiful.

37
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:12,466
Since the Naiad sailed from Bombay.

38
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,535
I want to say it's Indian,
but I can't put a date on it.

39
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:18,412
This snake design, I think it's ancient.

40
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:21,444
It could be part of a pair.

41
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,860
Anyway, it was very important
to somebody on our wreck.

42
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,252
- How so?
- You see...

43
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:31,203
the kind of silver purse type thing?

44
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,474
Bears the initials D.E. on it.

45
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:38,282
Whoever D.E. was...
drowned clinging to that purse.

46
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:39,872
Look in yourself, Tulaja.
It will be, thus.

47
00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:44,483
You will love with the full force
of a woman's heart.

48
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,857
And your love will be returned in full.

49
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:50,963
But you will betray your love

50
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:55,135
and as you have foreseen, he will die.

51
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:03,387
Guru Dev, am I such a person, Guru Dev?

52
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:07,005
What beats within your chest, Tulaja?

53
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,466
My heart, Guru Dev.

54
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:13,107
Where else in the universe
is betrayal, Tulaja?

55
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:14,811
If not in the human heart.

56
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:19,119
I will not betray.
I swear not to do so, Guru Dev.

57
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:22,660
- I will not betray.
- Your path is already chosen.

58
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,346
Then I will not love.

59
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:34,762
Allie?

60
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,990
- Laura!
- Allie!

61
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,630
- Hang in there, Laura.
- Where's Jay?

62
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,689
Oh, God, help me.

63
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,175
What the hell was she doing
down there, Allie?

64
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,712
- Laura?
- I can't move it, Jay.

65
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:50,248
I can't move the beam.

66
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:53,360
I'm coming down to get you,
sweetheart. Just stay calm.

67
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:56,225
I'm so sorry, Jay.

68
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,834
Matt, there's no air in any of these.

69
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,740
- We packed the gear away last night.
- I told her not to.

70
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,849
- How much O2 does she have left?
- Ten minutes.

71
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:09,062
I'm sorry, Jay.

72
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:12,525
- Jay.
- Get a RIB out.

73
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:16,231
- I've radioed the coastguard.
- Matt, give me a line.

74
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:25,118
Allie... be honest.
How much time have I got?

75
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,623
Jay! One idiot is enough. Jay!

76
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:47,730
Laura! Laura!

77
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,634
- Allie?
- We're gonna get you out of there.

78
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,671
- How?
- Hang in there, Laura.

79
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:54,694
How, Allie? How are you
gonna do that, Allie?

80
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,982
Paul, here, take this.

81
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,654
How long to free dive 350 feet? Matt!

82
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:03,133
I don't know. The world record's
three minutes. Get that RIB in the water.

83
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:14,784
- I should have stopped her.
- Yeah, so why the hell was she diving?

84
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,823
She wanted to bring the purse up.
It was an anniversary surprise.

85
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:19,280
Really?

86
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,728
What are you doing?

87
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,585
Keep it coming.

88
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:53,626
- Laura, it's gonna be okay.
- No, it is not. He is free diving.

89
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:12,899
Guys, winch up.

90
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,310
Oh, my God. Allie, he's passed out.

91
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,467
- Where's the coastguard?
- They're on the way!

92
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:50,214
I got him. We're coming up.

93
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:52,009
Come on.

94
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:30,989
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

95
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,044
- Oh, God!
- 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

96
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:38,137
Is he okay? Is he okay? Baby? Baby?

97
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:40,875
- 1, 2, 3.
- Oh, honey. Is he okay?

98
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:44,346
- Get the defib!
- Annie, go!

99
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,694
- Oh, shit. Shit.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

100
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:53,868
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I thought I'd lost you. Oh, God.

101
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,841
- Put your head back.
- You are okay, baby?

102
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:01,180
Jay? Keep your head still.
Keep your head still.

103
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:09,066
It's okay. Don't ever do that again.

104
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,235
I'm fine. I'm fine.

105
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:18,785
- Jay, you've...
- Oh, my God.

106
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,855
Oh, God! Oh, God! Jay, are you alright?

107
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,828
- Has he got a pulse?
- He's still got a pulse.

108
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:25,364
- He's breathing.
- Here. Here.

109
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:27,970
Jesus, where's the flashlight?
This is fucking serious.

110
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,205
- Jay!
- Get the defibrillator!

111
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,476
- Come on. Jay.
- Jay, can you hear us?

112
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:32,813
It's coming. They're coming!

113
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:36,613
Jay, where are you?
Can you hear us, Jay? Baby?

114
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:39,289
- Jay!
- Baby?

115
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,446
James.

116
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:06,819
James? James. Brother?

117
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:10,404
It's 4 o'clock.

118
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:15,062
Sorry, I must have dozed off.

119
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,637
4 o'clock?

120
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:21,242
Aye. Desai.

121
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:23,413
- Ji, saheb
- Mera coat.

122
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:26,755
- Ji, sir.
- We'll be late for Governor Hornby.

123
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:31,764
Hindu Stewart, don't they teach you
the purpose of...

124
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:33,532
Clocks in Scotland?

125
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:53,875
God, I hate this place.
It's too hot. It's too crowded.

126
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:57,481
- And it's too far from Scot...
- Massachusetts, Charlie. The farm.

127
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:00,822
I know. But four more years of this?
God!

128
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:03,460
The money we need
can't be saved in a day.

129
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:07,368
James, the governor's meeting,
are you planning on speaking your mind?

130
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,771
Why do you ask, Charlie?

131
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:11,254
Well, I've only just got back
from a month up country building roads

132
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:14,448
- and I'd like to stay here for a bit.
- I thought it was too hot and too crowded.

133
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:17,990
It is, but it's still better
than being up country building roads.

134
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,964
Gentlemen. His Excellency, the governor.

135
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:26,781
- Governor.
- Colonel Egerton, gentlemen, sit.

136
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:30,347
This summer of 1778

137
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:33,985
is our summer of opportunity.

138
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:40,592
Hindu Stewart. Don't they teach you
the purpose of clocks in Scotland?

139
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:43,303
Governor.

140
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:48,183
As I was saying, we English
hold three colonies in India.

141
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:51,122
But unfortunately on opposite coasts.

142
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:56,831
We, here in Bombay,
Madras down there, and Calcutta, here.

143
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:01,711
Gentlemen, imagine
if we could link them up.

144
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,182
We could dominate
the entire subcontinent...

145
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:07,777
to the exclusion of all
other trading companies...

146
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:11,229
And obtain personal riches
beyond our most radical imaginings.

147
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:12,899
Indeed. Indeed.

148
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,805
The most powerful obstacle
to our ambitions...

149
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:17,876
are these kingdoms here.

150
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,649
Bijapur and Purandhar.

151
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:24,021
The present king
is our implacable opponent.

152
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:27,863
However... an opportunity has arisen.

153
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:31,469
An opportunity that will allow
our shareholders

154
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,814
in the East India Company to look
at a map of this subcontinent and say...

155
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,627
Mine.

156
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:45,096
Captain Stewart hardly seems
welcoming to this opportunity.

157
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:49,541
James?

158
00:13:50,173 --> 00:13:52,723
It is quite clear to me, sir,

159
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:55,914
and to you, governor
and to many others in this room

160
00:13:56,014 --> 00:13:59,258
that building an empire
in India is not the policy

161
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:02,766
- of His Majesty's government in London.
- A fine point.

162
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:06,072
London is a long way away,
Captain Stewart.

163
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:09,746
Getting a reply from them
can take a year...

164
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:11,871
as you know.

165
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,892
Far better to present London
with a fait accompli

166
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:18,798
than wait passively for their approval.

167
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,968
Far wiser to wait

168
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,611
than to stir up a hornet's nest without
the means to contain it, Colonel Egerton.

169
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:29,151
Gentlemen, the die is cast.

170
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:33,513
In a month it will not serve us
to debate, but seize the day

171
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:36,565
- and seize the place.
- Hear, hear.

172
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,914
Tulaja...

173
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:37,154
a little pigeon told me
you can prophesize.

174
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,358
Highness, I can't.

175
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,816
Tulaja, you are no longer
just guarding a queen.

176
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,673
You're also guarding a prince
or a princess.

177
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:48,276
Highness.

178
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:52,619
Please tell me, Tulaja.
What future do you see for my child?

179
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,538
Highness,

180
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,396
these visions, they just come to me.
I cannot call them at will.

181
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:01,135
Oh, come on, tell me something.
No matter how small.

182
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:05,041
- Tell me, tell me, tell me.
- Highness, I can't. I really can't.

183
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:10,855
Well, this is for you, my dear guard.

184
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:13,042
Please forgive my silliness.

185
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:18,003
It's magic, so my grandmother said.

186
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:22,478
Anyway, it's ancient and precious.
Even though it is flawed.

187
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,112
And you know what they say,
they say it brings lovers together

188
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:29,760
and keeps them together. Do you like it?

189
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,951
Tulaja,

190
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:37,407
if you ever have the chance
of love, grab it.

191
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:42,348
And you will be richer
than I will ever be.

192
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,402
We are betrayed.

193
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:53,707
The king's brother is a traitor.
It's a coup.

194
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:56,578
Go, warn the king! Go, warn the king!

195
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:02,492
Gauri, Gauri, the queen in danger!
Shut the doors! Protect the queen.

196
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:09,103
Katamaji, the king's in danger.
Get the guard.

197
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:16,582
Tulaja.

198
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,277
Why? You have everything that you need.

199
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:37,413
Not everything.

200
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:41,556
Not yet... Your Majesty.

201
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:43,927
On your knees, you jackals!

202
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:46,833
You are in the presence of your lord.

203
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,838
You old buffoon.
Have you lost your mind?

204
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:05,035
Shrimant, please, I beg you.

205
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:06,405
Spare me.

206
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,020
Sadly, Munajee...

207
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,592
life is brutal.

208
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:16,022
I'm sorry.

209
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,109
Salim.

210
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:35,795
- Get him, go.
- Go, Pawan.

211
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:47,670
I'll have to break the arrow off, Tulaja.
Just be brave, okay? Be brave.

212
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:04,655
Sonubai? Sona.

213
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:08,095
Wife! Sona...

214
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:10,127
Sonu?

215
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,707
What you had asked for is done...

216
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:18,241
- my queen.
- It is done?

217
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:19,684
Yes.

218
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:26,068
My king, I'm queen.

219
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,055
- Udaji.
- Father.

220
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,416
- What happened?
- The king is deposed.

221
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:42,063
- He's dead.
- Who killed him? Raoji?

222
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:44,368
Yes. Raoji.

223
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,500
- I must go back.
- Get her in.

224
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:49,022
I must go back to the queen.

225
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,358
James. James.

226
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,594
Charlie.

227
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:03,339
That's from Governor Hornby.

228
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,474
Oh, aye.

229
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:15,595
Colonel Egerton has seized the day.

230
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,906
There's been a coup in Purandhar.

231
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:22,079
The king?

232
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,535
Assassinated.

233
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,757
We have to get there post-haste.

234
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:34,936
"Upon completion of this mission,
you shall receive 1,000 gold sovereigns?"

235
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:38,108
Well, Massachusetts here we come!

236
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,580
- Maybe. Joost!
- Sir!

237
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:45,261
Have the men strike camp.
Desai, we leave at once.

238
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:57,334
Well...

239
00:21:57,434 --> 00:22:02,422
your father will be pleased that we have
Captain Stewart to escort us to Pahadpur.

240
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,764
Does Captain Stewart know
you're in love with him?

241
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:09,401
Dolly, enough! Enough!

242
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:16,251
- Tulaja, it's too soon.
- Udaji, I need to do this.

243
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:19,157
Yes, but you haven't fully
recovered yet, Tulaja. Please.

244
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:22,796
We need a spy at the palace.
You said so yourself.

245
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,116
Let me come with you.

246
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:29,144
Stay here and help your father, Udaji.

247
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:33,717
That is your duty and I must do mine.

248
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,813
Goodbye, my friend.

249
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:50,854
In every breath of wind,
there's a word and that word is shame.

250
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,359
I can hear it in the rustle
of every leaf.

251
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:57,699
- Can you live under the rule of a coward?
- No!

252
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:04,077
Because we will all be cowards if we fail
to avenge the murder of our king!

253
00:23:09,624 --> 00:23:14,500
Twenty years I served
as chief minister to his father.

254
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,973
I, Mudhoji Kiledar

255
00:23:17,073 --> 00:23:19,810
will destroy the usurper Raoji,
I swear it!

256
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:36,128
The palace is called the Rajwada.

257
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:40,352
- Magnificent, isn't it?
- Is that where we're going to stay?

258
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,062
- Does the king have a harem?
- I don't think so, Dolly.

259
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:47,918
But doubtless she'll ask him.

260
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:03,907
My Lord...

261
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:12,761
I know you fear that your enemies
will rally around the dead king's heir.

262
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:20,329
Why don't you let me give... you an heir
of your own. They can rally around him?

263
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:23,668
We must kill the queen.

264
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:27,145
Now, you're king...

265
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:30,512
next, you'll be emperor.

266
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:19,199
- Queen.
- What are you doing here?

267
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,318
Highness.

268
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:25,629
Not so high anymore. You're wounded.

269
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:31,241
No, Highness, I'm fine.

270
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:33,879
They mean to kill me.

271
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:36,117
They can't.

272
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:40,292
No one can do anything to you.
No one's going to hurt you.

273
00:25:40,392 --> 00:25:43,262
They mustn't know I'm pregnant.

274
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:45,695
I swore to them I'm not.

275
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,049
Go! Go!

276
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,157
It is usual to stand
when a queen enters.

277
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:58,997
When a queen enters, I will stand.

278
00:25:59,097 --> 00:26:03,670
I've brought peach oil for your hair...

279
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:06,587
after we've washed it.

280
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:11,753
Just like old times.

281
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:16,699
Have you put weight on?

282
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:19,521
I think so.

283
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,290
My husband says we must
take great care of you.

284
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,994
He's a king now.

285
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:34,701
And a king's disapproval is worse
than a husband's disapp...

286
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,106
My husband thinks he's a lion.

287
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:42,080
But like most cats
if I stroke him in the right way...

288
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,626
he just rolls over.

289
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,097
He won't save you. Not for long.

290
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:03,191
- Your Majesty, this is a great honor.
- Yes.

291
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,129
Your Majesty...

292
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:10,873
Her Majesty, my wife,
wants ex-queen Jamnabai dead.

293
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:17,127
You know what women are like.
And I do see some merit in the idea.

294
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:21,804
His Majesty,

295
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:24,029
my king...

296
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:26,703
wishes her alive.

297
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,780
She's with a child.

298
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,072
A rival heir to my throne is a cause
for my enemies to fight for.

299
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:38,926
With our king's support,
you outnumber your enemies.

300
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:43,305
If Queen Jamnabai dies,
you forfeit that support.

301
00:27:43,405 --> 00:27:44,741
That is a matter for...

302
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:49,648
With respect,
it is our king's strict stipulation.

303
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:59,133
I'm to escort the queen
to Bombay forthwith.

304
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,957
- Take her.
- Your Majesty.

305
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:14,408
I...

306
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:22,249
The palace gates will be left unlocked.
You must leave within 3 hours.

307
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:24,384
Good luck.

308
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,740
- Highness.
- Did you hear?

309
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,892
Bombay's far away.

310
00:28:35,992 --> 00:28:39,350
We have a chance of getting rescued
before we reach there.

311
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,322
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Highness.

312
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:46,295
I have a plan.
If you will permit me to explain.

313
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:54,815
This is damnable, sire.

314
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:57,453
Did you advise the governor
of this change of course?

315
00:28:57,554 --> 00:28:59,512
I did not, colonel.

316
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:03,431
The change of ruler here is in
the company's best interest, captain.

317
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:05,435
Shit, sir, it took 3 years of planning.

318
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,508
I'm England's servant, colonel,
not the company's.

319
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:12,181
As are you in the final analysis...
unless I'm mistaken.

320
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,357
Well, captain...

321
00:29:16,457 --> 00:29:21,267
I charge you with the safety
of my daughter and of her governess.

322
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:24,838
If anything should befall them,
I shall come for you.

323
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:31,422
Hindu Stewart... I shall come for you.

324
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:43,579
Don't push! You'll get seen...

325
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,549
I can't see why we
can't just take the carriage.

326
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,656
Because your father
needs a carriage here.

327
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:51,160
- But this is a box.
- This is not a box.

328
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,066
This is a royal carriage.
Queens travel in this.

329
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,242
Highness.

330
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:05,386
I'm sorry. We must hurry.

331
00:30:05,922 --> 00:30:06,914
Thank you.

332
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:20,553
Sir, this thing's worse
than an oyster's fart. They knows it.

333
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:24,226
Runnin' around this scurvy place
with a gaggle of females.

334
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:27,734
We have our orders, Joost. Under duty.

335
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:32,376
Aye. But duty never made a rotten order
sweet did it, Captain Stewart?

336
00:30:32,476 --> 00:30:34,781
Let's move out, Joost.

337
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:38,853
Company form up. Make ready to move.

338
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:18,964
We've been traveling
all night and half a day.

339
00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:21,810
I'm seasick.
We're not even on the sea.

340
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:25,315
Why couldn't we have stayed in Pahadpur?

341
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:28,424
Your father told us twenty times
we'd been made hostages.

342
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:31,394
I'd rather be a hostage
than throw up in this thing.

343
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:32,931
Oh, golly.

344
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:37,239
No, I really feel sick.
I need some brandy.

345
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:40,233
Yes, but we don't have any brandy.

346
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:44,520
Yes, we do.

347
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:48,127
I liberated it from pop's bag
before we left.

348
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:51,004
It's bad for his gout, anyway.

349
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,458
- Captain.
- Is all well, Highness?

350
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:06,136
Sorry about the pace of our travel.

351
00:32:07,265 --> 00:32:10,305
- You look worried, captain.
- No, Highness.

352
00:32:10,405 --> 00:32:14,213
Really? I saw some men
in the hills. Following us.

353
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:17,885
Aye. Possibly Raoji's men.

354
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:21,847
Possibly.

355
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,182
Oh, Krishna.

356
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:35,049
They chose the wrong queen.

357
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:42,603
Are you ready?

358
00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:45,241
It's a large escort, Your Highness.

359
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:48,867
I'm paying a large price.

360
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:59,336
After her, slit her open

361
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:04,376
pull the baby out and bring it to me.

362
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:23,102
Stunning woman, Her Highness.

363
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:27,259
Never see a face like that
on Clyde Street.

364
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,638
James, are we going
to be in for a fight?

365
00:33:31,568 --> 00:33:35,508
I think they may try to ambush us
at the bridge at Dwarka.

366
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:37,279
If we pass it by nightfall,
we'll be safe.

367
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:40,986
We'll be outnumbered ten to one,
if it comes to an ambush, won't we?

368
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,838
- Desperate times...
- Desperate measures.

369
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:07,770
Let's see how their dog sepoys deal
with what you have in store, little man.

370
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:30,110
Don't mention it to anyone.

371
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:35,526
Let's move. Let's go. Come on.

372
00:34:36,396 --> 00:34:37,566
Is all in order, Joost?

373
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:40,639
Aye. The ladies are sleepin'.
All of them.

374
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,212
You'll be under my brother's command.
Remember, quiet as a snake.

375
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:46,383
You don't want them waking up. Go to it.

376
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:49,656
Good luck, sir. Alright, let's move.

377
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:44,773
Run, sepoy dogs!

378
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,033
Throw me your lance.

379
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:10,887
Desai!

380
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:20,135
Capture the queen.

381
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,117
Get back and fight.

382
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:45,238
Come on.

383
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,286
I'm never drinking brandy again.

384
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:53,187
Good.

385
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:55,443
Come.

386
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,901
Dolly.

387
00:38:05,313 --> 00:38:07,553
Charles saheb.

388
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:09,757
Charles saheb

389
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,940
James saheb is here.

390
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,733
- Did it go well?
- Yes, sir.

391
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:15,745
James!

392
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:20,338
Once you were asleep, we hid you
in the hay carts. Out of danger.

393
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:23,871
- You drugged us?
- Your Highness...

394
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,559
take my word for it.
You were better off asleep.

395
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:30,832
Our attackers intended to kill you.
Not to rescue you.

396
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:32,770
Then let us go.

397
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,116
Your Highness, I've been charged
with the duty of escorting you to Bombay.

398
00:38:36,216 --> 00:38:40,719
And I can guarantee you that you'll be safe
as long as you are in my custody.

399
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,826
And do you have enough men
to honor such a guarantee?

400
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:45,878
Yes, Your Highness.

401
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:51,941
Without guides you'll get lost.

402
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:55,916
For the last 4 years I've been surveying
this country, Highness.

403
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:59,176
We'll take back roads,
but we won't get lost.

404
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,237
I need some water. Come.

405
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:22,736
James, you made me throw up.

406
00:39:22,836 --> 00:39:25,481
No, Dolly, you took your own poison.

407
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:29,717
Oh, this... this isn't mine.
Clara likes to drink.

408
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:33,307
Forgive me, ladies, but it was a very
mild opiate and I needed total silence.

409
00:39:34,826 --> 00:39:36,679
Men.

410
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:38,333
I'm sorry.

411
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:40,705
You don't need to apologize, James.

412
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:43,745
Actually, I greatly admire
your imagination.

413
00:39:44,245 --> 00:39:46,553
Thank you, Ms. Coldstream.

414
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,064
Stop it.

415
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,562
Hey, here's a dowry.

416
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:21,205
Use it to find a husband

417
00:40:21,305 --> 00:40:23,665
that is less stubborn.

418
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:26,735
I know where they are.

419
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:30,733
Towards Dhar.

420
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:50,645
The royal palanquin burnt,
but you saw no bodies.

421
00:40:50,745 --> 00:40:51,781
No, father.

422
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:54,620
It's vital that our people
know the queen is alive.

423
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,329
They'll fight loyally for her and her child.
Without her, we cannot succeed.

424
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:00,765
Stewart is coming.

425
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:06,509
Udaji, if the queen is alive, find her.
And for all our sakes, make it swift.

426
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,246
I doubt you will be
the only one looking.

427
00:41:19,635 --> 00:41:20,908
They've cut us off.

428
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:25,010
Well?

429
00:41:26,548 --> 00:41:29,050
We'll skirt through on the back of them.

430
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:31,260
We take the dragon's throat.

431
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:34,920
- Okay, chalo.
- Dragon's throat?

432
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,474
- We'll have to abandon the animals.
- That's the idea, Charlie.

433
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:42,111
Desai, what is the dragon's throat?

434
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,793
Keep it going. That's it.

435
00:41:52,768 --> 00:41:55,192
Nice and steady, lads.

436
00:41:56,843 --> 00:41:58,176
Oh, my God!

437
00:41:58,276 --> 00:41:59,776
No, no, no. I can't.

438
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:01,319
Tulaja.

439
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,151
No one is looking.

440
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:06,630
- It's very safe.
- Don't laugh.

441
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,738
- Your Highness, can you run?
- Yes, for my child, I'll fly.

442
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:12,809
Go.

443
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:26,203
I think we're supposed to be
going up the waterfall...

444
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,605
ladies.

445
00:42:38,826 --> 00:42:41,898
- Charlie.
- Alright, lads.

446
00:42:57,063 --> 00:42:59,068
Is she alright?

447
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:01,205
Yes. She hurt her ankle on a rock.

448
00:43:01,305 --> 00:43:04,847
So for the most part, she's fine.
They're both fine.

449
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:06,771
Both?

450
00:43:06,871 --> 00:43:10,625
Yes, if I'm not mistaken,
the girl is with child.

451
00:43:10,725 --> 00:43:14,062
But if we keep up this pace,
she could lose the baby.

452
00:43:54,912 --> 00:43:57,050
Would you have really shot us, captain?

453
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,121
Aye.

454
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:00,392
I really would have.

455
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:06,135
My servant's not too well. I must go.

456
00:44:06,235 --> 00:44:09,245
The queen should rest
for a while, don't you think?

457
00:44:12,513 --> 00:44:14,277
It's alright.

458
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,490
I won't reveal who she is...

459
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:19,224
Your Highness.

460
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:24,060
You know who I am...

461
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,309
but still you call me highness.

462
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:30,466
I know who you're not. Not who you are.

463
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,828
Someone once told me...

464
00:44:35,928 --> 00:44:40,237
that the God Lord Krishna
married three princesses.

465
00:44:40,337 --> 00:44:43,243
And they lived in a palace
made of silver.

466
00:44:43,343 --> 00:44:46,216
One day, Krishna fell incurably ill.

467
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:50,211
A doctor was called.
And he told the God,

468
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:52,962
the only cure for his illness

469
00:44:53,062 --> 00:44:56,118
was dust from the foot
of a generous woman.

470
00:44:56,603 --> 00:45:01,278
But you see the princesses,
they had no dust on their feet.

471
00:45:01,378 --> 00:45:04,787
So they could not cure Krishna
no matter how much they wished to.

472
00:45:06,188 --> 00:45:09,663
The doctor did find dust, however.

473
00:45:09,763 --> 00:45:12,740
On the foot of a poor shepherd girl.

474
00:45:13,803 --> 00:45:16,208
And that dust

475
00:45:16,308 --> 00:45:19,040
to the fury of the princesses...

476
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,220
cured Lord Krishna of his illness.

477
00:45:27,396 --> 00:45:29,443
Who are you?

478
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:37,885
Why don't you ask Lord Krishna?

479
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:42,083
You seem to believe
he has all the answers.

480
00:46:00,195 --> 00:46:02,723
They are not using the roads.

481
00:46:03,736 --> 00:46:07,475
Englishman is a fox,
but I know how he thinks.

482
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,623
Salim! We'll need extra men.
Send for Bhavan at the Rajwada. Go!

483
00:46:25,345 --> 00:46:27,883
Well, brother.

484
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:32,193
We are off the map.

485
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:34,666
That ruined fort down by the river.

486
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:37,137
We can rest there for the night.

487
00:46:37,638 --> 00:46:39,534
James.

488
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:44,853
We've been doing this for a week.
Are we going to be be alright?

489
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:49,499
Oh, don't worry. They won't find us.
Even we don't know where we are.

490
00:47:16,715 --> 00:47:18,886
Captain.

491
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:21,525
I brought you some water.

492
00:47:34,383 --> 00:47:36,623
It seems you know a lot
about my country.

493
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:39,022
I build roads.

494
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:42,935
When you build a road across a country

495
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:45,814
you soon see its soul.

496
00:47:49,848 --> 00:47:51,979
It appears you like what you see.

497
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:54,626
Aye.

498
00:47:54,726 --> 00:47:57,044
I like what I see.

499
00:48:04,678 --> 00:48:07,500
I've grown to like it very much.

500
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:11,560
The English are my enemy.

501
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,221
I'm not so fond of them myself.

502
00:48:16,902 --> 00:48:18,506
I'm from Scotland.

503
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,946
My grandfather supported
a Scottish king.

504
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:24,454
When the English won...

505
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:28,323
my family lost everything.

506
00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:33,120
This was our way out.

507
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,845
When we've saved enough
my brother and I plan to buy a farm

508
00:48:37,945 --> 00:48:40,180
in America.

509
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:43,997
America?

510
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:47,083
Massachusetts.

511
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,572
We'll leave when we're discharged.

512
00:48:56,414 --> 00:48:59,168
Why won't you tell me your name?

513
00:49:00,923 --> 00:49:03,963
It's not the custom of my country

514
00:49:04,063 --> 00:49:07,598
for a woman to give her name
to a stranger.

515
00:49:08,004 --> 00:49:10,491
Especially an English stranger.

516
00:49:11,979 --> 00:49:13,884
Yes.

517
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,492
Especially...

518
00:49:16,593 --> 00:49:18,852
an English stranger.

519
00:49:25,105 --> 00:49:29,445
Perhaps, you should hand us over
to our pursuers.

520
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:34,589
This would be to your advantage.

521
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:40,533
I would not.

522
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:56,907
Is this a custom of your country?

523
00:49:57,402 --> 00:50:00,556
I cannot blame my actions on Scotland.

524
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:16,809
They say...

525
00:50:16,909 --> 00:50:20,248
that death is our fate...

526
00:50:20,348 --> 00:50:23,386
and tomorrow's the end of us.

527
00:50:24,724 --> 00:50:27,301
And do you believe them?

528
00:50:30,636 --> 00:50:32,540
Yes.

529
00:50:51,543 --> 00:50:54,081
What is your name?

530
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,515
Tulaja Naik.

531
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:04,101
Tulaja Naik.

532
00:51:57,342 --> 00:51:59,481
Set the dummies here...

533
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:01,518
and... here.

534
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,590
That should lure them
into the courtyard here.

535
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:07,074
James, is it not coldhearted
to continue on this escapade

536
00:52:07,174 --> 00:52:09,534
with such a pregnant girl.

537
00:52:09,635 --> 00:52:12,140
Or do you not care about such things?

538
00:52:12,941 --> 00:52:15,781
I do. As it happens.

539
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:18,316
I'm sorry.

540
00:52:20,723 --> 00:52:22,962
But if we cannot hold them...

541
00:52:23,663 --> 00:52:26,435
I assume they are not the kind
of people who take prisoners.

542
00:52:26,535 --> 00:52:27,624
Clara.

543
00:52:28,906 --> 00:52:34,551
With you and Dolly to defend us
I do not think it will come to that.

544
00:52:37,756 --> 00:52:39,489
Yes.

545
00:53:38,846 --> 00:53:42,930
Dolly, for God's sake,
be an Egerton. Reload!

546
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:33,055
They are my people.

547
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:51,356
I'll wait for you down by the river.

548
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:53,332
Aye.

549
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,605
Havan, let's find those boats. Come on.

550
00:55:09,426 --> 00:55:12,634
You are free, Your Highness,
to go back to your people.

551
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:14,938
What will they do, captain?

552
00:55:15,038 --> 00:55:18,440
Your English, when they find out?

553
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,217
They'll cashier me or...

554
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,923
court martial me, or hang me.

555
00:55:24,023 --> 00:55:25,891
Perhaps all three.

556
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:37,383
Why, captain?

557
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:40,022
They don't take too kindly
to disobeying orders.

558
00:55:40,122 --> 00:55:42,859
No, why are you letting us go?

559
00:55:47,502 --> 00:55:50,339
Her child will die, if I don't.

560
00:55:52,178 --> 00:55:54,378
Come with us.

561
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,623
I'll be honored.

562
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:01,281
I can't.

563
00:56:02,265 --> 00:56:04,564
I'm not a traitor.

564
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,756
Tulaja Naik!

565
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:42,978
May Bhawarti bless you with good luck.

566
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:46,089
Always.

567
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,222
James...

568
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:29,571
you sentimental bloody idiot.

569
00:57:42,031 --> 00:57:44,763
Captain! Captain!

570
00:57:55,959 --> 00:57:57,158
Halt!

571
00:58:06,012 --> 00:58:07,781
Captain!

572
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:36,491
- Is he alright?
- I think so.

573
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,714
You said that they will hang you
if you don't take back a princess.

574
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,189
Now you will.

575
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:53,629
But when they discover...

576
00:59:53,729 --> 00:59:56,067
They don't even know
what the queen looks like.

577
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:58,253
No,

578
00:59:58,754 --> 00:59:59,921
it's too dangerous.

579
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:03,514
By the time they realize,
I will have escaped.

580
01:00:03,615 --> 01:00:08,258
It's not that easy.
However polite they seem...

581
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:10,640
they'll put you under guard.

582
01:00:10,996 --> 01:00:13,732
This is my country...

583
01:00:15,103 --> 01:00:18,444
where you foreigners
see a crack in the rock

584
01:00:18,544 --> 01:00:19,825
I see a door.

585
01:00:20,816 --> 01:00:24,888
When I'm gone,
no blame will attach to you.

586
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:45,816
Is there someone waiting for you...
in Massachusetts?

587
01:00:47,134 --> 01:00:49,604
It's an odd thing.

588
01:00:53,113 --> 01:00:57,052
Whenever I imagine happiness
with another person...

589
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,798
I have this premonition
that I won't be allowed it.

590
01:01:06,506 --> 01:01:09,077
How sad that is, captain.

591
01:01:16,185 --> 01:01:18,197
So, Tulaja Naik has gone
with the British?

592
01:01:18,297 --> 01:01:20,435
To distract my pursuers.

593
01:01:20,535 --> 01:01:23,775
So, they would still believe
I'm in their hands.

594
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:28,619
- She did an honorable thing.
- Sleep now. Jamnabai, rest.

595
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,889
Rest for the sake
of the new soul you carry.

596
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:40,174
Allow me to attack the boat, father.

597
01:01:40,274 --> 01:01:43,548
Udaji, there are two things about the British
that really wake my insecurities.

598
01:01:43,649 --> 01:01:46,220
First is their artillery and second
is the uncanny abilities

599
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,592
some British have to touch
the hearts of our people.

600
01:01:48,692 --> 01:01:51,127
Father, I can do this.

601
01:01:57,976 --> 01:02:01,016
Let this Captain Stewart make landfall.

602
01:02:01,116 --> 01:02:05,188
Then Tulaja Naik is to be taken
from their hands and brought here.

603
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:26,832
Hurry up, hurry up. Out. Come on.

604
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,772
My king!

605
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:30,843
No longer a king.

606
01:02:30,943 --> 01:02:34,549
Ex-queen Jamnabai has been taken
from the British by Killedar.

607
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,090
He has raised an army.
It's going to destroy us.

608
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,929
Why are you doing this?

609
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:45,237
My enemies now have their queen
and the British have abandoned me.

610
01:02:45,337 --> 01:02:49,296
You said we could trust the British.
Where are the soldiers they promised us?

611
01:02:49,396 --> 01:02:52,329
They move us around
like pieces on a chessboard.

612
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,924
Who knows what their next move would be.

613
01:02:55,024 --> 01:02:58,549
So, you abandoned your throne
like a coward?

614
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:04,911
You're free to come with us
if you can find yourself a horse.

615
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:08,442
And what? Live the rest of my life
scurrying around like a rat?

616
01:03:12,157 --> 01:03:15,796
Look at us. A rat and a viper.

617
01:03:17,501 --> 01:03:20,609
- My lord!
- Stay here, woman, with your animal.

618
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:24,581
When hunger strikes, you'll soon know
which of you is the stronger.

619
01:03:34,335 --> 01:03:37,230
Dolly! Dolly!

620
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:40,113
Dolly!

621
01:03:40,213 --> 01:03:42,128
Look!

622
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:50,034
Oh, heaven! We're saved.

623
01:03:50,134 --> 01:03:52,322
Oh, my God!

624
01:03:52,605 --> 01:03:54,596
Saved.

625
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:06,934
Your alliance with Raoji
and his cowardice

626
01:04:07,034 --> 01:04:11,844
has left us mightily exposed.
Don't you think, colonel?

627
01:04:11,944 --> 01:04:14,249
On the contrary, governor

628
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:20,494
I believe his predicament
gives us a greater opportunity.

629
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:23,532
Which we shall leap
to take advantage of.

630
01:04:25,538 --> 01:04:31,049
I propose, we invade
Purandhar fort with...

631
01:04:31,149 --> 01:04:37,092
Restore Raoji to the throne
under certain new conditions.

632
01:04:37,895 --> 01:04:40,968
Which I have negotiated.

633
01:04:41,068 --> 01:04:43,016
Gold!

634
01:04:43,116 --> 01:04:46,173
Bullion bars and coins!

635
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:50,321
Five hundred thousand ounces per year

636
01:04:50,421 --> 01:04:52,025
for five years.

637
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:56,099
Payable to the company.
Calculate your bonuses, gentlemen.

638
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:57,535
Yum, yum.

639
01:04:57,636 --> 01:05:02,178
Yes and with the ex-queen
still our guest...

640
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:04,770
we still have, in reserve,

641
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:09,118
a bargaining chip
we can use on the either side.

642
01:05:10,126 --> 01:05:11,497
Which ever way it goes.

643
01:05:11,898 --> 01:05:14,235
But... London.

644
01:05:14,335 --> 01:05:18,244
Gentlemen, his majesty's government
will strenuously object to all this.

645
01:05:18,344 --> 01:05:25,423
I think the vast sum of money involved
will mollify their scruples.

646
01:05:25,523 --> 01:05:26,958
Indeed.

647
01:05:27,058 --> 01:05:32,171
And while it maybe argued that the Colonel
Egerton has stirred up a hornet's nest.

648
01:05:32,271 --> 01:05:37,080
We can, now, this time,
rightfully plead...

649
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,179
self defense.

650
01:05:39,419 --> 01:05:41,988
War, it is then!

651
01:05:43,226 --> 01:05:44,839
War!

652
01:06:02,497 --> 01:06:03,781
James!

653
01:06:06,172 --> 01:06:10,214
It appears we're officially at war.
I have to leave tomorrow.

654
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:13,484
We must address the issue,
of your escape.

655
01:06:27,882 --> 01:06:30,117
Is everything alright?

656
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:36,312
Guru Dev.

657
01:06:36,412 --> 01:06:38,569
Am I such a person, Guru Dev?

658
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:49,418
I've dreamt of this moment.

659
01:06:49,518 --> 01:06:51,559
Tulaja.

660
01:06:55,203 --> 01:06:57,617
Will you forgive me if I speak my mind?

661
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:09,449
You have deeply touched me
with your person,

662
01:07:09,549 --> 01:07:13,681
with your wisdom, your courage,

663
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:15,031
your canniness.

664
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:20,755
If you could find it in your heart,
to reciprocate.

665
01:07:20,855 --> 01:07:24,833
- My happiness would be immeasurable.
- James!

666
01:07:25,564 --> 01:07:28,705
I never thought it would be
in my luck to love.

667
01:07:28,805 --> 01:07:32,926
But plainly, as you see,
I'm in love with you.

668
01:07:33,479 --> 01:07:36,686
I have nothing to offer you but myself.

669
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,922
My loyalty.

670
01:07:40,426 --> 01:07:42,596
Tulaja!

671
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,269
Dare I hope.

672
01:08:01,936 --> 01:08:04,105
James.

673
01:08:05,476 --> 01:08:08,547
I have closed my heart tight.

674
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,729
I cannot.

675
01:08:18,502 --> 01:08:20,818
You cannot?

676
01:08:21,176 --> 01:08:24,096
My heart is closed, James.

677
01:08:29,457 --> 01:08:31,730
You must look elsewhere.

678
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:34,065
Why?

679
01:08:35,202 --> 01:08:38,173
Why is your heart closed?

680
01:08:41,883 --> 01:08:43,941
Tulaja!

681
01:08:44,688 --> 01:08:46,901
Look at me.

682
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:52,296
Please.

683
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:22,128
Well, then I'm... I'm taking it back...

684
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:28,637
Please, forgive me
if I have misread your heart.

685
01:09:36,559 --> 01:09:39,097
I must organize your escape.

686
01:09:41,434 --> 01:09:43,112
It's not necessary.

687
01:09:44,141 --> 01:09:49,285
You told me that a Maharatha
does not like to be outdone

688
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,921
in paying a debt of honor.

689
01:09:53,693 --> 01:09:56,177
Neither does a Scott.

690
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,104
Tulaja Naik.

691
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:59,890
The guards change
in twenty minutes. Go, go!

692
01:11:13,218 --> 01:11:16,165
Return the key, quickly. Now, go, go.

693
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:25,035
Damn him!

694
01:11:25,499 --> 01:11:28,282
It fucking bit me.

695
01:11:28,382 --> 01:11:29,886
Damn it!

696
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:31,757
Desai!

697
01:11:31,857 --> 01:11:34,927
Sahib! Shoes.

698
01:11:37,784 --> 01:11:39,382
Well...

699
01:11:39,482 --> 01:11:43,044
I might as well check on the queen.

700
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:46,127
Get me the keys.

701
01:11:49,424 --> 01:11:51,960
We must be quick.

702
01:11:53,115 --> 01:11:55,702
Come on, quickly. Come on!

703
01:12:12,503 --> 01:12:13,941
Sir!

704
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:17,581
Sir, Raoji has come from Kalyan.

705
01:12:17,681 --> 01:12:19,051
Dash it.

706
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:24,125
It's not one pissing little pest,
it's another.

707
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:37,421
Escaped! Escaped!

708
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:40,594
The door was locked. I had the key.

709
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:42,932
Desai!

710
01:12:43,032 --> 01:12:45,872
This is treachery, damn it,
not the fucking road trick.

711
01:12:45,972 --> 01:12:49,513
Call out the guard. Find her.

712
01:12:49,614 --> 01:12:53,851
Stewart, something fishy going on.
Well, I'll sniff it out.

713
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:48,620
You are a part of time...

714
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:53,536
what the ancients called sarwadaiti.

715
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:57,913
That's which contains everything.

716
01:14:10,372 --> 01:14:13,043
I feel you there, Jay.

717
01:14:15,482 --> 01:14:17,220
Where are you, baby?

718
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,795
Where are you, baby?

719
01:14:25,302 --> 01:14:27,639
Where are you?

720
01:14:28,943 --> 01:14:32,443
Damn it! Damn it!

721
01:14:33,753 --> 01:14:36,693
Is that the real queen girl, you say?

722
01:14:36,793 --> 01:14:38,829
Damn him.

723
01:14:38,929 --> 01:14:43,072
Stewart knew all the time.

724
01:14:43,172 --> 01:14:46,078
Mastin, don't you think he's damnable?

725
01:14:46,178 --> 01:14:48,684
Don't you think he should be cashiered?

726
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:51,155
No, it's of no matter now.

727
01:14:51,255 --> 01:14:54,324
It matters to me, dear.

728
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:59,271
I'll wager he saw it as a humane act.

729
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:05,561
An empire is not made
on humane act, sir. Damn!

730
01:15:05,661 --> 01:15:08,557
- Damn him!
- You'll have to get used to it, Egerton.

731
01:15:08,657 --> 01:15:12,197
I fear Captain Stewart
is the voice of the future.

732
01:15:12,297 --> 01:15:14,321
Not mine.

733
01:15:15,703 --> 01:15:20,213
He's a threat to all the company
stands to gain. All England stands to gain.

734
01:15:20,313 --> 01:15:24,294
- There is the Roman solution.
- What?

735
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:29,464
In battle how many men ever make it back
from leading the advance guard.

736
01:15:29,565 --> 01:15:32,041
No one from His Majesty's point of view

737
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:35,510
is fitter to lead the advance
guard than Stewart.

738
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:41,721
And no one from your point of view
is fitter to not come back. Voila.

739
01:15:45,663 --> 01:15:48,412
Clara, Clara!

740
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:52,377
How could you do it?

741
01:15:52,477 --> 01:15:55,651
How could you? You love him.
You love James.

742
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,588
Eves dropping again.

743
01:15:57,688 --> 01:16:01,295
Yes, I heard everything.

744
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:04,836
- I know what you've done.
- And have you enjoyed being enlightened?

745
01:16:05,536 --> 01:16:09,544
- You're snake.
- How dare you!

746
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:12,925
You who have money and youth.
I have nothing.

747
01:16:13,025 --> 01:16:17,865
Now I have something and it's nothing
to be proud of. But I will settle for it.

748
01:16:19,364 --> 01:16:21,468
What about all those things
you said to me about loving

749
01:16:21,569 --> 01:16:24,384
and counting ourselves lucky.
Doesn't that mean anything?

750
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:27,665
Love has many faces
and one of them is jealousy.

751
01:16:27,765 --> 01:16:30,153
And you, you keep telling me
to act and I have.

752
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:33,660
And there's something
that I've always wanted to do.

753
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,031
I am not your servant.

754
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:42,212
That is the end of lessons for today.

755
01:16:42,544 --> 01:16:44,521
And don't think
that you can get rid of me

756
01:16:44,622 --> 01:16:48,757
because I'm coming to America with you
and your father. It's all agreed.

757
01:16:48,857 --> 01:16:51,933
When we set off, I'll be your governess
and by the time we arrive,

758
01:16:52,033 --> 01:16:54,557
your step mother...

759
01:16:56,104 --> 01:16:58,644
You've driven out yourself, Raoji.

760
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:01,616
Now the British declared war on us.

761
01:17:01,716 --> 01:17:05,289
Shall we allow them to do to us
what they did to Oudh?

762
01:17:05,389 --> 01:17:08,360
To Bengal, to Madras? No!

763
01:17:09,364 --> 01:17:11,464
Let us end their ambitions.

764
01:17:11,565 --> 01:17:14,876
Let us send them home back
to their little island.

765
01:17:14,976 --> 01:17:18,140
They shall not rule us.

766
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:22,020
May the Gods bless our queen.

767
01:17:22,824 --> 01:17:24,427
Let them hear...

768
01:17:24,527 --> 01:17:28,546
bounce your shouts, off the clouds!

769
01:18:06,712 --> 01:18:08,996
Tell me about this Captain Stewart.

770
01:18:12,155 --> 01:18:14,415
He's a leader of men.

771
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:17,859
He inspires love in our people.

772
01:18:19,203 --> 01:18:21,976
Some people say so, father.

773
01:18:22,076 --> 01:18:25,815
Then it will benefit us
to arrange his death.

774
01:18:36,805 --> 01:18:39,370
Copy her writing and her signature.

775
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:43,185
In this Stewart is a good man.
I take no delight in doing this.

776
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:46,726
But my father fought the British and he
said "it's easier to wrestle the python

777
01:18:46,826 --> 01:18:48,864
after you have chopped it's head off."

778
01:18:49,464 --> 01:18:51,766
Let's bait the trap.

779
01:19:20,425 --> 01:19:23,065
My father has given me a duty.

780
01:19:23,365 --> 01:19:26,291
To harass the English advance.

781
01:19:28,508 --> 01:19:32,350
Udaji, I've done a terrible thing.

782
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:35,657
I didn't tell the Englishman
of the prophecy.

783
01:19:35,757 --> 01:19:37,990
So, what the old man said
has come to pass.

784
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,865
I know.

785
01:19:42,837 --> 01:19:45,209
I'm sorry.

786
01:19:45,309 --> 01:19:48,616
They're gonna try
and use me to harm him.

787
01:19:48,716 --> 01:19:51,786
And he won't be warned.

788
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,869
So, what will you do?

789
01:19:56,632 --> 01:19:58,671
Refuse.

790
01:19:59,804 --> 01:20:03,479
- You would betray your own people?
- No.

791
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:07,351
Can't you see, I'm bad luck.

792
01:20:08,655 --> 01:20:12,263
Sometimes you have to see
beyond ourselves, Taluja.

793
01:20:12,964 --> 01:20:15,500
We all make sacrifices.

794
01:20:19,811 --> 01:20:22,684
I once told you, "life was simple."

795
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,522
I was wrong.

796
01:20:29,564 --> 01:20:32,635
May the Goddess hold you to her.

797
01:20:44,627 --> 01:20:45,975
James, forgive me.

798
01:20:47,499 --> 01:20:50,439
I would never let them harm you.

799
01:20:50,539 --> 01:20:52,500
Never.

800
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,136
Everything we call reality
is composed of tiny particles of energy.

801
01:22:12,236 --> 01:22:14,233
Now when 2 particles meet,

802
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:18,315
one will spin clockwise and the other
will spin counter clockwise.

803
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:21,555
And if you separate those two particles

804
01:22:21,655 --> 01:22:26,247
to the obsidian of the universe
to the obsidian of time.

805
01:22:26,799 --> 01:22:31,976
And then alter the spin of one.
The spin of the other will also alter.

806
01:22:32,076 --> 01:22:34,180
Instantaneously.

807
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:37,318
Communication across space and time.

808
01:22:47,038 --> 01:22:49,410
- Have you got everything?
- You ready?

809
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:50,657
Let's go.

810
01:23:07,145 --> 01:23:09,977
Through space and time.

811
01:23:47,358 --> 01:23:51,199
Oh, Shivaji, not that.

812
01:24:00,284 --> 01:24:03,823
Straighten the road at 350 yards at...

813
01:24:05,161 --> 01:24:07,330
10 degrees.

814
01:24:09,402 --> 01:24:11,223
No sign of the enemy.

815
01:24:13,243 --> 01:24:15,583
They'll be out there somewhere.

816
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,740
James sahib...

817
01:24:18,756 --> 01:24:21,328
What if the enemy finds us?

818
01:24:21,929 --> 01:24:26,278
Hartley and Egerton will join us
by nightfall. We'll be safe.

819
01:24:42,201 --> 01:24:46,174
Now let's the Gods decide.
I've done enough.

820
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:48,686
It's not the destiny of such a ring
to remain separated from it's twin, Ishtur.

821
01:25:48,786 --> 01:25:51,104
So it is said.

822
01:25:53,911 --> 01:25:56,509
Let's hope so, Desai.

823
01:27:13,203 --> 01:27:14,664
Wait.

824
01:27:15,008 --> 01:27:17,714
Oh, my God! I see it. Allie, I see it.

825
01:27:18,314 --> 01:27:21,908
I found it! I found it!

826
01:27:29,903 --> 01:27:31,407
- Colonel Egerton.
- Hartley.

827
01:27:31,507 --> 01:27:34,581
When can we move, to support
Stewart's advance guard?

828
01:27:34,681 --> 01:27:36,952
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

829
01:27:37,052 --> 01:27:39,256
Sir, we can't leave Stewart
exposed till then?

830
01:27:39,356 --> 01:27:43,830
As I say, you will wait
till rest of the army gets here.

831
01:27:44,398 --> 01:27:46,409
Tomorrow.

832
01:28:03,169 --> 01:28:05,177
Allie, you take it, okay?

833
01:28:05,277 --> 01:28:07,663
I've gotta get back to the hospital.
You know what to do do. I can't say.

834
01:28:07,763 --> 01:28:10,182
- I'll call you.
- Yeah.

835
01:29:16,215 --> 01:29:19,588
James sahib!
Please don't leave the camp.

836
01:29:26,002 --> 01:29:30,679
I arranged her escape, Ishtur.
It was necessary.

837
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:35,204
I wanted to tell you. Krishna knows...

838
01:29:35,304 --> 01:29:37,953
I don't love you any the less.

839
01:29:38,053 --> 01:29:40,092
We do what we must.

840
01:35:33,837 --> 01:35:36,310
Warn Dr. Nutting.

841
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:49,425
And the ring?

842
01:35:52,073 --> 01:35:53,878
It was just a ring.

843
01:35:53,978 --> 01:35:56,179
So it may seem.

844
01:35:56,548 --> 01:35:58,888
But it is a messenger.

845
01:35:58,988 --> 01:36:02,028
And what is its message?

846
01:36:04,999 --> 01:36:07,467
Love, Guru Dev.

847
01:36:08,608 --> 01:36:10,532
So...

848
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:13,463
do you love?

849
01:36:18,492 --> 01:36:20,859
It's too late.

850
01:36:22,066 --> 01:36:24,803
It's too late, Guru Dev.

851
01:36:26,508 --> 01:36:31,487
- How does time flow, Tulaja?
- Time flows like one.

852
01:36:32,388 --> 01:36:35,124
Like water in a pool.

853
01:36:35,426 --> 01:36:37,794
As you said.

854
01:37:15,273 --> 01:37:16,805
Mrs. Fennel,

855
01:37:16,905 --> 01:37:21,687
if you insert this card to that slot
it'll turn off the machines.

856
01:37:21,787 --> 01:37:23,812
Thank you.

857
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:32,626
Allie!

858
01:38:37,403 --> 01:38:39,374
Allie!

859
01:38:40,209 --> 01:38:42,209
Come on.

860
01:39:30,877 --> 01:39:32,952
I love you.

861
01:39:39,094 --> 01:39:41,325
I love you.

862
01:40:32,132 --> 01:40:34,488
Laura.

863
01:40:36,041 --> 01:40:37,726
Darling?

864
01:40:40,182 --> 01:40:42,451
Yes, sweetheart.

865
01:40:44,457 --> 01:40:47,567
You didn't think I'd...

866
01:40:48,904 --> 01:40:51,064
Think I'd...

867
01:40:51,972 --> 01:40:55,244
miss our anniversary, did you?

868
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:01,393
No.

869
01:41:01,493 --> 01:41:04,095
Of course not.

870
01:41:04,865 --> 01:41:07,334
Oh, thank God.

871
01:41:08,505 --> 01:41:11,346
I love you so much.

872
01:41:24,437 --> 01:41:27,604
Of such entangling,

873
01:41:27,704 --> 01:41:30,948
is our universe woven.

874
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:36,733
A hard pattern you may say,
this path of love.

875
01:41:39,066 --> 01:41:41,561
But how, child,

876
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:44,582
could it be otherwise?

877
01:41:45,305 --> 01:42:45,937
