Scott! Oh, grow up.

786
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,966
The reason we're here is that
this is far more serious

787
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,219
than a boy believing or not believing
in Santa Claus.

788
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,806
That's right, because Charlie thinks
that this whole thing actually happened.

789
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:54,102
Scott, what was the last thing
you and Charlie did

790
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:56,313
before you went to bed Christmas Eve?

791
00:46:56,397 --> 00:47:00,192
We shared a bowl of sugar,
did some shots of brown liquor,

792
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:03,111
played with my shotguns,
field dressed a cat,

793
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,156
looked for women.

794
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,575
I read him a book!

795
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,161
- What book?
- Hollywood Wives.

798
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,877
This is ridiculous.
I don't have time for this.

799
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,337
Ridiculous

800
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:25,008
or not, Scott, for Charlie,
this isn't some dream, it is real.

801
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:30,847
You need to sit down with Charlie.
Explain to him you are not Santa Claus.

CHARLIE: They're like the bears
at the North Pole, Dad.

SCOTT: Charlie, I already told you,
we did not go to the North Pole.

804
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,232
- That was a dream.
- You're in denial, Dad.

805
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,234
Denial! You don't even know
what that means.

806
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,612
Well, you are. I know what happened.

807
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,449
How do you know that? How?
You don't have any proof.

808
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,618
- Proof?
- Why can't we both

809
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,329
think of it as just a great dream
and forget about it?

810

Remember all the neat stuff inside?

811

Charlie, this is a toy.

812
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:06,258
We used to make things like this
at work, but no one bought 'em.

00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,094
Here. I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

I know who you are, Dad.

815
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,391
You'll figure it out soon enough.

816
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:19,229
There are a lot of kids that believe
in you. You can't let them down.

crème brûlée,

942
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,045
and hot fudge sundae, extra hot fudge.

943
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,175
On the side.

944
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:08,179
- Anything to drink?
- Ice-cold milk.

945
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,890
Stung by a bee, Scott?

946
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,476
A big bee.

(SPOON CLATTERING)

948
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,036
Finished?

949
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:41,379
Okay, now, remember.
This is just a storyboard.

950
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,674
But here is our

951
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,344
preliminary Total Tank TV spot.

952
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:51,389
Okay, now, we've got Santa.
He's up in the North Pole.

953
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:55,601
He's getting ready for Christmas!

954
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,729
Oh, no.

955
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:02,859
- Problem?
- It's just a little thing. The elves.

956
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:06,362
- What about the elves?
- They look so funny.

957
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:09,907
They're supposed to look funny.
They're elves.

958
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,367
SCOTT: Just my opinion.

959
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:15,621
Can't they look a little younger
with silver specks on their cheeks?

960
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,624
Can we continue here?

961
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:22,670
Okay, now this year,
Santa's not going out in a sleigh.

962
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:27,008
This time he's going Total Tank!

963
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:30,970
Wait a minute! No way! No way Santa's
going anywhere without his sleigh.

964
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,556
He would if he's trying
to sell the Total Tank.

965
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,975
Well, isn't that a pretty picture?

966
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,561
Santa rolling down the block
in a panzer.

967
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,939
Well, kids, I certainly hope
you've been good this year.

968
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,650
'Cause it looks like Santa just
took out the Pearson home.

969

- Incoming!
- WOMAN: Oh, please.

970
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,654
And another thing.
What about the reindeer?

971
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,157
Reindeer and Santa.
Santa and reindeer.

972
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,825
It's kind of a package deal.

973
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,745
- Calvin.
- You don't believe in Santa, do you?

974
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,748
Calvin, can we get back
to the presentation?

975
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,916
I'm not done yet.

976
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,628
Since we've opened this box, have any
of you tried to build the Total Tank?

977
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:06,297
It's got 10,000 parts,
and even if you do get it together,

978
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,007
it breaks 10 minutes later.

979
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:09,717
Then you got to spend more money
to buy more parts.

980
00:57:09,802 --> 00:57:12,929
- I thought that was the whole point.
- No, no, no, no.

981
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:17,517
What we got to do is develop a basic,
simple, inexpensive toy

982
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,977
that will nurture
a child's creative thinking.

983
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,855
- Calvin...
- Here, try the brown ones.

984
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:25,566
Can I see you outside a minute?

985
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,367
I don't know what's happening to you.

986
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,453
You're starting to look like
the Pillsbury Doughboy.

987
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:41,165
- You're falling apart.
- I know! I know.

988
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,167
I don't know what came over me.

989
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:47,547
Just get some help.
You should see a doctor, a shrink.

990
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:50,466
A dietitian, anything.
Just get some help.

(CHUCKLING)

993
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,367
- Okay, Scott. The time is up.
- Whew!

994
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,162
- Get over here and check your pulse.
- All right.

995
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,541
Okay? Hmm.

996
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:28,671
Ah.

997
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:31,883
Well, nuts. I...

998
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,427
Oh, no, your pulse is great.

999
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,263
I don't know, Scott.
You're as healthy as a horse.

1000
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,016
Yeah. Clydesdale.

1001
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,436
Okay, look. So, what?
You put on a little weight.

1002
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,189
A little weight?
Does this look like a little weight to you?

1003
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,192
Weight can fluctuate from year to year.

1004
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,612
Fluctuate? You make it sound like
I'm retaining water.

1005
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:57,033
I've gained 45 pounds in a week!
Pete, what's happening to me?

1006
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,702
- What's your diet like?
- Milk and cookies.

1007
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,954
- Really?
- But I don't finish all the milk.

1008
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:07,501
Well, then, there is your problem.
Just try to cut back on the sweets.

1009
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,337
Anything else?

1010
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:13,090
Yeah. How fast does hair grow?
Facial hair?

1011
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:15,092
What?

1012
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,471
I shave in the morning
and in the afternoon, I look like this.

1013
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:23,434
Well, it could be a hormonal imbalance.

1014
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,978
- That would explain the mood swings.
- Mood swings?

1015
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,231
Look at my hair. It's turning gray.

1016
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,399
It's middle age, buddy. It happens.

1017
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:34,070
And with that body,
you should be thankful you have hair.

you can dye it, and you should diet!

01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,761
you're taking this Santa thing

that this is beginning to scare me.

I mean, what was so bad about
Charlie believing in Santa?

I wrote Santa a letter
every week that year.

Maybe not every week.

a Mystery Date Game.

they make them anymore, but...

Except Mystery Date.

1115
