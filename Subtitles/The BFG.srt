2
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,316
It was the witching hour,

3
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,596
when the bogeyman comes out.

4
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,635
When people go missing.

5
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,675
Matron thinks the witching hour
arrives at midnight.

6
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,031
The girls say 1:00
or 2:00 in the morning.

7
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,630
I think it comes at 3: 00 in the morning,

8
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,189
when I'm the only one left awake.

9
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,518
Like always.

10
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,798
Like now.

11
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,016
Hat's in your eyes, mate.

12
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,536
Quiet. Quiet.

13
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,551
- It's that way!
- Shh!

14
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,199
Quiet.

15
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,236
Come on.

16
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,749
- Shh.
- Quiet.

17
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,116
Get outta the water, mate.

18
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,952
It's unclean.

19
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,075
That stuff will kill you.

20
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,875
Oi!

21
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,557
You're bladdered, the lot of you.

22
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,589
Would you clear off?

23
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,592
There are children trying to sleep.

24
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,355
Hello, little missy!

25
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,159
Don't little missy me!

26
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,233
I'll call the coppers. I will do it.

27
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,075
Watch the water! Come on!

28
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,320
Never get out of bed.

29
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,428
Never go to the window

30
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,558
and never look behind

31
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,714
the curtain.

32
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,110
Never get out of bed!
Never go to the window!

33
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,952
And never look behind the curtain.

34
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,472
There ain't no place to go

35
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,239
unless you has wings.

36
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,959
I is hungry. It's time for eats.

37
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,117
Whoa! Whoa!

38
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,752
Where am I?

39
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,193
Giant Country.

40
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,910
No such place.

41
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,918
We travelled a long, long way.

42
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,032
Yeah, it be a distance.

43
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,551
What's that? What's that?

44
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,073
Giants.

45
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,195
There are more of you?

46
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,198
Yeah, well...

47
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,791
Fleshlumpeater, Bonecruncher, Manhugger...

48
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,637
Childchewer, Meatdripper,
Gizzardgulper, Maidmasher...

49
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,193
Bloodbottler.

50
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,429
Bloodbottler?

51
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,954
Yeah! And the Butcher Boy.

52
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,878
Butcher Boy?

53
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,753
Please don't eat me.

54
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,119
Me?

55
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,149
You think because I'm a giant,
that I'm a man-gobbling cannybull?

56
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,749
Me?
Gobbling up human beans?

57
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,195
Do you mind?
This I never...

58
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,874
Then who are you?

59
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,791
What kind of a monster are you?

60
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,154
You has me wrong.

61
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,396
You snatched me.

62
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,950
Yeah, well, there you has me right.

63
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,673
Anyway, I didn't steal you very much.

64
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,830
After all, you's only a little thing.

65
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,078
Still, but I can't help thinking about

66
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,673
your poor mother and father.

67
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,954
They must be skump...

68
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,315
I don't have a mother or father.

69
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,675
You don't?

70
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,590
They... They both died when I was a baby.

71
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,398
So you is a norphan?

72
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,114
Yes. You took me from an orphanage.

73
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,269
You didn't know?

74
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,269
I didn't know that.

75
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,953
Were you happy there?

76
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,713
No, I hate it.

77
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,713
The matron who runs it is incompetent,
and she has crazy rules

78
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,995
and you get punished a lot!

79
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,358
How is you punished?

80
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,752
She locks you in a dark cellar.

81
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,319
There are rats down there.

82
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,789
The filthy old fizzwiggler.

83
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,988
The other giants,
are they nice like you're nice?

84
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,829
No, I's sorry to say,
the boys would eat you up in one dollop.

85
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,756
My 24 foot?

86
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,230
Puddlenuts in Giant Country.

87
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,356
And that's where you is,
in Giant Country now.

88
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,271
But why did you bring me here,
and why did you take me?

89
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,438
Well, I had to take you

90
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,554
'cause the first thing you'd be doing,
you'd be scuttling around

91
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,835
and yodelling the news
that you were actually seeing a giant.

92
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,439
And then, there would be a great
rumple dumpus, wouldn't there?

93
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,676
And all the human beans
would be rummaging

94
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,270
and whiffling for the giant what you saw,
and getting wildly excited.

95
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,794
And then they'd be locking me up in a cage

96
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,068
to be looked at with all the squiggling,
you know...

97
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,948
Hippodumplings, and crocadowndillies,
and jiggyraffes.

98
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,872
And then, there would a gigantous
look-see giant hunt for all of the boys.

99
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,234
I won't tell.

100
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,797
No one would listen to me anyway.

101
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,553
I'm an untrustworthy child.

102
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,958
Yes, you would.

103
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,318
No, I wouldn't.

104
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,033
Yes, you would.

105
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,269
No, I wouldn't.

106
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,356
- Yes, you would.
- No, I wouldn't!

107
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,193
You would be telling the whole wonky world

108
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,317
most likely on the telly-telly bunkum box

109
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,391
and the radio squeaker.

110
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,512
I won't tell. I wouldn't ever.

111
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,233
Please, take me home.
I'm scared. I want to go home.

112
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,032
No.

113
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,513
That's horrible.

114
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,996
You're just gonna have to be stayin' here
with me for the rest of our lives.

115
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,832
You mean, of my life.

116
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,636
For the rest of my life.

117
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,438
Hey, is you not all frigidy cold, eh?

118
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,716
In your little nightie.

119
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,111
I will run away.

120
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,957
Listen. Listen, you.

121
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,237
I is warnin' you

122
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,389
not to ever go whiffling out of this cave
without I is with you

123
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,836
or you is comin' to an ucky mucky end.

124
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,439
You can't stop me.

125
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,590
I've run away 1,000 times.

126
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,511
I have instincts.

127
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,834
Instincts?
I thought human beans was full of brains.

128
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,155
You is not very clever.

129
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,595
I can stop you.

130
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,954
Eh.

131
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,439
Those giants,

132
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,759
they would swallop you up
like a piece of frumpkin fry.

133
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,117
It's pumpkin pie, not frumpkin fry.

134
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,436
And jiggyraffes are giraffes.

135
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,030
Crocadowndillies are crocodiles,

136
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,998
and hippodumplings are hippopotamuses.

137
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,679
Well, I cannot be helpin' it
if I was sayin' things a little squiggly.

138
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,634
I cannot be right all the time.

139
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,752
Quite often, I is left instead of right.

140
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,790
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

141
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,389
Yeah.

142
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,479
Well, what I'm says and what I means

143
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,075
is sometimes two different things.

144
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,193
Hey, what is you reading?

145
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,753
Nicholas Nickleby.

146
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,836
- Ah?
- What's in those jars?

147
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,989
Dreams.

148
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,239
Dreams aren't things.

149
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,874
I don't dream, actually. I've got insomnia.

150
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,391
Is that right?

151
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,917
Dreams is actually very mysterious things.

152
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,638
All the time

153
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,154
they is searching

154
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,673
for...

155
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,671
For sleeping

156
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,319
people.

157
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,352
"With throbbing veins and burning skin

158
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,789
"eyes wild and heavy."

159
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,314
You can... You can read!

160
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,998
Yeah.

161
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,117
"Thoughts hurried and disordered

162
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,354
"he felt as though the light were rep-roach

163
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,315
"and shrunk involuntarily from the day

164
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,716
"as if he were some foul and hideous

165
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,513
"thing."

166
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,474
Help me!

167
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,599
No! Help!

168
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,390
Help me!

169
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,519
Help!

170
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,238
You did that.

171
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,191
There you has me right.

172
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,754
I told you I didn't dream

173
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,990
so it was much scarier
than it needed to be.

174
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,671
Needs must.

175
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,279
Titchy little snapperwhippers like you

176
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,638
should not be higgling around
with old sage and onions like me.

177
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,074
Giants is all murderful and cannybulls.

178
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,798
They's swallopin' up human beans
like they's sugar lumps.

179
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,990
"Beings", not "beans".

180
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,915
Yeah, well, they'd eat you either way.

181
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,556
What...
What is that green fizz?

182
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,433
Frobscottle.

183
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,270
All giants is drinking frobscottle.

184
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,555
It... It's fizzing the wrong way.

185
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,949
Eh?

186
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,435
Our bubbles go up.

187
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,350
Up? Up?

188
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,119
Upward-going bubbles gives
a filthsome belchy burp.

189
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,275
But what's wrong with
a little burp now and then?

190
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,228
It's loathsome.

191
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,273
But if the bubbles in your tummy go down

192
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,830
and come out someplace else...

193
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,952
- Yeah?
- That could have a far nastier result.

194
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,039
A whizzpopper.

195
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,237
- Whizzpopper?
- Yeah.

196
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,955
A sign of true happiness.

197
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,673
Oh, no.

198
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,472
It's glummy!

199
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,877
Whoopie!

200
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,189
Whoa!

201
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,552
Runt.

202
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,152
Is you at home, Runt?

203
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,869
No.

204
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,191
You is jabbeling.

205
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,555
Who is you jabbeling to, Runt?

206
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,750
Why is you such a chatbag in the morning?

207
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,996
Why is you not sleeping today?

208
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,833
Because you keep me awake
with your jabbeling.

209
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,878
I has a boo-boo.

210
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,036
Oh, possibly later.

211
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,674
Now, Runt!

212
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,796
Never mind, I will. Don't...

213
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,032
Right, now we just have
to fetch some water.

214
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,112
No, no, no. No water.

215
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,148
No water.

216
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,320
Hide behind something.
Hide behind there.

217
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,278
All right. Gimme it.

218
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,794
Gimme it. Give it here.

219
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,313
Does you have a new little petty-poo?

220
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,875
No.

221
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,117
I smells bean, Runt. I finds him...

222
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,156
- Hold still.
- ...I eats him up.

223
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,834
You is barking up the wrong dog.

224
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,956
There ain't no bean here.

225
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,152
I is hungry.

226
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,198
Hey, yeah.
Why don't you have that snozzcumber?

227
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,439
Oh, that is a scrumptious snozzcumber.
It's fresh.

228
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,590
You lives on some rotten garbage, Runt.

229
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,875
Don't be like that.

230
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,269
- Have you never tried that, Fleshlumpeater?
- No, never.

231
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,514
I'll tell you, I's guzzling that wonderveg
gleefully, night and day.

232
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,040
Well, that's what's wrong with you.

233
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,917
The outside is horrigust.

234
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,916
But the inside is smelling something...

235
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,673
...sweetly familiar.

236
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,155
Yeah! Go on! Go on, boy.

237
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,749
Get your lips around that. That is lovely.

238
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,592
- Wait! Wait!
- Huh?

239
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,236
You hates vegetables! You eats only beans!

240
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,837
I hate vegeterribles.

241
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,798
I eats only beans.

242
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,633
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

243
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,789
Yeah!

244
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,275
Yeah.

245
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,199
That's what I said.

246
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,638
That's what I is sayin'. I said it.

247
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,114
I hates, ugh, fruits and vegeterribles.

248
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,349
And water!

249
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,150
And water.

250
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,913
And water.

251
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,153
I'm taking this.

252
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,919
You.

253
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,275
You is an insult to giant people.

254
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,909
Cheers.

255
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,359
Too hot! Too hot! Too hot!

256
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,879
Too hot!

257
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,079
And something to wear?

258
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,914
What?

259
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,633
Where'd you get that jacket?

260
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,197
Um, in your scraps. It's nice.

261
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,788
Is, um, something the matter?

262
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,669
No, it's just...

263
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,795
Never mind.

264
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,439
Where are you going?

265
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,832
Uh, to work.

266
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,359
What do you do for work?

267
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,513
Oh, now you's asking me to tell you
whopsie big secrets!

268
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,919
I... I won't tell a soul.

269
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,759
How could I anyway?

270
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,791
I'm stuck here for the rest of my life.

271
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,271
I catch dreams.

272
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,079
I want to come!

273
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,479
Yeah, I bet you...

274
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,831
No, you is staying here.

275
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,519
No, I'm not!

276
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,636
Yes, you are. You is human bean

277
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,309
and human bean is like
strawbunkles and cream

278
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,437

so you gonna stay.

279
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,790
You've a nice safe place right here.

280
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,273
Not possible.

281
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,432
I goes to catch dreams, same as every day.

282
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,717
I goes alone. I's a feature of habit.

283
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,194
But you'll be leaving me here with them.

284
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,158
They will eat me.

285
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,952
They is sounding asleep.

286
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,034
I is going dream catching.

287
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,157
I is going alone.

288
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,676
You be snug as a bug up there.

289
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,273
Oh, my.

290
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,715
You can't have secrets from me.

291
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,233
It's too late for that.

292
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,912
You must take me.

293
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,598
No.

294
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,678
We can't have secrets. I'll tell you mine.

295
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,518
I sneak around at night too.

296
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,909
And I steal sometimes. And I lie.

297
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,197
So... So I'm lonely most of the time.

298
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,875
I've never had a best friend.
Sounds like you, I'll bet.

299
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,871
We... We gets over it.

300
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,468
And we... We gets on with it.

301
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,351
Fleshhead, he'll come and eat me.

302
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,313
My blood will be on your hands.

303
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,116
Everything about you goes against
all my better judgementals, girl.

304
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,111
Well, I'm right about this one.

305
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,112
I promise I am.

306
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,319

So, hold your breaths, cross your figglers,

309
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,556
We have to go right past

310
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,956

Where is you galloping off to
in the daytime, Runt?

314
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,395
You know I was going off to my work.

315
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,136
Well, you could be seen by snoopers

316
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,720
- and bring a giant hunt!
- Oh, no, no...

317
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,229
And we is not wanting a giant hunt, is we?

318
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,914
Now, let me down, Fleshlumpeater.

319
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,672
Let the boys sleep in the day.

Frolic.

323

Yeah, we might as well frolic.

324
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,675

- Frolic.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, frolic. Yeah, yeah.

327
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,439
Don't just take it.

328
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,272
Do something.

329
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,831
Gizzardgulper, go long.

330
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,670
Oh! Oh!

331
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,753
Why you not hunt with us, Runt?

332
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,068
Ooh!

333
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,435
Hey.

334
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,874
Whoa!

335
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,159
Oh...

336
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,798
Look at the puffers.

337
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,592
Rain be coming.

338
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,998
Huh? Huh?

339
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,472
Bean.

340
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,197
Now...

341
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,314
You...
You shouldn't let them treat you like that.

342
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,628
Nobody should.

343
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,954
I lives with nine bean-eating giants.

344
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,631
They takes, so I gives back.
I blows my dreams about.

345
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,478
Well, that's as good as I can do.

346
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,390
I do something, eh?

347
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,951
I do something.

348
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,078
We is here, at last.

349
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,989
You is in Dream Country now, missy.

350
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,916
I shared you a secret.

351
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,957
Look at all the stars.

352
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,432
Oh, yeah.

353
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,710
Often enough, on a clear night
I is hearing faraway music

354
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,195
coming from those stars in the sky.

355
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,392
- You do? What else?
- Well...

356
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,480
I is hearing the tiny little ants
chittering to each other

357
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,391
as they skiddle about in the soil.

358
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,316
Cattlepiddlers though,
they is the worst chatbags.

359
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,115
All the time, they is arguing about
who will be the most pretty butteryflies.

360
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,110
Go on, please.

361
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,718
I hear the footsteps of a lady bird
as she walks across a leaf.

362
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,075
But the funniest...

363
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,516
The funniest old stories I's heard from
the plants and the trees themselves.

364
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,914
Yeah.

365
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,160
They is living and growing,
laughing, chittering, just like you and me.

366
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,478
Come on, down you go.

367
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,559
Yeah.

368
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,276
I is hearing all the wondrous
and all the terrible...

369
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,033
Terrible, terrible things.

370
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,439
All the secret whisperings of the world.

371
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,750
Really?

372
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,280
You think I's swizzfiggling you, don't you?

373
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,993
No.

374
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,039
It's just all rather hard to believe.

375
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,714
At one point, someone...

376
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,599
Someone called me the...

377
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,995
The Big Friendly Giant.

378
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,031
What shall I call you, gal?

379
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,078
My name is Sophie.

380
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,916
Well, jump, Sophie.

381
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,791
This be where all my dreams is beginning.

382
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,472
Oh, my...

383
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,994
As a dream comes whiffling by
it's so silvery soft,

384
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,231
it was making like a tiny little buzzing,
humming sound, like music.

385
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,118
Bogswinkles!

386
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,190
It's a phizzwizard!

387
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,955
I don't be seeing many of them any more.

388
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,071
It's behind you on your elbow!

389
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,998
No, not that elbow! The other one!

390
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,793
Now it's on your foot!

391
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,953
The other foot!

392
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,113
It's on your bottom!

393
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,759
I gots it.

394
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,472
Seems to know you, gal.

395
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,589
Look.

396
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,352
It is a golden phizzwizard.

397
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,991
I wish I could hear it.

398
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,269
Here.

399
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,159
It be's very soft.

400
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,555
Do you actually hear what these dreams say?

401
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,959
Yeah, I do.

402
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,077
Well, this one sounds like you.

403
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,470
Hello, beautiful dream.

404
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,035
It...

405
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,319
Look.

406
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,198
Go on, make yourself useful,
my little frogglefrump.

407
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,429
I...

408
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,511
- I couldn't.
- Yeah, you could.

409
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,353
Use your hands,
your titchy little figglers.

410
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,949
Oh.

411
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,433
Ah! I got one!

412
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,112
Let it go, Sophie.

413
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,272
Give it here. Give it to me.

414
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,192
Give it to me.

415
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,992
Go, give it here.

416
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,998
Oh, mince my maggots.

417
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,359
I think this be a very, very bad dream.

418
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,155
There are bad dreams here, too?

419
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,835
It be a trogglehumper.

420
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,517
What are you going to do with it?

421
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,235
I locks them up, you wicked beastie, you.

422
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,231
What does the bad dream say?

423
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,559
It says...

424
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,157
"Look at what you has done
and there be no forgiveness."

425
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,038
Where are you?

426
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,158
I can't see you.

427
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,398
Big Friendly Giant!

428
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,198
Big Friendly Giant, I'm going to call you

429
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,473
BFG.

430
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,915
You calls me what you likes.

431
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,514
Where are you going next?

432
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,953
Dream-blowing.

433
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,110
It be as good as I can do.

434
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,913
Why here?

435
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,840
Because I hears a little heart.

436
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,476
What be your pleasure, missy?

437
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,272
Make them all happy.

438
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,794
BFG, did your mother or father
teach you about dreams?

439
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,471
Giants don't have mothers or fathers.

440
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,798
Never?

441
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,314
How old are you?

442
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,997
Oh, I's as old as the Earth, I suppose.

443
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,355
I is getting a little bit crumply

444
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,476
but us giants is mostly just
going on and on, and on...

445
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,915
Like whiffsy time-twiddlers.

446
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,472
BFG...

447
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,877
...did you hear
my heart at the orphanage?

448
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,194
Yeah, I hears it right now.

449
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,310
What does the dream say?

450
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,555
Well...

451
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,911
The boy, he's dreaming that the tellyphony

452
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,616
is ringing in his house.

453
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,995
His da, he answers it and he says,

454
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,958
"Yes, this is Mr Goulash speaking."

455
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,115
And then, he's gasping
like he has a lobster stuck in his throat.

456
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,879
And he's saying, "Who? What?
Yes, sir, I understand.

457
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,398
"But, surely, sir, it is me you wish
to be speaking to, not my little boy."

458
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,239
And then, his face turns white
and his eyes pop out of his head

459
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,912
and he says, "Yes, sir. He is here, sir.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir."

460
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,315
And he hands the phone to the boy.

461
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,679
"Is you knowing the President
of the United States?" he asks.

462
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,239
"No," says the boy.

463
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,754
"But I suspect he's hearing about me."

464
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,958
And then he takes the phone, the boy,
and he...

465
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,959
He's having a long chittery chat
on the phone with the President.

466
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,352
"Well, let me take care of it,
Mr President.

467
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,919
"No, no. No, no, no.

468
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,430
"You'll bungle it up, sir,
if you do it all your way."

469
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,800
And his dad...

470
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,035
...his eyes is
googling out of his head.

471
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,430
And then his ma, she comes into the room.

472
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,193
And his dad, he tells her. And then

473
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,836
so on, and so on, and so on.

474
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,515
Dreams are so quick.

475
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,314
Yeah, on the outside.

476
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,110
They's long on the inside.

477
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,673
Shh... Shh...

478
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,073
What?

479
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,230
I hears lament.

480
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,598
Somebody's silkies is
crying for their darling.

481
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,633
Look!

482
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,958
Monsters.

483
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,319
We have to stop them.

484
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,519
You can't keep living like this, BFG.

485
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,477
BFG, what did you do with my blanket?

486
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,596
I thought you had it there.

487
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,719
Where is it, in my other...

488
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,759
- In the cape?
- Oh, I think I dropped it in Giant Country.

489
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,191
You dropped it in Giant Country?

490
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,995
Giant Country...

491
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,878
Did I fall asleep?

492
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,434
Why are you giving me a dream?

493
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,511
Why are you giving me a dream?

494
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,074
Why are you giving me a dream?

495
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,751
You dropped your blanket.

496
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,591
So they must know you was there.

497
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,591
You's not safe with me, girl.

498
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,192
So? You is not safe with me.

499
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,954
Never mind that now.

500
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,119
There was a boy.

501
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,152
He liked to read. He taught me how to read.

502
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,277
You's wearin' his little red jacket.

503
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:10,079
I hears his lonely heart
just like I hears yours.

504
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,389
Then he seen me, like you did.

505
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,989
So I had to take him, hipswitch.

506
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,718
I could have brought him back home.

507
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,953
But then it be too late.

508
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,674
It won't be like that.

509
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,873
We'll stop the giants.

510
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,269
We'll make them go away forever.

511
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,196
Was the boy scared?

512
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,830
Yeah. In the end.

513
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,198
I'm not.

514
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,830
Brave Sophie.

515
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,999
I'm not!

516
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,714
I'm not.

517
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,239
I'm not.

518
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,719
BFG.

519
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,994
You say you can hear ants talk
and spiders spin.

520
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,557
That you can hear the stars.

521
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,437
Can you still hear me?

522
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,157
I feel you're here.

523
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,076
I know you're here.

524
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,799
BFG.

525
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,393
Jump, Sophie.

526
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,596
We need a plan...

527
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,356
We need a plan...

528
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,675
Need a plan...

529
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,559
Are you thinking up a plan?

530
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,999
I's not having the foggiest idea
in the wonky world.

531
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,956
Well, keep at it.

532
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,513
Runt!

533
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,513
Sophie. Hide.

534
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,995
Oh, Runty,
is you at home?

535
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,232
Quick, quick, quick!

536
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,590
I has a boo-boo.

537
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,519
Well, you's a big boy.

538
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,673
You take care of your
boo-boos yourself now.

539
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,194
Oh, I will.

540
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,634
Oh, he will!

541
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,711
You has a bean.

542
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,434
Right. Out!

543
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,256
Let's get on with it.

544
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,376
Let's get on with it.

545
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,356
- Time to hunt.
- Time to hunt.

546
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,434
Skitter scatter, boys.

547
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,551
Find me the chiddler.

548
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,194
No, no, no.

549
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,958
No, no. Don't! No!

550
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,479
No, don't!

551
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,709
This be my work. This be my work, boys!

552
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,794
Look at me!

553
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,438
Once, us giants, we be gentries.

554
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,314
Those days are over.

555
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,234
Where is the delicious little chatbag?

556
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,517
Oh!

557
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,238
Right! Out, all of you!

558
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,480
Toot toot.

559
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,073
Whoa!

560
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,871
Oh.

561
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,639
He find the last one.

562
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,674
I finds this one.

563
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,118
This be my home.

564
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,949
Ow, hot! Hot!

565
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,315
You don't come in here any more!

566
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,431
Go on, get out!

567
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,318
Cursed you be, Runt.

568
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,435
Get out!

569
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,596
This be my home!

570
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,309
You...

571
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,835
You is insult to giants.

572
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,114
Ow!

573
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,116
Well, there be more dreams
disappeared into a thick ear.

574
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,392
Into thin air.

575
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,118
Words.

576
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,870
They's all such a twitch-tickling problem
to me all my life.

577
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,110
I knows exactly what words I want to say

578
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,434
but somehow or other

579
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,875
they all comes out squiff-squiddled 'round.

580
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,435
Don't worry. That happens to everyone.

581
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,874
Not like it happens to me.

582
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,798
I speak in the most terrible wigglish.

583
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,509
Well, uh, I think you speak beautifully.

584
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,792
You do?

585
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,799
You really do?

586
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,077
Mmm-hmm. Simply beautifully.

587
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,432
Oh, that...

588
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:23,392
Oh, that is the nicest present that
anybody's ever given me in my entire life.

589
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,199
BFG...

590
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,191
How whoopsey-splunkers.

591
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,954
BFG.

592
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,553
How absolutely...

593
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,316
What's the word? Squiffling.

594
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,075
- BFG.
- I is all of a stutter.

595
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,752
BFG!

596
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,033
Yeah, yeah?

597
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,675
I have a plan.

598
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,193
A plan?

599
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,679
We are going to the Queen.

600
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,352
We really, really need her help.

601
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,271
We can be there by dawn.

602
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,433
Right.

603
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:08,072
You be giving your Queeny
a frightsome curd-bloodling trogglehumper.

604
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,313
Needs must. Scary as you can make it.

605
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,512
Oh, chiddlers.

606
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:30,751
The Queen will dream that giants,
all nine of them, are in England.

607
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,278
And they are eating little children.

608
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,269
And be sure to put some army in it.

609
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,676
Be sure you add a little of me.

610
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,828
Right.

611
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,079
Did you add yourself?

612
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,518
The Queen will dream that a little girl
is sitting on her windowsill.

613
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,396
Then, she wakes up and I am there.

614
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,874
We are there.

615
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,037
Uh, then what happens?

616
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,872
Well, then a Big Friendly
Giant steps forward

617
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,833
and bows and says,

618
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,276
"Your Majesty, I am your humble servant."

619
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,760
You mean she actually sees me?

620
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,038
No. Not in a month of Mondays, girl.

621
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,915
Huh?

622
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,394
BFG, stop!
You are going to knock me off.

623
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,832
Just trying to listen to the different
breathing of manly bean and lady bean.

624
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,035
No.

625
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,359
No, no. No, no it's not...

626
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,795
It's horrible. Don't. Stop them.

627
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,318
Make them stop. Make 'em stop!

628
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,791
Giants? Giants.

629
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,633
Horrible.

630
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,553
Man... Man-eating giants, no.

631
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,319
No, no, stop. No! No, no, no!

632
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,549
No!

633
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,279
Your Majesty.

634
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,595
What is it?

635
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,432
Oh, Mary.

636
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,111
I had the most horrible dream.

637
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,958
Oh.

638
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,436
Well, only a dream, ma'am, hmm?

639
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,793
Let me get your tea.

640
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,875
I dreamt that girls and boys

641
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,713
were being snatched out of their beds
in boarding schools

642
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,668
and were being eaten
by the most ghastly giants.

643
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,757
There was so many of them.

644
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,353
There was the...

645
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,953
The Fleshlumpeater

646
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,071
and the Gizzardgulper

647
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,230
and the Meatdripper.

648
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,231
And the, uh...

649
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,679
Butcher Boy?

650
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,388
Butcher Boy.

651
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,113
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Oh!

652
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,795
The giants put their hands
in through the windows

653
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,474
and pluck the children
out with their fingers.

654
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,836
It was so bloody, so vivid, so real.

655
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,475
So real, Mary.

656
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,875
The children just disappeared.

657
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,394
Oh, my.

658
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,029
Uh...

659
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,320
What's the matter, dear?
You're white as a sheet.

660
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,394
- Sit down, Mary. Sit.
- Yes.

661
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,556
You're trembling. What is it?

662
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:41,999
Well, it's just, uh, so odd, ma'am.

663
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,433
So very odd.

664
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,913
You haven't seen the papers?

665
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,194
No, I haven't seen them yet.

666
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,032
Well, here. Look.

667
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,871
It's the very dream you had.

668
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,990
Children have disappeared in the night.

669
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,111
Gone. Taken.

670
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,591
But, not by giants.

671
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,672
Well, no, it couldn't be could it, ma'am?

672
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,872
Draw the curtains.

673
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,193
Yes, ma'am.

674
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:28,909
Oh!

675
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,790
I don't believe it.

676
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,877
There's a small girl
standing on the window sill.

677
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,591
Is there not, Mr Tibbs?

678
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,917
There is indeed, ma'am.

679
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,800
She is standing right there, ma'am.

680
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,878
You didn't dream it.

681
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,232
But I did dream it.

682
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,836
How in the world did you get there?

683
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,416
- Well...
- Let me take care of this, ma'am.

684
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,680
- Here. Come down. Come with me.
- No, no, don't do that.

685
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,074
A giant put you there.

686
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,110
Yes, he did, ma'am.

687
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,998
He's waiting in the garden now.

688
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,508
Is he?

689
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,868
Is he?

690
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,153
He's my best friend.

691
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,719
He made your dream.

692
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,672
- Did he?
- Did he?

693
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,193
Did he?

694
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,231
Queen's garden, rear window, please.

695
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:34,438
Why have you and your giant come to see me?

696
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,592
I... I think you would
remember that, Your Majesty,

697
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,597
if the mixing went well.

698
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,312
Yes, I remember.

699
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,635
You have a plan. You need me.

700
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,149
Yes, we do. Should we call for him now?

701
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,269
I suppose we should.

702
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,593
You promise you won't hurt him, ma'am?

703
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,911
Rear garden, rear garden, please.

704
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,079
I'm ready.

705
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,073
BFG!

706
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:25,637
BFG, the Queen would
really like to meet you.

707
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,433
You won't put him in the bunkumhouse?

708
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:44,151
Come down from there, child.

709
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,376
Mary, take her downstairs
and get her some breakfast.

710
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,896
- Mr Tibbs, find out where she comes from.
- Come on, dear. Come on.

711
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,878
No! No! No, he's just afraid.

712
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,550
He's never done anything like this
in his whole life before.

713
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,192
BFG, be brave!

714
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,108
You promised you wouldn't hurt him.

715
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,035
Mr Tibbs, tell the guards to stand down.

716
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,759
Mr Tibbs?

717
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,034
Stand down, gentlemen, please. Stand down.

718
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,959
Dear, come here.

719
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,235
Your Majesty, I am your humble servant.

720
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:00,833
Your Majester, I is your humbug servant.

721
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,237
I'm so pleased to make your acquaintance.

722
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:19,389
Oh, Majester. Oh, Monacher.

723
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,750
Oh, ruler of

724
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,632
straight lines.

725
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,353
I's come, with my little friend Sophie

726
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,553
to give you a...

727
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,589
Uh...

728
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,349
To give me what?

729
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,315
A sistance.

730
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,599
Thank you.

731
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:52,109
I'm sure you have,
but not in my dressing-gown.

732
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,836
Giants, Boris. Man-eating giants.

733
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,592
Have people been disappearing?

734
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,828
Ha!

735
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,150
We have verifiable intelligence.

736
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,231
We might need air clearance.
I'll get back to you.

737
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,794
Nancy, is Ronnie there?

738
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,558
Well, wake him.

739
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,075
Her Majesty the Queen.

740
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,989
This way, sir. Just follow me.

741
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,638
Follow me.

742
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:06,994
That's it, sir.

743
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,035
Slow ahead. Careful. Slow ahead.

744
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,073
And full stop.

745
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,350
To port side, sir. Oh!

746
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,237
Careful of the antiques, sir.

747
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,671
And up. Up.

748
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,108
Careful, up, up. That's it.

749
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,312
Hard to port.

750
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,960
And slow ahead.

751
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,559
Steady...

752
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,075
Yes, sir.

753
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,628
Oh!

754
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,956
Bogswinkles! What was that?

755
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,279
That was Louis Quatorze.

756
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,270
I'm so, so sorry, Your Majesty.

757
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,595
He's never really been in a house before.

758
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,392
Your cape, sir.

759
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:03,428
What a whoppsy, spliffling room we is in.

760
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,712
Your valise, sir.

761
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,599
Your Majesty.

762
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,034
This... This room is so gigantous

763
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,795
I's needed bicirculers and telescoops
to see what's going on at either end.

764
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,033
Does he always talk like that?

765
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,516
Yes, Your Majesty.

766
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,232
He's never had schooling.

767
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,594
Ah.

768
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,279
Ah.

769
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,954
Sir.

770
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,349
Please, BFG. Start.

771
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,268
Oh.

772
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,391
There's only one word for that, Majester.

773
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,197
Scrumdiddlyumptious.

774
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,470
Oh, that is glummy.

775
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,790
Goodbye snozzcumber.

776
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,392
What's snozzcumber?

777
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:01,230
It's this horrible stinky vegetable,
and I'm afraid it's all he has to eat.

778
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,550
Doesn't seem to have
stunted his growth at all.

779
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:09,789
Mmm...

780
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,751
Pour BFG his coffee, please.

781
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,715
What's that? What's that black stuff?

782
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,557
What is that?

783
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,679
Where'd you get all that foam?

784
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,952
He's magnificent, your giant.

785
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,832
Sophie, dear, do start.

786
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,398
You must be famished.

787
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,034
It's delumptious.

788
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,149
Ah.

789
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,948
Oguflug!

790
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:43,992
Please, Majester, what is this
horrible swigpill I's drinking, Majester?

791
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,313
Would he prefer tea?

792
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,709
He would prefer frobscottle.

793
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,079
- Frobscottle?
- Yeah.

794
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,232
A little gift for Your Majester.

795
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,714
Delunctious, fizzy, frobscottle.

796
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,951
It be a personable ferment.

797
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,828
How kind.

798
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:06,796
Would Your Majester be so kind
as to honour me with...

799
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,959
...a pour?

800
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,760
It's fizzing the wrong way.

801
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,038
Our bubbles go up.

802
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:22,554
Oh, yeah. We wouldn't have some glumptious,
whizzpopping music?

803
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,389
Does he like music? We have bagpipes.

804
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,956
The generals have been briefed, ma'am.

805
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,351
This is a story which beggars belief,
but we don't have the time.

806
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,391
We're on our way to Giant Country.

807
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,875
BFG will chart a course for you.

808
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,590
Generals, BFG.

809
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:03,559
In 10 hours, the giants will
once again be on the hunt.

810
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,395
And I intend to stop them.

811
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,513
And where exactly is Giant Country, sir?

812
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,389
Exunctly, well, let's see.

813
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,594
Hey.

814
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,034
There.

815
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,713
- What?
- There.

816
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,198
Gentlemen, your men will follow the BFG.

817
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,195
I have promised him you will go
only once to Giant Country.

818
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,749
You not be finding it a second time.

819
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,431
Just look at those bubbles.

820
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,599
I believe in the BFG.

821
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,159
The BFG!

822
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,748
To the BFG.

823
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,392
Marvellous bubbles.

824
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,832
To Giant Country.

825
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,718
We will hold here.

826
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,350
BFG, I was asking
if you had a plan.

827
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,751
BFG. Do you have a plan?

828
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,190
BFG! Do you have a plan?

829
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,554
The trogglehumper I caught,
you're giving it to the giants?

830
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:35,558
Yeah, I was giving the boys
this most horrigust dream of despair.

831
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:40,476
If the dream does its job, they wakes
trapped in flush bunking remorse.

832
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:44,115
And if those wopsy bellypoppers out there
does their job,

833
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,874
then I think we stands a chance.

834
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,755
"Look at what you has done,
and there be no forgiveness."

835
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:56,277
Needs must. Now, stand back, girl.

836
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,358
We's brought the hunt to Giant Country.

837
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,595
Uh...

838
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,796
What is Sophie's dream?

839
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,878
Your golden phizzwizard.

840
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,155
I don't see much of them any more.

841
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,234
But what does it say?

842
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,838
It tells a story of a little gal.

843
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:04,549
A little chiddler with
her whole life ahead of her.

844
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,113
With a fambly of her own.

845
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:12,269
Little chiddlers of her own, too, someday.

846
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,831
There will be great successfuls...

847
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,519
...and funnies ahead for her,

848
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:24,637
and truth to tell,
just a dribble of despair.

849
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,714
Times'll be hard, times is be soft.

850
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,399
Adventures will come and go.

851
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,439
But in the end

852
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,753
she remembers the good deeds.

853
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,358
Now, Sophie, I...

854
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,274
I know

855
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:52,040
that story be your heart's desire.

856
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,638
I knows it.

857
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,754
The dream, it came to you, didn't it?

858
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,070
It be Sophie's dream.

859
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,871
But, then I wake up.

860
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,277
Then you wakes up.

861
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,554
But not here.

862
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,835
No.

863
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:21,597
You has more dreams to catch,
my little frogglefrump.

864
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,518
But not in Giant Country.

865
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,078
But will I still have you?

866
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,110
Will you still hear me when I call for you?

867
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,552
Are you forgettin' something?

868
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,679
Are you forgettin' these?

869
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,756
It be time, BFG.

870
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,198
Now, where did I put the...

871
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,835
I left me trumpet at Her Majester's.

872
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,549
Oh, I is such a mixed-up,

873
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,510
boggled-up giant sometimes.

874
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,557
Deliver us from weasels.

875
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,958
Sophie?

876
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:35,755
Oh, no. Oh, no, Sophie.

877
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:03,518
And what does we have here?

878
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,152
You is a cannybull.

879
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,513
I is bad.

880
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:41,314
Have pity on a poor little giant.

881
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,830
You are a very bad giant.

882
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,438
I has no regrets.

883
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,670
- Runt!
- Run, Sophie! Run!

884
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,389
It's over, Fleshlumpeater.

885
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,190
It's over, boy.

886
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,032
It's time to stop now.

887
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,390
I's always hungry.

888
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,555
Huh?

889
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:18,513
Whoa!

890
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,431
Back of the LZ.

891
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,589
Roger that.

892
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,873
Come on, lads!

893
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,319
Take him away!

894
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,158
Go! Go, go!

895
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,919
Secure that side!

896
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,592
Take cover!

897
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,634
The giants were taken
far, far away

898
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:42,995
to a place you've never heard of

899
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:44,877
and a place you'll never go.

900
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:38,472
The Queen sent them off
with snozzcumber seeds.

901
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,750
It was all they would have to eat...

902
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,194
...and they were just going
to have to get used to it.

903
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,590
It's time to wake up, darling.

904
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:37,471
Morning, Sophie.

905
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,992
I had a dream last night.

906
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,155
In the dream, I was
awakened by a beautiful,

907
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:56,754
buzzing, humming noise
floating above my bed.

908
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,153
I walked to the window

909
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,995
and against the horizon
I saw his long legs leaping,

910
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,148
suitcase and trumpet in hand.

911
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:16,072
I could see all the way to Giant Country.

912
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,752
I could see the garden BFG was growing.

913
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:23,435
He had fruits and berries,
cauliflower and tomatoes.

914
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:26,678
He refused to have
Brussels sprouts, though.

915
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:30,037
But snozzcumbers were still growing
at the side of his cottage.

916
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,875
How else would he make frobscottle?

917
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:38,429
I saw the stone door,
and the crooked windows.

918
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,636
His cape was hanging by the door.

919
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:45,797
I saw the crow's nest and
his sailor boat bed.

920
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:52,114
I saw his rocking chair
and a fire burning in the fireplace

921
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,873
with a much nicer stew cooking.

922
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:01,957
I could see the scattered pages
of the book he was writing.

923
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:09,789
He was happy, and I was happy.

924
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:14,469
When I'm lonely,
which is not nearly as often as before,

925
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:18,356
I talk to him and he actually hears me.

926
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:22,835
Because BFG hears

927
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:26,396
all the secret whisperings of the world.

928
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,312
Good morni ng, BFG.

928
01:48:30,305 --> 01:49:30,165
