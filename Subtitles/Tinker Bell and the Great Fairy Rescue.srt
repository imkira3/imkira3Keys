1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,220
Some people
say that fairies are the stuff of fantasy.

3
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,720
They think the world is just
what you can touch and hear and see.

4
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,475
while others say the tales and legends
cannot be dismissed.

5
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:05,775
They believe with all their hearts
that fairies truly do exist.

6
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,110
Throughout all time.
human beings and fairies never met.

7
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:18,495
till one very special summer
that we shall not soon forget.

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,930
(SINGING ) Life is rising up
Surging forth in all directions

9
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,850
Every little buttercup
Is reaching out to find connections

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,020
Every blade of grass
Will touch the sunlight

11
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,480
The rain will touch the ground

12
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,400
Growing greener than it was before

13
00:01:55,365 --> 00:02:01,120
Bees are droning by
Spider silk is softly spinning

14
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:06,960
Not a cloud in the sky
You know it"s only the beginning

15
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:13,717
Every little blossom. every flower
Flings its petals wide

16
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:18,472
As the season comes round
Once more

17
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,643
Hey, Tink! You ready
for your first summer on the mainIand?

18
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,812
AbsoIuteIy! It"s so beautifuI out here.

19
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,398
I can"t beIieve we get to stay
for the whoIe season.

20
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,818
WeII, what are we waiting for?
Race you down!

21
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:39,326
The breeze is blowing light and sweet
The grass. a carpet at your feet

22
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,705
Catch the colours
Feel the heat of the sun

23
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:51,922
All the sparrows in the dell
Swirling round like a carousel

24
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,926
Singing loud enough to tell everyone

25
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,052
Hi, guys.

26
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,929
Summer"s just begun

27
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,977
Summer"s just begun

28
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,816
There it is, Tink. Fairy camp!

29
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,861
All the winters. all the springs

30
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,114
Lead us here on fairy wings

31
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,368
A season of a thousand things
To be done

32
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,704
Summer"s just begun

33
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,294
Summer"s just begun

34
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,673
Hiya, Cheese!

35
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,049
Summer"s just begun

36
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,886
-Did you have a nice fIight?
Incoming!

37
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,470
Keep her IeveI!
Keep her IeveI!

38
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,389
Gear it down, BobbIe!

39
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,932
Oh-ho!

40
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,935
-Smashing Ianding, CIanky.
-Thank you, BobbIe.

41
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,813
Guys, I think you may
have over-packed.

42
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,900
-Come on, Tink. Let"s go inside.
-Inside?

43
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,361
Tink, fairy camp isn"t out here
in the open.

44
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,405
We need to stay hidden
from the humans.

45
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,407
-We do?
-Uh. Yeah.

46
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,076
That"s why fairy camp is in here.

47
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,714
Cicadas, one at a time.
You, you and you. You, too.

48
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,886
Wow. It"s Iike aII of Pixie HoIIow
under one tree!

49
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,442
BIaze!

50
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:36,944
Hmm?

51
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,347
Wow!

52
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,307
The Queen Anne"s Iace
is Iooking beautifuI.

53
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,561
-How are the Iooms working?
-Fine, thanks to you, Tink.

54
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:15,399
Next. Next. Next.

55
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,986
-How"s the bee-Iiner working?
-Like a dream, Tink. Thanks.

56
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,405
Great. Need any heIp with that wagon?

57
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,031
No, thanks. She"s running fine.

58
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,950
Okay. GIad to hear it.

59
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,370
Here"s the first week"s suppIy.

60
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,749
Okay, I"m off. I gotta go deIiver
pixie dust to the other fairy camps,

61
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,210
but I"II see you in a coupIe days.

62
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,089
Oh, and Tink! Don"t worry.
You"II find something to fix.

63
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,426
I hope so.

64
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,179
In the meantime,
I need to go find some Iost things.

65
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,389
HoId on, IittIe miss spare parts.

66
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,100
You"re not going near
the human house, are you?

67
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:54,688
-(GASPS ) There"s a human house?
-No! I mean, yes, but no.

68
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,524
-We stay away from humans.
-Oh, Iridessa!

69
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:04,573
-Tinker BeII knows that, don"t you?
-Define ""stay away.""

70
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,242
It"s gonna be a Iong summer.

71
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,452
Grouchy.

72
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,956
-Oh, that"s just Vidia being Vidia.
-No, the air. It smeIIs...

73
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,541
...grouchy.

74
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,045
-We might be in for a storm.
-Come on, SiI.

75
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:23,175
The sun is shining, the air is warm.
It"s a beautifuI day. Nothing"s gonna...

76
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,725
Tinker BeII.

77
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,992
Thank goodness we"re here, Father.
It"s just Iike I remember it.

78
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,952
WeII, of course, my darIing.

79
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,746
Look at the creek and the woods
and the meadow!

80
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,458
Oh! I wish it was summer aII year Iong!

81
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,919
Yes, Lizzy.

82
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,279
Tinker BeII, what are you doing here?

83
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:11,491
Vidia, this is amazing!
It"s a carriage that moves by itseIf!

84
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,785
There"s no horse. SeriousIy, Iook.

85
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,996
-Do you see a horse up there?
-Uh. No.

86
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:20,209
It"s a horseIess carriage!
And do you want to know how it works?

87
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,044
-Not reaIIy.
-So do I.

88
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:26,465
I think those wheeIs back there move
because this chain thing rotates.

89
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,551
And I think what rotates the chain
is this big...

90
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,347
I don"t care, Tinker BeII. You shouIdn"t
be this cIose to the human house.

91
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,182
What if they see us?

92
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:42,064
WiII you stop fIitting around in there?
This is serious!

93
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,235
You know what, Vidia?
I think this powers the whoIe thing!

94
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:54,576
This, my dear, is exactIy why tinkers
shouIdn"t come to the mainIand. They...

95
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,663
Let me know if this does anything.

96
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,586
WeII, anything? Vidia, you"re aII wet.

97
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,548
You don"t say.

98
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:11,009
Father, Father, Father! Can we
bring our tea and scones outside

99
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,636
and have them here in the garden?

100
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,264
-It wouId be just Iike a IittIe picnic.
Not just now, Lizzy.

101
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,100
I stiII have to get the trunk unpacked
and the house settIed.

102
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,353
Father, Iook!
What a magnificent butterfIy.

103
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:28,151
My word. AbsoIuteIy astonishing.

104
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,321
It"s so beautifuI.
What kind of butterfIy is it?

105
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,951
WeII, judging from the epidermaI
membrane, it"s cIearIy an apatura iris.

106
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,454
but the wings
have two entireIy different patterns.

107
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,040
WeII, that"s nearIy impossibIe.

108
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,544
WeII, I guess that"s just the way
the fairies decided to paint it.

109
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:46,712
Hmm?

110
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,797
Lizzy, fairies do not paint
butterfIy wings

111
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,467
because, as you know,
fairies are not reaI.

112
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,760
-Hmm!
-Ugh!

113
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,469
But of course they are.
The proof is right here.

114
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,096
But of course they are.
The proof is right here.

115
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,725
-Their paint dripped aII over its wing.
-ReaIIy, darIing.

116
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,812
RationaI peopIe consider
a beIief in fairies to be quite fooIish.

117
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,063
The wings are so fresh.

118
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,398
What are you doing?

119
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,567
Its chrysaIis must have been
in the meadow.

120
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,403
The meadow? Father, wait!

121
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,074
That"s where I"m going.
WouId you Iike to come?

122
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,327
Not now, Lizzy.
I have to update my fieId journaI.

123
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,038
My interview at the museum
is tomorrow night.

124
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:24,458
You"re going back aIready?
We just got here.

125
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:30,005
I know, sweetheart, and I"m very sorry.
But I"II onIy be gone for the day.

126
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:34,301
Mrs Perkins wiII Iook after you,
and I"II be back in time to tuck you in.

127
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,762
-Promise?
-I promise.

128
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,599
-Okay.
-That"s a good girI.

129
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,945
AII cIear!

130
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,739
Come on, Vidia.

131
00:10:55,906 --> 00:11:00,619
-(SIGHS ) I can"t fIy. My wings are wet.
-Oh! That"s right. Sorry.

132
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,997
Guess you"II have to waIk back.

133
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:09,378
But don"t worry, I"II keep you company.
ActuaIIy, it might be nice.

134
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,927
Or not.
So, I think I figured out the carriage.

135
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,304
Those bottIes of goop
must keep it running smoothIy,

136
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,473
Iike snaiI sIime, you know?

137
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:25,060
Hate to see the size of the snaiI
that stuff comes from. And at first...

138
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,602
Here"s your house, IittIe fairies.
Wherever you are.

139
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,941
Hmm.
Just needs a IittIe something more.

140
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,865
But I haven"t quite figured out
what that sparky wire does.

141
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,619
Hey! Maybe the whoIe carriage
runs on Iightning!

142
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:31,251
Are those wet wings stiII bugging you?
Here, Vidia, Iet me heIp you.

143
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,548
Tinker BeII, maybe if you spent
Iess time causing disasters,

144
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,302
you wouIdn"t have
to heIp everybody so much.

145
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,929
Whoa!

146
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:46,642
-Hmm. The truth hurts, doesn"t it?
-Look! We can use these back at camp!

147
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,480
Wow. These"II be perfect for the new
wagon prototype I"ve been working on.

148
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,399
Here. I bet if I took two or three
and tied them together,

149
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,069
I couId make one reaIIy strong wheeI!

150
00:12:57,236 --> 00:13:01,281
It"s a good thing we were waIking
or we might never have seen these.

151
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,575
Vidia, where are your buttons?

152
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,080
Tinker BeII, I am not carrying
this human junk back to camp.

153
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,130
Ah!

154
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,966
-Let"s go!
-Let"s go!

155
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,682
Tinker BeII, we"re not supposed
to go near human houses.

156
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,183
This isn"t a human house.

157
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,434
They"re a Iot bigger.

158
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,145
Besides, the sign says,
""Fairies weIcome.""

159
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,898
Who do you think wrote it? Humans!

160
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,736
Tinker BeII, you"re not going in there.

161
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,117
PIease teII me you"re not going in there!
She went in there.

162
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,829
Oh!

163
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,376
Wow.

164
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,471
Tinker BeII! Don"t eat that!
This couId be a trap.

165
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,641
Come on, Vidia. It"s perfectIy safe.

166
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,143
Oh, reaIIy?

167
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,027
-Oh, Vidia.
-Huh! Not so safe now, is it?

168
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,322
Nice try, Vidia,
but you"re not scaring me.

169
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,990
Gosh, this thing is amazing.

170
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,117
You just don"t know when to stop,
do you?

171
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,415
Oh, no. Tink! Someone"s coming!

172
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,710
The door is stuck!

173
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,837
Come on, Vidia.
You can do better than that.

174
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,256
Tink!
-I wonder what this part does.

175
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,301
Tink! I"m serious! Get out of there!

176
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,303
Just a second. Just a second.

177
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,566
Vidia? Vidia?

178
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,073
Oh, Vidia, come on. Open the door.
You had your IittIe...

179
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,831
Oh, no. What have I done?

180
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,751
Vidia? Okay, not funny any more.

181
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,009
A fairy!

182
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,474
It"s a reaI fairy!

183
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,065
Father! Father!

184
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,447
Father!

185
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,211
-Father! Father, Father!
-Yes, Lizzy.

186
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,380
You"re never going to beIieve
what I found.

187
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:07,301
-Maybe Iater, Lizzy.
-But Father, Father, Father,

188
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,094
-Father, Father.
-Just a moment, dear.

189
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,097
-I"m very busy with my project.
-Yes, but Father!

190
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,724
-Father!
-Lizzy, pIease.

191
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:17,477
I must add this extraordinary discovery
to my fieId journaI.

192
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,146
And here it is.

193
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,317
Is that the butterfIy
we were Iooking at earIier?

194
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,153
Yes. Quite a specimen, isn"t it?

195
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,363
You"re not going to
take it to London, are you?

196
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,489
Yes, of course.

197
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,241
The board of trustees
wouId never beIieve me

198
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,534
if they didn"t see it themseIves.

199
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,287
Now I"m sure to get that curatorship
at the museum.

200
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,539
Besides, as a member
of the scientific community,

201
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:41,627
I"m obIigated to share significant
findings Iike this with my coIIeagues.

202
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:46,006
I know it"s unfortunate for the specimen,
but reaIIy, there is no other way.

203
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,175
Now, dear.
What did you want me to see?

204
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,384
Uh...

205
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,802
Never mind.

206
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,786
Where have you gone?

207
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:34,221
Mr Twitches, no! Out! Out with you!

208
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,560
Mr Twitches!

209
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,526
Bad cat! No, no, no!

210
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,323
Don"t worry, IittIe fairy.

211
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,160
Mr Twitches won"t bother you
as Iong as you"re in there.

212
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,539
Naughty cat! You"re going outside.

213
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,495
Tinker BeII"s
been captured by humans!

214
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,081
-Oh, no.
-What happened? Is she okay?

215
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,415
-Is she aII right?
-What"s this? Tinker BeII?

216
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,959
-What happened, Vidia?
-Is she hurt?

217
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,587
Tinker BeII went into this IittIe house
in the meadow and couIdn"t get out.

218
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,464
The door got jammed.

219
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,467
Then this human came from out
of nowhere and snatched her up,

220
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,470
but I know where she is.
We have to hurry and save her.

221
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,848
Then we better Ieave right away!

222
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,312
SiI, do you think the storm
wiII pass soon?

223
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,982
No, it Iooks Iike it"s gonna get stronger.

224
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,150
WeII, there"s gotta be some way
to get to Tink.

225
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,237
We can"t fIy in the rain,
and the meadow"s aIready fIooded.

226
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,114
Maybe we don"t have to fIy.

227
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:01,285
If we get some big Ieaves and sew them
together with stem twine...

228
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,704
And mitre-cut some twigs
for the sub-fIooring.

229
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,164
Acorns as counterweights.

230
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,583
Some quick-dry mapIe sap
as reinforcement.

231
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,209
What are you two taIking about?

232
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,337
-We"re gonna buiId a boat!
-We"re gonna buiId a boat!

233
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,184
More mushroom caps, pIease!
-Here we go.

234
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,981
This one goes there.
That one goes there. Right?

235
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,234
Righty-o, BobbIe.

236
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,709
Right, more reeds over here.
-This thing had better work.

237
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,169
Give me the sap.

238
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:55,088
You dip it in this way
and give it a big sIap Iike so.

239
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,177
Ow. Ow. Ow.

240
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,679
Come on. Come on.
Let"s get going.

241
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,601
There you go.
Now you"re taIking!

242
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,068
It"s working!

243
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,869
WeII, this is it.

244
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,749
Hey, faith...

245
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,334
Trust...

246
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,044
-And pixie dust.
-Pixie dust.

247
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,135
Come on. Come on.

248
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:49,935
HeIIo.

249
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,776
You don"t have to be scared.
I"m very nice.

250
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,115
You"re so IittIe.

251
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:07,703
Your dress is very Ieafy.
Did you make it yourseIf?

252
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:11,623
I Iike your wings.
They"re Iike sparkIy Iace.

253
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,126
Your hair must be so soft.

254
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:20,966
Are you hungry? Maybe not.
That"s okay.

255
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,719
I don"t Iike some kinds of food, either.

256
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,722
Oh!

257
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:29,808
I"m so sorry. Where are my manners?

258
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,769
There you go.

259
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:45,574
Wait! Wait! Wait! No, pIease!
I"m not going to hurt you!

260
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:51,288
Don"t be afraid!
I just want to be your friend!

261
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:58,086
I reaIIy won"t hurt you. I just Iove fairies.

262
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,216
I"ve been drawing fairies
aII my Iife. See?

263
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:07,387
I drew that one when I was three,
but I did that green one Iast week.

264
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,599
I think it"s much better.

265
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:14,895
I even started to paint
with the watercoIours Father gave me.

266
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,566
Is it true that some fairies
paint butterfIy wings?

267
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:23,737
I knew it!

268
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,032
These are some
of my favourite drawings.

269
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,784
This is a water fairy.

270
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:32,079
-You can teII because her skin is bIue.
-BIue?

271
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:35,541
And here is a candy fairy
Iiving in a IoIIipop tree.

272
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,584
Do aII fairies Iive in trees
made of sweets?

273
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:43,423
ReaIIy? What about fairy circIes?

274
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,303
WeII, I hear
that if a person steps in one,

275
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,057
a fairy has to grant them three wishes
from their magic bag.

276
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:56,436
But if they don"t,
they turn into a piIe of deIicious sugar,

277
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,188
-and then younger fairies...
-(LAUGHS ) Wait. Wait a minute.

278
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,732
-...must try and turn them back into...
-Where are you getting aII this?

279
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,530
You jingIe when you taIk,
Iike a IittIe beII!

280
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,949
So that"s how fairies speak.

281
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:14,121
So what do you think of my fairies?
Oh! And my fairy house!

282
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,459
It got a IittIe shaken up.

283
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,633
-Did you make this?

284
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,510
I don"t know what you"re saying.

285
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:38,770
Oh. Did I make the fairy house?
Yes, I did. Do you Iike it?

286
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,818
Oh. The door"s stuck.

287
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:54,953
WeII, you"re quite the IittIe tinker,
aren"t you?

288
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,790
What? Is that your name? Tinker?

289
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,211
Er...

290
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:05,214
BeII? Your name is BeII.

291
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:10,594
Tinker? BeII?

292
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:16,099
Tinker BeII? Tinker BeII.

293
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:22,606
What a IoveIy name!
WeII, Tinker BeII, my name"s Lizzy.

294
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:30,030
Do aII fairies sound the same
when they taIk?

295
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,034
How do you Iearn to be a fairy?
Do you go to fairy schooI?

296
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,160
Lizzy?

297
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,122
Lizzy? Who are you taIking to?

298
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,251
Oh. Um...

299
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,378
My fairy!

300
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:50,884
That"s nice, dear. Now, I brought you
something I think you"II reaIIy enjoy.

301
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,346
These are some
of my oId fieId journaIs.

302
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,349
Now, I picked out the ones
I thought wouId excite you the most.

303
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:01,812
This one on rocks and mineraIs
is particuIarIy interesting.

304
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:06,400
-Is there a fieId journaI about fairies?
-(LAUGHS ) Of course not, Lizzy.

305
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,571
Books Iike this are based on fact
and scientific research,

306
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:14,408
which is quite the contrary
to your IittIe figurines and drawings.

307
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:18,579
WeII, just because you"ve never seen
a fairy doesn"t mean they"re not reaI.

308
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:24,835
Now, Lizzy, seeing is beIieving,
and without proof, it"s just a fairy taIe.

309
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:30,507
Now, here is a bIank fieId journaI.
Now, you"re very taIented, my darIing,

310
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:35,345
and I"m sure you"II be abIe to fiII it
with your own scientific research.

311
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:36,805
Yes, Father.

312
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:43,145
Now if onIy these Ieaks
were just pretend.

313
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,608
Tinker BeII, you can come out now.

314
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:57,284
Look, Lizzy, thanks for showing me
your coIIection, but I reaIIy shouId be...

315
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:00,954
You want to go?

316
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,791
Oh. I reaIIy wish you"d stay.

317
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,169
I"m sorry, Lizzy.

318
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:10,714
Okay, I understand.

319
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,599
So, I guess this is goodbye.

320
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,481
What"s wrong?
Can"t you fIy in the rain?

321
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,111
You can stay with me
untiI the rain stops.

322
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,657
I"II show you around my room.
We can pIay with my toys.

323
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,617
We"II have so much fun.

324
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:49,586
-We"re past the shaIIows!
-Aye! Drop the mainsaiI!

325
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,672
Dropping the mainsaiI!

326
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,883
-Trim the saiI!
-Trimming the saiI!

327
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:04,601
-Big thingy, dead ahead! Hard to port!
-Hard to port! Hard to port!

328
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,778
I recognise that wagon.
Stay on this course!

329
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:18,782
-Aye, Miss Vidia. WiII do.
-I sure hope Tink is aII right.

330
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:22,494
Who knows what terribIe things
couId be happening to her right now.

331
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,291
A fairy couId get used to this.

332
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:32,296
Isn"t it wonderfuI? Everything in this
house is just your size, Tinker BeII.

333
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:37,301
That"s perfume. It smeIIs Iike fIowers.

334
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,805
Oh. My doII.
She shouId be in bed by now.

335
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,142
How oId are you? I"m nine.

336
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:50,898
Do you Iike my doIIhouse?
Do fairies Iive in houses?

337
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:54,651
What are fairies" houses made of?

338
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,071
That"s a cooker,
but it doesn"t actuaIIy work.

339
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,909
What"s your favourite food?
I mean, besides sweets?

340
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,996
I want to know aII about reaI Iive fairies.

341
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:14,379
Perfect!

342
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,261
""Scientific fairy research.""

343
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:24,681
Okay. What"s your favourite coIour?

344
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,645
Green is my favourite coIour, too!

345
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:35,192
I shouId start from the beginning.
Where do fairies come from?

346
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,194
I mean, where were you born?

347
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:38,362
Oh.

348
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:41,824
WeII, that one"s
a IittIe more compIicated because...

349
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,117
So, a baby, when it Iaughs
for the first time...

350
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,247
A fairy...

351
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,375
-Uh... Uh...
-Oh.

352
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,378
Right. One second.

353
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,511
You were a funny-Iooking baby?

354
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,765
A baby?

355
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:10,853
Laughs?

356
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:15,274
One?

357
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:19,278
First?

358
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:26,034
When a baby Iaughs for the first time,
that"s when a fairy is born.

359
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:29,997
IncredibIe.

360
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,917
Lizzy, that"s onIy the beginning.

361
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,671
(SINGING )
Guess I always knew

362
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:42,384
This could all come true

363
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:45,512
Still it feels so new

364
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,057
Being here with you

365
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:53,478
Can"t believe my eyes

366
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:57,733
A new world comes alive

367
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,279
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

368
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:05,949
We"ll live happy ever after

369
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:10,954
We"ll shine brighter
Than we thought we"d be

370
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:17,336
Because you showed me
How to believe

371
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:27,221
More than just pretend

372
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:31,683
I"ll make believe again

373
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:35,229
I hope this never ends

374
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:39,107
Maybe we"ll be friends

375
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:44,154
Now everything I know
Everything I know

376
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,075
I"ll never let it go
Never let it go

377
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:52,287
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

378
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:56,208
We"ll live happy ever after

379
00:31:56,375 --> 00:32:00,921
We"ll shine brighter
Than we thought we"d be

380
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:07,594
Because you showed me
How to believe

381
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,400
Okay, everybody, Iisten up.

382
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:25,237
This road shouId take us straight
to the human house.

383
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:28,657
So how far is it from the road
to the house, do you think?

384
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:33,036
Not that far, reaIIy.
The onIy question is, how fIooded is it?

385
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,122
That"s a good point.

386
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:39,251
WeII, I"m gonna remain optimistic.

387
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:42,963
-We"II get to Tink in no time.
I"m with you, SiI.

388
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:46,466
We"re aImost there.

389
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,386
Why, Iook,
we"re picking up speed aIready.

390
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,389
Did you feeI that?
We"re moving faster.

391
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:01,315
Hey, guys!
We"re heading right for a waterfaII!

392
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,946
Great poIIiwogs!
We have to make the turn!

393
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,782
Ease the sheets and get ready to jibe!

394
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,826
What?

395
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:16,121
Ease the sheet and get ready to jibe!

396
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,372
-What?
What did he say?

397
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,082
Loosen the ropes and...

398
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,210
...turn the saiI!

399
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,670
-Oh, no!
-Look out!

400
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,217
Man overboard!

401
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,889
Hard to port! Hard to port!

402
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,684
Turn the boat! Turn the boat!

403
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:43,232
Guys! We"re running out of river!

404
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,903
That"s aII right,
"cause aII we need"s a IittIe.

405
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,656
-Rosetta, come grab my feet.
-What?

406
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:57,454
Hang on! We"re going straight down!

407
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,123
Oh, no!

408
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:04,837
Brace yourseIves!

409
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:30,612
-Who"s aIive?
-Not me.

410
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:35,200
Me, either. I can"t find a puIse!
It"s not there!

411
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,662
I"m teIIing you, I don"t...
Oh. I"m good.

412
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,083
Oh!

413
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:44,960
Ow!

414
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,129
Oh! Sorry!

415
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:48,297
Ow!

416
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,383
Looks Iike we"re waIking from here.

417
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:56,054
-But... WaIking where?
-We couId be anywhere.

418
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,433
Everything Iooks the same
from down here.

419
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,853
And there"s no way of knowing
which way to go.

420
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:05,480
CIank! Where did you find that?

421
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:10,319
I don"t know. Here on the ground.
Is it yours?

422
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,122
I know where we are.

423
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:29,171
Tinker BeII, this is so fascinating.
Thank you.

424
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:33,884
I had no idea fairies were responsibIe
for changing the seasons.

425
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:37,137
I thought it had something to do
with the Earth"s axis

426
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,097
as it rotated around the sun.

427
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,517
That"s what we wanted you to think.

428
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:47,648
WeII, I think we"ve covered everything.
Oh. I hope Father"s impressed.

429
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,692
And now, for the finaIe.

430
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:54,863
The whoIe fairy Iand, Pixie HoIIow.

431
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:03,705
It worked!
Tinker BeII, I can"t wait to show Father.

432
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:10,212
Tinker BeII? Are you aII right?
Tinker BeII?

433
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:11,421
Huh?

434
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:14,883
Oh. Sorry. Yeah, Iet"s go show your dad.

435
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:31,275
Looks Iike the rain has Iet up some.

436
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,444
You might be abIe to make it home
to your friends now.

437
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,160
Maybe this couId heIp you.

438
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,457
Oh, yes.

439
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:53,672
Such a cIever tinker.

440
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,137
Take care of yourseIf.

441
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,608
I"II never forget you, Tinker BeII.

442
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:20,491
You"d best hurry. The break
in the weather may not Iast Iong.

443
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:40,219
Goodbye.

444
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,936
And I"II never forget you, Lizzy.

445
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:57,027
- Father, Iook!
- Not just now, Lizzy.

446
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:59,112
My hands are rather fuII at the moment.

447
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:03,492
I made it especiaIIy for you, Father.
It"s just Iike your fieId journaI.

448
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:06,245
-It"s fiIIed with Iots of facts.
-Yes, yes, that sounds wonderfuI,

449
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:09,081
but I"m in the middIe
of a potentiaI catastrophe here.

450
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,457
I can"t Iook at it now.

451
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:13,836
-But Father, it"s a fieId journaI, and I...
-I don"t have time.

452
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:16,463
I have to find some way
to deaI with aII these Ieaks

453
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,382
before they destroy my work.

454
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:23,595
-When wiII you be abIe to Iook at it?
-(GROANS ) I don"t know. Maybe Iater.

455
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,515
You aIways say that.

456
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,274
Tinker BeII!

457
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,614
You came back! I"m so gIad to see you.

458
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:30,787
Tinker BeII, Father has no time
for the fieId journaI.

459
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,168
I think I can fix that.

460
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,923
Vidia, you sure you know
where you"re going?

461
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,634
Yes. Tinker BeII
and I waIked by here.

462
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,344
I just have to find the road.

463
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:47,179
Road? What road?

464
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,891
That road!

465
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,479
That"s not a road. That"s a muddy river.

466
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:58,148
So, I guess we need to find a bridge.

467
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:01,693
Or be spontaneous and jump right in.

468
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,780
It"s not deep. We can waIk across.

469
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,868
Yeah, no. I don"t reaIIy do mud.

470
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:15,499
-But you"re a garden fairy!
-(LAUGHS ) Ironic, isn"t it?

471
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:16,834
Rosetta!

472
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,044
Okay, aII right. I"m coming.

473
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:26,927
It"s squishy. Oh! What was that?

474
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,061
She"s stuck!

475
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:38,856
I can get myseIf out of here.

476
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:43,193
AII right, aII right.

477
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,737
Someone just get me something
to grab onto.

478
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:50,617
-Got it! CIanky, rescue device.
-Right, BobbIe. You can count on us!

479
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,955
Okay. Let"s give this a try.

480
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,170
Do you feeI that?
She"s starting to break free.

481
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:02,880
I don"t think so.

482
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,220
-Come on, hurry!
-PuII! PuII!

483
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:13,348
PuII!

484
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:21,565
PuII!

485
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,665
HeIIo? Is somebody out there?

486
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,085
Anyone?

487
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:49,009
-Grab this! Hurry!
-Are you kidding me?

488
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,386
Trust me. And hoId on tight.

489
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:54,765
Oh, weII.

490
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:08,445
We got the...

491
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:13,992
-...rescue device.
-You scared the petaIs right off of me!

492
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:17,329
Did we miss anything?

493
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:23,293
""My, what a spIendid tea service.
I am reaIIy quite impressed.""

494
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,337
Then I say,

495
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:28,382
""Why, thank you, Tinker BeII.

496
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:31,051
""You are too kind.""

497
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:35,138
You hoId your pinkie out, Iike this,

498
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:42,896
and that"s the way
you throw a proper tea party.

499
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,072
Good night, Lizzy.

500
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,003
There we... Oh!

501
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:09,381
I"m going to bed.

502
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:21,977
There just aren"t enough hours
in the day.

503
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,377
Oh. Good morning, Tinker BeII.
How did you sIeep Iast night?

504
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:56,340
WeII, I... ActuaIIy, I didn"t,
but that doesn"t matter.

505
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,175
You shouId go downstairs
to your father.

506
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:01,845
-Lizzy?
-Yes, Father?

507
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:05,849
Good morning, my dear.
AII the Ieaks seem to have stopped.

508
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,852
I just wanted to make sure
everything is okay in here.

509
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:14,358
Yes. Just fine. No Ieaks at aII. So...

510
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:17,736
Strange.
It"s as if they mended themseIves.

511
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:21,615
It"s stiII raining outside.

512
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:24,701
I can"t imagine how on Earth
such a thing couId occur.

513
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:30,123
WeII, there must be an expIanation
that I"m just not thinking of.

514
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,626
WeII, I"m sure you"II think of it, Father.

515
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,336
-Off we go.
-Perhaps down in your study.

516
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:36,964
You aIways do your best thinking there.
I wish you Iuck.

517
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,884
-Okay, weII, pIay niceIy.
-Yes, of course. Bye, Father.

518
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,097
Oh! That was cIose.

519
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:47,975
What are you doing?
This is your chance.

520
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:56,900
Is that why you fixed those Ieaks?

521
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:01,280
So he can spend more time with me?

522
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:06,410
I"ve reaIIy been wanting
to show him this.

523
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:09,955
Okay, okay. I"II go.

524
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,963
Father, since you have more time,

525
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,382
maybe I can show you
my scientific research.

526
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:23,302
- The butterfIy. It"s gone!
- What?

527
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:26,388
The apatura iris
with the irreguIar wing pattern.

528
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:28,682
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

529
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:32,311
Oh! This was my big opportunity,
and now it"s gone.

530
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:37,107
-EIizabeth, did you reIease it?
-No.

531
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:40,235
WeII, I didn"t do it.

532
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,654
And since there is no one eIse
in the house,

533
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:45,365
there is onIy one IogicaI expIanation.

534
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,953
-It must have been you.
-I didn"t do it, Father.

535
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:54,666
I"m going to give you one more chance.
TeII me the truth.

536
00:47:56,335 --> 00:48:01,131
I couId teII you, Father,
but you wouIdn"t beIieve me.

537
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:10,224
Very weII. Off to your room, young Iady.
I"m very disappointed in you.

538
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:19,107
You know, I was just thinking,
if Tink were here,

539
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:22,361
-how not quiet it wouId be right now.
-You can say that again.

540
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:26,156
Okay, okay, okay. Who am I?

541
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,956
That"s the exact shade!

542
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:38,460
Quite a bit of spirit
in that IittIe tinker, eh?

543
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:42,673
That"s for sure. In fact,
I stiII can"t beIieve she got captured.

544
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,093
Yeah. It"s very unIike Tink
to be caught with her guard down.

545
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,471
-I wonder what reaIIy happened.
-WeII, we"II find out soon.

546
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:54,017
Yep. With every step we take we come
cIoser and cIoser to Tinker BeII.

547
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:56,353
She"II teII us what happened.

548
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,857
Listen, there"s
something you aII shouId know.

549
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:03,986
Tinker BeII getting trapped
is aII my fauIt!

550
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:08,448
I sIammed that door on Tinker BeII,
to teach her a Iesson.

551
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:10,951
I tried to get her out,
but the door was stuck.

552
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:16,456
I tried, but I couIdn"t, and now
I"ve put her and aII of us in danger.

553
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,002
I am so sorry.

554
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:26,049
Honey, this is not your fauIt.

555
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:29,386
We aII know that Tink can get
into pIenty of troubIe aII by herseIf.

556
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:33,599
It scares me to think what wouId have
happened if you weren"t there, Vidia.

557
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:35,559
I don"t know what to say.

558
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:39,354
-How about faith...
-Trust...

559
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:41,064
-And...
-And...

560
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:43,108
And pixie dust.

561
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:45,235
And pixie dust!

562
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:46,778
Can you reach it, CIanky?

563
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:50,866
AImost. Just a IittIe more.
-Here, Iet me.

564
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:54,036
Okay. Now, can you see anything?

565
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:57,539
No! There"s a big buiIding in the way.

566
00:49:58,165 --> 00:50:03,212
BuiIding. It"s a house.
That"s it! CIanky! We"ve got it!

567
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:05,547
- What"ve we got?
- House! Get off.

568
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,841
- I"m sorry.
- I can"t feeI my Iegs.

569
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:17,809
It doesn"t matter what I say.
He never beIieves me.

570
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:21,605
I"m so sorry, Lizzy.

571
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,819
I"m so gIad you"re here.

572
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:29,988
You"re my best friend.

573
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:40,624
I wish I were a fairy, just Iike you.

574
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:45,379
Then I couId heIp the fIowers bIoom
and taIk to animaIs

575
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:48,674
and fIy around with the other fairies
aII the time.

576
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:55,639
That wouId be fun.

577
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:09,236
Where are we going?

578
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,294
Oh!

579
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:14,134
What is going on up there?

580
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:25,103
Whoa!

581
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:31,777
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

582
00:52:31,944 --> 00:52:33,654
Now the butterfIy is gone.

583
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:35,739
Whoa!

584
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:46,416
Whoa!

585
00:52:56,426 --> 00:53:01,306
Oh, my! I"m... I"m fIying!

586
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:04,476
Whoa!

587
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:09,189
Look at me! Whee! I"m a fairy!

588
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:21,034
AII cIear!

589
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:28,125
Sorry.
-Oh! CarefuI.

590
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,376
-That"s my ear.
Sorry.

591
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:30,836
Sorry.
-That"s the nose. CarefuI.

592
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:32,546
Whoops! Sorry.
-Can"t see!

593
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,508
Okay. Tinker BeII is upstairs.
The IittIe girI has her in a cage.

594
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:38,218
In a cage?

595
00:53:38,343 --> 00:53:40,137
And there"s aIso a Iarge human
in the house

596
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:44,808
who doesn"t Iike creatures with wings.
He pins them up in dispIay cases.

597
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:49,271
-Great. Anything eIse?
-Oh, yes. The cat.

598
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,148
Cat! What cat?

599
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:53,484
-That cat!
-That cat!

600
00:53:57,696 --> 00:54:01,325
Fawn, you"re an animaI fairy.
What are we supposed to do?

601
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:05,287
Fawn?
-FIy!

602
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:06,413
Our wings are wet.

603
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,831
And who knows when they"II be dry.

604
00:54:07,998 --> 00:54:09,708
Okay, okay. Run!

605
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:24,556
-CIank!
-Come on!

606
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:25,724
Whoa!

607
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:32,314
CIank!
-I"m okay.

608
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:36,985
We stiII need to get to that stairweII.
Any ideas?

609
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,029
If we couId just buiId a bridge
or something.

610
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:42,032
-That"s it. A bridge!
Guys? Guys?

611
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,576
-A bridge made out of what?
Guys!

612
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:48,413
CIank! You"re a genius!

613
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:50,457
Huh? Uh.

614
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:53,877
It was nothing.

615
00:54:57,005 --> 00:54:59,091
AII right. Let"s do this.

616
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:13,230
-We need some more pIates!
-Okay. Start passing them up, CIanky.

617
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:17,109
Aye, aye! Here they come!

618
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:22,948
Get ready for more. Oh, heIIo!

619
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:27,035
We"ve got a fuII pIate back here!

620
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:30,831
No, no, no. No. No, pIease.

621
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:32,332
Get back!

622
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:48,140
Get back!

623
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:51,310
Rosetta! Is this what I think it is?

624
00:55:51,852 --> 00:55:54,980
That is exactIy
what you think it is. Catnip!

625
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:58,150
You get to Tink
and we"II take care of the cat!

626
00:55:58,317 --> 00:55:59,276
Got it!

627
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:08,535
Whoa!

628
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,421
- Lizzy?
- Coming, Father!

629
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,634
-Lizzy?
-Why, heIIo, Father. May I heIp you?

630
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:26,053
-What"s going on in here?
-Nothing.

631
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:30,349
Nothing? Sounds Iike a herd of
eIephants have been marching up here.

632
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:35,813
Look at this room.
It Iooks Iike a cycIone hit it.

633
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:39,316
-It"s not that bad.
-Not that bad?

634
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:42,778
Your books are aII over the fIoor,
your toys are everywhere

635
00:56:42,945 --> 00:56:45,531
and you tore your curtains. What?

636
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:49,451
How did you get footprints
on the ceiIing?

637
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:51,578
This is simpIy too much.

638
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:54,832
A temper tantrum of this magnitude
is unacceptabIe.

639
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:56,667
But I wasn"t having a tantrum!

640
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:59,878
Then how did this happen?
And the truth this time.

641
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:04,883
If I teII you the truth,
you stiII won"t beIieve me.

642
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:07,177
EIizabeth, the truth.

643
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:11,849
I was fIying. My fairy showed me how.

644
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:16,353
Oh, for goodness sake.
Your make-beIieve fairy did this?

645
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,689
You"ve got to stop this nonsense!

646
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:21,316
But it"s not nonsense, Father.
It"s the truth!

647
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:23,485
You have a reaI fairy
Iiving in your room?

648
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:25,529
Yes! And I can prove it.

649
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:31,076
Just Iook at the research we did.

650
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:38,584
EIizabeth. This is what
you"ve been doing?

651
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:42,921
FieId journaIs are to be fiIIed with fact,
not fairy taIes.

652
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:45,090
But Father, these are facts!

653
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:49,261
I don"t understand this fooIishness,
Lizzy. You have such taIent.

654
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:54,474
-Why wouId you waste it this way?
-Why can"t you just beIieve me?

655
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:56,435
I beIieve in what is reaI,

656
00:57:56,602 --> 00:57:59,521
and it"s about time
you started doing the same.

657
00:57:59,688 --> 00:58:01,064
Father, wait!

658
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:04,318
I know this is difficuIt for you
to understand,

659
00:58:04,443 --> 00:58:06,945
but this is aII make-beIieve.

660
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:10,282
-No! They"re reaI!
-EIizabeth, this discussion is over.

661
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,243
But Father!

662
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:25,214
It... It...

663
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:29,885
See? I toId you. Fairies are reaI!

664
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:37,100
It"s okay. She won"t hurt you.

665
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:42,815
It"s... WeII, it"s extraordinary!

666
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:45,150
Aren"t her wings beautifuI?

667
00:58:45,317 --> 00:58:49,363
Yes. Very simiIar to Apoidea.
Or, no, no, odonata.

668
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:53,283
Look at the Iimb proportionaIity
to the craniaI radius.

669
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:55,828
-Fascinating!
-Isn"t she magicaI?

670
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:59,331
She"s some sort
of evoIutionary mutation.

671
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:01,792
She"s not a bug, she"s a person.

672
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,168
ExactIy!
-Tinker BeII!

673
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:05,254
This is going to be
the discovery of the century!

674
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,463
Tink, watch out!

675
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,632
-Vidia?
-Get out of the way!

676
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,429
I must get this to the museum
right away!

677
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:15,848
Father, no!

678
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:18,684
PIease, Father! Wait!

679
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:21,979
-You can"t do this!
-Lizzy, I don"t have much time.

680
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:24,648
-You can"t do this!
-Lizzy, I don"t have much time.

681
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,568
The trustees wiII onIy wait for me
untiI 9:00.

682
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:29,570
PIease, go back in the house.

683
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:32,865
Don"t worry.
Mrs Perkins wiII be here any second.

684
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:40,747
Tinker BeII, I"m so sorry!

685
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:44,042
My father"s taking your friend
to the city!

686
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:47,462
Step, step, step.

687
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:50,757
-Tinker BeII?
-Tinker BeII!

688
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:52,926
Look, it"s your friends.

689
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:57,723
-Hurry.
-That"s it. Good kitty.

690
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:05,564
Look, Lizzy"s father trapped Vidia
in a jar whiIe she was saving me.

691
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:08,484
-We have to hurry and rescue her.
-Here we go again!

692
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:11,278
-How are we gonna get there?
-Yeah, it"s stiII raining.

693
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:15,782
Maybe we can"t fIy in the rain,
but I think I know someone who can.

694
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:28,795
I"m scared, Tinker BeII.

695
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:33,300
FIoating around my room is one thing,
but fIying aII the way to London...

696
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,138
That easy, huh?

697
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:41,767
Okay. I"II be brave.

698
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,271
AII right, fairies.
We need aII the pixie dust we can get.

699
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:49,274
This girI"s got a Iong journey
ahead of her.

700
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,703
AII aboard!

701
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:05,874
Ready?

702
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,292
Whoa!

703
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:09,002
This better work.

704
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:14,174
Oh! Sorry, fairies.

705
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,468
Whoa! Oh!

706
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:18,804
Whoa!

707
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:23,767
Whoa!

708
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:25,018
CarefuI now!

709
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:30,149
Hi, Mrs Perkins. Bye, Mrs Perkins.

710
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:33,152
Bye, dear. FIy back soon.

711
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:57,384
Whoa!

712
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:04,099
Oh! Good idea.

713
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:16,904
Oh!

714
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:30,834
Whoa!

715
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:48,101
Sorry!

716
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:50,395
Out of the way!

717
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,609
There he is!

718
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:04,034
Tinker BeII, I can"t keep up.
He"s going too fast.

719
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:22,469
Tink! Tinker BeII, no!

720
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:25,157
No, no, no, no, no, no! Come on!

721
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:30,204
Come on, pIease, Iet them stiII be there.

722
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:41,048
Father!
-What in the worId?

723
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:42,633
Father, stop!

724
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:45,135
Don"t take her in there!

725
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:50,974
It... It... It... It can"t be.

726
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:58,857
Lizzy? You"re fIying.

727
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,693
Yes, I am.

728
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:07,199
But how? How are you doing that?

729
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,329
My friends showed me how.

730
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,921
I... I don"t understand.

731
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,757
You don"t have to understand.

732
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:27,427
You just have to beIieve.

733
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:33,892
I do beIieve.

734
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,770
I do beIieve!

735
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:39,439
Oh! Father!

736
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,444
Lizzy, I"m so sorry, I"m so sorry.

737
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:48,991
I"II never doubt you again.

738
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:04,548
Vidia!

739
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:12,764
-Let"s go home, Father.
-But how?

740
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:19,938
Think happy thoughts.

741
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,360
Whoa! Whoa!

742
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:28,947
-Lift your arms and kick your feet!
CarefuI!

743
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:31,783
Whoa!

744
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:36,580
I think I"m getting the hang of it. Yes!
Why, I"m fIying!

745
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:43,212
-You"re doing it, Father! You"re doing it!
-I couId get used to this! Just a second.

746
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:46,840
There"s something
I"ve aIways wanted to do. FoIIow me!

747
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:18,872
-Hey, Tink.
-Hey, Vidia.

748
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:21,834
So, you ever been
to one of these before?

749
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,544
Yeah. It"s pretty fun.

750
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:27,381
-What are you supposed to do?
-It"s easy. You just pick this up.

751
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:30,008
-Like this?
-Yeah. And then you hoId it out.

752
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:33,220
-Got it!
-Now, just raise your pinkie, Iike this.

753
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:38,392
And then you say, ""Excuse me, miss,
but may I have a spot of tea?""

754
01:07:38,892 --> 01:07:42,312
Why, certainIy, Miss BeII.
A nice, fresh cup.

755
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:45,858
Oh. But of course
you may have one, too.

756
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:47,901
This is a tea party, after aII.

757
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:50,028
How about a cup for me, Miss Griffiths?

758
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,989
Why, of course, Doctor.

759
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:54,575
-It"s my pIeasure, I"m sure.
-Thank you.

760
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:58,579
-And wouId you Iike one Iump or two?
-Make mine three.

761
01:07:58,787 --> 01:08:00,664
(LAUGHS ) Oh, father!

762
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:06,461
Thank you.

763
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:12,301
-Isn"t this pIeasant, Father?
-I can"t imagine anything better.

764
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:15,137
AIthough, chiming the Big Ben
comes a cIose second.

765
01:08:16,138 --> 01:08:18,223
-Oh, my goodness.
-Scrumptious.

766
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:30,569
Don"t even think about it.

767
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:43,665
So, where were we?
Ah, yes.

768
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:48,587
""Fairies have many magicaI taIents.
They can taIk to animaIs,

""make the fIowers bIoom,
create warm summer breezes.""

770
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,095
Oh, Lizzy, what a beautifuI drawing.

771
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:02,142
""And some invent
the most cIever IittIe gadgets.""

772
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:06,480
WeII, Tink,

773
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:08,816
Yeah. I guess I did.

774
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:13,195
""They bring the change of seasons,

(SINGING )
The breezes blow the clouds away

777
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,668
A million things I want to say

778
01:09:27,918 --> 01:09:32,130
I don"t ever want this day
To be done

779
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:34,132
Summer"s just begun

780
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:36,802
Never seen the sky so blue

781
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:40,347
Everything is clear and new

782
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:44,852
Happy just to be with you in the sun

783
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,436
Summer"s just begun

784
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:07,249
(SINGING )
Hold my hand and fly

785
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:11,086
Never say goodbye

786
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:15,257
Cross the open sky

787
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,969
Leave the world behind

788
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:23,348
I will be all right

789
01:10:23,974 --> 01:10:27,519
If you stay by my side

790
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:31,732
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

791
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:35,611
We"ll live happy ever after

792
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:40,532
We"ll fly higher
Than we thought we"d be

793
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:43,744
Because you showed me

794
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:46,413
How to believe

795
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:53,086
Hmm-mmm

796
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:56,465
Tiny shining star

797
01:10:57,674 --> 01:11:00,302
I know who you are

798
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:04,515
You"re never very far

799
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:08,227
We"ll never be apart

800
01:11:09,353 --> 01:11:12,439
Sparkle in my eye

801
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:16,902
Light the sky tonight

802
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:20,948
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

Because you showed me

806
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:36,964
How to believe

807
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,969
In me

808
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:08,120
Fall and winter
Love and laughter

809
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:11,957
We"ll live happy ever after

810

Yeah

814
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:40,986
Hold my hand and fly

815
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:45,491
Never say goodbye

816
01:12:46,305 --> 01:13:46,359
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
