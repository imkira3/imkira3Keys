If you want to live here,
you got to start chipping in.

Where's Greg's settlement check?
Get the money from him.

I can't.

642
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,925
He's going to ask me and Lily
to move away with him.

I can't freak him out...

Mom, stop living your life like this!

645

If you cared about Lily,
you'd get a job and quit fucking around.

Why does Manny give me
so much shit all the time?

660
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,844
Maybe because you give him reason to.

661

Stick to the plan, man.

662

You'll get me fired.

I'm your girlfriend.

No, you're not. We broke up.
I'll call you later.

You just left without saying a word.

670

I left you the car.

671
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,095
Was it 'cause I said I was pregnant?

672

I know why you said that bullshit.

673

Tell me why you left and I'll leave you alone.

Would you just go!

679
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,661
Everyone's calling you a loser

They bust some serious shit.

697

Those white boys are
more like busters on serious shit.

I won't bump no Beasties.

00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,855
Yes, ma'am. I'm Mrs. Johnson.

786
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,234
MRS. JOHNSON: Sarah Jane?
I brought you these...

787
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,909
JIMMY: You win at bingo tonight?

788
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:21,869
No.

789
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,538
You record your demo yet?

790
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,875
What happened to you?

791
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:31,879
Cheddar Bob had an accident, but he's fine.
I'm fine.

792
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,257
You and your friends.

793
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,343
Mom, don't start, please.

It's been a long fucking night.

795
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,555
Tell me about it.

796
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,559
Me and Greg are having problems.

797
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,311
He found out about the eviction?

798
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,479
No.

799
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,608
- The settlement check ain't coming.
- No, it's coming.

It's our sex life.

STEPHANIE: I mean, it's good. It's real good.

803
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,535
But he won't...

804
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,161
I don't want to hear this!

805
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,871
Greg won't go down on me.

806

JIMMY: Hey, Sol.

808
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,604
Ever wonder at what point
you got to say, "Fuck it"?

809
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:36,443
When you got to stop living up here
and start living down here?

810
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,740
It's 7:30 in the morning, dawg.

811
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,500
- Thank your mom for the car.
- All right.

812
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:08,601
(RAPPING) I'm getting so sick and tired
of fucking with this steel

813
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,937
They only give us 30 minutes
to eat lunch and chill

just to get a buck

I'm sick of eating shit
off this fucking lunch truck

Nasty-ass food
I'm in a nasty-ass mood

817
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,241
Should have called in sick
Shit, I had somethin' to do!

818

all this ravin' and rantin'

819
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,664
From Vanessa up here
at New Detroit Stampin'

820
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,959
Need to get your food
and take your ass back to work

821
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,046
You're dreamin' if you think
them corny-ass raps'll work

822

Look at y'all standin' here

Rappin' and waitin' for food
off this raggedy lunch truck

Who want what?
Who pumped up to get rolled up?

825
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,974
I spit venom in every direction
Soak some up

826
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,770
Look at this fat-ass nigga
Sloppy sucka

Enough with the gay jokes

broke bitch yourself

don't even risk it

You want to quit, but you can't

You've worked at this plant so long
You're a plant!

They're starting to grow roots!

On this mic, you get faded

854
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,601
You look like a pissed-off rapper
who never made it

855
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,895
Hey, why you fuckin'
with the gay guy, G?

You want to do something tonight?

Are you asking me out on a date,
Jimmy Smith, Jr?

865
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,388
As a matter of fact, I am.

866
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,975
Why don't you take me somewhere now?

867
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,605
Come on.

And at the Chin Tiki the other night.

And that demo thing with Wink.

876

- Stop it.
- I did, when he was little.

927

He had buckteeth and big ears.

928
