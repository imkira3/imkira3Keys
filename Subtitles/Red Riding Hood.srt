2
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,416
Full moon. Lock up tonight.

3
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,268
Better the wolf takes the pig than you.

4
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,816
We lived on the edge of a dark forest.

5
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,070
Few knew our village by name...

6
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,653
...but many had heard of the terrible
things that happened there.

7
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,907
My mother always told me,
"Don't talk to strangers.

8
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,244
Go get water and come straight home."

9
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,752
I tried to be a good girl
and do what she said.

10
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,545
Valerie.

11
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,090
Believe me, I tried.

12
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,754
Let's go.

13
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,928
Shh.

14
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,429
Do you have the knife?

15
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,395
Right here.

16
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,614
Look, snow white fur.

17
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,579
I'll make you a pair of hunting boots.

18
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,639
Do it, Peter.

19
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,221
- You do it.
- No, you do it.

20
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,097
That's it.

21
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:02,956
I know good girls aren't supposed
to hunt rabbits or go into the woods alone.

22
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,167
But since we were kids, he always had a
way of making me wanna break the rules.

23
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,005
Peter! Trees'll still be there after we eat.

24
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,982
- Give me that.
- What will you give me for it?

25
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,904
- They didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

26
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,455
They've arranged for you to marry
Henry Lazar.

27
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,922
Well, my mother finally got
what she wanted.

28
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,458
Money.

29
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,171
Henry gets what he's always wanted.
You.

30
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,135
So, what do we do now?

31
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,474
Do you want to marry him?

32
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,144
You know I don't.

33
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,104
Prove it.

34
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,189
- How?
- Run away with me.

35
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,862
Where would we go?

36
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,568
Anywhere you want.

37
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,609
The ocean.

38
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,156
The city.

39
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,622
The mountains.

40
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,294
You afraid?

41
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,079
- No.
- Oh, no?

42
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,041
Really?

43
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,801
You'd leave your home?

44
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,304
Your family?

45
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,008
Your whole life?

46
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,307
I would do anything to be with you.

47
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,935
I thought you'd say that.

48
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,276
- Oh, did you?
- Ha, ha.

49
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,484
Let's do something about it.

50
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,455
It'd be half a day's ride before
anyone knows we're gone.

51
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,162
I'll race you.

52
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,797
The wolf.

53
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,222
This way! Over here!

54
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,826
It killed again.

55
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,535
But we've kept the peace.

56
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,827
Well, the wolf has broken it.

57
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,041
Who is it?

58
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,998
Tell me.

59
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,466
It's your sister.

60
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,053
Mother, Father.

61
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,237
Lucie!

62
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,540
Lucie!

63
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,793
Thank you, Claude.

64
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,970
- Madame Lazar, please come in.
- Suzette.

65
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,967
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

66
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,348
Let me take that.

67
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,599
- Hello, Henry.
- Ladies.

68
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,768
Lucie was a good girl.

69
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,871
He's your fiancé now.
He's come to offer his condolences.

70
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,329
- But I barely know him.
- You'll get to know him.

71
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,500
Now go down there. Please.

72
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,681
Cesaire.

73
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,388
Come with us to the tavern.

74
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,179
Let the women grieve in their own way.

75
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,369
- L-- l-- I want to go.
- No.

76
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,547
I didn't love your father
when we were first married.

77
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,388
I was in love with another man.

78
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,559
But I came to love your father.

79
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:40,190
And he gave me
two beautiful daughters.

80
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,478
We should count our blessings.

81
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,691
Come on, Father.

82
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,279
It's been almost 20 years since
the wolf has taken a human life.

83
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,862
Twenty years.

84
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:55,371
That's because we sacrifice
our best livestock every full moon.

85
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,203
We kept our end of the bargain.

86
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,918
- So now we kill it.
- Yeah!

87
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,580
Let's kill that thing!

88
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,462
No.

89
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,382
I've summoned Father Solomon.

90
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,262
- Father Solomon?
- Ha-ha-ha.

91
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:15,096
He has destroyed Werewolves and witches
in cities throughout the kingdom.

92
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,010
He will rid us of this beast.

93
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,720
No.

94
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,103
He'll rob us of our vengeance.

95
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,108
I wonder why she was outside
on a wolf night.

96
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,735
Maybe she snuck out to meet a boy.

97
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,617
My Lucie never even
thought about boys.

98
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,950
She was certainly taken
with my grandson.

99
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,037
She used to come by and follow him
about like a puppy.

100
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,962
She found out that night that Henry
was engaged to her sister.

101
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,422
She must have been heartbroken.

102
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,214
Maybe she chose to die
rather than live without him.

103
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,136
How romantic.

104
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,425
Prudence!

105
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,310
It's unspeakable.

106
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,972
She never even told me.

107
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,313
Don't worry, dear.

108
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,979
Henry always had his eye on you.

109
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,114
You're the pretty one.

110
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,914
I'm paying my respects.

111
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,300
I know exactly why you're here.

112
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,131
I've already lost one daughter.

113
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,637
Valerie's all I have left.

114
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,927
You have nothing to offer her.

115
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,969
I have a trade. The same one
as your husband.

116
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,267
I know what a woodcutter earns.

117
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,980
Henry's her only hope for a better life.

118
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,233
If you love her...

119
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,982
...you'll let her go.

120
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,045
We've all seen the bones on the trail
to Mount Grimmoor.

121
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,134
That's where the wolf makes its lair.

122
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,386
We know the weaknesses of the werewolf.

123
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,019
It can't come out in daylight.
It can't step onto holy ground.

124
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,555
- And there's silver.
- That'll kill it.

125
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,848
Silver!

126
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,734
Maybe Father Auguste is right.

127
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,482
Maybe we should wait.

128
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,693
Coward.

129
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,534
Maybe, my son...

130
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,287
...you should find your courage.

131
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,998
You want to hunt the wolf?

132
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,454
Let's hunt it.

133
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,742
Let's kill it!

134
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,582
Let's kill the beast!

135
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,962
Let's kill it!

136
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,093
What's going on?

137
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,944
Come on, boys!

138
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,855
Are you with me?!

139
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,529
Let's go!

140
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,069
Be careful.

141
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,615
I lost my sister. I can't lose you too.

142
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,580
We can't do this anymore.

143
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,336
You have to go through with it.
You have to marry Henry.

144
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,918
But you know I don't want Henry.

145
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,129
Don't make this something it's not.

146
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,295
Look, we had our fun.
That's all it ever was.

147
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,297
I don't believe you.

148
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,530
I made something for you.

149
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,833
I was gonna wait until our wedding,
but, uh ....

150
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,834
Just in case.

151
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,540
You will be happy again.

152
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,668
I promise.

153
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,351
Come on, Henry.

154
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,770
We should wait.

155
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,189
- We should wait for Father Solomon.
- No!

156
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,691
He'll be here tomorrow!

157
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,729
- We're gonna kill the wolf.
- We can take care of this.

158
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,942
That's it? Nobody else?

159
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,821
Let's go! Go home to your mama's, then.

160
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:13,564
Adrian. Thank you for standing up for
Lucie. That was no small thing.

161
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,602
We'll be family soon.
You'd have done the same.

162
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,263
Promise me you'll be careful.

163
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,053
Don't worry.

164
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,095
The wolf doesn't want me. I'm all gristle.

165
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,850
I mean it, son.

166
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,352
I promise, Mama.

167
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,618
Grandmother.

168
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,908
Oh.

169
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,749
Darling. Darling.

170
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,208
Come.

171
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,582
Careful.

172
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,509
There are so many things
she didn't tell me.

173
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,809
And I'm her sister. I should've known.

174
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,928
That was her choice.

175
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,399
We all have secrets.

176
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,984
Remember what my grandma
used to say:

177
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:55,833
- "All sorrows are less with bread."
- "Less with bread."

178
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,597
Here. Try this.

179
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,702
How beautiful.

180
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,786
I was making it for your wedding.

181
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,005
I don't feel like it's my wedding.

182
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,682
I feel like...

183
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,553
...I'm being sold.

184
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,865
Right up there.

185
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,419
You better watch yourself.

186
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,432
There's a fork.

187
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,813
Let's split up.

188
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,513
Another fork.

189
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,803
We'll take the steep one.

190
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,598
No. We should stay together.

191
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,509
Good morning, dear.

192
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,970
Morning, Grandmother.

193
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,057
Grandmother told us
that the wolf used to kill entire families...

194
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,772
...snatching children from their beds.

195
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:54,030
Those stories never seemed real to me.
Until now.

196
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,138
Ripped the thing out!

197
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,282
Claude.

198
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,193
To Adrian.

199
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,313
For his sacrifice.

200
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,322
To Adrian.

201
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,995
Poor Henry.

202
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,380
Henry.

203
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,389
Your father was a brave man.

204
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,677
You know, I was close enough to smell it.

205
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,852
And I was afraid. And I hid from it.

206
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,934
I didn't do anything.

207
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,732
I should've saved him.

208
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,372
- Henry--
- Just leave!

209
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,247
I don't want you to see me like this.

210
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,579
It was Henry's father, wasn't it?
The man you loved?

211
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,664
Lucie was in love with him.

212
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,751
She was a year older than me.
She could've married him.

213
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,256
Why did you insist it was me?

214
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,713
I think you know the answer to that.

215
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,090
I want you to say it.

216
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,598
Lucie was Henry's half-sister.

217
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,431
Adrian was her father.

218
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,943
Does Papa know about Lucie?

219
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,027
No. And you have to promise me
that you'll never tell.

220
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,116
Father Solomon.

221
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,707
He's here.

222
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,858
Claude.

223
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,590
Presenting His Eminence ....

224
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,099
Father Solomon.

225
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,688
Papa.

226
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,360
Oh, please don't cry.

227
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,697
You see? You see all these children?

228
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,203
You see how scared they are?

229
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:58,163
There's a big, bad wolf.
Someone has to stop it.

230
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:02,497
Is that the beast that killed our mother?

231
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,916
It may very well be.

232
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,593
Go on. I'll join you soon.

233
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,094
No.

234
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,800
Go.

235
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,153
This is indeed an honor, Your Eminence.

236
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:39,082
Welcome.
You've arrived just in time for our festival.

237
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:44,418
As you can see,
the werewolf has been dealt with.

238
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,343
That is not a werewolf.

239
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,765
No disrespect...

240
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,141
...but we have been living
with this beast for two generations.

241
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,897
We know what we're dealing with.

242
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,274
Well, no disrespect...

243
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,227
...but you have no idea
what you are dealing with.

244
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,028
I was like you once.

245
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:17,617
My wife's name was Penelope.

246
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,703
She gave me two beautiful daughters.

247
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,419
We were a very happy family.

248
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,502
We lived in a village like this.

249
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,592
And like Daggerhorn...

250
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,138
...ours was plagued by a werewolf.

251
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:40,011
One full moon,
my friends and I got drunk.

252
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,763
We decided to hunt it.

253
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:48,444
It never occurred to us that we might
actually find it, but find it we did.

254
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,896
It ripped...

255
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,487
...my best friend in half.

256
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,820
Quickly.

257
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,121
And then it was on me.

258
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:05,040
I hacked and hacked at it with my ax.

259
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,835
Suddenly...

260
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,208
...it was gone.

261
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,962
I had cut off one of its front paws.

262
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,132
I thought it might make a clever
souvenir, and so I took it home.

263
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,051
And there I found my wife...

264
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,938
...with a bloody rag
wrapped around her wrist.

265
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,941
And when I opened my sack...

266
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,645
...the werewolf's paw...

267
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,400
...was gone.

268
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,028
This was in its place.

269
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,622
I told my girls
the werewolf killed their mother.

270
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,216
But that was a lie.

271
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,052
I killed her.

272
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,425
When a werewolf dies,
it returns to its human form.

273
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,391
That is just a common gray wolf.

274
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,225
Your werewolf...

275
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,696
...is still very much alive.

276
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,838
This is one of only three silver swords
blessed by the Holy See.

277
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,756
May I touch?

278
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,265
No.

279
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,433
This is a very dangerous time.

280
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,186
You all know
what the Blood Moon means.

281
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,737
They have no idea what it means.

282
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,838
The orrery.

283
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:21,881
The red planet converges with the moon
once every 13 years.

284
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:26,594
This is the only time
a new werewolf can be created.

285
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,474
During the week of the Blood Moon...

286
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,644
...the werewolf may pass his curse on
with a single bite.

287
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:39,190
During a normal full moon,
a wolf bite will kill you.

288
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,608
But during a Blood Moon...

289
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,945
...your very souls are in danger.

290
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:51,749
Until the Blood Moon wanes in three days...

291
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,412
...you will never truly be safe.

292
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,628
We're safe now.
I killed the wolf in its lair.

293
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,509
The cave at Mount Grimmoor.

294
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,171
You have been deceived
by this beast from the start.

295
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,180
It made you think
it lived on Grimmoor...

296
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,310
...so that you would not look for it
in the most obvious place.

297
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,806
The wolf lives here.

298
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,517
In this village.

299
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,689
Among you.

300
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,985
The real killer could be your neighbor.

301
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,149
- What?
- Your best friend.

302
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,822
Even your wife.

303
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,631
- Barricade the village.
- You can't do that!

304
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,135
Post men at every gate!
No one leaves until we kill the wolf!

305
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,047
- As you wish.
- The wolf is dead.

306
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,055
Tonight we celebrate!

307
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,719
Yes!

308
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:09,071
Go ahead. Celebrate.

309
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,290
We'll see who is right.

310
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,045
The wolf is dead!

311
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,388
Take it off!

312
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,613
I'll huff, and I'll puff...

313
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:55,622
...and I'll blow your house down!

314
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,978
Laugh at the little man!

315
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,667
Valerie, come dance.

316
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,678
I'll huff...

317
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,138
...I'll puff...

318
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,508
...and I'll blow your house down.

319
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,896
OW!

320
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,694
I'll just flick this off.
I'll be fit to see the pope.

321
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,112
Papa.

322
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,909
You're my good girl.

323
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,957
I'm so sorry.

324
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,044
I know. Just go home now, okay?

325
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,076
Tricked you. Ha-ha-ha.

326
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,738
Impressive.

327
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,331
Where did you learn that?

328
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,992
Claude.

329
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,413
Claude, come back to the party.

330
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,263
Looks like Rose has a new conquest.

331
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,250
Come on, Prudence.

332
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,131
You left us!

333
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,345
Take it easy, friend.

334
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:43,512
I said we should stick together and you
left us, and my father is dead because of it!

335
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,975
Please don't do this.

336
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,311
Keep your hands off her
or I'll cut them off!

337
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:51,945
Peter.

338
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,171
Leave me alone.

339
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,717
What's the matter with you?
What do I have to do to make you stop?

340
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,726
I love you, Peter.

341
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,770
What are you doing with Rose?
You don't even like her.

342
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,398
I don't have to like her
to get what I want from her.

343
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,063
You're a terrible liar.

344
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,736
I know you feel like I do.

345
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,072
I know you're burning inside.

346
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,113
I'll never be able to give you
anything like this.

347
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,826
Think I care about Henry's money?

348
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,414
You have a future with him.
I'm not gonna let you ruin that.

349
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,546
Did my mother get to you?

350
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,417
Valerie, I'm wrong for you.

351
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,013
I don't care.

352
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,531
I could eat you up.

353
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,822
Don't you want me?

354
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,841
Hey, Peter.

355
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,799
Come on, give us a hand.

356
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,183
The only life I want is with you.

357
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,689
So where did you disappear to?

358
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,192
You know all that soft hay
in the granary?

359
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,548
- Run!
- Get to the church!

360
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,552
- Peter!
- Go!

361
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,221
Claude!

362
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,772
You will die now, beast!

363
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,782
The wolf can't cross onto holy ground!
Get to the church!

364
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:10,991
The church!

365
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,415
Claude!

366
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,633
Now! Rope it!

367
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,133
Hold him!

368
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,893
Claude!

369
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,154
- It's strong.
- God is stronger.

370
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,284
God is stronger!

371
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,023
I warned you!

372
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,313
I warned you!

373
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:31,948
Your werewolf is still alive!

374
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,487
Find it!

375
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,364
Find it!

376
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,959
Find it.

377
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,458
Over there!

378
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,912
You can't escape from me.

379
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,122
Oh, my God. You can speak.

380
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,873
How?

381
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,340
You understand me.
That's all that matters, Valerie.

382
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,379
You know my name.

383
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,257
What are you doing?

384
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,516
Human eyes, dark brown.

385
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,935
I know you well.

386
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:51,231
You dream of leaving this village.

387
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,866
Let me take you away.

388
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,285
You and I are the same.

389
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,789
No, I'm nothing like you.
You're a murderer.

390
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,699
You're a killer too, aren't you?

391
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:07,130
What happened to the rabbit, Valerie?

392
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,583
I killed it.

393
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,594
I know. So come with me.

394
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:15,634
No.

395
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:19,391
Then the streets will run red
with blood. Starting with hers.

396
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,225
Come on!

397
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,306
Father Solomon will stop you.

398
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:28,272
Father Solomon will die like the rest.

399
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,108
I'm coming back for you
before the Blood Moon wanes.

400
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,032
There! Fire!

401
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,677
You talked to the wolf.

402
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,303
No, it talked to us.

403
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,714
No, it growled.

404
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,474
Wait, you heard it talk to you?

405
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,014
They'll call me a witch.
Don't tell anyone.

406
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,724
No, of course not.

407
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,811
- Get inside onto holy ground.
- Wait, I have to find my brother.

408
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,693
- And my family.
- No one leaves until sunrise.

409
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,855
- Go.
- For your own safety.

410
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,264
We were wrong to have doubted you,
Father.

411
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,517
I've never seen a beast as strong as this.

412
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:51,894
A creature this powerful must come
from a long uninterrupted bloodline.

413
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:57,323
Each generation
more potent than the one before.

414
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,194
We must find it in its human form.

415
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,364
But how? It could be any of them.

416
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:09,745
It hasn't survived this long
by being obvious. Look everywhere.

417
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,502
Look for the signs.

418
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,751
Isolation.

419
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,179
Witchcraft.

420
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,511
The black arts.

421
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,721
Abnormal behavior.

422
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,557
Strange smells.

423
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,606
Your homes will be searched.

424
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,314
Your secrets brought to light.

425
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,981
If you are innocent,
you have nothing to fear.

426
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,284
But if you are guilty...

427
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,287
...I swear by Almighty God...

428
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,665
...you will be destroyed.

429
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:52,829
He's still alive!

430
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,877
Bring me water!

431
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,212
Hurry!

432
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,145
It's a Blood Moon. So he must--

433
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,980
He's my brother!

434
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,753
A man bitten...

435
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,593
...is a man cursed!

436
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,127
Valerie, open the door.

437
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,090
We're all in danger.
So we've gotta leave now.

438
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,391
Come away with me.

439
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,271
Come away with me.

440
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,401
Come away with me.

441
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:45,783
Get your things. We have to leave now.

442
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,570
I can't go with you, Peter.

443
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,538
Why not?

444
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,326
I'm sorry.

445
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,774
What happened?

446
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:23,029
She's going to be all right.

447
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:28,576
The wolf just scratched her.
That's not a bite.

448
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,529
Lift her head, Valerie.

449
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,119
Here. Drink this, dear.

450
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,410
It'll help you sleep.

451
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,262
You sleep.

452
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,402
What is it, darling?

453
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:10,947
What is it?

454
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,203
The wolf.

455
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:14,780
It talked to me.

456
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,002
And you understood it?

457
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,288
As clearly as I understand you.

458
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,295
Have you told anyone else about this?

459
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:33,174
Only Roxanne knows,
but she won't tell anyone.

460
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,684
She won't even talk to me about it.

461
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,805
It chose not to kill you.

462
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,645
I think it wants me alive.

463
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,577
- No.
- Bring me another bandage.

464
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,046
No.

465
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,632
I have to get clean water.

466
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,891
Has Claude come home?

467
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,977
Nobody's seen him.

468
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,646
There you go, back inside. Now.

469
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,529
You have to let us in.

470
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,915
I saw you with Peter.

471
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:45,167
I know you don't want me like that.

472
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,421
I'm not gonna force you to marry me.

473
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,637
I'm gonna break off the engagement.

474
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,611
I'm sorry, Henry.

475
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,664
That's enough!

476
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,959
Father Solomon!
We found someone hiding!

477
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,752
In the tower!

478
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,221
Quickly!

479
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,646
- It's my brother! Don't touch him!
- Get him down!

480
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,765
- Interrogate him!
- He's not the wolf!

481
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,149
Look at him!

482
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,779
His speech is twisted.
He communes with demons.

483
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,063
Get him down! Now!

484
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:55,983
He hasn't done anything!

485
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,996
This is proof
that he studies the black arts!

486
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,201
He's a conjurer.

487
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,287
- I know him.
- Better than I knew my own wife?

488
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:09,421
You never know
what someone is capable of.

489
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,048
Get him down! Come on!

490
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,285
Give me the name of the wolf.

491
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:48,332
Give me the name.

492
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,622
Tell me the name!

493
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,808
The Romans invented this.

494
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,233
An ingenious system
for extracting the truth.

495
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:19,067
How can he give you a name?
The boy can barely speak.

496
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:23,079
Listen to how he sings
of his love of Satan.

497
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,916
We do this for the greater good.

498
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,419
What's the good in this?

499
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,511
I killed my wife to protect my children.

500
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:43,174
Our methods of pleasing God
are sometimes flawed.

501
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,724
You had best develop a stomach for it.

502
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,918
She says it's important.

503
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,801
I've come to bargain
for the release of my brother.

504
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,846
Silver fingernails.

505
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,140
To kill a werewolf.

506
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,646
Get out.

507
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,658
Please, I have more than money to offer.

508
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,499
Turn around.

509
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,304
Enough. Move.

510
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:11,641
Wait, please. I have something else.

511
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:16,980
Spare my brother
and I'll give you the name of a witch.

512
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,202
Now, that...

513
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,451
...is worth something.

514
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,838
Tell them what you told me.

515
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:47,302
She can climb the tallest trees.
She can run faster than all the girls.

516
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,593
She wears a red cloak.
The devil's color.

517
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:54,138
That's nonsense. I made that cloak.

518
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,853
- Silence!
- Continue.

519
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,226
And she can talk to Werewolves.

520
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:07,068
I've seen it. With my own eyes.

521
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:15,413
- Do you deny it?
- No, I don't deny it.

522
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:24,260
And what was the nature
of this conversation?

523
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:28,298
It promised to leave Daggerhorn
in peace as long as I go with it.

524
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:36,264
The wolf is someone in this village
who wants you, Valerie.

525
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,601
Do you know who it is?

526
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,945
I'd think very hard if I were you.

527
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,486
Tell me.

528
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,072
Tell me who it is.

529
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,286
Give me a name.

530
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,423
It wants her, not you.

531
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,803
If you wish to save yourselves,
simply give it what it wants.

532
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,680
You can't give her to the wolf.
That's human sacrifice.

533
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,809
We've all made sacrifices.

534
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,561
The trial is over.
Go back to your homes.

535
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,939
I said go home. All of you!

536
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:29,237
- I thought you cared about her.
- I do care.

537
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,948
I do care.

538
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,580
I'm trying to be smart about it.

539
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,491
Go to the granary.

540
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,458
You're gonna try and rescue her?

541
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,344
- Well, I'll help.
- I'm not that desperate.

542
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:54,262
Oh, really? Then what's your plan, huh?

543
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,220
See, you don't have one.

544
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,143
Look, you've seen those locks.

545
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:04,526
I've got a shop and I've got tools.
You need me.

546
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,947
Okay. Fine.

547
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:13,444
But if you're the wolf,
I'm gonna chop your head off.

548
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,700
I will do the same to you.

549
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,873
Fair enough.

550
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,455
Go home!

551
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,127
Where's my brother? Father Solomon
told me you'd release him.

552
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,840
We did.

553
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,927
Grandma.

554
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,933
Bread. Blanket.

555
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,772
Do you need anything else?

556
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,359
I do not want you to use that knife.

557
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,449
- We have to find the wolf.
- By Sundown?

558
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:43,459
Listen, the wolf wants you.
But first it killed your sister.

559
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:49,590
No. I didn't know it,
but Lucie was in love with Henry.

560
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:53,252
And when she found out
about my engagement...

561
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,716
...she gave herself to the wolf.

562
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,632
No. Lucie wouldn't do that.

563
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:02,473
- Your time is up.
- But she might have responded to Henry.

564
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,516
Please see that she gets that.

565
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,072
Oaf.

566
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,382
Cesaire.

567
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,176
I'm gonna save your daughter.
And then I intend to marry her.

568
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,304
I'd like your blessing in this,
but I can live without it.

569
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:46,513
What can I do?

570
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,324
[KNocKING ON Doom

571
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,194
We're closed.

572
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,953
It's me.

573
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,914
Hello, Henry.

574
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,409
- I brought you some biscuits.
- Thanks.

575
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:15,376
I just wanna thank you
for speaking up this morning.

576
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,757
Here, try some.

577
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,848
Yes.

578
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,184
That was very brave of you.

579
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,477
I said what I felt.

580
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,813
You know...

581
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:34,441
...I want you to know you're under no
obligation to stand up for Valerie.

582
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,738
You're no longer engaged to her.

583
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,569
She's in love with someone else.

584
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:41,076
That doesn't mean
I've stopped caring about her.

585
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,075
I imagine that's just how
Lucie felt about you.

586
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,952
She had a crush on me.

587
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:51,666
Oh, more than a crush. I think she would
have done absolutely anything for you.

588
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:56,254
Even agree to meet you on a wolf night
if you asked her to.

589
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,935
Why are you doing this?

590
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:14,189
Do you think I'm the wolf?
Are you accusing me of murder?

591
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,730
I'm not accusing you of anything.

592
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,445
I just want to find out the truth.

593
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,828
It's you.

594
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:29,624
My God, it's you.
I can smell it on you.

595
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,706
Heh. What can you smell on me?

596
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:36,624
The night my father died, I could smell
the wolf. It was like a deep musk.

597
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,543
And I can smell it all over you right now.

598
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:44,215
What do you do out there in that cabin
all by yourself in the middle of the night?

599
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,133
On the night that Lucie died?

600
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,594
You don't know, do you?

601
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:59,317
I know what you're doing. And I'm not
gonna let you turn this on me.

602
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,377
Oh.

603
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,997
You're coming with us.

604
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:10,551
- I haven't done anything.
- Just a precaution.

605
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,395
Father Solomon doesn't want
any trouble from the witch's family.

606
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:26,199
It's time to put on your harlot's robe.

607
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,593
Valerie.

608
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,852
I did my best to protect you.

609
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,596
You and Lucie.

610
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,230
I know, Papa.

611
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,268
You taught us to be strong.

612
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:20,454
Father Solomon had designed
the mask for public disgrace.

613
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,967
And even my friends stared, judging me.

614
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:27,878
Stop.

615
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,591
What if they were right?

616
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,136
Maybe the wolf knew something I didn't.

617
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,101
Maybe there was something
dark inside of me.

618
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:38,305
You should all go home!

619
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:50,901
I'm so sorry, Valerie.

620
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,320
I didn't mean for this to happen.

621
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,489
Bless you, my dear.

622
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:06,628
Prudence.

623
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,293
Valerie?

624
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:12,130
Roxanne wanted me
to tell you how sorry she is.

625
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:16,768
- She said those things to save her brother.
- I know. Tell her that I forgive her.

626
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,223
Of course.

627
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,014
But I wanted to say ....

628
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:23,479
I don't know what to say.

629
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,606
But you don't have to say anything.

630
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,025
But I want to.

631
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,198
I want you to know that...

632
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,868
...you may have fooled Roxanne...

633
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,700
...but you don't fool me.

634
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,287
Not anymore.

635
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,702
You were always too good.

636
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,378
Too pretty.

637
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,881
Too perfect.

638
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,506
You tricked us.

639
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,057
Now you're gonna get what you deserve.

640
01:08:57,342 --> 01:09:00,061
Prudence, I think you should go.

641
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,687
Yes.

642
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,516
It won't be long now.

643
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,102
The wolf is coming.

644
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,368
The wolf lives here.

645
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,076
Your neighbor. Your best friend.
Even your wife.

646
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,911
You're the pretty one.

647
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,997
- I could eat you up.
- You will be happy again.

648
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,753
Human eyes, dark brown.

649
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,129
I know you well.

650
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:46,770
Do you know how you kill a tiger,
Father Auguste?

651
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,903
You tie out your best goat...

652
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,944
...and wait.

653
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,501
Fire!

654
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,513
- Put it out!
- Unh.

655
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,516
Go!

656
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,530
I'm gonna get you out of here.

657
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,875
It's too much!

658
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,702
Don't move.

659
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,427
There! He's taken the bait! Fire!

660
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:26,892
Wait, that's not the wolf!

661
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,519
He's aiding a witch!

662
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,189
- Fire!
- No!

663
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:33,395
Run!

664
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,402
Run.

665
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:00,760
This one started the fire.

666
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,762
Lock him up. In the elephant!

667
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:04,968
- Go!
- Move it!

668
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,849
The witch has escaped!

669
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,908
Get over here! Find the witch!

670
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,704
Come on, Peter's meeting us
with the horses.

671
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,628
Valerie!

672
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:49,347
Valerie!

673
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,560
Where's Peter?

674
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,645
I don't know.

675
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,523
He said he'd be here.

676
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:03,155
If he doesn't show...

677
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:05,859
...I'm gonna take you away.

678
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:08,278
Let me take you away.

679
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:14,033
Do you think I'm the wolf?

680
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:17,541
Find the witch!

681
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:22,083
Come on! Quickly!

682
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,140
Go.

683
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:31,217
That way!

684
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,513
We should go to the church.

685
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,722
The wolf can't cross onto holy ground.

686
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:41,068
Some with me! This way! Let's go!

687
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:52,364
I heard something over there.

688
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:59,120
They're in here! After them!

689
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,467
Valerie.

690
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:16,683
Henry. Henry.

691
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:17,893
Go. Valerie, go!

692
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,352
No. I'm not leaving you.

693
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:32,449
- We claim sanctuary.
- You are not on holy ground yet.

694
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:34,948
- This...
- Unh.

695
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,084
...belongs to me.

696
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,229
You want her alive?!

697
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,023
Kill it!

698
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,794
Valerie.

699
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,250
Step across the gate,
or I'll destroy this village.

700
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:31,759
Come with me before the sun rises.

701
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,976
Make your decision.

702
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:40,187
I won't let you destroy my home.

703
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,522
- I'll go with you.
- Don't! Valerie. No.

704
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,607
If you promise to leave them alone.

705
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,273
No. I won't let you
sacrifice yourself for us.

706
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:55,031
- Nor will I.
- Nor will I.

707
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,867
I stand by Valerie.

708
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,129
You can't hide from me.

709
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,683
- Aah!
- The witch will still burn!

710
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,690
Under the Blood Moon...

711
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:31,188
...a man bitten is a man cursed.

712
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,360
My children will be orphaned.

713
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,824
My brother...

714
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:43,918
...had children too.

715
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,754
I meant only to serve.

716
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:52,259
To protect us from darkness.

717
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,360
Under the Blood Moon...

718
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,443
...a man bitten is a man cursed.

719
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,460
Where's Peter?

720
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,013
Where's Peter?

721
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,415
Grandmother.

722
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:15,584
What big eyes you have.

723
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:20,173
The better to see you with, my dear.

724
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:29,182
Grandmother, what big ears you have.

725
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:33,854
The better to hear you with, my dear.

726
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:38,194
What big teeth you have.

727
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:43,033
The better to eat you with, my dear.

728
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,219
Valerie. What are you doing out of bed?

729
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,563
I was so worried.

730
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,022
It looks much better.

731
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:26,363
Where are you going?

732
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:30,910
To Grandmother's.
I think she's in danger.

733
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:11,917
We're going after the wolf
before the storm can cover its tracks.

734
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:15,455
It'll be human again
and we can finally kill it.

735
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,627
And I have ....

736
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,963
What? Tell me.

737
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,295
Peter is still missing.

738
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,223
I'll do what I have to do.

739
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,268
Please be careful.

740
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,436
Valerie.

741
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:21,813
Thank God you're all right.

742
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:31,538
Where were you?

743
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:34,041
I was trapped in that brazen beast all night.

744
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,501
I finally broke out.

745
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:38,708
Don't come near me.

746
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,589
Valerie, what?

747
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:43,046
You don't believe me?

748
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,048
I'll hurt you.

749
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,384
No, you won't.

750
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:53,848
Please don't.

751
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:27,424
Grandmother!

752
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,011
Grandmother, are you all right?

753
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,021
I had a nightmare.

754
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,608
- Ah!
- I'm fine.

755
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,649
I just woke up.

756
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,902
There's some soup if you're hungry.

757
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:59,289
- I think the wolf is out there.
- It's all right, darling. We're safe in here.

758
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,670
Eat up. Remember:

759
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:05,082
- "All sorrows are less with bread."
- "Less with bread."

760
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,802
That's right.

761
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:11,050
Eat up, my dear.

762
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,632
What is this?

763
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:30,528
Father, what are you doing here?

764
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:32,576
Where's Grandmother?

765
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:34,657
I had no choice.

766
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:41,995
She finally realized what I am.

767
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,464
How could you do this?

768
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,177
Sit down.

769
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,510
Sit down.

770
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,316
Oh, Valerie.

771
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:06,772
I've been so disrespected.

772
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:09,188
I've settled for far less than I deserve.

773
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,024
So I decided I'd leave.

774
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:15,994
For the city.

775
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,127
For richer hunting grounds.

776
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:26,212
Why didn't you just leave?

777
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,045
Because I loved you girls.

778
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,377
I wanted you to come with me.

779
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:34,216
- But you had to wait for the Blood Moon.
- Yes.

780
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,382
By birthright...

781
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,844
...the gift would go first
to my eldest daughter.

782
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:42,559
So I forged a letter.

783
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,565
But when I tried to speak to her--

784
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:46,941
Henry's not coming, Lucie.

785
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,817
--She didn't understand me.

786
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:57,236
Any offspring of mine with my wolf blood
would've been able to do so.

787
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,406
And then it all made sense.

788
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,793
Lucie couldn't be my daughter.
Your mother lied to me.

789
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,750
But you knew that already, didn't you?

790
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,876
After all these years of being so clever
and so careful, I just lost control.

791
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,086
I'm sorry for Lucie.

792
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:16,880
You took revenge on Mother.

793
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:19,345
And her lover.

794
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,686
Henry smelled the wolf that night.

795
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,103
And then again yesterday.

796
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:35,278
He thought the smell
came from your grandmother.

797
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:41,205
But she had lived
with that smell her whole life.

798
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:48,250
You see, my father was a wolf too.

799
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,915
The smell remained on his clothing.

800
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:55,674
Mother never knew what it meant...

801
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,386
...till the moment she died.

802
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,222
I loved her.

803
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:10,564
Her and Lucie both.
I never wanted to hurt them.

804
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:14,442
Valerie, come with me.

805
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:16,982
It's the last day of the Blood Moon.

806
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:20,449
One bite, and you'll be like me.

807
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:23,038
I won't do what you do.

808
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:24,660
I can't.

809
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:26,996
Yes, you can, Valerie.

810
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:31,539
My blood already
courses through your veins.

811
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,462
It's a gift.

812
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:38,220
It's a gift my father gave to me
that now I can give to you.

813
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:41,973
I'm stronger than he was,
you'll be even stronger than me.

814
01:27:42,132 --> 01:27:43,429
Think about it.

815
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,345
We will be invincible.

816
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:51,691
There must be a God,
because you're the devil.

817
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:55,691
And you're the devil's daughter.

818
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,989
You're not so terrifying
when the sun is up.

819
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,033
How would you know?

820
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:28,937
Papa!

821
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:31,890
I have something for you.

822
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:19,571
Peter.

823
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:22,612
Get me out of here.

824
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:27,283
OW.

825
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,292
He bit me.

826
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,302
When the moon rises...

827
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:46,969
...I'll be like him.

828
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:51,728
A beast.

829
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:04,949
Everything I knew was ripped apart.

830
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,286
I saw it all differently.

831
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,995
All the lies. My mother's, my father's.

832
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:17,045
He was all I had left.

833
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:19,498
Peter.

834
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,334
Even when I doubted him...

835
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,720
...even when I hurt him...

836
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,515
...Peter was true.

837
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:45,073
I'm so sorry.

838
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,583
No one can know about your father.

839
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:20,710
They'll hang you...

840
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:23,296
...for being the daughter of the wolf.

841
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:27,978
Peter.

842
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:32,532
I have to leave.

843
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,068
You won't be safe with me...

844
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:37,909
...until I learn how to protect you from....

845
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,527
I'll wait for you.

846
01:34:14,691 --> 01:34:16,034
I thought you'd say that.

847
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:45,225
It was the most brutal winter
I could remember.

848
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,937
Daggerhorn fell back
into its old rhythms.

849
01:34:48,433 --> 01:34:50,435
The wolf didn't come back.

850
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,775
But the village still lived in fear.

851
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:55,865
It was the only life they knew.

852
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:01,909
Henry found his courage.

853
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:07,290
He chose a life of honor;
protecting us from darkness.

854
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:16,136
With time, my mother realized that Father
would never return to Daggerhorn.

855
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:22,638
But I could no longer live there...

856
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:24,807
...with my secret.

857
01:35:25,305 --> 01:36:25,902
