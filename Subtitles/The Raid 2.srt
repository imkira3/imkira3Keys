00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,427
It's a question of ambition really.

5
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,144
Let me rephrase that.

6
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,581
It's a matter of limitation.

7
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,751
And the importance
of knowing yours.

8
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,501
Your boss, Tama.
He had a reputation, yes.

9
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,790
But he also knew where he stood,
understood how high he should climb.

10
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,301
That's why Bangun let
him be the man he was.

I'm a reasonable man.

Like you, I have ambitions.

15
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,949
But you see, in this world of ours,

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,990
it's really more of a "one
step at a time" kind of thing.

17
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,348
And you should have been
some fucking steps away

18
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,344

So...

25
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,791

full circle, ambition...

No, you have hearsay,
and a box of tapes.

67

But they're nothing compared
to what's coming for you.

I can provide safety for
your wife and child.

We can keep them out of
reach. But I need you.

Tama's job is to bribe everyone.

So, what's the next step?

133
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,822
Uco, Bangun's only child.

134
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,028
He's serving time in prison.

It will only be a few months.

139
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,580
You can't know where I am.

140
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,982
And I can't be seen
anywhere near you or Angga.

141
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,629
But if I don't do this,

142
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,306
I can't protect us this time.

143

Please understand.

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,902
This is the only
choice I have left.

Yes or no. Do you understand me?

150
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,987
So, what did he do?

151
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,741
What did he do?

152
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,223
Enough.

153
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,790
I need more than that.

154
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,627
He's the asshole son of
an asshole politician.

155
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,548
Can't you just put
me in, lock me up?

156
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,119
Why does this kid have to bleed?

157
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,861
His daddy is the reason
Uco is in prison.

158

If we're talking
earning credibility,

159
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,781
doing this puts you
immediately on his radar.

160
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,740
At the very least, it gives you
two something to talk about.

161
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,503
If you really want
me to beat him up,

162
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,869
I mean really beat him up,
I need a better reason.

163
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,588
He's also a major benefactor...

1142

New faces. New prices.

New prices?

1144
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:43,071
Come on, Reza.

1145
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:46,064
Just think of it as
a probation period.

1146
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:49,828
How much did Goto pay you?

1147
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:52,746
That's not a smart question to ask.

1148
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:55,870
Oh, yeah, and why's that?

1149
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:59,422
Because I'm meeting you, not him.

1150
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:01,543
Now think up a number.

1151
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:05,227
If it keeps me here after
dinner, then it's enough. Hm?

Hey, sidekick.

1153

You're talkative.

1157
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:29,148
He escaped from the car.

1158
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:34,030
Put the word out.

1159
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:36,660
Whoever finds him will be...

1160
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:38,310
He's here.

1161
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:40,383
He's coming up.

1162
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:45,310
- Then hold him off.
- Yes, boss.

1163
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:48,546
Everything okay?

1164

don't worry.
