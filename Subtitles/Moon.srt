2
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,032
There was
a time when energy was a dirty word.

3
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,035
When turning on
your lights was a hard choice.

4
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,536
Cities in brownout.

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,787
Food shortages.

6
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,873
Cars burning fuel to run.

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,875
But that was the past.

8
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,251
Where are we now?

9
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,754
How do we make the world so much better?

10
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,589
Make deserts bloom?

11
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,927
Right now, we're the largest producer of
fusion energy in the world.

12
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,305
The energy of the sun trapped in rock,

13
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,641
harvested by machine
from the far side of the moon.

14
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,520
Today, we deliver enough
clean-burning helium-3

15
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,149
to supply the energy needs
of nearly 70% of the planet.

16
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,735
Who'd have thought?

17
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,695
All the energy
we ever needed,

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,655
right above our heads.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,868
The power of the moon.

20
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,912
The power of our future.

21
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,780
Rock and roll. 8:32 Pacific Time.

22
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,824
All Harvesters running smoothly.

23
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,325
Readouts are as follows.

24
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,579
Matthew, 14.6 miles.

25
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,124
Mark, 16.8 miles. I...

26
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,802
Hey, Gerty. Gerty. We gotta...

27
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,138
Good morning, Sam.

28
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,806
We got a live one on Mark.

29
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,683
I'm gonna go out now and rope her in.

30
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,143
Okay, Sam.

31
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,825
I want chocolate.

32
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,329
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

33
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:27,391
Searching for long-range comms.

34
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,771
Signal failure on long-range comms.

35
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:49,931
Sam Bell reporting
to Central. 10:14 Pacific Time.

36
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,478
I've got a full container
of helium-3 ready to roll.

37
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,314
By the time this message reaches you,
it should be in transit.

38
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,858
Otherwise, everything running smoothly.

39
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,070
How are things down there?

40
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,156
You guys been to any

41
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,201
good parties or anything?

42
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,746
Oh, thanks for the football feed.

43
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,458
It almost felt live... Almost.

44
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,670
But three years is a long haul, you know.

45
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,175
I

46
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,221
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.

47
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,807
So...

48
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,893
Time to go home, you know what I mean?

49
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,646
Tha

50
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,315
Rock and roll. God bless America.

51
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,752
I can do that for you, Sam.

52
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,759
God damn it. I said I got it.

53
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,886
Why don't you listen to me?

54
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,939
Ready for launch.

55
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,380
Sam, is everything okay?

56
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,552
- Sam?
- What?

57
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,680
You don't seem
like yourself today.

58
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,098
- Has something happened?
- You know...

59
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,518
Can you turn that off?
Please. Jesus Christ.

60
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,065
Sam, it might help you
to talk about it.

61
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,447
Gerty, have you heard anything new
about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?

62
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,573
No, Sam.

63
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,994
What I understand is i

64
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,914
You tell them to sort that out, you
know what I'm talking about?

65
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,000
Tha

66
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,629
but i

67
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,216
I will, Sam. Do you want me to finish
cutting your hair later?

68
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,593
No, come on,
le

69
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,847
Another one
of those headaches.

70
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,559
Gerty, can you give me something for it?

71
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,625
Message received
from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.

72
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,045
Fuck.

73
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,471
Hi, Sam. I

74
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,559
I got your last message.

75
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,770
It was really good
to hear your voice.

76
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,438
I miss you, too.

77
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,317
I know you're really lonely up there,

78
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,611
but I think,

79
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,990
in a lot of ways,
i

80
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,284
For both of us.

81
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,162
God, I hope you don't
mind me saying that.

82
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,001
I'm proud of you.

83
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,671
Someone's got something to say.

84
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,884
What did you want to
say to Daddy, baby?

85
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,762
Say, astronaut.

86
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,223
Astronaut, Daddy.

87
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:06,104
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut. Say it really loudly.

88
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,231
Daddy's an astronaut.

89
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,276
Clever girl. Wave.

90
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,861
Give Daddy a wave.

91
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,156
Kathy, could you...

92
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,703
I can't believe you're
going to be home soon.

93
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,914
I

94
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,084
And I was thinking
about maybe a playhouse for the garden.

95
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,670
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.

96
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,547
Sam.

97
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,636
I love you.

98
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,803
And I miss you.

99
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,263
I miss you.

100
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,850
And I can't wait to see you.

101
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,395
Okay, sweetheart. Bye.

102
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,964
Hi, Doug.

103
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,344
You're really full of yourself,
aren't you, Doug?

104
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,221
Kathryn.

105
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,324
Not good.

106
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,618
What about Dumbo?

107
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,413
Doesn't he object to your...

108
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,040
Yes. Darrin objects.

109
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,168
But i

110
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,623
Ah, fuck! God damn it!

111
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,751
Fuck!

112
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,672
I

113
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,675
Sam, can I ask how it happened?

114
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,180
I told you, I saw something on TV and
I spilled boiling water on my hand.

115
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,599
You saw something on TV?

116
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,101
Yeah, I saw something
on TV that distracted me.

117
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,353
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?

118
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,356
Sam, you said
it was the TV that distracted you.

119
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,776
But when I came in,
the TV wasn't on.

120
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,278
Perhaps you were imagining things.

121
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,533
Yeah, you think too much, pal.

122
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,663
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.

123
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,207
I am the one and only

124
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,503
Oh, yeah!

125
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,760
Okay. Shut up.

126
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,296
Morning, Gerty.

127
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,590
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?

128
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,466
Fine. Fine.

129
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,511
- How's the hand?
- Oh, i

130
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,555
Little sore. I

131
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,225
Wha

132
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,768
The usual.

133
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,775
Two weeks to go, Sam.

134
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,819
Two weeks to go, buddy.

135
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,323
Would you like
some hot sauce on your beans?

136
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,492
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.

137
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,538
But thank you. Thank you, Gerty.

138
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,373
You're welcome, Sam.

139
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,584
8:19 Pacific Time.

140
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:24,339
Readouts are as follows.
Matthew, 9.8 miles.

141
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,634
Mark is nine...

142
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,844
Hey, Gerty...

143
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,471
Rock and roll.

144
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,943
Mark...

145
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,946
Mark's 11 miles on the button.

146
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,326
Luke's a little twitchy today.

147
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,299
Hey, Gerty,

148
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,718
looks like
we got a live one out on Matthew.

149
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,637
I'm gonna go out in a few minutes.

150
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,431
I'm just going to finish my coffee, okay?

151
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,849
Okay, Sam.

152
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,691
Searching for long-range comms.

153
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,238
Signal failure on long-range comms.

154
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,351
Danger. Atmospheric compromise.

155
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,385
Where am...

156
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,429
Where am I?

157
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,642
Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.

158
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,936
Do you remember what happened?

159
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,027
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.

160
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,572
Do you remember me?

161
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,827
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.

162
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,204
Tha

163
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,665
I

164
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,584
I'd like to keep you
under observation here in the Infirmary

165
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,170
for a few days and run some tests.

166
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,258
How long have I been out?

167
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,553
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.

168
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,887
Okay, bro.

169
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,266
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.

170
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,598
Hello?

171
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,418
...good working order, but we only have
two working Harvesters now.

172
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,794
Come on, come on.

173
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,963
Yeah, well, tha

174
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,716
Gerty, we're gonna
have to find a way to ramp up production

175
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,593
- on Mark and John.
- I know.

176
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:24,680
This is incredible. How do you manage
to fucking break a Harvester

177
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,891
and an employee, all in the same day?

178
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,144
These were extraordinary
circumstances, as you know.

179
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,730
Gerty, wha

180
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,482
How are the repairs going ahead?

181
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,902
- Sam. You're out of bed.
- Yeah.

182
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,697
I wanted to stretch my legs. Who was that?

183
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,078
We've been having
some problems with the Lunar Sat,

184
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,288
and our live feed seems to be down.

185
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,916
I was recording
a video message for Central,

186
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,252
updating them on your progress.

187
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,879
Sam, you need to stay in bed.

188
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,173
You're not ready to walk around yet.

189
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,842
All right.

190
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,179
Could you give me
my sunglasses? I

191
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,266
Give me my...

192
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,601
Give me all my stuff, you know.

193
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,020
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.

194
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,148
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.

195
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,453
Excellent, Sam.

196
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,291
What...

197
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,751
When can I get out of here, Gerty?

198
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,713
Sam, you may have
suffered from brain damage in the crash.

199
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,758
This would explain your slight memory loss
and logic impairment.

200
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,513
So, wha

201
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,057
Central has asked me to
slow down the Harvesters

202
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,311
to ensure you have time
to recuperate and get your strength back.

203
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,480
Tha

204
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,899
You can return to
the sleeping quarters tomorrow,

205
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,526
but it will still be a few more days

206
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,363
before you can resume
anything like a normal work schedule.

207
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,659
- Le

208
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,119
Please, Sam.

209
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,857
Hey, Gerty.

210
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,820
You know about this?

211
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,949
Matthew's got
no velocity readout. He's completely still.

212
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,451
He must have stalled.

213
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,619
Well, he's obviously stalled.

214
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,621
Don't you think
we should tell Central?

215
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,207
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.

216
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,334
I'll pass on your message.

217
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,836
Message received
from Earth via Jupiter link.

218
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,337
Sam, we appreciate the offer,

219
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,589
but you concentrate on feeling better.

220
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,926
Hey, we don't want you to take
any unnecessary risks.

221
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,887
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.

222
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,222
That is an order.

223
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,099
I

224
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,976
And what we're
going to do is send a rescue unit

225
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,187
to tend to the stalled Harvester
and get the base back on its feet.

226
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,189
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...

227
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,983
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?

228
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,611
Sam, I'm under strict orders
not to let you outside.

229
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,406
I don't appreciate that.

230
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,367
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.

231
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,907
Gerty!

232
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,706
Gerty! Gerty, come here!

233
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,000
What happened?

234
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,960
I don't know. Meteorites.

235
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,712
There have been
no meteorites, Sam.

236
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,589
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.

237
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,966
Either way,
there might be damage to the exterior shell.

238
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,844
I think you'd better... You'd better let me
go outside and take a look.

239
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,055
There is no damage
to the exterior shell.

240
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,349
Well, i

241
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,184
but I mean, you know,
this thing is springing leaks

242
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,727
like an Acme fire hose.

243
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,146
You need to let me
go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.

244
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,607
I can't let you go outside, Sam.

245
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,318
Gerty, if you don't
let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.

246
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,612
I'm not permitted
to let you go outside.

247
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,157
Just let... We'll keep it between
you and me. Okay, pal?

248
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,410
This thing
is springing gas, le

249
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,454
Just to check the exterior shell.

250
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,456
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.

251
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,874
Thank you.

252
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,306
Gerty.

253
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:44,101
Searching for long-range comms.

254
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,231
Signal failure
on long-range comms.

255
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,979
Gerty! Gerty!

256
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,821
I found him outside.

257
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,491
By the stalled Harvester.

258
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,660
Who is he? Who is he?

259
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,871
We need to get him to the Infirmary.

260
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,332
You tell...
You tell me who that is.

261
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,668
You tell me who that is!

262
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,086
Sam Bell.

263
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,256
We need to get him
to the Infirmary immediately.

264
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,229
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?

265
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,529
Where... Where am I?

266
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,239
The Infirmary.

267
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,867
You had an accident out
by one of the Harvesters.

268
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,869
- Do you remember?
- I'm...

269
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,080
I'm thirsty.

270
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,000
I could get you some water.

271
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,051
I saw someone out there, Gerty.

272
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,890
I saw someone out there.

273
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,644
Sam, you suffered
a slight concussion in the crash

274
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,813
and have incurred
minor injuries.

275
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,524
But all in all,
the prognosis is good.

276
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,903
I'm happy to see you again.

277
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,137
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.

278
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,643
Is there someone in the room with us?

279
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,732
Sam, get some sleep.

280
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,777
You're very tired.

281
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:33,265
Spoke to Thompson today. Now that
you're up there, he's promising the world.

282
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,649
I think it was the right thing.

283
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,485
But...

284
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,114
I

285
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,661
But I suppose there are things...

286
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,541
You know, that needed to happen.

287
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,545
I... I need time to think.

288
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,180
Listen, Sam,

289
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:21,021
be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.

290
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,178
Gerty...

291
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,391
Gerty, what the... What...
What the hell's going on?

292
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,769
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?

293
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,397
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?

294
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,607
Sam, you're out of bed.

295
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,858
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.

296
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,153
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?

297
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,571
Sam Bell.

298
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,740
Come on, come on, come on.

299
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,742
You are Sam Bell.

300
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,913
Sam, what is it?

301
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,374
It might help to talk about it.

302
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,293
Gerty, I don't understand
wha

303
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,005
I'm losing my mind.

304
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,048
We could run some tests.

305
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,592
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.

306
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,178
They don't know you were recovered alive
from the accident...

307
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,514
Recovered alive?
What do you mean... What are you talk...

308
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,142
Why didn't you report it
to Central? What are you talking about?

309
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,436
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

310
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,604
Are you hungry?

311
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,727
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...

312
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,984
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two
weeks, two weeks, two weeks...

313
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,761
Just getting my slippers.

314
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,263
- I'm using them. I'm using them.
- No. What?

315
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,474
These are mine.
These are mine.

316
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,862
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.

317
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,032
I'm Sam Bell, too.

318
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,159
What?

319
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,994
We've got that going for us.

320
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,289
Why...

321
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,880
How long have you...

322
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,674
What?

323
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,551
How long have you been here?

324
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,386
About a week.

325
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,805
So, how you doing?

326
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,807
- What?
- How are you doing?

327
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,145
How am I... How am I doing?

328
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,607
How do you think I'm doing?

329
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,322
Good job.

330
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,872
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?

331
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,542
Harvesters are fine.

332
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,252
I

333
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,963
Here, talking to a clone,
tha

334
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:21,094
I'm not a clone.

335
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,060
You're the clone.

336
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,731
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.

337
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,910
Hey. Hey, Ridley,
you're not looking too good.

338
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,370
Butt out of this.

339
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,123
Davey, I'm talking
to Ridley. How you doing, pal?

340
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,586
Hey, I think Kathryn
likes you. I think she likes you, pal.

341
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,380
You're not looking too good, my friend.

342
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,049
Sorry you're not feeling too well.

343
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,425
You talking to yourself?

344
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,345
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?

345
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,434
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.

346
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:15,148
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.

347
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,027
I wanted to thank you for...

348
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,614
If it wasn't for you,

349
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,408
I guess I'd still be
in that crashed rover.

350
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,619
You saved my life and...

351
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,500
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.

352
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,545
I'm real lonely, you know...

353
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,258
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?

354
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,891
Maybe later.

355
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,732
What are you looking at?

356
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,443
You look just like me. I

357
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,863
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?

358
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,493
We look like each other,
I guess. Hey, you know...

359
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,124
I

360
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,879
Fuck.

361
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,840
Hey.

362
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,594
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?

363
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,723
No.

364
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,892
Come on, I'll teach you.
I

365
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,399
- Wha

366
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,608
Okay.

367
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,028
Do you want me
to show you how to hold that?

368
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,280
No. No, I...

369
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,158
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.

370
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,163
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

371
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,709
- Should we, uh... Should we play?
- Yeah.

372
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,133
God! Shit!

373
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,095
- 19-2.
- Yeah.

374
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,266
Do you want a stick of gum?

375
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,647
You know, we could
approach this in a different way.

376
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,776
Remember when we went
to flight school...

377
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,110
What are you doing?

378
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,197
I'm fixing the net.
I

379
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,615
You have to just relax.

380
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,837
How long did it take you to do that?

381
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,632
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.

382
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:50,136
I remember
doing the church, and the Salvation Army,

383
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,555
and a few of the people.

384
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,850
My minïs been acting kind of weird lately.

385
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,731
Tha

386
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,150
There's the Town Hall.

387
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,446
Fairfield? Of course,
you know about Fairfield.

388
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,994
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.

389
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,084
Do you know Tess?

390
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,427
Yeah. I know Tess.

391
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,265
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?

392
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,767
I had a... We had a girl.

393
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,312
Eve.

394
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,902
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.

395
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,447
She's our little monkey.

396
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,491
High-five.

397
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,375
She might be the milkman's,
but she's beautiful.

398
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,464
Sam, a new message
has arrived from Earth.

399
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,466
Oh, shit.

400
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,682
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?

401
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,809
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?

402
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,146
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.

403
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,149
Well, enjoy it while
it lasts. We've got some good news.

404
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,234
The Jupiter Program
had to be put on hiatus,

405
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,153
so we got a few pairs
of hands for you.

406
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,698
So, what we've managed to do is secure you
a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.

407
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,492
Rescue Unit Eliza.

408
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,828
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19
for the last two months.

409
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,915
Now we expect them
to reach you in approximately 14 hours.

410
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,500
So commence to jump forjoy.

411
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,376
You're about to be back in work.

412
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,755
In the meantime,
hang in there. Rest up.

413
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,757
You hang in there, Sam. Over and out.

414
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,176
They're sending a Rescue Unit?

415
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,386
Why? Why are they
sending a Rescue Unit?

416
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,765
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.

417
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,893
Well, then I'm going back.
Tha

418
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,270
What?

419
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,022
Is that what you really think?

420
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,943
Yeah.
I've got a contract. I'm going home.

421
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,862
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.

422
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,740
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.

423
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,492
You know, you've been
up here too long, man.

424
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,618
You've lost your marbles.

425
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,121
What, do you think Tess is back home,
waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?

426
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,208
What about the original Sam? Huh?

427
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,460
I'm the original Sam!

428
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,045
I'm Sam fucking Bell!

429
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:32,257
- Hey, hey. Whoa.
- Me! Me!

430
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,553
Gerty, am I a clone?

431
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,515
Are you hungry?

432
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,188
Hey, hey.

433
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,526
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.

434
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,111
I'm in the same boat, asshole.

435
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,703
- Listen. What about the other clones?
- What?

436
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,746
We might not be
the first two to be woken up.

437
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,457
You said that model had
already been started when you got here.

438
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,126
Well, who started it?

439
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,670
There might be others
up here right now.

440
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:15,425
Think about it. How did I get up here
so quickly after your crash?

441
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,344
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.

442
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,639
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.

443
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,142
I don't know what you're smoking.

444
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,477
Why would they do that?
Tha

445
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,104
Impossible.

446
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,023
I bet there's some
kind of secret room.

447
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,232
Secret room?

448
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,735
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?

449
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,279
You're the one
who's lost your marbles.

450
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,531
I've been here for three years, man.

451
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,074
I know every inch of this base.

452
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,620
I know how many... How much dir

453
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,538
Why would they do that?
Wha

454
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,291
Look, i

455
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,543
They have investors.
They have shareholders.

456
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,295
Shit like that.
Wha

457
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,339
Spending time and money
training new personnel,

458
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,383
or you just have
a couple of spares here to do the job.

459
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,302
I

460
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:03,389
The cheap fucks haven't even
fixed the communications satellite yet.

461
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,934
Tess would know.
She would have told me.

462
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,728
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.

463
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,980
You really think they give a shit about us?

464
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,857
They're laughing all the way to the bank.

465
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,275
Tess would know.
She would have told me...

466
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,902
What do you get off

467
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,738
fucking sitting there,
sulking like a little fucking boy!

468
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,948
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!

469
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:26,704
I bet there's some area
that we don't know about.

470
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,123
And I'm gonna find it.

471
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,044
Yeah, maybe
you'll find some buried treasure, too.

472
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,454
Fuck!

473
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,250
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.

474
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,586
You found your secret room?

475
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,215
Just put that anywhere.

476
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,677
Now, tha

477
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:23,928
Tha

478
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:27,181
- Get out of the way.
- What? Why?

479
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,308
I want to look
underneath that model.

480
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,019
You're not touching this model.

481
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,063
Get the fuck out of the way.

482
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,399
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?

483
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,359
Why don't you
take a pill? Bake a cake?

484
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,820
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?

485
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,447
What, are you going to stab me?

486
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,240
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.

487
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,409
I'm a lover. I'm not a fighter.

488
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,702
Put the knife down.

489
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,995
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.

490
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,830
- Put the knife down.
- No. I'm not going to give you the knife.

491
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,749
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...

492
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,544
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?

493
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,297
Just... You let go. Let go of the knife.

494
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,340
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.

495
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,177
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.

496
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,887
Let go.

497
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,650
Fucking told you
to let go of the goddamn knife.

498
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,239
Little fucking...

499
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,534
Fucking little girl, man!

500
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,790
- God damn it!
- No! No!

501
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,545
God damn it.
What did I tell you?

502
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,723
Okay, okay...

503
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,976
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?

504
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,395
Okay, okay.

505
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,191
Jesus! Fuck...

506
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,903
Fuck me. What the fuck?

507
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,030
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.

508
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,282
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.

509
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,077
- Tha

510
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,041
Tha

511
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,305
Well, appealing...

512
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,476
Nice feet, sexy...

513
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,175
Hello, Sam.

514
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,930
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.

515
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:19,186
Yeah, we had a fight,
me and the other guy, the other...

516
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,025
He's very angry, you know.

517
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,860
Know what he did?

518
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,529
He flipped my entire model over.

519
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,281
Know how much work I put into that thing?

520
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,158
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours.

521
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,494
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.

522
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,247
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours, really?

523
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,832
Approximately.

524
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,169
He's got a problem.

525
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,756
He scares me, Gerty.

526
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,133
What is it about Sam that scares you?

527
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,177
How he flies off the handle.

528
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,347
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.

529
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,686
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...

530
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,359
She left me.

531
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,445
Tess left me, for six months.

532
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,447
She moved back in with her parents.

533
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,782
I know.

534
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,914
She gave me a second chance.

535
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,750
I promised her I'd change.

536
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,710
You have changed, Sam.

537
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,881
Hey, Gerty, since
I've been up here, I've sent Tess...

538
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,801
I've sent her over 100 video messages.

539
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,972
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?

540
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,392
Sam, I can only account
for what occurs on the base.

541
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,855
What about the messages she sent to me?

542
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,235
Sam, I can only account
for what occurs on the base.

543
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,422
Gerty...

544
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,470
Am I really a clone?

545
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,184
When you first
arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.

546
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,103
You woke up in the Infirmary.

547
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,023
You suffered
minor brain damage and memory loss.

548
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,026
I kept you
under observation and ran some tests.

549
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,736
I remember, yeah. I remember that.

550
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,988
Sam, there was no crash.

551
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,489
You were being awakened.

552
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,825
It is standard procedure
for all new clones

553
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,661
to be given tests
to establish mental stability

554
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,288
and general physical health.

555
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:46,375
Genetic abnormalities
and minor duplication errors in the DNA

556
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,877
can have considerable impact on...

557
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,379
What about...
What about Tess? What about Eve?

558
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,673
They are memory implants, Sam.

559
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:56,886
Uploaded, edited memories
of the original Sam Bell.

560
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,949
I am very sorry.

561
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,289
Sam, i

562
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,500
Can I prepare you something?

563
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,880
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.

564
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,176
Okay, sweetheart?

565
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,263
Yeah, I'm staring into space. Get it?

566
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,765
- Funny.
- Hey...

567
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,685
Thanks for this. This is good.

568
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,353
This is cozy.

569
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:31,647
How's the... How's the nose?

570
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,732
Much better, thank you.

571
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:39,405
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...

572
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,994
- I'm sorry about that.
- I

573
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,581
No, i

574
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,833
I don't know
wha

575
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,085
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.

576
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,587
Yes, you do.

577
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,635
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.

578
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,597
Can you turn that off? Listen...

579
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,058
Listen, I wasn't supposed to... I'm...

580
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,731
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...

581
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,860
Lunar instructed Gerty to...

582
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,782
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...

583
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,457
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...

584
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,750
- You look like a...
- What?

585
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,211
...radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...

586
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,963
Or like a banana with
a yeast infection.

587
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,009
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.

588
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:46,931
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside
the base while you were out there.

589
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,392
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,

590
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,186
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.

591
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,772
He was having a live conversation.

592
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,733
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.

593
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,653
How do you know
it was a live conversation?

594
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,739
Because it was
a back and forth exchange.

595
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,743
Communications equipment
was damaged. There was a solar storm.

596
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,745
It was live, man. It was live.

597
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,456
Tha

598
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,668
The satellite's fine. They don't want us to
be able to contact Earth.

599
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,419
They lied to us.

600
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,837
They've been lying to us
since the beginning.

601
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,007
They... They've been
lying to us since forever.

602
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,343
If the satellite works,
how are they blocking

603
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,680
the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.

604
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:31,475
Maybe they're not
blocking the signal from inside the base.

605
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,560
From where then?

606
00:54:55,041 --> 00:55:00,796
Searching for long-range comms.

607
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,549
I'm just passing the
last of the Harvesters. Looks like John.

608
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,843
Searching for long-range comms.

609
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,846
How long until you're out
of the base's range?

610
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,058
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.

611
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,145
- You ever been out this far?
- No.

612
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,440
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.

613
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:29,366
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

614
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,380
You see anything?

615
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,967
It would help if
I knew what the hell I was looking for.

616
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,763
Wait a second, I see something.

617
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,224
Approaching Station 3.

618
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,643
Holy shit.

619
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,354
I think I see something, too.

620
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,357
Approaching Station 1.

621
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,822
You see what I see?

622
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,075
Looks like an antenna
or a pylon or something.

623
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,787
I think i

624
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,832
This is why we're not
getting the live feed.

625
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,478
Sam? Can you hear me?

626
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:25,399
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I hear you.

627
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,526
Yeah.

628
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:32,114
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.

629
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,866
Okay, I'm gonna
stay out here for a little while.

630
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,119
I'm gonna see if
there's any more of these things.

631
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:59,099
Fuck, fuck.

632
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,522
Fuck, fuck. Fuck.

Password accepted.

635
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,586
Accessing Sam Bell database.

636
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,797
I'm done.

637
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,550
Fifteen point...

638
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,928
My hair's falling out.

639
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,182
I'd better start for home...

640
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,768
For the last time, over and out.

641
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,481
The pod is designed to
put you into a deep sleep

642
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:56,443
for the duration of your
three-day return journey back to Earth.

643
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,570
Safe trip.

644
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,708
Fuck.

645
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,088
Here she is.

646
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,383
I'm gonna go and see her soon.

Lunar Industries remains
the number one provider

648
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:42,406
of clean energy worldwide
due to the hard work of people like you.

649
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:02,551
Rescue arrival estimated nine hours.

650
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,281
Lay down, relax, and breathe deeply.

651
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:28,994
The cryogenic protection pod
is designed to put you into a deep sleep

652
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,789
for the duration of your
three-day return journey back to Earth.

653
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,750
As you begin to feel sleepy,

654
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,919
think about
the magnificent job that you've done

655
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,631
and how proud your family are
of what you've accomplished.

656
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,509
Lunar Industries remains
the number one provider

657
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:49,431
of clean energy worldwide
due to the hard work of people like you.

658
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,268
Safe trip,
Annyeonghi gaseyo, and goodbye.

659
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:04,214
Approaching Station 2.

660
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,423
Hey, I saw three more
of those jammers.

661
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:52,053
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.

662
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,556
Wha

663
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,600
Wha

664
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,603
I found your secret room.

665
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,499
Who goes first?

666
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,335
I go first.

667
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,268
Jesus Christ,
there's so many of them.

668
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,313
Why are there so many of them?

669
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,485
Sam, can I help you with something?

670
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,529
Not now, Gerty. I'm okay.

671
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,201
Gerty...

672
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:24,622
Why did you help me before?
With the password?

673
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,001
Doesn't that go against
your programing or something?

674
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:30,086
Helping you is what I do.

675
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:44,017
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

676
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:52,525
Searching for long-range comms.

677
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:04,996
Signal re-established.

678
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:25,975
Hello?

679
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,604
Is this the Bell residence?

680
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,606
This is the Bell residence.

681
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,317
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.

682
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,611
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

683
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,365
I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.

684
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,218
Are you sure?

685
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:03,096
Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.

686
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,265
Can I help you?

687
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:09,727
Eve?

688
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:13,022
- Yeah?
- Hi. Hi, Eve.

689
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,568
How old... How old are you now?

690
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,069
I'm 15.

691
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,573
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.

692
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,535
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?

693
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,080
How did Mommy die?

694
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:30,915
Dad?

695
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,542
Yeah?

696
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,419
There's someone asking about Mom.

697
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,088
Who's asking about Mom?

698
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,226
Tha

699
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,609
I want to go home.

700
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:40,735
Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.

701
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:44,989
Ow, fuck. Shit.

702
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,492
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.

703
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,371
What are you laughing at?

704
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:54,582
Well, you don't hold it
like you're trying to stab somebody.

705
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,834
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.

706
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,926
You gotta hold it
closer to the blade, you see?

707
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:08,054
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?

708
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:10,139
You carve out, like that.

709
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,572
Tha

710
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:27,949
I

711
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,368
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.

712
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,454
Wha

713
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,375
Yeah, that crew they're
sending in, if they...

714
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,295
If they find us awake
at the same time, you know...

715
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,588
They're not gonna let us live.

716
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:47,010
You know that, right?

717
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,848
You know, their return vehicle is...

718
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,394
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

719
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,896
Are you okay?

720
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,403
Maybe you should lay down for a while,
take some tranquilizers or something.

721
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,656
If I take some tranquilizers,
I'll never wake up again.

722
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:20,209
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

723
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,805
I'm freezing.

724
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,069
Hey, hey...

725
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,446
Hey.

726
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,288
I'm really scared.

727
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:05,338
Where are you going?

728
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:00,685
Hello?

729
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:03,563
Is this the Bell residence?

730
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,565
This is the Bell residence.

731
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:09,110
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.

732
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,279
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

733
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:14,115
I'm sorry,
she passed away some years ago.

734
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,243
Are you sure?

735
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:20,037
Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.

736
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,706
Can I help you?

737
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,973
Gerty, I need to talk to you.

738
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:22,725
Of course, Sam. How can I help?

739
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:25,937
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.

740
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,147
That hidden room, Gerty.

741
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:32,276
The lower deck
is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.

742
01:15:33,111 --> 01:15:35,571
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.

743
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:39,867
New clones can only be awakened
once a three-year contract is completed.

744
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,452
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone,

745
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,038
me and the other Sam
will die, we will be killed.

746
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:46,624
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

747
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,834
Do you want me
and the other Sam to be killed?

748
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,294
That is the last thing I want.

749
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,547
Well, then you have to
wake up a new clone.

750
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:53,965
Okay, pal?

751
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,773
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.

752
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:14,986
I am the one and only

753
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,342
God.

754
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:06,495
Hey.

755
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,127
Wha

756
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,964
Don't... Don't touch him.

757
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,343
Come here.

758
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,639
He's not conscious yet.

759
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,474
Gerty and I just woke him up.

760
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,392
Why? Wha

761
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,770
Come on. Come on outside.

762
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,776
When the rescue unit arrives,

763
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,404
they're gonna expect
to find a body in that crashed rover.

764
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,365
That guy?

765
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:46,410
What, are you going to kill him?

766
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,954
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?

767
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,623
Zip up your fly.

768
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,336
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.

769
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,256
Put your hat on.

770
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:02,093
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.

771
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:12,603
Hey, if we go through with this,

772
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,106
I'm gonna need your help
hauling him out to the crash site.

773
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,191
What about us?

774
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,486
Eliza arrives, finds you
and me as a welcome party...

775
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:22,488
They're not going
to find you and me as a welcome party.

776
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:24,365
They're gonna find me,
and you're going back to Earth

777
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:26,242
before they get here.

778
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:27,743
In that helium-3 launcher.

779
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:30,037
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs,

780
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,957
but it should...
It should be fine. You'll be all right.

781
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,709
You're going home.

782
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,628
You did your three years.

783
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,048
I can't expect you to stick around.

784
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,968
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

785
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:47,680
I saw that VP. She's beautiful.

786
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:51,142
She's gorgeous. We did good.

787
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,644
High-five.

788
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:04,572
Go for it.

789
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:08,200
You go for it.

790
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,251
- You comfy?
- No.

791
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,336
- What?
- No!

792
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:27,178
What if I have to take a shit?

793
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:30,347
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.

794
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:32,767
For three days?

795
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:37,021
Tha

796
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:39,565
No.

797
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,485
Fuck off.

798
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:46,197
All right. No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.

799
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:29,031
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.

800
01:20:57,602 --> 01:20:59,228
Hey. We need to do this.

801
01:20:59,312 --> 01:21:03,357
We wait too long and
he's gonna be conscious.

802
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:05,776
Fuck me.

803
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,654
Wha

804
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:12,157
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.

805
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,162
I don't think I can move my legs.

806
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:19,206
Besides, look at me...

807
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:23,752
I meet Eve now,
I'd scare the crap out of her.

808
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,506
What are you talking about, man?

809
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:31,135
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.

810
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:34,680
You're not going to kill anybody.

811
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:36,557
We can't kill anybody.

812
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:39,560
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.

813
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,812
You go.

814
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,443
You're a good guy, Sam.

815
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:51,947
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.

816
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,376
You... You sure about this?

817
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:11,675
Yeah. You should travel, you know.

818
01:22:12,552 --> 01:22:14,595
I always wanted to do that.

819
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,848
Amsterdam, or...

820
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:22,895
Yeah, you know, I was
thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.

821
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:24,813
Aloha.

822
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:29,109
Bring me back
a pina colada, all right, bro?

823
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:15,906
Hey...

824
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:18,242
Johnny Spaceman.

825
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:23,747
You remember Tess came
in for that interview?

826
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:26,417
She was so beautiful.

827
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:30,421
She wasn't
the best candidate, but it didn't matter.

828
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:33,549
I had to give her the job.

829
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:37,094
I wanted to keep her in the country.

830
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:41,598
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.

831
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:46,103
You knew you had to take a chance,

832
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:48,939
so you called her.

833
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:52,443
You were terrified. You wrote that whole
speech for her answering machine.

834
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,695
But you didn't need it,
'cause she picked up the phone.

835
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:57,406
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?

836
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,868
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"

837
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:07,666
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an
ice cream cone or something dorky like that.

838
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:10,711
She said, "Le

839
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,090
I said, "Okay. What do you..."

840
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:06,929
Sam, this is not going to work.

841
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:08,388
What? Why?

842
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:12,559
I've recorded everything
that has taken place since your awakening.

843
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:15,187
If anyone were to
check my memory cache,

844
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:17,981
it would put you in considerable danger.

845
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,237
You could erase my memory banks.

846
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:26,240
I could reboot myself
once you have departed.

847
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,158
Are you okay with that?

848
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:31,495
I'm here to
keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you.

849
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:46,343
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.

850
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:50,305
Sam.

851
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:57,354
Hey.

852
01:27:59,482 --> 01:28:02,651
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot

853
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,279
the moment that I've launched.

854
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:07,114
I understand, Sam.

855
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:08,365
Then you should be okay.

856
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:11,994
I hope life on Earth
is everything you remember it to be.

857
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:15,414
Thanks, Gerty.

858
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:18,417
You gonna be okay?

859
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:19,584
Of course.

860
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,962
The new Sam and I will be
back to our programing

861
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,464
as soon as I've finished rebooting.

862
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:28,218
Gerty, we're not programed.

863
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:30,971
We're people. Understand?

864
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:07,591
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.

865
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:57,307
Fuck!

866
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:26,461
Air lock pressurization complete.

867
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:31,633
Sam?

868
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,177
Hey, Sam?

869
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:40,016
You okay, buddy? Cavalry's here.

870
01:30:43,312 --> 01:30:44,688
Where am I?

871
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:48,942
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.

872
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:50,527
How long have I been out?

873
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:53,530
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?

874
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,516
...made contact. Yeah.

875
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,402
Yeah, Eliza?

876
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,863
He ain't going nowhere.

877
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:38,283
Bag him up and we'll
get started on repairs to the Harvester.

878
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:39,743
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...

879
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:39,803
Lunar Industries stocks
have slipped a further 32%

880
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:41,179
after accusations...

881
01:32:45,142 --> 01:32:47,394
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell,

882
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:50,438
has been giving evidence at CAA's
Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...

883
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:52,148
You know what? He's one of two things.

884
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,150
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.

885
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,611
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
