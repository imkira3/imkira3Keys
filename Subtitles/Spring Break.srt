1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, you gotta get away,
gotta go and play

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,100
Gotta find a day that's
full of nothing but sun

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,500
Cruising down the street,
moving to the beat

5
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,600
Everyone you meet is
having nothing but fun

6
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,200
Leave it all behind you

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,100
Feel those palm trees blow

8
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,100
The folks up north
can't find you

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,800
They're outside
shoveling snow

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,900
The time to move
but don't be slow

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,900
On your mark,
get ready to go

12
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,800
Lovin'
with the Lauderdale ladies

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,000
Playin'
in the Lauderdale sun

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,000
Lovin' with
the Lauderdale ladies

15
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,000
And you won't be going home
till you find...

16
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,800
Nelson,

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,500
wherever you look...
skin skin skin.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Spring break
in Fort Lauderdale.

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,300
250,000 kids

20
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,300
here for the sole purpose
of partying.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,300
Lookin' for the best,
better than the rest

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
Put her to the test
and see that she's number one...

23
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,800
- Hi.
- Special kind of smile

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,900
Special kind of style,
it's gonna be a while

25
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,100
Before you know
how it's done

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,400
Always on the run
when you're lovin'

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,300
With the Lauderdale
ladies

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,300
Playing in the Lauderdale sun

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,100
Lovin'

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,300
With the Lauderdale ladies

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,600
And you won't be going home
till you find the one...

32
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,700
- So this is it?
- Ahh, nothing but the best, buddy!

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Whoo!

34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,500
- Humma humma humma!
- Easy, big fella. Easy.

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,000
Ohh!

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on, guys!
- Nice, huh?

37
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,200
Yeah.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,900
So I'm...

39
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,000
So where'd you hear
about this place anyway,

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
Guinness Book of World Records?

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,400
"Hotel most resembling
a refugee camp."

42
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,000
Excuse me, pardon me.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,700
Sorry. He he!

44
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,500
All right, who's next? Hey!

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,800
Lovin'
with the Lauderdale ladies

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,900
And you won't be going home

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,800
- Till you find the one.
- Do you have a reservation?

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,200
About what?

49
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
I mean yes.
I mean I do.

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,600
- Uh, Stern.
- Stern? Okay.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,200
Stern, uh, yes.
Right.

52
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Here you go.

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,900
- Do you want to sign in?
- Why not?

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
I think he'd like to sign up.

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, there's nothing
wrong with having a good time.

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,100
Bing bing! Bing bing!

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,000
- That's Eesh. Ask him.
- Hi there.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,100
Hi.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Holy sh...

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,400
Viola!

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,100
Gentlemen, home!

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,700
I think somebody's using
this room.

63
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,800
Oh, no no!
Don't worry about it.

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,900
No! This...
this is lickety-split.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
See?

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,200
Very clean.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Over here? No problem.
Two seconds... one, two,

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,200
three.

69
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,300
Good like brand new!

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Bingo, huh?

71
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,900
Look... sanitized
for your protection.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,200
And over here, please.

73
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,600
Over here...

74
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,200
see? The wonderful view!

75
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
Oh, this.

76
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,200
Well.

77
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,700
Nice!

78
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,700
So?

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,900
Now you tip.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Oh.

81
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,400
- All I have is a five.
- No problem.

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,500
Anything you need, you call Eesh.
Anything you want, you call Eesh.

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,900
You get in troubles...

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
they work themselves out.

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,800
Enjoy!

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,300
Okay.

87
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, I'm gonna go
down to the pool,

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,600
get a beer and a hard-on.

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,400
First we take off our shoes.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,400
Do you want help
with your laces?

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,100
I'm... I'm sorry.
I just still feel... funny.

92
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,300
Nelson, relax.

93
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,700
You're not funny.

94
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,300
So what if you took off? So what if
your stepfather's mad that you took off?

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Nelson, you gotta stop letting this guy
push you around so much.

96
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,400
You weren't even there
when he decided

97
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,200
you're supposed to
work during spring break.

98
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,800
You had no choice!

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Nelson, he was gonna make you
stay there at home in the snow,

100
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,600
where every kit's covered up
by a shirt and two sweaters.

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,700
We're talking cruel and unusual
punishment here

102
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,600
just to work on
his goddamn campaign.

103
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Campaign?
It's not even off the ground yet.

104
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,300
Shit.

105
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,600
Nelson, we're college students.

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,000
College students don't work
during spring break. It's unnatural.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,300
We're supposed to
go fucking crazy.

108
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,100
College students are supposed to go
fucking crazy during spring break

109
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,200
because after college is over,
they're never expected to ever again.

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,300
This is your chance.
Don't blow it.

111
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
If you don't go
crazy down here,

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
then you are crazy!

113
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,400
All right, all right, all right!

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,200
Oh, buddy buddy buddy,
this is gonna be great!

115
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,300
Come here! Hurry up, will ya?

116
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,200
Hey, man, do you mind? I've been
sweating my ass off since Gainesville.

117
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,600
Go ahead.

118
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,800
Beer is like...

119
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
fucking great, you know?

120
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
Welcome to Florida.

121
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,500
Whoa!
Stand up and cheer.

122
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
Aww, sheesh.

123
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Isn't your air conditioning
working right?

124
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,400
It's you that's not
working right, Eddie.

125
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,900
I can see why
my brother died young.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
What I can't see is why he
married you in the first place.

127
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,100
Why did he?

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,900
I'm busy.
What do you want?

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Guess what? I still got
a hot buyer for this dump.

130
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,600
You can turn around and
march your ass out of here.

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,300
I'm not selling this hotel.

132
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,700
You sure?
Heh heh heh!

133
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,500
You may not have to sell.

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Maybe it'll just be
taken away from you.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Will you get out of here?

136
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,300
I was talking to Philly Kaufman down
at the bank today.

137
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,300
I bet you didn't know
that Philly Kaufman and I

138
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,900
are old poker buddies, did you?

139
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,100
Well, Philly says you're
way behind in your mortgage payments.

140
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm always behind
before spring break

141
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
and I'm always paid up
when it's over.

142
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,400
Well, God forbid something should
happen to close you down

143
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,100
- before you could pay it up.
- Will you get out of here?

144
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,900
My sister-in-law Geri Potmore;
my friend Mr. Ames.

145
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,800
- Pleasure.
- Charmed.

146
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,900
- Another poker buddy?
- Close enough.

147
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,600
I thought Ames would take
an interest in going over the place.

148
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
He takes a professional interest.
He's got a professional right.

149
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,100
He belongs to
the Unsafe Buildings Commission.

150
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
My ID.

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Okay.
Go inspect.

152
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,200
Heh heh heh. Thanks, Ger.

153
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,200
- What an asshole.
- Really.

154
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
- Oh, sorry.
- Why?

155
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,500
You hit the nail
right on the head.

156
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,900
What can I do for you fellas?
Nothing too tough though, okay?

157
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,800
Nah, we have reservations.

158
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,100
Oh, hi.

159
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,600
Suitcase.
Catch you later.

160
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,300
- Hey hey!
- Pleasure.

161
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,700
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Pardon me.

162
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
- Popular room.
- Too popular.

163
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,700
It's a nice one, huh?

164
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,300
Swell.

165
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,100
- Yeah, hi, this is room 21.
Oh yeah, right... Stern.

166
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,400
No, see, we got a problem.
This is Stu Molinera

167
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,700
- and you gave the room to me.
- But Stern's in there.

168
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,500
- That's the problem.
- Just a sec. Let me check.

169
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,900
I really need this.

170
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,500
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I've got a lot on my mind.

171
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,700
I don't know what to say.
Every room in town is booked.

172
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,700
- So what are you gonna do?
- Send up some extra towels?

173
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,500
I can't fucking believe this.

174
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,500
- Yo, OT!
- Everything settled?

175
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,500
I haven't even sat my ass down yet
and bang! A hassle.

176
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,500
That's bullshit.
This is my vacation.

177
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Isn't it funny how well
hassles travel?

178
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,300
You know what my vacation
was last year?

179
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,900
Working one job instead of three.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,600
I mean, I've been saving money for
two years to come down here.

181
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,200
You know what it's like saving
money in New York?

182
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,500
It's like making it with your sister...
it's just not done.

183
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,600
Whoa, is that one hot
sun out there.

184
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
So what's the story?

185
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,200
The story is
we got "el shafto grande."

186
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,700
We have nowhere to go.

187
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,100
- Fuck it.
- Man, what do you mean, "Fuck it"?

188
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,500
We're here.

189
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,500
You're right.

190
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,300
When you're right you're right,
and you are right, brother.

191
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,800
Wait a minute. I think it's great
that you guys are so right,

192
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,600
- but what are you talking about?
- Stayin'.

193
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,100
- I know, but where?
- Here.

194
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,300
- What?
- What are we supposed to do?

195
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,400
Sleep in the fucking car?

196
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,400
I mean, come on.
What are you gonna do, throw us out?

197
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,800
You won't even know we're here.

198
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,200
Don't worry about us.
You guys go swim,

199
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
- get laid, whatever.
- Now wait a minute.

200
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Stu. OT.

201
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm Nelson. This is Adam.

202
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,400
No, thanks.

203
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,300
we already paid for this room.

204
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,100
- Why is that a problem?
- Really. That's a big help.

205
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,500
Oh, come on!

206
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Listen, let's just play it
by ear, okay?

207
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
- Okay, OT?
- Ready.

208
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,600
See you guys later.
Have fun.

209
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,800
All right then, Mr. Dalby
will see you tomorrow at...

210
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,500
- Take care of it.
- Yes, sir.

211
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,500
God damn it.
It's all I need is a cold.

212
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,300
Ernest, you're not getting a cold.
Calm down.

213
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,100
I find it very disturbing that
one lousy night

214
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,200
can be so damned important.

215
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,700
It's a testimonial for you,
not a court martial.

216
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Don't be too sure.
You have no idea

217
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,200
how fast so-called friends
can turn on you.

218
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,400
One little slip up and they go
from following you to chasing you.

219
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,600
- I have to be perfect.
- That's not very realistic.

220
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,000
Politics has nothing
to do with being realistic.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,600
I tell you, one juicy rumor
and forget it.

222
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,200
You could put every penny
you had into my campaign

223
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,700
and it wouldn't help.

224
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,600
Nearly every penny
is in it already.

225
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,900
Can you spare me
the commentary?

226
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,800
All I am saying
is that this dinner

227
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
is either going to make
or break my political career.

228
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,200
Nothing can go wrong...
not one thing.

229
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,600
Yes?

230
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,700
Mmm.
It's DiFozio.

231
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,700
What is it, Nick?

232
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,200
What?

233
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,700
He's gone?
Nelson's gone!

234
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,700
He's supposed to be
organizing the canvassers,

235
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,300
putting out the mailing lists,
doing at least six other things.

236
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
God damn it,
he'll cripple me.

237
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,900
What? No no!
Don't call the police.

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,500
That's the last thing I need,
God damn it.

239
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,600
No, just... just...
Never mind, Nick. Never mind.

240
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,500
I'll take care of it myself.

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You see? Didn't I always say
Nelson was irresponsible?

242
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,600
Well, now he has
finally proven it.

243
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,500
Maybe he's doing
some sort of research.

244
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,500
Whoo! This is great.

245
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,900
Go go go go go go!

246
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,000
All the way from the Big Apple,

247
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,800
OT Blastin!

248
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,300
It's O as in "out there"
and T as in "totally."

249
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,200
Hey, OT!

250
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,300
That's my roommate!

251
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,000
Let's hear it for
OT Blastin from New York

252
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,600
where nothing's normal!

253
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
OT! OT! All right!

254
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,600
Now that concludes
the semi-finals of today's competition.

255
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,900
And in just a couple of minutes
we'll move on to the finals.

256
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,600
All right?
Now don't forget

257
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,800
that The Candy Store
is the home of a special drink.

258
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,500
It's called
The Spring Break Screamer.

259
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,200
One part vodka, two parts rum,

260
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,700
three parts gin...

261
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,800
Toto, I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore.

262
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,000
Two beers, please!

263
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

264
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,400
- Fuckin' asshole!
- Ahh!

265
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm gonna kick your ass,
fug-face!

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
- It was an accident. It was.
- Excuse me.

267
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,100
- Sir?
- What?

268
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,600
I don't think he's that much
of a fug-face.

269
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,200
That's my roommate.

270
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
You wanna leave him alone?
All right?

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You too, shit for brains!

272
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,000
Get out of the fuckin'...

273
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,300
- Thank you.
- He hurt you?

274
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,800
- No no, I'm fine.
- Thank you.

275
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,500
Uh, I don't think Nelson would have been
too much fun with his head torn off.

276
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,500
Really?
Head torn off.

277
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,400
Okay, everybody,
it's time for the finals!

278
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,600
- Come on.
- The final round of competition

279
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,100
here at The Candy Store...
the belly-flop contest.

280
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,900
- Let's go.
- Look what I found over here.

281
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,400
All right,
here's our first finalist.

282
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,300
Let's hear it
for Mr. Universe!

283
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,600
Mr. Universe!

284
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,700
He's a real crowd-pleaser.
Isn't he, ladies and gentlemen?

285
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,100
What a guy.

286
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,800
- Jump! Go!
- Come on.

287
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,500
Go!

288
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,200
All right,
that's Mr. Universe!

289
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,700
What's he train on,
antifreeze?

290
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,800
Wait a minute, you guys.
Here you go, here you go.

291
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,900
Give 'em hell, buddy.

292
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,600
All right, here we go!
Our next contestant

293
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,600
making his final jump of the day,
from the University of Massachusetts,

294
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,000
crazy gut guy!

295
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,900
Crazy gut guy!

296
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,400
Ahhhh!

297
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,900
That man makes
a big splash, ladies and gentlemen.

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,900
Let's hear it for
crazy gut guy!

299
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,900
He's gonna be
tough to beat.

300
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,500
Oh shit.

301
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,000
Go go go go go!

302
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,800
Okay, man, go for it.
Blow 'em away.

303
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,900
OT Blastin! We can't keep score.

304
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,800
A belly-flop record!

305
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,000
OT Blastin from New York!

306
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,600
Beers!
Beers, everybody! Beers!

307
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,500
Go go go go go go!

308
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,500
I live in the city

309
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
And I love the lights

310
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,300
Ooh, we're from the city

311
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,500
We're going out tonight

312
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,200
My girl's so pretty

313
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,300
She's out of sight

314
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Ooh, we're from the city

315
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,400
We're getting down tonight.

316
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Come on, buddy.
Come on, come on.

317
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,100
- Wait, Stu.
- Take it easy, man.

318
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,200
Just a bunch of guys
getting in the car

319
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,600
No matter who's
driving up or how far

320
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,300
Feels so good,
feels so alive

321
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,800
Know that the driver stays,
I don't drive

322
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,300
Me and the boys

323
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Just me and the boys

324
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,700
Me and the boys...

325
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,400
Hey, how many miles
to the gallon do you get?

326
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,200
Hey hey!

327
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,900
Me and my buds
just like to go

328
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,300
We're having fun,
everybody knows

329
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,900
We don't fuss
and we never grab

330
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,300
We just dig
taking in the sights

331
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,500
Me and the boys...

332
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,300
Just me and the boys...

333
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,900
Me and the boys...

334
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,100
Sure.

335
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,700
- Yo, OT?
- What?

336
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,300
OT, come here.

337
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

338
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,100
Beer?

339
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,400
- Well, all right.
- Come on, let's go party.

340
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,300
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on.

341
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Yo, Nelson.

342
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,200
We got the car.

343
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,500
Just a bunch of guys
getting in the car

344
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,200
No matter who's
driving up or how far

345
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,500
Feels so good,
feels so alive

346
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,700
Know that the driver stays,
I don't drive...

347
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,000
This is great!
Let's go find a saloon!

348
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,500
I've never seen so many people
in all my life!

349
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,300
They're all over the place.
And they're all having fun!

350
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,400
More fun than I've
ever had.

351
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,100
Got no sex issues, know what I mean?
This is great.

352
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,600
What? Hi!
How are you? Oh boy!

353
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,900
Me and my buds
just like to go

354
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,200
We have fun,
everybody knows

355
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,100
We don't fuss
and we never grab

356
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,400
We just groove
taking in the sights

357
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,700
Me and the boys

358
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,000
- Just me and the boys...
- Want a ride somewhere?

359
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,100
Should we give her a ride?
Go back.

360
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,100
- Me and the boys.
- Give her a ride!

361
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,200
She likes me!
I'm sure of it!

362
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,600
I keep wondering what
Stu said to those girls.

363
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,200
Oh, probably something like...

364
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,100
"Nice night, isn't it?

365
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,800
Be nicer if
you spent it with us."

366
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,600
He probably made it
sound good too.

367
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,700
Sure. Stu is what you call
professionally cool.

368
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,500
Yeah, really.

369
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Hey, that last bar
was pretty good.

370
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
I think that girl in
the white pants liked you.

371
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,900
What was her name, Serena?

372
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,100
Yeah, she was drunk.

373
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,000
I thought you were
buying her the drinks.

374
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,800
Those guys sure know
how to have a good time.

375
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,400
We're doing all right.
What do you want?

376
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,700
Shit.

377
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,700
- No.
- Come on.

378
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,000
- There they are!
Want us to tuck you in?

379
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,700
It's too bright in here.

380
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,800
Whoa!

381
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
I'm sorry. Here.

382
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,800
This plant's leaking on me.

383
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,400
Ohh.

384
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Oh, just a minute.

385
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Wait. I'll be right back.

386
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,800
Hey, how you doin'?

387
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,500
I'm okay.

388
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,600
Did you see those chicks?
They're like... whoa, you know?

389
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,100
Jeez.

390
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,400
Hey, um...

391
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,900
Well, do you think you could
get out of the bed?

392
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,700
You know what I mean?
It's just... you know...

393
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,500
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

394
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,200
- Of course. Sure.
- Thanks.

395
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
Yeah, thanks a lot.

396
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,700
I don't believe this.

397
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,900
Okay.

398
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,600
I can't stand it.

399
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,500
Don't listen.

400
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,600
Jesus.

401
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,600
This is making me crazy.

402
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,300
Where are you going?

403
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,100
Jesus Christ.

404
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,100
Nelson, those are
"Playboy" tits.

405
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,900
I've never seen "Playboy" tits anywhere
except "Playboy."

406
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,300
Come on, man,
where's your manners?

407
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,200
Sorry.

408
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,200
What?

409
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,100
I'm just figuring out what
you're trying to shave off here.

410
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
Stu, how come you always
talk like that?

411
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,800
Like what?

412
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,700
You always move your head
when you say something.

413
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
What the hell are you talking...

414
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,200
Get the hell outta here,
will you, please?

415
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,700
So you guys know
where you're gonna go?

416
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,700
No, not really.

417
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,500
Well, Nelson and I
talked about this.

418
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,300
I don't know how
you guys feel, but...

419
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,100
we were thinking maybe you'd
like to stay here.

420
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,600
- Are you serious?
- Really?

421
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,300
- No, not really, but...
Yeah!

422
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,400
All right, all right!

423
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,800
Hey, I feel like I should kiss you.
Anybody got a ring?

424
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,800
You can kiss that, man.
There it is! Hup hup hup!

425
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,500
May, get in here.

426
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,300
What in the...
what is he doing?

427
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Look at this.
Look!

428
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,300
- Well, it's Nelson.
- Well, of course it's Nelson.

429
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,600
- That's why I showed it to you.
- What's he doing?

430
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,500
He is killing me.

431
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,400
Doing this in Fort Lauderdale?
I mean, think who's going to see this.

432
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,400
Imagine what they're
going to think of me.

433
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,000
It's not a very
good picture of him.

434
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,400
Well, it's good enough.
Get the boat ready.

435
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,200
- We're going up there.
- Today?

436
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,500
Now. He is running around
making an ass of himself and me,

437
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,300
and it's got to be stopped.
I mean, this is the kind of thing

438
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,300
that can blow a political campaign
right out of the water!

439
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,300
- Forget it. I'm not doing it.
- No, Nelson.

440
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,800
Eesh said this guy will
only deal with one of us.

441
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,500
- It's your money. Do it.
- Okay.

442
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,800
- What if it was your money?
- Get out of here.

443
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,400
It's only gonna take
a couple minutes, Nelson.

444
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,600
Man, what's your problem?
Too much caffeine?

445
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,700
Hello?

446
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,800
Hello?

447
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,500
Hello?

448
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,100
Buenos dias.

449
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,200
Uh, por favor.

450
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,200
You must excuse
my tardiness.

451
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,100
I had to kill a man.

452
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,200
No problem.

453
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,300
Eesh sent you, huh?

454
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,400
- What is it you want?
- Um...

455
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,400
well, see, my friends and I
were sort of wondering

456
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,800
where we could find some p...
stuff, you know,

457
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,400
to sort of have around, right?

458
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,000
- And Eesh said that maybe you...
- You want pot, huh?

459
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,100
- Isn't that it?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

460
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,700
Amigo, if there is something
going on,

461
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,400
you will go home in the trunks
of 10 different cars.

462
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,700
No no. No, nothing's wrong.
Mmm. No.

463
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,900
Ahem.

464
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,800
- So is good, huh?
- Mmm!

465
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,300
Mmm, yeah.

466
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,400
- 250!
- Dollars?

467
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,700
You think is too much?

468
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,900
No no, that's not... no.

469
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,400
No, that's fine.

470
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,200
Here's some paper.

471
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,300
Matches.

472
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,700
Here you go.

473
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,500
No no no no!
Please, no.

474
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Es bueno, huh?

475
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,800
Uh, muy.

476
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,500
100!

477
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,900
- 100 watts? That's very good.
- No, $100.

478
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,800
- 15 watts.
- Ahh.

479
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,500
Here you go.

480
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,100
Thank you.

481
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,200
Something else?

482
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,600
- No, that ought to do it.
- Have a nice day.

483
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,900
You too.

484
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,400
Hey, buddy.

485
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Look at...

486
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Oh my God.

487
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,200
Hey, you got any left for me?

488
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,900
Later.

489
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,200
Winter is my enemy

490
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,000
The beach is where
I'd rather be

491
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Lots of sand
and lots of swimming

492
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,100
One long beach
just filled with women

493
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,900
Let's hit the beach

494
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,100
Let's hit the beach

495
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,000
Let's hit the beach

496
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,000
Let's hit the beach

497
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,200
Take the beach
by sneak attack

498
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,900
Grab the women,
drag 'em back

499
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,300
Torture prisoners
till they talk

500
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,600
Plenty of babes,
the old boardwalk

501
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,900
Let's hit the beach

502
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,300
Let's hit
the beach

503
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,200
Let's hit the beach

504
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,000
Let's hit
the beach

505
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,600
Let's hit the beach
beach beach

506
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,400
Let's hit
the beach beach beach

507
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,300
Let's hit the beach
beach beach

508
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,800
Let's hit
the beach beach beach

509
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,800
Let's hit the beach.

510
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,500
Hi, Mr. Dalby. Hi!

511
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,800
Welcome welcome!
How are you?

512
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You look like a million bucks.

513
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,900
Or maybe I should say
a million votes.

514
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh, thank you.
You remember Thomas and Lloyd?

515
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,100
Yeah, sure.

516
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,100
But they aren't used to the heat
down here, are they?

517
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,000
Could we get on to the business
at hand?

518
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,700
Um, you gotta believe me
when I tell you

519
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,800
that I've done everything I can
with my sister-in-law.

520
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,200
But when it gets
to that hotel,

521
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,500
she's as tough to move
as a concrete mattress.

522
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,600
- Potmore...
- But I got a guy who can do the job.

523
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,000
His name's Ames. The only trouble
is he's gonna cost us five grand.

524
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,800
- But he says...
- Would you please listen to me?

525
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
- Yeah.
- The business at hand

526
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,300
is not the hotel,
it's my stepson.

527
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,300
- There's nothing wrong with him?
- There's plenty wrong with him.

528
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,600
He's in Fort Lauderdale.
I want him found.

529
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,900
No sooner said than done.

530
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,800
Potmore?

531
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,300
Do you know what
he looks like?

532
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,000
Jesus.

533
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,400
Here.

534
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,100
- Ahh. Good-looking boy.
- Hmm.

535
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,300
Find him and
you'll have your $5,000.

536
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
And Potmore?

537
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,600
Not a word to my wife.

538
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,400
Let's get some beer.

539
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,000
- Beer!
- Can we have four beers?

540
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,800
Make it eight... eight beers.

541
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,900
Ladies and gentlemen, party!

542
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,800
Yeah!

543
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,600
Everybody's got an ambition

544
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:38,100
Doin' things that
they want to do

545
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,500
Trying every kind
of position

546
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,500
Hoping that their dream
will come true

547
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,300
Open up your eyes
and see I'm not disguised

548
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,700
What I want to
say to you

549
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I want to do it, do it

550
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,300
I want to do it
to you

551
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
I want to do it,
do it

552
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,700
I want to do it
to you

553
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,000
You don't need
your ma's permission

554
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,000
You're thinking about
a rendezvous

555
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,500
I see that I arouse
your suspicion

556
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,900
And you're wondering if
it's gonna come true

557
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,300
It's really not surprising,
your temperature is rising

558
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,000
Listen while I
give you a clue

559
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,600
I want to do it, do it

560
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,500
I want to do it to you

561
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,100
- I want to do it
- Do it

562
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,500
I want to do it
to you

563
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,800
Do it, do it, do it, do it

564
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,100
I want to do it to you

565
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,900
Do it, do it, do it, do it

566
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I want to do it to you

567
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,800
Do it, do it, do it, do it

568
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,300
I want to do it to you

569
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,300
- Do it, do it
- Do it, do it

570
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,700
I want to do it to you

571
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,400
- I want to do it
- Do it

572
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,100
I want to do it to you

573
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,300
- I want to do it
- Do it

574
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,100
I want to do it to you

575
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,000
- I want to do it
- Do it

576
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
I want to do it to you

577
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,500
- I want to do it
- Do it

578
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,900
I want to do it to you

579
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,600
- I want to do it
- Do it

580
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,600
I want to do it to you.

581
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,000
- I feel great.
- You're supposed to!

582
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,500
- Not this great.
- He's loaded. He's loaded.

583
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I'm drunker than you are.

584
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,900
- I'm so wasted.
- You look it.

585
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,300
Hey hey,
I found something to drink!

586
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,200
Ahhh!

587
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,800
Get him, get him get him!

588
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,000
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
No no no!

589
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,600
Stop it, stop it!

590
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
What? Hey!

591
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,700
- What happened to him?
- Where you runnin'?

592
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,300
What happened?

593
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,800
He's here.

594
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,200
Your stepfather?

595
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah, my stepfather.

596
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,700
Oh, shit.
His stepfather.

597
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,800
That's his boat down there
in the water.

598
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,100
Well, where's it supposed to be,
in valet parking?

599
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,900
Stu, you don't understand.

600
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,600
- His stepfather's an asshole.
- Why? My father's an asshole.

601
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,300
We're talking king
of the assholes here.

602
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,200
This is a drag.

603
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Shit. Does your stepfather
know you're down here?

604
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,700
- I don't know.
- So why the rabbit routine?

605
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,300
- You're bringing everybody down.
- I'm sorry.

606
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,900
It's cool. There's only one way
we can get it going again.

607
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,500
What's that?

608
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,400
Drink!

609
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,500
Has anyone ever died
of a hangover?

610
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,500
I can't move my eyes.

611
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,200
It was those last
four or five beers.

612
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Ahhh.

613
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,100
I'm... I'm going upstairs.

614
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,000
You really feel that bad?

615
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,900
No, I'm okay. I just have to
throw up for a while.

616
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,100
Operator.

617
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,500
- Um, hi... Uh...
- Hello?

618
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,500
Ernest Dalby, please.

619
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,500
Hello?

620
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,700
Hello!

621
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,900
- Who is this?
- It's Nelson.

622
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,600
Don't you dare hang up!

623
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,600
Wha... I called you.

624
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,800
What in the hell
have you been doing?

625
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,400
I know you're in Fort Lauderdale
and so am I.

626
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,000
Now you get your fanny down to
the marina pronto. Do you hear me?

627
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,200
Nelson!
Nelson, do you hear me?

628
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,100
Nelson, are you listening?

629
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,100
Nelson!
God, Nels...

630
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,000
It's a wonderful day,
let the music play

631
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,600
You keep wishing that
it's never gonna end...

632
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,700
Look out!

633
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,700
Playing by the sea,
all the people you meet

634
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,700
Thinkin' how it's
good to have friends

635
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,500
Taking a leave
is the only thing to do

636
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,800
Things are just as fine
as they can be

637
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,300
Everybody's insane
and they're feeling no pain...

638
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,500
Ahhh!

639
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,300
Can you handle
everything you see?

640
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,700
And we're singing
songs of love

641
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,200
We're wishing on
the stars above

642
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,300
It's happening
every single day

643
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,900
As long as it's good
we'll take it any old way

644
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,600
It's a wonderful day,
let the music play

645
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,400
Here's to wishing
that it's never gonna end

646
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,200
Playing by the sea,
all the people you meet

647
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,000
Thinking how
it's good to have friends

648
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,200
And we're singing

649
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,100
The songs of love,
we're wishing

650
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,800
On the stars above

651
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,100
And laughing
every single day

652
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,400
So long as it's good,
we'll take it any old way

653
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,100
It's a wonderful day,
let the music play

654
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Here's to wishing that
it's never gonna end

655
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,700
Playing by the sea,
all the people you meet

656
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,500
Thinking how
it's good to have friends

657
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,400
Look at that dude
working on a scheme

658
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,100
Looking for the one
he thinks is best

659
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,800
Taking it easy,
just a little bit sleazy

660
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,100
Knowing that you're
different from the rest

661
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,500
And we're singing
songs of love

662
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,100
We're wishing
on the stars above

663
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,000
It's happening
every single day

664
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,800
So long as it's good
we'll take it any old way

665
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,300
It's a wonderful day,
let the music play

666
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,300
Here's to wishing that
it's never gonna end

667
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,100
Playing by the sea...

668
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,000
One.

669
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,000
You guys want a chili dog?

670
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:38,100
Thinking how it's good
to have friends.

671
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,800
Don't wipe your nose on it!

672
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,900
Jeez.

673
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,800
The Button,

674
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,400
home of the annual
Fort Lauderdale!

675
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,300
- Whoo!
- Spring games!

676
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,300
Hey, you guys ready for
some serious competition or what?

677
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,600
Whooo!

678
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,300
The lady from Pennsylvania
is going wild!

679
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,100
The lady from Pennsylvania is doing
a job on Kid Austin.

680
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,900
It's hard to believe that
this lady is so quick!

681
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,500
Now Kid Austin is holding her
with his right hand.

682
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,100
She hits him in the jaw
and hits him down!

683
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,000
And the referee goes down too.
She's on top of him!

684
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,800
- The people are going crazy!
- One, two...

685
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,800
He's counting them out.

686
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,000
- One of the referees is down too.
- Five, six...

687
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's amazing.

688
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,100
It looks like Lucy from Pennsylvania
has done a fantastic job!

689
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,300
Oh my God!

690
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have awarded three points

691
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,000
to the winning team...
Pennsylvania!

692
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,700
Pennsylvania!

693
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,500
This is the most incredible decision
that has ever taken place

694
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,900
in our championship ring!

695
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,300
Hey, you want to go for a ride
on the back of my hog?

696
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,300
What's wrong?
Don't you like to go fast?

697
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,800
Or are you the kind that
likes to go slow?

698
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,800
- Get lost, hmm?
- What's wrong?

699
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,000
I'll do you great,
sweet cheeks.

700
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,500
Get lost.

701
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,300
I'm not...

702
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,700
Hey.

703
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,200
Hey, man,
don't you have someplace to be?

704
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,400
You fuckin'...

705
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,200
- Ahhh!
- Ohhh!

706
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,000
Come on, let's hear some cheers!

707
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,200
Excuse me, have you seen
this kid anywhere?

708
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,500
I see people all day long.
l...

709
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,700
Okay, man, you sure?
You seen anybody?

710
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,800
l...

711
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

712
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,500
it's time for the one and only
world-famous

713
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,900
Button wet-T-shirt
extravaganza!

714
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,700
And here come the ladies
from Pennsylvania!

715
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,500
And their opponents
this evening

716
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,000
are from Ohio!

717
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,600
Oh, I gotta see this.
I gotta see this.

718
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,300
Well, it was Saturday night
and I was feeling all right...

719
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,600
Ahhh!

720
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,600
- Hi, cutie.
- What? Are you talking to me?

721
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,800
Yeah. Don't you
think you're sexy?

722
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,200
Oh my God!

723
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,900
All the time!

724
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,800
- What you doing later?
- Ah, hopefully something with you.

725
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,200
Sounds good.
Stay right there.

726
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,000
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll be right here.

727
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,400
Wet 'em down, boys!
- Wet 'em down!

728
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,300
Ahhhh!

729
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,800
We now have wet T-shirts.

730
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,800
And who's going to be the first lady
to win this evening?

731
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,200
Which lady is going to
help win it...

732
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,500
Wait, over here. Over here!

733
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
they're going crazy.

734
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,300
Excuse me, lady!

735
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,400
I've always heard good things
about Ohio!

736
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,300
- Aha!
- They'll all take it off!

737
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,200
Let's hear it for
the amazing ladies.

738
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,100
They're doing
a fantastic job this evening.

739
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,500
Let's hear it for them! What an amazing
job from these ladies.

740
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,200
They're taking it off!
They're taking it off!

741
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,600
Let's hear it for these ladies.
They're doing an amazing job!

742
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,200
Let's hear it for 'em!

743
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,500
They're gonna go all the way!

744
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,900
And some of the young ladies in
the audience are getting into it!

745
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,100
Ooh!

746
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,100
They're going out.
Everything is off!

747
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
they're leaving nothing to chance.

748
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,800
This is the kind of
competitive spirit

749
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,700
that has made America great.
This is what it's all about!

750
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Pee! Come on! Go!

751
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,300
Hi.

752
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,600
Shh!

753
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,700
Temperamental machine.

754
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,600
- Ahh!
- Too much thruster.

755
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,700
Yeah.

756
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,100
You know,
I saw you the other day.

757
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,100
You were at...

758
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,300
- Use the shield more.
- Like this?

759
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,400
Yeah, a little.
Yeah.

760
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,600
- Look out. There's a pulsar.
- Where?

761
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,100
- In the zone.
- What do you mean?

762
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,400
- The photon blast.
- I don't see it.

763
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,200
Don't hyper... here.

764
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,800
God, you're really good.

765
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,700
Actually, I'm better than that.
I just... you know.

766
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,300
- Oop, that pointy thing.
- Gamma dart.

767
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,200
It's one of my more useful skills.

768
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,600
- You wanna play doubles?
- Sure.

769
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,300
Okay.

770
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,300
Guys, don't you worry,

771
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:48,200
because coming up is
the wet he-shirt open!

772
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,700
And ladies,
I do mean open!

773
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,900
- Let's sign up.
- Are you crazy? What do we gotta do?

774
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,900
- Who the fuck cares?
- Go go go!

775
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,200
Innkeeper!
Two beers.

776
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,400
Thank you.

777
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,600
Here we go, ladies.
Wet 'em down!

778
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,700
- Hey, I'm Carla.
- I'm Diane.

779
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,300
Hi, I'm wet.

780
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,200
Ahhh!

781
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
Oh my God!

782
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,100
Is everybody ready?
Then let's do it.

783
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,100
'Cause you're horny all day
and you stay up all night...

784
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
the boys are getting wild and wooly

785
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,300
at The Button!
They're rocking and rolling.

786
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,200
The girls are measuring
for the competition!

787
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,100
The ladies are all
gonna go crazy!

788
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,000
And what's this?
A player's down.

789
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,100
He's going down.
It's the great American rip off!

790
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,700
You're all the witnesses.
It's a rip off, ladies and gentlemen.

791
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,800
That's my roommate.

792
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
- Which one?
- The tall one.

793
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,700
- What's his name?
- He's from Brooklyn.

794
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,000
His name's Brooklyn?

795
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,600
No.
Look at him.

796
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,800
These men are smoking.
They're steaming.

797
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,800
Women in their presence can't
contain themselves any longer.

798
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,700
Oh my God.
He's ripping his shirt on back.

799
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,000
This is one cocky competitor.

800
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,800
And it looks like he's going to
bring up reinforcements.

801
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,600
- Go go go!
- Go, Brooklyn!

802
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,500
Hey, come on, man!
You got nothing to lose.

803
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,800
Show 'em that famous
Molinera muscle!

804
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,900
Here he goes!
It's all coming off!

805
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,900
Oh, fuck the picture.
You wanna go inside or not?

806
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,700
Two bucks. Let's go.
Give me the money.

807
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,700
Thank you. Inside.

808
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,500
Hi. Nice to see you.

809
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,800
Now comes the one
and only

810
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,000
banana-eating extravaganza!

811
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,000
Do we have any contestants?

812
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,400
Yo, OT.
Come on, big man.

813
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,600
Go go go go go!

814
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,300
Go go go go!

815
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,600
- This is gonna be great.
- This is already great.

816
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,300
There are no points to score
in the banana-eating extravaganza.

817
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,100
The reason is people know
who's scoring.

818
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,900
The rules are simple
because there are none.

819
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,200
All these couples have to do
is eat these bananas

820
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,800
as erotically and as
outrageously as possible.

821
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,000
So go for it!

822
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,200
Yeah yeah, hang on.
Wait here, okay? Don't move.

823
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,600
I won't move.

824
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,400
Dude, you know that girl that
I saw before? She's back here.

825
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,800
She asked me if I'd
go home with her.

826
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,800
Go have a good time!
Get out of here.

827
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,100
How are we gonna
find anybody in here?

828
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,500
I don't know.

829
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,400
Give me a break!

830
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,600
Look at this!
A bodice pipe.

831
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,900
A double whammy
with the sliding sit-downs.

832
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,700
- Take the button off.
- What?

833
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,300
Take the button off.

834
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,600
- Are you all set?
- Yeah.

835
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,600
Look at this! These two have
only tongue in between 'em!

836
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,700
And here is a one-handed
car boost!

837
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
they have gone absolutely crazy.

838
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,000
They're going nuts. And everybody
wants a piece of the action.

839
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,300
It's all happening during spring break
right here in Fort Lauderdale.

840
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,700
Come on, let's scream.
Come on!

841
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,700
Let's scream louder!

842
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,700
Louder!

843
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,100
Good evening.

844
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,900
Maybe I should give him
a call, I don't know.

845
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,800
Oh, shit.

846
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,300
Well... good night.

847
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,500
Aren't you coming in?

848
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,100
Sure.

849
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,700
Come on.

850
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,300
Don't mind my mess.

851
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,200
You okay?

852
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,100
Yeah yeah.

853
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,700
I wish you weren't
leaving tomorrow.

854
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,400
It's a whole night away.

855
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,200
What's wrong?

856
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,500
I'm, uh, thirsty.

857
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,200
How about a Coke?

858
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,700
Sure, great.

859
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,700
You get me one too?

860
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,500
Go on, hurry up.

861
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,500
Okay.

862
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,300
- I never knew...
- Hey.

863
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,400
- You got a Coke machine?
- Yeah, right over there.

864
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500
Thanks.

865
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,300
When I'd be saying to you

866
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,600
Don't let this good love
slip away

867
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,900
Now that we know
that it's true

868
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,600
Don't... don't you know
the kind of man I am?

869
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,100
No, said I'd never
fall in love again

870
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,500
But it's real and
the feeling comes shining through

871
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,800
I'm so caught up in you

872
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,800
Little girl

873
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,900
And I never did
suspect a thing

874
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,100
So caught up in you

875
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,200
- Little girl...
- Um...

876
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,200
That I never want to
get myself free

877
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,400
And baby, it's true
you're the one

878
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,500
Who caught me,
baby, you taught me

879
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,500
How good it could be

880
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:16,000
It took so long to
change my mind

881
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,200
I thought that love
was a game

882
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:22,300
I played around
enough to find

883
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,500
No two are ever the same

884
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,100
You made me realize
the love I'd missed

885
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,700
So hot,
love I couldn't quite resist

886
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,700
When it's right,
the light just comes shining through

887
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm so caught up in you...

888
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,100
- It's me.
- Little girl

889
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,900
- You're the one that...
- Well, come right in.

890
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,500
I'm so caught up in you,
little girl

891
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,700
That I never want to
get myself free

892
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:57,400
And baby, it's true
you're the one

893
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:03,200
Who caught me, baby, you taught me
how could it could be...

894
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,700
Down?

895
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,900
Look, I just don't know her name
or room number, that's all.

896
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Come on, guy.

897
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,800
Hey, listen, you know that
really pretty girl I came in with?

898
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,500
Who was she?

899
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,600
She's waiting for me!

900
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,300
Whenever you want me...

901
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,700
Thank you.
Thank... thanks a lot.

902
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,600
Nice. Nice guy.

903
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,500
When you should turn
and walk away

904
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,000
- Oh no...
- Where are you?

905
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,600
I can't live without you...

906
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,100
- Where are you?
- I'm so caught up in you.

907
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,300
No wonder it looks like
you slept in a Cuisinart.

908
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,500
Thank you.

909
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,200
So what happened to you?

910
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,400
Ahh, Carla and Diane.

911
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:23,100
I think I'm gonna start
writing my memoirs.

912
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,000
Oh, yeah,
what was was it like?

913
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,600
Which time?

914
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,500
How'd you even know
what to do?

915
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,600
They told me! They said,
"Slide your hand under here.

916
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,500
Arch your back
a little more."

917
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,100
Ahh, they were
very patient.

918
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,800
They kept it up all night.

919
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,200
I still don't know where
my underpants are.

920
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,100
Why?
What happened to 'em?

921
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,700
I think they ate 'em.

922
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,700
- I made a decision.
- What?

923
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,500
I'm leaving.

924
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,500
What?

925
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,500
That's stupid.
Where are you gonna go?

926
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,000
I don't know.
Home probably.

927
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,800
I mean, I can't have
any fun down here

928
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,800
with my stepfather chasing me
all over the place.

929
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,600
I got a sister in Hoboken.

930
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,100
Your stepfather would
never find you there.

931
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,800
Adam, I'm not an animal.

932
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,800
My mind's made up
and nothing's gonna change it.

933
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,200
You don't have to quote me
on that or anything.

934
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,500
From the University of Connecticut,
let's hear it for Tammy!

935
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,300
You can't leave, man.
Your stepfather's not going to find you.

936
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,400
- That was just luck yesterday.
- That's what I told him.

937
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,100
You're gonna drive yourself
apeshit worrying about it.

938
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,900
I said exactly the same thing.

939
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,900
You gotta go on with it.
You know what I mean? Right, OT?

940
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,800
- Fuck 'im.
- I said that too.

941
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,500
Let me see if I got this:

942
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,300
I gotta stay cool,

943
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,800
gotta go with it
and I gotta fuck 'im.

944
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,400
You got it, pal.

945
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,100
Really.

946
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,100
Number 10,
must be a friend of Brenda's...

947
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,800
What?

948
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,600
That's her.

949
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,600
- That's her on the stage.
- Which one?

950
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,200
Which one do you think it is?

951
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,100
Let's see who's gonna
win this contest.

952
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,400
What we're gonna do now is allow
the girls to walk around the pool.

953
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,800
- Hey, yo!
- Let's hear it for Kim.

954
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,300
Hey! Hey, it's me! Hey!
What's your name?

955
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,700
Let's hear it
for all the beautiful ladies up here!

956
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,500
How about Kim from
the University of Alabama? Come on!

957
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,700
What's your name?

958
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,300
Come on, let's hear it for 'em!
Make some noise.

959
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,100
Hey, it's me!
What's your name?

960
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,900
Number two,
from Ohio State,

961
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,000
Susie!

962
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,800
All right! How about Susie?
Come on.

963
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:22,000
Hey, Susie!
Susie! Susie!

964
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,700
Excuse me. Hey!

965
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,400
Hi. Hi.

966
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,700
Look!
Hey, guys, this is her!

967
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,500
- Right here!
- Hey, buddy! Yay!

968
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,600
- What happened to you?
- I got lost.

969
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,100
- It's okay.
- I got lost. I didn't know your name.

970
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,500
- What's yours?
- It's Nelson.

971
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,400
- Nelson.
- I thought you left.

972
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,500
I was going to
but I wanted to see you.

973
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,800
- Really?
- Yes.

974
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,800
We're having a party at the Breeze n'
Seas Motel tonight. Can you make it?

975
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,800
I'd love to.
But promise me one thing.

976
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,400
- What?
- You won't get thirsty.

977
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,500
Sure.

978
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,800
The man of the hour!

979
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,400
Hey!

980
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,500
- Did you see her?
- Yeah, she's beautiful.

981
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,900
Yeah, I know.
She stayed to see me.

982
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,100
I found him!

983
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,000
- I said I would.
- Where is he?

984
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,900
Now Mr. Dalby,
with all due respect,

985
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,500
I don't want to tell you that
just yet.

986
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,600
I want to just make sure that
our little deal is still on.

987
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,600
You know what I mean?
The bribe money.

988
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,500
Of course I know.
I'm not an idiot.

989
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,000
You'll get your money when
I get my stepson.

990
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,400
Right. Listen, you mind if
I borrow your two boys?

991
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,800
They might come in handy.

992
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,600
Besides, I think it would be
a good idea

993
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,000
- if they see how I work.
- All right, all right.

994
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,400
I bet you think
I'm pretty amazing, huh?

995
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:00,100
Hey, baby,
looking for some action

996
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,800
Come on,
get some satisfaction

997
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,300
Anyplace
is all right

998
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,000
Anything you plan

999
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,000
Any way we want to

1000
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,400
So come on,
go with me and we can

1001
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,300
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1002
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,100
Have some fun tonight

1003
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:28,200
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1004
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,200
Make you feel all right

1005
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,200
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1006
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,200
Have some fun tonight

1007
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,100
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho...

1008
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

1009
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,000
Make you feel all right

1010
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,500
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1011
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,500
Have some fun tonight

1012
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,500
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1013
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,400
Make you feel all right

1014
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,100
When we wake tomorrow

1015
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,800
If you think you can

1016
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,700
We can start all over

1017
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:30,200
So come on and
come with me and we can

1018
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,000
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1019
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,800
Have some fun tonight

1020
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,900
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1021
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,800
Make you feel all right

1022
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,900
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1023
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:48,000
Have some fun tonight

1024
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,700
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1025
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,700
Make you feel all right

1026
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,700
Whoa ho ho ho ho ho ho

1027
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,000
Have some fun tonight.

1028
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,300
Hey, who are those turkeys
with your brother-in-law?

1029
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,000
I don't know, but I'll lay you odds
they're not Boy Scouts.

1030
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:17,400
Um, those are the guys... the ones
that work for my stepfather.

1031
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
- What are they doing with that creep?
- Let's go ask 'em.

1032
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,000
- Shit.
- We can deal with this.

1033
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,100
- Wow.
- Eesh.

1034
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,400
Don't make waves

1035
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,400
Gotta be cool, junior

1036
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,400
Stay away...

1037
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,800
- What's the rush, Eddie?
- I was just looking for a friend.

1038
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,600
You're gonna be looking
for a long time.

1039
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,300
Come on, come on.

1040
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,100
Here!
Go go go go! Fast!

1041
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,500
Gentlemen,
you can't leave now.

1042
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,400
Have you heard of
a boom-boom cocktail

1043
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,600
with rum, vodka,
fruit and juices?

1044
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,800
You haven't tried it?
You have to try it before you go.

1045
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,400
It's our claim to fame!

1046
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,400
Haa!

1047
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,200
Come on!

1048
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,500
Son of a bitch!
Son of a...

1049
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,700
Son of a bitch!

1050
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,800
Oh, I just love the ocean.

1051
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,200
Nelson, come on.
Sit down.

1052
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,000
You'll feel better.

1053
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,200
Hey, what's the matter?

1054
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,200
Nothing. Um...

1055
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,000
I just wanted this
to be perfect.

1056
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:07,000
And I'm sorry
all this happened.

1057
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,200
Hey, it's not your fault.

1058
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,800
You couldn't help it.

1059
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Um...

1060
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,400
I got... could you wait here?
I'll be right back.

1061
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,000
Really, um...

1062
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,000
- Where are you going?
- Right... just over... hang on.

1063
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:04,000
Waah!

1064
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,900
Hey, whoa.

1065
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,100
Susie!

1066
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,200
Susie!

1067
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,600
Susie! Susie!

1068
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,500
Oh, Nelson!

1069
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,900
Nelson.

1070
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,300
Here he is in
all his glory.

1071
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:21,400
The honor student!
The future lawyer!

1072
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,800
- The candidate's son!
- Stepson.

1073
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,100
Don't you talk back to me,
you little wimp.

1074
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,700
You could have ruined me.

1075
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,600
You didn't even know
that the testimonial was here

1076
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,500
and not in Miami, did you?
No.

1077
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,100
- Dad, l...
- Shut up!

1078
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,900
To think that it has
come down

1079
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,500
to the complete and
outright disregard

1080
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,500
for everything that
I stand for.

1081
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,400
I was just trying to
have some fun.

1082
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,800
Fun?

1083
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,500
Fun!

1084
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,400
Reeling around like
a drunken cretin,

1085
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,100
chasing after every
teenybopper in sight,

1086
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:57,400
indulging every whim...
you call that fun?

1087
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,600
Yes.

1088
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,800
I will not have you running around
in public acting like a fool

1089
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,300
and dressing like
a hermaphrodite.

1090
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,000
You are a shame
and a disgrace.

1091
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,700
Your mother is sick
to death about this.

1092
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,000
- Where is she?
- Out shopping.

1093
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,300
- Look, Dad...
- I don't want to hear it.

1094
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,000
Why not?

1095
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:22,700
From the way you're acting, you'd think
I was killing baby seals or...

1096
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,400
Nelson!

1097
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,700
Look, nothing is
wrong with this.

1098
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,200
Nobody's having a bad time. I mean,
nobody's gotten hurt.

1099
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,300
I'm having about the best time
I've had in my whole life.

1100
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,500
Just let me go back
to the hotel, all right? Please?

1101
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,500
You're staying right here.

1102
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,800
There's nothing to go back to anyway.
Believe me.

1103
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,800
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Never mind.

1104
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
You are trying to buy
the hotel, aren't you?

1105
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,300
Yes.

1106
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,600
And if a circus college went up
in its place,

1107
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,600
it would be a big improvement.
I've heard the stories.

1108
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,700
You can't do that.

1109
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,300
Hey!

1110
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,600
Real fair. Real fair.
Two against one, right?

1111
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:10,700
I'm wearing a towel!

1112
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,500
You'd better control yourself,
young man.

1113
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,900
It's being done for me,
thank you.

1114
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:19,500
Why don't you really throw out
the welcome mat and just lock me up?

1115
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,200
I've just got
this funny feeling.

1116
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,500
All you got is funny feelings,
Adam.

1117
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,100
- Let me see your tongue.
- Will you guys get serious?

1118
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,400
He should have
called in by now.

1119
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,200
Hey, with that chick
in that car

1120
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,000
with that backseat,
we may never see him again.

1121
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,700
Really, man, I don't see any reason
to get so crazy about it...

1122
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,400
- Oh Adam!
- What happened?

1123
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,300
- Where's Nelson?
- They took him.

1124
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,300
Who?
The guys from last night?

1125
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,000
They just shoved him in the car
and drove away. It was terrible.

1126
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,300
Okay, now can I worry?
You guys think you know everything.

1127
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:12,100
That's him!

1128
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,900
- You fat jerk!
- Hey, wait!

1129
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,300
- Hey hey hey hey!
- Back back back!

1130
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,800
Hey,
we want to talk to you!

1131
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,700
You again?

1132
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,700
What's the matter?
You want some more?

1133
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:29,700
- All right, take it easy.
- What's this, the color guard?

1134
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,100
Mr. Ames has something here that
he'd like to read to you.

1135
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,200
Take it away, Mr. Ames.

1136
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,500
"In violation of its safety code,

1137
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:42,500
the Unsafe Buildings Commission
hereby orders the Breeze n' Seas Motel

1138
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:46,000
closed until further notice,
effective immediately."

1139
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,800
What crock is this of?

1140
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,900
You can appeal.

1141
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,200
She can get a hearing in, what?
Say six to eight weeks?

1142
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,700
Perhaps.

1143
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:58,900
You know damn well if you close me
down now, I'll have to sell the place.

1144
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,800
Yes, I know. I know.

1145
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,100
- Uh, may I?
- Oh, all right.

1146
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,700
"All guests are instructed to
remove their personal effects

1147
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,100
and vacate the premises
as of sunset."

1148
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,600
- Dated today.
- Get him out of here!

1149
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,000
Son of a bitch got me.

1150
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,200
No, it's not over yet.

1151
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,200
- That's bullshit.
- No way this is over.

1152
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,200
This is gonna change
our plans this evening.

1153
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,700
Really?

1154
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,300
- You see anything?
- No.

1155
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,600
Why does OT have
a knife in his mouth?

1156
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,800
Does he really expect trouble?

1157
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:28,500
Nah, he always wanted to swim with one.
He saw it once on television.

1158
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,900
"...your consideration,

1159
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,600
and yes, your trust.
I will not disappoint you.

1160
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,600
Thank you all."

1161
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,100
Nelson?

1162
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,500
- Nice to see you too.
- Sorry.

1163
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,800
- What was that?
- Probably just a fish jumping.

1164
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,700
Hyah!

1165
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,400
Go for it, Nelson!

1166
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,700
- What was that?
- More fish.

1167
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,700
Ahhh!

1168
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,900
Go go go!

1169
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,400
Come on, get up there!

1170
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,900
- Ahhh!
Nelson, you come back here!

1171
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,500
Ahhh!

1172
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,400
Oh, go go go go go!

1173
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,200
Nelson, come back here!

1174
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,800
Ernest!
Ernest, what's going on?

1175
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,600
Never mind!
I'll tell you later!

1176
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,900
Never mind "never mind."
You tell me now.

1177
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,600
Susie walked into the room, you'd
think she was the only one there...

1178
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,000
Ooh!

1179
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,700
When she walked into the world
and dropped the drinks in the dirt

1180
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,300
And they'd stare,
but who cares...

1181
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,500
Go go go go go!

1182
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,500
Susie used to go out...

1183
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,100
'Cause Susie dated all the guys

1184
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,500
They'd go for her,
she only had to choose

1185
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,300
Or you lose

1186
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:13,700
Here comes trouble,
here comes trouble

1187
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,900
Susie means trouble

1188
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,800
Oh yeah

1189
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,500
Oh yeah, oh yeah

1190
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,700
Here comes trouble

1191
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,900
Here comes
trouble

1192
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,800
Here comes trouble

1193
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,600
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1194
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,800
Holy shit.

1195
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,100
Ahhh!

1196
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,400
Get them!

1197
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:25,000
What in hell is this?

1198
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,500
Let them go... now.

1199
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,700
God damn it, did you hear me?

1200
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,600
Untie them.

1201
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:42,100
Or I'll see to it that the police
throw you all in jail

1202
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:44,600
- and that you rot there for a week.
No!

1203
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,100
Nelson.

1204
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,200
- Get out of my way.
- No.

1205
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:59,700
You are asking for
very big trouble.

1206
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:02,700
- Now step aside.
- Damn it, I said no.

1207
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,600
I'm through stepping
aside for you.

1208
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,100
And that goes for getting pushed aside,
held back and screwed over too.

1209
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
You have gone too far
this time.

1210
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:18,300
No, I think it's you
that's gone too far.

1211
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,000
Mr. Ames?

1212
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,700
Where'd you say you got that
$5,000 from?

1213
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,500
- Eddie Potmore.
- Mmm!

1214
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,400
And where did he get it?

1215
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,500
F-from Mr. Dalby.

1216
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,600
And what did you say it was?

1217
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:42,600
- A bribe to close the motel.
- That's a lie!

1218
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,900
Mm-hmm!
Mm-hmm!

1219
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,200
- Is that a lie?
- No.

1220
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,100
No no no.

1221
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,600
I'm sorry,
I forgot to introduce you.

1222
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,200
- These are my friends, the witnesses.
Hi.

1223
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,000
Well, I guess you'd better go
call the police now.

1224
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,900
And tell 'em we'd like to
talk to 'em too, okay?

1225
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,600
Ernest, is this true?

1226
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,200
Nelson, let's be reasonable.

1227
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,900
Oh my God.

1228
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:16,900
- Does anybody want to be reasonable?
No.

1229
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,700
Nelson, for God's sake!

1230
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,100
If this ever gets out...

1231
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,000
Well, okay.

1232
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,300
If you agree to keep
the hotel open

1233
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:31,400
and guarantee that it'll stay open
with Geri as the owner,

1234
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,200
I guess we don't have to
talk about any bribe.

1235
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:49,400
It's a deal.

1236
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,600
I want to talk to you.

1237
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:03,300
It's finally time now

1238
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,200
I've been waiting all year...

1239
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,900
You plotted.
You bribed people.

1240
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:10,100
You kept my only son
a prisoner.

1241
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:13,000
You are nothing but a sneaky
disgusting liar,

1242
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,400
and I have had it. I'm taking back
every cent I put into your campaign.

1243
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:20,000
Stop talking nonsense.
There are 300 guests

1244
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:23,100
and a six-piece console waiting
for us across town.

1245
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,500
And we are damned well going...
together.

1246
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,500
- No!
- What?

1247
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,700
You go alone.
And get used to it,

1248
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:31,000
because not only am
I leaving you with nothing,

1249
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:33,600
- I am leaving you, period.
- Fine! Fine!

1250
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,900
Have your little tantrum.
I don't need you.

1251
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,400
I don't need anybody
to reach the Senate.

1252
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:41,800
My real friends are waiting.
To hell with all of you.

1253
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,500
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't get me wet!

1254
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,800
You're ruining my jacket.
Please.

1255
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:49,400
Stop, damn it. Oh!

1256
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,200
Thanks for sticking up
for me, fellas.

1257
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,200
No problem!

1258
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,000
- Get out of the car, please, sir.
- Yes, Officer.

1259
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,000
Let's see your license
and registration, sir.

1260
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:20,000
All right here.
You must understand,

1261
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,700
I am on my way to
a very important political dinner.

1262
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,500
- License please, sir.
- Right there.

1263
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,900
Yes.
Sir, have you been drinking?

1264
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,400
Drinking? No no no.
It was poured all over me.

1265
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,400
Sheriff, pour him
into the backseat.

1266
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,700
I am already very late,
as I've stated.

1267
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,100
I think I should...
I think I should warn you,

1268
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,200
the mayor is a very close
friend of mine.

1269
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,900
He always speaks well
of you, sir.

1270
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,500
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

1271
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,600
- Damn it, do you know who I am?
- No, sir, I've got it right here.

1272
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,600
- Oh shit!
- You have a real way with words, sir.

1273
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:53,500
Lovin'
with the Lauderdale ladies

1274
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,600
Playin'
in the Lauderdale sun

1275
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,000
Lovin' with
the Lauderdale ladies...

1276
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,700
- Oh!
- For the garden.

1277
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:10,100
And you won't be going home
till you find the one...

1278
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,400
Bye.

1279
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:16,000
Well, everybody... here.

1280
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:19,300
- Ashtrays.
- Thank you.

1281
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:21,000
They steal them anyway.

1282
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,300
Oh.

1283
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,900
Oh, here's your car.

1284
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,000
Hey.

1285
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:38,100
They miss you.

1286
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,200
Jeez.

1287
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:50,900
Lovin'
with the Lauderdale ladies...

1288
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,600
Will you move already?
Come on.

1289
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:55,100
All right, get over there.
I've got this great idea.

1290
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,000
Okay, I know how tough it is
for you guys,

1291
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,600
but please try to act like
you're having some fun.

1292
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,000
Just a second!

1293
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,000
Whoo hoo hoo hoo

1294
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,900
Whoo hoo
hoo hoo

1295
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:23,500
Whoo hoo hoo hoo

1296
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:27,900
Well, I work so hard

1297
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:30,200
From September to December

1298
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,200
But that was so long ago

1299
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,600
I hardly remember

1300
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:41,100
Now I need the old crazy sun

1301
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:43,300
Better than ever

1302
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,000
Now I know hard ways but

1303
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:49,200
Still things'll get better

1304
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,200
Well

1305
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:54,000
Do you think I need a break?

1306
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,200
I need a spring break

1307
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,700
It's how I still believe
it's what I really need

1308
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,500
I need a spring break

1309
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:08,700
It's been so long
since I've been gone

1310
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,800
And I can't go on till

1311
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,100
I get down

1312
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,200
To the action, honey

1313
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,700
Into the sand

1314
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,500
Well, it's last stop, honey

1315
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,600
And I got a plan

1316
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,200
Well, do you think

1317
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:35,000
I need a break?

1318
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,200

1320
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,400

Ooh, I need a break

1326

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
